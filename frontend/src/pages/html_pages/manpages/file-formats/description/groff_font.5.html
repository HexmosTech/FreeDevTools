       groff_font - GNU <u>roff</u> device and font description files

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>groff</u> font and output device description formats are slight extensions of those used by AT&amp;T device-
       independent <u>troff</u>.  In distinction to the AT&amp;T implementation, <u>groff</u> lacks a binary format; all files are
       text files.  (Plan 9 <u>troff</u> has also abandoned the binary format.)  The device and font description  files
       for  a  device  <u>name</u> are stored in a <u>dev</u>name directory.  The device description file is called <u>DESC</u>, and,
       for each font supported by the device, a font description file  is  called  <u>f,</u>  where  <u>f</u>  is  usually  an
       abbreviation  of  a  font's  name  and/or  style.  For example, the <b>ps</b> (PostScript) device has <u>groff</u> font
       description files for Times roman (<b>TR</b>) and Zapf Chancery Medium italic (<b>ZCMI</b>), among many  others,  while
       the  <b>utf8</b>  device  (for  terminal  emulators) has only font descriptions for the roman, italic, bold, and
       bold-italic styles (<b>R</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>BI</b>, respectively).

       Device and font description files are read by the formatter, <u>troff</u>, and by output drivers.  The  programs
       typically  delegate  these  files' processing to an internal library, <u>libgroff</u>, ensuring their consistent
       interpretation.

<u><b>DESC</b></u> <b>file</b> <b>format</b>
       The <u>DESC</u> file contains a series of directives; each begins a line.  Their order is  not  important,  with
       two exceptions: (1) the <b>res</b> directive must precede any <b>papersize</b> directive; and (2) the <b>charset</b> directive
       must come last (if at all).  If a directive name is repeated, later entries in the file override previous
       ones  (except  that the paper dimensions are computed based on the <b>res</b> directive last seen when <b>papersize</b>
       is encountered).  Spaces and/or tabs separate words and are ignored at line boundaries.   Comments  start
       with the “<b>#</b>” character and extend to the end of a line.  Empty lines are ignored.

       <b>family</b> <u>fam</u>
              The default font family is <u>fam</u>.

       <b>fonts</b> <u>n</u> <u>F1</u> ... <u>Fn</u>
              Fonts <u>F1</u>, ..., <u>Fn</u> are mounted at font positions <u>m</u>+1, ..., <u>m</u>+<u>n</u> where <u>m</u> is the number of <b>styles</b> (see
              below).  This directive may extend over more than one line.  A font name of <b>0</b> causes no font to be
              mounted at the corresponding position.

       <b>hor</b> <u>n</u>  The  horizontal  motion  quantum is <u>n</u> basic units.  Horizontal quantities are rounded to multiples
              of <u>n.</u>

       <b>image_generator</b> <u>program</u>
              Use <u>program</u> to generate PNG images from PostScript input.  Under GNU/Linux, this is usually <u><a href="../man1/gs.1.html">gs</a></u>(1),
              but under other systems (notably Cygwin) it might be set to another name.  The  <u><a href="../man1/grohtml.1.html">grohtml</a></u>(1)  driver
              uses this directive.

       <b>paperlength</b> <u>n</u>
              The vertical dimension of the output medium is <u>n</u> basic units (deprecated: use <b>papersize</b> instead).

       <b>papersize</b> <u>format-or-dimension-pair-or-file-name</u> ...
              The  dimensions  of the output medium are as according to the argument, which is either a standard
              paper format, a pair of dimensions, or the name of a plain text  file  containing  either  of  the
              foregoing.   Recognized  paper formats are the ISO and DIN formats <b>A0</b>–<b>A7</b>, <b>B0</b>–<b>B7</b>, <b>C0</b>–<b>C7</b>, and <b>D0</b>–<b>D7</b>;
              the U.S. formats <b>letter</b>, <b>legal</b>, <b>tabloid</b>,  <b>ledger</b>,  <b>statement</b>,  and  <b>executive</b>;  and  the  envelope
              formats <b>com10</b>, <b>monarch</b>, and <b>DL</b>.  Matching is performed without regard for lettercase.

              Alternatively,  the  argument  can be a custom paper format <u>length</u><b>,</b><u>width</u> (with no spaces before or
              after the comma).  Both <u>length</u> and <u>width</u> must have a  unit  appended;  valid  units  are  “<b>i</b>”  for
              inches, “<b>c</b>” for centimeters, “<b>p</b>” for points, and “<b>P</b>” for picas.  Example: “<b>12c,235p</b>”.  An argument
              that starts with a digit is always treated as a custom paper format.

              Finally,  the  argument  can be a file name (e.g., <u>/etc/papersize</u>); if the file can be opened, the
              first line is read and a match attempted against each other form.  No comment syntax is supported.

              More than one argument can be specified; each is  scanned  in  turn  and  the  first  valid  paper
              specification used.

       <b>paperwidth</b> <u>n</u>
              The  horizontal  dimension  of  the  output  medium  is  <u>n</u>  basic units (deprecated: use <b>papersize</b>
              instead).

       <b>pass_filenames</b>
              Direct <u>troff</u> to emit the name of the source file being  processed.   This  is  achieved  with  the
              intermediate output command “<b>x</b> <b>F</b>”, which <u>grohtml</u> interprets.

       <b>postpro</b> <u>program</u>
              Use <u>program</u> as the postprocessor.

       <b>prepro</b> <u>program</u>
              Use <u>program</u> as a preprocessor.  The <b>html</b> and <b>xhtml</b> output devices use this directive.

       <b>print</b> <u>program</u>
              Use <u>program</u> as the print spooler.  If omitted, <u>groff</u>'s <b>-l</b> and <b>-L</b> options are ignored.

       <b>res</b> <u>n</u>  The device resolution is <u>n</u> basic units per inch.

       <b>sizes</b> <u>s1</u> ... <u>sn</u> <b>0</b>
              The  device  has  fonts  at  <u>s1</u>,  ...,  <u>sn</u>  scaled  points (see below).  The list of sizes must be
              terminated by a <b>0</b>.  Each <u>si</u> can also be a range of sizes <u>m</u>–<u>n</u>.  The list can extend over more  than
              one line.

       <b>sizescale</b> <u>n</u>
              A typographical point is subdivided into <u>n</u> scaled points.  The default is <b>1</b>.

       <b>styles</b> <u>S1</u> ... <u>Sm</u>
              The first <u>m</u> font mounting positions are associated with styles <u>S1</u>, ..., <u>Sm</u>.

       <b>tcommand</b>
              The postprocessor can handle the <b>t</b> and <b>u</b> intermediate output commands.

       <b>unicode</b>
              The  output  device  supports  the complete Unicode repertoire.  This directive is useful only for
              devices which produce character entities instead of glyphs.

              If <b>unicode</b> is present, no <b>charset</b> section is required in the  font  description  files  since  the
              Unicode  handling  built  into <u>groff</u> is used.  However, if there are entries in a font description
              file's <b>charset</b> section, they either override the default mappings for those particular  characters
              or add new mappings (normally for composite characters).

              The <b>utf8</b>, <b>html</b>, and <b>xhtml</b> output devices use this directive.

       <b>unitwidth</b> <u>n</u>
              Quantities  in the font description files are in basic units for fonts whose type size is <u>n</u> scaled
              points.

       <b>unscaled_charwidths</b>
              Make the font handling module always return unscaled glyph widths.  The <u>grohtml</u> driver  uses  this
              directive.

       <b>use_charnames_in_special</b>
              <u>troff</u>  should  encode  named  glyphs inside device control commands.  The <u>grohtml</u> driver uses this
              directive.

       <b>vert</b> <u>n</u> The vertical motion quantum is <u>n</u> basic units.  Vertical quantities are rounded to multiples of <u>n.</u>

       <b>charset</b>
              This directive and the rest of the file are ignored.  It  is  recognized  for  compatibility  with
              other  <u>troff</u>  implementations.   In GNU <u>troff</u>, character set repertoire is described on a per-font
              basis.

       <u>troff</u> recognizes but ignores the directives <b>spare1</b>, <b>spare2</b>, and <b>biggestfont</b>.

       The <b>res</b>, <b>unitwidth</b>, <b>fonts</b>, and <b>sizes</b> lines are mandatory.  Directives not listed  above  are  ignored  by
       <u>troff</u> but may be used by postprocessors to obtain further information about the device.

</pre><h4><b>Font</b> <b>description</b> <b>file</b> <b>format</b></h4><pre>
       On  typesetting  output  devices,  each  font  is  typically  available  at  multiple sizes.  While paper
       measurements in the device description file are in absolute units, measurements applicable to fonts  must
       be proportional to the type size.  <u>groff</u> achieves this using the precedent set by AT&amp;T device-independent
       <u>troff</u>: one font size is chosen as a norm, and all others are scaled linearly relative to that basis.  The
       “unit width” is the number of basic units per point when the font is rendered at this nominal size.

       For  instance,  <u>groff</u>'s <b>lbp</b> device uses a <b>unitwidth</b> of 800.  Its Times roman font (“<b>TR</b>”) has a <b>spacewidth</b>
       of 833; this is also the width of its comma, period, centered period, and  mathematical  asterisk,  while
       its  “M”  is  2,963  basic units.  Thus, an “M” on the <b>lbp</b> device is 2,963 basic units wide at a notional
       type size of 800 points.  (800-point type is not practical for most purposes, but using  it  enables  the
       quantities in the font description files to be expressed as integers.)

       A font description file has two sections.  The first is a sequence of directives, and is parsed similarly
       to  the  <u>DESC</u>  file described above.  Except for the directive names that begin the second section, their
       ordering is immaterial.  Later directives of the same name override earlier ones,  spaces  and  tabs  are
       handled in the same way, and the same comment syntax is supported.  Empty lines are ignored throughout.

       <b>name</b> <u>F</u> The  name of the font is <u>F</u>.  “<b>DESC</b>” is an invalid font name.  Simple integers are valid, but their
              use is discouraged.  (<u>groff</u> requests and escape sequences interpret  non-negative  font  names  as
              mounting  positions  instead.   Further,  a  font named “<b>0</b>” cannot be automatically mounted by the
              <b>fonts</b> directive of a <u>DESC</u> file.)

       <b>spacewidth</b> <u>n</u>
              The width of an unadjusted inter-word space is <u>n</u> basic units.

       The directives above must appear in the first section; those below are optional.

       <b>slant</b> <u>n</u>
              The font's glyphs have a slant of <u>n</u> degrees; a positive <u>n</u> slants in the direction of text flow.

       <b>ligatures</b> <u>lig1</u> ... <u>lign</u> [<b>0</b>]
              Glyphs <u>lig1</u>, ..., <u>lign</u> are ligatures; possible ligatures are  <b>ff</b>,  <b>fi</b>,  <b>fl</b>,  <b>ffi</b>,  and  <b>ffl</b>.   For
              compatibility  with other <u>troff</u> implementations, the list of ligatures may be terminated with a <b>0</b>.
              The list of ligatures must not extend over more than one line.

       <b>special</b>
              The font is <u>special</u>: when a glyph is requested that is not present in  the  current  font,  it  is
              sought in any mounted fonts that bear this property.

       Other  directives  in  this  section  are  ignored  by <u>troff</u>, but may be used by postprocessors to obtain
       further information about the font.

       The second section contains one or two subsections.  These can appear in  either  order;  the  first  one
       encountered  commences  the second section.  Each starts with a directive on a line by itself.  A <b>charset</b>
       subsection is mandatory unless  the  associated  <u>DESC</u>  file  contains  the  <b>unicode</b>  directive.   Another
       subsection, <b>kernpairs</b>, is optional.

       The  directive  <b>charset</b>  starts the character set subsection.  (For typesetter devices, this directive is
       misnamed since it starts a list of glyphs, not characters.)  It precedes a series of glyph  descriptions,
       one  per  line.   Each  such  glyph description comprises a set of fields separated by spaces or tabs and
       organized as follows.

              <u>name</u> <u>metrics</u> <u>type</u> <u>code</u> [<u>entity-name</u>] [<b>--</b> <u>comment</u>]

       <u>name</u> identifies the glyph: if <u>name</u> is a printable character <u>c</u>,  it  corresponds  to  the  <u>troff</u>  ordinary
       character <u>c</u>.  If <u>name</u> is a multi-character sequence not beginning with <b>\</b>, it corresponds to the GNU <u>troff</u>
       special  character  escape  sequence “<b>\[</b><u>name</u><b>]</b>”.  A name consisting of three minus signs, “<b>---</b>”, indicates
       that the glyph is unnamed: such glyphs can be accessed only by  the  <b>\N</b>  escape  sequence  in  <u>troff</u>.   A
       special  character  named  “<b>---</b>”  can  still  be defined using <b>.char</b> and similar requests.  The <u>name</u> “<b>\-</b>”
       defines the minus sign glyph.  Finally, <u>name</u> can be the horizontal motion escape  sequences,  <b>\|</b>  and  <b>\^</b>
       (“thin” and “hair” spaces, respectively), in which case only the width metric described below is applied;
       a font can thus customize the widths of these spaces.

       The form of the <u>metrics</u> field is as follows (on one line; it may be broken here for readability).

              <u>width</u>[<b>,</b>[<u>height</u>[<b>,</b>[<u>depth</u>[<b>,</b>[<u>italic-correction</u>[<b>,</b>[<u>left-italic-correction</u>[<b>,</b>[
              <u>subscript-correction</u>]]]]]]]]]]

       There  must  not  be  any  spaces,  tabs,  or  newlines between these <u>subfields,</u> which are in basic units
       expressed as decimal integers.  Unspecified subfields default to <b>0</b>.  Since there is no associated  binary
       format,  these  values  are  not  required  to fit into the C language data type <b>char</b> as they are in AT&amp;T
       device-independent <u>troff</u>.

       The <u>width</u> subfield gives the width of the glyph.  The <u>height</u> subfield  gives  the  height  of  the  glyph
       (upwards  is  positive); if a glyph does not extend above the baseline, it should be given a zero height,
       rather than a negative height.  The <u>depth</u> subfield gives the depth of the glyph, that  is,  the  distance
       below  the  baseline to which the glyph extends (downwards is positive); if a glyph does not extend below
       the baseline, it should be given a zero depth, rather than a  negative  depth.   Italic  corrections  are
       relevant to glyphs in italic or oblique styles.  The <u>italic-correction</u> is the amount of space that should
       be  added  after  an  oblique  glyph  to  be  followed immediately by an upright glyph.  The <u>left-italic-</u>
       <u>correction</u> is the amount of space that should be added before an oblique glyph to be preceded immediately
       by an upright glyph.  The <u>subscript-correction</u> is the amount of space  that  should  be  added  after  an
       oblique glyph to be followed by a subscript; it should be less than the italic correction.

       For  fonts used with typesetting devices, the <u>type</u> field gives a featural description of the glyph: it is
       a bit mask recording whether the glyph is an ascender, descender, both, or neither.   When  a  <b>\w</b>  escape
       sequence  is  interpolated,  these  values are bitwise or-ed together for each glyph and stored in the <b>ct</b>
       register.  In font descriptions for terminal devices, all glyphs might have a type of zero, regardless of
       their appearance.

       0      means the glyph lies entirely between the baseline and a horizontal line at the “x-height” of  the
              font, as with “a”, “c”, and “x”;

       1      means the glyph descends below the baseline, like “p”;

       2      means the glyph ascends above the font's x-height, like “A” or “b”); and

       3      means the glyph is both an ascender and a descender—this is true of parentheses in some fonts.

       The <u>code</u> field gives a numeric identifier that the postprocessor uses to render the glyph.  The glyph can
       be  specified  to  <u>troff</u> using this code by means of the <b>\N</b> escape sequence.  The code can be any integer
       (that is, any integer parsable by the C standard library's <u><a href="../man3/strtol.3.html">strtol</a></u>(3) function).

       The <u>entity-name</u> field defines an identifier for the glyph that the postprocessor uses to print the  <u>troff</u>
       glyph <u>name</u>.  This field is optional; it was introduced so that the <u>grohtml</u> output driver could encode its
       character  set.   For  example, the glyph <b>\[Po]</b> is represented by “<b>&amp;pound;</b>” in HTML 4.0.  For efficiency,
       these data are now compiled directly into <u>grohtml</u>.  <u>grops</u> uses the field to build sub-encoding arrays for
       PostScript fonts containing more than 256 glyphs.  Anything on the line after the  <u>entity-name</u>  field  or
       “<b>--</b>” is ignored.

       A line in the <b>charset</b> section can also have the form
              <u>name</u> <b>"</b>
       identifying  <u>name</u>  as  another  name  for the glyph mentioned in the preceding line.  Such aliases can be
       chained.

       The directive <b>kernpairs</b> starts a list of kerning adjustments to be made to adjacent glyph pairs from this
       font.  It contains a sequence of lines formatted as follows.
              <u>g1</u> <u>g2</u> <u>n</u>
       The foregoing means that when glyph <u>g1</u> is typeset immediately before <u>g2</u>, the space between them should be
       increased by <u>n</u>.  Most kerning pairs should have a negative value for <u>n</u>.
