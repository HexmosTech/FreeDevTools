</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ModuleEchoLink.conf - Configuration file for the SvxLink server EchoLink module

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>svxlink</b>  is  a general purpose voice service system for ham radio use. This man-page describe the SvxLink
       server configuration for the EchoLink module.

       The EchoLink module is used to connect to other EchoLink stations.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       There are a couple of configuration variables that are common to  all  modules.   The  documentation  for
       these can be found in the <b><a href="../man5/svxlink.conf.5.html">svxlink.conf</a></b>(5) manual page.

       Here  is  the description of all module specific configuration variables that the SvxLink EchoLink module
       understands.

   <b>ModuleEchoLink</b>
       <b>ALLOW_IP</b>
              Use this variable very carefully. Connections originating  from  the  given  subnet  will  not  be
              checked  against the EchoLink directory server. A typical use of this is if you want to connect to
              your own svxlink server and both the server and you are behind a IP masquerading firewall.

       <b>DROP_ALL_INCOMING</b>
              Silently drop all incoming connections.  No message will be sent to the remote  station  notifying
              about  the  drop.  The  connection  will  just be ignored and there will be no notification in the
              application log.

       <b>DROP_INCOMING</b>
              Drop all incoming connections where the remote callsign match this regular expression. No  message
              will  be sent to the remote station notifying about the drop. The connection will just be ignored.
              For more information on the syntax, see the <b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b> chapter below.

       <b>REJECT_INCOMING</b>
              Reject all incoming connections where the remote callsign match this regular expression. A message
              will be sent to the remote station indicating that the connection was rejected.  The DROP_INCOMING
              directive will be evaluated before REJECT_INCOMING.  For more information on the syntax,  see  the
              <b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b> chapter below.

       <b>ACCEPT_INCOMING</b>
              Only  accept  incoming connections where the remote callsign match this regular expression. If the
              callsign doesn't match, a message  will  be  sent  to  the  remote  station  indicating  that  the
              connection  was  rejected.   The  DROP_INCOMING  and  REJECT_INCOMING directives will be evaluated
              before ACCEPT_INCOMING.  For more information on the syntax, see the <b>REGULAR</b>  <b>EXPRESSIONS</b>  chapter
              below.

       <b>REJECT_OUTGOING</b>
              Reject  all outgoing connections where the remote callsign match this regular expression. For more
              information on the syntax, see the <b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b> chapter below.

       <b>REJECT_CONF</b>
              When this is set to 1, reject all incoming connections where the name of the remote  station  ends
              in  the word CONF. A message will be sent to the remote station indicating that the connection was
              rejected.  This blocks connects from stations that are in conference mode.  When a station  enters
              conference mode after connecting, and transmits towards us, it will be disconnected as well.

       <b>CHECK_NR_CONNECTS</b>
              If  a  station  connects  to  often  it  can  be  blocked  for  a configurable time span. Example:
              CHECK_NR_CONNECTS=3,300,120 If a station connects more than 3 times with less than 300 seconds  in
              between each connect, that station will be rejected for 120 minutes.

       <b>ACCEPT_OUTGOING</b>
              Only  accept  outgoing  connections  where  the remote callsign match this regular expression. The
              REJECT_OUTGOING directive will be evaluated before ACCEPT_OUTGOING. For more  information  on  the
              syntax, see the <b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b> chapter below.

       <b>SERVERS</b>
              A  space  separated  list  of  IP addresses or names of the EchoLink directory servers to use. The
              specified servers will be tried in order until one is found that works. SvxLink will then stick to
              that server. If that server fail, SvxLink will again try the next server in the list and when  the
              end  of  the  list  has  been  reached, the search start from the beginning again.  Hostnames that
              resolve to multiple IP addresses, like servers.echolink.org, will also  be  correctly  handled  so
              that all returned IP addresses will be tried if necessary.

       <b>CALLSIGN</b>
              The callsign to use to login to the EchoLink directory server.

       <b>SYSOPNAME</b>
              The name of the person or club that is responsible for this system.

       <b>PASSWORD</b>
              The EchoLink directory server password to use.

       <b>LOCATION</b>
              The  location  of  the  station.  Note:  In  the  default  configuration  file  the  value of this
              configuration variable starts with "[Svx]". This is of course not necessary but it's  fun  to  see
              which other stations are running SvxLink.

       <b>PROXY_SERVER</b>
              If  set,  connect to the given EchoLink proxy server host. All EchoLink connections, both incoming
              and outgoing, will then go through the proxy.

       <b>PROXY_PORT</b>
              Set the TCP port used for connecing to an EchoLink proxy server. Default is 8100.

       <b>PROXY_PASSWORD</b>
              Set the EchoLink proxy password used when connecting to an EchoLink proxy server. Use the password
              PUBLIC for public proxy servers.

       <b>BIND_ADDR</b>
              This configuration variable can be set to bind the EchoLink network  sockets  to  a  specific  IP-
              address/interface.  This  may  be  needed  if  the  computer is fitted with more than one ethernet
              interface and EchoLink should only be used on one of them.

              Example: BIND_ADDR=192.168.0.1

       <b>MAX_QSOS</b>
              The maximum number of stations that can participate in a conference QSO  on  this  node.  If  more
              stations try to connect, the connect request will be rejected.

       <b>USE_GSM_ONLY</b>
              On  smaller  systems  with a less powerful CPU it is a good idea to prevent SvxLink from switching
              into the Speex codec when another SvxLink station is connecting via EchoLink.  If  this  param  is
              set to 1 SvxLink remains in the default codec (GSM).

       <b>DEFAULT_LANG</b>
              Set  the  language to use for announcements sent to remote EchoLink stations.  If not set, it will
              be the same as the one chosen for the logic core. The reason for setting this up may be  that  you
              want  one  language  for  the  core  and another language for annoncements sent to remote EchoLink
              stations.

       <b>MAX_CONNECTIONS</b>
              When more stations than specified in MAX_QSOS try to connect, a  connection  will  temporarily  be
              established  long  enough  to  play  a  message telling the remote station that the connection was
              rejected. The connection is then immediately terminated. If  the  number  of  connections  exceeds
              MAX_CONNECTIONS, the connect request is just ignored. This variable is typically set to MAX_QSOS+1
              or more if using a large number for MAX_QSOS.

       <b>LINK_IDLE_TIMEOUT</b>
              The  number  of  seconds  that  a  connection is idle before disconnection will occur.  This is to
              prevent a link to stay open if someone forget to disconnect. Disable this feature by setting  this
              config variable to zero (or comment it out).

       <b>AUTOCON_ECHOLINK_ID</b>
              Set  this  variable  to  an  EchoLink  ID that you want to automatically connect to.  SvxLink will
              autoconnect only when no other station is connected.

       <b>AUTOCON_TIME</b>
              Set this to the time in seconds that you want in between autoconnect tries.

       <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
              A longer description that is sent to remote stations  upon  connection.  This  description  should
              typically  include  detailed  station  information like QTH, transceiver frequency/power, antenna,
              CTCSS tone frequency etc.

       <b>COMMAND_PTY</b>
              Specify the path to a PTY that can be used to control  the  EchoLink  module  from  the  operating
              system.  Commands:  "KILL" will disconnect the current talker, "DISC callsign" will disconnect the
              station with the given callsign. Commands can be issued using  a  simple  echo  command  from  the
              shell.

       <b>LOCAL_RGR_SOUND</b>
              Set  this  variable  to  0 to disable playing a roger sound (beep) locally when the remote station
              stops talking. It's enabled by default.

       <b>REMOTE_RGR_SOUND</b>
              Set this to 1 to enable sending of a roger sound (beep)  to  remote  Echolink  stations  when  the
              squelch closes on the local node. It's disabled by default.

</pre><h4><b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Regular expressions are used in the DROP, REJECT and ACCEPT configuration variables. A regular expression
       can  be quite complex and the syntax is fully described in the <b><a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex</a></b>(7) manual page. This is just a quick
       tutorial for the most important features.

       <b>^</b>      match the beginning of a string.

       <b>$</b>      match the end of a string.

       <b>.</b>      match one character.

       <b>*</b>      match the previous expression zero or more times.

       <b>|</b>      match the expression before OR after the |.

       <b>\</b>      escape the following character. Note that backslash is also parsed by  the  SvxLink  configuration
              parser  so  a backslash must actually be typed as two.  For example to include a * in the matching
              pattern it must be escaped as \\*.

       <b>()</b>     grouping an expression.

       <b>[]</b>     match any of the characters inside of the brackets.

       Some examples:

       <b>^(AB1CDE|BA5CBA-L)$</b>
              Match AB1CDE or BA5CBA-L.

       <b>^(AB1CDE-[LR])$</b>
              Match AB1CDE-L or AB1CDR-R.

       <b>^(AB1.*)$</b>
              Match all callsigns starting with AB1.

       <b>^(\\*.*\\*)$</b>
              Match all conference "callsigns". We need to escape the star character since it would otherwise be
              parsed by the regular expression parser. We also need two backslah characters so that the  SvxLink
              configuration reader doesn't parse it as an escape sequence.

       The  matches  in  SvxLink  are  case  insensitive  so "sm3" and "SM3" are the same.  SvxLink use extended
       regular expressions (see <b><a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex</a></b>(7) ). You almost always want to start the regular expression with "^(" and
       end it with ")$" so that the whole callsign will be used in the match.
