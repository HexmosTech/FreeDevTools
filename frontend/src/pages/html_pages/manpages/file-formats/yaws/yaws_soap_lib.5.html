       yaws_soap_lib - api for the yaws soap-functionality

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>yaws_soap_lib:Function(...)</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the Yaws API available for dealing with SOAP.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       all(WsdlURL, Operation, ListOfData)
              This  function  takes  an ('http' or 'file' URL to a WSDL file, an Operation (i.e. Function) to be
              called and a list of data to that the Operation takes as input argument.  Note: that this function
              makes the assumption that the record used for the body, has the same name as the  Operation.   For
              example,  if the Operation is named "GetTime", then the record it assumed to be named 'p:GetTime',
              where 'p' is the default prefix used.

       all(Wsdl, Operation, ListOfData)
              Takes a Wsdl structure, as returned from the initModel/1 function, instead of  an  URL.  Else,  it
              works just like the other call/3 function.

       all(Wsdl, Operation, ListOfData)
              Takes  a  Wsdl  structure,  as returned from the initModel/1 function, instead of an URL. Else, it
              works just like the other call/3 function.

       all(Wsdl, Operation, HeaderMsg, BodyMsg)
              The Wsdl and Operation arguments works just as for the call/3 function.  The HeaderMsg and BodyMsg
              can be either a record, representing a message, or a list of such  records.  The  records  can  be
              generated by the write_hrl/2 function.

       all(Wsdl, Operation, Port, Service, HeaderMsg, BodyMsg)
              The Wsdl, Operation, HeaderMsg and BodyMsg argument works as for the call/4 function. The Port and
              Service  argument is used for pointing out the particular definitions of the corresponding entries
              in the WSDl specification used.

       s_wsdl(Wsdl)
              Returns true if the Wsdl argument is a Wsdl structure, as returned from the initModel/1 function.

       sdl_model(Wsdl)
              Returns the Model.

       sdl_operations(Wsdl)
              Returns a list of Operations.

       sdl_op_service(Wsdl)
              Returns the Service.

       sdl_op_port(Operation)
              Returns the port.

       sdl_op_operation(Operation) -&gt; Op.
              Returns the operation.

       sdl_op_binding(Operation) -&gt; Binding.
              Returns the binding.

       sdl_op_address(Operation) -&gt; Address.
              Returns the address.

       sdl_op_action(Operation)
              Returns the action.

       nitModel(WsdlURL)
              Takes an URL pointing to an WSDL file. This function will retrieve the file, parse it and return a
              Wsdl structure that is used as argument to many of the other functions in this  module.   It  will
              use the default prefix 'p' for the elements/attributes of the target namespace.

       nitModel(WsdlURL, Prefix)
              Works as the initModel/1 function but takes another prefix to be used.

       riteHrl(WsdlURL, HrlFilename)
              Takes  an  URL  pointing  to  an  WSDL  file.  Will  produce a file containing erlang records that
              corresponds to the elements and datatypes in the WSDL file. This '.hrl' file can then be  included
              in your own Erlang code, for easy manipulation of the SOAP data.

       riteHrl(WsdlURL, HrlFilename, Prefix)
              Works as the writeHrl/2 function but takes another prefix to be used.
