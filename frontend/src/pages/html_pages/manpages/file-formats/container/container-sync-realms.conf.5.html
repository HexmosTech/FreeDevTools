</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>container-sync-realms.conf</b> - configuration file for the OpenStack Swift container sync realms

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>container-sync-realms.conf</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  the  configuration  file  used  by  the  Object storage Swift to perform container to container
       synchronization. This configuration file is used to configure  clusters  to  allow/accept  sync  requests
       to/from  other  clusters. Using this configuration file, the user specifies where to sync their container
       to along with a secret synchronization key.

       You   can   find    more    information    about    container    to    container    synchronization    at
       <u>https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_container_sync.html</u>

       The  configuration  file  follows the python-pastedeploy syntax. The file is divided into sections, which
       are enclosed by square brackets. Each section will contain a certain number of key/value parameters which
       are described later.

       Any line that begins with a '#' symbol is ignored.

       You    can    find    more    information    about    python-pastedeploy    configuration    format    at
       <u>https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pastedeploy/en/latest/#config-format</u>

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  indicated  by section named [DEFAULT]. Below are the parameters that are acceptable within this
       section.

       <b>mtime_check_interval</b>
              The number of seconds between checking the modified time of  this  config  file  for  changes  and
              therefore reloading it. The default value is 300.

</pre><h4><b>REALM</b> <b>SECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Each  section  name is the name of a sync realm, for example [realm1].  A sync realm is a set of clusters
       that have agreed to allow container syncing with  each  other.   Realm  names  will  be  considered  case
       insensitive. Below are the parameters that are acceptable within this section.

       <b>cluster_clustername1</b>
              Any values in the realm section whose name begin with cluster_ will indicate the name and endpoint
              of  a cluster and will be used by external users in their container's X-Container-Sync-To metadata
              header values with the format as "realm_name/cluster_name/container_name".  The Realm and  cluster
              names are considered to be case insensitive.

       <b>cluster_clustername2</b>
              Any values in the realm section whose name begin with cluster_ will indicate the name and endpoint
              of  a cluster and will be used by external users in their container's X-Container-Sync-To metadata
              header values with the format as "realm_name/cluster_name/container_name".  The Realm and  cluster
              names are considered to be case insensitive.

              The endpoint is what the container sync daemon will use when sending out requests to that cluster.
              Keep  in  mind  this  endpoint must be reachable by all container servers, since that is where the
              container sync daemon runs. Note that the endpoint ends with /v1/  and  that  the  container  sync
              daemon will then add the account/container/obj name after that.

       <b>key</b>    The  key  is  the  overall cluster-to-cluster key used in combination with the external users' key
              that they set on their containers' X-Container-Sync-Key metadata header values. These keys will be
              used to sign each request the container sync daemon makes  and  used  to  validate  each  incoming
              container sync request.

       <b>key2</b>   The  key2  is optional and is an additional key incoming requests will be checked against. This is
              so you can rotate keys if you wish; you move the existing key to key2 and make a new key value.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       [DEFAULT]
       mtime_check_interval = 300

       [realm1]
       key = realm1key
       key2 = realm1key2
       cluster_clustername1 = https://host1/v1/
       cluster_clustername2 = https://host2/v1/

       [realm2]
       key = realm2key
       key2 = realm2key2
       cluster_clustername3 = https://host3/v1/
       cluster_clustername4 = https://host4/v1/
