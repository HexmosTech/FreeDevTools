</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tcsd.conf - configuration file for the trousers TCS daemon.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  file,  by  default  <u>/etc/tcsd.conf</u>  is  read  by  the trousers TCSD daemon, tcsd (see <a href="../man8/tcsd.8.html">tcsd</a>(8)). The
       tcsd.conf file that is installed by trousers contains all the default options, commented out.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>port</b> The port that TCSD will listen on for connections, local and remote, from applications.

       <b>num_threads</b>  The  maximum  number  of  threads  that  the  TCSD  will  spawn  simultaneously  to  service
       applications.  After  <b>num_threads</b>  threads have been spawned, any application that attempts to connect to
       the TCSD will receive an error.

       <b>system_ps_file</b> The location of the system persistent storage file. The  system  persistent  storage  file
       holds keys and data across restarts of the TCSD and system reboots.

       <b>firmware_log_file</b>  Path  to the file containing the current firmware PCR event log data. The interface to
       this log is usually provided by the TPM device driver.

       <b>kernel_log_file</b> Path to the file containing the current kernel PCR event log data. By default, this  data
       will be parsed in the format provided by the Integrity Measurement Architecture LSM.

       <b>firmware_pcrs</b>  A  list  of PCR indices that are manipulated only by the system firmware and therefore are
       not extended or logged by the TCSD. Applications that  call  Tcsi_PcrExtend  on  PCRs  listed  here  will
       receive an error.

       <b>kernel_pcrs</b>  A list of PCR indices that are manipulated only by the kernel and therefore are not extended
       or logged by the TCSD. Applications that call Tcsi_PcrExtend on PCRs listed here will receive an error.

       <b>platform_cred</b> Path to the platform credential for your TPM.  Your TPM manufacturer may have provided  you
       with  a  set  of  credentials (certificates) that should be used when creating identities using your TPM.
       When a user of your TPM makes an identity, this credential will be encrypted as part of that process. See
       the 1.1b TPM Main specification section 9.3 for information on this process.

       <b>conformance_cred</b> Path to the conformance credential  for  your  TPM.   Your  TPM  manufacturer  may  have
       provided  you with a set of credentials (certificates) that should be used when creating identities using
       your TPM. When a user of your TPM makes an identity, this credential will be encrypted as  part  of  that
       process. See the 1.1b TPM Main specification section 9.3 for information on this process.

       <b>endorsement_cred</b>  Path  to  the  endorsement  credential  for  your  TPM.  Your TPM manufacturer may have
       provided you with a set of credentials (certificates) that should be used when creating identities  using
       your  TPM.  When  a user of your TPM makes an identity, this credential will be encrypted as part of that
       process. See the 1.1b TPM Main specification section 9.3 for information on this process.

       <b>remote_ops</b> A list of TCS commands which will be allowed to be executed on this machine's TCSD by TSP's on
       non-local hosts (over the internet). By default, access to all operations is denied.

       <b>host_platform_class</b> Determines the TCG specification of the host's platform class. This refers to one  of
       the specifications contained in the TCG web site. The default is PC specification version 1.2 .

       <b>all_platform_classes</b>  Specifies  all  the  TCG  defined  platforms associated with the host platform. The
       host_platform_class must not be defined here. By  default,  all  platforms  but  the  host  platform  are
       associated.
