</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       taskrc - Configuration details for the <a href="../man1/task.1.html">task</a>(1) command

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$HOME/.taskrc</b>
       <b>task</b> <b>rc:&lt;directory-path&gt;/.taskrc</b> <b>...</b>
       <b>TASKRC=&lt;directory-path&gt;/.taskrc</b> <b>task</b> <b>...</b>
       <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME=&lt;directory-path&gt;/task/taskrc</b> <b>task</b> <b>...</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Taskwarrior</b>  obtains its configuration data from a file called <u>.taskrc</u> . This file is normally located in
       the user's home directory:

              $HOME/.taskrc

       The default location can be overridden using the <u>rc:</u> attribute when running task:

              $ task rc:&lt;directory-path&gt;/.taskrc ...

       or using the TASKRC environment variable:

              $ TASKRC=/tmp/.taskrc task ...

       Additionally, if no <a href="file:~/.taskrc">~/.taskrc</a> exists, taskwarrior will check if the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment  variable
       is defined:

              $ XDG_CONFIG_HOME=<a href="file:~/.config">~/.config</a> task ...

       Individual options can be overridden by using the <u>rc.&lt;name&gt;:</u> attribute when running task:

              $ task rc.&lt;name&gt;:&lt;value&gt; ...

       or

              $ task rc.&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt; ...

       If  <b>Taskwarrior</b>  is run without an existing configuration file it will ask if it should create a default,
       sample <u>.taskrc</u> file in the user's home directory.

       The .taskrc file follows a very simple syntax defining name/value pairs:

              &lt;name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;

       There may be whitespace around &lt;name&gt;, '=' and &lt;value&gt;, and it is ignored.  Whitespace within the &lt;value&gt;
       is left intact.  Whitespace is not permitted in comma-separated lists.  The entry must  be  on  a  single
       line, no continuations.  Values support UTF8 as well as JSON encoding, such as \uNNNN.

       Note  that  Taskwarrior  is flexible about the values used to represent Boolean items. You can use "1" to
       enable, anything else is interpreted as disabled.  The values "on", "yes", "y" and "true"  are  currently
       supported but deprecated.

              include &lt;file&gt;

       There  may  be  whitespace around 'include' and &lt;file&gt;. The file may be an absolute or relative path, and
       the special character '~' is expanded to mean $HOME. If relative  path  is  specified,  the  it  will  be
       evaluated  as  relative with respect to the following directories (listed in order of precedence): 1. the
       current working directory 2. the directory containing the taskrc file  3.  the  directories  set  by  the
       package manager (which usually contain
          pre-defined themes)

       Note that environment variables are also expanded in paths (and any other taskrc variables).

              # &lt;comment&gt;

       A comment consists of the character '#', and extends from the '#' to the end of the line. There is no way
       to comment a multi-line block. There may be blank lines.

       Almost  every  value  has  a  default  setting,  and an empty .taskrc file is one that makes use of every
       default. The contents of the .taskrc file therefore represent overrides of the default values. To  remove
       a default value completely there must be an entry like this:

              &lt;name&gt; =

       This entry overrides the default value with a blank value.

</pre><h4><b>EDITING</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  edit your .taskrc file by hand if you wish, or you can use the 'config' command. To permanently
       set a value in your .taskrc file, use this command:

              $ task config nag "You have more urgent tasks."

       To delete an entry, use this command:

              $ task config nag

       Taskwarrior will then use the default value. To explicitly set a value  to  blank,  and  therefore  avoid
       using the default value, use this command:

              $ task config nag ""

       Taskwarrior will also display all your settings with this command:

              $ task show

       and  in  addition,  will  also  perform a check of all the values in the file, warning you of anything it
       finds amiss.

</pre><h4><b>NESTING</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The .taskrc can include other files containing configuration settings by using the <b>include</b> statement:

              include &lt;path/to/the/configuration/file/to/be/included&gt;

       By using include files you can divide your main configuration file into several ones containing just  the
       relevant configuration data like colors, etc.

       There are two excellent uses of includes in your .taskrc, shown here:

              include holidays.en-US.rc
              include dark-16.theme

       This  includes  two  standard  files  that  are  distributed  with  Taskwarrior, which define a set of US
       holidays, and set up a 16-color theme to use, to color the reports and calendar.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       These environment variables override defaults, but not command-line arguments.

       <b>TASKDATA=<a href="file:~/.task">~/.task</a></b>
              This overrides the default path for the Taskwarrior data files.

       <b>TASKRC=<a href="file:~/.taskrc">~/.taskrc</a></b>
              This overrides the default RC file.

       This environment variable will be checked if <u><a href="file:~/.taskrc">~/.taskrc</a></u> doesn't exist

       <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME=<a href="file:~/.config">~/.config</a></b>
              If set, taskwarrior will look for a <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/task/taskrc</u> file

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Valid variable names and their default values are:

   <b>FILES</b>
       <b>data.location=$HOME/.task</b>
              This is a path to the directory containing all the Taskwarrior files. By default, it is set up  to
              be <a href="file:~/.task">~/.task</a>, for example: /home/paul/.task

              Note that you can use the <b>~</b> shell meta character, which will be properly expanded.

              Note that the TASKDATA environment variable overrides this setting.

       <b>hooks.location=$HOME/.task/hooks</b>
              This is a path to the hook scripts directory. By default it is <a href="file:~/.task/hooks.">~/.task/hooks.</a>

       <b>locking=1</b>
              Determines  whether  to use file locking when accessing the pending.data and completed.data files.
              Defaults to "1". Solaris users who store the data files on an NFS mount may need to set locking to
              "0". Note that there is danger in setting this value to "0" - another program (or another instance
              of task) may write to the task.pending file at the same time.

       <b>gc=1</b>   Can be used to temporarily suspend garbage collection (gc), so that task IDs  don't  change.  Note
              that  this  should  be  used  in  the  form of a command line override (task rc.gc=0 ...), and not
              permanently used in the .taskrc file, as this significantly affects performance in the long term.

       <b>hooks=1</b>
              This master control switch enables hook script processing. The default value is '1',  but  certain
              extensions and environments may need to disable hooks.

       <b>exit.on.missing.db=0</b>
              When  set  to  '1'  causes  the  program  to  exit if the database (<a href="file:~/.task">~/.task</a> or rc.data.location or
              TASKDATA override) is missing. Default value is '0'.

   <b>TERMINAL</b>
       <b>detection=1</b>
              Determines whether to use ioctl to establish the size of  the  window  you  are  using,  for  text
              wrapping.

       <b>defaultwidth=80</b>
              The  width  of output used when auto-detection support is not available. Defaults to 80. If set to
              0, it is interpreted as infinite width, therefore with  no  word-wrapping;  this  is  useful  when
              redirecting report output to a file for subsequent handling.

       <b>defaultheight=24</b>
              The  height of output used when auto-detection support is not available. Defaults to 24. If set to
              0, it is interpreted as infinite height. This is useful when redirecting  charts  to  a  file  for
              subsequent handling.

       <b>avoidlastcolumn=0</b>
              Causes the width of the terminal minus one to be used as the full width. This avoids placing color
              codes in the last column which can cause problems for Cygwin users. Default value is '0'.

       <b>hyphenate=1</b>
              Hyphenates lines when wrapping breaks occur mid-word. Default value is '1'.

       <b>editor=editor</b>
              Specifies  which  text  editor  you  wish  to  use  for  when  the <b>task</b> <b>edit</b> <b>&lt;ID&gt;</b> command is used.
              Taskwarrior will first look for this configuration variable. If found, it is  used.  Otherwise  it
              will look for the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables, before it defaults to using "editor".

       <b>reserved.lines=1</b>
              This  is  the  number  of lines reserved at the bottom of the screen for the shell prompt. This is
              only referenced when 'limit:page' is used.

   <b>MISCELLANEOUS</b>
       <b>verbose=1|0|nothing|list...</b>
              When set to "1" (the  default),  helpful  explanatory  comments  are  added  to  all  output  from
              Taskwarrior. Setting this to "0" means that you would see regular output.

              The  special  value  "nothing" can be used to eliminate all optional output, which results in only
              the formatted data being shown, with nothing else. This output is most readily parsed and used  by
              shell scripts.

              Alternatively,  you  can  specify a comma-separated list of verbosity tokens that control specific
              occasions when output is generated. This list may contain:

                  blank      Inserts extra blank lines in output, for clarity
                  header     Messages that appear before report output (this  includes  .taskrc/.task  overrides
              and the "[task next]" message)
                  footnote    Messages  that  appear  after  report  output  (mostly  status messages and change
              descriptions)
                  label      Column labels on tabular reports
                  new-id     Provides feedback on any new task with IDs (and UUIDs for new tasks with ID 0, such
              as new completed tasks).
                  new-uuid   Provides feedback on  any  new  task  with  UUIDs.  Overrides  new-id.  Useful  for
              automation.
                  affected   Reports 'N tasks affected' and similar
                  edit       Used the verbose template for the 'edit' command
                  special    Feedback when applying special tags
                  project    Feedback about project status changes
                  sync       Feedback about sync
                  filter     Shows the filter used in the command
                  context    Show the current context. Displayed in footnote.
                  override   Notification when configuration options are overridden
                  recur      Notification when a new recurring task instance is created
                  default    Notifications about taskwarrior choosing to perform a default action.

              The tokens "affected", "new-id", "new-uuid", "project", "override" and "recur" imply "footnote".

              The token "default" implies "header".

              Note  that  the  "1"  setting  is  equivalent to all the tokens being specified, and the "nothing"
              setting is equivalent to none of the tokens being specified.

              Here are the shortcut equivalents:

                  verbose=on
                  verbose=blank,header,footnote,label,new-id,affected,edit,special,project,sync,filter,override,
              recur

                  verbose=0
                  verbose=blank,label,new-id,edit

                  verbose=nothing
                  verbose=

              Those additional comments are sent to the standard error for header,  footnote  and  project.  The
              others are sent to standard output.

       <b>confirmation=1</b>
              May  be "1" or "0", and determines whether Taskwarrior will ask for confirmation before deleting a
              task or performing the undo command. The default value is "1". Consider leaving this enabled,  for
              safety.

       <b>allow.empty.filter=1</b>
              An empty filter combined with a write command is potentially a way to modify all tasks by mistake,
              and  when this is detected, confirmation is required.  Setting this to '0' means that it is an er‐
              ror to use a write command with no filter.

       <b>indent.annotation=2</b>
              Controls the number of spaces to indent annotations when shown beneath the description field.  The
              default value is "2".

       <b>indent.report=0</b>
              Controls the indentation of the entire report output. Default is "0".

       <b>row.padding=0</b>
              Controls left and right padding around each row of the report output. Default is "0".

       <b>column.padding=0</b>
              Controls padding between columns of the report output. Default is "1".

       <b>bulk=3</b> Is  a  number, defaulting to 3. When this number or greater of tasks are modified in a single com‐
              mand, confirmation will be required, regardless of the value of <b>confirmation</b> variable. The special
              value bulk=0 is treated as an infinity.

              This is useful for preventing large-scale unintended changes.

       <b>nag=You</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>urgent</b> <b>tasks.</b>
              This may be a string of text, or blank.  It is used as a prompt when a task is started of complet‐
              ed, when there are other tasks with a higher urgency.  Default value is:  'You  have  more  urgent
              tasks'.  It is a gentle reminder that you are contradicting your own urgency settings.

       <b>list.all.projects=0</b>
              May  be  "1" or "0", and determines whether the 'projects' command lists all the project names you
              have used, or just the ones used in active tasks. The default value is "0".

       <b>summary.all.projects=0</b>
              If set to "1", shows all projects in the summary report, even if there are no pending tasks.   The
              default value is "0".

       <b>complete.all.tags=1</b>
              May  be  "1"  or "0", and determines whether the tab completion scripts consider all the tag names
              you have used, or just the ones used in active tasks. The default value is "0".

       <b>list.all.tags=1</b>
              May be "1" or "0", and determines whether the 'tags' command lists all  the  tag  names  you  have
              used, or just the ones used in active tasks. The default value is "0".

       <b>print.empty.columns=1</b>
              May  be "1" or "0", and determines whether columns with no data for any task are printed. Defaults
              to "0".

       <b>search.case.sensitive=1</b>
              May be "1" or "0", and determines whether keyword lookup and substitutions on the description  and
              annotations  are  done in a case sensitive way. Defaults to "1" on most platforms. Defaults to "0"
              on Cygwin due to older regex library problems with case-insensitivity.

       <b>regex=1</b>
              Controls whether regular expression support is enabled. The default value is "1".

       <b>xterm.title=1</b>
              Sets the xterm window title when reports are run. Defaults to "0".

       <b>expressions=infix|postfix</b>
              Sets a preference for infix expressions (1 + 2) or postfix expressions (1 2 +).  Defaults  to  in‐
              fix.

       <b>json.array=1</b>
              Determines  whether the export command encloses the JSON output in '[...]' and adds ',' after each
              exported task object to create a properly-formed JSON array.  With json.array=0, export writes raw
              JSON objects to STDOUT, one per line.  Defaults to "1".

       <b>_forcecolor=1</b>
              Taskwarrior shuts off color automatically when the output is not sent directly to a TTY. For exam‐
              ple, this command:

                     $ task list &gt; file

              will not use any color. To override this, use:

                     $ task rc._forcecolor=yes list &gt; file

       Defaults to "0".

       <b>active.indicator=*</b>
              The character or string to show in the start.active column. Defaults to *.

       <b>tag.indicator=+</b>
              The character or string to show in the tag.indicator column. Defaults to +.

       <b>dependency.indicator=D</b>
              The character or string to show in the depends.indicator column. Defaults to D.

       <b>uda.&lt;name&gt;.indicator=U</b>
              The character or string to show in the &lt;uda&gt;.indicator column. Defaults to U.

       <b>recurrence=1</b>
              Controls whether recurrence is enabled, and whether recurring tasks continue to generate new  task
              instances. Defaults to "1".

              If you are syncing multiple clients, then it is advised that you set 'recurrence=1' on your prima‐
              ry client, and 'recurrence=0' on ALL other clients. This is a workaround for a duplication bug.

       <b>recurrence.confirmation=prompt</b>
              Controls  whether  changes to recurring tasks propagates to other child tasks with or without con‐
              firmation. A value of 'yes' means propagate changes without confirmation. A value of 'no' means do
              not propagate changes and don't ask for confirmation. A value of 'prompt' prompts you every  time.
              Defaults to 'prompt'.

       <b>recurrence.indicator=R</b>
              The character or string to show in the recurrence_indicator column. Defaults to R.

       <b>recurrence.limit=1</b>
              The  number  of  future recurring tasks to show. Defaults to 1. For example, if a weekly recurring
              task is added with a due date of tomorrow, and recurrence.limit is set to 2, then  a  report  will
              list 2 pending recurring tasks, one for tomorrow, and one for a week from tomorrow.

       <b>undo.style=side</b>
              When  the  'undo'  command is run, Taskwarrior presents a before and after comparison of the data.
              This can be in either the 'side' style, which compares values side-by-side in a table,  or  'diff'
              style, which uses a format similar to the 'diff' command.

       <b>abbreviation.minimum=2</b>
              Minimum  length  of  any  abbreviated command/value. This means that "ve", "ver", "vers", "versi",
              "versio" will all equate to "version", but "v" will not.  Default is 2.

       <b>debug=0</b>
              Taskwarrior has a debug mode that causes diagnostic output to be displayed.  Typically this is not
              something anyone would want, but when reporting a bug, debug output can be  useful.  It  can  also
              help  explain how the command line is being parsed, but the information is displayed in a develop‐
              er-friendly, not a user-friendly way.

              Turning debug on automatically sets debug.hooks=1, debug.parser=1 and debug.tls=2 if they  do  not
              already have assigned values. Defaults to "0".

       <b>debug.hooks=0</b>
              Controls  the  hook  system  diagnostic  level.  Level 0 means no diagnostics.  Level 1 shows hook
              calls. Level 2 also shows exit status and I/O.

       <b>debug.parser=0</b>
              Controls the parser diagnostic level. Level 0 shows no diagnostics.  Level 1 shows the final parse
              tree.  Level 2 shows the parse tree from all phases of the parse.  Level 3 shows expression evalu‐
              ation details.

       <b>debug.tls=0</b>
              Controls the GnuTLS diagnostic level. For 'sync' debugging. Level 0 means no diagnostics. Level  9
              is the highest. Level 2 is a good setting for debugging.

       <b>obfuscate=0</b>
              When  set to '1', will replace all report text with 'xxx'.  This is useful for sharing report out‐
              put in bug reports.  Default value is '0'.

       <b>alias.rm=delete</b>
              Taskwarrior supports command aliases. This alias provides an alternate name (rm)  for  the  delete
              command.  You can use aliases to provide alternate names for any of the commands. Several commands
              you may use are actually aliases - the 'history' report, for example, or 'export'.

       <b>burndown.cumulative=1</b>
              May be "1" or "0", and controls the behaviour of the burndown command. When set to 1, it  sums  up
              all completed tasks, otherwise they only get plotted in the interval where the task was completed.
              Defaults to 1.

   <b>DATES</b>
       <b>dateformat=Y-M-D</b>

       <b>dateformat.report=</b>

       <b>dateformat.holiday=YMD</b>

       <b>dateformat.edit=Y-M-D</b> <b>H:N:S</b>

       <b>dateformat.info=Y-M-D</b> <b>H:N:S</b>

       <b>dateformat.annotation=</b>

       <b>report.X.dateformat=Y-M-D</b>
              This  is  a string of characters that defines how Taskwarrior formats date values.  The precedence
              order for the configuration variable is report.X.dateformat then dateformat.report then dateformat
              for formatting the due dates in reports.  If both report.X.dateformat  and  dateformat.report  are
              not  set then dateformat will be applied to the date. Entered dates as well as all other displayed
              dates in reports are formatted according to dateformat.

              The default value is the ISO-8601 standard: Y-M-D. The string can contain the characters:

                     m  minimal-digit month,    for example 1 or 12
                     d  minimal-digit day,      for example 1 or 30
                     y  two-digit year,         for example 09 or 12
                     D  two-digit day,          for example 01 or 30
                     M  two-digit month,        for example 01 or 12
                     Y  four-digit year,        for example 2009 or 2015
                     a  short name of weekday,  for example Mon or Wed
                     A  long name of weekday,   for example Monday or Wednesday
                     b  short name of month,    for example Jan or Aug
                     B  long name of month,     for example January or August
                     v  minimal-digit week,     for example 3 or 37
                     V  two-digit week,         for example 03 or 37
                     h  minimal-digit hour,     for example 3 or 21
                     n  minimal-digit minutes,  for example 5 or 42
                     s  minimal-digit seconds,  for example 7 or 47
                     H  two-digit hour,         for example 03 or 21
                     N  two-digit minutes,      for example 05 or 42
                     S  two-digit seconds,      for example 07 or 47
                     J  three-digit Julian day, for example 023 or 365
                     j  Julian day,             for example 23 or 365
                     w  Week day,               for example 0 for Monday, 5 for Friday

              The characters 'v', 'V', 'a' and 'A' can only be used for formatting printed dates (not  to  parse
              them).

              The string may also contain other characters to act as spacers, or formatting.  Examples for other
              values of dateformat:

                     d/m/Y  would use for input and output 24/7/2009
                     yMD    would use for input and output 090724
                     M-D-Y  would use for input and output 07-24-2009

              Examples for other values of dateformat.report:

                     a D b Y (V)   would emit "Fri 24 Jul 2009 (30)"
                     A, B D, Y     would emit "Friday, July 24, 2009"
                     wV a Y-M-D    would emit "w30 Fri 2009-07-24"
                     yMD.HN        would emit "110124.2342"
                     m/d/Y H:N     would emit "1/24/2011 10:42"
                     a D b Y H:N:S would emit "Mon 24 Jan 2011 11:19:42"

              Undefined  fields  are put to their minimal valid values (1 for month and day and 0 for hour, min‐
              utes and seconds) when there is at least one more global date field that is set.  Otherwise,  they
              are set to the corresponding values of "now". For example:

                     8/1/2013  with m/d/Y   implies August 1, 2013 at midnight (inferred)
                     8/1 20:40 with m/d H:N implies August 1, 2013 (inferred) at 20:40

       <b>date.iso=1</b>
              Enables ISO-8601 date support.  The default value is "1".

   <b>CALENDAR</b>
       <b>weekstart=Sunday</b>
              Determines  the  day  a  week starts. Valid values are Sunday or Monday only. The default value is
              "Sunday".

       <b>displayweeknumber=1</b>
              Determines if week numbers are displayed when using the "task calendar" command.  The week  number
              is dependent on the day a week starts. The default value is "1".

       <b>due=7</b>  This  is the number of days into the future that define when a task is considered due, and is col‐
              ored accordingly. The default value is 7.

       <b>calendar.details=sparse</b>
              If set to "full" running "task calendar" will display the details of tasks  with  due  dates  that
              fall  into the calendar period. The corresponding days will be color-coded in the calendar. If set
              to "sparse" only the corresponding days will be color coded and no details will be displayed.  The
              displaying  of due dates with details is turned off by setting the variable to "none". The default
              value is "sparse".

       <b>calendar.details.report=list</b>
              The report to run when displaying the details of tasks with due dates when running the "task  cal‐
              endar" command. The default value is "list".

       <b>calendar.offset=0</b>
              If "1" the first month in the calendar report is effectively changed by the offset value specified
              in calendar.offset.value. It defaults to "0".

       <b>calendar.offset.value=-1</b>
              The offset value to apply to the first month in the calendar report. The default value is "-1".

       <b>calendar.holidays=none</b>
              If  set  to full running "task calendar" will display holidays in the calendar by color-coding the
              corresponding days. A detailed list with the dates and names of the holidays is also shown. If set
              to sparse only the days are color-coded and no details on the holidays will be displayed. The dis‐
              playing of holidays is turned off by setting the variable to none. The default value is "none".

       <b>calendar.legend=1</b>
              Determines whether the calendar legend is displayed. The default value is "1".

       <b>calendar.monthsperline=N</b>
              Determines how many months the "task calendar" command renders across the screen. Defaults to how‐
              ever many will fit. If more months than will fit are specified, Taskwarrior will only show as many
              that will fit.

   <b>JOURNAL</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       <b>journal.time=0</b>
              May be "1" or "0", and determines whether the 'start' and 'stop' commands should record an annota‐
              tion when being executed. The default value is "0". The text of the corresponding  annotations  is
              controlled by:

       <b>journal.time.start.annotation=Started</b> <b>task</b>
              The  text of the annotation that is recorded when executing the start command and having set jour‐
              nal.time.

       <b>journal.time.stop.annotation=Stopped</b> <b>task</b>
              The text of the annotation that is recorded when executing the stop command and having  set  jour‐
              nal.time.

       <b>journal.info=1</b>
              When enabled, this setting causes a change log of each task to be displayed by the 'info' command.
              Default value is "1".

   <b>HOLIDAYS</b>
       Holidays  are  entered  either  directly  in the .taskrc file or via an include file that is specified in
       .taskrc. For single-day holidays the name and the date is required to be given:

                     holiday.towel.name=Day of the towel
                     holiday.towel.date=20100525

       For holidays that span a range of days (i.e. vacation), you can use a start date and an end date:

                     holiday.sysadmin.name=System Administrator Appreciation Week
                     holiday.sysadmin.start=20100730
                     holiday.sysadmin.end=20100805

              Dates are to be entered according to the setting in the dateformat.holiday variable.

              The following holidays are computed automatically:  Good  Friday  (goodfriday),  Easter  (easter),
              Easter  Monday  (eastermonday),  Ascension  (ascension), Pentecost (pentecost). The date for these
              holidays is the given keyword:

                     holiday.eastersunday.name=Easter
                     holiday.eastersunday.date=easter

       Note that the Taskwarrior distribution contains example holiday files that can be included like this:

                     include holidays.en-US.rc

   <b>DEPENDENCIES</b>
       <b>dependency.reminder=1</b>
              Determines whether dependency chain violations generate reminders.

       <b>dependency.confirmation=1</b>
              Determines whether dependency chain repair requires confirmation.

   <b>COLOR</b> <b>CONTROLS</b>
       <b>color=1</b>
              May be "1" or "0". Determines whether Taskwarrior uses color. When "0", will use dashes (-----) to
              underline column headings.

       <b>fontunderline=1</b>
              Determines if font underlines or ASCII dashes should be used to underline headers, even when color
              is enabled.

       Taskwarrior has a number of coloration rules. They correspond to a particular attribute of a  task,  such
       as it being due, or being active, and specifies the automatic coloring of that task. A list of valid col‐
       ors, depending on your terminal, can be obtained by running the command:

              <b>task</b> <b>colors</b>

              Note  that  no  default values are listed here - the defaults now correspond to the dark-256.theme
              (Linux) and dark-16.theme (other) theme values.  The coloration rules are as follows:

              <b>color.due.today</b> Task is due today
              <b>color.active</b> Task is started, therefore active.
              <b>color.scheduled</b> Task is scheduled, therefore ready for work.
              <b>color.until</b> Task has an expiration date.
              <b>color.blocking</b> Task is blocking another in a dependency.
              <b>color.blocked</b> Task is blocked by a dependency.
              <b>color.overdue</b> Task is overdue (due some time prior to now).
              <b>color.due</b> Task is coming due.
              <b>color.project.none</b> Task does not have an assigned project.
              <b>color.tag.none</b> Task has no tags.
              <b>color.tagged</b> Task has at least one tag.
              <b>color.recurring</b> Task is recurring.
              <b>color.completed</b> Task is completed.
              <b>color.deleted</b> Task is deleted.

              To disable a coloration rule for which there is a default, set the value to nothing, for example:
                     <b>color.tagged=</b>

              By default, colors produced by rules blend. This has the advantage of conveying additional  infor‐
              mation, by producing combinations that are not used by any particular rule directly.

              However,  color blending can produce highlighting combinations which are not desired. In such cas‐
              es, use the following option to disable this behaviour:

       <b>rule.color.merge=1</b>
              Can be "1" or "0". When "0", disables merging of colors produced by different color rules. Use  if
              your color scheme produces unpleasing foreground and background combinations.

              See the <a href="../man5/task-color.5.html">task-color</a>(5) man pages for color details.

       Certain attributes like tags, projects and keywords can have their own coloration rules.

       <b>color.tag.X=yellow</b>
              Colors any task that has the tag X.

       <b>color.project.X=on</b> <b>green</b>
              Colors any task assigned to project X.

       <b>color.keyword.X=on</b> <b>blue</b>
              Colors any task where the description or any annotation contains X.

       <b>color.uda.X=on</b> <b>green</b>
              Colors any task that has the user defined attribute X.

       <b>color.uda.X.VALUE=on</b> <b>green</b>
              Colors any task that has the user defined attribute X set to VALUE.

       <b>color.uda.X.none=on</b> <b>green</b>
              Colors any task that does not have the user defined attribute X.

       <b>color.error=white</b> <b>on</b> <b>red</b>
              Colors any of the error messages.

       <b>color.warning=bold</b> <b>red</b>
              Colors any of the warning messages.

       <b>color.header=green</b>
              Colors any of the messages printed prior to the report output.

       <b>color.footnote=green</b>
              Colors any of the messages printed last.

       <b>color.summary.bar=on</b> <b>green</b>
              Colors the summary progress bar. Should consist of a background color.

       <b>color.summary.background=on</b> <b>black</b>
              Colors the summary progress bar. Should consist of a background color.

       <b>color.calendar.today=black</b> <b>on</b> <b>cyan</b>
              Color of today in calendar.

       <b>color.calendar.due=black</b> <b>on</b> <b>green</b>
              Color of days with due tasks in calendar.

       <b>color.calendar.due.today=black</b> <b>on</b> <b>magenta</b>
              Color of today with due tasks in calendar.

       <b>color.calendar.overdue=black</b> <b>on</b> <b>red</b>
              Color of days with overdue tasks in calendar.

       <b>color.calendar.scheduled=black</b> <b>on</b> <b>orange</b>
              Color of days with scheduled tasks in calendar.

       <b>color.calendar.weekend=bright</b> <b>white</b> <b>on</b> <b>black</b>

              Colors the report labels for sort columns. Defaults to color.label.

       <b>color.alternate=on</b> <b>rgb253</b>
              Color  of  alternate  tasks.   This  is to apply a specific color to every other task in a report,
              which can make it easier to visually separate tasks. This is especially useful when tasks are dis‐
              played over multiple lines due to long descriptions or annotations.

       <b>color.history.add=on</b> <b>red</b>
       <b>color.history.done=on</b> <b>green</b>
       <b>color.history.delete=on</b> <b>yellow</b>
              Colors the bars on the ghistory report graphs. Defaults to red, green and yellow bars.

              be reverted.

       <b>color.sync.added=green</b>
       <b>color.sync.changed=yellow</b>
       <b>color.sync.rejected=red</b>
              Colors the output of the sync command.

              <b>scheduled,keyword.,project.,tag.,uda.,recurring,</b> <b>tagged,completed,deleted</b>
              This  setting  specifies  the precedence of the color rules, from highest to lowest. Note that the
              prefix 'color.' is omitted (for brevity), and that any wildcard value (color.tag.XXX) is shortened
              to 'tag.', which places all specific tag rules at the same precedence, again for brevity.

       <b>color.debug=green</b>
              Colors all debug output, if enabled.

   <b>URGENCY</b>
       The urgency calculation uses a polynomial with several terms, each of which has  a  configurable  coeffi‐
       cient. Those coefficients are:

       <b>urgency.blocking.coefficient=8.0</b>
              Urgency coefficient for blocking tasks
       <b>urgency.blocked.coefficient=-5.0</b>
              Urgency coefficient for blocked tasks
       <b>urgency.due.coefficient=12.0</b>
              Urgency coefficient for due dates
       <b>urgency.waiting.coefficient=-3.0</b>
              Urgency coefficient for waiting status
       <b>urgency.active.coefficient=4.0</b>
              Urgency coefficient for active tasks
       <b>urgency.scheduled.coefficient=5.0</b>
              Urgency coefficient for scheduled tasks
       <b>urgency.project.coefficient=1.0</b>
              Urgency coefficient for projects
       <b>urgency.tags.coefficient=1.0</b>
              Urgency coefficient for tags
       <b>urgency.annotations.coefficient=1.0</b>
              Urgency coefficient for annotations
       <b>urgency.age.coefficient=2.0</b>
              Urgency coefficient for the age of tasks
       <b>urgency.age.max=365</b>
              Maximum  age  in days. After this number of days has elapsed, the urgency of a task won't increase
              any more because of aging.
       <b>urgency.user.tag.&lt;tag&gt;.coefficient=...</b>
              Specific tag coefficient.
       <b>urgency.user.tag.next.coefficient=15.0</b>
              Urgency coefficient for tag 'next'.
       <b>urgency.user.project.&lt;project&gt;.coefficient=...</b>
              Specific project coefficient.
       <b>urgency.user.keyword.&lt;keyword&gt;.coefficient=...</b>
              Specific description keyword coefficient.
       <b>urgency.uda.&lt;name&gt;.coefficient=...</b>
              Presence/absence of UDA data.
       <b>urgency.uda.&lt;name&gt;.&lt;value&gt;.coefficient=...</b>
              Specific value of UDA data.

       The coefficients reflect the relative importance of the various terms in the urgency  calculation.  These
       are  default values, and may be modified to suit your preferences, but it is important that you carefully
       consider any modifications.

       <b>urgency.inherit=0</b>
              Not actually a coefficient. When enabled, blocking tasks inherit the highest urgency  value  found
              in  the tasks they block. This is done recursively.  It is recommended to set urgency.blocking.co‐
              efficient and urgency.blocked.coefficient to 0.0 in order for this setting to be the most useful.

   <b>DEFAULTS</b>
       <b>default.project=foo</b>
              Provides a default project name for the <u>task</u> <u>add</u> command, if you don't specify one. The default is
              blank.

       <b>default.due=...</b>
              Provides a default due date for the <u>task</u> <u>add</u> command, if you don't specify  one.  You  can  use  a
              date, or a duration value which is assumed to be relative to 'now'. The default is blank.

       <b>default.scheduled=...</b>
              Provides  a default scheduled date for the <u>task</u> <u>add</u> command, if you don't specify one. You can use
              a date, or a duration value which is assumed to be relative to 'now'. The default is blank.

       <b>uda.&lt;name&gt;.default=...</b>
              Provides default values for UDA fields when using the <u>task</u> <u>add</u> command, if you don't specify  val‐
              ues. The default is blank.

       <b>default.command=next</b>
              Provides  a  default  command that is run every time Taskwarrior is invoked with no arguments. For
              example, if set to:

                     default.command=project:foo list

              then Taskwarrior will run the "project:foo list" command if no command is  specified.  This  means
              that by merely typing

                     $ task
                     [task project:foo list]

                     ID Project Pri Description
                      1 foo     H   Design foo
                      2 foo         Build foo

   <b>REPORTS</b>
       The  reports can be customized by using the following configuration variables.  The output columns, their
       labels and the sort order can be set using the corresponding variables for each report. Each report  name
       is used as a "command" name. For example

       <b>task</b> <b>overdue</b>

       <b>report.X.description</b>
              The description for report X when running the "task help" command.

       <b>report.X.columns</b>
              This  is  a  comma-separated  list  of  columns  and  formatting specifiers. See the command 'task
              columns' for a full list of options and examples.

       <b>report.X.context</b>
              A boolean value representing whether the given report should respect (apply) the currently  active
              context. See CONTEXT section for details about context.  Defaults to 1.

       <b>report.X.labels</b>
              The labels for each column that will be used when generating report X. The labels are a comma sep‐
              arated list.

       <b>report.X.sort</b>
              The  sort  order  of the tasks in the generated report X. The sort order is specified by using the
              column ids post-fixed by a "+" for ascending sort order or a "-" for descending  sort  order.  The
              sort IDs are separated by commas.  For example:

                  report.list.sort=due+,priority-,start.active-,project+

              Additionally,  after  the  "+"  or  "-", there can be a solidus "/" which indicates that there are
              breaks after the column values change. For example:

                  report.minimal.sort=project+/,description+

              This sort order now specifies that there is a listing break between each project. A listing  break
              is simply a blank line, which provides a visual grouping.

              A  special sort value of "none" indicates that no sorting is required, and tasks will be presented
              in the order (if any) in which they are selected.

       <b>report.X.filter</b>
              This adds a filter to the report X so that only tasks matching the filter criteria  are  displayed
              in the generated report.

              There  is  a  special  case  for 'report.timesheet.filter', which may be specified even though the
              'timesheet' report is not very customizable.

       <b>report.X.dateformat</b>
              This adds a dateformat to the report X that will be used by the "due date" column. If  it  is  not
              set  then  dateformat.report  and dateformat will be used in this order. See the <b>DATES</b> section for
              details on the sequence placeholders.

       <b>report.X.annotations</b>
              This adds the possibility to control the output of annotations for a task in a report. Deprecated.
              Use the <b>description</b> column with a format (e.g., <b>description.count</b>) instead.

       Taskwarrior comes with a number of predefined reports, which are:

       <b>next</b>   Lists the most important tasks.

       <b>long</b>   Lists all pending tasks and all data, matching the specified criteria.

       <b>list</b>   Lists all tasks matching the specified criteria.

       <b>ls</b>     Short listing of all tasks matching the specified criteria.

       <b>minimal</b>
              Minimal listing of all tasks matching the specified criteria.

       <b>newest</b> Shows the newest tasks.

       <b>oldest</b> Shows the oldest tasks.

       <b>overdue</b>
              Lists overdue tasks matching the specified criteria.

       <b>active</b> Lists active tasks matching the specified criteria.

       <b>completed</b>
              Lists completed tasks matching the specified criteria.

       <b>recurring</b>
              Lists recurring tasks matching the specified criteria.

       <b>waiting</b>
              Lists all waiting tasks matching the specified criteria.

       <b>all</b>    Lists all tasks matching the specified criteria.

       <b>blocked</b>
              Lists all tasks that have dependencies.

   <b>USER</b> <b>DEFINED</b> <b>ATTRIBUTES</b>
       User defined attributes (UDAs) are an extension mechanism that allows you to define  new  attributes  for
       Taskwarrior to store and display. One such example is an 'estimate' attribute that could be used to store
       time estimates associated with a task. This 'estimate' attribute is not built in to Taskwarrior, but with
       a  few  simple configuration settings you can instruct Taskwarrior to store this item, and provide access
       to it for custom reports and filters.

       This allows you to augment Taskwarrior to accommodate your workflow, or bend the rules and  use  Taskwar‐
       rior to store and synch data that is not necessarily task-related.

       One  important  restriction  is that because this is an open system that allows the definition of any new
       attribute, Taskwarrior cannot understand the meaning of that attribute. So while Taskwarrior will  faith‐
       fully  store, modify, report, sort and filter your UDA, it does not understand anything about it. For ex‐
       ample if you define a UDA named 'estimate', Taskwarrior will not know that this value  is  weeks,  hours,
       minutes, money, or some other resource count.

       <b>uda.&lt;name&gt;.type=string|numeric|date|duration</b>
              Defines a UDA called '&lt;name&gt;', of the specified type.

       <b>uda.&lt;name&gt;.label=&lt;column</b> <b>heading&gt;</b>
              Provides a default report label for the UDA called '&lt;name&gt;'.

       <b>uda.&lt;name&gt;.values=A,B,C</b>
              For  type  'string'  UDAs only, this provides a comma-separated list of acceptable values. In this
              example, the '&lt;name&gt;' UDA may only contain values 'A', 'B', or 'C', but may also contain no value.

              Note that the order of the value is important, and denotes the sort order from  highest  ('A')  to
              lowest ('C').

              Note that a blank value is permitted.

       <b>uda.&lt;name&gt;.default=...</b>
              Provides a default value for the UDA called '&lt;name&gt;'.

       <b>Example</b> <b>'estimate'</b> <b>UDA</b>
              This example shows an 'estimate' UDA that stores specific values for the size of a task.  Note the
              blank value after 'trivial'.

              <b>uda.estimate.type=string</b>
              <b>uda.estimate.label=Size</b> <b>Estimate</b>
              <b>uda.estimate.values=huge,large,medium,small,trivial,</b>

              Note that the value are sorted

                  huge &gt; large &gt; medium &gt; small &gt; trivial &gt; ''

   <b>CONTEXT</b>
       Context setting is a mechanism which allows the user to set a permanent filter, thus avoiding the need to
       specify one filter repeatedly. More details on usage can be found in the <a href="../man1/task.1.html">task</a>(1) man page.

       The current context is stored in the .taskrc file, along with definitions for all user provided contexts.

       <b>context=&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Stores the value of the currently active context.

       <b>context.&lt;name&gt;.read=&lt;filter&gt;</b>
       <b>context.&lt;name&gt;.write=&lt;modifications&gt;</b>
              Stores  the  definition of the read or write context with the name &lt;name&gt;. Read context is the de‐
              fault filter applied when the context is active. The write context are the  default  modifications
              applied to newly added tasks when the context is active.

       <b>context.&lt;name&gt;.rc.&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              The  rc  type  allows to override any configuration parameter for the current context, e.g. if the
              default command for the context home should be changed to  home_report,  the  following  statement
              could be added:

              context.home.rc.default.command=home_report

   <b>SYNC</b>
       These configuration settings are used to connect and sync tasks with the task server.

       <b>taskd.server=&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</b>
              Specifies the hostname and port of the Taskserver. Hostname may be an IPv4 or IPv6 address, or do‐
              main. Port is an integer.

       <b>taskd.credentials=&lt;organization&gt;/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;key&gt;</b>
              User identification for the Taskserver, which includes a private key.

       <b>taskd.certificate=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Specifies the path to the client certificate used for identification with the Taskserver.

       <b>taskd.key=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Specifies the path to the client key used for encrypted communication with the Taskserver.

       <b>taskd.ca=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Specifies  the path to the CA certificate in the event that your Taskserver is using a self-signed
              certificate. Optional.

       <b>taskd.trust=strict|ignore</b> <b>hostname|allow</b> <b>all</b>
              This settings allows you to override the trust level when server certificates are validated.  With
              "allow  all",  the server certificate is trusted automatically. With "ignore hostname", the server
              certificate is verified but the hostname is ignored. With "strict", the server certificate is ver‐
              ified.  Default is "strict", which requires full validation.

       <b>taskd.ciphers=NORMAL</b>
              Override of the cipher selection. The set of ciphers used by TLS may be controlled by both  server
              and  client. There must be some overlap between client and server supported ciphers, or communica‐
              tion cannot occur.  Default is "NORMAL". See GnuTLS documentation for full details.
