       What follows is an alphabetical list of all the NCAR Graphics environment variables and what they mean.

       <b>NCARG_BIN</b>,  if  set, indicates where the NCAR Graphics binaries are installed.  This environment variable
       takes precedence over NCARG_ROOT and doesn't need to be set unless  you  want  to  override  the  default
       ($NCARG_ROOT/bin).

       <b>NCARG_CONFIG</b>,  if  set,  indicates  where  the NCAR Graphics configuration files are installed (these are
       needed by site installers only).  This environment variable takes precedence over NCARG_ROOT and  doesn't
       need to be set unless you want to override the default ($NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/config).

       <b>NCARG_DATA</b>, if set, indicates where the NCAR Graphics example data files are installed.  This environment
       variable  takes  precedence  over  NCARG_ROOT  and doesn't need to be set unless you want to override the
       default ($NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/data).
