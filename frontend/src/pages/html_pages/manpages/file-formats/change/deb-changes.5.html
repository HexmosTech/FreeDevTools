</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       deb-changes - Debian upload changes control file format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>filename</u><b>.changes</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Each Debian upload is composed of a .changes control file, which contains a number of fields in <b><a href="../man5/deb822.5.html">deb822</a></b>(5)
       format.

       Each field begins with a tag, such as <b>Source</b> or <b>Binary</b> (case insensitive), followed by a colon, and the
       body of the field (case sensitive unless stated otherwise).  Fields are delimited only by field tags.  In
       other words, field text may be multiple lines in length, but the installation tools will generally join
       lines when processing the body of the field (except in case of the multiline fields <b>Description</b>, <b>Changes</b>,
       <b>Files</b>, <b>Checksums-Sha1</b> and <b>Checksums-Sha256</b>, see below).

       The control data might be enclosed in an OpenPGP ASCII Armored signature, as specified in RFC9580.

</pre><h4><b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Format:</b> <u>format-version</u> (required)
           The  value of this field declares the format version of the file.  The syntax of the field value is a
           version number with a major and minor component.  Backward incompatible changes to  the  format  will
           bump the major version, and backward compatible changes (such as field additions) will bump the minor
           version.  The current format version is <b>1.8</b>.

       <b>Date:</b> <u>release-date</u> (required)
           The  date  the  package  was  built  or  last edited.  It must be in the same format as the date in a
           <b><a href="../man5/deb-changelog.5.html">deb-changelog</a></b>(5) entry.

           The value of this field is usually extracted from the <u>debian/changelog</u> file.

       <b>Source:</b> <u>source-name</u> [<b>(</b><u>source-version</u><b>)</b>] (required)
           The name of the source package.  If the source version differs from  the  binary  version,  then  the
           <u>source-name</u>  will be followed by a <u>source-version</u> in parenthesis.  This can happen when the upload is
           a binary-only non-maintainer upload.

       <b>Binary:</b> <u>binary-package-list</u> (required in context)
           This folded field is a space-separated list of binary packages to upload.  If the upload  is  source-
           only, then the field is omitted (since dpkg 1.19.3).

       <b>Architecture:</b> <u>arch-list</u>
           Lists  the  architectures  of  the  files  currently being uploaded.  Common architectures are <b>amd64</b>,
           <b>armel</b>, <b>i386</b>, etc.  Note that the <b>all</b> value is meant for packages that are  architecture  independent.
           If  the  source  for  the  package  is also being uploaded, the special entry <b>source</b> is also present.
           Architecture wildcards must never be present in the list.

       <b>Version:</b> <u>version-string</u> (required)
           Typically, this is the original package's version number in whatever form the program's author  uses.
           It may also include a Debian revision number (for non-native packages).  The exact format and sorting
           algorithm are described in <b><a href="../man7/deb-version.7.html">deb-version</a></b>(7).

       <b>Distribution:</b> <u>distribution</u>s (required)
           Lists  one  or  more  space-separated distributions where this version should be installed when it is
           uploaded to the archive.

       <b>Urgency:</b> <u>urgency</u> (recommended)
           The urgency of the upload.  The currently known values, in increasing order  of  urgency,  are:  <b>low</b>,
           <b>medium</b>, <b>high</b>, <b>critical</b> and <b>emergency</b>.

       <b>Maintainer:</b> <u>fullname-email</u> (required)
           Should  be  in the format “Joe Bloggs &lt;<a href="mailto:jbloggs@example.org">jbloggs@example.org</a>&gt;”, and is typically the person who created
           the package, as opposed to the author of the software that was packaged.

       <b>Changed-By:</b> <u>fullname-email</u>
           Should be in the format “Joe Bloggs &lt;<a href="mailto:jbloggs@example.org">jbloggs@example.org</a>&gt;”, and is typically the person who  prepared
           the package changes for this release.

       <b>Description:</b> (recommended)
        <u>binary-package-name</u> <b>-</b> <u>binary-package-summary</u>
           This  multiline  field  contains a list of binary package names followed by a space, a dash (‘<b>-</b>’) and
           their possibly truncated short descriptions.  If the upload is source-only, then the field is omitted
           (since dpkg 1.19.3).

       <b>Closes:</b> <u>bug-number-list</u>
           A space-separated list of bug report numbers for bug  reports  that  have  been  resolved  with  this
           upload.   The  distribution archive software might use this field to automatically close the referred
           bug numbers in the distribution bug tracking system.

       <b>Binary-Only:</b> <b>yes</b>
           This field denotes that the upload is a binary-only non-maintainer build.   It  originates  from  the
           <b>binary-only=yes</b> key/value from the changelog metadata entry.

       <b>Built-For-Profiles:</b> <u>profile-list</u>
           This field specifies a whitespace separated list of build profiles that this upload was built with.

       <b>Changes:</b> (required)
        <u>changelog-entries</u>
           This  multiline  field  contains  the concatenated text of all changelog entries that are part of the
           upload.  To make this a valid multiline field empty lines are replaced with a single full stop  (‘.’)
           and  all  lines  are  indented  by  one  space character.  The exact content depends on the changelog
           format.

       <b>Files:</b> (required)
        <u>md5sum</u> <u>size</u> <u>section</u> <u>priority</u> <u>filename</u>
           This multiline field contains a list of files with an md5sum, size, section  and  priority  for  each
           one.

           The  first  line of the field value (the part on the same line as the field name followed by a colon)
           is always empty.  The content of the field is expressed as continuation lines,  one  line  per  file.
           Each  line  consists  of  space-separated entries describing the file: the md5sum, the file size, the
           file section, the file priority, and the file name.

           If the section or priority are omitted from the  package,  these  default  to  <b>unknown</b>  and  <b>optional</b>
           respectively (since dpkg 1.22.13).

           This  field  lists all files that make up the upload.  The list of files in this field must match the
           list of files in the other related <b>Checksums</b> fields.

           <b>Note</b>: The MD5 checksum is considered weak, and should never be assumed to be  sufficient  for  secure
           verification, but this field cannot be omitted as it provides metadata not available anywhere else.

       <b>Checksums-Sha1:</b> (required, weak)
       <b>Checksums-Sha256:</b> (required, strong)
        <u>checksum</u> <u>size</u> <u>filename</u>
           These  multiline  fields contain a list of files with a checksum and size for each one.  These fields
           have the same syntax and differ only in the checksum algorithm used:  SHA-1  for  <b>Checksums-Sha1</b>  and
           SHA-256 for <b>Checksums-Sha256</b>.

           The  first  line of the field value (the part on the same line as the field name followed by a colon)
           is always empty.  The content of the field is expressed as continuation lines,  one  line  per  file.
           Each  line  consists of space-separated entries describing the file: the checksum, the file size, and
           the file name.

           These fields list all files that make up the upload.  The list of files in these  fields  must  match
           the list of files in the <b>Files</b> field and the other related <b>Checksums</b> fields.

           <b>Note</b>:  The SHA-1 checksum is considered weak, and should never be assumed to be sufficient for secure
           verification.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Files</b> field is inconsistent with the other <b>Checksums</b> fields.  The <b>Changed-By</b>  and  <b>Maintainer</b>  fields
       have  confusing names.  The <b>Distribution</b> field contains information about what is commonly referred to as
       a suite.
