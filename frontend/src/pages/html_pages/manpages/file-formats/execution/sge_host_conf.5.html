</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       host_conf - Grid Engine execution host configuration file format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Host_conf</u> reflects the format of the template file for the execution host configuration.  Via the <b>-ae</b> and
       <b>-me</b>  options  of  the  <u><a href="../man1/qconf.1.html">qconf</a></u>(1)  command, you can add execution hosts and modify the configuration of any
       execution host in the cluster. Default execution host entries  are  added  automatically  as  soon  as  a
       <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8)  registers  to <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8) for the very first time from a certain host. The <u><a href="../man1/qconf.1.html">qconf</a></u>(1) <b>-sel</b>
       switch can be used to display a list of execution hosts currently configured in your Grid Engine  system.
       Via the <b>-se</b> option you can print the execution host configuration of a specified host.

       The special hostname "global" can be used to define cluster global characteristics.

       Note  Grid  Engine  allows  backslashes  (\)  be used to escape newline characters. The backslash and the
       newline are replaced with a space character before any interpretation.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The format of a <u>host_conf</u> file is defined as follows:

   <b>hostname</b>
       The execution host's name in the format for <u>host_name</u> in <u><a href="../man5/sge_types.5.html">sge_types</a></u>(5).

   <b>load_scaling</b>
       A comma-separated list of scaling values to be applied to each or part of the load values being  reported
       by  the  <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8)  on the host.  The load scaling factors are intended to level hardware or operating
       system-specific differences between execution hosts.

       The syntax of a load factor specification is as follows: First the name of the load value (as defined  in
       the  "host"  complex)  is  given  and, separated by an equal sign, the load scaling value is provided. No
       blanks are allowed in the load_scaling value string.

       The parameter <b>load_scaling</b> is not meaningful for the definition of the "global" host.

   <b>complex_values</b>
       <b>complex_values</b> defines quotas for resource attributes managed via this host. Each  complex  attribute  is
       followed  by  an  "="  sign  and  the  value specification compliant with the complex attribute type (see
       <u><a href="../man5/complex.5.html">complex</a></u>(5)).  Quota specifications are separated by commas.

       The quotas are related to the resource consumption of all jobs on  a  host  in  the  case  of  consumable
       resources (see <u><a href="../man5/complex.5.html">complex</a></u>(5) for details on consumable resources), or they are interpreted on a per-job slot
       basis in the case of non-consumable resources. Consumable resource attributes are commonly used to manage
       free  memory,  free  disk  space or available floating software licenses, while non-consumable attributes
       usually define distinctive characteristics like type of hardware installed.

       For consumable resource attributes, an available resource amount is determined by subtracting the current
       resource consumption of all running jobs on the host from the quota in the <b>complex_values</b> list. Jobs  can
       only  be  dispatched  to  a  host  if no resource requests exceed any corresponding resource availability
       obtained by this scheme. The quota definition in the <b>complex_values</b> list is automatically replaced by the
       current load value reported for this attribute, if load  is  monitored  for  this  resource  and  if  the
       reported  load  value  is  more  stringent  than  the  quota. This effectively avoids oversubscription of
       resources.

       <b>Note:</b> Load values replacing the quota specifications may have become more  stringent  because  they  have
       been scaled (see <b>load_scaling</b> above) and/or load adjusted (see <u><a href="../man5/sched_conf.5.html">sched_conf</a></u>(5)).  The <u>-F</u> option of <u><a href="../man1/qstat.1.html">qstat</a></u>(1)
       and the load display in the <u><a href="../man1/qmon.1.html">qmon</a></u>(1) queue control dialog (activated by clicking on a queue icon while the
       "Shift"  key  is pressed) provide detailed information on the actual availability of consumable resources
       and on the origin of the values taken into account currently.

       <b>Note</b> <b>also:</b> The resource consumption of running jobs (used for the availability calculation)  as  well  as
       the  resource  requests  of  the  jobs  waiting to be dispatched either may be derived from explicit user
       requests during job submission (see the <u>-l</u> option to <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1)) or from a "default" value configured for an
       attribute by the administrator (see <u><a href="../man5/complex.5.html">complex</a></u>(5)).  The <u>-r</u> option to <u><a href="../man1/qstat.1.html">qstat</a></u>(1) can be  used  for  retrieving
       full detail on the actual resource requests of all jobs in the system.

       For  non-consumable  resources  Grid  Engine  simply  compares  the  job's  attribute  requests  with the
       corresponding specification in <b>complex_values</b> taking the  relation  operator  of  the  complex  attribute
       definition  into  account  (see  <u><a href="../man5/complex.5.html">complex</a></u>(5)).   If  the  result  of the comparison is "true", the host is
       suitable for the job with respect to the particular attribute. For parallel jobs  each  job  slot  to  be
       occupied by a parallel task is meant to provide the same resource attribute value.

       <b>Note:</b>  Only  numeric  complex  attributes  can  be  defined as consumable resources and hence non-numeric
       attributes are always handled on a per job slot basis.

       The default value for this parameter is NONE, i.e. no administrator defined resource attribute quotas are
       associated with the host.

   <b>load_values</b>
       This entry cannot be configured but is only displayed in case of a <u><a href="../man1/qconf.1.html">qconf</a></u>(1) <b>-se</b> command. All load  values
       are displayed as reported by the <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) on the host. The load values are shown in a comma-separated
       list. Each load value starts with its name, followed by an equal sign and the reported value.

   <b>processors</b>
       <b>Note:</b> Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
       This entry cannot be configured but is only displayed in case of a <u><a href="../man1/qconf.1.html">qconf</a></u>(1) <b>-se</b> command. Its value is the
       number  of  "processors"  which  has  been  detected by <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) on the corresponding host.  This may
       include "hardware threads" reported by the operating system.

   <b>usage_scaling</b>
       The <b>usage_scaling</b> parameter  scales  the  usage  figures,  but  only  for  the  purposes  of  share  tree
       calculations, i.e. a scaling factor of 0 means that use of the relevant host(s) will be ignored for share
       tree purposes (e.g. if hosts are dedicated for a specific use).  The format is equivalent to <b>load_scaling</b>
       (see  above).   However, the only valid attributes to be scaled are <b>cpu</b> for CPU time consumption, <b>mem</b> for
       memory consumption aggregated over the lifetime of jobs and <b>io</b> for data transferred via any I/O  devices.
       The default NONE means "no scaling", i.e. all scaling factors are 1.

   <b>user_lists</b>
       The  <b>user_lists</b>  parameter contains a comma-separated list of so called user access lists as described in
       <u><a href="../man5/access_list.5.html">access_list</a></u>(5).  Each user contained in at least one of the listed access lists has access to  the  host.
       If  the <b>user_lists</b> parameter is set to NONE (the default), any user has access if not explicitly excluded
       via the <b>xuser_lists</b> parameter described below.  If a  user  is  contained  both  in  an  access  list  in
       <b>xuser_lists</b> and <b>user_lists</b> the user is denied access to the host.

   <b>xuser_lists</b>
       The  <b>xuser_lists</b> parameter contains a comma-separated list of so called user access lists as described in
       <u><a href="../man5/access_list.5.html">access_list</a></u>(5).  Each user contained in at least one of the access lists is not  allowed  to  access  the
       host.  If  the  <b>xuser_lists</b>  parameter  is  set to NONE (the default), any user has access.  If a user is
       contained both in <b>xuser_lists</b> and <b>user_lists</b>, the user is denied access to the host.

   <b>projects</b>
       The <b>projects</b> parameter contains a comma-separated list of projects that have  access  to  the  host.  Any
       projects  not  in  this list are denied access to the host. If set to NONE (the default), any project has
       access if not specifically excluded via the <b>xprojects</b> parameter described below. If a project is in  both
       <b>projects</b> and <b>xprojects</b>, the project is denied access to the host.

   <b>xprojects</b>
       The  <b>xprojects</b>  parameter contains a comma-separated list of projects that are denied access to the host.
       If set to NONE (the default), no projects are denied access other than those denied access based  on  the
       <b>projects</b>  parameter  described  above.   If  a  project is in both <b>projects</b> and <b>xprojects</b>, the project is
       denied access to the host.

   <b>report_variables</b>
       The <b>report_variables</b> parameter contains a comma-separated list of variables that should be written to the
       reporting file.  The variables listed here will be written to the  reporting  file  when  a  load  report
       arrives from an execution host.

       Default  settings  can  be  done  in  the  global  host. Host-specific settings for report_variables will
       override settings from the global host.
