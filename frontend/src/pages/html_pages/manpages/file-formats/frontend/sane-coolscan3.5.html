</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-coolscan3 - SANE backend for Nikon Coolscan film scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-coolscan3</b>  library  implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
       Nikon Coolscan film scanners.  Some functions of this backend should be considered <b>beta-quality</b> software.
       Most functions have been stable for a long time, but of course new  development  can  not  and  will  not
       function properly from the very first day.

       At present, the following scanners are known to work with this backend:

              Model:                       Connection Type
              ---------------------------  -------------------
              LS-30 (Coolscan III)         SCSI
              LS-40 ED (Coolscan IV)       USB
              LS-50 ED (Coolscan V)        USB
              LS-2000                      SCSI
              LS-4000 ED                   IEEE 1394
              LS-8000 ED                   IEEE 1394

       Please send mail to <u><a href="mailto:sane-devel@alioth-lists.debian.net">sane-devel@alioth-lists.debian.net</a></u> to report successes or failures.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  options  the  backend  supports can either be selected through command line options to programs like
       <b><a href="../man1/scanimage.1.html">scanimage</a></b>(1) or through GUI elements in <b><a href="../man1/xscanimage.1.html">xscanimage</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/xsane.1.html">xsane</a></b>(1).

       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using:

              scanimage --help -d coolscan3:&lt;interface&gt;:&lt;device&gt;

       where &lt;interface&gt; and &lt;device&gt; specify the device in question, as in the  configuration  file  (see  next
       section).  The  <b>-d</b>  parameter  and its argument can be omitted to obtain information on the first scanner
       identified. Use the command:

              scanimage -L

       to list all devices recognized by your SANE installation.

       The options should be fully described by the description  or  tooltips  given  by  frontend.  Here  is  a
       description  of  some  of  the  most important options, in the syntax with which they must be supplied to
       <b><a href="../man1/scanimage.1.html">scanimage</a></b>(1):

       <b>--frame</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              This option specifies which frame to operate on, if a motorized film strip feeder or  APS  adapter
              are  used.  The  frame number <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> ranges from 1 to the number of frames available, which is sensed
              each time the backend is initialized (usually each time you start the frontend).

       <b>--subframe</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              This option shifts the scan window by the specified amount (default unit is mm).

       <b>--infrared=yes/no</b>
              If set to "yes", the scanner will read the infrared  channel,  thus  allowing  defect  removal  in
              software.  The  infrared  image is read during a second scan, with no options altered. The backend
              must not be restarted between the scans.  If you use  <b><a href="../man1/scanimage.1.html">scanimage</a></b>(1),  perform  a  batch  scan  with
              <b>--batch-count=2</b> to obtain the IR information.

       <b>--depth</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Here  &lt;n&gt;  can either be 8 or the maximum number of bits supported by the scanner (10, 12, or 14).
              It specifies whether or not the scanner reduces the scanned data to 8 bits before  sending  it  to
              the  backend.  If 8 bits are used, some information and thus image quality is lost, but the amount
              of data is smaller compared to higher depths. Also, many imaging programs and image formats cannot
              handle depths greater than 8 bits.

       <b>--autofocus</b>
              Perform autofocus operation. Unless otherwise specified by the other options  (  <b>--focus-on-centre</b>
              and friends), focusing is performed on the centre of the selected scan area.

       <b>--ae-wb</b>

       <b>--ae</b>   Perform  a  pre-scan  to calculate exposure values automatically.  <b>--ae-wb</b> will maintain the white
              balance, while <b>--ae</b> will adjust each channel separately.

       <b>--exposure</b>
              Multiply all exposure times with this value. This allows  exposure  correction  without  modifying
              white balance.

       <b>--load</b> Load the next slide when using the slide loader (SF-200 bulk loader only).

       <b>--eject</b>
              Eject the film strip or mounted slide when using the slide loader.

       <b>--reset</b>
              Reset  scanner. The scanner will perform the same action as when power is turned on: it will eject
              the slide (with the SF-200 bulk loader) and  calibrate  itself.  Use  this  whenever  the  scanner
              refuses to load a slide properly, as a result of which <b>--eject</b> does not work.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration  file  <u>/etc/sane.d/coolscan3.conf</u>  specifies  the device(s) that the backend will use.
       Owing to the nature of the supported connection types SCSI, USB, and IEEE 1394, the default configuration
       file supplied with the SANE distribution should work without being edited.

       Each line in the configuration file is either of the following, where all entries are case-sensitive:

       <u>blank</u> <u>or</u> <u>starting</u> <u>with</u> <u>a</u> <u>'#'</u> <u>character</u>
              These lines are ignored, thus '#' can be used to include comments.

       <u>containing</u> <u>only</u> <u>the</u> <u>word</u> <u>"auto"</u>
              This instructs the backend to probe for a scanner by scanning the buses  for  devices  with  known
              identifiers. This is the default action when no configuration file is present.

       <u>a</u> <u>line</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>form</u> <u>&lt;interface&gt;:&lt;device&gt;</u>
              Here  &lt;interface&gt;  can  be one of "scsi" or "usb", and &lt;device&gt; is the device file of the scanner.
              Note that IEEE 1394 devices are handled by the SBP-2 module in the kernel and appear  to  SANE  as
              SCSI devices.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-coolscan3.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-coolscan3.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

       <u>/etc/sane.d/coolscan3.conf</u>
              Configuration file for this backend, read each time the backend is initialized.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_DEBUG_COOLSCAN3</b>
              If  the  library  was  compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128 requests  all  debug  output  to  be  printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5), <b><a href="../man5/sane-usb.5.html">sane-usb</a></b>(5), <b><a href="../man1/scanimage.1.html">scanimage</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/xscanimage.1.html">xscanimage</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/xsane.1.html">xsane</a></b>(1)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Currently, the SANE protocol does not allow automatically updating options whenever the hardware changes.
       Thus  the number of choices for the <b>--frame</b> option will be fixed when the backend is initialized (usually
       when the user runs the frontend). In particular, if there is no film strip in the  automatic  film  strip
       feeder  when the backend is initialized, the <b>--frame</b> option will not appear at all.  Also, restarting the
       frontend after swapping film adapters is strongly recommended.

       Linux kernels prior to 2.4.19 had a patch that truncated INQUIRY data  from  IEEE  1394  scanners  to  36
       bytes,  discarding  vital  information  about  the scanner. The IEEE 1394 models therefore only work with
       2.4.19 or later.

       No real bugs currently known, please report any to the SANE developers' list.
