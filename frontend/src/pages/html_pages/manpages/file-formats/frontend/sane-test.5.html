       sane-test - SANE backend for testing frontends

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-test</b>  library  implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that allows testing the SANE
       installation and SANE frontends.  It provides access to a (nearly) unlimited number of  virtual  devices.
       There  is  no  support for real scanners or cameras.  However, the backend simulates scanning and setting
       options.

       The idea is not only to find bugs in frontends but also to show  all  capabilities  of  SANE.   Therefore
       <b>sane-test</b> implements functions and options that are not (or seldom) found in other backends.

       The  backend is commented out in <u>/etc/sane.d/dll.conf</u>, so either the comment character must be removed or
       the backend must be called explicitly.  E.g.  <u>scanimage</u> <u>-d</u> <u>test</u> or <u>xscanimage</u> <u>test</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SCAN</b> <b>MODE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Option <b>mode</b> selects the scan mode (Gray or Color).

       Option <b>depth</b> determines the number of bits per sample (1. 8, or 16).   Keep  in  mind,  that  this  value
       refers  to  the  sample, not the pixel.  So depth=16 results in 48 bits per pixel in color mode. The most
       usual combinations are mode=Gray, depth=1 for  lineart,  mode=Gray,  depth=8  for  gray  and  mode=Color,
       depth=8  for color mode.  The combination of color and 1-bit mode is quite obscure (8 colors) but allowed
       in the SANE standard. However, the meaning of bits is not defined. Currently 1 = high intensity and  0  =
       low intensity is used.

       Setting  option  <b>hand-scanner</b> results in the test-backend behaving like a hand-scanner.  Hand-scanners do
       not know the image height a priori.  Instead, they return a height of -1.  Setting this option allows one
       to test whether a frontend can handle this correctly.  This option also enables a fixed width of 11 cm.

       Setting option <b>three-pass</b> simulates a three-pass scanner.  Older color scanners needed to scan the  image
       once  per  color (red/green/blue) to get the full image.  Therefore, in this mode three single frames are
       transmitted in color mode.

       Option <b>three-pass-order</b> provides support for changing the order of the three frames  (see  option  three-
       pass above).  A frontend should support all orders.

       Option <b>resolution</b> sets the resolution of the image in dots per inch.

       Option <b>source</b> can be used to simulate an Automatic Document Feeder (ADF). After 10 scans, the ADF will be
       "empty".

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Option <b>test-picture</b> allows one to set the image that's returned to the frontend.  While "Solid white" and
       "Solid  black"  are quite obvious, the other options need some more explanation.  Color patterns are used
       to determine if all modes and their colors are represented correctly by the frontend.   The  grid  should
       look  like  the  same  in  every  mode and resolution.  A table of all the test pictures can be found at:
       <u><a href="http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/test-backend/test-pictures.html">http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/test-backend/test-pictures.html</a></u>.

       If option <b>invert-endianness</b> is set, the upper and  lower  bytes  of  image  data  in  16  bit  modes  are
       exchanged.   This option can be used to test the 16 bit modes of frontends, e.g. if the frontend uses the
       correct endianness.

       If option <b>read-limit</b> is set, the maximum amount of data transferred with  each  call  to  <b>sane_read</b>()  is
       limited.

       Option <b>read-limit-size</b> sets the limit for option read-limit.  A low limit slows down scanning.  It can be
       used  to  detect  errors in frontend that occur because of wrong assumptions on the size of the buffer or
       timing problems.

       Option <b>read-delay</b> enables delaying data to the frontend.

       Option <b>read-delay-duration</b> selects the number of microseconds the backends waits after each transfer of a
       buffer.  This option is useful to find timing-related bugs, especially if used over the network.

       If option <b>read-return-value</b> is different from "Default", the selected status will be  returned  by  every
       call to <b>sane_read</b>().  This is useful to test the frontend's handling of the SANE statuses.

       If  option <b>ppl-loss</b> is different from 0, it determines the number of pixels that are "lost" at the end of
       each line.  That means, lines are padded with unused data.

       Option <b>fuzzy-parameters</b> selects that fuzzy (inexact) parameters are returned as long as the  scan  hasn't
       been  started.   This  option  can  be used to test if the frontend uses the parameters it got before the
       start of the scan (which it shouldn't).

       Option <b>non-blocking</b> determines if non-blocking IO for <b>sane_read</b>() should be  used  if  supported  by  the
       frontend.

       If  option <b>select-fd</b> is set, the backend offers a select filedescriptor for detecting if <b>sane_read()</b> will
       return data.

       If option <b>enable-test-options</b> is set, a fairly big list of options for testing the  various  SANE  option
       types is enabled.

       Option <b>print-options</b> can be used to print a list of all options to standard error.

</pre><h4><b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Option <b>tl-x</b> determines the top-left x position of the scan area.

       Option <b>tl-y</b> determines the top-left y position of the scan area.

       Option <b>br-x</b> determines the bottom-right x position of the scan area.

       Option <b>br-y</b> determines the bottom-right y position of the scan area.

</pre><h4><b>BOOL</b> <b>TEST</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  6  bool test options in total.  Each option is numbered.  (3/6) means: this is option 3 of 6.
       The numbering scheme is intended for easier detection of options not displayed by the  frontend  (because
       of missing support or bugs).

       Option <b>bool-soft-select-soft-detect</b> (1/6) is a bool test option that has soft select and soft detect (and
       advanced) capabilities.  That's just a normal bool option.

       Option <b>bool-hard-select-soft-detect</b> (2/6) is a bool test option that has hard select and soft detect (and
       advanced)  capabilities.   That  means  the  option can't be set by the frontend but by the user (e.g. by
       pressing a button at the device).

       Option <b>bool-hard-select</b> (3/6) is a bool test option that has hard  select  (and  advanced)  capabilities.
       That  means  the  option  can't  be set by the frontend but by the user (e.g. by pressing a button at the
       device) and can't be read by the frontend.

       Option <b>bool-soft-detect</b> (4/6) is a bool test option that has soft  detect  (and  advanced)  capabilities.
       That means the option is read-only.

       Option  <b>bool-soft-select-soft-detect-emulated</b>  (5/6)  is  a  Bool  test option that has soft select, soft
       detect, and emulated (and advanced) capabilities.

       Option <b>bool-soft-select-soft-detect-auto</b> (6/6) is a Bool test option that has soft select,  soft  detect,
       and automatic (and advanced) capabilities.  This option can be automatically set by the backend.

</pre><h4><b>INT</b> <b>TEST</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are 7 int test options in total.

       Option <b>int</b> (1/7) is an int test option with no unit and no constraint set.

       Option  <b>int-constraint-range</b>  (2/7)  is  an  int  test  option  with unit pixel and constraint range set.
       Minimum is 4, maximum 192, and quant is 2.

       Option <b>int-constraint-word-list</b> (3/7) is an int test option with unit bits and constraint word list set.

       Option <b>int-constraint-array</b> (4/7) is an int  test  option  with  unit  mm  and  using  an  array  without
       constraints.

       Option  <b>int-constraint-array-constraint-range</b> (5/7) is an int test option with unit mm and using an array
       with a range constraint.  Minimum is 4, maximum 192, and quant is 2.

       Option <b>int-constraint-array-constraint-word-list</b> (6/7) is an int test option with unit percent and  using
       an array or word list constraint.

       Option  <b>int-inexact</b>  (7/7)  is  an  int  test option that increments the requested value and returns flag
       SANE_INFO_INEXACT.

</pre><h4><b>FIXED</b> <b>TEST</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are 3 fixed test options in total.

       Option <b>fixed</b> (1/3) is a fixed test option with no unit and no constraint set.

       Option <b>fixed-constraint-range</b> (2/3) is a fixed test option with unit  microsecond  and  constraint  range
       set. Minimum is -42.17, maximum 32767.9999, and quant is 2.0.

       Option <b>fixed-constraint-word-list</b> (3/3) is a fixed test option with no unit and constraint word list set.

</pre><h4><b>STRING</b> <b>TEST</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are 3 string test options in total.

       Option <b>string</b> (1/3) is a string test option without constraint.

       Option <b>string-constraint-string-list</b> (2/3) is a string test option with string list constraint.

       Option  <b>string-constraint-long-string-list</b>  (3/3)  is  a  string test option with string list constraint.
       Contains some more entries...

</pre><h4><b>BUTTON</b> <b>TEST</b> <b>OPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Option <b>button</b> (1/1) is a Button test option. Prints some text...

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/test.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file (see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below). The initial values
              of most of the basic SANE options can be configured in this file. A template  containing  all  the
              default  values  is provided together with this backend. One of the more interesting values may be
              <b>number_of_devices</b>.  It can be used to check the frontend's ability to show a long list of devices.
              The config values concerning resolution and geometry can be useful to test  the  handling  of  big
              file sizes.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-test.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-test.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of directories that may contain the configuration
              file.  On *NIX systems, the directories are separated by a  colon  (`:'),  under  OS/2,  they  are
              separated  by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file is searched
              in two default directories: first, the current working directory (".") and  then  in  <u>/etc/sane.d</u>.
              If  the  value  of  the environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then the
              default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being
              searched (in this order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_TEST</b>
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug level for this backend.  Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_TEST=4
