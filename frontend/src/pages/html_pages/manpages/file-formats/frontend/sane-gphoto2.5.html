       sane-gphoto2 - SANE backend for gphoto2 supported cameras

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-gphoto2</b> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to the
       digital cameras supported by gphoto2.  This backend has only been tested with a  handful  of  cameras  so
       far.  Patches to support other models are welcome.

       Because  of  the limited testing of this backend, it is commented out in <u>/etc/sane.d/dll.conf</u> by default.
       Either the comment character must be removed or the backend must be called explicitly.   E.g.   <u>scanimage</u>
       <u>-d</u> <u>gphoto2</u> or <u>xscanimage</u> <u>gphoto2</u>.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       The  current  version  of  the backend only allows one camera to be connected.  The device name is always
       "0".

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The contents of the <u>gphoto2.conf</u> specify the characteristics of the  camera  to  be  used.    Resolutions
       (high  resolution,  low  resolution,  and  thumbnail size) are required since they are needed by the sane
       frontends, but can't be obtained through the gphoto2 interface.  Valid ports and cameras can be  obtained
       by <u>gphoto2</u> <u>--list-cameras</u> and <u>gphoto2</u> <u>--list-ports</u>.

       The <b>dumpinquiry</b> line causes some information about the camera to be printed.

       Empty  lines  and  lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  A sample configuration file is shown
       below:

       The <b>topfolder</b> line specifies the "fixed" part of the file path.  For example, on the Kodak DC-240,  files
       are  stored in the directory <u>/DCIM/100DC240.</u>  The <u>/DCIM</u> portion is constant, but 100DC240 will change and
       must be read from the camera.  In this case, the line would read "topfolder=/DCIM"

       Some cameras don't implement a file structure and store  all  pictures  in  the  <u>/</u>  directory.   This  is
       indicated by setting "subdirs=0" with "topfolder=/"

              port=usb:
              camera=Kodak DC240
              # this is a comment
              high_resolution=1280x960
              low_resolution=640x480
              thumb_resolution=160x120
              dumpinquiry

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/gphoto2.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file (see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-gphoto2.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-gphoto2.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of directories that may contain the configuration
              file.  On *NIX systems, the directories are separated by a  colon  (`:'),  under  OS/2,  they  are
              separated  by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file is searched
              in two default directories: first, the current working directory (<u>.</u>)  and then in <u>/etc/sane.d</u>.  If
              the value of the environment variable ends  with  the  directory  separator  character,  then  the
              default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being
              searched (in this order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_GPHOTO2</b>
              If the library was compiled with debugging support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              debug  level  for  this  backend.  A value of 128 requests maximally copious debug output; smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

       <b>GP_DEBUG</b>
              Set to 1, 2, or 3, to enable various levels of debugging within the gphoto2 libraries.

       Many, no doubt.

       More general comments, suggestions, and  inquiries  about  frontends  or  SANE  should  go  to  the  SANE
       Developers  mailing  list  (see <u><a href="http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html">http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html</a></u> for details).  You must be
