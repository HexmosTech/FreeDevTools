</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-dc210 - SANE backend for Kodak DC210 Digital Camera

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-dc210</b>  library  implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to the
       Kodak DC210 camera. THIS IS EXTREMELY ALPHA CODE!  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       The current version of the backend only allows one camera to be connected.  The  device  name  is  always
       "0".

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The contents of the <u>dc210.conf</u> specify the serial port and baud rate to use.  The <b>baud</b> rate specifies the
       maximum  rate to use while downloading pictures.  (The camera is always initialized using 9600 baud, then
       switches to the higher rate).  On my 90MHz Pentium, I usually have no problems downloading at 115200 baud
       as long as the system is not excessively busy and the "interrupt-unmask flag" is set in  the  IDE  driver
       (<u>hdparm</u> <u>-u1</u>).  Supported baud rates are: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200.

       The <b>dumpinquiry</b> line causes some information about the camera to be printed.

       <b>cmdrespause</b>  specifies  how  many usec (1,000,000ths of a second) to wait between writing the command and
       reading the result. 125000 seems to be the lowest I could go reliably.

       <b>breakpause</b> specifies how many usec (1,000,000ths of a second) between sending the "back to default" break
       and sending commands.

       Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  A sample configuration  file  is  shown
       below:

              port=/dev/ttyS0
              # this is a comment
              baud=115200
              dumpinquiry
              cmdrespause=125000
              breakpause=1000000

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/dc210.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file (see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-dc210.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-dc210.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of directories that may contain the configuration
              file.  On *NIX systems, the directories are separated by a  colon  (`:'),  under  OS/2,  they  are
              separated  by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file is searched
              in two default directories: first, the current working directory (".") and  then  in  <u>/etc/sane.d.</u>
              If  the  value  of  the environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then the
              default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being
              searched (in this order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_DC210</b>
              If the library was compiled with debugging support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              debug level for this backend.  A value of 128 requests maximally  copious  debug  output;  smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       Brian J. Murrell

       This backend is based somewhat on the dc25 backend included in this package by Peter Fales.

       The manpage was copied from the dc25 backend and somewhat edited by Henning Meier-Geinitz.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>

       More  general  comments,  suggestions,  and  inquiries  about  frontends  or  SANE  should go to the SANE
       Developers mailing list (see <u><a href="http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html">http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html</a></u> for details).   You  must  be
