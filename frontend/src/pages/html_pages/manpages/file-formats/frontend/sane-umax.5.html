       sane-umax - SANE backend for UMAX scanners

</pre><h4><b>ABOUT</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       This  file is only a brief description of the <b>sane-umax</b> backend for SANE! For detailed information take a
       look at sane-umax-doc.html (it is included in the sane source directory and in the <b><a href="../man1/xsane.1.html">xsane</a></b>(1) online help)!

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>sane-umax</b> library implements a SANE backend that provides access to  several  UMAX-SCSI-scanners  and
       some  Linotype  Hell  SCSI-scanners,  parallel-  and  USB-scanners  are  not (and probably will never be)
       supported!

       <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>power-button</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scanner</b> <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scans!</b>

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file for this backend resides in <u>/etc/sane.d/umax.conf</u>.

       Its contents is a list of device names that correspond to UMAX and UMAX compatible scanners. Empty  lines
       and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. A sample configuration file is shown below:

        # this is a comment
        #
        option scsi-maxqueue 4
        option scsi-buffer-size-min 65536
        option scsi-buffer-size-max 131072
        option scan-lines 40
        option preview-lines 10
        option scsi-maxqueue 2
        option execute-request-sense 0
        option force-preview-bit-rgb 0
        option slow-speed -1
        option care-about-smearing -1
        option calibration-full-ccd -1
        option calibration-width-offset -1
        option calibration-bytes-pixel -1
        option exposure-time-rgb-bind -1
        option invert-shading-data -1
        option lamp-control-available 0
        option gamma-lsb-padded 0
        /dev/sge
        #scsi Vendor Model Type Bus Channel ID LUN
        # The following scanner supports lamp control
        option lamp-control-available 1
        scsi UMAX * Scanner * * * * *
        # scanner on /dev/scanner does not support lamp control
        option lamp-control-available 0
        /dev/scanner

       execute-request-sense:
              values: 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled
              default = 0
              If  set  to  1,  <b>umax_do_request_sense</b>()  is  called  in <b>umax_do_calibration</b>().  This can hang the
              system, but has been enabled until this version.

       scsi-buffer-size-min, scsi-buffer-size-max:
              values: 4096-1048576
              default min = 32768, max = 131072
              Especially the minimum value is very important.  If this value is set too small the backend is not
              able to send gamma tables to the scanner or to do a correct color calibration. This may result  in
              strange  color  effects.  If  the  minimum  value is set too large then the backend is not able to
              allocate the requested SCSI buffer size and aborts with out of memory error. The default is  32KB,
              for some scanners it should be increased to 64KB.

       scan-lines, preview-lines:
              values: 1-65535
              default: scan-lines = 40, preview-lines = 10
              define the maximum number of lines that are scanned into one buffer

       force-preview-bit-rgb:
              values: 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled
              default = 0
              set preview bit in rgb real scan

       slow-speed, care-about-smearing:
              values: -1 = auto, 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled
              default = -1
              Dangerous options, needed for some scanners.
              Do  not  change  these options unless you really know what you are doing otherwise you may destroy
              your scanner with invalid values.

       calibration-full-ccd:
              values: -1 = auto, 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled
              default = -1
              do calibration for each pixel of ccd instead of selected image

       calibration-width-offset:
              values: -99999 = auto, &gt; -99999 set value
              add an offset to the calculated width for image/ccd

       calibration-bytes-pixel:
              values: -1 = disabled, 0 = not set, 1 = 1 byte/pixel, 2 = 2 bytes/pixel
              use # bytes per pixel for calibration

       exposure-time-rgb-bind:
              values: -1 = automatically set by driver - if known, 0 = disabled (own selection  for  red,  green
              and blue), 1 = enabled (same values for red, green and blue)

       invert-shading-data:
              values: -1 = automatically set by driver - if known, 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled
              default = -1
              invert shading data before sending it back to the scanner

       lamp-control-available:
              values: 0 = automatically set by driver - if known, 1 = available
              default = 0

       gamma-lsb-padded:
              values:  -1 = automatically set by driver - if known, 0 = gamma data is msb padded, 1 = gamma data
              is lsb padded
              default = -1

       handle-bad-sense-error:
              values: 0 = handle as device busy, 1 = handle as ok, 2 = handle as i/o error, 3 = ignore bad error
              code - continue sense handler
              default = 0

       scsi-maxqueue:
              values: 1..# (maximum defined at compile time)
              default = 2
              most SCSI drivers allow internal command queueing with a depth of 2 commands.  In  most  cases  it
              does not improve anything when you increase this value. When your SCSI driver does not support any
              command queueing you can try to set this value to 1.

       The  special  device  name  must  be a generic SCSI device or a symlink to such a device.  To find out to
       which device your scanner is assigned and how you have to set the permissions of that device, have a look
       at <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5).

</pre><h4><b>SCSI</b> <b>ADAPTER</b> <b>TIPS</b></h4><pre>
       The ISA-SCSI-adapters that are shipped with some UMAX-scanners are not supported very well  by  Linux  (I
       suggest  not to use it), the PCI-SCSI-adapters that come with some UMAX-scanners are not supported at all
       (as far as I know). On other platforms these SCSI-adapters are not supported. So you  typically  need  to
       purchase  another  SCSI-adapter  that  is  supported by your platform. See the relevant hardware FAQs and
       HOWTOs for your platform for more information.

       The UMAX-scanners do block the SCSI-bus for a few seconds while scanning. It is not necessary to  connect
       the  scanner to its own SCSI-adapter. But if you need short response time for your SCSI-harddisk (e.g. if
       your computer is a file-server) or other SCSI devices, I suggest you use an  own  SCSI-adapter  for  your
       UMAX-scanner.

       If you have any problems with your UMAX scanner, check your SCSI chain (cable length, termination, ...).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The backend configuration file:
              <u>/etc/sane.d/umax.conf</u>

       The static library implementing this backend:
              <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-umax.a</u>

       The shared library implementing this backend:
              <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-umax.so</u> (present on systems that support dynamic loading)

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_DEBUG_UMAX</b>
              If  the  library  was  compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128  requests  all  debug  output  to  be  printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.  <b>SANE_DEBUG_UMAX</b> values:

              Number  Remark
               0       print important errors (printed each time)
               1       print errors
               2       print sense
               3       print warnings
               4       print scanner-inquiry
               5       print information
               6       print less important information
               7       print called procedures
               8       print reader_process messages
               10      print called sane-init-routines
               11      print called sane-procedures
               12      print sane infos
               13      print sane option-control messages

       Example:
              export SANE_DEBUG_UMAX=8

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       X-resolutions greater than 600 dpi sometimes cause problems.
