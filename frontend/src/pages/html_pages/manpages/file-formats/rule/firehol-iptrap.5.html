       firehol-iptrap - dynamically put IP addresses in an ipset

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       {  iptrap | iptrap4 | iptrap6 } <u>ipset</u> <u>type</u> <u>seconds</u> [ timeout | counters ] [ method <b>method</b> ] [<u>rule-params</u>]
       [ except [<u>rule-params</u>] ]...

       { ipuntrap | ipuntrap4 | ipuntrap6 } <u>ipset</u> <u>type</u> [ timeout | counters ] [ method <b>method</b> ] [<u>rule-params</u>]  [
       except [<u>rule-params</u>] ]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       iptrap adds the IP addresses of the matching packets to ipset.

       ipuntrap deletes the IP addresses of the matching packets from ipset.

       Both  helpers  do not affect the flow of traffic.  They do not ACCEPT, REJECT, DROP packets or affect the
       firewall in any way.

       ipset is the name of the ipset to use.

       type selects which of the IP addresses of the matching packets will be used (added or  removed  from  the
       ipset).  type can be src, dst, src,dst, dst,src, etc.  If type is a pair, then the ipset must be an ipset
       of pairs too.

       seconds  is  required by iptrap and gives the duration in seconds of the lifetime of each IP address that
       is added to ipset.  Every matching packet will refresh this duration for the IP  address  in  the  ipset.
       The  Linux  kernel  will automatically remove the IP from the ipset when this time expires.  The user may
       monitor the remaining time for each IP, by running ipset list NAME (where NAME  is  the  ipset  parameter
       given in the iptrap command).

       The seconds value default will not set any seconds.  The ipset default will be used.

       A  seconds  of 0 (zero), writes to the ipset permanently (this is a feature of the ipset command, not the
       ipset FireHOL helper).

       The keywords timeout and counters are mutually exclusive.  timeout is the default and means that each  IP
       address  every  time  is matched its timeout will be refreshed, while counters means that its packets and
       bytes counters will be refreshed.  Unfortunately the kernel either re-add the IP in the  ipset  with  the
       new  timeout  - but its counters will be lost, or just the counters will be updated, but the timeout will
       not be refreshed.

       method is defines the storage method of the underlying  ipset.   It  accepts  all  the  types  the  ipset
       commands accepts.

       method  and type should match.  For example if method is hash:ip then method should be either src or dst.
       If method is hash:ip,ip then method should be either src,dst or dst,src.  If  method  is  hash:ip,port,ip
       method  should  be  src,src,dst or src,dst,dst or dst,src,src or dst,dst,src.  For more information check
       the manual page of the ipset command.

       The <u>rule-params</u> define a set of rule parameters to restrict the traffic that is matched to  this  helper.
       See <a href="../man5/firehol-params.5.html">firehol-params</a>(5) for more details.

       except <u>rule-params</u> are used to exclude traffic, i.e. traffic that normally is matched by the first set of
       <u>rule-params</u>, will be excluded if matched by the second.

       iptrap and ipuntrap are hooked on PREROUTING so it is only useful for incoming traffic.

       iptrap  and  ipuntrap  cannot setup both IPv4 and IPv6 traps with one call.  The reason is that the ipset
       can either be IPv4 or IPv6.

       Both helpers will create the ipset specified, if that ipset is not already created by  other  statements.
       When  the  ipset is created by the iptrap helper, the ipset will not be reset (emptied) when the firewall
       is restarted.

       The  ipset  options  used  when  these  helpers  create  ipsets  can  be  controlled  with  the  variable
       IPTRAP_DEFAULT_IPSET_OPTIONS.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
               # Example: mini-IDS
               # add to the ipset `trap` for an hour (3600 seconds) all IPs from all packets
               # coming from eth0 and going to tcp/3306 (mysql).
               iptrap4 src trap 3600 inface eth0 proto tcp dport 3306 log "TRAPPED HTTP"
               # block them
               blacklist4 full inface eth0 log "BLOCKED" src ipset:trap except src ipset:whitelist

               # Example: ipuntrap
               ipuntrap4 src trap inface eth0 src ipset:trap proto tcp dport 80 log "UNTRAPPED HTTP"

               # Example: a knock
               # The user will be able to knock at tcp/12345
               iptrap4 src knock1 30 inface eth0 proto tcp dport 12345 log "KNOCK STEP 1"
               # in 30 seconds knock at tcp/23456
               iptrap4 src knock2 60 inface eth0 proto tcp dport 23456 src ipset:knock1 log "KNOCK STEP 2"
               # in 60 seconds knock at tcp/34566
               iptrap4 src knock3 90 inface eth0 proto tcp dport 34567 src ipset:knock2 log "KNOCK STEP 3"
               #
               # and in 90 seconds ssh
               interface ...
                   server ssh accept src ipset:knock3
