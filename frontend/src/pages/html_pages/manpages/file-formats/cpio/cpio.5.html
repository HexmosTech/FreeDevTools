       cpio — format of cpio archive files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>cpio</b>  archive  format  collects  any  number  of  files,  directories, and other file system objects
       (symbolic links, device nodes, etc.) into a single stream of bytes.

   <b>General</b> <b>Format</b>
       Each file system object in a <b>cpio</b> archive comprises a header record with basic numeric metadata  followed
       by the full pathname of the entry and the file data.  The header record stores a series of integer values
       that  generally  follow  the  fields  in  <u>struct</u>  <u>stat</u>.   (See <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) for details.)  The variants differ
       primarily in how they store those integers (binary, octal, or hexadecimal).  The header  is  followed  by
       the  pathname  of  the entry (the length of the pathname is stored in the header) and any file data.  The
       end of the archive is indicated by a special record with the pathname “TRAILER!!!”.

   <b>PWB</b> <b>format</b>
       The PWB binary <b>cpio</b> format is the original format, when cpio was introduced as part of  the  Programmer's
       Work  Bench system, a variant of 6th Edition UNIX.  It stores numbers as 2-byte and 4-byte binary values.
       Each entry begins with a header in the following format:

             struct header_pwb_cpio {
                     short   h_magic;
                     short   h_dev;
                     short   h_ino;
                     short   h_mode;
                     short   h_uid;
                     short   h_gid;
                     short   h_nlink;
                     short   h_majmin;
                     long    h_mtime;
                     short   h_namesize;
                     long    h_filesize;
             };

       The <u>short</u> fields here are 16-bit integer values, while the <u>long</u> fields are 32 bit  integers.   Since  PWB
       UNIX,  like  the  6th  Edition UNIX it was based on, only ran on PDP-11 computers, they are in PDP-endian
       format, which has  little-endian  shorts,  and  big-endian  longs.   That  is,  the  long  integer  whose
       hexadecimal  representation  is  0x12345678 would be stored in four successive bytes as 0x34, 0x12, 0x78,
       0x56.  The fields are as follows:

       <u>h_magic</u>
               The integer value octal 070707.

       <u>h_dev</u>, <u>h_ino</u>
               The device and inode numbers from the disk.  These are used by programs that read  <b>cpio</b>  archives
               to  determine  when  two  entries refer to the same file.  Programs that synthesize <b>cpio</b> archives
               should be careful to set these to distinct values for each entry.

       <u>h_mode</u>  The mode specifies both the regular permissions and the file type, and it also holds a couple  of
               bits that are irrelevant to the cpio format, because the field is actually a raw copy of the mode
               field  in the inode representing the file.  These are the IALLOC flag, which shows that the inode
               entry is in use, and the ILARG flag, which shows that the file it represents is large  enough  to
               have indirect blocks pointers in the inode.  The mode is decoded as follows:

               0100000  IALLOC flag - irrelevant to cpio.
               0060000  This masks the file type bits.
               0040000  File type value for directories.
               0020000  File type value for character special devices.
               0060000  File type value for block special devices.
               0010000  ILARG flag - irrelevant to cpio.
               0004000  SUID bit.
               0002000  SGID bit.
               0001000  Sticky bit.
               0000777  The  lower  9  bits  specify  read/write/execute  permissions for world, group, and user
                        following standard POSIX conventions.

       <u>h_uid</u>, <u>h_gid</u>
               The numeric user id and group id of the owner.

       <u>h_nlink</u>
               The number of links to this file.  Directories always have a value of at least  two  here.   Note
               that hardlinked files include file data with every copy in the archive.

       <u>h_majmin</u>
               For  block  special  and  character  special  entries,  this field contains the associated device
               number, with the major number in the high byte, and the minor number in the low  byte.   For  all
               other entry types, it should be set to zero by writers and ignored by readers.

       <u>h_mtime</u>
               Modification  time  of the file, indicated as the number of seconds since the start of the epoch,
               00:00:00 UTC January 1, 1970.

       <u>h_namesize</u>
               The number of bytes in the pathname that follows the header.  This count  includes  the  trailing
               NUL byte.

       <u>h_filesize</u>
               The  size  of  the  file.   Note  that  this archive format is limited to 16 megabyte file sizes,
               because PWB UNIX, like 6th Edition, only used an unsigned  24  bit  integer  for  the  file  size
               internally.

       The pathname immediately follows the fixed header.  If <b>h_namesize</b> is odd, an additional NUL byte is added
       after  the  pathname.  The file data is then appended, again with an additional NUL appended if needed to
       get the next header at an even offset.

       Hardlinked files are not given special treatment; the full file contents are included with each  copy  of
       the file.

   <b>New</b> <b>Binary</b> <b>Format</b>
       The  new  binary  <b>cpio</b>  format showed up when cpio was adopted into late 7th Edition UNIX.  It is exactly
       like the PWB binary format, described above, except for three changes:

       First, UNIX now ran on more than one hardware type,  so  the  endianness  of  16  bit  integers  must  be
       determined  by  observing  the  magic  number  at the start of the header.  The 32 bit integers are still
       always stored with the most significant word first, though, so each of those two,  in  the  struct  shown
       above,  was  stored as an array of two 16 bit integers, in the traditional order.  Those 16 bit integers,
       like all the others in the struct, were accessed using a macro that byte swapped them if necessary.

       Next, 7th Edition had more file types to store, and the IALLOC and ILARG flag bits  were  re-purposed  to
       accommodate these.  The revised use of the various bits is as follows:

       0170000  This masks the file type bits.
       0140000  File type value for sockets.
       0120000  File type value for symbolic links.  For symbolic links, the link body is stored as file data.
       0100000  File type value for regular files.
       0060000  File type value for block special devices.
       0040000  File type value for directories.
       0020000  File type value for character special devices.
       0010000  File type value for named pipes or FIFOs.
       0004000  SUID bit.
       0002000  SGID bit.
       0001000  Sticky bit.
       0000777  The  lower  9  bits  specify read/write/execute permissions for world, group, and user following
                standard POSIX conventions.

       Finally, the file size field now represents a signed 32 bit integer in the underlying file system, so the
       maximum file size has increased to 2 gigabytes.

       Note that there is no obvious way to tell which of the two binary formats an archive uses, other than  to
       see  which  one makes more sense.  The typical error scenario is that a PWB format archive unpacked as if
       it were in the new format will create named sockets instead of directories, and then fail to unpack files
       that should go in those directories.  Running <u>bsdcpio</u> <u>-itv</u> on an unknown archive  will  make  it  obvious
       which  it  is:  if  it's PWB format, directories will be listed with an 's' instead of a 'd' as the first
       character of the mode string, and the larger files will have a '?' in that position.

   <b>Portable</b> <b>ASCII</b> <b>Format</b>
       Version 2 of the Single UNIX Specification (“SUSv2”) standardized  an  ASCII  variant  that  is  portable
       across  all  platforms.   It  is commonly known as the “old character” format or as the “odc” format.  It
       stores the same numeric fields  as  the  old  binary  format,  but  represents  them  as  6-character  or
       11-character octal values.

             struct cpio_odc_header {
                     char    c_magic[6];
                     char    c_dev[6];
                     char    c_ino[6];
                     char    c_mode[6];
                     char    c_uid[6];
                     char    c_gid[6];
                     char    c_nlink[6];
                     char    c_rdev[6];
                     char    c_mtime[11];
                     char    c_namesize[6];
                     char    c_filesize[11];
             };

       The  fields  are  identical  to  those in the new binary format.  The name and file body follow the fixed
       header.  Unlike the binary formats, there is no additional padding after the pathname or  file  contents.
       If  the  files  being archived are themselves entirely ASCII, then the resulting archive will be entirely
       ASCII, except for the NUL byte that terminates the name field.

   <b>New</b> <b>ASCII</b> <b>Format</b>
       The "new" ASCII format uses 8-byte hexadecimal fields for all numbers and separates device  numbers  into
       separate fields for major and minor numbers.

             struct cpio_newc_header {
                     char    c_magic[6];
                     char    c_ino[8];
                     char    c_mode[8];
                     char    c_uid[8];
                     char    c_gid[8];
                     char    c_nlink[8];
                     char    c_mtime[8];
                     char    c_filesize[8];
                     char    c_devmajor[8];
                     char    c_devminor[8];
                     char    c_rdevmajor[8];
                     char    c_rdevminor[8];
                     char    c_namesize[8];
                     char    c_check[8];
             };

       Except as specified below, the fields here match those specified for the new binary format above.

       <u>magic</u>   The string “070701”.

       <u>check</u>   This  field  is  always  set to zero by writers and ignored by readers.  See the next section for
               more details.

       The pathname is followed by NUL bytes so that the total size of the  fixed  header  plus  pathname  is  a
       multiple  of four.  Likewise, the file data is padded to a multiple of four bytes.  Note that this format
       supports only 4 gigabyte files (unlike the older ASCII format, which supports 8 gigabyte files).

       In this format, hardlinked files are handled by setting the filesize to zero for each  entry  except  the
       first one that appears in the archive.

   <b>New</b> <b>CRC</b> <b>Format</b>
       The  CRC  format  is  identical to the new ASCII format described in the previous section except that the
       magic field is set to “070702” and the <u>check</u> field is set to the sum of all bytes in the file data.  This
       sum is computed treating all bytes as unsigned values and using unsigned  arithmetic.   Only  the  least-
       significant 32 bits of the sum are stored.

   <b>HP</b> <b>variants</b>
       The <b>cpio</b> implementation distributed with HPUX used XXXX but stored device numbers differently XXX.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Extensions</b> <b>and</b> <b>Variants</b>

       attributes, as special entries in cpio archives.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>cpio</b> utility is no longer a part of POSIX or the Single Unix Standard.  It last appeared in Version 2
       of the Single UNIX Specification (“SUSv2”).  It has been supplanted in subsequent  standards  by  <u><a href="../man1/pax.1.html">pax</a></u>(1).
       The portable ASCII format is currently part of the specification for the <u><a href="../man1/pax.1.html">pax</a></u>(1) utility.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The  original  cpio  utility  was  written by Dick Haight while working in AT&amp;T's Unix Support Group.  It
       appeared in 1977 as part of PWB/UNIX 1.0, the “Programmer's Work Bench” derived from Version 6 AT&amp;T  UNIX
       that  was  used  internally  at AT&amp;T.  Both the new binary and old character formats were in use by 1980,
       according to the System III source released by SCO under their “Ancient  Unix”  license.   The  character
       format  was  adopted  as  part  of  IEEE  Std  1003.1-1988 (“POSIX.1”).  XXX when did "newc" appear?  Who
       invented it?  When did HP come out with  their  variant?   When  did  Sun  introduce  ACLs  and  extended
       attributes? XXX

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The “CRC” format is mis-named, as it uses a simple checksum and not a cyclic redundancy check.

       The  binary  formats  are  limited to 16 bits for user id, group id, device, and inode numbers.  They are
       limited to 16 megabyte and 2 gigabyte file sizes for the older and newer variants, respectively.

       The old ASCII format is limited to 18 bits for the user id, group id, device, and inode numbers.   It  is
       limited to 8 gigabyte file sizes.

       The new ASCII format is limited to 4 gigabyte file sizes.

       None of the cpio formats store user or group names, which are essential when moving files between systems
       with dissimilar user or group numbering.

       Especially  when  writing  older  cpio variants, it may be necessary to map actual device/inode values to
       synthesized values that fit the available fields.  With very large filesystems,  this  may  be  necessary
       even for the newer formats.
