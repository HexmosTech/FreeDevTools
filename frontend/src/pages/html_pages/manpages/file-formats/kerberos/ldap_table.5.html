       ldap_table - Postfix LDAP client configuration

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>postmap</b> <b>-q</b> <b>"</b><u>string</u><b>"</b> <b>ldap:/etc/postfix/</b><u>filename</u>

       <b>postmap</b> <b>-q</b> <b>-</b> <b>ldap:/etc/postfix/</b><u>filename</u> <b>&lt;</b><u>inputfile</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Postfix  mail  system  uses  optional tables for address rewriting or mail routing. These tables are
       usually in <b>dbm</b> or <b>db</b> format.

       Alternatively, lookup tables can be specified as LDAP databases.

       In order to use LDAP lookups, define an LDAP source as a lookup table in main.cf, for example:

           alias_maps = ldap:/etc/postfix/ldap-aliases.cf

       The file /etc/postfix/ldap-aliases.cf has the same format as the Postfix main.cf file,  and  can  specify
       the parameters described below. An example is given at the end of this manual.

       This  configuration  method  is  available with Postfix version 2.1 and later.  See the section "OBSOLETE
       MAIN.CF PARAMETERS" below for older Postfix versions.

       For details about LDAP SSL and STARTTLS, see the section on SSL and STARTTLS below.

</pre><h4><b>LIST</b> <b>MEMBERSHIP</b></h4><pre>
       When   using   LDAP   to   store   lists   such   as   $mynetworks,    $mydestination,    $relay_domains,
       $local_recipient_maps,  etc., it is important to understand that the table must store each list member as
       a separate key. The table lookup verifies the *existence* of the key. See "Postfix lists  versus  tables"
       in the DATABASE_README document for a discussion.

       Do NOT create tables that return the full list of domains in $mydestination or $relay_domains etc., or IP
       addresses in $mynetworks.

       DO  create tables with each matching item as a key and with an arbitrary value. With LDAP databases it is
       not uncommon to return the key itself.

       For example, NEVER do this in a map defining $mydestination:

           query_filter = domain=*
           result_attribute = domain

       Do this instead:

           query_filter = domain=%s
           result_attribute = domain

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       In the text below, default values are given in parentheses.  Note: don't use quotes in  these  variables;
       at least, not until the Postfix configuration routines understand how to deal with quoted strings.

       <b>server_host</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>localhost)</b>
              The name of the host running the LDAP server, e.g.

                  server_host = ldap.example.com

              Depending  on  the  LDAP  client  library  you're using, it should be possible to specify multiple
              servers here, with the library trying them in order should the first one fail. It should  also  be
              possible  to  give  each  server  in  the list a different port (overriding <b>server_port</b> below), by
              naming them like

                  server_host = ldap.example.com:1444

              NOTE: this client will reconnect immediately after a  single  failure,  and  will  fail  a  lookup
              request after a second attempt also fails.

              With OpenLDAP, a (list of) LDAP URLs can be used to specify both the hostname(s) and the port(s):

                  server_host = ldap://ldap.example.com:1444
                              ldap://ldap2.example.com:1444

              All  LDAP  URLs  accepted  by  the OpenLDAP library are supported, including connections over UNIX
              domain sockets, and LDAP SSL (the last one provided that OpenLDAP was compiled  with  support  for
              SSL):

                  server_host = ldapi://%2Fsome%2Fpath
                              ldaps://ldap.example.com:636

       <b>server_port</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>389)</b>
              The port the LDAP server listens on, e.g.

                  server_port = 778

       <b>timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10</b> <b>seconds)</b>
              The number of seconds a search can take before timing out, e.g.

                  timeout = 5

       <b>search_base</b> <b>(No</b> <b>default;</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>configure</b> <b>this)</b>
              The RFC2253 base DN at which to conduct the search, e.g.

                  search_base = dc=your, dc=com

              With Postfix 2.2 and later this parameter supports the following '%' expansions:

              <b>%%</b>     This is replaced by a literal '%' character.

              <b>%s</b>     This  is  replaced  by the input key.  RFC 2253 quoting is used to make sure that the input
                     key does not add unexpected metacharacters.

              <b>%u</b>     When the input key is an address of the form user@domain, <b>%u</b> is replaced by the (RFC  2253)
                     quoted  local  part of the address.  Otherwise, <b>%u</b> is replaced by the entire search string.
                     If the localpart is empty, the search is suppressed and returns no results.

              <b>%d</b>     When the input key is an address of the form user@domain, <b>%d</b> is replaced by the (RFC  2253)
                     quoted  domain  part  of  the  address.  Otherwise, the search is suppressed and returns no
                     results.

              <b>%[SUD]</b> For the <b>search_base</b> parameter, the upper-case equivalents of the  above  expansions  behave
                     identically to their lower-case counter-parts. With the <b>result_format</b> parameter (previously
                     called <b>result_filter</b> see the OTHER OBSOLETE FEATURES section and below), they expand to the
                     corresponding components of input key rather than the result value.

              <b>%[1-9]</b> The patterns %1, %2, ... %9 are replaced by the corresponding most significant component of
                     the  input  key's  domain. If the input key is <u><a href="mailto:user@mail.example.com">user@mail.example.com</a></u>, then %1 is <b>com</b>, %2 is
                     <b>example</b> and %3 is <b>mail</b>. If the input key is unqualified or  does  not  have  enough  domain
                     components  to  satisfy all the specified patterns, the search is suppressed and returns no
                     results.

       <b>query_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>mailacceptinggeneralid=%s)</b>
              The RFC2254 filter used to search the directory, where <b>%s</b> is a substitute for the address  Postfix
              is trying to resolve, e.g.

                  query_filter = (&amp;(mail=%s)(paid_up=true))

              This parameter supports the following '%' expansions:

              <b>%%</b>     This is replaced by a literal '%' character. (Postfix 2.2 and later).

              <b>%s</b>     This  is  replaced  by the input key.  RFC 2254 quoting is used to make sure that the input
                     key does not add unexpected metacharacters.

              <b>%u</b>     When the input key is an address of the form user@domain, <b>%u</b> is replaced by the (RFC  2254)
                     quoted  local  part of the address.  Otherwise, <b>%u</b> is replaced by the entire search string.
                     If the localpart is empty, the search is suppressed and returns no results.

              <b>%d</b>     When the input key is an address of the form user@domain, <b>%d</b> is replaced by the (RFC  2254)
                     quoted  domain  part  of  the  address.  Otherwise, the search is suppressed and returns no
                     results.

              <b>%[SUD]</b> The upper-case equivalents of the above expansions behave  in  the  <b>query_filter</b>  parameter
                     identically to their lower-case counter-parts. With the <b>result_format</b> parameter (previously
                     called <b>result_filter</b> see the OTHER OBSOLETE FEATURES section and below), they expand to the
                     corresponding components of input key rather than the result value.

                     The above %S, %U and %D expansions are available with Postfix 2.2 and later.

              <b>%[1-9]</b> The patterns %1, %2, ... %9 are replaced by the corresponding most significant component of
                     the  input  key's  domain. If the input key is <u><a href="mailto:user@mail.example.com">user@mail.example.com</a></u>, then %1 is <b>com</b>, %2 is
                     <b>example</b> and %3 is <b>mail</b>. If the input key is unqualified or  does  not  have  enough  domain
                     components  to  satisfy all the specified patterns, the search is suppressed and returns no
                     results.

                     The above %1, ..., %9 expansions are available with Postfix 2.2 and later.

              The "domain" parameter described below limits the input keys to  addresses  in  matching  domains.
              When  the  "domain" parameter is non-empty, LDAP queries for unqualified addresses or addresses in
              non-matching domains are suppressed and return no results.

              NOTE: DO NOT put quotes around the <b>query_filter</b> parameter.

       <b>result_format</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>%s</b>)
              Called <b>result_filter</b> in Postfix  releases  prior  to  2.2.   Format  template  applied  to  result
              attributes.  Most commonly used to append (or prepend) text to the result. This parameter supports
              the following '%' expansions:

              <b>%%</b>     This is replaced by a literal '%' character. (Postfix 2.2 and later).

              <b>%s</b>     This is replaced by the value of the result attribute. When result is empty it is skipped.

              <b>%u</b>     When the result attribute value is an address of the form user@domain, <b>%u</b>  is  replaced  by
                     the local part of the address. When the result has an empty localpart it is skipped.

              <b>%d</b>     When  a result attribute value is an address of the form user@domain, <b>%d</b> is replaced by the
                     domain part of the attribute value. When the result is unqualified it is skipped.

              <b>%[SUD1-9]</b>
                     The upper-case and decimal digit expansions interpolate the parts of the input  key  rather
                     than  the  result.  Their behavior is identical to that described with <b>query_filter</b>, and in
                     fact because the input key is known in advance, lookups whose key does not contain all  the
                     information specified in the result template are suppressed and return no results.

                     The above %S, %U, %D and %1, ..., %9 expansions are available with Postfix 2.2 and later.

              For example, using "result_format = smtp:[%s]" allows one to use a mailHost attribute as the basis
              of  a  <a href="../man5/transport.5.html">transport</a>(5)  table.  After applying the result format, multiple values are concatenated as
              comma separated strings. The expansion_limit and size_limit parameters explained below  allow  one
              to  restrict  the  number of values in the result, which is especially useful for maps that should
              return a single value.

              The default value <b>%s</b> specifies that each attribute value should be used as is.

              This parameter was called <b>result_filter</b> in Postfix releases prior to 2.2. If no "result_format" is
              specified, the value of "result_filter" will be used  instead  before  resorting  to  the  default
              value. This provides compatibility with old configuration files.

              NOTE: DO NOT put quotes around the result format!

       <b>domain</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no</b> <b>domain</b> <b>list)</b>
              This  is  a  list of domain names, paths to files, or "type:table" databases. When specified, only
              fully qualified search keys with a *non-empty* localpart and a matching domain  are  eligible  for
              lookup:  'user'  lookups,  bare  domain  lookups and "@domain" lookups are not performed. This can
              significantly reduce the query load on the LDAP server.

                  domain = postfix.org, hash:/etc/postfix/searchdomains

              It is best not to use LDAP to store the domains eligible for LDAP lookups.

              NOTE: DO NOT define this parameter for <a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a>(8) aliases.

              This feature is available in Postfix 1.0 and later.

       <b>result_attribute</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>maildrop)</b>
              The attribute(s) Postfix will read from any directory  entries  returned  by  the  lookup,  to  be
              resolved to an email address.

                  result_attribute = mailbox, maildrop

              Don't  rely  on  the  default  value ("maildrop"). Set the result_attribute explicitly in all ldap
              table configuration files. This is particularly relevant when no result_attribute  is  applicable,
              e.g.  cases  in which leaf_result_attribute and/or terminal_result_attribute are used instead. The
              default value is harmless if "maildrop" is also listed as a leaf or terminal result attribute, but
              it is best to not leave this to chance.

       <b>special_result_attribute</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
              The attribute(s) of directory entries that can contain DNs or RFC 2255  LDAP  URLs.  If  found,  a
              recursive  search  is performed to retrieve the entry referenced by the DN, or the entries matched
              by the URL query.

                  special_result_attribute = memberdn

              DN recursion retrieves the same  result_attributes  as  the  main  query,  including  the  special
              attributes for further recursion.

              URL processing retrieves only those attributes that are included in both the URL definition and as
              result  attributes  (ordinary, special, leaf or terminal) in the Postfix table definition.  If the
              URL lists any of the table's special result attributes, these are retrieved and used  recursively.
              A  URL  that  does  not  specify  any  attribute selection, is equivalent (RFC 2255) to a URL that
              selects all attributes, in which case the selected attributes will  be  the  full  set  of  result
              attributes in the Postfix table.

              If  an LDAP URL attribute-descriptor or the corresponding Postfix LDAP table result attribute (but
              not both) uses RFC 2255 sub-type options ("attr;option"), the attribute requested  from  the  LDAP
              server  will  include  the  sub-type  option.  In all other cases, the URL attribute and the table
              attribute must match exactly. Attributes with options in both the URL and the  Postfix  table  are
              requested  only  when the options are identical. LDAP attribute-descriptor options are very rarely
              used, most LDAP users will not need to concern themselves with this level of nuanced detail.

       <b>terminal_result_attribute</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
              When one or more terminal result  attributes  are  found  in  an  LDAP  entry,  all  other  result
              attributes  are  ignored  and only the terminal result attributes are returned. This is useful for
              delegating expansion of group members to a  particular  host,  by  using  an  optional  "maildrop"
              attribute  on  selected groups to route the group to a specific host, where the group is expanded,
              possibly via mailing-list manager or other special processing.

                  result_attribute =
                  terminal_result_attribute = maildrop

              When using terminal and/or leaf result attributes, the result_attribute is best set  to  an  empty
              value  when it is not used, or else explicitly set to the desired value, even if it is the default
              value "maildrop".

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.4 or later.

       <b>leaf_result_attribute</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
              When one or more special result attributes are found in a non-terminal  (see  above)  LDAP  entry,
              leaf  result  attributes  are  excluded  from  the  expansion  of  that entry. This is useful when
              expanding groups and the desired mail address attribute(s) of the member objects obtained  via  DN
              or  URI  recursion  are also present in the group object. To only return the attribute values from
              the leaf objects and not the containing group, add  the  attribute  to  the  leaf_result_attribute
              list,  and  not  the  result_attribute  list, which is always expanded. Note, the default value of
              "result_attribute"  is  not  empty,  you  may  want  to  set  it  explicitly  empty   when   using
              "leaf_result_attribute"  to expand the group to a list of member DN addresses. If groups have both
              member DN references AND attributes that hold multiple string valued rfc822  addresses,  then  the
              string  attributes go in "result_attribute".  The attributes that represent the email addresses of
              objects referenced via a DN (or LDAP URI) go in "leaf_result_attribute".

                  result_attribute = memberaddr
                  special_result_attribute = memberdn
                  terminal_result_attribute = maildrop
                  leaf_result_attribute = mail

              When using terminal and/or leaf result attributes, the result_attribute is best set  to  an  empty
              value  when it is not used, or else explicitly set to the desired value, even if it is the default
              value "maildrop".

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.4 or later.

       <b>scope</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>sub)</b>
              The  LDAP  search  scope:  <b>sub</b>,  <b>base</b>,  or  <b>one</b>.    These   translate   into   LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE,
              LDAP_SCOPE_BASE, and LDAP_SCOPE_ONELEVEL.

       <b>bind</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
              Whether  or  how  to  bind to the LDAP server. Newer LDAP implementations don't require clients to
              bind, which saves time. Example:

                  # Don't bind
                  bind = no
                  # Use SIMPLE bind
                  bind = yes
                  # Use SASL bind
                  bind = sasl

              Postfix versions prior to 2.8 only support "bind = no" which means don't bind, and  "bind  =  yes"
              which  means  do  a  SIMPLE bind.  Postfix 2.8 and later also supports "bind = SASL" when compiled
              with LDAP SASL support as described in LDAP_README, it also adds the synonyms "bind  =  none"  and
              "bind  =  simple"  for  "bind  = no" and "bind = yes" respectively. See the SASL section below for
              additional parameters available with "bind = sasl".

              If you do need to bind, you might consider configuring Postfix to connect to the local machine  on
              a port that's an SSL tunnel to your LDAP server. If your LDAP server doesn't natively support SSL,
              put  a  tunnel  (wrapper,  proxy,  whatever  you  want to call it) on that system too. This should
              prevent the password from traversing the network in the clear.

       <b>bind_dn</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
              If you do have to bind, do it with this distinguished name. Example:

                  bind_dn = uid=postfix, dc=your, dc=com
              With "bind = sasl" (see above) the DN may be optional for some SASL mechanisms, don't specify a DN
              if not needed.

       <b>bind_pw</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
              The password for the distinguished name above. If you have to use this, you probably want to  make
              the  map  configuration  file  readable  only  by  the  Postfix  user.  When  using  the  obsolete
              ldap:ldapsource syntax, with map parameters in main.cf, it is not possible to securely  store  the
              bind  password.  This  is  because  main.cf  needs to be world readable to allow local accounts to
              submit mail via the sendmail command. Example:

                  bind_pw = postfixpw
              With "bind = sasl" (see above) the password may  be  optional  for  some  SASL  mechanisms,  don't
              specify a password if not needed.

       <b>cache</b> <b>(IGNORED</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning)</b>

       <b>cache_expiry</b> <b>(IGNORED</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning)</b>

       <b>cache_size</b> <b>(IGNORED</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning)</b>
              The  above  parameters  are  NO  LONGER SUPPORTED by Postfix.  Cache support has been dropped from
              OpenLDAP as of release 2.1.13.

       <b>recursion_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000)</b>
              A limit on the nesting depth of DN and URL special result attribute evaluation. The limit must  be
              a non-zero positive number.

       <b>expansion_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
              A  limit  on  the total number of result elements returned (as a comma separated list) by a lookup
              against the map.  A setting of zero disables the limit. Lookups fail with a temporary error if the
              limit is exceeded.  Setting the limit to 1 ensures that lookups do not return multiple values.

       <b>size_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$expansion_limit)</b>
              A limit on the number of LDAP entries returned by any single LDAP search performed as part of  the
              lookup.  A  setting  of  0 disables the limit.  Expansion of DN and URL references involves nested
              LDAP queries, each of which is separately subjected to this limit.

              Note: even a single  LDAP  entry  can  generate  multiple  lookup  results,  via  multiple  result
              attributes  and/or  multi-valued  result  attributes.  This  limit  caps  the  per search resource
              utilization on the LDAP server, not the final multiplicity of the lookup result. It  is  analogous
              to the "-z" option of "ldapsearch".

       <b>dereference</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
              When  to  dereference  LDAP  aliases.  (Note  that  this has nothing do with Postfix aliases.) The
              permitted values are those legal for the OpenLDAP/UM LDAP implementations:

              0      never

              1      when searching

              2      when locating the base object for the search

              3      always

              See ldap.h or the <a href="../man3/ldap_open.3.html">ldap_open</a>(3) or <a href="../man1/ldapsearch.1.html">ldapsearch</a>(1) man pages for  more  information.  And  if  you're
              using  an  LDAP  package  that  has other possible values, please bring it to the attention of the
              <a href="mailto:postfix-users@postfix.org">postfix-users@postfix.org</a> mailing list.

       <b>chase_referrals</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
              Sets (or clears) LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS (requires LDAP version 3 support).

       <b>version</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3)</b>
              Specifies the LDAP protocol version to use.

       <b>debuglevel</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
              What level to set for debugging in the OpenLDAP libraries.

</pre><h4><b>LDAP</b> <b>SASL</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       If you're using the OpenLDAP libraries compiled with SASL support, Postfix 2.8 and later built with  LDAP
       SASL support as described in LDAP_README can authenticate to LDAP servers via SASL.

       This  enables  authentication  to  the LDAP server via mechanisms other than a simple password. The added
       flexibility has a cost: it is no longer practical to set an explicit timeout on the duration of  an  LDAP
       bind  operation.  Under adverse conditions, whether a SASL bind times out, or if it does, the duration of
       the timeout is determined by the LDAP and SASL libraries.

       It is best to use tables that use SASL binds  via  <a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html">proxymap</a>(8),  this  way  the  requesting  process  can
       time-out  the  proxymap  request.  This  also  lets  you tailer the process environment by overriding the
       <a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html">proxymap</a>(8) import_environment setting in <a href="../man5/master.cf.5.html">master.cf</a>(5). Special environment settings  may  be  needed  to
       configure  GSSAPI credential caches or other SASL mechanism specific options. The GSSAPI credentials used
       for LDAP lookups may need to be different than say those used for the Postfix SMTP client to authenticate
       to remote servers.

       Using SASL mechanisms requires LDAP protocol version 3, the default protocol version is 2  for  backwards
       compatibility. You must set "version = 3" in addition to "bind = sasl".

       The following parameters are relevant to using LDAP with SASL

       <b>sasl_mechs</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
              Space separated list of SASL mechanism(s) to try.

       <b>sasl_realm</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
              SASL Realm to use, if applicable.

       <b>sasl_authz_id</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b>
              The SASL authorization identity to assert, if applicable.

       <b>sasl_minssf</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
              The minimum required sasl security factor required to establish a connection.

</pre><h4><b>LDAP</b> <b>SSL</b> <b>AND</b> <b>STARTTLS</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       If you're using the OpenLDAP libraries compiled with SSL support, Postfix can connect to LDAP SSL servers
       and can issue the STARTTLS command.

       LDAP SSL service can be requested by using a LDAP SSL URL in the server_host parameter:

           server_host = ldaps://ldap.example.com:636

       STARTTLS can be turned on with the start_tls parameter:

           start_tls = yes

       Both forms require LDAP protocol version 3, which has to be set explicitly with:

           version = 3

       If  any  of  the  Postfix  programs  querying the map is configured in master.cf to run chrooted, all the
       certificates and keys involved have to be copied to the chroot jail. Of course, the private  keys  should
       only be readable by the user "postfix".

       The following parameters are relevant to LDAP SSL and STARTTLS:

       <b>start_tls</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
              Whether or not to issue STARTTLS upon connection to the server.  Don't set this with LDAP SSL (the
              SSL session is setup automatically when the TCP connection is opened).

       <b>tls_ca_cert_dir</b> <b>(No</b> <b>default;</b> <b>set</b> <b>either</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>tls_ca_cert_file)</b>
              Directory  containing  X509  Certification  Authority  certificates  in PEM format which are to be
              recognized by the client in SSL/TLS connections. The files each contain one CA  certificate.   The
              files are looked up by the CA subject name hash value, which must hence be available. If more than
              one  CA  certificate  with  the  same name hash value exist, the extension must be different (e.g.
              9d66eef0.0, 9d66eef0.1 etc). The search is performed in the  ordering  of  the  extension  number,
              regardless  of  other  properties  of the certificates. Use the c_rehash utility (from the OpenSSL
              distribution) to create the necessary links.

       <b>tls_ca_cert_file</b> <b>(No</b> <b>default;</b> <b>set</b> <b>either</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>tls_ca_cert_dir)</b>
              File containing the X509 Certification Authority certificates  in  PEM  format  which  are  to  be
              recognized   by   the   client   in  SSL/TLS  connections.  This  setting  takes  precedence  over
              tls_ca_cert_dir.

       <b>tls_cert</b> <b>(No</b> <b>default;</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>set</b> <b>this)</b>
              File containing client's X509 certificate to be used by the client in SSL/ TLS connections.

       <b>tls_key</b> <b>(No</b> <b>default;</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>set</b> <b>this)</b>
              File containing the private key corresponding to the above tls_cert.

       <b>tls_require_cert</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
              Whether or not to request server's X509 certificate  and  check  its  validity  when  establishing
              SSL/TLS connections.  The supported values are <b>no</b> and <b>yes</b>.

              With <b>no</b>, the server certificate trust chain is not checked, but with OpenLDAP prior to 2.1.13, the
              name  in  the  server  certificate  must  still match the LDAP server name. With OpenLDAP 2.0.0 to
              2.0.11 the server name is not necessarily what you specified, rather it is determined (by  reverse
              lookup)  from  the  IP  address  of  the  LDAP  server  connection. With OpenLDAP prior to 2.0.13,
              subjectAlternativeName extensions in the LDAP server certificate are ignored: the server name must
              match the subject CommonName. The <b>no</b> setting corresponds to the <b>never</b> value of <b>TLS_REQCERT</b> in LDAP
              client configuration files.

              Don't use TLS with OpenLDAP 2.0.x (and especially with x &lt;= 11) if you can avoid it.

              With <b>yes</b>, the server certificate must be issued by a trusted CA, and  not  be  expired.  The  LDAP
              server name must match one of the name(s) found in the certificate (see above for OpenLDAP library
              version  dependent  behavior).  The  <b>yes</b> setting corresponds to the <b>demand</b> value of <b>TLS_REQCERT</b> in
              LDAP client configuration files.

              The "try" and "allow" values of <b>TLS_REQCERT</b> have no equivalents here. They are not available  with
              OpenLDAP  2.0, and in any case have questionable security properties. Either you want TLS verified
              LDAP connections, or you don't.

              The <b>yes</b> value only works correctly with Postfix 2.5 and  later,  or  with  OpenLDAP  2.0.  Earlier
              Postfix  releases  or  later  OpenLDAP releases don't work together with this setting. Support for
              LDAP over TLS was added to Postfix based on the OpenLDAP 2.0 API.

       <b>tls_random_file</b> <b>(No</b> <b>default)</b>
              Path of a file to obtain random bits from when <a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>[u]random is not available, to be used by  the
              client in SSL/TLS connections.

       <b>tls_cipher_suite</b> <b>(No</b> <b>default)</b>
              Cipher suite to use in SSL/TLS negotiations.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Here's a basic example for using LDAP to look up <a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a>(8) aliases.  Assume that in main.cf, you have:

           alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases,
                   ldap:/etc/postfix/ldap-aliases.cf

       and in ldap:/etc/postfix/ldap-aliases.cf you have:

           server_host = ldap.example.com
           search_base = dc=example, dc=com

       Upon receiving mail for a local address "ldapuser" that isn't found in the /etc/aliases database, Postfix
       will  search the LDAP server listening at port 389 on ldap.example.com.  It will bind anonymously, search
       for any directory entries whose mailacceptinggeneralid  attribute  is  "ldapuser",  read  the  "maildrop"
       attributes of those found, and build a list of their maildrops, which will be treated as RFC822 addresses
       to which the message will be delivered.

</pre><h4><b>OBSOLETE</b> <b>MAIN.CF</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       For  backwards compatibility with Postfix version 2.0 and earlier, LDAP parameters can also be defined in
       main.cf.  Specify as LDAP source a name that doesn't begin with a slash or a dot.   The  LDAP  parameters
       will  then  be  accessible  as the name you've given the source in its definition, an underscore, and the
       name of the parameter.  For example, if the map is  specified  as  "ldap:<u>ldapsource</u>",  the  "server_host"
       parameter below would be defined in main.cf as "<u>ldapsource</u>_server_host".

       Note:  with  this  form,  the  passwords  for  the LDAP sources are written in main.cf, which is normally
       world-readable.  Support for this form will be removed in a future Postfix version.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OBSOLETE</b> <b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>result_filter</b> <b>(No</b> <b>default)</b>
              For backwards compatibility with the pre 2.2 LDAP clients,  <b>result_filter</b>  can  for  now  be  used
              instead of <b>result_format</b>, when the latter parameter is not also set.  The new name better reflects
              the function of the parameter. This compatibility interface may be removed in a future release.
