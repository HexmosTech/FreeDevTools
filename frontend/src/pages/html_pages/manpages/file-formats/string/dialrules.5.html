       dialrules - <u>HylaFAX</u> dial string processing rules

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  dial  string specifies how to dial the telephone in order to reach a destination facsimile machine, or
       similar device.  This string is supplied by a user with each outgoing facsimile job.  User-supplied  dial
       strings  need  to  be  processed  in two ways by the <u>HylaFAX</u> server processes: to craft a canonical phone
       number for use in locating the receiver's capabilities, and to process into a form suitable  for  sending
       to  a  modem.  In addition client applications may need to process a dial string to formulate an external
       form that does not include private  information  such  as  a  credit  card  access  code.   Phone  number
       canonicalization  and dial string preparation are done according to <u>dial</u> <u>string</u> <u>processing</u> <u>rules</u> that are
       located in a file specified in the server  configuration  file;  see  the  <b>DialStringRules</b>  parameter  in
       <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-config.5.html">hylafax-config</a></u>(5).   The  generation  of  an  externalized  form  for a dial string is done by rules that
       optionally appear in <u>/etc/hylafax/dialrules</u> on client machines.

       A dial string rules file is an ASCII file containing one or more <u>rule</u> <u>sets</u>.  A rule set defines a set  of
       <u>transformation</u> <u>rules</u> that are sequentially applied to a dial string.  Each rule set is associated with an
       identifier, with certain well-known identifiers being used by the facsimile server or client application.
       Each  transformation  rule  is  a  regular expression and a replacement string; the regular expression is
       repeatedly applied to a dial string and any matching substring is replaced by the replacement string.

       The syntax of a dial string rules file is as follows.  Comments are introduced with the  ``!''  character
       and  continue  to  the end of the current line.  Identifiers are formed from a leading alphabetic and any
       number of subsequent alpha-numeric characters.  A rule set is of the form:
              <u>Identifier</u> <b>:=</b> <b>[</b>
                  <u>rule1</u>
                  <u>rule2</u>
                  ...
              <b>]</b>
       where <u>rule1</u>, <u>rule2</u>, and so on are transformation rules.  Line breaks are significant.  The  initial  rule
       set  definition  line and the trailing ``]'' must be on separate lines; and each transformation rule must
       also be on a single line.  Transformation rules are of the form:
            <u>regular-expression</u> <b>=</b> <u>replacement</u>
       where <u>regular-expression</u> is a POSIX 1003.2 extended regular expression and <u>replacement</u> is a  string  that
       is  substituted  in  place  of  any portion of the dial string that is matched by the <u>regular-expression</u>.
       White space is significant in parsing transformation rules.   If  a  regular  expression  or  replacement
       string has embedded white space in it, then the white space needs to be escaped with a ``\'' character or
       the  entire  string  should  be  enclosed  in quote (``"'') marks.  Replacement strings may reference the
       entire string matched by the regular expression with the ``&amp;'' character.  Substrings  matched  with  the
       ``(...)''  constructs may be referenced by using ``\<u>n</u>'' where <u>n</u> is a single numeric digit between 1 and 9
       that refers to the <u>n</u>-th matched substring; c.f.  <u><a href="../man7/re_format.7.html">re_format</a></u>(7), <u><a href="../man1/sed.1.html">sed</a></u>(1), etc.

       To simplify and parameterize the construction of rule sets, dial string  rules  files  may  also  include
       simple text-oriented variable definitions.  A line of the form:
            <u>foo</u><b>=</b><u>string</u>
       defines  a variable named <u>foo</u> that has the value <u>string</u>.  String values with embedded whitespace must use
       the ``\'' character or be enclosed in quote marks.  Variables are interpolated into transformation  rules
       by referencing them as:
            <b>${</b><u>var</u><b>}</b>
       Note  that  variable interpolation is done only once, at the time a transformation rule is defined.  This
       means that forward references are not supported and that circular definitions will not cause loops.   The
       facsimile  server  automatically  defines  four variables to have the values defined in its configuration
       file: <b>AreaCode</b>, <b>CountryCode</b>, <b>LongDistancePrefix</b>, and <b>InternationalPrefix</b> These variables are  initialized
       before  parsing  a  dial  string  rules  file;  thus if they are defined in the rules file then they will
       override any definition by the server.

       There are three well known rule set names: <u>CanonicalNumber</u> to  convert  a  dial  string  to  a  canonical
       format,  <u>DialString</u>  to prepare a dial string before using it to dial the telephone, and <u>DisplayNumber</u> to
       convert a dial string to an external ``displayable'' form that does not include the  private  information
       that might appear in the raw dial string.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This is the default set of rules for transforming a dial string into a canonical phone number:
              Area=${AreaCode}                  ! local area code
              Country=${CountryCode}            ! local country code
              IDPrefix=${InternationalPrefix}   ! prefix for placing an international call
              LDPrefix=${LongDistancePrefix}    ! prefix for placing a long distance call
              !
              ! Convert a phone number to a canonical format:
              !
              !    +&lt;country&gt;&lt;areacode&gt;&lt;rest&gt;
              !
              ! by (possibly) stripping off leading dialing prefixes for
              ! long distance and/or international dialing.
              !
              CanonicalNumber := [
              %.*               =                          ! strip calling card stuff
              [abcABC]          = 2                        ! these convert alpha to numbers
              [defDEF]          = 3
              [ghiGHI]          = 4
              [jklJKL]          = 5
              [mnoMNO]          = 6
              [prsPRS]          = 7
              [tuvTUV]          = 8
              [wxyWXY]          = 9
              [^+0-9]+          =                          ! strip white space etc.
              ^${IDPrefix}      = +                        ! replace int. dialing code
              ^${LDPrefix}      = +${Country}              ! replace l.d. dialing code
              ^[^+]             = +${Country}${Area}&amp;      ! otherwise, insert canon form
              ]
       The  first  rule  simply  strips  anything  following  a ``%''; this will remove any calling card-related
       information.  The next eight rules convert upper and lower case alphabetics to the equivalent key numbers
       (this is convenient for users that use mnemonic phone numbers).  The tenth rule  removes  everything  but
       numbers  and plus signs.  The eleventh rule translates any explicit international dialing prefix into the
       ``+'' symbol used to identify country codes.  The twelfth rule replaces a leading long  distance  dialing
       prefix  with  the  local  country code string.  The last rule matches local phone numbers and inserts the
       local country code and area code.

       As an example, assume that
              AreaCode=415
              CountryCode=1
              InternationalPrefix=011
              LongDistancePrefix=1
       then if the above set of rules is applied to ``01123965-Tube%2345'', the transformations would be:
              01123965-Tube%2345    01123965-Tube    ! strip calling card stuff
              01123965-Tube         01123965-8823    ! convert alphabetics
              01123965-8823         011239658823     ! strip white space etc.
              011239658823          +239658823       ! replace int. dialing code
              +239658823            +239658823       ! replace l.d. dialing code
              +239658823            +239658823       ! otherwise, insert canon form
       for a final result of ``+239658823''.
