       tasks.cfg - Task definitions for the xymonlaunch utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>~xymon/server/etc/tasks.cfg</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  tasks.cfg  file  holds the list of tasks that xymonlaunch runs to perform all of the tasks needed by
       the Xymon monitor.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       A task is defined by a <b>key</b>, a <b>command</b>, and optionally also <b>interval</b>, <b>environment</b>, and <b>logfile</b>.

       Blank lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are treated as comments and ignored.  Long lines  can
       be broken up by putting a backslash at the end of the line and continuing the entry on the next line.

       An entry looks like this:

           [xymond]
                 ENVFILE /usr/local/xymon/server/etc/xymonserver.cfg
                 CMD /usr/local/xymon/server/bin/xymond

           [updateweb]
                 ENVFILE /usr/local/xymon/server/etc/xymonserver.cfg
                 CMD /usr/local/xymon/server/bin/xymongen
                 NEEDS xymond
                 GROUP webupdates
                 INTERVAL 5m
                 ONHOST localhost
                 MAXTIME 10m
                 LOGFILE /var/log/xymon/updateweb.log

           [monthlyreport]
                 ENVFILE /usr/local/xymon/server/etc/xymonserver.cfg
                 CMD /usr/local/xymon/server/ext/monthlyreport.sh
                 CRONDATE 30 4 1 * *

       The <b>key</b> is enclosed in angle brackets, and must be unique for each task. You can choose your key-names as
       you like, they are only used internally in xymonlaunch to identify each task.

       The <b>command</b> is defined by the <b>CMD</b> keyword. This is the full command including any options you want to use
       for this task. This is required for all tasks.

       The  <b>DISABLED</b>  keyword  means that this command is disabled.  xymonlaunch will not start this task. It is
       recommended that you use this to disable standard tasks, instead of removing them or commenting them out.
       Upgrades to Xymon will add standard tasks back into the file, so unless you have them listed as  DISABLED
       then tasks may re-appear unexpectedly after an upgrade. There is also a corresponding <b>ENABLED</b> keyword, to
       explicitly enable a task.

       The  <b>ONHOST</b>  keyword tells xymonlaunch that this task should only run on specific hosts. After the ONHOST
       keyword, you must provide a "regular expression"; if the hostname where  xymonlaunch  runs  matches  this
       expression, then the task will run. If it doesn't match, then the task is treated as if it were DISABLED.

       The  <b>MAXTIME</b>  keyword  sets  a maximum time that the task may run; if exceeded, xymonlaunch will kill the
       task. The time is in seconds by default, you can specify minutes, hours or days by adding an "m", "h"  or
       "d" after the number. By default there is no upper limit on how long a taskmay run.

       The  <b>NEEDS</b>  instructs  xymonlaunch  not  to run this task unless the task defined by the NEEDS keyword is
       already running. This is used e.g. to delay the start of some application until the needed  daemons  have
       been started. The task that must be running is defined by its <b>key</b>.

       The  <b>GROUP</b>  keyword can be used to limit the number of tasks that may run simultaneously. E.g. if you are
       generating multiple pagesets of webpages, you don't want them to run at the same time.  Putting them into
       a GROUP will cause xymonlaunch to delay the start of new tasks, so that only one task will run per group.
       You can change the limit by defining the group before the tasks, with a "GROUP groupname maxtasks" line.

       The <b>INTERVAL</b> keyword defines how often this command is executed. The example shows a  command  that  runs
       every  5 minutes.  If no interval is given, the task is only run once - this is useful for tasks that run
       continually as daemons - although if the task stops for some reason, then  xymonlaunch  will  attempt  to
       restart  it.  Intervals can be specified in seconds (if you just put a number there), or in minutes (5m),
       hours (2h), or days (1d).

       The <b>CRONDATE</b> keyword is used for tasks that must run at regular intervals or at a specific time. The time
       specification is identical to the one used by cron in <u><a href="../man5/crontab.5.html">crontab</a>(5)</u> entries, i.e. a sequence of numbers  for
       minute,  hour, day-of-month, month and day-of-week. Three-letter abbreviations in english can be used for
       the month and day-of-week fields. An asterisk is a wildcard. So in the example above, this job would  run
       once a month, at 4:30 AM on the 1st day of the month.

       The  <b>ENVFILE</b> setting points to a file with definitions of environment variables. Before running the task,
       xymonlaunch will setup all of the environment variables listed in this file.  Since this  is  a  per-task
       setting,  you  can  use  the same xymonlaunch instance to run e.g. both the server- and client-side Xymon
       tasks. If this option is not present, then the environment defined to xymonlaunch is used.

       The <b>ENVAREA</b> setting modifies which environment variables are loaded, by picking  up  the  ones  that  are
       defined for this specific "area". See <u><a href="../man5/xymonserver.cfg.5.html">xymonserver.cfg</a>(5)</u> for information about environment areas.

       The  <b>LOGFILE</b>  setting  defines  a  logfile for the task.  xymonlaunch will start the task with stdout and
       stderr redirected to this file. If this option is not present, then the output goes to the same  location
       as the xymonlaunch output.
