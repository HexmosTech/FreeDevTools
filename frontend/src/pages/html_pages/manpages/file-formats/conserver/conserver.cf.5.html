</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       conserver.cf - console configuration file for <b><a href="../man8/conserver.8.html">conserver</a></b>(8)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  format  of  the  conserver.cf  file is made up of named blocks of keyword/value pairs, comments, and
       optional whitespace for formatting flexibility.  The block types as well as the keywords are  pre-defined
       and  explained  in the <b>BLOCKS</b> section.  A comment is an unquoted pound-sign to a newline.  See the <b>PARSER</b>
       section for full details on whitespace and quoting.

       Let me first show you a sample block with a couple of keyword/value pairs to make the description  a  bit
       simpler to understand.

              console simple { master localhost; type exec; rw *; }

       This  is  actually  a  fully functional conserver.cf file (if certain conditions are met...and if you can
       list those conditions, you can probably can skip to the <b>BLOCKS</b> section).

       Our example is made of up of a console-block named ``simple'' with three keyword/value pairs.  What  this
       does is define a console named ``simple'', makes the master of that console the host ``localhost'', makes
       the  type  an exec-style console, and gives every user read/write permission.  This is the generic format
       of the file:

              block-type block-name { keyword value; ... }

       To show the addition of comments and whitespace,  here  is  the  example  reformatted  (but  functionally
       equivalent):

              # define a console named "simple"
              console simple {
                  # setting all required values...
                  master localhost;
                  type exec;  # exec-style console
                  rw *;       # allow any username
              }

</pre><h4><b>PARSER</b></h4><pre>
       The  parser  has six characters that it considers special.  These are: ``{'', ``}'', ``;'', ``#'', ``\'',
       and ``"''.  The first three (hereby called tokens) define the format of the configuration blocks and  are
       used as word separators, the next is the comment character, and the last two are quoting characters.

       Word  separation  occurs  when the parser encounters an unquoted token and, in certain cases, whitespace.
       Whitespace is only used as a word separator when the parser is looking for a block-type or keyword.  When
       it's looking for a block-name or value, whitespace is like any other character, which allows you to embed
       whitespace in a block-name or value without having to quote it.  Here is an example:

              default my defs { rw *; include other defs  ; }

       The block-type is ``default'', the block-name is ``my defs'', and the value for the  keyword  ``include''
       is  ``other  defs''.   Whitespace  around tokens are ignored so you get ``other defs'' instead of ``other
       defs  '' as the value.

       The only way to use one of the special characters as part of a block-name or value is to quote it.

       Quoting is a simple matter of prefixing a character with a backslash or surrounding a group of characters
       with double-quotes.  If a character is prefixed by a backslash, the  next  character  is  a  literal  (so
       ``\\''  produces  a  ``\'',  ``\"''  produces  ``"'',  ``\{'' produces a ``{'', etc.).  For double-quoted
       strings, all characters are literal except for ``\"'', which embeds a double-quote.

       Adding a variety of quotes to our example without changing the meaning of things, we have:

              "defa"ult my\ defs { rw *; in\clude "other defs"  ; }

       There is one special line the parser recognizes: a ``#include'' statement.  It is of the form:

              <b>#include</b> <u>filename</u>

       Any whitespace around <u>filename</u> is ignored, but whitespace embedded inside is  preserved.   Everything  in
       <u>filename</u>  is  taken  literally, so none of the normal parser quoting applies.  The <b>#include</b> must begin in
       ``column 0'' - no whitespace is allowed between it and the start of  the  physical  line.   There  is  an
       include file depth limit of 10 to prevent infinite recursion.

</pre><h4><b>BLOCKS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>access</b> <u>hostname</u>|<u>ipaddr</u>
              Define  an  access block for the host named <u>hostname</u> or using the address <u>ipaddr</u>.  If the value of
              ``*'' is used, the access block will be applied to all conserver hosts.  Access lists are used  in
              a first match fashion (top down), so order is important.

              <b>admin</b> [<b>!</b>]<u>username</u>[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     Define  a  list  of  users  making  up  the admin list for the console server.  If <u>username</u>
                     matches a previously defined group name, all members of the previous group are  applied  to
                     the  admin list (with access reversed if prefixed with a `!').  If <u>username</u> doesn't match a
                     previously defined group and <u>username</u> begins with `@', the name (minus the `@') is  checked
                     against  the  host's  group  database.   All  users  found in the group will be granted (or
                     denied, if prefixed with `!') access.  If <u>username</u>  doesn't  match  a  previous  group  and
                     doesn't begin with `@', the users will be granted (or denied, if prefixed with `!') access.
                     If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used, any users previously defined for the console servers's
                     admin list are removed.

              <b>allowed</b> <u>hostname</u>[<b>,</b>...]
                     The  list of hostnames are added to the ``allowed'' list, which grants connections from the
                     hosts but requires username authentication.

              <b>include</b> <u>accessgroup</u>
                     The access lists defined using the name <u>accessgroup</u>  are  applied  to  the  current  access
                     block.  The included access block must be previously defined.

              <b>limited</b> [<b>!</b>]<u>username</u>[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     Define  a list of users with limited functionality on the console server.  These users will
                     not be allowed to suspend their connection, shift to another console, or attach to a  local
                     command.   If <u>username</u> matches a previously defined group name, all members of the previous
                     group are applied to the admin list (with access reversed if  prefixed  with  a  `!').   If
                     <u>username</u>  doesn't  match  a previously defined group and <u>username</u> begins with `@', the name
                     (minus the `@') is checked against the host's group database.  All users found in the group
                     will be granted (or denied, if prefixed with `!') access.   If  <u>username</u>  doesn't  match  a
                     previous  group  and  doesn't  begin  with  `@',  the  users will be granted (or denied, if
                     prefixed with `!') access.  If the null string  (``<b>""</b>'')  is  used,  any  users  previously
                     defined for the console server's limited list are removed.

              <b>rejected</b> <u>hostname</u>[<b>,</b>...]
                     The  list  of  hostnames are added to the ``rejected'' list, which rejects connections from
                     the hosts.

              <b>trusted</b> <u>hostname</u>[<b>,</b>...]
                     The list of hostnames are added to the ``trusted'' list, which grants connections from  the
                     hosts without username authentication.

       <b>break</b> <u>n</u>
              Define  a  break  sequence where (1 &lt;= <u>n</u> &lt;= 9) or (a &lt;= <u>n</u> &lt;= z).  Break sequences are accessed via
              the ``^Ecl<u>n</u>'' client escape sequence.

              <b>confirm</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>true</b>|<b>on</b>|<b>no</b>|<b>false</b>|<b>off</b>
                     Set whether or not to ask the client for confirmation before sending  the  break  sequence.
                     The default is ``no''.

              <b>delay</b> <u>n</u>
                     Set the time delay for the <b>\d</b> sequence to <u>n</u> milliseconds.  The default time delay is 250ms.

              <b>string</b> <u>breakseq</u>
                     Assign the string <u>breakseq</u> to the specified slot <u>n</u>.  A break sequence is a simple character
                     string with the exception of `\' and `^':

                            <b>\a</b>    alert
                            <b>\b</b>    backspace
                            <b>\d</b>    delay specified by the <b>delay</b> option.
                            <b>\f</b>    form-feed
                            <b>\n</b>    newline
                            <b>\r</b>    carriage-return
                            <b>\t</b>    tab
                            <b>\v</b>    vertical-tab
                            <b>\z</b>    serial break
                            <b>\\</b>    backslash
                            <b>\^</b>    circumflex
                            <b>\</b><u>ooo</u>  octal representation of a character (where <u>ooo</u> is one to three octal digits)
                            <b>\</b><u>c</u>    character <u>c</u>
                            <b>^?</b>    delete
                            <b>^</b><u>c</u>    control character (<u>c</u> is ``and''ed with 0x1f)

       <b>config</b> <u>hostname</u>|<u>ipaddr</u>
              Define  a  configuration  block  for  the host named <u>hostname</u> or using the address <u>ipaddr</u>.  If the
              value of ``*'' is used, the configuration block will be applied to all conserver hosts.

              <b>autocomplete</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>true</b>|<b>on</b>|<b>no</b>|<b>false</b>|<b>off</b>
                     Turn the console name autocompletion feature on or off.  If autocompletion is on, a  client
                     can  use  any  unique  leading  portion  of  a  console  name when connecting to a console.
                     Autocompletion is on by default.

              <b>defaultaccess</b> <b>rejected</b>|<b>trusted</b>|<b>allowed</b>
                     Set the default access permission for all hosts not matched by an access list (see  the  <b>-a</b>
                     command-line flag).

              <b>daemonmode</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>true</b>|<b>on</b>|<b>no</b>|<b>false</b>|<b>off</b>
                     Set whether or not to become a daemon when run (see the <b>-d</b> command-line flag).

              <b>initdelay</b> <u>number</u>
                     Set the number of seconds between console initializations.  All consoles with the same <b>host</b>
                     value  will  be  throttled as a group (those without a <b>host</b> value are their own group).  In
                     other words, each console within a group will only  be  initialized  after  <u>number</u>  seconds
                     passes  from  the  previous  initialization of a console in that group.  Different throttle
                     groups are initialized simultaneously.  One  warning:  since  consoles  are  split  up  and
                     managed  by seperate conserver processes, it's possible for more than one conserver process
                     to have a throttle group based on a particular <b>host</b> value.  If this happens, each conserver
                     process will throttle their groups independently of the other  conserver  processes,  which
                     results  in  a  more rapid initialization (per <b>host</b> value) than one might otherwise expect.
                     If <u>number</u> is zero, all consoles are initialized without delay.

              <b>logfile</b> <u>filename</u>
                     Set the logfile to write to when in daemon mode (see the <b>-L</b> command-line flag).

              <b>passwdfile</b> <u>filename</u>
                     Set the password file location used for authentication (see the <b>-P</b> command-line flag).

              <b>primaryport</b> <u>number</u>|<u>name</u>
                     Set the port used by the master conserver process (see the <b>-p</b> command-line flag).

              <b>redirect</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>true</b>|<b>on</b>|<b>no</b>|<b>false</b>|<b>off</b>
                     Turn redirection on or off (see the <b>-R</b> command-line flag).

              <b>reinitcheck</b> <u>number</u>
                     Set the number of minutes used between reinitialization checks  (see  the  <b>-O</b>  command-line
                     flag).

              <b>secondaryport</b> <u>number</u>|<u>name</u>
                     Set the base port number used by child processes (see the <b>-b</b> command-line flag).

              <b>setproctitle</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>true</b>|<b>on</b>|<b>no</b>|<b>false</b>|<b>off</b>
                     Set  whether  or not the process title shows master/group functionality as well as the port
                     number the process is listening on and how many consoles it  is  managing.   The  operating
                     system must support the <b>setproctitle</b>() call.

              <b>sslcredentials</b> <u>filename</u>
                     Set the SSL credentials file location (see the <b>-c</b> command-line flag).

              <b>sslcacertificatefile</b> <u>filename</u>
                     Load  the  valid  CA  certificates  for the SSL connection from the PEM encoded file.  This
                     option overrides the global CA list.

              <b>sslreqclientcert</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>true</b>|<b>on</b>|<b>no</b>|<b>false</b>|<b>off</b>
                     Set whether or not a certificate is required by the client  to  connect.   The  default  is
                     ``no''.

              <b>sslrequired</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>true</b>|<b>on</b>|<b>no</b>|<b>false</b>|<b>off</b>
                     Set  whether or not encryption is required when talking to clients (see the <b>-E</b> command-line
                     flag).

              <b>unifiedlog</b> <u>filename</u>
                     Set the location of the unified log to <u>filename</u>.  See the <b>-U</b> command-line flag for details.

       <b>console</b> <u>name</u>
              Define a console identified as <u>name</u>.  The keywords are the same as  the  <b>default</b>  block  with  the
              following addition.

              <b>aliases</b> <u>name</u>[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     Define  a  list  of  console  aliases.   If  the  null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used, any aliases
                     previously defined for the console are removed.

       <b>default</b> <u>name</u>
              Define a block of defaults identified as <u>name</u>.   If  <u>name</u>  is  ``*'',  the  automatically  applied
              default  block  is  defined  (basically  all  consoles  have  an  implicit ``include "*";'' at the
              beginning of their definition).

              <b>baud</b> <b>300</b>|<b>600</b>|<b>1800</b>|<b>2400</b>|<b>4800</b>|<b>9600</b>|<b>19200</b>|<b>38400</b>|<b>57600</b>|<b>115200</b>|..|<b>4000000</b>
                     Assign the baud rate to the console.  Only consoles of type ``device'' will use this value.

              <b>break</b> <u>n</u>
                     Assign the break sequence <u>n</u> as the default for the console, which is used by the  ``^Ecl0''
                     client escape sequence.

              <b>breaklist</b> <u>n</u>[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     Associate  a  list  of  break sequences referenced by <u>n</u> with the console.  If ``*'' is used
                     (the default), all defined break sequences will be available.  If the null string  (``<b>""</b>'')
                     is used, no sequences will be available.

              <b>device</b> <u>filename</u>
                     Assign  the  serial  device  <u>filename</u>  as  the  path to the console.  Only consoles of type
                     ``device'' will use this value.

              <b>devicesubst</b> <u>c</u><b>=</b><u>t</u>[<u>n</u>]<u>f</u>[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     Perform character substitutions on the <b>device</b> value.   A  series  of  replacements  can  be
                     defined  by specifying a comma-separated list of <u>c</u>=<u>t</u>[<u>n</u>]<u>f</u> sequences where <u>c</u> is any printable
                     character, <u>t</u> specifies the replacement value, <u>n</u> is a field length (optional), and <u>f</u> is  the
                     format  string.   <u>t</u> can be one of the characters below, catagorized as a string replacement
                     or a numeric replacement, which dictates the use of the <u>n</u> and <u>f</u> fields.

                            String Replacement
                            <b>c</b>      console name
                            <b>h</b>      <b>host</b> value
                            <b>r</b>      <b>replstring</b> value

                            Numeric Replacement
                            <b>b</b>      <b>baud</b> value
                            <b>p</b>      config <b>port</b> value
                            <b>P</b>      calculated port value

                     For string replacements, if the replacement isn't at least <u>n</u> characters, it will be  padded
                     with  space  characters  on  the left.  <u>f</u> must be `s'.  For numeric replacements, the value
                     will be formatted to at least <u>n</u> characters, padded with 0s if <u>n</u> begins with a 0, and  space
                     characters  otherwise.   <u>f</u> must be either `d', `x', `X', `a', or `A', specifying a decimal,
                     lowercase hexadecimal (0-9a-f),  uppercase  hexadecimal  (0-9A-F),  lowercase  alphanumeric
                     (0-9a-z),  or  uppercase  alphanumeric (0-9A-Z) conversion.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is
                     used, no replacements will be done.

              <b>exec</b> <u>command|</u><b>""</b>
                     Assign the string <u>command</u> as the command to access the console.   Conserver  will  run  the
                     command  by  invoking ``<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> -ce "<u>command</u>"''.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used or no
                     <b>exec</b> keyword is specified, conserver will use the command ``<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> -i''.  Only consoles of
                     type ``exec'' will use this value.

              <b>execrunas</b> [<u>user</u>][:<u>group</u>]|<b>""</b>
                     By default, the command invoked by <b>exec</b> is run with the same privileges as the server.   If
                     the server is running with root privileges, this option resets the user and/or group of the
                     invoked  process to <u>user</u> and <u>group</u> respectively.  <u>user</u> may be a username or numeric uid and
                     <u>group</u> may be a group name or numeric gid.  Either one is optional.  If the  server  is  not
                     running  with  root  privileges, these values are not used.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is
                     specified, the default of running with the same privileges as the server is restored.

              <b>execsubst</b> <u>c</u><b>=</b><u>t</u>[<u>n</u>]<u>f</u>[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     Perform character substitutions on the <b>exec</b> value.   See  the  <b>devicesubst</b>  option  for  an
                     explanation  of  the  format  string.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used, no replacements
                     will be done.

              <b>host</b> <u>hostname</u>
                     Assign <u>hostname</u> as the host to connect to for accessing the console.  You must also set the
                     <b>port</b> option for consoles of type ``host''.  Normally, only consoles of  type  ``host''  and
                     ``ipmi''  will use this value, however if the <b>devicesubst</b>, <b>execsubst</b>, or <b>initsubst</b> keywords
                     are used in any console type, this value is used.

              <b>idlestring</b> <u>string</u>|<b>""</b>
                     Assign the <u>string</u> that is sent to the console once the console is idle for  an  <u>idletimeout</u>
                     amount  of  time.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used, the string is unset and the default
                     is used.  The string is interpreted just as a <b>break</b> string is interpreted  (see  the  <b>break</b>
                     configuration  items  for  details) where all delays specified (via ``\d'') use the default
                     delay time.  The default string is ``\n''.

              <b>idletimeout</b> <u>number</u>[<b>s</b>|<b>m</b>|<b>h</b>]
                     Set the idle timeout of the console to <u>number</u> seconds.  If an `s',  `m',  or  `h'  is  used
                     after  <u>number</u>,  the  specified  time is interpreted as seconds, minutes, or hours.  Set the
                     timeout to zero to disable the idle timeout (the default).

              <b>ipmiciphersuite</b> <u>number</u>
                     Set the IPMI cipher suite.  Syntactically valid values are -1 (the  default)  and  greater.
                     Check the FreeIPMI documentation for usable values.

              <b>ipmikg</b> <u>string</u>|<b>""</b>
                     Set  the  BMC  authentication  key K_g to <u>string</u>.  A K_g value is a simple character string
                     with the exception of `\':

                            <b>\\</b>    backslash
                            <b>\</b><u>ooo</u>  octal representation of a character (where <u>ooo</u> is one to three octal digits)
                            <b>\</b><u>c</u>    character <u>c</u>

                     The resulting value must be no more than 20 characters.  The null string  (``<b>""</b>'')  is  the
                     default.

              <b>ipmiworkaround</b> [<b>!</b>]option[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     You can turn off a workaround by prefixing it with a ``<b>!</b>''  character.  So, to turn off the
                     <b>integrity</b>  workaround, you would use <b>!integrity</b>.  The following are valid <u>option</u>s and their

                     If no <b>ipmiworkaround</b> is specified, the ``<b>default</b>''  workaround  will  be  used.   The  null
                     string   (``<b>""</b>'')   unsets  all  workarounds,  including  ``<b>default</b>''.   See  the  FreeIPMI

              <b>ipmiprivlevel</b> <u>user</u>|<u>operator</u>|<u>admin</u>
                     Set the privilege level for the username used  during  IPMI  authentication.   The  default
                     privilege level is ``<u>admin</u>''.

              <b>include</b> <u>default</u>
                     The  default  block  defined  using  the  name <u>default</u> is applied to the current console or
                     default block.  The included default block must be previously defined.

              <b>initcmd</b> <u>command</u>|<b>""</b>
                     Invoke <u>command</u> as soon as the console is brought up,  redirecting  the  console  to  stdin,

                     If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used, the command is unset and nothing is invoked.

              <b>initrunas</b> [<u>user</u>][:<u>group</u>]|<b>""</b>
                     By default, the command invoked by <b>initcmd</b> is run with the same privileges as  the  server.
                     If  the server is running with root privileges, this option resets the user and/or group of
                     the invoked process to <u>user</u> and <u>group</u> respectively.  <u>user</u> may be a username or numeric  uid
                     and  <u>group</u>  may  be a group name or numeric gid.  Either one is optional.  If the server is
                     not running with root privileges, these values are not used.  If the null  string  (``<b>""</b>'')
                     is specified, the default of running with the same privileges as the server is restored.

              <b>initspinmax</b> <u>n</u>|<b>""</b>
                     Set  the  maximum number of ``spins'' allowed for the console to <u>n</u>, where 0 &lt;= <u>n</u> &lt;= 254.  A
                     console is determined to be ``spinning'' if an attempt to initialize the console occurs  in
                     under  <b>initspintimer</b> seconds from its previous initialization and this quick initialization
                     occurs <b>initspinmax</b> times in a row.  If, at any point, the time between  initializations  is
                     greater  than  <b>initspintimer</b>,  the counter for reaching <b>initspinmax</b> resets to zero.  When a
                     console is determined to be ``spinning'' it is forced down.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is
                     specified, the default of <b>5</b> is used.

              <b>initspintimer</b> <u>t</u>|<b>""</b>
                     Set the number of seconds a console must be ``up'' to not be considered ``spinning'' to  <u>t</u>,
                     where  0  &lt;= <u>t</u> &lt;= 254.  See <b>initspinmax</b> for a full description of console ``spinning.''  If
                     the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is specified, the default of <b>1</b> is used.

              <b>initsubst</b> <u>c</u><b>=</b><u>t</u>[<u>n</u>]<u>f</u>[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     Perform character substitutions on the <b>initcmd</b> value.  See the <b>devicesubst</b>  option  for  an
                     explanation  of  the  format  string.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used, no replacements
                     will be done.

              <b>logfile</b> <u>filename</u>|<b>""</b>
                     Assign the logfile specified by <u>filename</u> to  the  console.   Any  occurrence  of  ``&amp;''  in
                     <u>filename</u>  will  be  replaced  with the name of the console.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is
                     used, the logfile name is unset and no logging will occur.

              <b>logfilemax</b> <u>number</u>[<b>k</b>|<b>m</b>]
                     Enable automatic rotation of <b>logfile</b> once its size exceeds <u>number</u> bytes.  Specifying <b>k</b> or <b>m</b>
                     interpret <u>number</u> as kilobytes and megabytes.  <u>number</u> must be at least 2048 bytes.  A  value
                     of  zero will turn off automatic rotation of <b>logfile</b>.  The <b>logfile</b> <u>filename</u> will be renamed
                     <u>filename</u>-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS, where the extension is the current GMT year,  month,  day,  hour,
                     minute,  and second (to prevent issues with clock rollbacks).  File sizes are checked every
                     5 minutes with an additional initial pseudo-random delay of  up  to  one  minute  (to  help
                     prevent  all  processes  checking  all  consoles simultaneously).  2.5% (minimum 100 bytes,
                     maximum 4000 bytes) of the old logfile is read from the end of the file.  All data past the
                     first newline is moved (not copied) to the new logfile so that  a  replay  of  the  console
                     works and starts on a line boundary.

              <b>master</b> <u>hostname</u>|<u>ipaddr</u>
                     Define  which conserver host manages the console.  The host may be specified by <u>hostname</u> or
                     using the address <u>ipaddr</u>.

              <b>motd</b> <u>message</u>|<b>""</b>
                     Set the "message of the day" for the console to <u>message</u>, which gets displayed when a client
                     attaches to the console.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used, the MOTD  is  unset  and  no
                     message will occur.

              <b>options</b> [<b>!</b>]option[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     You  can  negate  the  option by prefixing it with a ``<b>!</b>''  character.  So, to turn off the
                     <b>hupcl</b> flag, you would use <b>!hupcl</b>.  The following are valid <u>option</u>s:

                     <b>ixon</b>        Enable XON/XOFF flow control on output.  Only consoles of  type  ``device''  or

                     <b>ixany</b>       Enable  any  character  to restart output.  Only consoles of type ``device'' or
                                 ``exec'' will use this value.  Default is <b>!ixany</b>.
                     <b>ixoff</b>       Enable XON/XOFF flow control on input.  Only consoles  of  type  ``device''  or

                                 and <b>!ixoff</b> for consoles of type ``exec''.
                     <b>crtscts</b>     Enable  RTS/CTS (hardware) flow control.  Only consoles of type ``device'' will

                     <b>cstopb</b>      Set two stop bits, rather than one.  Only consoles of type ``device'' will  use
                                 this value.  Default is <b>!cstopb</b>.
                     <b>hupcl</b>       Lower modem control lines after last process closes the device (hang up).  Only
                                 consoles of type ``device'' will use this value.  Default is <b>!hupcl</b>.
                     <b>ondemand</b>    Initialize  the  console  when  a  client requests a connection to the console.
                                 When no clients are connected, bring the console down.  The conserver option <b>-i</b>
                                 will set this flag for all consoles.  Default is <b>!ondemand</b>.

                                 will set this flag for all consoles.  Default is <b>!striphigh</b>.
                     <b>reinitoncc</b>  Automatically reinitialize (``bring  up'')  a  downed  console  when  a  client
                                 connects.  Without this option, a client will be attached to the downed console
                                 and  will  need  to  manually reinitialize the console with an escape sequence.
                                 The conserver option <b>-o</b> will set  this  flag  for  all  consoles.   Default  is

                     <b>autoreinit</b>  Allow  this  console  to be automatically reinitialized if it unexpectedly goes
                                 down.  If the console doesn't come back up, it  is  retried  every  minute.   A
                                 console  of  type  ``exec'' that exits with a zero exit status is automatically
                                 reinitialized regardless of this setting.  The conserver option <b>-F</b>  will  <b>unset</b>
                                 this flag for all consoles.  Default is <b>autoreinit</b>.
                     <b>unloved</b>     Enable  the  sending  of  this console's output (prefixed with its name) to the
                                 daemon's stdout (or the  logfile  if  in  daemon  mode)  when  no  clients  are
                                 connected  to  the console.  The conserver option <b>-u</b> will set this flag for all
                                 consoles.  Default is <b>!unloved</b>.
                     <b>login</b>       Allow users to log into this console.  If logins  are  not  allowed,  conserver
                                 will  send  a  generic  message  to  the  client  saying  so  and terminate the
                                 connection.  You can override the generic message by setting the <b>motd</b>  message.
                                 Default is <b>login</b>.

              <b>parity</b> <b>even</b>|<b>mark</b>|<b>none</b>|<b>odd</b>|<b>space</b>
                     Set  the  parity  option  for  the console.  Only consoles of type ``device'' will use this
                     value.

              <b>password</b> <u>password</u>|<b>""</b>
                     Use <u>password</u> during IPMI  authentication.   If  the  null  string  (``<b>""</b>'')  is  used  (the
                     default), no password will be used.

              <b>port</b> <u>number</u>|<u>name</u>
                     Set  the port used to access the console.  The port may be specified as a <u>number</u> or a <u>name</u>.
                     A <u>name</u> will cause a <b><a href="../man3/getservbyname.3.html">getservbyname</a></b>(3) call to look up the port number.  The <b>port</b>,  <b>portbase</b>,
                     and  <b>portinc</b>  values  are  all  used to calculate the final port number to connect to.  The
                     formula used is <u>finalport</u> = <b>portbase</b> + <b>portinc</b> * <b>port</b>.   By  using  proper  values  in  the
                     formula,  you  can reference ports on a terminal server by their physical numbering of 0..<u>n</u>
                     or 1..<u>n</u> (depending on if you like zero-based or one-based  numbering).   Warning:  you  can
                     generate  a  -1  value  with  this formula, which will become a very high numbered positive
                     value (since things are stored unsigned).  You must also  set  the  <b>host</b>  option  as  well.
                     Normally,  only  consoles of type ``host'' will use this value, however if the <b>devicesubst</b>,
                     <b>execsubst</b>, or <b>initsubst</b> keywords are used in any console type, this value is used.

              <b>portbase</b> <u>number</u>
                     Set the base value for the port calculation formula.  <u>number</u> must be  0  or  greater.   The
                     default is zero.  See <b>port</b> for the details of the formula.

              <b>portinc</b> <u>number</u>
                     Set  the  increment  value  for the port calculation formula.  <u>number</u> must be 0 or greater.
                     The default is one.  See <b>port</b> for the details of the formula.

              <b>protocol</b> <b>telnet</b>|<b>raw</b>
                     Set the protocol used to send and receive data from the console.  If <b>raw</b> is used, all  data
                     is  sent ``as is'', unprotected by any protocol specification.  If <b>telnet</b> is used (which is
                     the default), data is encapsulated in the telnet protocol.  The  <b>striphigh</b>  console  option
                     still applies when data is read by the server, and if enabled, can impact the encapsulation
                     process.

              <b>replstring</b> <u>string</u>
                     A  generic replacement string that can be used by the <b>devicesubst</b>, <b>execsubst</b>, and <b>initsubst</b>
                     keywords.

              <b>ro</b> [<b>!</b>]<u>username</u>[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     Define a list of users making up the read-only access list for the  console.   If  <u>username</u>
                     matches  a  previously defined group name, all members of the previous group are applied to
                     the read-only access list (with access reversed if  prefixed  with  a  `!').   If  <u>username</u>
                     doesn't  match a previously defined group and <u>username</u> begins with `@', the name (minus the
                     `@') is checked against the host's group database.  All users found in the  group  will  be
                     granted  (or  denied,  if prefixed with `!') read-only access.  If <u>username</u> doesn't match a
                     previous group and doesn't begin with `@',  the  users  will  be  granted  (or  denied,  if
                     prefixed  with  `!')  read-only  access.   If  the  null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used, any users
                     previously defined for the console's read-only list are removed.

              <b>rw</b> [<b>!</b>]<u>username</u>[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     Define a list of users making up the read-write access list for the console.   If  <u>username</u>
                     matches  a  previously defined group name, all members of the previous group are applied to
                     the read-write access list (with access reversed if prefixed  with  a  `!').   If  <u>username</u>
                     doesn't  match a previously defined group and <u>username</u> begins with `@', the name (minus the
                     `@') is checked against the host's group database.  All users found in the  group  will  be
                     granted  (or  denied, if prefixed with `!') read-write access.  If <u>username</u> doesn't match a
                     previous group and doesn't begin with `@',  the  users  will  be  granted  (or  denied,  if
                     prefixed  with  `!')  read-write  access.   If  the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used, any users
                     previously defined for the console's read-write list are removed.

              <b>tasklist</b> <u>c</u>[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     Associate a list of tasks referenced by  <u>c</u>  with  the  console.   If  ``*''  is  used  (the
                     default),  all  defined  tasks  will be available.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used, no
                     tasks will be available.

              <b>timestamp</b> [<u>number</u>[<b>m</b>|<b>h</b>|<b>d</b>|<b>l</b>]][<b>a</b>][<b>b</b>]|<b>""</b>
                     Specifies the time between timestamps applied to the console log file and  whether  to  log
                     read/write  connection actions.  The timestamps look like ``[-- MARK -- Mon Jan 25 14:46:56
                     1999]''.  The `<b>m</b>', `<b>h</b>', and `<b>d</b>' tags specify  ``minutes''  (the  default),  ``hours'',  and
                     ``days''.  The `<b>l</b>' tag specifies ``lines'' and will cause timestamps of the form ``[Mon Jan
                     25  14:46:56  PST  1999]'' to be placed every <u>number</u> lines (a newline character signifies a
                     new line).  So, ``5h'' specifies every five hours and ``2l'' specifies every two lines.  An
                     `<b>a</b>' can be specified to add logs of ``attached'',  ``detached'',  and  ``bumped''  actions,
                     including  the  user's  name and the host from which the client connection was made.  A `<b>b</b>'
                     can be specified to add logging of break sequences sent to the console.

              <b>type</b> <b>device</b>|<b>ipmi</b>|<b>exec</b>|<b>host</b>|<b>noop</b>|<b>uds</b>
                     Set the type of console.  A type of ``<b>device</b>'' should be used for local serial ports  (also
                     set the <b>device</b> value).  A type of ``<b>ipmi</b>'' should be used for IPMI serial over LAN consoles
                     (also set the <b>host</b> value and possibly the <b>username</b>, <b>password</b>, and <b>ipmi</b>* values).  A type of
                     ``<b>exec</b>''  should be used for command invocations (perhaps also set the <b>exec</b> value).  A type
                     of ``<b>host</b>'' should be used for terminal servers  and  other  TCP  socket-based  interaction
                     (also  set the <b>host</b> and <b>port</b> values).  A type of ``<b>noop</b>'' should be used as a placeholder -
                     it does nothing, ignores any <b>logfile</b> value and forces the <b>!nologin</b>  option  (so  you  might
                     want  to  set  the  <b>motd</b>  value).  A type of ``<b>uds</b>'' should be used for Unix domain sockets
                     (also set the <b>uds</b> option).

              <b>uds</b> <u>filename</u>
                     Assign the Unix domain socket <u>filename</u> as the path to the console.  Only consoles  of  type
                     ``uds'' will use this value.

              <b>udssubst</b> <u>c</u><b>=</b><u>t</u>[<u>n</u>]<u>f</u>[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     Perform  character  substitutions  on  the  <b>uds</b>  value.   See the <b>devicesubst</b> option for an
                     explanation of the format string.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'')  is  used,  no  replacements
                     will be done.

              <b>username</b> <u>username</u>|<b>""</b>
                     Use  <u>username</u>  during  IPMI  authentication.   If  the  null  string  (``<b>""</b>'') is used (the
                     default), the ``null'' user will be used.

       <b>group</b> <u>name</u>
              Define a user group identified as <u>name</u>.

              <b>users</b> [<b>!</b>]<u>username</u>[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     Define a list of users making up the group <u>name</u>.  If <u>username</u> matches a previously  defined
                     group name, all members of the previous group are applied to the current group (with access
                     reversed if prefixed with a `!').  If <u>username</u> doesn't match a previously defined group and
                     <u>username</u>  begins  with  `@',  the  name (minus the `@') is checked against the host's group
                     database.  All users found in the group will be recorded with (or without, if prefixed with
                     `!') access.  If <u>username</u> doesn't match a previous group and doesn't begin  with  `@',  the
                     users  will be recorded with (or without, if prefixed with `!') access.  If the null string
                     (``<b>""</b>'') is used, any users previously defined for this group are removed.

       <b>task</b> <u>c</u>
              Define a task where <u>c</u> is a lowercase alphanumeric (0-9a-z).  Tasks are invoked via  the  ``^Ec!<u>c</u>''
              client escape sequence.

              <b>cmd</b> <u>command</u>|<b>""</b>
                     Invoke  <u>command</u>  on  the  server  when  instructed by the client.  All file descriptors are
                     closed, except for stderr (which is inherited from the server).  The <u>command</u> is  passed  as
                     an  argument to ``<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> -ce'' and is a ``fire and forget'' methodology (you need to check
                     logs for any issues).  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used, the entire task  definition  is
                     ignored.

              <b>confirm</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>true</b>|<b>on</b>|<b>no</b>|<b>false</b>|<b>off</b>
                     Set  whether  or  not  to  ask  the  client for confirmation before invoking the task.  The
                     default is ``no''.

              <b>description</b> <u>string</u>
                     Set a description for the task.  When a client lists tasks, <u>string</u> will be printed  instead
                     of  the  command  defined  above.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used, the command defined
                     above will be printed.

              <b>runas</b> [<u>user</u>][:<u>group</u>]|<b>""</b>
                     By default, the command invoked by <b>cmd</b> is run with the same privileges as the  server.   If
                     the server is running with root privileges, this option resets the user and/or group of the
                     invoked  process to <u>user</u> and <u>group</u> respectively.  <u>user</u> may be a username or numeric uid and
                     <u>group</u> may be a group name or numeric gid.  Either one is optional.  If the  server  is  not
                     running  with  root  privileges, these values are not used.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is
                     specified, the default of running with the same privileges as the server is restored.

              <b>subst</b> <u>c</u><b>=</b><u>t</u>[<u>n</u>]<u>f</u>[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     Perform character substitutions on the <b>cmd</b>  value.   See  the  <b>devicesubst</b>  option  for  an
                     explanation  of  the  format  string.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used, no replacements
                     will be done.
