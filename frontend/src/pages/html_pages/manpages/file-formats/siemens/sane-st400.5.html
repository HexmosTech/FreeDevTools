</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-st400 - SANE backend for Siemens ST/Highscan flatbed scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-st400</b>  library  implements  a  SANE  (Scanner  Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
       Siemens ST400 flatbed scanners and compatibles.  At present, the following scanners are supported by this
       backend:

              Siemens ST400 (6 bit gray scale)
              Siemens ST800 (6 bit gray scale)

       The driver supports line art and gray scans up to 8bpp.

       The Siemens ST/Highscan series includes several more models, e.g. the ST300 and ST600.  If you own one of
       these scanners, or a scanner other than the ones listed above that works with this backend, please let us
       know by sending  the  scanner's  model  name,  SCSI  ID,  and  firmware  revision  to  <u>sane-devel@alioth-</u>
       <u>lists.debian.net</u>.   Have a look at <u><a href="http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html">http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html</a></u> concerning subscription
       to sane-devel.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              <u>special</u>

       Where <u>special</u> is the path-name for the special device that  corresponds  to  a  SCSI  scanner.  For  SCSI
       scanners,  the  special  device  name must be a generic SCSI device or a symlink to such a device.  Under
       Linux, such a device name could be <u>/dev/sga</u> or <u>/dev/sge</u>, for example.  See <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5) for details.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The contents of the <u>st400.conf</u> file is a list of device names that correspond to Siemens scanners.  Empty
       lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  A sample configuration file is shown below:

              /dev/scanner
              # this is a comment
              /dev/sge

       The default configuration file that is distributed with SANE looks like this:

              scsi SIEMENS "ST 400" Scanner * * 3 0

       In this configuration, the driver can only access the ST400 model at SCSI ID 3 LUN 0  (see  section  <b>BUGS</b>
       below  for  the  reason).   To  use  the driver with other scanner models, add an appropriate line to the
       configuration file.  For example, to use it with an ST800 at SCSI ID 3 LUN 0, add the line:

              scsi SIEMENS "ST 800" Scanner * * 3 0

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/st400.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file (see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-st400.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-st400.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.   On  *NIX  systems,  the  directories  are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are
              separated by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file is  searched
              in  two  default  directories: first, the current working directory (".") and then in <u>/etc/sane.d</u>.
              If the value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separator  character,  then  the
              default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being
              searched (in this order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_ST400</b>
              If  the  library  was  compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128  requests  all  debug  output  to  be  printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

</pre><h4><b>MISSING</b> <b>FUNCTIONALITY</b></h4><pre>
       Everything but the most basic stuff.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Currently,  the  backend does not check if the attached device really is a ST400.  It will happily accept
       everything that matches the configuration entries.  This makes it easy to test  the  backend  with  other
       scanners:  Just add an appropriate line to the configuration file.  The configuration file as distributed
       (see above) only works with the ST400.  Be careful: If there is  no  config  file  at  all,  the  backend
       defaults to <u>/dev/scanner</u>.

       The  ST400  answers  on  all  eight SCSI LUNs.  Normally this is not a problem, as LUN support is usually
       disabled in SCSI drivers, but if you are seeing multiple instances of  the  scanner  in  a  device  list,
       either disable LUNs in your SCSI setup or change the entry in the configuration file to match LUN 0 only.

</pre><h4><b>DEBUG</b></h4><pre>
       If  you encounter a bug please set the environment variable <b>SANE_DEBUG_ST400</b> to 128 and try to regenerate
       the problem. Then send me a report with the log attached.

       If you encounter a SCSI bus error or trimmed and/or displaced images  please  also  set  the  environment
       variable <b>SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI</b> to 128 before sending me the report.
