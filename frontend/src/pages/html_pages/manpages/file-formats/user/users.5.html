</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       users - user authorization file for the FreeRADIUS server

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>users</b> files reside in the files module configuration directory, by default <b>/etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-</b>
       <b>config/files/</b>.  It contains a series of configuration directives which are used by the  <u>files</u>  module  to
       decide how to authorize and authenticate each user request.

       Every line starting with a hash sign ('<b>#</b>') is treated as comment and ignored.

       Each entry of the file begins with a username, followed by a (possibly empty) list of check items, all on
       one line.  The next line begins with a tab, and a (possibly empty) list of reply items.  Each item in the
       check  or  reply item list is an attribute of the form <b>name</b> <b>=</b> <b>value</b>.  Multiple items may be placed on one
       line, in which case they must be separated by commas.  The reply items may  be  specified  over  multiple
       lines,  in  which case each line must end with a comma, and the last line of the reply items must not end
       with a comma.

       The check items are a list of attributes used to match the incoming request.  If  the  username  matches,
       AND  all  of  the  check  items match the incoming request, then the reply items are added to the list of
       attributes which will be used in the reply to that request.  This process is  repeated  for  all  of  the
       entries in the users file.

       If the incoming request matches NO entry, then the request is rejected.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The special keyword <b>DEFAULT</b> matches any usernames.

       The  entries  are  processed in order, from the top of the <b>users</b> file, on down.  If an entry contains the
       special item <b>Fall-Through</b> <b>=</b> <b>No</b> as a reply attribute, then the processing of the file stops, and  no  more
       entries  are  matched.   Any  reply  item list without any <b>Fall-Through</b> attribute is treated as though it
       included a <b>Fall-Through</b> <b>=</b> <b>No</b> attribute.

       If an entry contains the special item <b>Fall-Through</b> <b>=</b> <b>Yes</b>  as  a  reply  attribute,  then  the  processing
       proceeds to the next entry in order.

       Care  should  be  taken  when  using  <b>Fall-Through</b>.  The server should be tested in debugging mode with a
       number of test requests, in order to verify that the configured entries behave as expected.

       The special attribute <b>Auth-Type</b> is used to identify the authentication type to be  used  for  that  user.
       See the <b>dictionary</b> file for a list of permitted values for the <b>Auth-Type</b> attribute.

       Once  the  <b>users</b>  file  has been processed, the request is authenticated, using the method given by <b>Auth-</b>
       <b>Type</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATORS</b></h4><pre>
       Additional operators other than <b>=</b> may be used for the attributes in either the check item, or reply  item
       list.  The following is a list of operators, and their meaning.

       <b>Attribute</b> <b>=</b> <b>Value</b>
            Not  allowed as a check item for RADIUS protocol attributes.  It is allowed for server configuration
            attributes (Auth-Type, etc), and sets the value of on attribute, only if there is no other  item  of
            the same attribute.
            As a reply item, it means "add the item to the reply list, but only if there is no other item of the
            same attribute."

       <b>Attribute</b> <b>:=</b> <b>Value</b>
            Always  matches  as  a check item, and replaces in the configuration items any attribute of the same
            name.  If no attribute of that name appears in the request, then this attribute is added.
            As a reply item, it has an identical meaning, but for the reply items, instead of the request items.

       <b>Attribute</b> <b>==</b> <b>Value</b>
            As a check item, it matches if the named attribute is present in the  request,  AND  has  the  given
            value.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

       <b>Attribute</b> <b>+=</b> <b>Value</b>
            Always matches as a check item, and adds the current attribute with value to the tail of the list of
            configuration items.
            As  a  reply  item, it has an identical meaning, but the attribute is added to the tail of the reply
            items list.

       <b>Attribute</b> <b>^=</b> <b>Value</b>
            Always matches as a check item, and adds the current attribute with value to the head of the list of
            configuration items.
            As a reply item, it has an identical meaning, but the attribute is added to the head  of  the  reply
            items list.

       <b>Attribute</b> <b>!=</b> <b>Value</b>
            As  a  check  item,  matches  if  the given attribute is in the request, AND does not have the given
            value.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

       <b>Attribute</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>Value</b>
            As a check item, it matches if the request contains an attribute with a value greater than  the  one
            given.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

       <b>Attribute</b> <b>&gt;=</b> <b>Value</b>
            As a check item, it matches if the request contains an attribute with a value greater than, or equal
            to the one given.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

       <b>Attribute</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>Value</b>
            As  a  check  item,  it  matches if the request contains an attribute with a value less than the one
            given.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

       <b>Attribute</b> <b>&lt;=</b> <b>Value</b>
            As a check item, it matches if the request contains an attribute with a value less than, or equal to
            the one given.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

       <b>Attribute</b> <b>=*</b> <b>Value</b>
            As a check item, it matches if the request contains the named attribute, no matter  what  the  value
            is.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

       <b>Attribute</b> <b>!*</b> <b>Value</b>
            As  a check item, it matches if the request does not contain the named attribute, no matter what the
            value is.
            Not allowed as a reply item.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       bob  Cleartext-Password := "hello"

              Requests containing the User-Name attribute, with value "bob", will  be  authenticated  using  the
              "known good" password "hello".  There are no reply items, so the reply will be empty.

       DEFAULT Service-Type == Framed-User, Framed-Protocol == PPP
            Service-Type = Framed-User,
            Framed-Protocol = PPP,
            Fall-Through = Yes

              If  the  request  packet  contains the attributes Service-Type and Framed-Protocol, with the given
              values, then include those attributes in the reply.

              That is, give the user what they ask for.  This entry also shows how  to  specify  multiple  reply
              items.

       See the <b>users</b> file supplied with the server for more examples and comments.

</pre><h4><b>HINTS</b></h4><pre>
       Run  the  server  in debugging mode (<b>-X</b>), and use the <b>radclient</b> program to send it test packets which you
       think will match specific entries.  The server will  print  out  which  entries  were  matched  for  that
       request,  so  you  can  verify  your  expectations.  This should be the FIRST thing you do if you suspect
       problems with the file.

       Care should be taken when writing entries for the <b>users</b> file.  It is easy to misconfigure the  server  so
       that  requests  are  accepted when you wish to reject them.  The entries should be ordered, and the Fall-
       Through item should be used ONLY where it is required.

       Entries rejecting certain requests should go at the top of the file, and should not have  a  Fall-Through
       item  in their reply items.  Entries for specific users, who do not have a Fall-Through item, should come
       next.  Any DEFAULT entries should usually come last,  except  as  fall-through  entries  that  set  reply
       attributes.
