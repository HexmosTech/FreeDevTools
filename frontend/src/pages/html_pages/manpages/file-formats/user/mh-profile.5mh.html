</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mh-profile, mh_profile - user customization for nmh message handler

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Each  user  of  <b>nmh</b>  is  expected  to  have  a file named <u>.mh-profile</u> in their home directory.  This file
       contains a set of user parameters used by the <b>nmh</b> family of programs.  Each entry in the file is  of  the
       format

            <u>profile-component</u>: <u>value</u>

       If  the  text  of  a  profile entry is long, you may extend it across several real lines by indenting the
       continuation lines with leading spaces or tabs.  Comments may be introduced by a line starting with `#:':

            <u>#</u>: This is a comment.

       Blank lines are not permitted in <u>.mh-profile</u>.  Shell quoting conventions are not available; each token is
       separated by whitespace.

   <b>Standard</b> <b>Profile</b> <b>Entries</b>
       The possible profile components are exemplified below.  The only mandatory entry is `Path:'.  The  others
       are  optional;  some  have default values if they are not present.  In the notation used below, (profile,
       default) indicates whether the information is kept  in  the  user's  <b>nmh</b>  profile  or  <b>nmh</b>  context,  and
       indicates  what  the  default  value  is.   Note that a profile component can only appear once.  Multiple
       appearances will trigger a warning that all appearances after the first are ignored.

       Some MH programs, including <b>mhbuild</b>, <b>mhshow</b>, and <b>mhstore</b>,  have  specific  profile  components  that  are
       described  in their respective man pages.  Each component name specific to these programs begins with the
       name of the program and is followed by a dash.

       <b>Path</b>: Mail
            Locates <b>nmh</b> transactions in  directory  “Mail”.   A  relative  Path  starts  from  the  user's  home
            directory.  This is the only mandatory profile entry.  (profile, no default)

       <b>locale</b>: locale
            Set  the locale for all <b>nmh</b> programs except <b>post</b>, <b>install-mh</b>, and <b>slocal</b>.  See the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE,
            and LANG variables in the "ENVIRONMENT" section below for a reference on how the locale  is  set  if
            this profile component is not used.

       <b>context</b>: context
            Declares  the  location of the <b>nmh</b> context file.  This can be overridden by the environment variable
            MHCONTEXT.  See the <b>HISTORY</b> section below.  (profile, default: &lt;nmh-dir&gt;/context)

       <b>Current-Folder</b>: inbox
            Keeps track of the current open folder.  (context, default: folder specified by “Inbox”)

       <b>Inbox</b>: inbox
            Defines the name of the default inbox.  (profile, default: inbox)

       <b>Previous-Sequence</b>: <u>pseq</u>
            Names the sequence or sequences which should be defined as the `msgs' or `msg' argument given to any
            <b>nmh</b> command.  If not present or empty, no such sequences are  defined.   Otherwise,  for  each  name
            given,  the  sequence  is  first  zeroed  and  then  each  message  is  added to the sequence.  Read
            <u><a href="../man5/mh-sequence.5.html">mh-sequence</a></u>(5) for the details about this sequence.  (profile, no default)

       <b>Sequence-Negation</b>: not
            Defines the string which, when prefixed to a sequence name, negates that sequence.  Hence, “notseen”
            means all those messages that are not a member of the sequence “seen”.  Read <u><a href="../man5/mh-sequence.5.html">mh-sequence</a></u>(5) for  the
            details.  (profile, no default)

       <b>Unseen-Sequence</b>: unseen
            Names  the  sequence  or  sequences which should be defined as those messages which are unread.  The
            commands <b>inc</b>, <b>rcvstore</b>, <b>mhshow</b>, and <b>show</b> will add or remove messages from these sequences when  they
            are  incorporated or read.  If not present or empty, no such sequences are defined.  Otherwise, each
            message is added to, or removed from, each sequence name given.  Read <u><a href="../man5/mh-sequence.5.html">mh-sequence</a></u>(5) for the details
            about this sequence.  (profile, no default)

       <b>mh-sequences</b>: .mh-sequences
            The name of the file in each folder which defines public sequences.  To disable the  use  of  public
            sequences, leave the value portion of this entry blank.  (profile, default: .mh-sequences)

       <b>atr-</b><u>seq</u><b>-</b><u>folder</u><b>:</b> 172 178-181 212
            Keeps  track  of  the  private sequence called “seq” in the specified folder.  Private sequences are
            generally used for read-only folders.  See  <u><a href="../man5/mh-sequence.5.html">mh-sequence</a></u>(5)  for  details  about  private  sequences.
            (context, no default)

       <b>Editor</b>: prompter
            Defines  the  editor  to  be used by the commands <b>comp</b>, <b>dist</b>, <b>forw</b>, and <b>repl</b>.  If not set, the value
            will be taken from the VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables.  (profile, default: prompter)

       <b>Msg-Protect</b>: 600
            An octal number which defines the permission bits for  new  message  files.   See  <u><a href="../man1/chmod.1.html">chmod</a></u>(1)  for  an
            explanation  of the octal number.  Note that some filesystems, such as FAT32, do not support removal
            of read file permissions.  (profile, default: 0600)

       <b>Folder-Protect</b>: 700
            An octal number which defines the permission bits for new folder directories.  See <u><a href="../man1/chmod.1.html">chmod</a></u>(1)  for  an
            explanation of the octal number.  (profile, default: 700)

       <b>datalocking</b>: fcntl
            The locking algorithm used to lock changes to any <b>nmh</b> data files, such as sequences or context.  The
            locking algorithm is any one of the following entries:

                 fcntl dot flock lockf

            Available  locking  algorithms  can  vary  depending  on  the  operating  system.   Note: currently,
            transactional  locking  is  only  supported  on  public  sequences;  see  <u><a href="../man5/mh-sequence.5.html">mh-sequence</a></u>(5)  for   more
            information.  (profile, default: fcntl)

       <u>program</u>: <u>default</u> <u>switches</u>
            Sets default switches to be used whenever the mh program <u>program</u> is invoked.  For example, one could
            override the “Editor:” profile component when replying to messages by adding a component such as:

                 repl: -editor <a href="file:/bin/ed">/bin/ed</a>

            (profile, no defaults)

       <u>lasteditor</u><b>-next:</b> <u>nexteditor</u>
            Names  “nexteditor”  to  be  the  default editor after using “lasteditor”.  This takes effect at the
            “What now?” prompt in <b>comp</b>, <b>dist</b>, <b>forw</b>, and <b>repl</b>.  After editing the draft  with  “lasteditor”,  the
            default  editor  is set to be “nexteditor”.  If the user types “edit” without any arguments to “What
            now?”, then “nexteditor” is used.  (profile, no default)

       <b>Folder-Stack</b>: <u>folders</u>
            The contents of the folder-stack for the <b>folder</b> command.  (context, no default)

       <b>Local-Mailbox</b>: Your Username &lt;<a href="mailto:user@some.host">user@some.host</a>&gt;
            Tells the MH programs what your local mailbox is.  If set, it will be used by the default  component
            files  by  programs like <b>comp</b> and <b>repl</b> to construct your default “From:” header.  The text used here
            will be copied exactly to your “From:” header, so it should already be RFC 822 compliant.   If  this
            is  set,  the  <b>Signature</b>  profile  entry  is  <u>not</u>  used,  so  it should include a signature as well.
            (profile, default: <a href="mailto:userid@local.hostname">userid@local.hostname</a>)

       <b>Alternate-Mailboxes</b>: mh@uci-750a, bug-mh*
            Tells <b>repl</b> and <b>scan</b> which additional addresses are yours.  In this way, <b>repl</b> knows  which  addresses
            should be included in the reply, and <b>scan</b> knows if a message originated from you.  Addresses must be
            separated  by a comma, and the hostnames listed should be the “official” hostnames for the mailboxes
            you indicate, as local nicknames for hosts are not replaced with their  official  site  names.   For
            each  address,  if  a  host is not given, then that address on any host is considered to be you.  In
            addition, an asterisk (`*') may appear at either or both ends of the mailbox and  host  to  indicate
            wild-card matching.  (profile, default: your user-id)

       <b>Aliasfile</b>: aliases <u>other-aliases</u>
            Indicates  alias files for <b>ali</b>, <b>whom</b>, and <b>send</b>.  This may be used instead of the <b>-alias</b> <u>file</u> switch.
            (profile, no default)

       <b>Draft-Folder</b>: drafts
            Indicates a default draft folder for <b>comp</b>, <b>dist</b>, <b>forw</b>,  <b>refile</b>,  and  <b>repl</b>.   Read  <u><a href="../man5/mh-draft.5.html">mh-draft</a></u>(5)  for
            details.  (profile, no default)

       <b>digest-issue-</b><u>list</u><b>:</b> 1
            Tells <b>forw</b> the last issue of the last volume sent for the digest <u>list</u>.  (context, no default)

       <b>digest-volume-</b><u>list</u><b>:</b> 1
            Tells <b>forw</b> the last volume sent for the digest <u>list</u>.  (context, no default)

       <b>MailDrop</b>: .mail
            Tells  <b>inc</b>  your  mail  drop,  if different from the default.  This is superseded by the environment
            variable MAILDROP.  (profile, default: <a href="file:/var/mail/">/var/mail/</a>$USER)

       <b>Signature</b>: RAND MH System (agent: Marshall Rose)
            Tells front-end programs such as <b>comp</b>, <b>forw</b>, and <b>repl</b> your mail  signature.   (This  is  not  to  be
            confused  with  a .signature that might be appended to mails.) This is superseded by the environment
            variable SIGNATURE.  If SIGNATURE is not set and this profile entry is not present, the “gcos” field
            of the <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u> file will be used.  Your signature will be added to the address <b>send</b> puts in  the
            “From:”  header;  do  not  include  an  address  in the signature text.  The “Local-Mailbox” profile
            component supersedes all of this.  (profile, no default)

       <b>credentials</b>: legacy
            Indicates how the username and password  credentials  will  be  retrieved  for  access  to  external
            servers,  such  as those that provide SMTP or POP service.  The supported entry values are “legacy”,
            “file:<u>netrc</u>”, and “file-nopermcheck:<u>netrc</u>”.  With “legacy”, or if there is no credentials entry, the
            username is the first of:

                 1)   <b>-user</b> switch to <b>inc</b>, <b>msgchk</b>, <b>post</b>, <b>send</b>, or <b>whom</b> program
                 2)   the login name on the local machine

            The password for SMTP services is the first of:

                 1)   password value from matching entry in file named “.netrc” in the user's home directory
                 2)   password obtained by interactively prompting the user

            With a “file:<u>netrc</u>” <b>credentials</b> entry, the username is the first of:
                 1)   <b>-user</b> switch to program
                 2)   login name from matching entry in <u>netrc</u> file
                 3)   value provided by user in response to interactive query

            Similarly, the password is provided either in the <u>netrc</u> file or interactively.   <u>netrc</u>  can  be  any
            valid   filename,  either  absolute  or  relative  to  Path  or  $HOME.   The  <u>netrc</u>  file  contains
            authentication information, for each server, using a line of the following form.  (Replace <u>myserver</u>,
            <u>mylogin</u>, and <u>mypassword</u> with your own account information.)

                 <b>machine</b> <u>myserver</u> <b>login</b> <u>mylogin</u> <b>password</b> <u>mypassword</u>

            This <u>netrc</u> file must be owned and readable only by you.

            The “file-nopermcheck:<u>netrc</u>” <b>credentials</b> entry is identical in behavior to the  “file”  entry,  with
            the  exception  that  the  permission checks done by “file” are not performed.  This entry should be
            used with caution and only when absolutely necessary.  (profile, default: legacy)

       <b>Welcome</b>: disable
            If the Welcome component is not present, or its value is not “<u>disable</u>”, a welcome  message  will  be
            displayed the first time that an interactive <b>nmh</b> program is run after updating the <b>nmh</b> installation.
            The user must press the Enter key to continue.

            If  the  MHCONTEXT  environment  variable  is  set  and  non-empty (and the Welcome component is not
            “<u>disable</u>”), the welcome message is only displayed if the context file contains a version  reference,
            and that reference is older than the installed <b>nmh</b> version.  The version reference is of the form:

                 Version: nmh-1.8

   <b>Process</b> <b>Profile</b> <b>Entries</b>
       The following profile elements are used whenever an <b>nmh</b> program invokes some other program, such as <b>more</b>.
       The  <u>.mh-profile</u>  can  be  used  to select alternate programs if the user wishes.  The default values are
       given in the examples.

       If the profile element contains spaces, the element is split at spaces into  tokens  and  each  token  is
       given  as a separate argument to the <u><a href="../man2/execvp.2.html">execvp</a></u>(2) system call.  If the element contains shell metacharacters
       then the entire element is executed using <b><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></b>.

       <b>buildmimeproc</b>: /usr/bin/mh/mhbuild
            This is the program used by <b>whatnow</b> to process drafts which are MIME composition files.

       <b>fileproc</b>: /usr/bin/mh/refile
            This program is used to refile or link a message to another folder.  It is used by <b>post</b>  to  file  a
            copy of a message into a folder given by a “Fcc:” field.  It is used by the draft folder facility in
            <b>comp</b>,  <b>dist</b>,  <b>forw</b>,  and <b>repl</b> to refile a draft message into another folder.  It is used to refile a
            draft message in response to the <b>refile</b> directive at the “What now?” prompt.

       <b>formatproc</b>:
            Program called by <b>mhl</b> to filter a component when it is tagged with the “format” variable in the  mhl
            filter.  See <u><a href="../man5/mhl.5.html">mhl</a></u>(5) for more information.

       <b>incproc</b>: /usr/bin/mh/inc
            Program called by <b>mhmail</b> to incorporate new mail when it is invoked with no arguments.

       <b>lproc</b>: more
            This  program  is  used  to  list the contents of a message in response to the <b>list</b> directive at the
            “What now?” prompt.  It is also used by the draft folder facility in <b>comp</b>, <b>dist</b>, <b>forw</b>, and  <b>repl</b>  to
            display  the draft message.  (Note that the environment variable PAGER supersedes the default built-
            in pager command.)

       <b>mailproc</b>: /usr/bin/mh/mhmail
            This is the program used to automatically mail various messages and notifications.  It  is  used  by
            <b>send</b>  to  post  failure  notices.   It  is used to retrieve an external-body with access-type `mail-
            server' (such as when storing the body with <b>mhstore</b>).

       <b>mhlproc</b>: /usr/lib/mh/mhl
            This is the program used to filter messages in various ways.  It is used by  <b>mhshow</b>  to  filter  and
            display the message headers of MIME messages.  When the <b>-format</b> or <b>-filter</b> option is used by <b>forw</b> or
            <b>repl</b>,  the  <u>mhlproc</u>  is  used  to  filter  the  message that you are forwarding, or to which you are
            replying.  When the <b>-filter</b> option is given to <b>send</b>, the <u>mhlproc</u> is used to filter the copy  of  the
            message that is sent to “Bcc:” recipients.

       <b>moreproc</b>: more
            This is the program used by <b>mhl</b> to page the <b>mhl</b> formatted message when displaying to a terminal.  It
            is  also  the  default  program  used by <b>mhshow</b> to display message bodies (or message parts) of type
            text/plain.  (Note that the  environment  variable  PAGER  supersedes  the  default  built-in  pager
            command.)

       <b>packproc</b>: /usr/bin/mh/packf
            Currently not used.

       <b>postproc</b>: /usr/lib/mh/post
            This  is the program used by <b>send</b>, <b>mhmail</b>, <b>rcvdist</b>, and <b>viamail</b> (used by the <b>sendfiles</b> shell script)
            to post a message to the mail transport system.  It is also called by <b>whom</b> (called with the switches
            <b>-whom</b> and <b>-library</b>) to do address verification.

            If the profile contains a <b>post</b> component and a <b>postproc</b> component is not present, a warning  message
            that  the  <b>post</b>  component  will  be  ignored  will be displayed by every <b>nmh</b> program that reads the
            profile and has its stderr associated with a terminal.

       <b>rmmproc</b>: none
            This is the program used by <b>rmm</b>, <b>refile</b>, and <b>mhfixmsg</b> to delete a message from a folder.

       <b>sendproc</b>: /usr/bin/mh/send
            This is the program used by <b>whatnow</b> to actually send the message

       <b>showmimeproc</b>: /usr/bin/mh/mhshow
            This is the program used by <b>show</b> to process and display non-text (MIME) messages.

       <b>showproc</b>: /usr/lib/mh/mhl
            This is the program used by <b>show</b> to filter and display text (non-MIME) messages.

       <b>whatnowproc</b>: /usr/bin/mh/whatnow
            This is the program invoked by <b>comp</b>, <b>dist</b>, <b>forw</b>, and <b>repl</b>  to  query  about  the  disposition  of  a
            composed draft message.

       <b>whomproc</b>: /usr/bin/mh/whom
            This is the program used by <b>whatnow</b> to determine to whom a message would be sent.

   <b>Profile</b> <b>Lookup</b>
       After  consulting  .mh_profile,  some  programs  read an optional profile specified by a program-specific
       environment variable, and  then  the  system-wide  profile  /etc/nmh/mhn.defaults.   These  programs  are
       <b>mhbuild</b>, <b>mhshow</b>, <b>mhstore</b>, and <b>mhn</b>.  <b>mhfixmsg</b> is similar, but has no optional profile.

       The  first  occurrence  of a component is used, e.g. .mh_profile's trumps $MHSHOW's.  A component with no
       value still stops further occurrences being used, but is considered absent.

       The <u>.mh-profile</u> contains only static information, which <b>nmh</b> programs will <u>not</u> update.  Changes in context
       are made to the <u>context</u> file kept in the users <b>nmh</b> directory.  This includes, but is not limited to:  the
       “Current-Folder” entry and all private sequence information.  Public sequence information is kept in each
       folder in the file determined by the “mh-sequences” profile entry (default is <u>.mh-sequences</u>).

       The  <u>.mh-profile</u> may override the path of the <u>context</u> file, by specifying a “context” entry (this must be
       in lower-case).  If the entry is not absolute (does not  start  with  a  “/”),  then  it  is  interpreted
       relative  to  the  user's <b>nmh</b> directory.  As a result, you can actually have more than one set of private
       sequences by using different context files.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The operation of <b>nmh</b> and its  commands  it  also  controlled  by  the  presence  of  certain  environment
       variables.

       Many  of  these environment variables are used internally by the “What now?” interface.  It's amazing all
       the information that has to get passed via environment variables to make the “What now?”  interface  look
       squeaky  clean  to  the  <b>nmh</b> user, isn't it?  The reason for all this is that the <b>nmh</b> user can select any
       program as the <u>whatnowproc</u>, including one of the standard shells.  As a result, it's not possible to pass
       information via an argument list.  The convention is that  environment  variables  whose  names  are  all
       upper-case are user-settable; those whose names are lower-case only are used internally by nmh and should
       not generally be set by the user.

       HOME   If  set  and  non-null,  it  is  used  as  the  user's  home  directory.  If not set or null, then
              <a href="../man3/getpwuid.3.html">getpwuid</a>(3)'s pw_dir is used.

       LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, and LANG
              These variables are used to set the locale, see <a href="../man1/locale.1.html">locale</a>(1).  The “locale” profile entry  supersedes
              these.

       MAILDROP
              This variable tells <b>inc</b> the default mail drop.  This supersedes the “MailDrop” profile entry.

       MAILHOST
              This  variable  tells  <b>inc</b>  the  POP  host  to query for mail to incorporate.  See <u><a href="../man1/inc.1.html">inc</a></u>(1) for more
              information.

       MH     With this environment variable, you can specify a profile other than <u>.mh-profile</u> to be read by the
              <b>nmh</b> programs that you invoke.  If the value of MH is not absolute, (i.e., does not  begin  with  a
              “/”),  it  will  be presumed to start from the current working directory.  This is one of the very
              few exceptions in <b>nmh</b> where non-absolute pathnames are not considered relative to the  user's  <b>nmh</b>
              directory.

       MHBUILD
              With  this  environment  variable, you can specify an additional user profile (file) to be read by
              <b>mhbuild</b>, in addition to the mhn.defaults profile.

       MHCONTEXT
              With this environment variable, you can specify a context other than the normal context  file  (as
              specified  in  the  <b>nmh</b> profile).  As usual, unless the value of MHCONTEXT is absolute, it will be
              presumed to start from your <b>nmh</b> directory.

       MHLDEBUG
              If this variable is set to a non-null value, <b>mhl</b> will emit debugging information.

       MHMTSCONF
              If this variable is set to a  non-null  value,  it  specifies  the  name  of  the  mail  transport
              configuration  file  to use by <b>inc</b>, <b>post</b>, and other programs that interact with the mail transport
              system, instead of the default.  See <u><a href="../man5/mh-tailor.5.html">mh-tailor</a></u>(5).

       MHMTSUSERCONF
              If this variable is set  to  a  non-null  value,  it  specifies  the  name  of  a  mail  transport
              configuration file to be read in addition to the default.  See <u><a href="../man5/mh-tailor.5.html">mh-tailor</a></u>(5).

       MHN    With  this  environment  variable, you can specify an additional user profile (file) to be read by
              <b>mhn</b>, in addition to the mhn.defaults profile.  <b>mhn</b> is deprecated, so  support  for  this  variable
              will be removed from a future nmh release.

       MHSHOW With  this  environment  variable, you can specify an additional user profile (file) to be read by
              <b>mhshow</b>, in addition to the mhn.defaults profile.

       MHSTORE
              With this environment variable, you can specify an additional user profile (file) to  be  read  by
              <b>mhstore</b>, in addition to the mhn.defaults profile.

       MHTMPDIR, TMPDIR
              These variables are searched, in order, for the directory in which to create some temporary files.
              MHTMPDIR is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of nmh.

       MHWDEBUG
              If this variable is set to a non-null value, <b>nmh</b> commands that use the <b>Alternate-Mailboxes</b> profile
              entry will display debugging information about the values in that entry.

       PAGER  If set to a non-null value, this supersedes the value of the default built-in pager command.

       SIGNATURE
              This  variable  tells  <b>send</b> and <b>post</b> your mail signature.  This supersedes the “Signature” profile
              entry, and is not used when the “Local-Mailbox” profile component is set.

       USER   This variable tells <b>repl</b> your user name and <b>inc</b>  your  default  mail  drop:   see  the  “MailDrop”
              profile entry.

       USERNAME_EXTENSION
              This variable is for use with username_extension masquerading.  See <u><a href="../man5/mh-tailor.5.html">mh-tailor</a></u>(5).

       editalt
              This  is  the  alternate  message.   This  is set by <b>dist</b> and <b>repl</b> during edit sessions so you can
              peruse the message being distributed or replied to.  The  message  is  also  available,  when  the
              <b>-atfile</b> switch is used, through a link called “@” in the current directory if your current working
              directory and the folder the message lives in are on the same Unix filesystem, and if your current
              working directory is writable.

       mhaltmsg
              <b>dist</b>  and <b>repl</b> set mhaltmsg to tell the <u>whatnowproc</u> about an alternate message associated with the
              draft (the message being distributed or replied to).

       mhannotate
              This is set by <b>dist</b>, <b>forw</b>, and <b>repl</b> if annotations are to occur.

       mhdist <b>dist</b> sets mhdist to tell the <u>whatnowproc</u> that message re-distribution is occurring.

       mhdraft
              This is the path to the working draft.  It is set by <b>comp</b>,  <b>dist</b>,  <b>forw</b>,  and  <b>repl</b>  to  tell  the
              <u>whatnowproc</u> which file to ask “What now?” questions about.

       mheditor
              This  is  set  by  <b>comp</b>,  <b>repl</b>, <b>forw</b>, and <b>dist</b> to tell the <u>whatnowproc</u> the user's choice of editor
              (unless overridden by <b>-noedit</b>).

       mhfolder
              This is the folder containing the alternate message.  It is set  by  <b>dist</b>  and  <b>repl</b>  during  edit
              sessions  so you can peruse other messages in the current folder besides the one being distributed
              or replied to.  The environment variable mhfolder is also set by <b>next</b>, <b>prev</b>, and <b>show</b> for  use  by
              <b>mhl</b>.

       mhinplace
              This is set by <b>dist</b>, <b>forw</b>, and <b>repl</b> if annotations are to occur.

       mhmessages
              This is set by <b>dist</b>, <b>forw</b>, and <b>repl</b> if annotations are to occur.

       mhuse  This may be set by <b>comp</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There is some question as to what kind of arguments should be placed in the profile as options.  In order
       to  provide  a  clear answer, recall the command line semantics of all <b>nmh</b> programs: conflicting switches
       (e.g.  <b>-header</b> and <b>-noheader</b>) may occur more than one time on the command  line,  with  the  last  switch
       taking  effect.  Other arguments, such as message sequences, filenames and folders, are always remembered
       on the invocation line and are not superseded by following arguments of the same type.  Hence, it is safe
       to place only switches (and their arguments) in the profile.

       If one finds that an <b>nmh</b> program is being invoked again and again with  the  same  arguments,  and  those
       arguments  aren't  switches,  then  there  are a few possible solutions to this problem.  The first is to
       create a (soft) link in your <u>$HOME/bin</u> directory to the <b>nmh</b> program of your choice.  By giving this  link
       a different name, you can create a new entry in your profile and use an alternate set of defaults for the
       <b>nmh</b>  command.   Similarly,  you  could  create  a small shell script which called the <b>nmh</b> program of your
       choice with an alternate set of invocation line switches (using links and an alternate profile  entry  is
       preferable to this solution).

       Finally, the <b>csh</b> user could create an alias for the command of the form:

            alias cmd 'cmd arg1 arg2 ...'

       In  this  way,  the  user  can  avoid  lengthy  type-in to the shell, and still give <b>nmh</b> commands safely.
       (Recall that some <b>nmh</b> commands invoke others, and that in all cases, the profile is  read,  meaning  that
       aliases are disregarded beyond an initial command invocation)
