</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       NetworkManager.conf - NetworkManager configuration file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf, <a href="file:/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/">/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/</a><u>name</u>.conf,
       /run/NetworkManager/conf.d/<u>name</u>.conf, /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/<u>name</u>.conf,
       /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager-intern.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       NetworkManager.conf is the configuration file for NetworkManager. It is used to set up various aspects of
       NetworkManager's behavior. The location of the main file and configuration directories may be changed
       through use of the <b>--config</b>, <b>--config-dir</b>, <b>--system-config-dir</b>, and <b>--intern-config</b> argument for
       NetworkManager, respectively.

       If a default NetworkManager.conf is provided by your distribution's packages, you should not modify it,
       since your changes may get overwritten by package updates. Instead, you can add additional .conf files to
       the <a href="file:/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d">/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d</a> directory. These will be read in order, with later files overriding
       earlier ones. Packages might install further configuration snippets to /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d.
       This directory is parsed first, even before NetworkManager.conf. Scripts can also put per-boot
       configuration into /run/NetworkManager/conf.d. This directory is parsed second, also before
       NetworkManager.conf. The loading of a file /run/NetworkManager/conf.d/<u>name</u>.conf can be prevented by
       adding a file <a href="file:/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/">/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/</a><u>name</u>.conf. Likewise, a file
       /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/<u>name</u>.conf can be shadowed by putting a file of the same name to either
       <a href="file:/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d">/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d</a> or /run/NetworkManager/conf.d.

       NetworkManager can overwrite certain user configuration options via D-Bus or other internal operations.
       In this case it writes those changes to /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager-intern.conf. This file is
       not intended to be modified by the user, but it is read last and can shadow user configuration from
       NetworkManager.conf.

       Certain settings from the configuration can be reloaded at runtime either by sending SIGHUP signal or via
       D-Bus' Reload call.

       NetworkManager does not require any configuration in NetworkManager.conf. Depending on your use case, you
       may remove all files to restore the default configuration (factory reset). But note that your
       distribution or other packages may drop configuration snippets for NetworkManager, such that they are
       part of the factory default.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file format is so-called key file (sort of ini-style format). It consists of sections
       (groups) of key-value pairs. Lines beginning with a '#' and blank lines are considered comments. Sections
       are started by a header line containing the section enclosed in '[' and ']', and ended implicitly by the
       start of the next section or the end of the file. Each key-value pair must be contained in a section.

       For keys that take a list of devices as their value, you can specify devices by their MAC addresses or
       interface names, or "*" to specify all devices. See the section called “Device List Format” below.

       A simple configuration file looks like this:

           [main]
           plugins=keyfile

       As an extension to the normal keyfile format, you can also append a value to a previously-set list-valued
       key by doing:

           plugins+=another-plugin
           plugins-=remove-me

</pre><h4><b>MAIN</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>plugins</u>
           Lists system settings plugin names separated by ','. These plugins are used to read and write
           system-wide connection profiles. When multiple plugins are specified, the connections are read from
           all listed plugins. When writing connections, the plugins will be asked to save the connection in the
           order listed here; if the first plugin cannot write out that connection type (or can't write out any
           connections) the next plugin is tried, etc. If none of the plugins can save the connection, an error
           is returned to the user.

           The default value and the number of available plugins is distro-specific. See the section called
           “PLUGINS” below for the available plugins. Note that NetworkManager's native keyfile plugin is always
           appended to the end of this list (if it doesn't already appear earlier in the list).

       <u>monitor-connection-files</u>
           This setting is deprecated and has no effect. Profiles from disk are never automatically reloaded.
           Use for example nmcli connection (re)load for that.

       <u>auth-polkit</u>
           Whether the system uses PolicyKit for authorization. If true, non-root requests are authorized using
           PolicyKit. Requests from root (user ID zero) are always granted without asking PolicyKit. If false,
           all requests will be allowed and PolicyKit is not used. If set to root-only PolicyKit is not used and
           all requests except root are denied. The default value is true.

       <u>dhcp</u>
           This key sets up what DHCP client NetworkManager will use. Allowed values depend on build
           configuration; this version of NetworkManager was built with support for the following clients:
           internal, dhcpcd.

           The internal client is built-in, while other options may require an external DHCP client to be
           installed.

           If this key is missing, internal is used with a fallback to other supported clients.

       <u>no-auto-default</u>
           Specify devices for which NetworkManager shouldn't create default wired connection (Auto eth0). By
           default, NetworkManager creates a temporary wired connection for any Ethernet device that is managed
           and doesn't have a connection configured. List a device in this option to inhibit creating the
           default connection for the device. May have the special value * to apply to all devices.

           When the default wired connection is deleted or saved to a new persistent connection by a plugin, the
           device is added to a list in the file /var/lib/NetworkManager/no-auto-default.state to prevent
           creating the default connection for that device again.

           See the section called “Device List Format” for the syntax how to specify a device.

           Example:

               no-auto-default=00:22:68:5c:5d:c4,00:1e:65:ff:aa:ee
               no-auto-default=eth0,eth1
               no-auto-default=*

       <u>ignore-carrier</u>
           This setting is deprecated for the per-device setting ignore-carrier which overwrites this setting if
           specified (See <u>ignore-carrier</u>). Otherwise, it is a list of matches to specify for which device
           carrier should be ignored. See the section called “Device List Format” for the syntax how to specify
           a device. Note that controller types like bond, bridge, and team ignore carrier by default. You can
           however revert that default using the "except:" specifier (or better, use the per-device setting
           instead of the deprecated setting).

       <u>assume-ipv6ll-only</u>
           Specify devices for which NetworkManager will try to generate a connection based on initial
           configuration when the device only has an IPv6 link-local address.

           See the section called “Device List Format” for the syntax how to specify a device.

       <u>configure-and-quit</u>
           This option is no longer useful to configure in NetworkManager.conf file. It can however also be
           configured on the command line with the same values, where it has some use.

           When set to 'initrd', NetworkManager does not connect to D-Bus and quits after configuring the
           network. This is an implementation detail how the NetworkManager module of dracut can run
           NetworkManager. An alternative to this is having NetworkManager as a systemd service with D-Bus in
           initrd.

           The value 'true' is unsupported since version 1.36. Previously this was a mode where NetworkManager
           would quit after configuring the network and run helper processes for DHCP and SLAAC.

           Otherwise, NetworkManager runs a system service with D-Bus and does not quit during normal operation.

       <u>hostname-mode</u>
           Set the management mode of the hostname. This parameter will affect only the transient hostname. If a
           valid static hostname is set, NetworkManager will skip the update of the hostname despite the value
           of this option. An hostname empty or equal to 'localhost', 'localhost6', 'localhost.localdomain' or
           'localhost6.localdomain' is considered invalid.

           default: NetworkManager will update the hostname with the one provided via DHCP or reverse DNS lookup
           of the IP address on the connection with the default route or on any connection with the property
           hostname.only-from-default set to 'false'. Connections are considered in order of increasing value of
           the hostname.priority property. In case multiple connections have the same priority, connections
           activated earlier are considered first. If no hostname can be determined in such way, the hostname
           will be updated to the last one set outside NetworkManager or to 'localhost.localdomain'.

           dhcp: this is similar to 'default', with the difference that after trying to get the DHCP hostname,
           reverse DNS lookup is not done. Note that selecting this option is equivalent to setting the property
           'hostname.from-dns-lookup' to 'false' globally for all connections in NetworkManager.conf.

           none: NetworkManager will not manage the transient hostname and will never set it.

       <u>dns</u>
           Set the DNS processing mode.

           If the key is unspecified, default is used, unless <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> is a symlink to
           <a href="file:/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf">/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf</a>, <a href="file:/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf">/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf</a>, <a href="file:/lib/systemd/resolv.conf">/lib/systemd/resolv.conf</a> or
           /usr/lib/systemd/resolv.conf. In that case, systemd-resolved is chosen automatically.

           default: NetworkManager will update <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> to reflect the nameservers provided by currently
           active connections. The rc-manager setting (below) controls how this is done.

           dnsmasq: NetworkManager will run dnsmasq as a local caching nameserver, using "Conditional
           Forwarding" if you are connected to a VPN, and then update resolv.conf to point to the local
           nameserver. It is possible to pass custom options to the dnsmasq instance by adding them to files in
           the "/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/" directory. Note that when multiple upstream servers are
           available, dnsmasq will initially contact them in parallel and then use the fastest to respond,
           probing again other servers after some time. This behavior can be modified passing the 'all-servers'
           or 'strict-order' options to dnsmasq (see the manual page for more details).

           systemd-resolved: NetworkManager will push the DNS configuration to systemd-resolved

           dnsconfd: NetworkManager will push the DNS configuration to dnsconfd

            and by default set ipvX.routed-dns to
                   yes, so servers are contacted through right interfaces.

                   none: NetworkManager will not modify resolv.conf. This implies rc-manager unmanaged

           Note that the plugins dnsmasq,systemd-resolved and dnsconfd are caching local nameservers. Hence,
           when NetworkManager writes /run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf and <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> (according to
           rc-manager setting below), the name server there will be localhost only. NetworkManager also writes a
           file /run/NetworkManager/no-stub-resolv.conf that contains the original name servers pushed to the
           DNS plugin.

           When using dnsmasq,systemd-resolved and dnsconfd per-connection added dns servers will always be
           queried using the device the connection has been activated on.

       <u>rc-manager</u>
           Set the resolv.conf management mode. This option is about how NetworkManager writes to
           <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a>, if at all. The default value depends on NetworkManager build options, and this
           version of NetworkManager was built with a default of "auto". Regardless of this setting,
           NetworkManager will always write its version of resolv.conf to its runtime state directory as
           /run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf.

           If you configure dns=none or make <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> immutable with chattr +i, NetworkManager will
           ignore this setting and always choose unmanaged (below).

           auto: if systemd-resolved plugin is configured via the dns setting or if it gets detected as main DNS
           plugin, NetworkManager will update systemd-resolved without touching /etc/resolv.conf. Alternatively,
           if resolvconf or netconfig are enabled at compile time and the respective binary is found,
           NetworkManager will automatically use it. Note that if you install or uninstall these binaries, you
           need to reload the rc-manager setting with SIGHUP or systemctl reload NetworkManager. As last
           fallback it uses the symlink option (see next).

           symlink: If <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> is a regular file or does not exist, NetworkManager will write the file
           directly. If <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> is instead a symlink, NetworkManager will leave it alone. Unless the
           symlink points to the internal file /run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf, in which case the symlink will
           be updated to emit an inotify notification. This allows the user to conveniently instruct
           NetworkManager not to manage <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> by replacing it with a symlink.

           file: NetworkManager will write <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> as regular file. If it finds a symlink to an
           existing target, it will follow the symlink and update the target instead. In no case will an
           existing symlink be replaced by a file. Note that older versions of NetworkManager behaved
           differently and would replace dangling symlinks with a plain file.

           resolvconf: NetworkManager will run resolvconf to update the DNS configuration.

           netconfig: NetworkManager will run netconfig to update the DNS configuration.

           unmanaged: don't touch /etc/resolv.conf.

           none: deprecated alias for symlink.

       <u>systemd-resolved</u>
           Additionally, send the connection DNS configuration to systemd-resolved. Defaults to "true".

           Note that this setting has no effect if the main <u>dns</u> plugin is already systemd-resolved. It is
           complementary to the <u>dns</u> setting to configure systemd-resolved alongside the main plugin.

           If systemd-resolved is enabled, either via this setting or the main DNS plugin, the connectivity
           check resolves the hostname per-device.

       <u>debug</u>
           Comma separated list of options to aid debugging. This value will be combined with the environment
           variable NM_DEBUG. Currently, the following values are supported:

           RLIMIT_CORE: set ulimit -c unlimited to write out core dumps. Beware, that a core dump can contain
           sensitive information such as passwords or configuration settings.

           fatal-warnings: set g_log_set_always_fatal() to core dump on warning messages from glib. This is
           equivalent to the --g-fatal-warnings command line option.

       <u>autoconnect-retries-default</u>
           The number of times a connection activation should be automatically tried before switching to another
           one. This value applies only to connections that can auto-connect and have a
           connection.autoconnect-retries property set to -1. If not specified, connections will be tried 4
           times. Setting this value to 1 means to try activation once, without retry.

       <u>firewall-backend</u>
           The firewall backend for configuring masquerading with shared mode. Set to either iptables, nftables
           or none.  iptables and nftables require iptables and nft application, respectively.  none means to
           skip firewall configuration if the users wish to manage firewall themselves. If unspecified, it will
           be auto detected.

       <u>iwd-config-path</u>
           If the value is "auto" (the default), IWD is queried for its current state directory when it appears
           on D-Bus -- the directory where IWD keeps its network configuration files -- usually /var/lib/iwd.
           NetworkManager will then attempt to write copies of new or modified Wi-Fi connection profiles,
           converted into the IWD format, into this directory thus making IWD connection properties editable. NM
           will overwrite existing files without preserving their contents.

           The path can also be overridden by pointing to a specific existing and writable directory. On the
           other hand setting this to an empty string or any other value disables the profile conversion
           mechanism.

           This mechanism allows editing connection profile settings such as the 802.1x configuration using
           NetworkManager clients. Without it such changes have no effect in IWD.

       <u>migrate-ifcfg-rh</u>
           Whether NetworkManager tries to automatically convert any connection profile stored in ifcfg-rh
           format to the keyfile format. Support for ifcfg-rh is deprecated and will be eventually removed. If
           enabled, the migration is performed at every startup of the daemon. The default value is false.

</pre><h4><b>KEYFILE</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       This section contains keyfile-plugin-specific options, and is normally only used when you are not using
       any other distro-specific plugin.

       <u>hostname</u>
           This key is deprecated and has no effect since the hostname is now stored in <a href="file:/etc/hostname">/etc/hostname</a> or other
           system configuration files according to build options.

       <u>path</u>
           The location where keyfiles are read and stored. This defaults to
           "/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections".

       <u>rename</u>
           NetworkManager automatically chooses a filename when storing a new profile to disk. That name depends
           on the profile's name (connection.id). When updating a profile's name, the file is not renamed to not
           break scripts that rely on the filename for the profile. By setting this option to "true",
           NetworkManager renames the keyfile on update of the profile, to follow the profile's name. This
           defaults to "false".

       <u>unmanaged-devices</u>
           Set devices that should be ignored by NetworkManager.

           A device unmanaged due to this option is strictly unmanaged and cannot be overruled by using the API
           like <b>nmcli</b> <b>device</b> <b>set</b> <b>$IFNAME</b> <b>managed</b> <b>yes</b>. Also, a device that is unmanaged for other reasons, like
           an udev rule, cannot be made managed with this option (e.g. by using an except: specifier). These two
           points make it different from the device*.managed option which for that reason may be a better
           choice.

           See the section called “Device List Format” for the syntax on how to specify a device.

           Example:

               unmanaged-devices=interface-name:em4
               unmanaged-devices=mac:00:22:68:1c:59:b1;mac:00:1E:65:30:D1:C4;interface-name:eth2

</pre><h4><b>IFUPDOWN</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       This section contains ifupdown-specific options and thus only has effect when using the ifupdown plugin.

       <u>managed</u>
           If set to true, then interfaces listed in /etc/network/interfaces are managed by NetworkManager. If
           set to false, then any interface listed in /etc/network/interfaces will be ignored by NetworkManager.
           Remember that NetworkManager controls the default route, so because the interface is ignored,
           NetworkManager may assign the default route to some other interface.

           The default value is false.

</pre><h4><b>LOGGING</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       This section controls NetworkManager's logging. Logging is very important to understand what
       NetworkManager is doing. When you report a bug, do not unnecessarily filter or limit the log file. Just
       enable level=TRACE and domains=ALL to collect everything.

       The recommended way for enabling logging is with a file /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/95-logging.conf that
       contains

           [logging]
           level=TRACE
           domains=ALL

       and restart the daemon with <b>systemctl</b> <b>restart</b> <b>NetworkManager</b>. Then reproduce the problem. You can find
       the logs in syslog (for example <b>journalctl</b>, or <b>journalctl</b> <b>-u</b> <b>NetworkManager</b> to show only logs from
       NetworkManager).

       Any settings here are overridden by the <b>--log-level</b> and <b>--log-domains</b> command-line options. Logging can
       also be reconfigured at runtime with <b>nmcli</b> <b>general</b> <b>logging</b> <b>level</b> <b>"$LEVEL"</b> <b>domains</b> <b>"$DOMAINS"</b>. However,
       often it is interesting to get a complete log from the start. Especially, when debugging an issue, enable
       debug logging in NetworkManager.conf and restart the service to enable verbose logging early on.

       By setting <b>nm.debug</b> on the kernel command line (either from /run/NetworkManager/proc-cmdline or
       <a href="file:/proc/cmdline">/proc/cmdline</a>), debug logging is enabled. This overrides both the command-line options and the settings
       from NetworkManager.conf.

       NetworkManager's logging aims not to contain private sensitive data and you should be fine sharing the
       debug logs. Still, there will be IP addresses and your network setup, if you consider that private then
       review the log before sharing. However, try not to mangle the logfile in a way that distorts the meaning
       too much.

       NetworkManager uses syslog or systemd-journald, depending on configuration. In any case, debug logs are
       verbose and might be rate limited or filtered by the logging daemon. For systemd-journald, see
       RateLimitIntervalSec and RateLimitBurst in journald.conf manual for how to disable that.

       <u>level</u>
           The default logging verbosity level. One of OFF, ERR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE, in order of
           verbosity.

           OFF disables all logging.  INFO is the default verbosity for regular operation.  TRACE is for
           debugging.

           The other levels are in most cases not useful. For example, DEBUG is between TRACE and INFO, but it's
           too verbose for regular operation and lacks possibly interesting messages for debugging. Almost
           always, when debugging an issue or reporting a bug, collect full level TRACE logs to get the full
           picture.

       <u>domains</u>
           Filter the messages by their topic. When debugging an issue, it's better to collect all logs (ALL
           domain) upfront. The unnecessary parts can always be ignored later.

           In the uncommon case to tune out certain topics, the following log domains are available: PLATFORM,
           RFKILL, ETHER, WIFI, BT, MB, DHCP4, DHCP6, PPP, WIFI_SCAN, IP4, IP6, AUTOIP4, DNS, VPN, SHARING,
           SUPPLICANT, AGENTS, SETTINGS, SUSPEND, CORE, DEVICE, OLPC, WIMAX, INFINIBAND, FIREWALL, ADSL, BOND,
           VLAN, BRIDGE, DBUS_PROPS, TEAM, CONCHECK, DCB, DISPATCH, AUDIT, SYSTEMD, VPN_PLUGIN, PROXY.

           In addition, these special domains can be used: NONE, ALL, DEFAULT, DHCP, IP.

           You can specify per-domain log level overrides by adding a colon and a log level to any domain. E.g.,
           "WIFI:DEBUG,WIFI_SCAN:OFF". Another example is ALL,VPN_PLUGIN:TRACE to enable all the logging there
           is (see about VPN_PLUGIN below).

               HW          : deprecated alias for "PLATFORM"

           In general, the logfile should not contain passwords or private data. However, you are always advised
           to check the file before posting it online or attaching to a bug report.  VPN_PLUGIN is special as it
           might reveal private information of the VPN plugins with verbose levels. Therefore this domain will
           be excluded when setting ALL or DEFAULT to more verbose levels then INFO.

       <u>backend</u>
           The logging backend. Supported values are "syslog" and "journal". When NetworkManager is started with
           "--debug" in addition all messages will be printed to stderr. If unspecified, the default is
           "journal".

       <u>audit</u>
           Whether the audit records are delivered to auditd, the audit daemon. If false, audit records will be
           sent only to the NetworkManager logging system. If set to true, they will be also sent to auditd. The
           default value is true.

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTION</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       Specify default values for connections.

       Such default values are only consulted if the corresponding per-connection property explicitly allows for
       that. That means, all these properties correspond to a property of the connection profile (for example
       connection.mud-url). Only if the per-profile property is set to a special value that indicates to use the
       default, the default value from NetworkManager.conf is consulted. It depends on the property, which is
       the special value that indicates fallback to the default, but it usually is something like empty, unset
       values or special numeric values like 0 or -1. That means the effectively used value can first always be
       configured for each profile, and these default values only matter if the per-profile values explicitly
       indicates to use the default from NetworkManager.conf.

       Note that while nmcli supports various aliases and convenience features for configuring properties, the
       settings in this section do not. For example, enum values usually only can be configured via their
       numeric magic number.

       Example:

           [connection]
           ipv6.ip6-privacy=0

   <b>Supported</b> <b>Properties</b>
       Not all properties can be overwritten, only the following properties are supported to have their default
       values configured (see <b><a href="../man5/nm-settings-nmcli.5.html">nm-settings-nmcli</a></b>(5) for details).

       <u>802-1x.auth-timeout</u>

       <u>cdma.mtu</u>

       <u>connection.auth-retries</u>
           If left unspecified, the default value is 3 tries before failing the connection.

       <u>connection.autoconnect-ports</u>

       <u>connection.autoconnect-slaves</u>
           This is deprecated, please use "connection.autoconnect-ports" instead.

       <u>connection.down-on-poweroff</u>
           Whether the connection will be brought down before the system is powered off.

       <u>connection.ip-ping-addresses-require-all</u>
           Whether it is sufficient for any ping check to succeed among the list of target addresses, or if all
           ping checks must succeed for the entire list of target addresses.

       <u>connection.mud-url</u>
           If unspecified, MUD URL defaults to "none".

       <u>connection.lldp</u>

       <u>connection.llmnr</u>
           If unspecified, the ultimate default values depends on the DNS plugin. With systemd-resolved the
           default currently is "yes" (2) and for all other plugins "no" (0).

       <u>connection.mdns</u>
           Currently only the systemd-resolve DNS plugin supports this setting. If the setting is unspecified
           both in the profile and in the global default here, then the default is determined by
           systemd-resolved. See MulticastDNS= in <b><a href="../man5/resolved.conf.5.html">resolved.conf</a></b>(5).

       <u>connection.mptcp-flags</u>
           If unspecified, the fallback is 0x22 ("enabled,subflow"). Note that if sysctl
           <a href="file:/proc/sys/net/mptcp/enabled">/proc/sys/net/mptcp/enabled</a> is disabled, NetworkManager will still not configure endpoints.

       <u>connection.dns-over-tls</u>
           If unspecified, the ultimate default values depends on the DNS plugin. With systemd-resolved the
           default currently is global setting and for all other plugins "no" (0).

       <u>connection.stable-id</u>

       <u>ethernet.cloned-mac-address</u>
           If left unspecified, it defaults to "preserve".

       <u>ethernet.generate-mac-address-mask</u>

       <u>ethernet.mtu</u>
           If configured explicitly to 0, the MTU is not reconfigured during device activation unless it is
           required due to IPv6 constraints. If left unspecified, a DHCP/IPv6 SLAAC provided value is used or
           the MTU is not reconfigured during activation.

       <u>ethernet.wake-on-lan</u>

       <u>gsm.mtu</u>

       <u>hostname.from-dhcp</u>

       <u>hostname.from-dns-lookup</u>

       <u>hostname.only-from-default</u>

       <u>hostname.priority</u>

       <u>infiniband.mtu</u>
           If configured explicitly to 0, the MTU is not reconfigured during device activation unless it is
           required due to IPv6 constraints. If left unspecified, a DHCP/IPv6 SLAAC provided value is used or
           the MTU is left unspecified on activation.

       <u>ip-tunnel.mtu</u>
           If configured explicitly to 0, the MTU is not reconfigured during device activation unless it is
           required due to IPv6 constraints. If left unspecified, a DHCP/IPv6 SLAAC provided value is used or a
           default of 1500.

       <u>ipv4.routed-dns</u>

       <u>ipv4.dad-timeout</u>

       <u>ipv4.dhcp-client-id</u>

       <u>ipv4.dhcp-dscp</u>

       <u>ipv4.dhcp-iaid</u>
           If left unspecified, it defaults to "ifname".

       <u>ipv4.dhcp-ipv6-only-preferred</u>
           If left unspecified, the "IPv6-only preferred" DHCPv4 option is disabled.

       <u>ipv4.dhcp-hostname-flags</u>
           If left unspecified, the value 3 (fqdn-encoded,fqdn-serv-update) is used.

       <u>ipv4.dhcp-send-hostname</u>
           Whether a hostname is sent to the DHCP server when acquiring a lease. When the property is not
           specified in the connection, the global value from NetworkManager configuration is looked up. If the
           global value is not set, the value from ipv4.dhcp-send-hostname-deprecated, which defaults to true,
           is used for backwards compatibility. In the future this will change and, in absence of a global
           default, it will always fallback to true.

       <u>ipv4.dhcp-send-release</u>
           Whether the DHCP client will send RELEASE message when bringing the connection down.

       <u>ipv4.dhcp-timeout</u>
           If left unspecified, the default value for the interface type is used.

       <u>ipv4.dhcp-vendor-class-identifier</u>
           If left unspecified, the default is to not send the DHCP option to the server.

       <u>ipv4.dns-priority</u>
           If unspecified or zero, use 50 for VPN profiles and 100 for other profiles.

       <u>ipv4.required-timeout</u>

       <u>ipv4.link-local</u>
           If left unspecified, fallback to "auto" which makes it dependent on "ipv4.method" setting.

       <u>ipv4.route-metric</u>

       <u>ipv4.route-table</u>
           If left unspecified, routes are only added to the main table. Note that this is different from
           explicitly selecting the main table 254, because of how NetworkManager removes extraneous routes from
           the tables.

       <u>ipv6.routed-dns</u>

       <u>ipv6.addr-gen-mode</u>
           If the per-profile setting is either "default" or "default-or-eui64", the global default is used. If
           the default is unspecified, the fallback value is either "stable-privacy" or "eui64", depending on
           whether the per-profile setting is "default" or "default-or-eui64, respectively.

       <u>ipv6.ra-timeout</u>
           If left unspecified, the default value depends on the sysctl solicitation settings.

       <u>ipv6.dhcp-send-hostname</u>
           Whether a hostname is sent to the DHCP server when acquiring a lease. When the property is not
           specified in the connection, the global value from NetworkManager configuration is looked up. If the
           global value is not set, the value from ipv6.dhcp-send-hostname-deprecated, which defaults to true,
           is used for backwards compatibility. In the future this will change and, in absence of a global
           default, it will always fallback to true.

       <u>ipv6.dhcp-send-release</u>
           Whether the DHCP client will send RELEASE message when bringing the connection down.

           If left unspecified, the default value for the interface type is used.

       <u>ipv6.dns-priority</u>
           If unspecified or zero, use 50 for VPN profiles and 100 for other profiles.

       <u>ipv6.ip6-privacy</u>
           If ipv6.ip6-privacy is unset, use the content of "<a href="file:/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/default/use_tempaddr">/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/default/use_tempaddr</a>" as
           last fallback.

       <u>ipv6.temp-valid-lifetime</u>
           If ipv6.temp-valid-lifetime is unset, use the content of

       <u>ipv6.temp-preferred-lifetime</u>
           If ipv6.temp-preferred-lifetime is unset, use the content of
           "<a href="file:/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/default/temp_prefered_lft">/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/default/temp_prefered_lft</a>" as last fallback.

       <u>ipv6.required-timeout</u>

       <u>ipv6.route-metric</u>

       <u>ipv6.route-table</u>
           If left unspecified, routes are only added to the main table. Note that this is different from

           the tables.

       <u>loopback.mtu</u>
           If configured explicitly to 0, the MTU is not reconfigured during device activation unless it is
           required due to IPv6 constraints. If left unspecified, a DHCP/IPv6 SLAAC provided value is used or
           the MTU is left unspecified on activation.

       <u>macsec.offload</u>

           If left unspecified, it defaults to "preserve".

       <u>wifi.generate-mac-address-mask</u>

       <u>wifi.mac-address-randomization</u>
           If left unspecified, MAC address randomization is disabled. This setting is deprecated for
           wifi.cloned-mac-address.

       <u>wifi.mtu</u>
           If configured explicitly to 0, the MTU is not reconfigured during device activation unless it is
           required due to IPv6 constraints. If left unspecified, a DHCP/IPv6 SLAAC provided value is used or a
           default of 1500.

       <u>wifi.powersave</u>

       <u>wifi.wake-on-wlan</u>

       <u>wireguard.mtu</u>

   <b>Sections</b>
       You can configure multiple connection sections, by having different sections with a name that all start
       with "connection". Example:

           [connection]
           ipv6.ip6-privacy=0
           connection.autoconnect-ports=1
           vpn.timeout=120

           [connection-wifi-wlan0]
           match-device=interface-name:wlan0
           ipv4.route-metric=50

           [connection-wifi-other]
           match-device=type:wifi
           ipv4.route-metric=55
           ipv6.ip6-privacy=1

       The sections within one file are considered in order of appearance, with the exception that the
       [connection] section is always considered last. In the example above, this order is
       [connection-wifi-wlan0], [connection-wlan-other], and [connection]. When checking for a default
       configuration value, the sections are searched until the requested value is found. In the example above,
       "ipv4.route-metric" for wlan0 interface is set to 50, and for all other Wi-Fi typed interfaces to 55.
       Also, Wi-Fi devices would have IPv6 private addresses enabled by default, but other devices would have it
       disabled. Note that also "wlan0" gets "ipv6.ip6-privacy=1", because although the section
       "[connection-wifi-wlan0]" matches the device, it does not contain that property and the search continues.

       When having different sections in multiple files, sections from files that are read later have higher
       priority. So within one file the priority of the sections is top-to-bottom. Across multiple files later
       definitions take precedence.

       The following properties further control how a connection section applies.

       <u>match-device</u>
           An optional device spec that restricts when the section applies. See the section called “Device List
           Format” for the possible values.

       <u>stop-match</u>
           An optional boolean value which defaults to no. If the section matches (based on match-device),
           further sections will not be considered even if the property in question is not present. In the
           example above, if [connection-wifi-wlan0] would have stop-match set to yes, the device wlan0 would
           have ipv6.ip6-privacy property unspecified. That is, the search for the property would not continue
           in the connection sections [connection-wifi-other] or [connection].

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       Contains per-device persistent configuration.

       Example:

           [device]
           match-device=interface-name:eth3
           managed=1

   <b>Supported</b> <b>Properties</b>
       The following properties can be configured per-device.

       <u>managed</u>
           Whether the device is managed or not. A device can be marked as managed via udev rules
           (ENV{NM_UNMANAGED}), or via setting plugins (keyfile.unmanaged-devices). This is yet another way.
           Note that this configuration can be overruled at runtime via D-Bus. Also, it has higher priority then
           udev rules.

       <u>carrier-wait-timeout</u>
           Specify the timeout for waiting for carrier in milliseconds. The default is 6000 milliseconds. This
           setting exists because certain drivers/hardware can take a long time to detect whether the cable is
           plugged in.

           When the device loses carrier, NetworkManager does not react immediately. Instead, it waits for this
           timeout before considering the link lost.

           Also, on startup, NetworkManager considers the device as busy for this time, as long as the device
           has no carrier. This delays startup-complete signal and NetworkManager-wait-online. Configuring this
           too high means to block NetworkManager-wait-online longer than necessary when booting with cable
           unplugged. Configuring it too low, means that NetworkManager will declare startup-complete too soon,
           although carrier is about to come and auto-activation to kick in. Note that if a profile only has
           static IP configuration or Layer 3 configuration disabled, then it can already autoconnect without
           carrier on the device. Once such a profile reaches full activated state, startup-complete is
           considered as reached even if the device has no carrier yet.

       <u>ignore-carrier</u>
           Specify devices for which NetworkManager will (partially) ignore the carrier state. Normally, for
           device types that support carrier-detect, such as Ethernet and InfiniBand, NetworkManager will only
           allow a connection to be activated on the device if carrier is present (ie, a cable is plugged in),
           and it will deactivate the device if carrier drops for more than a few seconds.

           A device with carrier ignored will allow activating connections on that device even when it does not
           have carrier, provided that the connection uses only statically-configured IP addresses.
           Additionally, it will allow any active connection (whether static or dynamic) to remain active on the
           device when carrier is lost.

           Note that the "carrier" property of NMDevices and device D-Bus interfaces will still reflect the
           actual device state; it's just that NetworkManager will not make use of that information.

           Master types like bond, bridge and team ignore carrier by default, while other device types react on
           carrier changes by default.

           This setting overwrites the deprecated main.ignore-carrier setting above.

       <u>keep-configuration</u>
           On startup, NetworkManager tries to not interfere with interfaces that are already configured. It
           does so by generating a in-memory connection based on the interface current configuration.

           If this generated connection matches one of the existing persistent connections, the persistent
           connection gets activated. If there is no match, the generated connection gets activated as
           "external", which means that the connection is considered as active, but NetworkManager doesn't
           actually touch the interface.

           It is possible to disable this behavior by setting keep-configuration to no. In this way, on startup
           NetworkManager always tries to activate the most suitable persistent connection (the one with highest
           autoconnect-priority or, in case of a tie, the one activated most recently).

           Note that when NetworkManager gets restarted, it stores the previous state in /run/NetworkManager; in
           particular it saves the UUID of the connection that was previously active so that it can be activated
           again after the restart. Therefore, keep-configuration does not have any effect on service restart.

       <u>allowed-connections</u>
           A list of connections that can be activated on the device. See the section called “Connection List
           Format” for the syntax to specify a connection. If this option is not specified, all connections can
           be potentially activated on the device, provided that the connection type and other settings match.

           A notable use case for this is to filter which connections can be activated based on how they were
           created; see the origin keyword in the section called “Connection List Format”.

       <u>wifi.scan-rand-mac-address</u>
           Configures MAC address randomization of a Wi-Fi device during scanning. This defaults to yes in which
           case a random, locally-administered MAC address will be used. The setting
           wifi.scan-generate-mac-address-mask allows to influence the generated MAC address to use certain
           vendor OUIs. If disabled, the MAC address during scanning is left unchanged to whatever is
           configured. For the configured MAC address while the device is associated, see instead the
           per-connection setting wifi.cloned-mac-address.

       <u>wifi.backend</u>
           Specify the Wi-Fi backend used for the device. Currently, supported are wpa_supplicant and iwd
           (experimental). If unspecified, the default is "wpa_supplicant".

       <u>wifi.scan-generate-mac-address-mask</u>
           Like the per-connection settings ethernet.generate-mac-address-mask and
           wifi.generate-mac-address-mask, this allows to configure the generated MAC addresses during scanning.
           See <b><a href="../man5/nm-settings-nmcli.5.html">nm-settings-nmcli</a></b>(5) for details.

       <u>wifi.iwd.autoconnect</u>
           If wifi.backend is iwd, setting this to false forces IWD's autoconnect mechanism to be disabled for
           this device and connections will only be initiated by NetworkManager whether commanded by a client or
           automatically. Leaving it true (default) stops NetworkManager from automatically initiating
           connections and allows IWD to use its network ranking and scanning logic to decide the best networks
           to autoconnect to next. Connections' autoconnect-priority, autoconnect-retries settings will be
           ignored. Other settings like permissions or multi-connect may interfere with IWD connection attempts.

       <u>sriov-num-vfs</u>
           Specify the number of virtual functions (VF) to enable for a PCI physical device that supports
           single-root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV).

   <b>Sections</b>
       The [device] section works the same as the [connection] section. That is, multiple sections that all
       start with the prefix "device" can be specified. The settings "match-device" and "stop-match" are
       available to match a device section on a device. The order of multiple sections is also top-down within
       the file and later files overwrite previous settings. See “Sections” under the section called “CONNECTION
       SECTION” for details.

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTIVITY</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       This section controls NetworkManager's optional connectivity checking functionality. This allows
       NetworkManager to detect whether or not the system can actually access the internet or whether it is
       behind a captive portal.

       Connectivity checking serves two purposes. For one, it exposes a connectivity state on D-Bus, which other
       applications may use. For example, Gnome's portal helper uses this as signal to show a captive portal
       login page. The other use is that default-route of devices without global connectivity get a penalty of
       +20000 to the route-metric. This has the purpose to give a better default-route to devices that have
       global connectivity. For example, when being connected to WWAN and to a Wi-Fi network which is behind a
       captive portal, WWAN still gets preferred until login.

       Note that your distribution might set <a href="file:/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/">/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/</a>*/rp_filter to strict filtering. That works
       badly with per-device connectivity checking, which uses SO_BINDDEVICE to send requests on all devices. A
       strict rp_filter setting will reject any response and the connectivity check on all but the best route
       will fail.

       <u>enabled</u>
           Whether connectivity check is enabled. Note that to enable connectivity check, a valid uri must also
           be configured. The value defaults to true, but since the uri is unset by default, connectivity check
           may be disabled. The main purpose of this option is to have a single flag to disable connectivity
           check. Note that this setting can also be set via D-Bus API at runtime. In that case, the value gets
           stored in /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager-intern.conf file.

       <u>uri</u>
           The URI of a web page to periodically request when connectivity is being checked. This page should
           return the header "X-NetworkManager-Status" with a value of "online". Alternatively, its body content
           should be set to "NetworkManager is online". The body content check can be controlled by the response
           option. If this option is blank or missing, connectivity checking is disabled.

       <u>interval</u>
           Specified in seconds; controls how often connectivity is checked when a network connection exists. If
           set to 0 connectivity checking is disabled. If missing, the default is 300 seconds.

       <u>timeout</u>
           Specified in seconds; controls how long to wait for a response before connectivity is marked as
           limited. If missing, the default is 20 seconds.

       <u>response</u>
           If set, controls what body content NetworkManager checks for when requesting the URI for connectivity
           checking. Note that this only compares that the HTTP response starts with the specified text, it does
           not compare the exact string. This behavior might change in the future, so avoid relying on it. If
           missing, the response defaults to "NetworkManager is online". If set to empty, the HTTP server is
           expected to answer with status code 204 or send no data.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL-DNS</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       This section specifies DNS settings that are applied globally, in addition to connection-specific ones.

       <u>searches</u>
           A list of search domains to be used during hostname lookup.

       <u>options</u>
           A list of options to be passed to the hostname resolver.

       <u>resolve-mode</u>
           String indicating how DNS servers retrieved from global configuration and connections should be used.
           backup - Indicates that they can be freely merged and used for the same purposes.  prefer - Forbids
           DNS servers retrieved from connections to be used for general queries that are not subdomains of
           domains set by connection.  exclusive - Forbids use of connection DNS servers for any query.
           Currently relevant only for Dnsconfd plugin.

       <u>certification-authority</u>
           String specifying absolute path to bundle of CA certificates that must be used for validation of
           certificates presented by DNS servers when encrypted DNS is used. Currently relevant only for
           Dnsconfd plugin.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL-DNS-DOMAIN</b> <b>SECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Sections with a name starting with the "global-dns-domain-" prefix allow to define global DNS
       configuration for specific domains. The part of section name after "global-dns-domain-" specifies the
       domain name a section applies to (for example, a section could be named "global-dns-domain-foobar.com").
       More specific domains have the precedence over less specific ones and the default domain is represented
       by the wildcard "*". To be valid, global DNS domains must include a section for the default domain "*".
       When the global DNS domains are valid, the name servers and domains defined globally override the ones
       from active connections.

       <u>servers</u>
           A list of addresses of DNS servers to be used for the given domain. Each server can be specified
           either as a plain IP address or with a URI syntax. When it is specified as an URI, the following
           forms are supported:

               dns+udp://<u>ADDRESS</u>[:<u>PORT</u>]                 : DNS
               dns+tls://<u>ADDRESS</u>[:<u>PORT</u>][#<u>SERVERNAME]</u>    : DNS over TLS

           <u>ADDRESS</u> is an IPv4 or IPv6 address. When it is IPv6, it must be enclosed in square brackets ('[' and
           ']'). When it is a IPv6 link-local address, the address should be followed by a percent sign ('%')
           and an interface name.

       <u>options</u>
           A list of domain-specific DNS options. Not used at the moment.

</pre><h4><b>.CONFIG</b> <b>SECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This is a special section that contains options which apply to the configuration file that contains the
       option.

       <u>enable</u>
           Defaults to "true". If "false", the configuration file will be skipped during loading. Note that the
           main configuration file NetworkManager.conf cannot be disabled.

               # always skip loading the config file
               [.config]
               enable=false

           You can also match against the version of NetworkManager. For example the following are valid
           configurations:

               # only load on version 1.0.6
               [.config]
               enable=nm-version:1.0.6

               # load on all versions 1.0.x, but not 1.2.x
               [.config]
               enable=nm-version:1.0

               # only load on versions &gt;= 1.1.6. This does not match
               # with version 1.2.0 or 1.4.4. Only the last digit is considered.
               [.config]
               enable=nm-version-min:1.1.6

               # only load on versions &gt;= 1.2. Contrary to the previous
               # example, this also matches with 1.2.0, 1.2.10, 1.4.4, etc.
               [.config]
               enable=nm-version-min:1.2

               # Match against the maximum allowed version. The example matches
               # versions 1.2.0, 1.2.2, 1.2.4. Again, only the last version digit
               # is allowed to be smaller. So this would not match on 1.1.10.
               [.config]
               enable=nm-version-max:1.2.6

           You can also match against the value of the environment variable NM_CONFIG_ENABLE_TAG, like:

               # only load the file when running NetworkManager with
               # environment variable "NM_CONFIG_ENABLE_TAG=TAG1"
               [.config]
               enable=env:TAG1

           More then one match can be specified. The configuration will be enabled if one of the predicates
           matches ("or"). The special prefix "except:" can be used to negate the match. Note that if one
           except-predicate matches, the entire configuration will be disabled. In other words, a except
           predicate always wins over other predicates. If the setting only consists of "except:" matches and
           none of the negative conditions are satisfied, the configuration is still enabled.

               # enable the configuration either when the environment variable
               # is present or the version is at least 1.2.0.
               [.config]
               enable=env:TAG2,nm-version-min:1.2

               # enable the configuration for version &gt;= 1.2.0, but disable
               # it when the environment variable is set to "TAG3"
               [.config]
               enable=except:env:TAG3,nm-version-min:1.2

               # enable the configuration on &gt;= 1.3, &gt;= 1.2.6, and &gt;= 1.0.16.
               # Useful if a certain feature is only present since those releases.
               [.config]
               enable=nm-version-min:1.3,nm-version-min:1.2.6,nm-version-min:1.0.16

</pre><h4><b>PLUGINS</b></h4><pre>
       Settings plugins for reading and writing connection profiles. The number of available plugins is
       distribution specific.

       <u>keyfile</u>
           The keyfile plugin is the generic plugin that supports all the connection types and capabilities that
           NetworkManager has. It writes files out in an .ini-style format in
           /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections. See <b><a href="../man5/nm-settings-keyfile.5.html">nm-settings-keyfile</a></b>(5) for details about the file format.

           The stored connection file may contain passwords, secrets and private keys in plain text, so it will
           be made readable only to root, and the plugin will ignore files that are readable or writable by any
           user or group other than root. See "Secret flag types" in <b><a href="../man5/nm-settings-nmcli.5.html">nm-settings-nmcli</a></b>(5) for how to avoid
           storing passwords in plain text.

           This plugin is always active, and will automatically be used to store any connections that aren't
           supported by any other active plugin.

       <u>ifcfg-rh</u>
           This plugin is now deprecated; it can be used on the Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux
           distributions to read and write configuration from the standard
           /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* files. It currently supports reading Ethernet, Wi-Fi,
           InfiniBand, VLAN, Bond, Bridge, and Team connections. Enabling ifcfg-rh implicitly enables ibft
           plugin, if it is available. This can be disabled by adding no-ibft. See
           /usr/share/doc/initscripts/sysconfig.txt and <b><a href="../man5/nm-settings-ifcfg-rh.5.html">nm-settings-ifcfg-rh</a></b>(5) for more information about the
           ifcfg file format.

       <u>ifupdown</u>
           This plugin is used on the Debian and Ubuntu distributions, and reads Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections
           from /etc/network/interfaces.

           This plugin is read-only; any connections (of any type) added from within NetworkManager when you are
           using this plugin will be saved using the keyfile plugin instead.

       <u>ibft</u>, <u>no-ibft</u>
           These plugins are deprecated and their selection has no effect. This is now handled by
           nm-initrd-generator.

       <u>ifcfg-suse</u>, <u>ifnet</u>
           These plugins are deprecated and their selection has no effect. The keyfile plugin should be used
           instead.

</pre><h4><b>APPENDIX</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Device</b> <b>List</b> <b>Format</b>
       The configuration options main.no-auto-default, main.ignore-carrier, keyfile.unmanaged-devices,
       connection*.match-device and device*.match-device select devices based on a list of matchings. Devices
       can be specified using the following format:

       *
           Matches every device.

       IFNAME
           Case sensitive match of interface name of the device. Globbing is not supported.

       HWADDR
           Match the permanent MAC address of the device. Globbing is not supported

       interface-name:IFNAME, interface-name:~IFNAME
           Case sensitive match of interface name of the device. Simple globbing is supported with * and ?.
           Ranges and escaping is not supported.

       interface-name:=IFNAME
           Case sensitive match of interface name of the device. Globbing is disabled and IFNAME is taken
           literally.

       mac:HWADDR
           Match the permanent MAC address of the device. Globbing is not supported

       s390-subchannels:HWADDR
           Match the device based on the subchannel address. Globbing is not supported

       type:TYPE
           Match the device type. Valid type names are as reported by "nmcli -f GENERAL.TYPE device show".
           Globbing is not supported.

       driver:DRIVER
           Match the device driver as reported by "nmcli -f GENERAL.DRIVER,GENERAL.DRIVER-VERSION device show".
           "DRIVER" must match the driver name exactly and does not support globbing. Optionally, a driver
           version may be specified separated by '/'. Globbing is supported for the version.

       dhcp-plugin:DHCP
           Match the configured DHCP plugin "main.dhcp".

       except:SPEC
           Negative match of a device.  SPEC must be explicitly qualified with a prefix such as interface-name:.
           A negative match has higher priority then the positive matches above.

           If there is a list consisting only of negative matches, the behavior is the same as if there is also
           match-all. That means, if none of all the negative matches is satisfied, the overall result is still
           a positive match. That means, "except:interface-name:eth0" is the same as
           "*,except:interface-name:eth0".

       SPEC[,;]SPEC
           Multiple specs can be concatenated with commas or semicolons. The order does not matter as matches
           are either inclusive or negative (except:), with negative matches having higher priority.

           Backslash is supported to escape the separators ';' and ',', and to express special characters such
           as newline ('\n'), tabulator ('\t'), whitespace ('\s') and backslash ('\\'). The globbing of
           interface names cannot be escaped. Whitespace is not a separator but will be trimmed between two
           specs (unless escaped as '\s').

       Example:

           interface-name:em4
           mac:00:22:68:1c:59:b1;mac:00:1E:65:30:D1:C4;interface-name:eth2
           interface-name:vboxnet*,except:interface-name:vboxnet2
           *,except:mac:00:22:68:1c:59:b1

   <b>Connection</b> <b>List</b> <b>Format</b>
       Connections can be specified using the following format:

       *
           Matches every connection.

       uuid:UUID
           Match the connection by UUID, for example "uuid:83037490-1d17-4986-a397-01f1db3a7fc2"

       id=ID
           Match the connection by name.

       origin:ORIGIN
           Match the connection by origin, stored in the org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.origin tag of the user
           setting. For example, use "except:origin:nm-initrd-generator" to forbid activation of connections
           created by the initrd generator.

       except:SPEC
           Negative match of a connection. A negative match has higher priority then the positive matches above.

           If there is a list consisting only of negative matches, the behavior is the same as if there is also
           match-all. That means, if none of all the negative matches is satisfied, the overall result is still
           a positive match.

       SPEC[,;]SPEC
           Multiple specs can be concatenated with commas or semicolons. The order does not matter as matches
           are either inclusive or negative (except:), with negative matches having higher priority.

           Backslash is supported to escape the separators ';' and ',', and to express special characters such
           as newline ('\n'), tabulator ('\t'), whitespace ('\s') and backslash ('\\'). Whitespace is not a
           separator but will be trimmed between two specs (unless escaped as '\s').
