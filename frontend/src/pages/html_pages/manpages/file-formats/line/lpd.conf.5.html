</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lpd.conf - configuration file for the LPRng line printer spooler system

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  file  <b>lpd.conf</b> is used to provide configuration information for the LPRng Printer spooler system and
       defaults for printcap information.  Leading spaces on lines are ignored, and blank lines and lines  whose
       first  nonblank  character  is a sharp (``#'') are ignored.  Trailing blanks and tabs (whitespace) for an
       option value are deleted unless the last one is escaped  with  a  backslash  (``\'').   All  other  lines
       specify parameters and should be of the following form:
              keyword
              keyword@
              keyword#value
              keyword=value
       Note  that  these  values  are  the  same  format as <b><a href="../man5/printcap.5.html">printcap</a></b>(5) values.  Values in the configuration can
       contain host or machine dependent information; to assist with this, the following <u>escape</u> <u>sequences</u> in the
       configuration information are replaced as follows:

       <b>%h</b>     the short form of the host name (i.e.- non fully qualified).

       <b>%H</b>     the fully qualified host name.

       <b>%a</b>     the abbreviated architecture name, <u>sun4</u>, <u>sol2</u>, <u>hpux</u>, <u>aix</u>, <u>irix5</u>, etc.  This value can be set using
              the <b>architecture</b> keyword in the configuration file and is set to a default value at compile_time.

       <b>%P</b>     the printer name from the printcap entry (see below).

       <b>%R</b>     the remote printer name from the printcap entry.

       <b>%M</b>     the remote host name from the printcap entry.  This is truncated to the short host name.

       For example, on host <u>dickory.sdsu.edu,</u>  the  strings  <u>short=</u><b>%h</b>  <u>long=</u><b>%H</b>  <u>arch=</u><b>%a</b>  would  be  expanded  as
       <u>short=dickory</u> <u>long=dickory.sdsu.edu</u> <u>arch=sun4</u> <u>.</u>

       The  P,  R,  and M tags are provided for use with combined configuration and printcap information.  These
       values are not expanded when the printcap information is initially processed, and can be used only  in  a
       limited  number  of  printcap  or  other entries.  Currently only the printcap :sd: (spool directory) and
       :forward_server: (forward server) entries use these.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       Some of the following parameters take lists of files or directories.  Unless otherwise explicitly stated,
       these lists can be separated by commas (,), semicolons (;), or colons, (punctuation) and possibly tabs or
       spaces (whitespace) as well.

       Keyword names can use either underscores (_) or hyphens  (-)  in  their  names,  but  the  underscore  is
       preferred.

       <b>include</b> pathname [pathname*] (no default)
              This can be used to include files into the <b>lpd.conf</b> file.  The include file parameter a whitespace
              separated list of files; the files must have absolute pathnames and must be readable.

       <b>ae</b> (default: "jobend $H $n $P $k $b $t")
              This  specifies  either  a  script  or  a filter to be invoked at the send of a job for accounting
              purposes.  See <b>as</b> for the matching accounting at start, and the <b><a href="../man5/printcap.5.html">printcap</a></b>(5) and <b><a href="../man8/lpd.8.html">lpd</a></b>(8)  man  pages
              for details.

       <b>allow_getenv</b> (default: "LPD_CONF")
              This option specifies an environment variable whose value is a configuration file.  Use of this is
              restricted  to  test  purposes,  and SUID ROOT client and server will not run when the variable is
              enabled.

              value  of this parameter is set at compile time and it is used when expanding the special sequence
              <b>%a</b> in pathname and filename strings in this config file.

       <b>auth</b> (default: NULL)
              Authentication type to be used for client to server communication.

       <b>auth_receive_filter</b> (default: NULL)
              Program to be used by server receive server or client communication.

       <b>auth_server_id</b> (default: NULL)
              Authentication id of originating client or server.

       <b>as</b> (default: "jobstart $H $n $P $k $b $t")
              See <b>as</b>.

       <b>bk</b> (default: no)
              See <b><a href="../man5/printcap.5.html">printcap</a></b>(5) for details.

       <b>bk_filter_options</b>
              (default: "$P $w $l $x $y $F $c $L $i $J $C $0n $0h  $-a")  If  the  "bkf"  (backwards  compatible
              filter)  flags  is set in the printcap entry and the original filter specification does not have a
              `$` in it, this option string is appended to a filter specification, and the string expanded  with
              values from the printcap information and job information.  (see of_filter_options, filter_options,
              bk_filter_options, bk_of_filter_options)

       <b>bk_of_filter_options</b>
              (default:  "$w  $l $x $y") If the "bkf" (backwards compatible filter) flags is set in the printcap
              entry and the original filter specification does not have a `$`  in  it,  this  option  string  is
              appended  to  the  OF  filter specification, and the string expanded with values from the printcap
              information and  job  information.   (see  of_filter_options,  filter_options,  bk_filter_options,
              bk_of_filter_options)

       <b>check_for_nonprintable</b> (default: "")
              (Used  by  LPR)  check  f  and  p  formats  for  non_printable characters unless <b>-b</b> (binary) or <b>-l</b>
              (literal) command_line option is supplied. Note  that  files  containing  HPGL  or  other  printer
              control languages would often be classed as ``non_printable''.

       <b>connect_grace</b> (default: 0 seconds)
              The  time  to pause before opening a new connection to a printer.  This allows the printer time to
              recover from the previous job.

       <b>connect_interval</b> (default: 10 (seconds))
              The time to pause after a failed connection or open of the printing device before attempting a new
              connection or open.

       <b>connect_timeout</b> (default: 10 (seconds))
              The time to wait for a device open or connection to complete.  A zero value is infinite timeout.

       <b>retry_nolink</b> (default: true)
              When TRUE and the LPD server is printing or transferring a  job,  then  an  indefinite  number  of
              attempts to connect to or open the IO device will be made.

       <b>default_banner_printer</b> (default: "")
              The  default  banner printer program to be used for printing banners.  This should be specified in
              the LPD configuration file.

       <b>default_format</b> (default: "f")
              Default format for printing jobs.

       <b>default_logger_port</b>
              (default: 2001) specifies a default port number for logger  information.   See  logger_destination
              for details.

       <b>default_logger_protocol</b>
              (default:  UDP)  specifies  a default protocol for logger information.  See logger_destination for
              details.

       <b>default_permission</b> (default: ACCEPT)
              Default permission for operations.

       <b>default_printer</b> (default: "")
              The default printer to use if there is no PRINTER environment variable, the user has not specified
              a printer, or there is no printcap information.

       <b>default_priority</b> (default: "A")
              Default priority (class) for printing jobs.  This is also used as the job class.

       <b>default_remote_host</b> (default: "%H")
              The default remote host to use.

       <b>default_tmp_dir</b> (default: <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>)
              Directory for temporary files.

       <b>domain_name</b> (default: "")
              This parameter is optional, and is appended to the hostname to  make  it  into  a  fully_qualified
              domain  name,  ie. <u>class.iona.ie</u>. It will only be used if the software cannot determine the domain
              name using other means, such as <b><a href="../man3n/gethostbyname.3n.html">gethostbyname</a>(3n)</b>.

       <b>ff</b> (default: \f)
              Formfeed string.

       <b>filter_ld_path</b>
              (default: ) The value for the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH, both used when executing,  and
              passed on to filters.  This variable is used to find shared libraries on SunOS, Solaris and Linux.

       <b>filter_options</b>
              (default:  "$C $F $H $J $L $P $Q $R $Z $a $c $d $e $f $h $i $j $k $l $n $p $r $s $w $x $y $-a") If
              the "bkf" (backwards compatible filter) flags is not set in the printcap entry  and  the  original
              filter  specification  does  not  have  a  `$`  in  it, this option string is appended to a filter
              specification, and the  string  expanded  with  values  from  the  printcap  information  and  job
              information.  (see of_filter_options, filter_options, bk_filter_options, bk_of_filter_options)

       <b>filter_path</b>
              (default:  <a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>) The value for the environment variable PATH, both used to
              find filters and passed on to filters run by <b>lpd</b> and <b>lpr</b>.

       <b>force_poll</b> (default: no)
              Some software packages put print jobs directly into the spool queues.  The <b>force_poll</b> flag  forces
              lpd to periodically poll spool queues looking for jobs and no server.  The <b>poll_time</b> variable sets
              the interval between polls.

       <b>full_time</b> (default: no)
              Use full time and date format in logging and error messages.

       <b>fx</b> (default: "")
              See <b><a href="../man5/printcap.5.html">printcap</a></b>(5) for details.  This specifies the job formats allowed for this queue.

       <b>group</b> (default "daemon")
              The  group  to  use for file ownership and process permissions.  Used only by lpd; this can be the
              name of a group or a number.  All filters will run as the specified group.  Note that if the group
              value is 0, then the real user group of the process at startup will be used.

       <b>kerberos_keytab</b> (default "/etc/lpd.keytab")
              The keytab file to be used by the LPD server when using  built-in  kerberos  authentication.   The
              keytab  file  should  be  owned by the LPD server, and be readable/writable only by it (i.e. - 600
              permissions).

       <b>kerberos_life</b> (default NULL)
              The lifetime of a Kerberos ticket.  NULL selects the default lifetime.  Time should  be  specified
              using the standard Kerberos time representations.

       <b>kerberos_forward_principal</b> (default NULL)
              remote principal used by server when forwarding

       <b>kerberos_renew</b> (default NULL)
              The  renewal of a Kerberos ticket.  NULL selects a non-renewable ticket.  Time should be specified
              using the standard Kerberos time representations.

       <b>kerberos_server_principal</b> (default "lpr")
              Server principal used when client sending to server or when server is  originating  connection  to
              another server for forwarding.

       <b>kerberos_service</b> (default "lpr")
              The  service name used to make requests to the LPD server when using kerberos authentication.  For
              example, if kerberos_service has the value lpr, the server is on host alpha.com, and the  kerberos
              domain is ALPHA.COM, then the kerberos principal name would be:
              lpr/<a href="mailto:alpha.com@ALPHA.COM">alpha.com@ALPHA.COM</a>.

       <b>la</b> (default: yes)
              See <b><a href="../man5/printcap.5.html">printcap</a></b>(5) for details.

       <b>lf</b> (default: log)
              Name of the log file.

       <b>lo</b> (default: lock)
              Name of the lock file.

       <b>localhost</b>
              (default  "localhost")  The  name  of  the  localhost  entry  to  be  used for the TCP/IP loopback
              interface.  The TCP/IP connection may originate from the local host; use this name to check to see
              if the local host address is in the IP address database, and use it as the origination address for
              local connections.   This  is  done  to  avoid  problems  with  multi-homed  hosts  who  originate
              connections from different interfaces.

       <b>lockfile</b> (default: /var/spool/lpd/lpd)
              The  file  used to indicate the presence of an <b>lpd</b> server running on the host.  The lpd_port value
              is appended to the lockfile value to provide a unique lockfile even  when  different  versions  of
              LPRng are running on the same system.

       <b>logger_destination</b>
              (default:  "")  This  specifies  a destination for logger information generated by the lpd server.
              The  formation  of  the  destination  specification  is  host[%port][,(TCP|UDP)].   For   example,
              localhost%2001,UDP  would  send logger information to the localhost IP address, on port 2001 using
              the UPD protocol.   The  default  port  and  protocol  are  set  by  the  default_logger_port  and
              default_logger_protocol configuration variables respectively.

       <b>longnumber</b>
              (default:  no)  RFC1179  requires  3  digit  job numbers; setting longnumber to yes allows 6 digit
              numbers.  If the backwards_compatible flag is set, only 3 digit numbers will be used.

       <b>lpd_listen_port</b> (default: =off) [ipaddr%]port
              The port that <b>lpd</b> binds to.  If the parameter is set to off then <b>lpd</b> does not listen  to  any  TCP
              port.  See <b>lpd_port</b> for details of the format of the argument.

              If this is not set at all, then <b>lpdP</b> <b>will</b> <b>listen</b> <b>on</b> <b>lpd_port.</b>

       <b>lpd_port</b> (default: <u>printer</u>)  [ipaddr%]port
              The port that <b>lpr</b> and the other client programs send their requests to.  The specification has the
              format  ipaddr%port.   If the IP address is specified then a bind to only this address and port is
              done.  If the port value is not a number a service  lookup  is  performed  and  the  corresponding
              service  port is used; see <a href="../man5/services.5.html">services</a>(5).  This parameter is useful for debugging a new installation
              of LPRng, in that running LPRng on a different port from the default will  not  interfere  with  a
              previous installation of LPD or LPRng.

       <b>lpd_printcap_path</b> (default: "")
              The  location  of  <b>lpd</b>  server  only  printcap  database  information.   If  this  is nonblank the
              <b>printcap_pathP</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>lpd</b> server.

       <b>mail_operator_on_error</b> (default: "")
              Put this person on the CC-list of the mail, if it is not a success mail. (So in  addition  to  the
              person  who  made  the  printer  request,  also  this  person  gets error messages, but no success
              messages.)

       <b>max_status_line</b> (default: 79)
              An integer value specifying the numbers of characters to be used for displaying simple job status;
              this includes the queue position, job identifier,  job contents, size, and time.  A 0 (zero) value
              indicates no restrictions.

       <b>max_status_size</b> (default: 10 (Kbytes))
              An integer value specifying (in K bytes) the maximum size of  the  status  file  to  be  generated
              during  printing  operations.   A  0 value will create unlimited size status files.  When the file
              size exceeds this value, it is truncated to <b>min_status_size</b> K bytes.

       <b>mc</b> (default: 1)
              See <b><a href="../man5/printcap.5.html">printcap</a></b>(5) for details.

       <b>min_status_size</b> (default: 0 (Kbytes))
              Minimum status size.  If 0, defaults to 20 percent of max_status_size.

       <b>minfree</b> (default: 0)
              The amount of free space (in Kbytes) needed in the spool directory  in  order  for  a  job  to  be
              accepted.   If  0, there is no limit; if the parameter is the name of a file rather than a number,
              the file must contain a numerical minimum free value (in Kbytes).  This value is overridden by the
              printcap <u>mi</u> field value.

       <b>ms_time_resolution</b>
              (default: FALSE) This flag causes the time information to  be  printed  to  millisecond  accuracy.
              This is overkill for most purposes.

       <b>of_filter_options</b>
              (default:  "")  If  this  is  not set, the value defaults to the same as the filter_options value.
              This string is appended to a OF filter specification, and the string expanded with values from the
              printcap information and job information.  If the "bkf" (backwards compatible filter) flags is set
              in the printcap entry, of bk_of_filter_options value is appended instead  (see  of_filter_options,
              filter_options, bk_filter_options, bk_of_filter_options)

       <b>originate_port</b>
              (default:  "721  731")  A  range of port numbers to originate requests from.  When sending service
              requests, the software will try to open and bind to these  ports  to  originate  a  request  to  a
              server.  If no port is given, or all of the requested ports are unavailable or cannot be bound to,
              then  a normal use port is requested.  Note that on UNIX systems, if a port in the range 0-1023 is
              requested the EUID of the process must be root for the request to be granted.  Note  that  RFC1179
              specifies that requests must originate from ports in the range 721-731.

       <b>pass_env</b>
              (default:                                "LANG,LC_CTYPE,LC_NUMERIC,LC_TIME,LC_COLLATE,LC_MONETARY,
              LC_MESSAGES,LC_PAPER,LC_NAME,LC_ADDRESS,LC_TELEPHONE,LC_MEASUREMENT,    LC_IDENTIFICATION,LC_ALL")
              Client  programs  such  as  LPR,  LPC,  etc.,  will pass these environment variables to any filter
              programs they start.

       <b>poll_time</b> (default: 6000)
              Interval in seconds at which LPD checks for queues with jobs and no server active.  See <b>force_poll</b>
              as well.

       <b>pl</b> (default: 66)
              See <b><a href="../man5/printcap.5.html">printcap</a></b>(5) for details.

       <b>pr</b> (default: <a href="file:/bin/pr">/bin/pr</a>)
              See <b><a href="../man5/printcap.5.html">printcap</a></b>(5) for details.

       <b>printcap_path</b>
              (default: "/etc/printcap") The location of the printcap database file.  If a file or  filter  does
              not  exist,  it  is considered a fatal error.  All valid entries in these files will be used.  See
              PRINTCAP LOOKUP for details.

       <b>perms_path</b>
              (default: /etc/lpd.perms:/usr/etc/lpd.perms:  /var/spool/lpd/lpd.perms.%h)  The  location  of  the
              printer  permissions database.  If a file or filter does not exist, it is skipped.  The first file
              or filter that exists and is readable will be used.  See PERMISSIONS LOOKUP for details.

       <b>pw</b> (default: 80)
              See <b><a href="../man5/printcap.5.html">printcap</a></b>(5) for details.

       <b>save_on_error</b>
              (default: no) Save a job in the spool queue if it has an error rather than removing it.

       <b>save_when_done</b>
              (default: no) Save a job in the spool queue after completion rather than removing it.

       <b>send_data_first</b>
              (default: no) Send data files of a job first, followed by the control file.

       <b>send_failure_action</b> (default: "")
              The lpd server uses this to determine the action to take when unable to print or  process  a  job.
              The keyword <u>abort</u> will cause it to terminate operations, leaving the job in the queue, <u>remove</u> will
              cause  it  to remove the job, <u>retry</u> will cause it to retry the job, and <u>hold</u> will cause it to hold
              the job with an error indication.  If the value is a filter, then the filter will be  invoked  and
              the exit status of the filter used to determine the actions.

       <b>send_job_rw_timeout</b> (default: 6000)
              When  printing  or  sending a job to a remote printer, use this as a write to the device or remote
              host  timeout  value.   If  a  timeout  occurs,  then  a  FAIL  status   is   returned   and   the
              send_failure_action value is used to determine what to do on failure.

       <b>send_try</b> (default: 3)
              Numbers  of times to try to send a job to the printer or remote host.  A 0 value means an infinite
              number of times.

       <b>sendmail</b> (default: "/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -t")
              If the argument is empty then all mail_related functionality is disabled.  The arguments  are  the
              command  to  run when mail is to be sent.  The command used needs to be able to accept the message
              on stdin, with <u>no</u> arguments.  The message will contain the <b>To:</b>, <b>From:</b>, <b>Cc:</b> and <b>Subject:</b> headers.

       <b>server_tmp_dir</b> (default: <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>)
              Temporary dir for the server.

       <b>spool_dir_perms</b> (default: 042700)
              Permissions of the spool directories.

       <b>spool_file_perms</b> (default: 0600)
              Permissions of the spool files.

       <b>syslog_device</b> (default: /dev/console)
              Log to this device if all else fails.

       <b>unix_socket_path</b> (default: /var/run/lprng/socket)
              Location of the Unix socket that lpd listens on and LPRng clients attempt to communicate  to  when
              host is localhost. Set to <u>off</u> to disable listening and connecting via a Unix socket.

       <b>use_date</b> (default: no)
              No information about this parameter available.

       <b>use_identifier</b> (default: no)
              Add a job identifier line to the control file, using the 'A' entry in the control file.

       <b>use_info_cache</b> (default: yes)
              If  this  is  set to <u>yes</u>, lpd.perms and printcap information lookups will be cached for later use.
              Only lookups in the main databases will be cached, not lookups in the per_printer databases.   You
              can force the <b>lpd</b> to flush its cache and reread the permissions file by sending it a SIGHUP.

       <b>use_queuename</b> (default: no)
              Put  an  entry into control files identifying the spool queue the job was originally sent to.  The
              entry has the form 'Qspoolname', and its value can be passed  to  filters.   This  is  useful  for
              setting up a spool queue which formats jobs in different ways, depending on the name of the queue.

       <b>use_shorthost</b> (default: no)
              By  default,  names  of lpr job files used the originating host fully qualified domain name.  This
              can exceed 14 characters, the limit of file names on some UNIX systems.  If this is  set  to  <u>yes</u>,
              the  non-qualified  name  will be used, and if the host name is at most 8 characters the file name
              will be at most 14 characters long.

       <b>user</b> (default: daemon)
              The user that <b>lpd</b> and its filters runs as, and the  owner  of  the  spool  directories  and  other
              lpd_writable files.  This can be the name of a user or a number.  If the user value is 0, then the
              real  UID  of  the  program  when  started  will be used.  This allows a non_root user to test the
              functionality of the LRPng software.

</pre><h4><b>PRINTCAP</b> <b>LOOKUP,</b> <b>DATABASE</b> <b>FILES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       The printcap_path and printer_perms_path variables specify a list of either data base files or filters to
       use to get printcap or permission entries for a printer.  To get information, the filter is started and a
       single line with the printer name is sent to it.  Note that the printer  name  <u>all</u>  is  used  to  request
       information  either about all printers, or a specific printer entry that has a list of all printers.  See
       <b><a href="../man5/printcap.5.html">printcap</a></b>(5) for more details.

       To find the printcap  information,  LPRng  programs  will  read  the  database  files  specified  in  the
       <u>printcap_path</u>  entry.   The  <u>lpd</u> server will read any additional files specified in the <u>lpd_printcap_path</u>
       entry.  If any of the files is missing or non-readable a fatal error will result.  After having  searched
       the  various  files,  if  a filter has been specified the filter will be started and the required printer
       name will be sent to the filter.  The output from the filter will be used as the printcap information.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY-RELATED</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       Environment variables are sanitized by <b>lpd</b>  and  the  other  executables,  in  that  the  variables  <u>IFS</u>,
       <u>LD_PRELOAD</u>  and  <u>LD_PROFILE</u>  are  all  deleted  from  the  environment  passed  to  filters and any other
       sub_processes.  For more reliability, script filters  should  set  their  own  PATH  and  LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       variables.

       All filters will run as the user and group specified by the group and user variables.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>

       #   The values in this file are the default values.
       #   If you modify the file,  set the value to something other than the default
       #   For example, '# default force_localhost' means
       #     the 'force_localhost' option value is on or 1.
       #   Uncomment this and change it to read 'force_localhost@'

       # Purpose: always print banner, ignore lpr -h option
       #   default ab@
       # Purpose: query accounting server when connected
       #   default achk@
       # Purpose: accounting at end (see also af, la, ar, as)
       #   default ae=jobend $H $n $P $k $b $t
       # Purpose: name of accounting file (see also la, ar)
       #   default af=
       af=acct
       # Purpose: automatically hold all jobs
       #   default ah@
       ah

       #   default allow_duplicate_args@

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  files  used  by  LPRng  are  set  by  values in the printer configuration file.  The following are a
       commonly used set of default values.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Most of the diagnostics are self explanatory.
       If you are puzzled over the exact cause of failure,
       set the debugging level on (-D5) and run again.
       The debugging information will
       help you to pinpoint the exact cause of failure.
