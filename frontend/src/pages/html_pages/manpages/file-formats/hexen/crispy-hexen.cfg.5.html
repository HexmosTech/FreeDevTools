</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       crispy-hexen.cfg - Crispy Hexen configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>crispy-hexen.cfg</u>  is  a  configuration  file  for  <b><a href="../man6/crispy-hexen.6.html">crispy-hexen</a></b>(6).   This  file  acts  as  an  auxiliary
       configuration file; the main configuration options are stored  in  <b>hexen.cfg</b>,  which  contains  the  same
       configuration  options  as  Vanilla  Hexen  (for compatibility).  <u>crispy-hexen.cfg</u> contains configuration
       options that are specific to Crispy-Hexen only.

       <u>crispy-hexen.cfg</u>     is     normally     stored     in     the     user's     home     directory,      as
       <u><a href="file:~/.local/share/crispy-hexen/crispy-hexen.cfg">~/.local/share/crispy-hexen/crispy-hexen.cfg</a></u>.   The  path  can  be  overridden  using  the  <b>XDG_DATA_HOME</b>
       environment variable (see the XDG Base Directory Specification).

       The <b><a href="../man6/crispy-hexen-setup.6.html">crispy-hexen-setup</a></b>(6) tool provides a simple to use front-end for editing <u>crispy-hexen.cfg</u>.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The file format is the same as that used for <b><a href="../man5/hexen.cfg.5.html">hexen.cfg</a></b>(5).

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>video_driver</b>
              Name of the SDL video driver to use.  If this is an empty string,  the  default  video  driver  is
              used.

       <b>window_position</b>
              Position of the window on the screen when running in windowed mode. Accepted values are: "" (empty
              string)  -  don't  care,  "center" - place window at center of screen, "x,y" - place window at the
              specified coordinates.

       <b>fullscreen</b>
              If non-zero, the game will run in full screen mode.  If zero, the game will run in a window.

       <b>video_display</b>
              Index of the display on which the game should run. This has no effect if running in windowed  mode
              (fullscreen=0) and window_position is not set to "center".

       <b>aspect_ratio_correct</b>
              If  non-zero, the screen will be stretched vertically to display correctly on a square pixel video
              mode.

       <b>integer_scaling</b>
              If non-zero, forces integer scales for resolution-independent rendering.

       <b>window_width</b>
              Window width when running in windowed mode.

       <b>window_height</b>
              Window height when running in windowed mode.

       <b>fullscreen_width</b>
              Width for screen mode when running fullscreen. If this and fullscreen_height are both set to zero,
              we run fullscreen as a desktop window that covers the entire screen, rather  than  ever  switching
              screen modes. It should usually be unnecessary to set this value.

       <b>fullscreen_height</b>
              Height for screen mode when running fullscreen. See documentation for fullscreen_width.

       <b>force_software_renderer</b>
              If  non-zero,  force  the  use  of  a  software  renderer.  For  use  on  systems lacking hardware
              acceleration.

       <b>max_scaling_buffer_pixels</b>
              Maximum number of pixels to use for intermediate scaling buffer. More pixels mean that the  screen
              can  be  rendered more precisely, but there are diminishing returns on quality. The default limits
              to 16,000,000 pixels, which is enough to cover 4K monitor standards.

       <b>startup_delay</b>
              Number of milliseconds to wait on startup after the video mode has been set, before the game  will
              start.  This allows the screen to settle on some monitors that do not display an image for a brief
              interval after changing video modes.

       <b>graphical_startup</b>
              If non-zero, display the graphical startup screen.

       <b>png_screenshots</b>
              If  non-zero,  save  screenshots  in  PNG format. If zero, screenshots are saved in PCX format, as
              Vanilla Doom does.

       <b>mouse_acceleration_y</b>
              Vertical mouse acceleration factor.  When the speed of mouse movement exceeds the threshold  value
              (mouse_threshold), the speed is multiplied by this value.

       <b>mouse_threshold_y</b>
              Vertical  mouse  acceleration  threshold.  When the speed of mouse movement exceeds this threshold
              value, the speed is multiplied by an acceleration factor (mouse_acceleration).

       <b>snd_samplerate</b>
              Sound output sample rate, in Hz.  Typical values to use are 11025, 22050, 44100 and 48000.

       <b>snd_cachesize</b>
              Maximum number of bytes to allocate for caching converted sound effects in memory. If set to zero,
              there is no limit applied.

       <b>snd_maxslicetime_ms</b>
              Maximum size of  the  output  sound  buffer  size  in  milliseconds.  Sound  output  is  generated
              periodically  in  slices.  Higher values might be more efficient but will introduce latency to the
              sound output. The default is 28ms (one slice per tic with the 35fps timer).

       <b>snd_pitchshift</b>
              If non-zero, sound effects will have their pitch varied up or down by a random amount during play.
              If zero, sound effects play back at their default pitch.

       <b>snd_musiccmd</b>
              External command to invoke to perform MIDI playback. If  set  to  the  empty  string,  SDL_mixer's
              internal  MIDI  playback  is used. This only has any effect when snd_musicdevice is set to General
              MIDI output.

       <b>snd_dmxoption</b>
              Value to set for the DMXOPTION environment variable. If this contains "-opl3", output for an  OPL3
              chip is generated when in OPL MIDI playback mode.

       <b>opl_io_port</b>
              The I/O port to use to access the OPL chip.  Only relevant when using native OPL music playback.

       <b>use_libsamplerate</b>
              Controls  whether  libsamplerate  support  is used for performing sample rate conversions of sound
              effects.  Support for this must be compiled into the program. If zero,  libsamplerate  support  is
              disabled.   If  non-zero, libsamplerate is enabled. Increasing values roughly correspond to higher
              quality conversion; the higher the quality, the slower the conversion process.  Linear  conversion
              =  1; Zero order hold = 2; Fast Sinc filter = 3; Medium quality Sinc filter = 4; High quality Sinc
              filter = 5.

       <b>libsamplerate_scale</b>
              Scaling factor used by libsamplerate. This is used when converting  sounds  internally  back  into
              integer  form;  normally  it should not be necessary to change it from the default value. The only
              time it might be needed is if a PWAD file is loaded that contains very loud sounds, in which  case
              the  conversion  may  cause  sound  clipping and the scale factor should be reduced. The lower the
              value, the quieter the sound effects become, so it should be set as high as  is  possible  without
              clipping occurring.

       <b>autoload_path</b>
              Full path to a directory in which WAD files and dehacked patches can be placed to be automatically
              loaded  on startup. A subdirectory of this directory matching the IWAD name is checked to find the
              files to load.

       <b>music_pack_path</b>
              Full path to a directory containing configuration files for substitute music  packs.  These  packs
              contain  high quality renderings of game music to be played instead of using the system's built-in
              MIDI playback.

       <b>fsynth_chorus_active</b>
              If 1, activate the FluidSynth chorus effects module. If 0, no chorus will be added to  the  output
              signal.

              This setting defines how FluidSynth interprets Bank Select messages. The default  is  "gs".  Other
              possible values are "gm", "xg" and "mma".

       <b>fsynth_polyphony</b>
              Sets  the number of FluidSynth voices that can be played in parallel. Default is 256, range is 1 -
              65535.

       <b>fsynth_reverb_active</b>
              If 1, activate the FluidSynth reverb effects module. If 0, no reverb will be added to  the  output
              signal.

       <b>fsynth_reverb_damp</b>

       <b>fsynth_reverb_width</b>
              Sets the stereo spread of the FluidSynth reverb signal. Default is 0.4, range is 0.0 - 100.0.

       <b>fsynth_gain</b>
              Fine tune the FluidSynth output level. Default is 1.0, range is 0.0 - 10.0.

       <b>fsynth_sf_path</b>
              Full path to a soundfont file to use with FluidSynth MIDI playback.

       <b>timidity_cfg_path</b>
              Full  path  to  a Timidity configuration file to use for MIDI playback. The file will be evaluated
              from the directory where it is evaluated, so there is no need to add "dir" commands into it.

       <b>gus_patch_path</b>
              Path to GUS patch files to use when operating in GUS emulation mode.

       <b>gus_ram_kb</b>

              waiting for the game to start.

       <b>grabmouse</b>
              If this is non-zero, the mouse will be "grabbed" when running in windowed mode so that it  can  be
              used as an input device. When running full screen, this has no effect.

       <b>novert</b> If  non-zero,  all vertical mouse movement is ignored.  This emulates the behavior of the "novert"
              tool available under DOS that performs the same function.

       <b>mouse_acceleration</b>
              Mouse acceleration factor.   When  the  speed  of  mouse  movement  exceeds  the  threshold  value
