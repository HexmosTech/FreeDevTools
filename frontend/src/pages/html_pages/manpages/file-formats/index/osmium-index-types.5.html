       osmium-index-types - Index types used to store node locations

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>osmium</b>  <b>add-locations-to-ways</b> and <b>osmium</b> <b>export</b> commands have to keep an index of the node locations
       in memory or in a temporary file on disk while doing their work.  There are several different  ways  this
       can be done which have different advantages and disadvantages.

       Use  the <b>--show-index-types/-I</b> option on these commands to show all available index types.  It depends on
       your operating system which index types are available.

       Use the <b>--index-type/-i</b> option on these commands to set the index type to be used.

       The default index type is flex_mem which will keep all data in memory and works  for  small  extracts  as
       well as the whole planet file.  It is the right choice for almost all use cases if you have enough memory
       to keep the whole index in memory.

       For  the  <b>osmium</b>  <b>export</b>  command,  the  special  type none is used when reading from files with the node
       locations on the ways.  (See <b><a href="../man1/osmium-add-node-locations-to-ways.1.html">osmium-add-node-locations-to-ways</a></b>(1) for how to get a file like this.)

       You can use one of the file-based indexes for the  node  location  store  to  minimize  memory  use,  but
       performance  will suffer.  In this case use sparse_file_array if you have a small or medium sized extract
       and dense_file_array if you are working with a full planet or a really large extract.

       When using the file-based index types (*_file_array), add the filename you want  to  use  for  the  index
       after a comma to the index types like so:

       ... -i dense_file_array,index.dat ...

</pre><h4><b>MEMORY</b> <b>USE</b></h4><pre>
       It depends on the index type used how much memory is needed:

       • For sparse_*_array types 16 bytes per node in the input file are used.

       • For dense_*_array types 8 bytes times the largest node ID in the input file are used.

       The *_mem_* types use potentially up to twice this amount.

       The *mem* and *mmap* types store the data in memory, the *file* types in a file on disk.

       The  flex_mem  type  automatically  switches  between  something similar to sparse_mmap_array for smaller
       extracts and dense_mmap_array for larger extracts or the whole planet file.

       If you specify the <b>--verbose/-v</b> option, Osmium will display how much memory was used for the index.
