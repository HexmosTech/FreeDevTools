</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       minidlna.conf — MiniDLNA server configuration file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/minidlna.conf</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man1/minidlnad.1.html">minidlnad</a></u>(1)  reads  configuration options from the system-wide configuration file <u>/etc/minidlna.conf</u>, or
       the file specified with <b>-f</b> on the command line. The file contains keyword-argument pairs, one  per  line.
       Lines starting with ‘#’ and empty lines are interpreted as comments.

       The possible keywords and their meanings are as follows:

       <b>album_art_names</b>
               List  of  filenames to check for when searching for album art cache, separated by forward slashes
               (‘/’).  This option can be specified more than once.

       <b>db_dir</b>  Path to the directory <b>minidlnad</b> should use to store  its  database  and  album  art  cache.  Uses
               <u>/var/lib/minidlna</u> by default.

       <b>enable_tivo</b>
               Support  for  streaming  .jpg  and  .mp3  files  to a TiVo supporting HMO. Set to “yes” to enable
               support for streaming JPEG and mp3 files to  a  TiVo  supporting  HMO.   Set  to  “no”  (default)
               otherwise.

       <b>friendly_name</b>
               Customize the name that the <b>minidlnad</b> server sends to clients. Defaults to “hostname: username”.

       <b>force_sort_criteria</b>
               Always  set  SortCriteria  to this value, regardless of the SortCriteria passed by the clien t. (
               E.g. force_sort_criteria=+upnp:class,+upnp:originalTrackNumber,+dc:title )

       <b>inotify</b>
               Set to “yes” to enable inotify monitoring of the files under <b>media_dir</b> to automatically  discover
               new files. Set to “no” to disable inotify.

       <b>network_interface</b>
               Comma separated list of network interfaces to bind to. Default is empty which means bind to all.

       <b>log_dir</b>
               Path  to  the  directory where the log file should be stored. Defaults to <u>/var/log/minidlna</u>.  Not
               used when "systemd" mode is activated with -S switch.

       <b>log_level</b>
               Defines the type of messages that should be logged, and down to which level  of  importance  they
               should be considered.

               The   possible  types  are  “artwork”,  “database”,  “general”,  “http”,  “inotify”,  “metadata”,
               “scanner”, “ssdp” and “tivo”.

               The levels are “off”, “fatal”, “error”, “warn”, “info” and  “debug”,  listed  here  in  order  of
               decreasing importance.  “off” turns off logging messages entirely, “fatal” logs the most critical
               messages only, and so on down to “debug” that logs every single messages.

               The  types are comma-separated, followed by an equal sign (‘=’), followed by a level that applies
               to the preceding types. This can be repeated, separating each of these constructs with a comma.

               Defaults to  “general,artwork,database,inotify,scanner,metadata,http,ssdp,tivo=warn”  which  logs
               every type of message at the “warn” level.

       <b>max_connections</b>
               Specify  maximum number of simultaneous connections. Note: many clients open several simultaneous
               connections while streaming.

       <b>media_dir</b>
               Path to the directory containing the media files the <b>minidlnad</b>  server  should  share.  Use  this
               option  several  times  if  you  have more than one directory to share. To restrict a path to one
               specific media type, you can use the following syntax: the letter ‘A’, ‘V’ or ‘P’, followed by  a
               comma (‘,’) followed by the path. The meaning of the first letter is as follows:
                     <b>•</b>   ‘A’ for audio files;
                     <b>•</b>   ‘V’ for video files;
                     <b>•</b>   ‘P’ for image files.

               For example, if you want to include only video files located in /srv/multimedia/videos directory,
               and only music in /srv/multimedia/music, then you would use
                      media_dir=V,/srv/multimedia/videos
                      media_dir=A,/srv/multimedia/music

               Another example would be
                      media_dir=V,/srv/multimedia/videos
                      media_dir=V,/srv/multimedia/movies
                      media_dir=A,/srv/multimedia/music

               Or, if you did not care what type it finds, then you could use
                      media_dir=/srv/multimedia/videos
                      media_dir=/srv/multimedia/movies
                      media_dir=/srv/multimedia/music

               You can mix it up, find anything in music, but only Videos, in videos and movies
                      media_dir=V,/srv/multimedia/videos
                      media_dir=V,/srv/multimedia/movies
                      media_dir=/srv/multimedia/music

       <b>merge_media_dirs</b>
               Merge all media_dir base contents into the root container. The default value is no.

       <b>minissdpdsocket</b>
               Path  to  the MiniSSDPd socket, if you want to use <b>minidlnad</b> together with MiniSSDPd. Defaults to
               <u>/run/minissdpd.sock</u>.

       <b>model_name</b>
               Set the  model  name  reported  to  clients.   Defaults  to  “Windows  Media  Connect  compatible
               (MiniDLNA)”.

       <b>model_number</b>
               Set the model number reported to clients. Defaults to the version number of <b>minidlnad</b>.

       <b>network_interface</b>
               Network  interface(s)  to bind to (e.g. eth0), comma delimited. This option can be specified more
               than once. If unspecified or empty, <b>minidlnad</b> binds to all the valid network  interfaces  (except
               loopback).

       <b>notify_interval</b>
               Set the notify interval, in seconds. The default is 895 seconds.

       <b>port</b>    Port  number  for  HTTP  traffic  (descriptions, SOAP, media transfe).  This option is mandatory,
               unless the port number is specified on the command-line using <b>-p</b> (see <u><a href="../man1/minidlnad.1.html">minidlnad</a></u>(1)).

       <b>presentation_url</b>
               Define the URL presented to clients (e.g. “<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>:80”).  The default is ‘/’.

       <b>root_container</b>
               Use a different container as the root of the tree exposed to clients. The possible values
                     <b>•</b>   ‘.’ to use the standard container (this is the default);
                     <b>•</b>   ‘B’ to use the “Browse Directory” container;
                     <b>•</b>   ‘M’ to use the “Music” container;
                     <b>•</b>   ‘V’ to use the “Video” container;
                     <b>•</b>   ‘P’ to use the “Pictures” container.
               If you specify ‘B’ and the client device is audio only, then “Music/Folders” will be used as  the
               root container.

       <b>serial</b>  Set the serial number reported to clients. Defaults to MAC address od network interface.

       <b>strict_dlna</b>
               Set  to  “yes”  to  strictly adhere to DLNA standards. This will allow server-side downscaling of
               very large JPEG images, which may hurt JPEG serving performance on (at least) Sony DLNA products.
               Set to “no” otherwise.

       <b>tivo_discovery</b>
               Which method to use for registering in TiVo. By default “bonjour” is  used.  You  can  switch  to
               legacy “beacon” method.

       <b>user</b>    Specify  the  user  name  or  UID to run as. Beware that if you are using an init system to start
               <b>minidlnad</b>,  then  this  option  has  no  effect  and  you  should  override   default   user   in
               <u>minidlna.service</u> for systemd or set USER in <u>/etc/default/minidlna</u> for sysV init.

       <b>uuid</b>    Specify  device's  UPnP  UUID  minidlna  should use. By default MAC address is used to build uniq
               UUID.

       <b>wide_links</b>
               Set to “yes” to allow symlinks that  point  outside  user-defined  <b>media_dir.</b>  By  default,  wide
               symlinks are not followed.

       <b>enable_subtitles</b>
               Set to “no” to disable subtitles support for unknown clients.

       <b>enable_thumbnail</b>
               Set  to  “yes”  to  enable  thumbnails generation for video files.  To use this option, thumbnail
               generation must be  enable  at  compile  time.  See  the  following  options  to  set  thumbnails
               parameters.

       <b>thumbnail_width</b>
