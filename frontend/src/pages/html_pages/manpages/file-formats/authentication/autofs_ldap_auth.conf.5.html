</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       autofs_ldap_auth.conf - autofs LDAP authentication configuration

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       LDAP  authenticated binds, TLS encrypted connections and certification may be used by setting appropriate
       values in the autofs authentication configuration file and configuring the LDAP client  with  appropriate
       settings.   The default location of this file is <b>/etc/autofs_ldap_auth.conf</b>.  If this file exists it will
       be used to establish whether TLS or authentication should be used.

       An example of this file is:

         &lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;
         &lt;autofs_ldap_sasl_conf
                 usetls="yes"
                 tlsrequired="no"
                 authrequired="no"
                 authtype="DIGEST-MD5"
                 user="xyz"
                 secret="abc"
         /&gt;

       If TLS encryption is to be used the location of the Certificate Authority certificate must be set  within
       the  LDAP  client configuration in order to validate the server certificate. If, in addition, a certified
       connection is to be used then the client certificate and private key file locations must also be  config‐
       ured within the LDAP client.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This files contains a single XML element, as shown in the example above, with several attributes.

       The possible attributes are:

       <b>usetls="yes"|"no"</b>
              Determines whether an encrypted connection to the ldap server should be attempted.

       <b>tlsrequired="yes"|"no"</b>
              This  flag  tells  whether the ldap connection must be encrypted. If set to "yes", the automounter
              will fail to start if an encrypted connection cannot be established.

       <b>authrequired="yes"|"no"|"autodetect"|"simple"</b>
              This option tells whether an authenticated connection to the ldap server is required in  order  to
              perform  ldap  queries. If the flag is set to yes, only sasl authenticated connections will be al‐
              lowed. If it is set to no then authentication is not needed for ldap server connections. If it  is
              set to autodetect then the ldap server will be queried to establish a suitable sasl authentication
              mechanism.  If no suitable mechanism can be found, connections to the ldap server are made without
              authentication. Finally, if it is set to simple, then simple authentication will be  used  instead
              of SASL.

       <b>authtype="GSSAPI"|"LOGIN"|"PLAIN"|"ANONYMOUS"|"DIGEST-MD5"|"SCRAM-SHA-1"|"EXTERNAL"</b>
              This attribute can be used to specify a preferred authentication mechanism.  In normal operations,
              the  automounter  will  attempt  to  authenticate  to the ldap server using the list of supported‐
              SASLmechanisms obtained from the directory server.  Explicitly setting the  authtype  will  bypass
              this selection and only try the mechanism specified. The EXTERNAL mechanism may be used to authen‐
              ticate  using  a  client  certificate  and requires that authrequired set to "yes" if using SSL or
              usetls, tlsrequired and authrequired all set to "yes" if using TLS, in addition to authtype  being
              set to EXTERNAL.

              If using authtype EXTERNAL two additional configuration entries are required:

              <b>external_cert="&lt;client</b> <b>certificate</b> <b>path&gt;"</b>

              This specifies the path of the file containing the client certificate.

              <b>external_key="&lt;client</b> <b>certificate</b> <b>key</b> <b>path&gt;"</b>

              This specifies the path of the file containing the client certificate key.

              These  two configuration entries are mandatory when using the EXTERNAL method as the HOME environ‐
              ment variable cannot be assumed to be set or, if it is, to be set to the location we expect.

       <b>user="&lt;username&gt;"</b>
              This attribute holds the authentication identity used by authentication  mechanisms  that  require
              it.   Legal values for this attribute include any printable characters that can be used by the se‐
              lected authentication mechanism.

       <b>secret="&lt;password&gt;"</b>
              This attribute holds the secret used by authentication mechanisms that require  it.  Legal  values
              for  this  attribute include any printable characters that can be used by the selected authentica‐
              tion mechanism.

       <b>encoded_secret="&lt;base64</b> <b>encoded</b> <b>password&gt;"</b>
              This attribute holds the base64 encoded secret used by authentication mechanisms that require  it.
              If this entry is present as well as the secret entry this value will take precedence.

       <b>clientprinc="&lt;GSSAPI</b> <b>client</b> <b>principal&gt;"</b>
              When  using  GSSAPI authentication, this attribute is consulted to determine the principal name to
              use when authenticating to the  directory  server.  By  default,  this  will  be  set  to  "autof‐
              sclient/&lt;fqdn&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;.

       <b>credentialcache="&lt;external</b> <b>credential</b> <b>cache</b> <b>path&gt;"</b>
              When  using  GSSAPI authentication, this attribute can be used to specify an externally configured
              credential cache that is used during authentication.  By default, autofs will setup a memory based
              credential cache.
