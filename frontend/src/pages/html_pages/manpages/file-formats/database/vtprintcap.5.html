</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       vtprintcap - database of terminal printer control codes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/vtprintcap</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtprintcap</b>  is  a  simple  flat file database containing a list of the names of various terminals and the
       codes those terminals use to start and stop an attached printer (media hard copy). This database is  used
       by <b><a href="../man1/vtprint.1.html">vtprint</a></b>(1) and related programs.

       Each  entry  is  composed of three lines.  The first line is a comma-delimited list of names which may be
       used to reference this entry.  The second line the sequence of characters used by the terminal to turn on
       an attached hard copy device and redirect output to that device.   The third line contains  the  sequence
       of characters used to turn the device off and restore normal output to the screen.

       An  entry  must have all three lines to be considered valid.  Currently no comment lines are permitted to
       exist between these lines: such lines would be interpreted as the printer control codes themselves!

       The rules for selecting a terminal name are simple: you must follow the same rules as for <b>/etc/<a href="../man5/termcap.5.html">termcap</a></b>(5)
       names.  Terminal names should be entered in <b>/etc/vtprintcap</b>  with  exactly  the  same  names  as  are  in
       <b>/etc/termcap</b>.

       The  control code strings in the second and third lines of an entry are governed as follows: ANSI C style
       escapes for character constants (e.g. \n for newline) are permitted, constant strings are permitted,  and
       quotes  may  be  used  to  as  delimiters  in  the  string.   (This is useful if you wish you use a digit
       immediately following a numeric escape. For example, ESC-5 should be  represented  as  \033"5"  to  avoid
       confusion in with \335.  In general, the rules outlined for ANSI constant escaping are enforced.

       Additionally,  <b>/etc/vtprintcap</b>  may contain comment lines, which are indicated by placing a hash mark (#)
       in the first column of the line.  Remember however that entries must <u>not</u> be broken up by comment lines!

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a sample entry common to DEC vt100 and vt102 terminals:

              # Sample vtprintcap entry for vt100 &amp; vt102 terminals
              vt100, vt102
              \033[5i
              \033[4i

       This entry would be used whenever the user's TERM environment variable was set  to  "vt102"  or  "vt100",
       using ESC [5i and ESC [4i as the printer control codes to turn a printer on and off, respectively.

</pre><h4><b>DISTRIBUTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtprintcap</b>  is part of the <b>vtprint</b> package, which can be obtained by anonymous ftp at ftp.sdsu.edu in the
       <b>/pub/vtprint</b> directory.  Please read the <b>INDEX</b> and <b>README</b> files before downloading.

       If you do not have ftp availability, then you can request a uuencoded copy of <b>vtprint</b> be sent to you  via
       e-mail  from the author.  The author is also willing to make other arrangements as needed, within certain
       limitations.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/termcap</b>
       <b>/etc/vtprintcap</b>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtprintcap</b> handling code currently could get confused if a printer control code is exactly  the  same  as
       the  name  of  a  terminal,  or  contained  the  name of a terminal delimited by commas.  As this is very
       unlikely to every occur, it shouldn't be a problem.
