</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ModuleTrx.conf - Configuration file for the SvxLink transceiver control module

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>svxlink</b>  is  a general purpose voice service system for ham radio use. This man-page describe the SvxLink
       server configuration for the transceiver control module.

       The transceiver control module is used to remotely control and operate a transceiver  through  a  SvxLink
       node.  The module is configured by setting up one or more bands to operate the transceiver on. It is even
       possible to support multiple transceivers by having multiple band definitions but with differing  RX  and
       TX configurations. This make it possible to for example support HF, VHF, UHF etc using the same module.

       It  is only possible to select the operating frequency through the command interface but with intelligent
       band configurations it is possible to select the modulation and other parameters  as  well,  like  listen
       only bands.

       It  is  also  possible to select a band through a shortcut. The configured default frequency for the band
       will then be selected. Single frequency channels are configured by setting up a band that span  only  one
       frequency.  The  channel  can  then  be selected by either entering a possibly configured shortcut or the
       frequency for the channel.

       When entering a frequency on the control interface, a band is selected that match the entered  frequency.
       If  there  are more than one band that match the frequency there are some rules for which of the bands to
       select.

              •   If the new frequency falls within a band that is a subband of another  band,  the  subband  is
                  selected.  This  make  it  possible to configure regions of a larger band differently than the
                  whole band, like making parts of a band listen only or selecting another modulation.  It  also
                  make it possible to define channels within the band that have different settings like repeater
                  shift.

              •   If the new frequency falls within a band that is overlapping with the current band but that is
                  not  a  subband  of  the  current  band,  the  band  having the lowest valued shortcut will be
                  selected. If there is no shortcut configured, the band with the lowest lower  frequency  limit
                  will be selected.

              •   If  there is a band currently selected and the new band is not a subband, the transceiver will
                  prefer to stay on the current band. Another band can  be  selected  explicitly  by  setting  a
                  shortcut on it and first use that shortcut to switch to the other band.

              •   If the above rules does not appy it is undefined which band get selected.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  a  couple  of  configuration variables that are common to all modules.  The documentation for
       these can be found in the <b><a href="../man5/svxlink.conf.5.html">svxlink.conf</a></b>(5) manual page.

       Here is the description of all module specific  configuration  variables  that  the  SvxLink  transceiver
       control  module  understands.  The  configuration file consists of one global section, that by default is
       called ModuleTrx, and then there are one or more band configuration sections.  The  global  configuration
       variables will serve as a default for all band configuration sections.

   <b>ModuleTrx</b>
       <b>RX</b>     Specify  a  receiver configuration section in the same way that it is done in the rest of SvxLink.
              It is even possible to use receivers defined in other SvxLink configuration files. If  a  receiver
              is  defined  in  the ModuleTrx configuration file it is good practise, but not required, to prefix
              the configuration section name with <b>ModuleTrx:</b>, like <b>[ModuleTrx:Rx1]</b>.

       <b>TX</b>     Specify a transmitter configuration section in the same way  that  it  is  done  in  the  rest  of
              SvxLink.  It is even possible to use transmitters defined in other SvxLink configuration files. If
              a transmitter is defined in the  ModuleTrx  configuration  file  it  is  good  practise,  but  not
              required, to prefix the configuration section name with <b>ModuleTrx:</b>, like <b>[ModuleTrx:Tx1]</b>.

       <b>RX_TIMEOUT</b>
              Specify  a  timeout,  in seconds, after which the audio is suppressed from the receiver. The audio
              will be suppressed until the squelch is closed.

       <b>MODULATION</b>
              Specify which modulation to use. For a list of valid modulations, have a look at the documentation
              for the MODULATION variable in the <b><a href="../man5/svxlink.conf.5.html">svxlink.conf</a></b>(5) manual page.

       <b>SHIFT</b>  Specify the repeater shift (e.g. split transmit frequency) in kHz.

   <b>Band</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Section</b>
       A band specific configuration section must be named like [ModuleTrx:Band:BANDNAME], where BANDNAME should
       be replaced with a unique band name.

       A band specific configuration section may contain the  same  variables  that  is  listed  above  for  the
       ModuleTrx  section.  Setting  the  corresponding  configuration  variable  here  will override the global
       default. A band configuration section may in addition have the following configuration variables.

       <b>FQ</b>     This variable is required and define the lower and upper frequencies for the band. The frequencies
              are in kHz and should be given on the form lower-upper.  For  a  single  frequency  band  (i.e.  a
              channel) it is sufficient to only specify the first frequency.

       <b>FQ_DEFAULT</b>
              This  is  the  default  frequency in kHz for a band. It is used to set the initial frequency for a
              band that is selected through a shortcut. If it is not set, the lower band limit will be  used  as
              the default frequency.

       <b>SHORTCUT</b>
              Define a shortcut for a band. The shortcut may be any positive number except 0-9 which is reserved
              for  module  commands.  If the shortcut match a command entered on the command interface, the band
              will be selected immediately and the frequency set by FQ_DEFAULT will be set.  If  more  than  one
              band have the same shortcut it is undefined which one will get selected.
