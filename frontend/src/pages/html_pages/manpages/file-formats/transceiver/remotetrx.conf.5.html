</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       remotetrx.conf - Configuration file for the SvxLink remote transceiver server

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>remotetrx</b>  is the SvxLink remote transceiver server. This man-page describe the configuration file format
       for it.

       The RemoteTrx application can handle more than one transceiver at a time. You may  for  example  want  to
       handle  both  a  2m  and a 70cm receiver on a site. One sound card is sufficient for doing this since the
       left channel can be used for one receiver and the right channel can be used for the other receiver.   The
       GLOBAL/TRXS  configuration  variable  is used to tell the RemoteTrx application which transceivers to set
       up. Each transceiver have an uplink that is used to interface to the main SvxLink server. The most common
       type is the net uplink which link to the main SvxLink server over the Internet using TCP/IP.  It is  also
       possible to have an uplink via RF but the functionality is then limited.

       The  term  "uplink"  might  be  a  bit  confusing  for some people. In this case it does not refer to any
       specific direction in which the data or audio is flowing. It's just the name for the link up to the  main
       SvxLink server.

       RemoteTrx  look  for  configuration  files  in a number of places. First it tries to find a user specific
       configuration  file.  It  will  look  for  a  user   specific   configuration   file   in   two   places:
       <b>$HOME/.svxlink/remotetrx.conf</b>.   If no user specific configuration file can be found, remotetrx will look
       for the system wide configuration file <b>/etc/svxlink/remotetrx.conf</b>.  The <b>--config</b> command line option may
       also be used to specify an arbitrary configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file is in the famous INI-file format. A generic example of how such a file might  look
       like is shown below.

         [SECTION1]
         VALUE1=1
         VALUE2="TWO "
         VAULE3="Multi "
                "line"

         [SECTION2]
         VALUE1=2

       This  is  a  simple  format  that  contain name=value pairs that belong to a section.  In written text, a
       specific configuration variable can be referred to as  SECTION1/VALUE2  meaning  "configuration  variable
       VALUE2 in section SECTION1".

       The  same  variable name can exist in two different sections. For example VALUE1 in section SECTION1 have
       the value 1 and VALUE1 in section SECTION2 have the value 2. Values containing spaces at the beginning or
       end of the line must be surrounded by citation characters (see SECTION1/VALUE2). Likewise  with  a  multi
       line value (see SECTION1/VALUE3).

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here  is  the  description  of  all configuration variables that remotetrx understands. The configuration
       variables are described section for section.

   <b>GLOBAL</b>
       The GLOBAL section contains application global configuration data.

       <b>TRXS</b>   This configuration variable specify a comma separated list of transceiver configuration sections.

       <b>CFG_DIR</b>
              Specify the path to a directory that contain additional configuration files.  If a  relative  path
              is  specified, the path will be relative to the directory where the main configuration file is at.
              All files in the specified directory will be read as additional configuration. Filenames  starting
              with a dot are ignored.

       <b>TIMESTAMP_FORMAT</b>
              This  variable  specifies  the format of the timestamp that is written in front of each row in the
              log file. The format string is in the same format as specified in the <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3) manual page. The
              default is "%c" which is described as: "the preferred date and time representation for the current
              locale". The environment variables LC_TIME, LC_ALL and LANG will affect how this time format  will
              look.  For  example,  setting LC_TIME="sv_SE.UTF8" will give you swedish timestamp representation.
              Other examples of format specifiers are:

              •   <b>%d</b> - The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31)

              •   <b>%b</b> - The abbreviated month name according to the current locale

              •   <b>%Y</b> - The year as a decimal number including the century

              •   <b>%H</b> - The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23)

              •   <b>%M</b> - The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59)

              •   <b>%S</b> - The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61)

              So, TIMESTAMP_FORMAT="%d %b %Y %H:%M:%S" would give a timestamp looking something  like:  "29  Nov
              2005 22:31:59".

       <b>CARD_SAMPLE_RATE</b>
              This  configuration  variable  determines  the  sampling rate used for audio input/output. SvxLink
              always work with a sampling rate of 16kHz internally but there still are som benefits from using a
              higher sampling rate. On some sound cards the filters look pretty bad at 16kHz and  the  amplitude
              response  will  not  be  uniform which among other things can cause problems for the software DTMF
              decoder.

              Some sound cards also sound very  bad  at  16kHz  due  to  insufficient  anti-alias  filtering  or
              resampling effects. These, often cheeper, sound cards sound OK at 48kHz.

              The  downside of choosing a higher sampling rate is that it puts a little bit more load on the CPU
              so if you have a very slow machine (&lt;300MHz), it might not have the computational power to  handle
              it.

              Supported sampling rates are: 16000 and 48000.

       <b>CARD_CHANNELS</b>
              Use this configuration variable to specify how many channels to use when opening a sound card. For
              normal sound cards the only practical values to use are 1 for mono and 2 for stereo. The latter is
              the default.

              When  using  the  sound  card  in  stereo  mode  it is possible to use the left and right channels
              independenly to drive two transceivers. When using the sound card in  mono  mode,  both  left  and
              right channels transmit/receive the same audio.

   <b>Network</b> <b>uplink</b> <b>transceiver</b> <b>section</b>
       The  network  uplink  transceiver  section is used to specify the configuration for a network link to the
       main SvxLink server. In the default configuration file there is  a  network  uplink  transceiver  section
       called <b>NetUpLinkTrx</b>.

       <b>TYPE</b>   Always "Net" for a network uplink transceiver configuration section.

       <b>RX</b>     Point  out  the receiver configuration section to use. Set to NONE if no RX is used. A receiver is
              configured in the exact same way as in the SvxLink server.  Have a  look  at  <b><a href="../man5/svxlink.conf.5.html">svxlink.conf</a></b>(5)  for
              more information on how to configure a receiver.

       <b>TX</b>     Point  out  the  transmitter  configuration  section  to  use.  Set  to  NONE  if no TX is used. A
              transmitter is configured in the exact same  way  as  in  the  SvxLink  server.  Have  a  look  at
              <b><a href="../man5/svxlink.conf.5.html">svxlink.conf</a></b>(5) for more information on how to configure a transmitter.

       <b>LISTEN_PORT</b>
              The  TCP  port to listen on. Make sure to choose a unique port for each network uplink transceiver
              configuration. The default is 5210.

       <b>AUTH_KEY</b>
              This is the authentication key (password) to use to athenticate incoming connections. The same key
              have to be specified in the client configuration.  If no key is  specified,  all  logins  will  be
              unauthenticated.  A  good  authentication key should be 20 characters long.  The key will never be
              transmitted  over  the  network.  A  HMAC-SHA1  challenge-response  procedure  will  be  used  for
              authentication.

       <b>MUTE_TX_ON_RX</b>
              If  set to a value &gt;= 0, will stop the transmitter from transmitting when the squelch is open. The
              value represents a delay, in milliseconds, after the squelch has closed, that the transmitter will
              be muted. For example, if set to 1000, the transmitter will be muted one second after the  squelch
              has closed.  The default is not to mute the transmitter when the squelch is open.

       <b>FALLBACK_REPEATER</b>
              This  function is useful if running RemoteTrx as both RX and TX for a repeater.  If the connection
              to the SvxLink base station is lost due to network errors, the RemoteTrx  provides  a  very  basic
              repeater function (SQLELCH controlled) until the the connection has been established again. Set to
              1 to enable this function or set to 0 to disable it. Default is 0.

       <b>TX_JITTER_BUFFER_DELAY</b>
              A  jitter buffer is used to prevent gaps in the audio when the network connection do not provide a
              steady flow of data. If you experience choppy TX audio, set this  configuration  variable  to  the
              number of milliseconds to buffer before starting to transmit. Default: 0.

   <b>RF</b> <b>uplink</b> <b>transceiver</b> <b>section</b>
       The  RF  uplink  transceiver configuration section is used to specify the configuration for an RF link to
       the main SvxLink server.  It can for example be used to link remote receivers coming in on  the  Internet
       to  a  site  that  do  not have access to the Internet.  In the default configuration file there is an RF
       uplink transceiver section called <b>RfUpLinkTrx</b>.  The section name could be anything. It should match  what
       is specified in the TRXS configuration variable in the GLOBAL section.

       <b>TYPE</b>   Always "RF" for an RF uplink transceiver configuration section.

       <b>RX</b>     Point  out  the receiver configuration section to use. Set to NONE if no RX is used. A receiver is
              configured in the exact same way as in the SvxLink server.  Have a  look  at  <b><a href="../man5/svxlink.conf.5.html">svxlink.conf</a></b>(5)  for
              more information on how to configure a receiver.

       <b>TX</b>     Point  out  the  transmitter  configuration  section  to  use.  Set  to  NONE  if no TX is used. A
              transmitter is configured in the exact same  way  as  in  the  SvxLink  server.  Have  a  look  at
              <b><a href="../man5/svxlink.conf.5.html">svxlink.conf</a></b>(5) for more information on how to configure a transmitter.

       <b>UPLINK_TX</b>
              Point  out  the  uplink  transmitter configuration section to use. The configuration for an uplink
              transmitter looks exactly the same as for any other transmitter.   In  the  default  configuration
              file  there is an uplink transmitter configuration section called <b>UplinkTx</b>.  If there is no uplink
              transmitter, specify NONE.

       <b>UPLINK_RX</b>
              Point out the uplink receiver configuration section  to  use.  The  configuration  for  an  uplink
              receiver  looks  exactly  the  same  as for any other receiver.  In the default configuration file
              there is an uplink receiver  configuration  section  called  <b>UplinkRx</b>.   If  there  is  no  uplink
              receiver, specify NONE.

       <b>MUTE_UPLINK_RX_ON_TX</b>
              Specify if the link receiver should be muted or not when the link transmitter is transmitting. Set
              it to 0 if a full duplex link is desired. Default is 1.

       <b>LOOP_RX_TO_TX</b>
              Set  to 1 to loop incoming RX audio (not link RX) directly to the TX (not link TX). You figure out
              when to use it. Default is 0.

       <b>DETECT_1750</b>
              Set up the receiver(s) specified in the RX configuration variable to detect a 1750Hz  tone  burst.
              The detection will be relayed on the uplink transmitter if the setup have the capability to do so.
              Set this configuration variable to the number of milliseconds that the 1750Hz tone must be present
              before reporting it. Detection is disabled by default.

       <b>DETECT_CTCSS</b>
              Set  up  the  receiver(s)  specified  in  the  RX configuration variable to detect the given CTCSS
              tone(s). The detection will be relayed on the uplink transmitter if the setup have the  capability
              to  do  so.  Set  this  configuration  variable to a space separated list of tone_fq:tone_duration
              pairs, where tone_fq is the CTCSS tone frequency and tone_duration is the number  of  milliseconds
              that the CTCSS tone must be present before reporting it.
