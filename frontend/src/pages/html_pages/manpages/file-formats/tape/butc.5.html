       butc - Defines Tape Coordinator instructions for automated tape devices

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>CFG_device_name</u> file includes instructions that configure a Tape Coordinator (<b>butc</b>) for use with
       automated backup devices such as tape stackers and jukeboxes, enable the Tape Coordinator to dump and
       restore data to a <u>backup</u> <u>data</u> <u>file</u> on a local disk device, and enable greater automation of other aspects
       of the backup process.

       There is a separate configuration file for each tape device or backup data file. Creating the file is
       optional, and unnecessary if none of the instructions it can include pertain to a given tape device. The
       ASCII-format file must reside in the <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup</u> directory on the Tape Coordinator machine if
       it exists.

       The <u>CFG_device_name</u> file does not replace the <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup/tapeconfig</u> file, a single copy of
       which still must exist on every Tape Coordinator machine.

       To enable the Tape Coordinator to locate the configuration file, construct the variable part of the
       filename, <u>device_name</u>, as follows:

       •   For  a  tape device, strip off the initial "<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>" string from the device name, and replace any other
           slashes in the name with underscores. For example, <u>CFG_rmt_4m</u>  is  the  appropriate  filename  for  a
           device called <u>/dev/rmt/4m</u>.

       •   For  a  backup data file, strip off the initial slash ("/") and replace any other slashes in the name
           with underscores. For example, <u>CFG_var_tmp_FILE</u> is the appropriate filename for a  backup  data  file
           called <u>/var/tmp/FILE</u>.

       The  <u>CFG_device_name</u>  file lists one or more of the following instructions, each on its own line. All are
       optional, and they can appear in any order. A more detailed description of each instruction  follows  the
       list:

       ASK Controls whether the Tape Coordinator prompts for guidance when it encounters error conditions.

       AUTOQUERY
           Controls whether the Tape Coordinator prompts for the first tape.

       BUFFERSIZE
           Sets the size of the memory buffer the Tape Coordinator uses when transferring data.

       FILE
           Controls whether the dump is written to a tape device or a file.

       MOUNT
           Identifies the file that contains routines for inserting tapes into the device's drive.

       NAME_CHECK
           Controls  whether  the  Tape  Coordinator verifies that a tape's AFS tape name matches the dump being
           written.

       UNMOUNT
           Identifies the file that contains routines for removing tapes from the device's drive.

   <b>The</b> <b>ASK</b> <b>Instruction</b>
       The "ASK" instruction takes a boolean value as its argument, in the following format:

          ASK (YES | NO)

       When the value is "YES", the Tape Coordinator generates a prompt in its window, requesting a response  to
       the  error  cases  described in the following list. This is the default behavior if the "ASK" instruction
       does not appear in the <u>CFG_device_name</u> file.

       When the value is "NO", the Tape Coordinator does not  prompt  in  error  cases,  but  instead  uses  the
       automatic  default responses described in the following list. The Tape Coordinator also logs the error in
       the <u>TE_device_name</u> file. Suppressing the prompts enables the Tape Coordinator to run  unattended,  though
       it still prompts for insertion of tapes unless the "MOUNT" instruction is used.

       The error cases controlled by this instruction are the following:

       •   The  Backup  System  is  unable  to dump a volume while running the backup dump command. With a "YES"
           value, the Tape Coordinator prompts to offer three choices: try to dump the volume again immediately,
           omit the volume from the dump but continue the operation, or terminate the  operation.  With  a  "NO"
           value, the Tape Coordinator omits the volume from the dump and continues the operation.

       •   The  Backup  System  is  unable  to  restore  a  volume  while running the <b>backup</b> <b>diskrestore</b>, <b>backup</b>
           <b>volrestore</b>, or <b>backup</b> <b>volsetrestore</b> command. With a "YES" value,  the  Tape  Coordinator  prompts  to
           offer  two  choices:  omit  the  volume  and  continue  restoring the other volumes, or terminate the
           operation. With a "NO" value, it continues the operation without prompting, omitting the  problematic
           volume but restoring the remaining ones.

       •   The  Backup System cannot determine if the dump set includes any more tapes, while running the <b>backup</b>
           <b>scantape</b> command (the reference page for that command discusses possible reasons for  this  problem).
           With  a "YES" value, the Tape Coordinator prompts to ask if there are more tapes to scan. With a "NO"
           value, it proceeds as though there are more tapes and  invokes  the  routine  named  by  the  "MOUNT"
           instruction in the configuration file, or prompts the operator to insert the next tape.

       •   The  Backup  System  determines  that  the  tape  contains an unexpired dump while running the <b>backup</b>
           <b>labeltape</b> command. With a "YES" value, the Tape Coordinator prompts to offer two choices: continue or
           terminate the labeling operation. With a "NO" value, it terminates the operation  without  relabeling
           the tape.

   <b>The</b> <b>AUTOQUERY</b> <b>Instruction</b>
       The "AUTOQUERY" instruction takes a boolean value as its argument, in the following format:

          AUTOQUERY (YES | NO)

       When  the  value  is  "YES", the Tape Coordinator checks for the "MOUNT" instruction in the configuration
       file when it needs to read the first tape involved in an operation. As described for that instruction, it
       then either prompts for the tape or invokes the specified routine to mount the tape. This is the  default
       behavior if the "AUTOQUERY" instruction does not appear in the configuration file.

       When  the  value  is  "NO", the Tape Coordinator assumes that the first tape required for an operation is
       already in the drive. It does not prompt the operator or invoke the "MOUNT" routine unless  there  is  an
       error  in  accessing  the  first tape. This setting is equivalent in effect to including the <b>-noautoquery</b>
       flag to the <b>butc</b> command.

       Note that the setting of the "AUTOQUERY" instruction controls the Tape Coordinator's behavior  only  with
       respect  to  the  first tape required for an operation. For subsequent tapes, the Tape Coordinator always
       checks for the "MOUNT" instruction. It also refers to the "MOUNT" instruction if it encounters  an  error
       while attempting to access the first tape.

   <b>The</b> <b>BUFFERSIZE</b> <b>Instruction</b>
       The "BUFFERSIZE" instruction takes an integer value, and optionally units, in the following format:

          BUFFERSIZE &lt;size&gt;[(k | K | m | M | g | G)]

       where &lt;size&gt; specifies the amount of memory the Tape Coordinator allocates to use as a buffer during both
       dump  and restore operations.  The default unit is bytes, but use "k" or "K" to specify kilobytes, "m" or
       "M" for megabytes, and "g" or "G" for gigabytes. There is no space between the &lt;size&gt; value and the units
       letter.

       By default, the Tape Coordinator uses a 16 KB buffer during dump operations. As it receives  volume  data
       from  the Volume Server, the Tape Coordinator gathers 16 KB of data in the buffer before transferring the
       entire 16 KB to the tape device or backup data file. Similarly,  during  a  restore  operation  the  Tape
       Coordinator by default buffers 32 KB of data from the tape device or backup data file before transferring
       the entire 32 KB to the Volume Server for restoration into the file system. Buffering makes the volume of
       data  flowing  to  and  from  a  tape  device more even and so promotes tape streaming, which is the most
       efficient way for a tape device to operate.

       In a normal network configuration, the default buffer sizes are usually  large  enough  to  promote  tape
       streaming.  If  the network between the Tape Coordinator machine and file server machines is slow, it can
       help to increase the buffer size.

   <b>The</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>Instruction</b>
       The "FILE" instruction takes a boolean value as its argument, in the following format:

          FILE (NO | YES)

       When the value is "NO", the Tape Coordinator writes to a tape device during a dump  operation  and  reads
       from  one  during  a  restore  operation. This is the default behavior if the "FILE" instruction does not
       appear in the configuration file.

       When the value is "YES", the Tape Coordinator writes volume data to a backup data file on the local  disk
       during  a  dump  operation and reads volume data from a file during a restore operation. If the file does
       not exist when the Tape Coordinator attempts to access it to write a dump, the Tape  Coordinator  creates
       it. For a restore operation to succeed, the file must exist and contain volume data previously written to
       it by a <b>backup</b> <b>dump</b> operation.

       When  the  value  is "YES", the backup data file's complete pathname must appear (instead of a tape drive
       device  name)  in  the  third  field  of   the   corresponding   port   offset   entry   in   the   local
       <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup/tapeconfig</u>  file.  If  the field instead refers to a tape device, dump operations
       appear to succeed but are inoperative. It is not possible to restore data that was accidently dumped to a
       tape device while the "FILE" instruction was set to "YES". (In the same way, if the "FILE" instruction is
       set to "NO", the <u>tapeconfig</u> entry must refer to an actual tape device.)

       Rather than put an actual file pathname  in  the  third  field  of  the  <u>tapeconfig</u>  file,  however,  the
       recommended  configuration  is  to create a symbolic link in the <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> directory that points to the actual
       file pathname, and record the symbolic link in this field. This configuration has a couple of advantages:

       •   It makes the <u>device_name</u> portion of the <u>CFG_device_name</u>, <u>TE_device_name</u>, and <u>TL_device_name</u> names  as
           short  as  possible.  Because  the  symbolic  link  is in the <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> directory as though it were a tape
           device, the device configuration file's name is constructed by stripping off the entire <u><a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a></u> prefix,
           instead of just the initial slash. If, for example, the symbolic link is called <u>/dev/FILE</u>, the device
           configuration file name is <u>CFG_FILE</u>, whereas if the actual  pathname  <u>/var/tmp/FILE</u>  appears  in  the
           <b>tapeconfig</b> file, the file's name must be <u>CFG_var_tmp_FILE</u>.

       •   It  provides  for a more graceful, and potentially automated, recovery if the Tape Coordinator cannot
           write a complete dump into the backup data file (because the partition housing the backup  data  file
           becomes  full, for example). The Tape Coordinator's reaction to this problem is to invoke the "MOUNT"
           script, or to prompt the operator if the "MOUNT" instruction does not  appear  in  the  configuration
           file.

           •   If there is a "MOUNT" routine, the operator can prepare for this situation by adding a subroutine
               that changes the symbolic link to point to another backup data file on a partition where there is
               space available.

           •   If  there  is  no  "MOUNT"  instruction,  the  prompt enables the operator manually to change the
               symbolic link to point to another backup data file, then press Return to  signal  that  the  Tape
               Coordinator can continue the operation.

       If  the  third  field  in  the  <u>tapeconfig</u>  file  names  the actual file, there is no way to recover from
       exhausting the space on the partition that houses the backup data file. It is not possible to change  the
       <u>tapeconfig</u> file in the middle of an operation.

       When  writing  to a backup data file, the Tape Coordinator writes data at 16 KB offsets. If a given block
       of data (such as the marker that signals the beginning or end of a volume) does not fill  the  entire  16
       KB, the Tape Coordinator still skips to the next offset before writing the next block. In the output of a
       <b>backup</b>  <b>dumpinfo</b>  command issued with the <b>-id</b> option, the value in the "Pos" column is the ordinal of the
       16-KB offset at which the volume data begins, and so is not generally only one higher than  the  position
       number on the previous line, as it is for dumps to tape.

   <b>The</b> <b>MOUNT</b> <b>Instruction</b>
       The "MOUNT" instruction takes a pathname as its argument, in the following format:

          MOUNT &lt;filename&gt;

       The  referenced  executable file must reside on the local disk and contain a shell script or program that
       directs an automated tape device, such as a jukebox or stacker, to mount a tape (insert it into the  tape
       reader).   The  operator  must  write  the  routine to invoke the mount command specified by the device's
       manufacturer; AFS does not include any scripts, although an example appears in "EXAMPLES".  The script or
       program inherits the Tape Coordinator's AFS authentication status.

       When the Tape Coordinator needs to mount  a  tape,  it  checks  the  configuration  file  for  a  "MOUNT"
       instruction.  If  there  is no "MOUNT" instruction, the Tape Coordinator prompts the operator to insert a
       tape before it attempts to open the tape device. If there is a "MOUNT" instruction, the Tape  Coordinator
       executes  the routine in the referenced file. The routine invoked by the "MOUNT" instruction inherits the
       local identity (UNIX UID) and AFS tokens of the <b>butc</b> command's issuer.

       There is an exception to this sequence: if the "AUTOQUERY NO" instruction appears  in  the  configuration
       file,  or  the <b>-noautoquery</b> flag was included on the <b>butc</b> command, then the Tape Coordinator assumes that
       the operator has already inserted the first tape needed for a given operation. It attempts  to  read  the
       tape  immediately,  and  only  checks  for the "MOUNT" instruction or prompts the operator if the tape is
       missing or is not the required one.

       When the Tape Coordinator invokes the routine  indicated  by  the  "MOUNT"  instruction,  it  passes  the
       following parameters to the routine in the indicated order:

       •   The tape device or backup data file's pathname, as recorded in the <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup/tapeconfig</u>
           file.

       •   The  tape operation, which (except for the exceptions noted in the following list) matches the <b>backup</b>
           command operation code used to initiate the operation:

           •   "appenddump" (when a backup dump command includes the <b>-append</b> flag).

           •   "dump" (when a backup dump command does not include the <b>-append</b> flag).

           •   "labeltape"

           •   "readlabel"

           •   "restore" (for a <b>backup</b> <b>diskrestore</b>, backup volrestore, or <b>backup</b> <b>volsetrestore</b> command).

           •   "restoredb"

           •   "savedb"

           •   "scantape"

       •   The number of times the Tape Coordinator has attempted to open the tape device or backup  data  file.
           If  the  open  attempt  returns an error, the Tape Coordinator increments this value by one and again
           invokes the "MOUNT" instruction.

       •   The tape name. For some operations, the Tape Coordinator passes the string "none",  because  it  does
           not  know  the  tape  name  (when  running  the <b>backup</b> <b>scantape</b> or <b>backup</b> <b>readlabel</b>, for example), or
           because the tape does not necessarily have a name (when running the  <b>backup</b>  <b>labeltape</b>  command,  for
           example).

       •   The  tape  ID  recorded  in  the Backup Database. As with the tape name, the Backup System passes the
           string "none" for operations where it does not know the tape ID or the tape does not necessarily have
           an ID.

       The routine invoked by the "MOUNT" instruction must return an exit code to the Tape Coordinator:

       •   Code 0 (zero) indicates that  the  routine  successfully  mounted  the  tape.  The  Tape  Coordinator
           continues  the  backup  operation.  If the routine invoked by the "MOUNT" instruction does not return
           this exit code, the Tape Coordinator never calls the "UNMOUNT" instruction.

       •   Code 1 (one) indicates that the routine failed to mount the tape. The Tape Coordinator terminates the
           operation.

       •   Any other code indicates that the routine  was  not  able  to  access  the  correct  tape.  The  Tape
           Coordinator prompts the operator to insert the correct tape.

       If  the  backup  command  was  issued in interactive mode and the operator issues the <b>backup</b> <b>kill</b> command
       while the "MOUNT" routine is running, the Tape Coordinator passes the termination signal to the  routine;
       the entire operation terminates.

   <b>The</b> <b>NAME_CHECK</b> <b>Instruction</b>
       The "NAME_CHECK" instruction takes a boolean value as its argument, in the following format:

          NAME_CHECK (YES | NO)

       When  the value is "YES" and the tape does not have a permanent name, the Tape Coordinator checks the AFS
       tape name when dumping a volume in response to the <b>backup</b>  <b>dump</b>  command.  The  AFS  tape  name  must  be
       "&lt;NULL&gt;"  or  match the tape name that the <b>backup</b> <b>dump</b> operation assigns based on the volume set and dump
       level names. This is the default behavior  if  the  "NAME_CHECK"  instruction  does  not  appear  in  the
       configuration file.

       When the value is "NO", the Tape Coordinator does not check the AFS tape name before writing to the tape.

       The Tape Coordinator always checks that all dumps on the tape are expired, and refuses to write to a tape
       that contains unexpired dumps.

   <b>The</b> <b>UNMOUNT</b> <b>Instruction</b>
       The "UNMOUNT" instruction takes a pathname as its argument, in the following format:

          UNMOUNT &lt;filename&gt;

       The  referenced  executable file must reside on the local disk and contain a shell script or program that
       directs an automated tape device, such as a jukebox or stacker, to unmount a tape  (remove  it  from  the
       tape  reader).   The  operator  must  write  the  routine  to invoke the unmount command specified by the
       device's manufacturer; AFS does not include any scripts, although an example appears in "EXAMPLES".   The
       script or program inherits the Tape Coordinator's AFS authentication status.

       After  closing  a  tape  device,  the  Tape  Coordinator  checks  the configuration file for an "UNMOUNT"
       instruction, whether or not the <b>close</b> operation succeeds. If there is no "UNMOUNT" instruction, the  Tape
       Coordinator  takes  no  action,  in  which case the operator must take the action necessary to remove the
       current tape from the drive before another can be inserted. If there is  an  "UNMOUNT"  instruction,  the
       Tape Coordinator executes the referenced file. It invokes the routine only once, passing in the following
       parameters:

       •   The tape device pathname (as specified in the <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup/tapeconfig</u> file).

       •   The tape operation (always unmount).

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>REQUIRED</b></h4><pre>
       The  file  is  protected  by UNIX mode bits. Creating the file requires the "w" (write) and "x" (execute)
       permissions on  the  <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup</u>  directory.  Editing  the  file  requires  the  "w"  (write)
       permission on the file.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  example  configuration  files demonstrate one way to structure a configuration file for a
       stacker or backup dump file. The examples are not necessarily appropriate for a specific cell;  if  using
       them as models, be sure to adapt them to the cell's needs and equipment.

   <b>Example</b> <u><b>CFG_device_name</b></u> <b>File</b> <b>for</b> <b>Stackers</b>
       In  this example, the administrator creates the following entry for a tape stacker called "stacker0.1" in
       the <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup/tapeconfig</u> file. It has port offset 0.

          2G   5K   /dev/stacker0.1   0

       The administrator includes the following five lines in the  <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup/CFG_stacker0.1</u>  file.
       To review the meaning of each instruction, see "DESCRIPTION".

          MOUNT /var/lib/openafs/backup/stacker0.1
          UNMOUNT /var/lib/openafs/backup/stacker0.1
          AUTOQUERY NO
          ASK NO
          NAME_CHECK NO

       Finally,     the     administrator     writes     the     following    executable    routine    in    the
       <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup/stacker0.1</u> file referenced by the  "MOUNT"  and  "UNMOUNT"  instructions  in  the
       <u>CFG_stacker0.1</u> file.

          #! /bin/csh -f

          set devicefile = $1
          set operation = $2
          set tries = $3
          set tapename = $4
          set tapeid = $5

          set exit_continue = 0
          set exit_abort = 1
          set exit_interactive = 2

          #--------------------------------------------

          if (${tries} &gt; 1) then
             echo "Too many tries"
             exit ${exit_interactive}
          endif

          if (${operation} == "unmount") then
             echo "UnMount: Will leave tape in drive"
             exit ${exit_continue}
          endif

          if ((${operation} == "dump")     |\
              (${operation} == "appenddump")     |\
              (${operation} == "savedb"))  then

              stackerCmd_NextTape ${devicefile}
              if (${status} != 0)exit${exit_interactive}
              echo "Will continue"
              exit ${exit_continue}
          endif

          if ((${operation} == "labeltape")    |\
              (${operation} == "readlabel")) then
             echo "Will continue"
             exit ${exit_continue}
          endif

          echo "Prompt for tape"
          exit ${exit_interactive}

       This  routine  uses  two of the parameters passed to it by the Backup System: "tries" and "operation". It
       follows the recommended practice of prompting for a tape if the value of the  "tries"  parameter  exceeds
       one, because that implies that the stacker is out of tapes.

       For  a  <b>backup</b>  <b>dump</b>  or  backup  savedb  operation,  the routine calls the example "stackerCmd_NextTape"
       function provided by the stacker's manufacturer. Note that the final lines in the file  return  the  exit
       code  that  prompts the operator to insert a tape; these lines are invoked when either the stacker cannot
       load a tape or a the operation being performed is not one of those explicitly mentioned in the file (such
       as a restore operation).

   <b>Example</b> <u><b>CFG_device_name</b></u> <b>File</b> <b>for</b> <b>Dumping</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Data</b> <b>File</b>
       In this example, the administrator creates the following entry for a backup data file  called  <u>HSM_device</u>
       in the <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup/tapeconfig</u> file. It has port offset 20.

          1G   0K   /dev/HSM_device   20

       The  administrator  includes  the  following lines in the <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup/CFG_HSM_device</u> file. To
       review the meaning of each instruction, see "DESCRIPTION".

          MOUNT /var/lib/openafs/backup/file
          FILE YES
          ASK NO

       Finally, the administrator writes the following executable routine  in  the  <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup/file</u>
       file  referenced  by  the  "MOUNT"  instruction  in  the  <u>CFG_HSM_device</u>  file,  to  control how the Tape
       Coordinator handles the file.

          #! /bin/csh -f
          set devicefile = $1
          set operation = $2
          set tries = $3
          set tapename = $4
          set tapeid = $5

          set exit_continue = 0
          set exit_abort = 1
          set exit_interactive = 2

          #--------------------------------------------

          if (${tries} &gt; 1) then
             echo "Too many tries"
             exit ${exit_interactive}
          endif

          if (${operation} == "labeltape") then
             echo "Won't label a tape/file"
             exit ${exit_abort}
          endif

          if ((${operation} == "dump")   |\
              (${operation} == "appenddump")   |\
              (${operation} == "restore")   |\
              (${operation} == "savedb")    |\
              (${operation} == "restoredb")) then

             <a href="file:/bin/rm">/bin/rm</a> -f ${devicefile}
             <a href="file:/bin/ln">/bin/ln</a> -s /hsm/${tapename}_${tapeid} ${devicefile}
             if (${status} != 0) exit ${exit_abort}
          endif

          exit ${exit_continue}

       Like the example routine for a tape stacker, this routine uses the  "tries"  and  "operation"  parameters
       passed  to  it by the Backup System. The "tries" parameter tracks how many times the Tape Coordinator has
       attempted to access the file. A value greater than one indicates that the Tape Coordinator cannot  access
       it,  and the routine returns exit code 2 ("exit_interactive"), which results in a prompt for the operator
       to load a tape. The operator can use this opportunity  to  change  the  name  of  the  backup  data  file
       specified in the <b>tapeconfig</b> file.

       The  primary  function  of this routine is to establish a link between the device file and the file to be
       dumped or restored. When the Tape Coordinator is executing a <b>backup</b> <b>dump</b>, <b>backup</b> <b>restore</b>, <b>backup</b>  <b>savedb</b>,
       or  <b>backup</b>  <b>restoredb</b>  operation,  the routine invokes the UNIX "ln -s" command to create a symbolic link
       from the backup data file named in the <u>tapeconfig</u> file to the actual file to use (this is the recommended
       method). It uses the value of the "tapename" and "tapeid" parameters to construct the file name.
