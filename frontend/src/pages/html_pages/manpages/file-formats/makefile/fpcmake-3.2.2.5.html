</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Makefile.fpc - Configuration file for fpcmake.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Makefile.fpc</u>  is  a  configuration  file  for  the fpcmake command. Starting from this file a <u>Makefile</u> is
       created to compile Free Pascal units and programs.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Makefile.fpc</b> is a plain ASCII file that contains a number of sections as  in  a  Windows  <u>ini</u>  file.  The
       following sections are recognized (in alphabetical order):

       <b>clean</b>  Specifies  rules  for  cleaning  the  directory  of units and programs.  The following entries are
              recognized:

              <u>units</u>  names of all units that should be removed when  cleaning.  Don't  specify  extensions,  the
                     makefile will append these by itself.

              <u>files</u>  names of files that should be removed. Specify full filenames.

       <b>defaults</b>
              The defaults section contains some default settings. The following keywords are recognized:

       <b>dirs</b>

       <b>info</b>

       <b>install</b>
              Contains  instructions  for  installation  of  your  units and programs. The following keywods are
              recognized:

              <u>dirprefix</u>
                     the directory below wchich all installs are done. This corresponds to the <u>--prefix</u> argument
                     to GNU <u>configure</u> It is used for the installation of programs and units. By default, this is
                     <b><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b> on linux, and <b>/pp</b> on all other platforms.

              <u>dirbase</u>
                     The directory that is used as the base directory for the  installation  of  units.  Default
                     this  is  <u>dirprefix</u> appended with <u>/lib/fpc/FPC_VERSION</u> for linux or simply the dirprefix on
                     other platforms.
       Units will be installed in the subdirectory <u>units/$(OS_TARGET)</u> of the <u>dirbase</u> entry.

       <b>libs</b>   This section specifies what units should be merged into a library, and what external libraries are
              needed. It can contain the following keywords:

              <u>libname</u>
                     the name of the library that should be created.

              <u>libunits</u>
                     a comma-separated list of units that should be moved into one library.

              <u>needgcclib</u>
                     a boolean value that specifies whether the gcc library is needed. This will make sure  that
                     the path to the GCC library is inserted in the library search path.

              <u>needotherlib</u>
                     a boolean value that tells the makefile that other library directories will be needed.

       <b>packages</b>
              Which packages must be used. This section can contain the following keywords:

              <u>packages</u>
                     A  comma-separated  list of packages that are needed to compile the targets.  Valid for all
                     platforms. In order to  differentiate  between  platforms,  you  can  prepend  the  keyword
                     <u>packages</u> with the OS you are compiling for, e.g.  <u>linuxpackages</u> if you want the makefile to
                     use the listed packages on linux only.

              <u>fcl</u>    This is a boolean value (0 or 1) that indicates whether the FCL is used.

              <u>rtl</u>    This is a boolean value (0 or 1) that indicates whether the RTL should be recompiled.

       <b>postsettings</b>
              Anything  that  is in this section will be inserted as-is in the makefile <u>after</u> the makefile rules
              that are generated by fpcmake, but <u>before</u> the general configuration rules.  In it, you cannot  use
              variables that are defined by fpcmake rules, but you can define additional rules and configuration
              variables.

       <b>presettings</b>
              Anything that is in this section will be inserted as-is in the makefile <u>before</u> the makefile target
              rules  that  are  generated  by  fpcmake.  This  means  that you cannot use any variables that are
              normally defined by

       <b>rules</b>  In this section you can insert dependency rules and any other targets you wish  to  have.  Do  not
              insert 'default rules' here.

       <b>sections</b>
              Here  you  can  specify  which  'rule  sections' should be included in the Makefile.  The sections
              consist of a series of boolean keywords; each keyword decides whether a particular section will be
              written to the makefile. By default, all sections are written.

              You can have the following boolean keywords in this section.

              <u>none</u>   If this is set to true, then no sections are written.

              <u>loaders</u>
                     A  space  separated list of names of assembler files that must be assembled.  Don't specify

              <u>programs</u>
                     A space separated list of program names that  need  to  be  compiled.  Do  not  specify  an

              <u>rst</u>    a  list  of  <u>rst</u> files that needs to be converted to <u>.po</u> files for use with GNU <b>gettext</b> and
                     internationalization routines.

              <u>units</u>  A space separated list of unit names that need to be compiled. Do not specify an extension,
                     just the name of the unit as it would appear un a <u>uses</u> clause is sufficient.

       <b>tools</b>  In this section you can specify which tools are needed. Definitions to  use  each  of  the  listed
              tools will be inserted in the makefile, depending on the setting in this section.

              Each keyword is a boolean keyword; you can switch the use of a tool on or off with it.

              The following keywords are recognised:

              <u>toolppdep</u>
                     Use <b>ppdep</b> the dependency tool.  <u>True</u> by default.

       <b>zip</b>    This  section  can  be used to make zip files from the compiled units and programs. By default all
              compiled units  are  zipped.  The  zip  behaviour  can  be  influencd  with  the  presettings  and
              postsettings sections.

              The following keywords can be used in this unit:

              <u>zipname</u>
                     this file is the name of the zip file that will be produced.

              <u>ziptarget</u>
                     is  the  name of a makefile target that will be executed before the zip is made. By default
