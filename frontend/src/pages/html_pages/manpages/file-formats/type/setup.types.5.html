</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       setup.types - epm gui setup types file format.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  EPM  <b>setup</b>  program normally presents the user with a list of software products to install, which is
       called a "custom" software installation.

       If a file called <u>setup.types</u> is present in the package directory, the user will instead be presented with
       a list of installation types. Each type has an associated product list which determines the products that
       are installed by default. If a type has no products associated with it, then it is treated  as  a  custom
       installation and the user is presented with a list of packages to choose from.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>setup.types</u> file is an ASCII text file consisting of type and product lines. Comments can be inserted
       by starting a line with the pound sign (#). Each installation type is defined by a line starting with the
       word TYPE. Products are defined by a line starting with the word INSTALL:

     TYPE Typical End-User Configuration
     INSTALL foo
     INSTALL foo-help
     TYPE Typical Developer Configuration
     INSTALL foo
     INSTALL foo-help
     INSTALL foo-devel
     INSTALL foo-examples
     TYPE Custom Configuration

       In the example above, three installation types are defined. Since the last type includes no products, the
       user will be presented with the full list of products to choose from.
