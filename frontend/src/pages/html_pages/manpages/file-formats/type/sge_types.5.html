</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sge_types - Grid Engine type descriptions

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Grid  Engine  user  interface consists of several programs and files. Some command-line switches and
       several file attributes are types. The syntax for these types is explained in this page.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       These types are used for defining Grid Engine configuration:

   <b>object_name</b>
       An object name is a sequence of up to 512 ASCII printing characters except SPACE,  "/",  ":",  "´",  "\",
       "[", "]", "{", "}", "|", "(", ")", "@", "%", "," or the '"' character itself.

   <b>calendar_name</b>
       A calendar name is the name of a Grid Engine calendar described in <u><a href="../man5/calendar_conf.5.html">calendar_conf</a></u>(5).
       <u>calendar_name</u> := <u>object_name</u>

   <b>ckpt_name</b>
       A "ckpt_name" is the name of a Grid Engine checkpointing interface described in <u><a href="../man5/checkpoint.5.html">checkpoint</a></u>(5).
       <u>ckpt_name</u> := <u>object_name</u>

   <b>complex_name</b>
       A complex name is the name of a Grid Engine resource attribute described in <u><a href="../man5/complex.5.html">complex</a></u>(5).
       <u>complex_name</u> := <u>object_name</u>

   <b>host_identifier</b>
       A host identifier can be either a host name or a host group name.
       <u>host_identifier</u> := <u>host_name</u> | <u>hostgroup_name</u>

   <b>hostgroup_name</b>
       A host group name is the name of a Grid Engine host group described in <u><a href="../man5/hostgroup.5.html">hostgroup</a></u>(5).  Note, to allow host
       group names to be distinguished easily from host names, a "@" prefix is used.
       <u>hostgroup_name</u> := @<u>object_name</u>

   <b>host_name</b>
       A  host  name  is  the  official  name  of  a  host  node. Host names with a domain specification such as
       "gridmaster.sun.com" are called fully-qualified host names, whereas  host  names  like  "gridmaster"  are
       called  short  host  names.  Note  that  the  install time parameters <b>default_domain</b> and <b>ignore_fqdn</b> (see
       <u><a href="../man5/bootstrap.5.html">bootstrap</a></u>(5)) affect how Grid Engine deals with host names in general.

       The      following      host       names       are       generally       invalid       or       reserved:
       <b>global</b>, <b>template</b>, <b>all</b>, <b>default</b>, <b>unknown</b>, <b>none</b>.   However,  it  may  sometimes be useful to define a dummy
       host name of <b>global</b> for convenient use of <u><a href="../man1/qhost.1.html">qhost</a></u>(1).

   <b>jsv_url</b>
       The <b>jsv_url</b> has following format:

       <u>jsv_url</u> := <u>jsv_client_url</u> | <u>jsv_server_url</u>

       <u>jsv_server_url</u> := [ <u>type</u> '<b>:</b>' ] [ <u>user</u> '<b>@</b>' ] <u>path</u>

       <u>jsv_client_url</u> := [ <u>type</u> '<b>:</b>' ] <u>path</u>

       <u>type</u> := '<b>script</b>'

       At the moment only the <u>type</u> <b>script</b> is allowed. This means that <u>path</u> is either the path to a script or  to
       a  binary  application  which will be used to instantiate a JSV process. The <u>type</u> is optional until other
       <u>types</u> are supported by Grid Engine.

       Specifying a <u>user</u> is only allowed for server JSVs. Client JSVs  will  automatically  be  started  as  the
       submit user, and server JSVs as the admin user if not otherwise specified.

       The <u>path</u> has always to be the absolute path to a binary or application.

   <b>memory_specifier</b>
       Memory specifiers are positive decimal, hexadecimal or octal integer constants which may be followed by a
       multiplier  letter.  Valid  multiplier letters are <b>k</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>g</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>t</b>, and <b>T</b>, where <b>k</b> means multiply the
       value by 1000, <b>K</b> multiply by 1024, <b>m</b> multiply by 1000×1000,  <b>M</b>  multiply  by  1024×1024,  <b>g</b>  multiply  by
       1000×1000×1000,  <b>G</b>  multiply  by  1024×1024×1024,  <b>t</b>  multiply  by 1000×1000×1000×1000, and <b>T</b> multiply by
       1024×1024×1024×1024.  If no multiplier is present, the value is just counted in  bytes.   Whether  memory
       values  above  the  32-bit  limit  are  representable  on 32-bit systems, even for disk space, is system-
       dependent.

   <b>pe_name</b>
       A PE name is the name of a Grid Engine parallel environment described in <u><a href="../man5/sge_pe.5.html">sge_pe</a></u>(5).
       <u>pe_name</u> := <u>object_name</u>

   <b>project_name</b>
       A project name is the name of a Grid Engine project described in <u><a href="../man5/project.5.html">project</a></u>(5).
       <u>project_name</u> := <u>object_name</u>

   <b>queue_name</b>
       A queue name is the name of a Grid Engine queue described in <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5).
       <u>queue_name</u>  := <u>object_name</u>

   <b>time_specifier</b>
       A time specifier either consists of a positive decimal, hexadecimal or octal integer constant,  in  which
       case  the  value is interpreted to be in seconds, or is built from 3 decimal integer numbers separated by
       colon signs, where the first number counts the hours, the second the minutes and the third  the  seconds.
       If  a  number  would  be  zero it can be left out but the separating colon must remain (e.g. <b>1:0:1</b> = <b>1::1</b>
       means 1 hour and 1 second).

   <b>user_name</b>
       A user name can be the name of a <u><a href="../man1/login.1.html">login</a></u>(1) user or of the Grid Engine user object described in <u><a href="../man5/user.5.html">user</a></u>(5).
       <u>user_name</u> := <u>object_name</u>

   <b>userset_name</b>
       A user set name is the name of a Grid Engine access list or department described in <u><a href="../man5/access_list.5.html">access_list</a></u>(5).
       <u>userset_name</u> := <u>object_name</u>

   <b>date_time</b>
       A <u>date_time</u> value must conform to [[<u>CC</u>]<u>YY</u>]<u>MMDDhhmm</u>[<b>.</b><u>SS</u>], where:

              <u>CC</u>        denotes the century in 2 digits.
              <u>YY</u>        denotes the year in 2 digits.
              <u>MM</u>        denotes the month in 2 digits.
              <u>DD</u>        denotes the day in 2 digits.
              <u>hh</u>        denotes the hour in 2 digits.
              <u>mm</u>        denotes the minute in 2 digits.
              <u>ss</u>        denotes the seconds in 2 digits (default 00).

              If any of the optional date fields are omitted, the corresponding value of  the  current  date  is
              assumed. If <u>CC</u> is not specified, a <u>YY</u> of &lt;70 means 20<u>YY</u>.
              Use of this option may cause unexpected results if the clocks of the hosts in the Grid Engine pool
              are out of sync. Also, the proper behavior of this option very much depends on the correct setting
              of  the  appropriate timezone, e.g. in the TZ environment variable (see <u><a href="../man1/date.1.html">date</a></u>(1) for details), when
              the Grid Engine daemons <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8) and <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) are invoked.

   <b>time</b>
       A <u>time</u> value must conform to <u>hh</u><b>:</b><u>mm</u><b>:</b><u>ss</u>, or <u>seconds</u> where:

              <u>hh</u>        denotes the hour in 2 digits.
              <u>mm</u>        denotes the minute in 2 digits.
              <u>ss</u>        denotes the seconds in 2 digits (default 00).
              <u>seconds</u>   is a number of seconds (used for duration values)

   <b>name</b>
       A <u>name</u> is an arbitrary string of ASCII printing characters, but may not contain  "/", ":", "@", "\", "*",
       or "?".

   <b>account_name</b>
       Identifies the account to which the resource consumption of a job should be charged.
       <u>account_name</u> := <u>name</u>

   <b>job_name</b>
       A job name is a <u>name</u> as above, with the restriction that it cannot start with a digit (to avoid ambiguity
       with a job number in some contexts).

   <b>ar_name</b>
       An advance reservation name is a <u>name</u> as above, with the restriction that it cannot start  with  a  digit
       (to avoid ambiguity with an AR number in some contexts).

</pre><h4><b>MATCHING</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       These types are used for matching Grid Engine configuration:

   <b>expression</b>
       A  wildcard  expression  is  a regular boolean expression that consists of one or more <u>pattern</u>s joined by
       boolean operators.  When a wildcard expression is used, the following definition applies:

       expression= ["!"] ["("] valExp [")"] [ AND_OR expression ]*
       valExp  = pattern | expression
       AND_OR  = "&amp;" | "|"
       where:

       "!"       not operator: negate the following pattern or expression
       "&amp;"       and operator: logically and with the following expression
       "|"       or operator: logically or with the following expression
       "("       open bracket: begin an inner expression.
       ")"       close bracket: end an inner expression.
       "pattern" see the <b>pattern</b> definition that follows

       If typed at a shell, the expression itself should be quoted to ensure that it  is  not  expanded  by  the
       shell.

       e.g.
              "(lx*|sol*)&amp;*64*" any string beginning with either "lx" or
                                "sol" and containing "64"
              "rh_3*&amp;!rh_3.1"   any string beginning with "rh_3", except
                                "rh_3.1"

   <b>pattern</b>
       When patterns are used the following definitions apply:

       "*"     matches any character and any number of characters
               (between 0 and infinity).
       "?"     matches any single character.
       "."     is the character ".". It has no other meaning.
       "\"     escape character, making the following character match literally;
                "\\" matches "\", "\*" matches "*", "\?" matches "?".
       "[...]" specifies an array or a range of allowed
               characters for one character at a specific position.
               Character ranges may be specified using the a-z notation.
               The caret symbol (<b>^</b>) is <u>not</u> interpreted as a logical
               not; it is interpreted literally.

       For more details please see <u><a href="../man5/fnmatch.5.html">fnmatch</a></u>(5), <u><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></u>(7).

       A pattern on a shell command line should normally be quoted to avoid it being interpreted by the shell as
       a file match.

   <b>range</b>
       The task range specifier has the form

       <u>n</u>[<b>-</b><u>m</u>[<b>:</b><u>s</u>]][<b>,</b><u>n</u>[<b>-</b><u>m</u>[<b>:</b><u>s</u>]]<b>,</b>...]  or <u>n</u>[<b>-</b><u>m</u>[<b>:</b><u>s</u>]][ <u>n</u>[<b>-</b><u>m</u>[<b>:</b><u>s</u>]] ...]

       and  thus  consists  of  a  comma- or blank-separated list of range specifiers <u>n</u>[<b>-</b><u>m</u>[<b>:</b><u>s</u>]].  The ranges are
       concatenated to the complete task id range. Each range may be a single number, a simple range of the form
       <u>n</u><b>-</b><u>m</u>, or a range with a step size.

   <b>wc_ar</b>
       The wildcard advance reservation (AR) specification is a placeholder for AR ids and AR names including AR
       name patterns. An AR id always references one AR, while the name and  pattern  might  reference  multiple
       ARs.

       <u>wc_ar</u> := <u>ar_id</u> | <u>ar_name</u> | <u>pattern</u>

   <b>wc_ar_list</b>
       The  wildcard  advance  reservation  (AR)  list  specification  allows  referencing multiple ARs with one
       command.

       <u>wc_ar_list</u> := <u>wc_ar</u>[<b>,</b> <u>wc_ar</u> <b>,</b> ...]

   <b>wc_host</b>
       A wildcard host specification (<u>wc_host</u>) is a wildcard expression which might match one or more hosts used
       in the cluster.  The first character of that string never begins with an at-character ('@'), even if  the
       expression begins with a wildcard character.

       e.g.
              *            all hosts
              a*           all host beginning with an 'a'

   <b>wc_hostgroup</b>
       A  wildcard hostgroup specification (<u>wc_hostgroup</u>) is a wildcard expression which might match one or more
       hostgroups.  The first character of that string is always an at-character ('@').

       More information concerning hostgroups can be found in <u><a href="../man5/hostgroup.5.html">hostgroup</a></u>(5)

       e.g.
              @*           all hostgroups in the cluster
              @solaris     the @solaris hostgroup

   <b>wc_job</b>
       The wildcard job specification is a placeholder for job ids, and job names including job name patterns. A
       job id always references one job, while the name and pattern might reference multiple jobs.

       <u>wc_job</u> := <u>job-id</u> | <u>job_name</u> | <u>pattern</u>

   <b>wc_job_range</b>
       The wildcard job range specification allows referencing specific array tasks for one  or  multiple  jobs.
       The job is referenced via <u>wc_job</u> and in addition gets a range specifier for the array tasks.

       <u>wc_job_range</u> := <u>wc_job</u> [<b>-t</b> <u>range</u>]

       If present, the <u>task_range</u> restricts the effect of the <u>qalter</u> etc.  operation to the array job task range
       specified as a suffix to the job id.  (See the <b>-t</b> option to <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1) for further details on array jobs.)

   <b>wc_job_list</b>
       The wildcard job list specification allows referencing multiple jobs with one command.

       <u>wc_job_list</u> := <u>wc_job</u>[<b>,</b> <u>wc_job</u>, ...]

   <b>wc_job_range_list</b>
       The  wildcard job range list (<u>wc_job_range_list</u>) allows referencing multiple job ranges with one command.
       one of the following forms:

       <u>wc_job_range_list</u> := <u>wc_job_range</u>[<b>,</b><u>wc_job_range</u>...]

   <b>wc_qdomain</b>
       <u>wc_qdomain</u> := <u>wc_cqueue</u> "@" <u>wc_hostgroup</u>

       A wildcard expression queue domain specification (<u>wc_qdomain</u>) starts with a wildcard  expression  cluster
       queue  name (<u>wc_cqueue</u>) followed by an at-character '@' and a wildcard expression hostgroup specification
       (<u>wc_hostgroup</u>).

       A <u>wc_qdomain</u> is used to address a group of queue instances.  All queue instances residing on a host which
       is part of matching hostgroups will be addressed. Please note, that <u>wc_hostgroup</u> always  begins  with  an
       at-character.

       e.g.
              *@@*         all queue instances whose underlying
                           host is part of at least one hostgroup
              a*@@e*       all queue instances beginning with a whose underlying
                           host is part of at least one hostgroup beginning with e
              *@@solaris   all queue instances on hosts in
                           the @solaris hostgroup

   <b>wc_cqueue</b>
       A  wildcard expression cluster queue specification (<u>wc_cqueue</u>) is a wildcard expression which might match
       one or more cluster queues used in the cluster.  That string never contains an at-character  ('@'),  even
       if the expression begins with a wildcard character.

       e.g.
              *            all cluster queues
              a*           all cluster queues beginning with an 'a'
              a*&amp;!adam     all cluster queues beginning with an 'a', but not adam

   <b>wc_qinstance</b>
       <u>wc_qinstance</u> := <u>wc_cqueue</u> "@" <u>wc_host</u>

       A  wildcard  expression  queue  instance  specification  (<u>wc_qinstance</u>) starts with a wildcard expression
       cluster queue name (<u>wc_cqueue</u>) followed by  an  at-character  '@'  and  a  wildcard  expression  hostname
       (<u>wc_host</u>).

       <u>wc_qinstance</u> expressions are used to address a group of queue instances whose underlying hostname matches
       the  given  expression.   Please  note that the first character of <u>wc_host</u> never matches the at-character
       '@'.

       e.g.
              *@*          all queue instances in the cluster
              *@b*         all queue instances whose
                           hostname begins with a 'b'
              *@b*|c*      all queue instances whose
                           hostname begins with a 'b' or 'c'

   <b>wc_queue</b>
       <u>wc_queue</u> := <u>wc_cqueue</u> | <u>wc_qdomain</u> | <u>wc_qinstance</u>

       A wildcard queue expression (<u>wc_queue</u>) might either be a wildcard expression, cluster queue specification
       (<u>wc_cqueue</u>), a wildcard expression queue domain specification  (<u>wc_qdomain</u>),  or  a  wildcard  expression
       queue instance specification (<u>wc_qinstance</u>).

       e.g.
              big_*1           cluster queues which begin with
                               "big_" and end with "1"
              big_*&amp;!*1        cluster queues which begin with
                               "big_", but do not end with "1"
              *@fangorn        all qinstances residing on host
                               fangorn

   <b>wc_queue_list</b>
       <u>wc_queue_list</u> := <u>wc_queue</u> ["," <u>wc_queue</u> "," ...]

       Comma-separated list of <u>wc_queue</u> elements.

       e.g.
              big, medium_*@@sol*, *@fangorn.sun.com

   <b>wc_user</b>
       A wildcard user name pattern is either a wildcard user name specification or a full user name.

       <u>wc_user</u> := <u>user_name</u> | <u>pattern</u>

   <b>wc_user_list</b>
       A list of user names.

       <u>wc_user_list</u> := <u>wc_user</u>[<b>,</b><u>wc_user</u><b>,</b>...]

   <b>wc_project</b>
       A wildcard project name pattern is either a wildcard project name specification or a full project name.

       <u>wc_project</u> := <u>project</u> <b>|</b> <u>pattern</u>

   <b>wc_pe_name</b>
       A  wildcard  parallel  environment  name  pattern is either a wildcard PE name specification or a full PE
       name.

       <u>wc_pe_name</u> := <u>pe_name</u> | <u>pattern</u>

   <b>parallel_env</b>
       The <b>parallel_env</b> specification has the format

       <u>wc_pe_name</u> <u>n</u>[<b>-</b>[<u>m</u>]]|[<b>-</b>]<u>m</u>,...

       specifying a parallel programming environment (PE) to select for a submitted job  or  an  AR.  The  range
       descriptor  following  the  wildcard  PE name specifies the number of slots to allocate, which is usually
       equivalent to the total number of parallel processes to be run (for simple distributed  memory  jobs)  or
       the  number  of  threads  (for  shared  memory  or mixed distributed/threaded jobs), as implied by the PE
       definition. Grid Engine will allocate  the  appropriate  resources,  as  available.   <u><a href="../man5/sge_pe.5.html">sge_pe</a></u>(5)  contains
       information about the definition of PEs.

       You  can  specify  a  PE  name  which  uses  wildcards.   Thus the request "mpi*" will match any parallel
       environment with a name starting with the string "mpi". In the case  of  multiple  parallel  environments
       whose  names match a name string, when it is required to select one the one with the most available slots
       is chosen.

       The range specification is a list of range expressions of the form "<u>n</u><b>-</b><u>m</u>", where <u>n</u>  and  <u>m</u>  are  positive,
       non-zero integers.  The form "<u>n</u>" is equivalent to "<u>n</u><b>-</b><u>n</u>".  The form "<b>-</b><u>m</u>" is equivalent to "<b>1-</b><u>m</u>".  The form
       "<u>n</u><b>-</b>"  is equivalent to "<u>n</u><b>-</b>infinity".  The range specification is processed as follows: The largest number
       of queues requested is checked  first.  If  enough  queues  meeting  the  specified  attribute  list  are
