</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pulse-daemon.conf - PulseAudio daemon configuration file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.config/pulse/daemon.conf">~/.config/pulse/daemon.conf</a></u>

       <u><a href="file:~/.config/pulse/daemon.conf.d/">~/.config/pulse/daemon.conf.d/</a>*.conf</u>

       <u>/etc/pulse/daemon.conf</u>

       <u>/etc/pulse/daemon.conf.d/*.conf</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  PulseAudio  sound server reads configuration directives from a configuration file on startup. If the
       per-user file <u><a href="file:~/.config/pulse/daemon.conf">~/.config/pulse/daemon.conf</a></u> exists, it is used, otherwise  the  system  configuration  file
       <u>/etc/pulse/daemon.conf</u> is used. In addition to those main files, configuration directives can also be put
       in files under directories <u><a href="file:~/.config/pulse/daemon.conf.d/">~/.config/pulse/daemon.conf.d/</a></u> and <u>/etc/pulse/daemon.conf.d/</u>. Those files have
       to have the .conf file name extension, but otherwise the file names can be chosen freely. The files under
       daemon.conf.d  are processed in alphabetical order. In case the same option is set in multiple files, the
       last file to set an option overrides earlier files. The main daemon.conf  file  is  processed  first,  so
       options set in files under daemon.conf.d override the main file.

       Please note that the server also reads a configuration script on startup. See <b><a href="../man5/default.pa.5.html">default.pa</a>(5)</b>.

       The  configuration file is a simple collection of variable declarations. If the configuration file parser
       encounters either ; or # it ignores the rest of the line until its end.

       For the settings that take a boolean argument the values <b>true</b>, <b>yes</b>, <b>on</b> and <b>1</b> are equivalent, resp. <b>false</b>,
       <b>no</b>, <b>off</b>, <b>0</b>.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>daemonize=</b> Daemonize after startup. Takes a boolean value, defaults to <b>no</b>. The <b>--daemonize</b> command line
       option takes precedence.

       <b>fail=</b> Fail to start up if any of the directives in the configuration script <u>default.pa</u> fail. Takes a
       boolean argument, defaults to <b>yes</b>. The <b>--fail</b> command line option takes precedence.

       <b>allow-module-loading=</b> Allow/disallow module loading after startup. This is a security feature that if
       disabled makes sure that no further modules may be loaded into the PulseAudio server after startup
       completed. It is recommended to disable this when <b>system-instance</b> is enabled. Please note that certain
       features like automatic hot-plug support will not work if this option is enabled. Takes a boolean
       argument, defaults to <b>yes</b>. The <b>--disallow-module-loading</b> command line option takes precedence.

       <b>allow-exit=</b> Allow/disallow exit on user request. Defaults to <b>yes</b>.

       <b>resample-method=</b> The resampling algorithm to use. Use one of <b>src-sinc-best-quality</b>, <b>src-sinc-medium-</b>
       <b>quality</b>, <b>src-sinc-fastest</b>, <b>src-zero-order-hold</b>, <b>src-linear</b>, <b>trivial</b>, <b>speex-float-N</b>, <b>speex-fixed-N</b>,
       <b>ffmpeg</b>, <b>soxr-mq</b>, <b>soxr-hq</b>, <b>soxr-vhq</b>. See the documentation of libsamplerate and speex for explanations of
       the different src- and speex- methods, respectively. The method <b>trivial</b> is the most basic algorithm
       implemented. If you're tight on CPU consider using this. On the other hand it has the worst quality of
       them all. The Speex resamplers take an integer quality setting in the range 0..10 (bad...good). They
       exist in two flavours: <b>fixed</b> and <b>float</b>. The former uses fixed point numbers, the latter relies on
       floating point numbers. On most desktop CPUs the float point resampler is a lot faster, and it also
       offers slightly better quality. The soxr-family methods are based on libsoxr, a resampler library from
       the SoX sound processing utility. The mq variant has the best performance of the three. The hq is more
       expensive and, according to SoX developers, is considered the best choice for audio of up to 16 bits per
       sample. The vhq variant has more precision than hq and is more suitable for larger samples. The Soxr
       resamplers generally offer better quality at less CPU compared to other resamplers, such as speex. The
       downside is that they can add a significant delay to the output (usually up to around 20 ms, in rare
       cases more). See the output of <b>dump-resample-methods</b> for a complete list of all available resamplers.
       Defaults to <b>speex-float-1</b>. The <b>--resample-method</b> command line option takes precedence. Note that some
       modules overwrite or allow overwriting of the resampler to use.

       <b>avoid-resampling=</b> If set, try to configure the device to avoid resampling. This only works on devices
       which support reconfiguring their rate, and when no other streams are already playing or capturing audio.
       The device will also not be configured to a rate less than the default and alternate sample rates.

       <b>enable-remixing=</b> If disabled never upmix or downmix channels to different channel maps. Instead, do a
       simple name-based matching only. Defaults to <b>yes</b>. There is no known valid use case for setting this
       option to <b>no</b>, therefore, this option is deprecated and may be removed in a future version of PulseAudio.

       <b>remixing-use-all-sink-channels=</b> If enabled, use all sink channels when remixing. Otherwise, remix to the
       minimal set of sink channels needed to reproduce all of the source channels. (This has no effect on LFE
       remixing.) Defaults to <b>yes</b>.

       <b>enable-lfe-remixing=</b> This is a way to set <b>remixing-produce-lfe</b> and <b>remixing-consume-lfe</b> to the same value
       at once. This option only exists for backward compatibility and may be removed in a future version of
       PulseAudio.

       <b>remixing-produce-lfe=</b> If enabled, and the sink input does not have the LFE channel, synthesize the output
       LFE channel as a (lowpass-filtered, if <b>lfe-crossover-freq</b> is not 0) average of all input channels. Also,
       when <b>lfe-crossover-freq</b> is not 0, filter out low frequencies from other channels while producing a
       synthetic LFE output. If disabled, the output LFE channel will only get a signal when an input LFE
       channel is available as well. Defaults to <b>no</b>.

       <b>remixing-consume-lfe=</b> If enabled, and the sink does not have an LFE channel, redirect the input LFE
       channel (if any) to other channels. If disabled, the input LFE channel will remain unused unless the sink
       has the LFE channel as well. Defaults to <b>no</b>.

       <b>lfe-crossover-freq=</b> The crossover frequency (in Hz) for the LFE filter. Set it to 0 to disable the LFE
       filter. Defaults to 0.

       <b>use-pid-file=</b> Create a PID file in the runtime directory (<u>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/pulse/pid</u>). If this is enabled
       you may use commands like <b>--kill</b> or <b>--check</b>. If you are planning to start more than one PulseAudio
       process per user, you better disable this option since it effectively disables multiple instances. Takes
       a boolean argument, defaults to <b>yes</b>. The <b>--use-pid-file</b> command line option takes precedence.

       <b>cpu-limit=</b> If disabled do not install the CPU load limiter, even on platforms where it is supported. This
       option is useful when debugging/profiling PulseAudio to disable disturbing SIGXCPU signals. Takes a
       boolean argument, defaults to <b>no</b>. The <b>--no-cpu-limit</b> command line argument takes precedence.

       <b>system-instance=</b> Run the daemon as system-wide instance, requires root privileges. Takes a boolean
       argument, defaults to <b>no</b>. The <b>--system</b> command line argument takes precedence.

       <b>local-server-type=</b> Please don't use this option if you don't have to! This option is currently only
       useful when you want D-Bus clients to use a remote server. This option may be removed in future versions.
       If you only want to run PulseAudio in the system mode, use the <b>system-instance</b> option. This option takes
       one of <b>user</b>, <b>system</b> or <b>none</b> as the argument. This is essentially a duplicate for the <b>system-instance</b>
       option. The difference is the <b>none</b> option, which is useful when you want to use a remote server with D-
       Bus clients. If both this and <b>system-instance</b> are defined, this option takes precedence. Defaults to
       whatever the <b>system-instance</b> is set.

       <b>enable-shm=</b> Enable data transfer via POSIX or memfd shared memory. Takes a boolean argument, defaults to
       <b>yes</b>. The <b>--disable-shm</b> command line argument takes precedence.

       <b>enable-memfd=</b>. Enable memfd shared memory. Takes a boolean argument, defaults to <b>yes</b>.

       <b>shm-size-bytes=</b> Sets the shared memory segment size for the daemon, in bytes. If left unspecified or is
       set to 0 it will default to some system-specific default, usually 64 MiB. Please note that usually there
       is no need to change this value, unless you are running an OS kernel that does not do memory overcommit.

       <b>lock-memory=</b> Locks the entire PulseAudio process into memory. While this might increase drop-out safety
       when used in conjunction with real-time scheduling this takes away a lot of memory from other processes
       and might hence considerably slow down your system. Defaults to <b>no</b>.

       <b>flat-volumes=</b> Enable 'flat' volumes, i.e. where possible let the sink volume equal the maximum of the
       volumes of the inputs connected to it. Takes a boolean argument, defaults to <b>no</b>.

       <b>rescue-streams=</b> Enable rescuing of streams if the used sink or source becomes unavailable. Takes a
       boolean argument. If set to <b>yes</b>, pulseaudio will try to move the streams from a sink or source that
       becomes unavailable to the default sink or source. If set to <b>no</b>, streams will be killed if the
       corresponding sink or source disappears. Defaults to <b>yes</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SCHEDULING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>high-priority=</b> Renice the daemon after startup to become a high-priority process. This a good idea if you
       experience drop-outs during playback. However, this is a certain security issue, since it works when
       called SUID root only, or RLIMIT_NICE is used. root is dropped immediately after gaining the nice level
       on startup, thus it is presumably safe. See <b><a href="../man1/pulseaudio.1.html">pulseaudio</a>(1)</b> for more information. Takes a boolean argument,
       defaults to <b>yes</b>. The <b>--high-priority</b> command line option takes precedence.

       <b>realtime-scheduling=</b> Try to acquire SCHED_FIFO scheduling for the IO threads. The same security concerns
       as mentioned above apply. However, if PA enters an endless loop, realtime scheduling causes a system
       lockup. Thus, realtime scheduling should only be enabled on trusted machines for now. Please note that
       only the IO threads of PulseAudio are made real-time. The controlling thread is left a normally scheduled
       thread. Thus enabling the high-priority option is orthogonal. See <b><a href="../man1/pulseaudio.1.html">pulseaudio</a>(1)</b> for more information.
       Takes a boolean argument, defaults to <b>yes</b>. The <b>--realtime</b> command line option takes precedence.

       <b>realtime-priority=</b> The realtime priority to acquire, if <b>realtime-scheduling</b> is enabled. Note: JACK uses
       10 by default, 9 for clients. Thus it is recommended to choose the PulseAudio real-time priorities lower.
       Some PulseAudio threads might choose a priority a little lower or higher than the specified value.
       Defaults to <b>5</b>.

       <b>nice-level=</b> The nice level to acquire for the daemon, if <b>high-priority</b> is enabled. Note: on some
       distributions X11 uses -10 by default. Defaults to -11.

</pre><h4><b>IDLE</b> <b>TIMES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>exit-idle-time=</b> Terminate the daemon after the last client quit and this time in seconds passed. Use a
       negative value to disable this feature. Defaults to 20. The <b>--exit-idle-time</b> command line option takes
       precedence.

              When PulseAudio runs in the per-user mode and detects a login session,  then  any  positive  value
              will  be  reset  to  0  so  that PulseAudio will terminate immediately on logout. A positive value
              therefore has effect only in environments where there's no support for login session tracking  (or
              if  the user is logged in without a session spawned, a.k.a. lingering). A negative value can still
              be used to disable any automatic exit.

              When PulseAudio runs in the system mode, automatic exit is always disabled, so  this  option  does
              nothing.

       <b>scache-idle-time=</b> Unload autoloaded sample cache entries after being idle for this time in seconds.
       Defaults to 20. The <b>--scache-idle-time</b> command line option takes precedence.

</pre><h4><b>PATHS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dl-search-path=</b> The path where to look for dynamic shared objects (DSOs/plugins). You may specify more
       than one path separated by colons. The default path depends on compile time settings. The <b>--dl-search-</b>
       <b>path</b> command line option takes precedence.

       <b>default-script-file=</b> The default configuration script file to load. Specify an empty string for not
       loading a default script file. The default behaviour is to load <u><a href="file:~/.config/pulse/default.pa">~/.config/pulse/default.pa</a></u>, and if that
       file does not exist fall back to the system wide installed version <u>/etc/pulse/default.pa</u>. If run in
       system-wide mode the file <u>/etc/pulse/system.pa</u> is used instead. If <b>-n</b> is passed on the command line or
       <b>default-script-file=</b> is disabled the default configuration script is ignored.

       <b>load-default-script-file=</b> Load the default configuration script file as specified in <b>default-script-</b>
       <b>file=</b>. Defaults to <b>yes</b>.

</pre><h4><b>LOGGING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>log-target=</b> The default log target. Use either <b>stderr</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>journal</b> (optional), <b>auto</b>, <b>file:PATH</b> or
       <b>newfile:PATH</b>. On traditional systems <b>auto</b> is equivalent to <b>syslog</b>. On systemd-enabled systems, auto is
       equivalent to <b>journal</b>, in case <b>daemonize</b> is enabled, and to <b>stderr</b> otherwise. If set to <b>file:PATH</b>,
       logging is directed to the file indicated by PATH. <b>newfile:PATH</b> is otherwise the same as <b>file:PATH</b>, but
       existing files are never overwritten. If the specified file already exists, a suffix is added to the file
       name to avoid overwriting. Defaults to <b>auto</b>. The <b>--log-target</b> command line option takes precedence.

       <b>log-level=</b> Log level, one of <b>debug</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>error</b>. Log messages with a lower log level
       than specified here are not logged. Defaults to <b>notice</b>. The <b>--log-level</b> command line option takes
       precedence. The <b>-v</b> command line option might alter this setting.

       <b>log-meta=</b> With each logged message log the code location the message was generated from. Defaults to <b>no</b>.

       <b>log-time=</b> With each logged message log the relative time since startup. Defaults to <b>no</b>.

       <b>log-backtrace=</b> When greater than 0, with each logged message log a code stack trace up the specified
       number of stack frames. Defaults to <b>0</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCE</b> <b>LIMITS</b></h4><pre>
       See  <b><a href="../man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit</a>(2)</b>  for  more information. Set to -1 if PulseAudio shall not touch the resource limit. Not
       all resource limits are available on all operating systems.

       <b>rlimit-as</b> Defaults to -1.

       <b>rlimit-rss</b> Defaults to -1.

       <b>rlimit-core</b> Defaults to -1.

       <b>rlimit-data</b> Defaults to -1.

       <b>rlimit-fsize</b> Defaults to -1.

       <b>rlimit-nofile</b> Defaults to 256.

       <b>rlimit-stack</b> Defaults to -1.

       <b>rlimit-nproc</b> Defaults to -1.

       <b>rlimit-locks</b> Defaults to -1.

       <b>rlimit-sigpending</b> Defaults to -1.

       <b>rlimit-msgqueue</b> Defaults to -1.

       <b>rlimit-memlock</b> Defaults to 16 KiB. Please note that the JACK client libraries may require more locked
       memory.

       <b>rlimit-nice</b> Defaults to 31. Please make sure that the default nice level as configured with <b>nice-level</b>
       fits in this resource limit, if <b>high-priority</b> is enabled.

       <b>rlimit-rtprio</b> Defaults to 9. Please make sure that the default real-time priority level as configured
       with <b>realtime-priority=</b> fits in this resource limit, if <b>realtime-scheduling</b> is enabled. The JACK client
       libraries require a real-time priority of 9 by default.

       <b>rlimit-rttime</b> Defaults to 1000000.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Most drivers try to open the audio device with these settings and then fall back to lower  settings.  The
       default settings are CD quality: 16bit native endian, 2 channels, 44100 Hz sampling.

       <b>default-sample-format=</b> The default sampling format. See
       https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/SupportedAudioFormats/ for
       possible values.

       <b>default-sample-rate=</b> The default sample frequency.

       <b>default-sample-channels</b> The default number of channels.

       <b>default-channel-map</b> The default channel map.

       <b>alternate-sample-rate</b> The alternate sample frequency. Sinks and sources will use either the default-
       sample-rate value or this alternate value, typically 44.1 or 48kHz. Switching between default and
       alternate values is enabled only when the sinks/sources are suspended. This option is ignored in
       passthrough mode where the stream rate will be used. If set to the same value as the default sample rate,
       this feature is disabled.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>FRAGMENT</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Some hardware drivers require the hardware playback buffer to be subdivided into several fragments. It is
       possible  to  change  these  buffer metrics for machines with high scheduling latencies. Not all possible
       values that may be configured here are available in all  hardware.  The  driver  will  find  the  nearest
       setting supported. Modern drivers that support timer-based scheduling ignore these options.

       <b>default-fragments=</b> The default number of fragments. Defaults to 4.

       <b>default-fragment-size-msec=</b>The duration of a single fragment. Defaults to 25ms (i.e. the total buffer is
       thus 100ms long).

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>DEFERRED</b> <b>VOLUME</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       With  the  flat volume feature enabled, the sink HW volume is set to the same level as the highest volume
       input stream. Any other streams (with lower volumes) have the appropriate adjustment  applied  in  SW  to
       bring them to the correct overall level. Sadly hardware mixer changes cannot be timed accurately and thus
       this  change  of volumes can sometimes cause the resulting output sound to be momentarily too loud or too
       soft. So to ensure SW and HW volumes are applied concurrently without  any  glitches,  their  application
       needs  to  be  synchronized.  The  sink  implementation  needs to support deferred volumes. The following
       parameters can be used to refine the process.

       <b>enable-deferred-volume=</b> Enable deferred volume for the sinks that support it. This feature is enabled by
       default.

       <b>deferred-volume-safety-margin-usec=</b> The amount of time (in usec) by which the HW volume increases are
       delayed and HW volume decreases are advanced. Defaults to 8000 usec.

       <b>deferred-volume-extra-delay-usec=</b> The amount of time (in usec) by which HW volume changes are delayed.
       Negative values are also allowed. Defaults to 0.
