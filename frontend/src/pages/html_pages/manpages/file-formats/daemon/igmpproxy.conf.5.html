</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       igmpproxy.conf - Configuration file for <b><a href="../man8/igmpproxy.8.html">igmpproxy</a></b>(8) multicast daemon

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>igmpproxy.conf</b>  contains  the  configuration for the <b>igmpproxy</b> multicast daemon. It defines which network
       interfaces should be used by the routing daemon. Each interface must be give one of the following  roles:
       <b>upstream</b> , <b>downstream</b> or <b>disabled</b>

       The  <b>upstream</b>  network  interface  is  the  outgoing  interface which is responsible for communicating to
       available multicast data sources. There can only be one upstream interface.

       <b>Downstream</b> network interfaces  are  the  distribution  interfaces  to  the  destination  networks,  where
       multicast  clients  can join groups and receive multicast data. One or more downstream interfaces must be
       configured.

       On <b>disabled</b> network interfaces all IGMP or multicast  traffic  is  ignored  altogether.  If  multiple  IP
       addresses  is  used  on one single interface (ae. eth0:1 ...), all interface aliases not in use should be
       configured as disabled.

       Any line in the configuration file starting with <b>#</b> is treated as a comment. Keywords and  parameters  can
       be distributed over many lines.  The configuration file has two main keywords:

       <b>quickleave</b>
              Enables  quickleave  mode. In this mode the daemon will send a Leave IGMP message upstream as soon
              as it receives a Leave message for any  downstream  interface.   The  daemon  will  then  ask  for
              Membership  reports  on the downstream interfaces, and if a report is received the group is joined
              again upstream. Normally this is not noticed at all by clients on the downstream networks. If it's
              vital that the daemon should act exactly as a real multicast client  on  the  upstream  interface,
              this  function  should  not  be  used.  Disabling  this  function  increases the risk of bandwidth
              saturation.

       <b>phyint</b> <u>interface</u> <u>role</u> [ ratelimit <u>limit</u> ] [ threshold <u>ttl</u> ] [ altnet <u>networkaddr</u> <u>...</u>  ]
              Defines the state and settings of a network interface.

</pre><h4><b>PHYINT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>interface</b>
              The name of the interface the settings are for. This option is required for phyint settings.

       <b>role</b>
              The role of the interface. This should be either <b>upstream</b> (only one interface), <b>downstream</b> (one or
              more interfaces) or <b>disabled</b> . This option is required.

       <b>ratelimit</b> <u>limit</u>
              Defines a ratelimit for the network interface. If ratelimit is set to 0  (default),  no  ratelimit
              will be applied. This setting is optional.

       <b>threshold</b> <u>ttl</u>
              Defines  the  TTL threshold for the network interface. Packets with a lower TTL than the threshols
              value will be ignored. This setting is optional, and by default the threshold is 1.

       <b>altnet</b> <u>networkaddr</u> ...
              Defines alternate sources for multicasting and IGMP data. The  network  address  must  be  on  the
              following  format  'a.b.c.d/n'.  By  default  the router will accept data from sources on the same
              network as configured on an interface. If the multicast source lies on a remote network, one  must
              define from where traffic should be accepted.

              This  is  especially  useful for the upstream interface, since the source for multicast traffic is
              often from a remote location. Any number of altnet parameters can be specified.

       <b>whitelist</b> <u>networkaddr</u>
              Defines a whitelist for multicast groups. The network address must  be  in  the  following  format
              'a.b.c.d/n'. If you want to allow one single group use a network mask of /32, i.e. 'a.b.c.d/32'.

              By default all multicast groups are allowed on any downstream interface. If at least one whitelist
              entry is defined, all igmp membership reports for not explicitly whitelisted multicast groups will
              be  ignored  and therefore not be served by igmpproxy. This is especially useful, if your provider
              does only allow a predefined set  of  multicast  groups.  These  whitelists  are  only  obeyed  by
              igmpproxy  itself,  they  won't  prevent  any  other  igmp  client  running on the same machine as
              igmpproxy from requesting 'unallowed' multicast groups.

              You may specify as many whitelist entries as needed. Although you should  keep  it  as  simple  as
              possible,  as  this  list  is parsed for every membership report and therefore this increases igmp
              response times. Often used or large groups should be defined first, as parsing ends as soon  as  a
              group matches an entry.

              You  may  also  specify whitelist entries for the upstream interface. Only igmp membership reports
              for explicitly whitelisted multicast groups will be sent out on the upstream  interface.  This  is
              useful if you want to use multicast groups only between your downstream interfaces, like SSDP from
              a UPnP server.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       ## Enable quickleave quickleave
       ## Define settings for eth0 (upstream)
       phyint eth0 upstream
              altnet 10.0.0.0/8

       ## Disable alternate IP on eth0 (eth0:0)
       phyint eth0:0 disabled

       ## Define settings for eth1 (downstream)
       phyint eth1 downstream ratelimit 0 threshold 1

       ## Define settings for eth2 (also downstream)
       phyint eth2 downstream
