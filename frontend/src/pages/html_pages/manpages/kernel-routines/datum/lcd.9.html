</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lcd - Stream HAL data to an LCD screen

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>loadrt</b> <b>lcd</b> <b>fmt_strings=""Plain</b> <b>Text</b> <b>%4.4f\nAnd</b> <b>So</b> <b>on|Second</b> <b>Page,</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Inst""</b>

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lcd</b> (requires a floating-point thread).
              All LCD instances are updated by the same function.

</pre><h4><b>PINS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lcd.</b><u>NN</u><b>.out</b> (u32) out
              The  output byte stream is sent via this pin. One character is sent every thread invocation. There
              in no handshaking provided.

       <b>lcd.</b><u>NN</u><b>.page.</b><u>PP.</u><b>arg.</b><u>NN</u> (float/s32/u32/bit) in
              The input pins have types matched to the format string specifiers.

       <b>lcd.</b><u>NN</u><b>.page_num</b> (u32) in
              Selects the page number. Multiple layouts may be defined, and this pin switches between them.

       <b>lcd.</b><u>NN</u><b>.contrast</b> (float) in
              Attempts to set the contrast of the LCD screen using the byte sequence ESC C and then a value from
              0x20 to 0xBF (matching the Mesa 7I73).  The value should be between 0 and 1.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lcd.</b><u>NN</u><b>.decimal-separator</b> (u32) rw
              Sets the decimal separator used for floating point numbers. The default value is 46  (0x2E)  which
              corresponds to ".". If a comma is required then set this parameter to 44 (0x2C).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lcd</b>  takes  format  strings  much  like  those used in C and many other languages in the printf and scanf
       functions and their variants.

       The component was written specifically to support the Mesa 7I73 pendant controller, however, it may be of
       use streaming data to other character devices and, as the output format mimics the ADM3 terminal  format,
       it  could  be used to stream data to a serial device. Perhaps even a genuine ADM3.  The strings contain a
       mixture of text values (which are displayed directly), "escaped" formatting codes  and  numerical  format
       descriptors.  For a detailed description of formatting codes see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf</a> .

       The  component can be configured to display an unlimited number of differently-formatted pages, which may
       be selected with a HAL pin.

        <b>Escaped</b> <b>codes</b>
               \n Inserts a clear-to-end, carriage return and line feed character.  This will still linefeed and
              clear even if an automatic wrap has occurred (lcd has  no  knowledge  of  the  width  of  the  lcd
              display).   To  print in the rightmost column it is necessary to allow the format to wrap and omit
              the \n code.

               \t Inserts a tab (actually 4 spaces in the current version rather than a true tab.)

               \NN inserts the character defined by the hexadecimal code NN.
               As the ',' character is used  in  the  format  string  to  separate  LCD  instances  it  must  be
              represented by \2C in the format string (the decimal separator is handled differently).

               \\ Inserts a literal \.

        <b>Numerical</b> <b>formats</b>

              <b>lcd</b>  differs  slightly  from  the standard printf conventions.  One significant difference is that
              width limits are strictly enforced to prevent the LCD display wrapping and  spoiling  the  layout.
              The  field  width  includes  the sign character so that negative numbers will often have a smaller
              valid range than positive.  Numbers that do not fit in the specified width are displayed as a line
              of asterisks (<b>********</b>).

              Each format begins with a "%" symbol. (For a literal % use "%%").  Immediately  after  the  %  the
              following modifiers may be used:

              "  "  (space)  Pad  the number to the specified width with spaces.  This is the default and is not
              strictly necessary.

              "0" Pad the number to the specified width with the numeral 0.

              "+" Force display of a + symbol before positive numbers.  This  (like  the  -  sign)  will  appear
              immediately  to  the left of the digits for a space-padded number and in the extreme left position
              for a 0-padded number.

              "1234567890" A numerical entry (other than the leading  0  above)  defines  the  total  number  of
              characters  to display including the decimal separator and the sign.  Whilst this number can be as
              many digits as required, the maximum field width is 20 characters.  The inherent precision of  the
              "double"  data  type  means  that  more  than  14  digits  will  tend  to show errors in the least
              significant digits.  The integer data types will never fill more than 10 decimal digits.

              Following the width specifier should be the decimal specifier.   This  can  only  be  a  full-stop
              character  (.)  as the comma (,) is used as the instance separator.  Currently lcd does not access
              the locale information to determine the correct separator but the <b>decimal-separator</b> HAL  parameter
              can be used to choose any desired separator.

              Following  the decimal separator should be a number that determines how many places of decimals to
              display. This entry is ignored in the case of integer formats.

              All the above modifiers are optional, but to specify a decimal precision the  decimal  point  must
              precede the precision, e.g., as in "%.3f".  The default decimal precision is 4.

              The numerical formats supported are:

              <b>%f</b>  <b>%F</b>  (for  example,  %+09.3f) These create a floating-point type HAL pin.  The example would be
              displayed in a 9-character field, with 3 places of decimals, as a decimal separator, padded to the
              left with 0s and with a sign displayed for both positive and negative. Conversely a plain %f would
              be 6 digits of decimal, variable format width, with a sign only shown for negative numbers.   Both
              %f and  %F create exactly the same format.

              <b>%i</b>  <b>%d</b> (For example %+ 4d) Creates a signed (s32) HAL pin.  The example would display the value at
              a fixed 4 characters, space padded, width including the "+" giving a range of +999 to -999. %i and
              %d create identical output.

              <b>%u</b> (for example %08u) Creates an unsigned  (u32)  HAL  pin.   The  example  would  be  a  fixed  8
              characters wide, padded with zeros.

              <b>%x,</b>  <b>%X</b>  Creates  an unsigned (u32) HAL pin and displays the value in Hexadecimal.  Both %x and %X
              display capital letters for digits ABCDEF.  A width may be specified, though the u32 HAL  type  is
              only 8 hex digits wide.

              <b>%o</b> Creates an unsigned (u32) pin and displays the value in octal representation.

              <b>%c</b> Creates a u32 HAL pin and displays the character corresponding to the value of the pin.  Values
              less than 32 (space) are suppressed. A width specifier may be used, for example %20c might be used
              to create a complete line of one character.

              <b>%b</b>  This  specifier  has no equivalent in printf.  It creates a bit (boolean) type HAL pin.  The b
              should be followed by two characters and the display will show the first of these when the pin  is
              true, and the second when false.  Note that the characters follow, not precede the "b", unlike the
              case  with  other formats.  The characters may be "escaped" Hex values.  For example "%b\FF " will
              display a solid black block if true, and a space if false and "%b\7F\7E" would display right-arrow
              for false and left-arrow for true.  An unexpected value of 'E' indicates a formatting error.

              <b>Pages</b> The page separator is the "|" (pipe) character (if the actual character is needed  then  \7C
              may  be used).  A "Page" in this context refers to a separate format which may be displayed on the
              same display.

              <b>Instances</b> The instance separator is the comma. This creates a completely  separate  lcd  instance,
              for  example  to  drive  a  second  lcd  display on the second 7I73.  The use of comma to separate
              instances is built in to the modparam reading code so not even escaped commas "\," can be used.  A
              comma may be displayed by using the \2C sequence.
