       threads - creates hard realtime HAL threads

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>loadrt</b> <b>threads</b> <b>name1=</b><u>name</u> <b>period1=</b><u>period</u> [<b>fp1=</b>&lt;<b>0</b>|<b>1</b>&gt;] [&lt;thread-2-info&gt;] [&lt;thread-3-info&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>threads</b>  is  used  to create hard realtime threads which can execute HAL functions at specific intervals.
       It is not a true HAL component, in that it does not export any functions, pins, or parameters of its own.
       Once it has created one or more threads, the threads stand  alone,  and  the  <b>threads</b>  component  can  be
       unloaded  without  affecting  them.   In  fact, it can be unloaded and then reloaded to create additional
       threads, as many times as needed.

       <b>threads</b> can create up to three realtime threads.  Threads must be  created  in  order,  from  fastest  to
       slowest.   Each  thread  is specified by three arguments.  <b>name1</b> is used to specify the name of the first
       thread (thread 1).  <b>period1</b> is used to specify the period of thread 1  in  nanoseconds.   Both  <u>name</u>  and
       <u>period</u>  are  required.   The  third argument, <b>fp1</b> is optional, and is used to specify if thread 1 will be
       used to execute floating  point code.  If not specified, it defaults to <b>1</b>, which means  that  the  thread
       will  support floating point.  Specify <b>0</b> to disable floating point support, which saves a small amount of
       execution time by not saving the FPU context.   For  additional  threads,  <b>name2</b>,  <b>period2</b>,  <b>fp2</b>,  <b>name3</b>,
       <b>period3</b>,  and  <b>fp3</b>  work  exactly  the same.  If more than three threads are needed, unload threads, then
       reload it to create more threads.

       None

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The existence of <b>threads</b> might be considered a bug.  Ideally, creation and deletion of threads  would  be
       done  directly  with  <b>halcmd</b>  commands,  such  as  "<b>newthread</b> <u>name</u> <u>period</u>", "<b>delthread</b> <u>name</u>", or similar.
       However, limitations in the current HAL implementation require thread creation to take  place  in  kernel
       space, and loading a component is the most straightforward way to do that.
