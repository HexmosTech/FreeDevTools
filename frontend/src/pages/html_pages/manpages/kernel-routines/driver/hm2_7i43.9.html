       hm2_7i43  -  LinuxCNC  HAL  driver  for  the  Mesa  Electronics  7i43 EPP Anything IO board with HostMot2
       firmware.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>loadrt</b>  <b>hm2_7i43</b>  <b>[ioaddr=</b><u>N</u><b>[,</b><u>N</u><b>...]]</b>  <b>[ioaddr_hi=</b><u>N</u><b>[,</b><u>N</u><b>...]]</b>   <b>[epp_wide=</b><u>N</u><b>[,</b><u>N</u><b>...]]</b>   <b>[config=</b><u>"str[,str...]"</u><b>]</b>
              <b>[debug_epp=</b><u>N</u><b>[,</b><u>N</u><b>...]]</b>

           <b>ioaddr</b> [default: 0 (parport0)]
                  The base address of the parallel port.

                  The  number  of  ioaddr  indexes/addresses  given  is used by the driver to determine how many
                  boards to search for.

           <b>ioaddr_hi</b> [default: 0]
                  The secondary address of the parallel port, used to set EPP mode.  0 means  to  use  ioaddr  +
                  0x400.

           <b>epp_wide</b> [default: 1]
                  Set  to  zero  to  disable  the  "wide  EPP  mode".   "Wide"  mode allows a 16- and 32-bit EPP
                  transfers, which can reduce the time spent in the read and write functions.  However, this may
                  not work on all EPP parallel ports.

           <b>config</b> [default: ""]
                  HostMot2 config strings, described in the <a href="../man9/hostmot2.9.html">hostmot2</a>(9) manpage.

           <b>debug_epp</b> [default: 0]
                  Developer/debug use only!  Enable debug logging of most EPP transfers.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       hm2_7i43 is a device driver that interfaces the Mesa  7i43  board  with  the  HostMot2  firmware  to  the
       LinuxCNC HAL.  Both the 200K and the 400K FPGAs are supported.

       The  driver talks with the 7i43 over the parallel port, not over USB.  USB can be used to power the 7i43,
       but not to talk to it.  USB communication with the 7i43 will not be supported any time  soon,  since  USB
       has poor real-time qualities.

       The  driver programs the board's FPGA with firmware when it registers the board with the hostmot2 driver.
       The firmware to load is specified in the <b>config</b> modparam, as described in the <a href="../man9/hostmot2.9.html">hostmot2</a>(9) manpage, in the
       <u>config</u> <u>modparam</u> section.

</pre><h4><b>Jumper</b> <b>settings</b></h4><pre>
       To send the FPGA configuration from the PC, the board must be configured to get its firmware from the EPP
       port.  To do this, jumpers W4 and W5 must both be down, ie toward the USB connector.

       The board must be configured to power on whether or not the USB interface is active.   This  is  done  by
       setting jumper W7 up, ie away from the edge of the board.

</pre><h4><b>Communicating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b></h4><pre>
       The  7i43  communicates  with  the LinuxCNC computer over EPP, the Enhanced Parallel Port.  This provides
       about 1 MBps of throughput, and the communication latency is very predictable and reasonably low.

       The parallel port must support EPP 1.7 or EPP 1.9.  EPP 1.9 is preferred, but EPP 1.7 will work too.  The
       EPP mode of the parallel port is sometimes a setting in the BIOS.

       Note that the popular "NetMOS" aka "MosChip 9805" PCI parport cards <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b>.  They do  not  meet  the
       EPP spec, and cannot be reliably used with the 7i43.  You have to find another card, sorry.

       EPP  is  very  reliable  under normal circumstances, but bad cabling or excessively long cabling runs may
       cause communication timeouts.  The driver  exports  a  parameter  named  hm2_7i43.&lt;BoardNum&gt;.io_error  to
       inform HAL of this condition.  When the driver detects an EPP timeout, it sets io_error to True and stops
       communicating  with  the  7i43  board.   Setting  io_error back to False makes the driver start trying to
       communicate with the 7i43 again.

       Access to the EPP bus is not threadsafe: only one realtime thread may access the EPP bus.
