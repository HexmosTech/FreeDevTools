</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mouse - serial mouse interface

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Serial mice are connected to a serial RS232/V24 dialout line, see <b><a href="../man4/ttyS.4.html">ttyS</a></b>(4) for a description.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Introduction</b>
       The pinout of the usual 9 pin plug as used for serial mice is:

                                           pin   name   used for
                                             2    RX    Data
                                             3    TX    -12 V, Imax = 10 mA
                                             4   DTR    +12 V, Imax = 10 mA
                                             7   RTS    +12 V, Imax = 10 mA
                                             5   GND    Ground

       This is the specification, in fact 9 V suffices with most mice.

       The  mouse  driver  can recognize a mouse by dropping RTS to low and raising it again.  About 14 ms later
       the mouse will send 0x4D ('M') on the data line.  After a further 63 ms, a Microsoft-compatible  3-button
       mouse will send 0x33 ('3').

       The  relative  mouse movement is sent as <u>dx</u> (positive means right) and <u>dy</u> (positive means down).  Various
       mice can operate at different speeds.  To select speeds, cycle through the speeds 9600, 4800,  2400,  and
       1200  bit/s,  each  time  writing  the  two characters from the table below and waiting 0.1 seconds.  The
       following table shows available speeds and the strings that select them:

                                                    bit/s   string
                                                    9600    *q
                                                    4800    *p
                                                    2400    *o
                                                    1200    *n

       The first byte of a data packet can be used for synchronization purposes.

   <b>Microsoft</b> <b>protocol</b>
       The <b>Microsoft</b> protocol uses 1 start bit, 7 data bits, no parity and one stop bit at  the  speed  of  1200
       bits/sec.   Data is sent to RxD in 3-byte packets.  The <u>dx</u> and <u>dy</u> movements are sent as two's-complement,
       <u>lb</u> (<u>rb</u>) are set when the left (right) button is pressed:

                                     byte   d6   d5    d4    d3    d2    d1    d0
                                        1   1    lb    rb    dy7   dy6   dx7   dx6
                                        2   0    dx5   dx4   dx3   dx2   dx1   dx0
                                        3   0    dy5   dy4   dy3   dy2   dy1   dy0

   <b>3-button</b> <b>Microsoft</b> <b>protocol</b>
       Original Microsoft mice only have two buttons.  However, there are some three button mice which also  use
       the  Microsoft  protocol.   Pressing  or releasing the middle button is reported by sending a packet with
       zero movement and no buttons pressed.  (Thus, unlike for the other two buttons, the status of the  middle
       button is not reported in each packet.)

   <b>Logitech</b> <b>protocol</b>
       Logitech serial 3-button mice use a different extension of the Microsoft protocol: when the middle button
       is  up,  the  above 3-byte packet is sent.  When the middle button is down a 4-byte packet is sent, where
       the 4th byte has value 0x20 (or at least has the 0x20 bit set).  In particular, a  press  of  the  middle
       button is reported as 0,0,0,0x20 when no other buttons are down.

   <b>Mousesystems</b> <b>protocol</b>
       The  <b>Mousesystems</b>  protocol  uses  1 start bit, 8 data bits, no parity, and two stop bits at the speed of
       1200 bits/sec.  Data is sent to RxD in 5-byte packets.  <u>dx</u> is sent as the sum of the two two's-complement
       values, <u>dy</u> is send as negated sum of the two two's-complement values.  <u>lb</u> (<u>mb</u>, <u>rb</u>) are cleared  when  the
       left (middle, right) button is pressed:

                              byte   d7    d6     d5     d4     d3     d2     d1     d0
                                 1   1     0      0      0      0      lb     mb     rb
                                 2   0    dxa6   dxa5   dxa4   dxa3   dxa2   dxa1   dxa0
                                 3   0    dya6   dya5   dya4   dya3   dya2   dya1   dya0
                                 4   0    dxb6   dxb5   dxb4   dxb3   dxb2   dxb1   dxb0
                                 5   0    dyb6   dyb5   dyb4   dyb3   dyb2   dyb1   dyb0

       Bytes 4 and 5 describe the change that occurred since bytes 2 and 3 were transmitted.

   <b>Sun</b> <b>protocol</b>
       The  <b>Sun</b> protocol is the 3-byte version of the above 5-byte Mousesystems protocol: the last two bytes are
       not sent.

   <b>MM</b> <b>protocol</b>
       The <b>MM</b> protocol uses 1 start bit, 8 data bits, odd parity,  and  one  stop  bit  at  the  speed  of  1200
       bits/sec.   Data  is sent to RxD in 3-byte packets.  <u>dx</u> and <u>dy</u> are sent as single signed values, the sign
       bit indicating a negative value.  <u>lb</u> (<u>mb</u>, <u>rb</u>) are set when the left (middle, right) button is pressed:

                                  byte   d7   d6    d5    d4    d3    d2    d1    d0
                                     1   1     0     0    dxs   dys   lb    mb    rb
                                     2   0    dx6   dx5   dx4   dx3   dx2   dx1   dx0
                                     3   0    dy6   dy5   dy4   dy3   dy2   dy1   dy0
