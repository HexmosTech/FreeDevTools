</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       solver_abtb - mixed systems solver (rheolef-7.2)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           solver_abtb stokes     (a,b,mp);
           solver_abtb elasticity (a,b,c,mp);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class provides both direct and iterative algorithms for solving mixed problem:

          [ A  B^T ] [ u ]    [ Mf ]
          [        ] [   ]  = [    ]
          [ B  -C  ] [ p ]    [ Mg ]

        where A is symmetric positive definite and C is symmetric positive. By default, iterative algorithms are
       considered for tridimensional problems and direct methods otherwise. A <b><a href="../man4/solver_option.4.html">solver_option</a>(4)</b> argument can
       change this default behavior. Mixed linear problems appears for instance with the discretization of
       Stokes and elasticity problems. The C matrix can be zero and then the corresponding argument can be
       omitted when invoking the constructor. Non-zero C matrix appears for of Stokes problems with stabilized
       P1-P1 element, or for nearly incompressible elasticity problems.

       Recall that, for 1D and 2D problems, the direct method is default, since it is more efficient: see e.g.
       <b>usersguide</b>. The <b><a href="../man4/solver_option.4.html">solver_option</a>(4)</b> allows one to change this default behavior.

</pre><h4><b>DIRECT</b> <b>ALGORITHM</b></h4><pre>
       When the kernel of B^T is reduced to zero, the global system is non-singular and the <b><a href="../man4/solver.4.html">solver</a>(4)</b> method
       could be applied. Otherwise, when the kernel of B^T is not reduced to zero, then the pressure p is
       defined up to a constant and the system is singular. This is a major difficulty for any direct method.
       Thus, the system is first completed by the imposition of an additional constraint on the pressure term:
       it should have a zero average value. By this way, the system becomes non-singular and the <b><a href="../man4/solver.4.html">solver</a>(4)</b>
       method could be applied.

</pre><h4><b>ITERATIVE</b> <b>ALGORITHM</b></h4><pre>
       The <b><a href="../man5/cg.5.html">cg</a>(5)</b> preconditionned conjugate gradient algorithm or the <b><a href="../man5/gmres.5.html">gmres</a>(5)</b> one is used, depending on the
       symmetry of the matrix. The mp matrix is used as preconditionner: it can be customized by the
       set_preconditionner member function. The linear sub-systems related to the A matrix are also solved by an
       inner solver. This inner solver is automatically defined by default: it can be customized by the
       set_inner_solver member function and e.g. uses it own inner iterative algorithm and preconditionner.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       See the <b>usersguide</b> for practical examples for the nearly incompressible elasticity, the Stokes and the
       Navier-Stokes problems.
