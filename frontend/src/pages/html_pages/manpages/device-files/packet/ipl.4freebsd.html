</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ipl - IP packet log device

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ipl</b> pseudo device's purpose is to provide an easy way to gather packet headers of packets you wish to
       log.  If a packet header is to be logged, the entire header is logged (including any IP options - TCP/UDP
       options  are  not  included  when it calculates header size) or not at all.  The packet contents are also
       logged after the header.  If the log reader is busy or otherwise  unable  to  read  log  records,  up  to
       IPLLOGSIZE (8192 is the default) bytes of data are stored.

       Prepending  every  packet  header  logged  is  a  structure containing information relevant to the packet
       following and why it was logged.  The structure's format is as follows:

       /*
        * Log structure.  Each packet header logged is prepended by one of these.
        * Following this in the log records read from the device will be an ipflog
        * structure which is then followed by any packet data.
        */
       typedef struct iplog    {
               u_long  ipl_sec;
               u_long  ipl_usec;
               u_int   ipl_len;
               u_int   ipl_count;
               size_t  ipl_dsize;
               struct  iplog   *ipl_next;
       } iplog_t;

       typedef struct  ipflog  {
       #if (defined(NetBSD) &amp;&amp; (NetBSD &lt;= 1991011) &amp;&amp; (NetBSD &gt;= 199603))
               u_char  fl_ifname[IFNAMSIZ];
       #else
               u_int   fl_unit;
               u_char  fl_ifname[4];
       #endif
               u_char  fl_plen;        /* extra data after hlen */
               u_char  fl_hlen;        /* length of IP headers saved */
               u_short fl_rule;        /* assume never more than 64k rules, total */
               u_32_t  fl_flags;
       } ipflog_t;

       When reading from the <b>ipl</b> device, it is necessary to call <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a>(2) with a buffer big  enough  to  hold  at
       least 1 complete log record - reading of partial log records is not supported.

       If  the  packet contents are more than 128 bytes when <b>log</b> <b>body</b> is used, then only 128 bytes of the packet
       contents are logged.

       Although it is only possible to read from the <b>ipl</b> device, opening it for writing is required  when  using
       an ioctl which changes any kernel data.

       The  ioctls  which  are  loaded with this device can be found under <b><a href="../man4/ipf.4.html">ipf</a>(4)</b>.  The ioctls which are for use
       with logging and don't affect the filter are:

               ioctl(fd, SIOCIPFFB, int *)
               ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, int *)

       The SIOCIPFFB ioctl flushes the log buffer and returns the number of bytes flushed.  FIONREAD returns the
       number of bytes currently used for storing log data.  If IPFILTER_LOG  is  not  defined  when  compiling,
       SIOCIPFFB is not available and FIONREAD will return but not do anything.

       There is currently no support for non-blocking IO with this device, meaning all read operations should be
       considered blocking in nature (if there is no data to read, it will sleep until some is made available).

       <a href="../man4/ipf.4.html">ipf</a>(4)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Packet headers are dropped when the internal buffer (static size) fills.
