       arp — Address Resolution Protocol

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>device</b> <b>ether</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Address  Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to dynamically map between Protocol Addresses (such as IP
       addresses) and Local Network Addresses  (such  as  Ethernet  addresses).   This  implementation  maps  IP
       addresses  to  Ethernet,  ARCnet,  or  Token  Ring  addresses.   It is used by all the Ethernet interface
       drivers.

       ARP caches Internet-Ethernet address mappings.  When an interface requests a mapping for an  address  not
       in  the  cache,  ARP  queues  the  message  which  requires  the  mapping and broadcasts a message on the
       associated network requesting the address mapping.  If a response is provided, the new mapping is  cached
       and  any  pending message is transmitted.  ARP will queue at most one packet while waiting for a response
       to a mapping request; only the most recently ``transmitted'' packet is kept.  If the target host does not
       respond after several requests, the host is considered to be down allowing an error  to  be  returned  to
       transmission  attempts.   Further  demand  for  this mapping causes ARP request retransmissions, that are
       ratelimited to one packet per second.  The error is EHOSTDOWN for a non-responding destination host,  and
       EHOSTUNREACH for a non-responding router.

       The  ARP  cache is stored in the system routing table as dynamically-created host routes.  The route to a
       directly-attached Ethernet network is installed as a “cloning” route (one with the <b>RTF_CLONING</b> flag set),
       causing routes to individual hosts on that network to be  created  on  demand.   These  routes  time  out
       periodically (normally 20 minutes after validated; entries are not validated when not in use).

       ARP  entries  may  be  added,  deleted or changed with the <u><a href="../man8/arp.8.html">arp</a></u>(8) utility.  Manually-added entries may be
       temporary or permanent, and may be “published”, in which case the system will respond to ARP requests for
       that host as if it were the target of the request.

       In the past, ARP was used to negotiate the use of a trailer encapsulation.  This is no longer supported.

       ARP watches passively for hosts impersonating the local host (i.e., a  host  which  responds  to  an  ARP
       mapping request for the local host's address).

       Proxy  ARP  is a feature whereby the local host will respond to requests for addresses other than itself,
       with its own address.  Normally, proxy ARP in FreeBSD is set up on a host-by-host basis using the  <u><a href="../man8/arp.8.html">arp</a></u>(8)
       utility,  by  adding  an  entry for each host inside a given subnet for which proxying of ARP requests is
       desired.  However, the “proxy all” feature causes the local  host  to  act  as  a  proxy  for  <u>all</u>  hosts
       reachable  through some other network interface, different from the one the request came in from.  It may
       be enabled by setting the <u><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></u>(8) MIB variable <u>net.link.ether.inet.proxyall</u> to 1.

</pre><h4><b>MIB</b> <b>Variables</b></h4><pre>
       The ARP protocol implements a number of configurable  variables  in  <u>net.link.ether.inet</u>  branch  of  the
       <u><a href="../man3/sysctl.3.html">sysctl</a></u>(3) MIB.

       <u>allow_multicast</u>           Install  ARP  entries  with  the  multicast  bit  set  in the hardware address.
                                 Installing such entries is an RFC 1812 violation,  but  some  proprietary  load
                                 balancing techniques require routers to do so.  Turned off by default.

       <u>garp_rexmit_count</u>         Retransmit  gratuitous  ARP  (GARP) packets when an IPv4 address is added to an
                                 interface.  A GARP is always transmitted when an IPv4 address is  added  to  an
                                 interface.   A  non-zero  value  causes the GARP packet to be retransmitted the
                                 stated number of times.  The interval between retransmissions is  doubled  each
                                 time,  so  the  retransmission  intervals are: {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...} (seconds).
                                 The default value of zero means only the initial GARP is  sent;  no  additional
                                 GARP packets are retransmitted.  The maximum value is sixteen.

                                 The default behavior of a single GARP packet is usually sufficient.  However, a
                                 single  GARP  might  be  dropped  or  lost  in  some  circumstances.   This  is
                                 particularly harmful when a shared address is  passed  between  cluster  nodes.
                                 Neighbors  on  the network link might then work with a stale ARP cache and send
                                 packets destined for that  address  to  the  node  that  previously  owned  the
                                 address, which might not respond.

       <u>log_arp_movements</u>         Log  movements  of  IP  addresses  from  one  hardware address to another.  See
                                 “DIAGNOSTICS” below.  Turned on by default.

       <u>log_arp_permanent_modify</u>  Log  attempts  by  a  remote  host  to  modify  a  permanent  ARP  entry.   See
                                 “DIAGNOSTICS” below.  Turned on by default.

       <u>log_arp_wrong_iface</u>       Log  attempts  to  insert  an  ARP entry on an interface when the IP network to
                                 which the address belongs is connected to another interface.  See “DIAGNOSTICS”
                                 below.  Turned on by default.

       <u>max_log_per_second</u>        Limit the number of remotely triggered logging events to a configured value per
                                 second.  Default is 1 log message per second.

       <u>max_age</u>                   How long an ARP entry is held in the cache until  it  needs  to  be  refreshed.
                                 Default is 1200 seconds.

       <u>maxhold</u>                   How many packets to hold in the per-entry output queue while the entry is being
                                 resolved.  Default is one packet.

       <u>maxtries</u>                  Number  of  retransmits  before  a  host  is  considered  down  and an error is
                                 returned.  Default is 5 tries.

       <u>proxyall</u>                  Enables ARP proxying.  Turned off by default.

       <u>wait</u>                      Lifetime of an incomplete ARP entry.  Default is 20 seconds.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>arp:</b> <b>%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x</b> <b>is</b> <b>using</b> <b>my</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> <b>%d.%d.%d.%d</b> <b>on</b> <b>%s!</b>  ARP has discovered another host on  the
       local  network  which responds to mapping requests for its own Internet address with a different Ethernet
       address, generally indicating that two hosts are attempting to use the same Internet address.

       <b>arp:</b> <b>link</b> <b>address</b> <b>is</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>for</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> <b>%d.%d.%d.%d!</b>  ARP requested information  for  a  host,  and
       received  an  answer indicating that the host's ethernet address is the ethernet broadcast address.  This
       indicates a misconfigured or broken device.

       <b>arp:</b> <b>%d.%d.%d.%d</b> <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x</b> <b>to</b> <b>%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x</b> <b>on</b> <b>%s</b>  ARP had a cached value for  the
       ethernet  address  of  the  referenced  host,  but  received a reply indicating that the host is at a new
       address.  This can happen normally when host hardware addresses change, or when a mobile node arrives  or
       leaves the local subnet.  It can also indicate a problem with proxy ARP.  This message can only be issued
       if the sysctl <u>net.link.ether.inet.log_arp_movements</u> is set to 1, which is the system's default behaviour.

       <b>arpresolve:</b>  <b>can't</b>  <b>allocate</b> <b>llinfo</b> <b>for</b> <b>%d.%d.%d.%d</b>  The route for the referenced host points to a device
       upon which ARP is required, but ARP was unable to allocate a routing table entry in which  to  store  the
       host's  MAC  address.   This  usually  points to a misconfigured routing table.  It can also occur if the
       kernel cannot allocate memory.

       <b>arp:</b> <b>%d.%d.%d.%d</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>if0</b> <b>but</b> <b>got</b> <b>reply</b> <b>from</b> <b>%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x</b> <b>on</b> <b>if1</b>  Physical connections exist to the
       same logical IP network on both if0 and if1.  It can also occur if an entry already  exists  in  the  ARP
       cache  for  the  IP address above, and the cable has been disconnected from if0, then reconnected to if1.
       This message can only be issued if the sysctl <u>net.link.ether.inet.log_arp_wrong_iface</u> is set to 1,  which
       is the system's default behaviour.

       <b>arp:</b>  <b>%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>entry</b> <b>for</b> <b>%d.%d.%d.%d</b> <b>on</b> <b>%s</b>  ARP has received an ARP
       reply that attempts to overwrite a permanent entry in the local ARP  table.   This  error  will  only  be
       logged  if  the  sysctl  <u>net.link.ether.inet.log_arp_permanent_modify</u>  is set to 1, which is the system's
       default behaviour.

       <b>arp:</b> <b>%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x</b> <b>is</b> <b>multicast</b>  Kernel refused to install an entry with multicast hardware  address.
       If  you really want such addresses being installed, set the sysctl <u>net.link.ether.inet.allow_multicast</u> to
       a positive value.
