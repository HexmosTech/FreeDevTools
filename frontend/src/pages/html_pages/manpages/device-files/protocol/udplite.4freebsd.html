       udplite — Lightweight User Datagram Protocol

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</b>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</b>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;netinet/udplite.h&gt;</b>

       <u>int</u>
       <b>socket</b>(<u>AF_INET</u>, <u>SOCK_DGRAM</u>, <u>IPPROTO_UDPLITE</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The UDP-Lite protocol provides a partial checksum which allows corrupted packets to be transmitted to the
       receiving  application.   This  has advantages for some types of multimedia transport that may be able to
       make use of slightly damaged datagrams, rather than having them discarded by lower-layer protocols.

       UDP-Lite supports a number of socket options  which  can  be  set  with  <u><a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt</a></u>(2)  and  tested  with
       <u><a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</a></u>(2):

       UDPLITE_SEND_CSCOV  This  option  sets  the sender checksum coverage.  A value of zero indicates that all
                           sent packets will have full checksum coverage.  A value of  8  to  65535  limits  the
                           checksum coverage of all sent packets to the value given.

       UDPLITE_RECV_CSCOV  This  option  is the receiver-side analogue.  A value of zero instructs the kernel to
                           drop all received packets not having full checksum coverage.  A value of 8  to  65535
                           instructs  the  kernel  to drop all received packets with a partial checksum coverage
                           smaller than the value specified.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       A socket operation may fail with one of the following errors returned:

       [EISCONN]          when trying to establish a connection on a socket  which  already  has  one,  or  when
                          trying  to  send  a  datagram with the destination address specified and the socket is
                          already connected;

       [ENOTCONN]         when trying to send a datagram, but no  destination  address  is  specified,  and  the
                          socket has not been connected;

       [ENOBUFS]          when the system runs out of memory for an internal data structure;

       [EADDRINUSE]       when  an  attempt  is  made  to  create  a  socket  with a port which has already been
                          allocated;

       [EADDRNOTAVAIL]    when an attempt is made to create a socket with a network address for which no network
                          interface exists.
