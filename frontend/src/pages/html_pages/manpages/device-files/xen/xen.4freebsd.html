       xen — Xen Hypervisor Guest (DomU) Support

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile hardware-assisted virtualization (HVM) Xen guest support with para-virtualized drivers into an
       amd64 or i386 kernel, place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>options</b> <b>XENHVM</b>
             <b>device</b> <b>xenpci</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Xen  Hypervisor  allows multiple virtual machines to be run on a single computer system.  When first
       released, Xen required that i386 kernels be compiled "para-virtualized" as the x86  instruction  set  was
       not  fully  virtualizable.   Primarily,  para-virtualization  modifies  the  virtual memory system to use
       hypervisor calls (hypercalls) rather than direct hardware instructions to modify the TLB, although  para-
       virtualized  device drivers were also required to access resources such as virtual network interfaces and
       disk devices.

       With later instruction set extensions from AMD and Intel to  support  fully  virtualizable  instructions,
       unmodified  virtual  memory  systems  can  also  be  supported;  this is referred to as hardware-assisted
       virtualization (HVM).  HVM configurations may either rely on transparently emulated hardware peripherals,
       or para-virtualized drivers, which are aware of  virtualization,  and  hence  able  to  optimize  certain
       behaviors to improve performance or semantics.

       FreeBSD supports hardware-assisted virtualization (HVM) on both i386 and amd64 kernels.

       Para-virtualized  device  drivers  are  required  in  order  to  support  certain  functionality, such as
       processing management requests, returning idle physical memory pages to the hypervisor, etc.

   <b>Xen</b> <b>DomU</b> <b>device</b> <b>drivers</b>
       These para-virtualized drivers are supported:

             <b>balloon</b>   Allow physical memory pages to be returned to the hypervisor as a result of manual tuning
                       or automatic policy.

             <b>blkback</b>   Exports local block devices or files to other Xen domains where they can then be imported
                       via <b>blkfront</b>.

             <b>blkfront</b>  Import block devices from other Xen domains as local block devices, to be used  for  file
                       systems, swap, etc.

             <b>console</b>   Export the low-level system console via the Xen console service.

             <b>control</b>   Process management operations from Domain 0, including power off, reboot, suspend, crash,
                       and halt requests.

             <b>evtchn</b>    Expose Xen events via the <u>/dev/xen/evtchn</u> special device.

             <b>netback</b>   Export  local  network  interfaces  to  other  Xen domains where they can be imported via
                       <b>netfront</b>.

             <b>netfront</b>  Import network interfaces from other Xen domains as local network interfaces,  which  may
                       be used for IPv4, IPv6, etc.

             <b>pcifront</b>  Allow physical PCI devices to be passed through into a PV domain.

             <b>xenpci</b>    Represents  the  Xen  PCI  device, an emulated PCI device that is exposed to HVM domains.
                       This device allows detection of the Xen hypervisor, and  provides  interrupt  and  shared
                       memory services required to interact with the hypervisor.

   <b>Performance</b> <b>considerations</b>
       In  general, PV drivers will perform better than emulated hardware, and are the recommended configuration
       for HVM installations.

       Using a hypervisor introduces a second layer of scheduling that may limit the  effectiveness  of  certain
       FreeBSD  scheduling optimisations.  Among these is adaptive locking, which is no longer able to determine
       whether a thread holding a lock is in execution.  It is recommended that  adaptive  locking  be  disabled
       when using Xen:

             <b>options</b> <b>NO_ADAPTIVE_MUTEXES</b>
             <b>options</b> <b>NO_ADAPTIVE_RWLOCKS</b>
             <b>options</b> <b>NO_ADAPTIVE_SX</b>

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Support for <b>xen</b> first appeared in FreeBSD 8.1.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       FreeBSD   support   for   Xen   was   first  added  by  Kip  Macy  &lt;<u><a href="mailto:kmacy@FreeBSD.org">kmacy@FreeBSD.org</a></u>&gt;  and  Doug  Rabson
       &lt;<u><a href="mailto:dfr@FreeBSD.org">dfr@FreeBSD.org</a></u>&gt;.  Further refinements were made  by  Justin  Gibbs  &lt;<u><a href="mailto:gibbs@FreeBSD.org">gibbs@FreeBSD.org</a></u>&gt;,  Adrian  Chadd
       &lt;<u><a href="mailto:adrian@FreeBSD.org">adrian@FreeBSD.org</a></u>&gt;,  and Colin Percival &lt;<u><a href="mailto:cperciva@FreeBSD.org">cperciva@FreeBSD.org</a></u>&gt;.  This manual page was written by Robert
       Watson &lt;<u><a href="mailto:rwatson@FreeBSD.org">rwatson@FreeBSD.org</a></u>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       FreeBSD is only able to run as a Xen guest (DomU) and not as a Xen host (Dom0).

       As of this release, Xen PV DomU support is not heavily tested; instability has been  reported  during  VM
       migration of PV kernels.

       Certain PV driver features, such as the balloon driver, are under-exercised.
