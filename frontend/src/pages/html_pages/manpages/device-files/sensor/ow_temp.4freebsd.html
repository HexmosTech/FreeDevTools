</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ow_temp — Dallas Semiconductor 1-Wire Temperature sensor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>device</b> <b>ow_temp</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ow_temp</b> module supports many of the 1-Wire temperature sensors.

       The sensor is read periodically and the results returned via a <u><a href="../man3/sysctl.3.html">sysctl</a></u>(3) as described below.

</pre><h4><b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       These temperature sensors are supported by the <b>ow_temp</b> driver:
       DS1820    1-Wire Digital Thermometer
       DS18S20   High-Precision 1-Wire Digital Thermometer
       DS18B20   Programmable Resolution 1-Wire Digital Thermometer
       DS1822    Econo 1-Wire Digital Thermometer
       DS1825    Programmable Resolution 1-Wire Digital Thermometer with 4-bit ID
       MAX31820  1-Wire, Parasite-Power, Ambient Temperature Sensor

       The driver supports Family codes 0x10, 0x22, 0x28, and 0x3b.

</pre><h4><b>SYSCTL</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ow_temp</b> driver reports data via <u><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></u>(8) entries in the device's node in the <u><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></u>(8) tree:

       temperature
                   The last temperature read, in milli-Kelvin.

       badcrc      The  number of CRC errors in reading the temperature form the device.  Some CRC errors are to
                   be expected.  High rates of CRC errors, however,  generally  indicate  a  noisy  environment,
                   cabling issues, or too many devices on the bus.

       badread     The  number  of  times a non-CRC error was encountered reading the temperature from the card.
                   This type of error is very rare.

       reading_interval
                   The time, in ticks, between successive reads of the sensor.

       parasite    This item is non-zero when the device is connected using its parasitic power  mode.   It  can
                   also indicate a wiring error.

       Temperatures  are  reported  in milli-Kelvin, even though the absolute accuracy is around 0.2 degrees for
       the good devices and around 1 degree for cheaper devices.  The devices report in steps of 0.0625 degrees.
       The driver preserves the precision of the device's measurements in its <u><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></u>(8) reports.  These  devices
       often  have  a  much higher relative accuracy and repeatability than their absolute accuracy.  This makes
       them well suited for control loops that strive for stability and become possible if the full precision is
       preserved.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ow_temp</b> driver first appeared in FreeBSD 11.0.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ow_temp</b> device driver and this manual page were written by Warner Losh.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The parasitic mode of the devices does not work.  It requires support from  the  <u><a href="../man4/owc.4.html">owc</a></u>(4)  driver  that  is
       unimplemented.

       The ID bits from the <u>DS1825</u> are not recognized or reported.

       The type of the device is not reported via <u><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></u>(8).

       Alarm mode is not supported.  It is not possible to set the low and high alarm temperatures.

       There is no way to write to the EEPROM.

       “Convert  Temperature”  requests  are  sent directly to the device.  There is no way to use the broadcast
       ability of the 1-Wire bus to do all the conversions in parallel.

       It is not possible to set the precision on those devices that support it.

       The time to convert is fixed at 1 second, even though some devices are faster.

       There is no character device to supply a stream of readings to a program.   Programs  interested  in  the
       temperature must poll the sysctl to get the temperature.
