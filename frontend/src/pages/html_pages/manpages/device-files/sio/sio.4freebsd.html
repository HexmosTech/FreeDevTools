</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sio</b>  driver  provides  support  for NS8250-, NS16450-, NS16550 and NS16550A-based EIA RS-232C (CCITT
       V.24) communications interfaces.  The NS8250 and NS16450 have single character buffers, the NS16550A  has
       16 character FIFO input and output buffers.

       Input and output for each line may set to one of following baud rates; 50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600,
       1200,  1800,  2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 28800, 38400, 57600, or 115200.  Your hardware may limit your baud
       rate choices.

       The driver supports `multiport' cards.  Multiport cards are those that have one or more groups  of  ports
       that  share an Interrupt Request (IRQ) line per group.  Shared IRQs on different cards are not supported.
       Frequently 4 ports share 1 IRQ; some 8 port cards have 2 groups of 4 ports,  thus  using  2  IRQs.   Some
       cards allow the first 2 serial ports to have separate IRQs per port (as per DOS PC standard).

       Some  cards  have  an  IRQ  control  register  for each group.  Some cards require special initialization
       related to such registers.  Only AST/4 compatible IRQ control registers are supported.  Some  cards  have
       an  IRQ status register for each group.  The driver does not require or use such registers yet.  To work,
       the control and status registers for a group, if any, must be mapped to the scratch register (register 7)
       of a port in the group.  Such a port is called a <u>master</u> port.

       The driver supports controller based PCI modems.  The 3Com  FaxModem  PCI  and  the  Advantec  56k  Voice
       Messaging  PCI  FaxModem  are  the only cards supported.  WinModems, softmodems, hfc modems and any other
       modems that are not controller based are not supported.

       The <u>flags</u> keyword may be used on each <u>device</u> <u>sio</u> line in the kernel configuration  file  to  disable  the
       FIFO on 16550A UARTs (see the synopsis).  Disabling the FIFO should rarely be necessary.

       The  <u>flags</u>  keyword  <u>must</u> be used for all ports that are part of an IRQ sharing group.  One bit specifies
       IRQ sharing; another bit specifies whether the port does <u>not</u>  require  AST/4  compatible  initialization.
       The  minor number of the device corresponding a master port for the group is encoded as a bitfield in the
       high byte.  The same master port must be specified for all ports in a group.

       The <u>irq</u> specification must be given for master ports and for ports that are not part of  an  IRQ  sharing
       group, and not for other ports.

       In the synopsis, <u>flags</u> <u>0x701</u> means that the 8th port (sio7) is the master port, and that the port is on a
       multiport card with shared IRQs and an AST/4 compatible IRQ control register.

       <u>flags</u> <u>0xb05</u> means that the 12th port (sio11) is the master port, and that the port is on a multiport card
       with shared IRQs and no special IRQ control register.

       Which port is the master port depends on the card type.  Consult the hardware documentation of your card.
       Since  IRQ  status registers are never used, and IRQ control registers are only used for AST/4 compatible
       cards, and some cards map the control/status registers to all ports in a group, any port in a group  will
       sometimes  do  for  the  master  port.   Choose  a  port  containing  an IRQ status register for forwards
       compatibility, and the highest possible port for consistency.

       Serial ports controlled by the <b>sio</b> driver can be used for both `callin' and  `callout'.   For  each  port
       there is a callin device and a callout device.  The minor number of the callout device is 128 higher than
       that  of  the  corresponding  callin  port.   The callin device is general purpose.  Processes opening it
       normally wait for carrier and for the callout device to become inactive.  The callout device is  used  to
       steal the port from processes waiting for carrier on the callin device.  Processes opening it do not wait
       for  carrier  and  put any processes waiting for carrier on the callin device into a deeper sleep so that
       they do not conflict with the callout session.  The callout device is abused for handling  programs  that
       are  supposed to work on general ports and need to open the port without waiting but are too stupid to do
       so.

       The <b>sio</b> driver also supports an initial-state and a lock-state control device for each of the callin  and
       the  callout  "data"  devices.   The  termios  settings  of  a  data  device are copied from those of the
       corresponding initial-state device on first opens and are not inherited from previous opens.  Use <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1)
       in the normal way on the initial-state devices to program initial termios states suitable for your setup.

       The lock termios state acts as flags to disable changing  the  termios  state.   E.g.,  to  lock  a  flag
       variable  such  as CRTSCTS, use <u>stty</u> <u>crtscts</u> on the lock-state device.  Speeds and special characters may
       be locked by setting the corresponding value in the lock-state device to any  nonzero  value.   E.g.,  to
       lock  a  speed  to  115200,  use “<b>stty</b> <b>115200</b>” on the initial-state device and “<b>stty</b> <b>1</b>” on the lock-state
       device.

       Correct programs talking to correctly wired external devices work with almost  arbitrary  initial  states
       and  almost  no locking, but other setups may benefit from changing some of the default initial state and
       locking the state.  In particular, the initial states for non (POSIX) standard flags  should  be  set  to
       suit  the devices attached and may need to be locked to prevent buggy programs from changing them.  E.g.,
       CRTSCTS should be locked on for devices that support RTS/CTS handshaking at all times and off for devices
       that do not support it at all.  CLOCAL should be locked on for  devices  that  do  not  support  carrier.
       HUPCL  may  be  locked  off  if  you do not want to hang up for some reason.  In general, very bad things
       happen if something is locked to the wrong state, and things  should  not  be  locked  for  devices  that
       support  more than one setting.  The CLOCAL flag on callin ports should be locked off for logins to avoid
       certain security holes, but this needs to be done by getty if the callin port is used for anything else.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>sio</b> driver is derived from the HP9000/300 <u><a href="../man4/dca.4.html">dca</a></u>(4) driver and is currently under development.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Data  loss may occur at very high baud rates on slow systems, or with too many ports on any system, or on
       heavily loaded systems when crtscts cannot be used.  The use of NS16550A's reduces system load and  helps
       to avoid data loss.

       Stay  away  from  plain  NS16550's.  These are early implementations of the chip with non-functional FIFO
       hardware.

       The constants which define the locations of the various serial ports are holdovers from DOS.   As  shown,
       hex addresses can be and for clarity probably should be used instead.

       Note  that  on  the  AST/4 the card's dipswitches should <u>not</u> be set to use interrupt sharing.  AST/4-like
       interrupt sharing is only used when <u>multiple</u> AST/4 cards are installed  in  the  same  system.   The  <b>sio</b>
       driver does not support more than 1 AST/4 on one IRQ.

       The examples in the synopsis are too vendor-specific.
