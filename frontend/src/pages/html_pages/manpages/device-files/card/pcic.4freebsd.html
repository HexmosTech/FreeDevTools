       pcic — PC Card bridge driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>device</b> <b>pcic</b>
       <b>device</b> <b>pccard</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>pcic</b>  driver  provides  support  for  older  ISA and non-Yenta PCI PC Card bridges.  The <b>pcic</b> driver
       supports most ExCA devices attached to the ISA bus or PCI devices  that  do  not  conform  to  the  Yenta
       specification.

       The following ISA devices, or true clones, are supported in the current code.

       Intel i82365SL Step A
       Intel i82365SL Step B
       Intel i82365SL Step C  Intel's original 16-bit PC Card controller.
       Intel i82365SL-DF      Intel's last version of this device.  3.3V support was added.
       VLSI 82C146            An older VLSI part with some issues on some machines.
       Cirrus Logic PD-6710
       Cirrus Logic PD-6720
       Cirrus Logic PD-6722   Cirrus  Logic's  pcic  controller.   Compatible  with the i82365SL Step C with the
                              addition of a different 3.3V control.
       Ricoh RF5C296
       Ricoh RF5C396          Ricoh's PC Card bridge chips.  These are compatible with the i82365SL Step C,  but
                              with yet another different 3.3V control.
       Vadem 365
       Vadem 465              Compatible with i82365SL Step C.
       Vadem 468
       Vadem 469              Like  the  earlier  Vadem models, but with Vadem's own, incompatible, 3.3V control
                              system.
       IBM PCIC               IBM clone of the original i82365SL part, with its own ID register value.   Has  no
                              3.3V ability.

       Many  other  vendors  made  parts  in  this arena, but most of them were compatible with one of the above
       chipsets.

       The following PCI pcmcia bridges are supported:

       Cirrus Logic PD6729
       Cirrus Logic PD6730

       O2micro OZ6729
       O2micro OZ6730

       This does not work at all at the moment.
