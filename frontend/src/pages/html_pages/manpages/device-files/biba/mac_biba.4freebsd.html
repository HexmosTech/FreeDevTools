       mac_biba — Biba data integrity policy

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile Biba into your kernel, place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>options</b> <b>MAC</b>
             <b>options</b> <b>MAC_BIBA</b>

       Alternately,  to load the Biba module at boot time, place the following line in your kernel configuration
       file:

             <b>options</b> <b>MAC</b>

       and in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             mac_biba_load="YES"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>mac_biba</b> policy module implements the Biba integrity model, which protects the  integrity  of  system
       objects  and  subjects  by  means  of a strict information flow policy.  In Biba, all system subjects and
       objects are assigned integrity labels, made up  of  hierarchal  grades,  and  non-hierarchal  components.
       Together,  these  label elements permit all labels to be placed in a partial order, with information flow
       protections based on a dominance operator describing the order.  The hierarchal grade field is  expressed
       as  a  value  between  0  and  65535, with higher values reflecting higher integrity.  The non-hierarchal
       compartment field is expressed as a set of up to 256 components, numbered from  0  to  255.   A  complete
       label consists of both hierarchal and non-hierarchal elements.

       Three special label values exist:

             <b>Label</b>         <b>Comparison</b>
             <b>biba/low</b>      lower than all other labels
             <b>biba/equal</b>    equal to all other labels
             <b>biba/high</b>     higher than all other labels

       The  “<b>biba/high</b>” label is assigned to system objects which affect the integrity of the system as a whole.
       The “<b>biba/equal</b>” label may be used to indicate that a particular subject or object  is  exempt  from  the
       Biba  protections.  These special label values are not specified as containing any compartments, although
       in  a  label  comparison,  “<b>biba/high</b>”  appears  to  contain  all  compartments,  “<b>biba/equal</b>”  the  same
       compartments as the other label to which it is being compared, and “<b>biba/low</b>” none.

       In general, Biba access control takes the following model:

       <b>•</b>   A  subject  at  the  same  integrity level as an object may both read from and write to the object as
           though Biba protections were not in place.

       <b>•</b>   A subject at a higher integrity level than an object may write  to  the  object,  but  not  read  the
           object.

       <b>•</b>   A subject at a lower integrity level than an object may read the object, but not write to the object.

       <b>•</b>   If the subject and object labels may not be compared in the partial order, all access is restricted.

       These  rules  prevent  subjects  of  lower  integrity  from  influencing the behavior of higher integrity
       subjects by preventing the flow of information, and hence control, from allowing low  integrity  subjects
       to  modify  either  a  high  integrity  object  or high integrity subjects acting on those objects.  Biba
       integrity policies may be appropriate  in  a  number  of  environments,  both  from  the  perspective  of
       preventing  corruption of the operating system, and corruption of user data if marked as higher integrity
       than the attacker.  In traditional trusted operating systems, the Biba integrity model is used to protect
       the Trusted Code Base (TCB).

       The Biba integrity model is similar to <u><a href="../man4/mac_lomac.4.html">mac_lomac</a></u>(4), with the exception that LOMAC permits  access  by  a
       higher  integrity  subject to a lower integrity object, but downgrades the integrity level of the subject
       to prevent integrity rules from being violated.  Biba is a fixed label policy in  that  all  subject  and
       object label changes are explicit, whereas LOMAC is a floating label policy.

       The  Biba  integrity  model is also similar to <u><a href="../man4/mac_mls.4.html">mac_mls</a></u>(4), with the exception that the dominance operator
       and access rules are reversed, preventing the downward flow of information rather than the upward flow of
       information.  Multi-Level Security (MLS) protects the confidentiality,  rather  than  the  integrity,  of
       subjects and objects.

   <b>Label</b> <b>Format</b>
       Almost all system objects are tagged with an effective, active label element, reflecting the integrity of
       the object, or integrity of the data contained in the object.  In general, objects labels are represented
       in the following form:

             <b>biba/</b><u>grade</u>:<u>compartments</u>

       For example:

             biba/10:2+3+6
             biba/low

       Subject  labels  consist  of  three  label  elements:  an effective (active) label, as well as a range of
       available labels.  This range is represented using two ordered Biba label elements, and  when  set  on  a
       process, permits the process to change its active label to any label of greater or equal integrity to the
       low  end  of  the range, and lesser or equal integrity to the high end of the range.  In general, subject
       labels are represented in the following form:

             <b>biba/</b><u>effectivegrade</u>:<u>effectivecompartments</u>(<u>lograde</u>:<u>locompartments-</u>
             <u>higrade</u>:<u>hicompartments</u>)

       For example:

             biba/10:2+3+6(5:2+3-20:2+3+4+5+6)
             biba/high(low-high)

       Valid ranged labels must meet the following requirement regarding their elements:

             <u>rangehigh</u> ≥ <u>effective</u> ≥ <u>rangelow</u>

       One class of objects with ranges currently exists, the network interface.  In the  case  of  the  network
       interface,  the  effective  label  element  references  the  default  label for packets received over the
       interface, and the range represents the range of acceptable labels of packets to be transmitted over  the
       interface.

   <b>Runtime</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       The following <u><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></u>(8) MIBs are available for fine-tuning the enforcement of this MAC policy.

       <u>security.mac.biba.enabled</u>     Enables enforcement of the Biba integrity policy.  (Default: 1).

       <u>security.mac.biba.ptys_equal</u>  Label <u><a href="../man4/pty.4.html">pty</a></u>(4)s as “<b>biba/equal</b>” upon creation.  (Default: 0).

       <u>security.mac.biba.revocation_enabled</u>
                                     Revoke  access  to objects if the label is changed to dominate the subject.
                                     (Default: 0).
