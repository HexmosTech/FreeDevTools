</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       twconfig - <u>Tripwire</u> configuration file reference

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file stores system-specific information, including the location of <u>Tripwire</u> data files,
       and  the  settings  used to send email notification. The configuration file settings are generated during
       the installation process, but can be changed by the system administrator at any time.  The  configuration
       file is signed with the site key, and the site passphrase is required to edit the file.

       During  installation,  a  signed  <u>Tripwire</u> configuration file <u>tw.cfg</u> will be created in the <u>/etc/tripwire</u>
       directory, and a plain text copy of this configuration  file  <u>twcfg.txt</u>  will  be  created  in  the  same
       directory.

       The  configuration  file  is modified using the <b>twadmin</b> <b>--create-cfgfile</b> command.  With this command, the
       user can designate an existing plain text file as the current configuration file.  Using the current site
       key and passphrase, the new configuration file is cryptographically signed and saved with this command.

   <b>Components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>File</b>
       The <u>Tripwire</u> configuration file is structured as a list of keyword-value  pairs,  and  may  also  contain
       comments and variable definitions.  Any lines with "#" in the first column are treated as comments.

       The general syntax for variable definition is:
           <u>keyword</u>  =  <u>value</u>
       For example:
           ROOT = /usr/tripwire
           EDITOR = /usr/local/bin/jove

       Variable substitution on the right hand side is permitted using the syntax:
           $(  <u>varname</u>  )
       For example:
           DBFILE = $(ROOT)/db/$(HOSTNAME).twd

       Variable  names  are  case-sensitive,  and  may  contain  all  alphanumeric  characters, underscores, the
       characters "+-@:", and the period.  Two variables are predefined in the configuration file, and  may  not
       be  changed.   HOSTNAME  is  the  unqualified  hostname that <u>Tripwire</u> is running on, and DATE is a string
       representation of the date and time.

   <b>Required</b> <b>Variables</b>
       The following variables must be set in order for <u>Tripwire</u>  to  operate.   The  values  listed  below  are
       assigned during installation.
   <b>Other</b> <b>Variables</b>
       The following variables are not required to run <u>Tripwire</u>, but some of the program's functionality will be
       lost without them.  The values assigned during installation are listed.

       EDITOR Specifies  an  editor to be used in interactive modes.  If <u>EDITOR</u> is not defined, and no editor is
              specified on the command line, using interactive modes will cause an error.
              Initial value:  <u><a href="file:/bin/vi">/bin/vi</a></u>

       TEMPDIRECTORY
              This variable can be set to the location to which tripwire should write its  temporary  files.  By
              default  it  is <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>, which due to the default permissions can be very insecure. It is recommended
              that you use this configuration variable  to  provide  tripwire  with  a  secure  place  to  write
              temporary  files.  The  directory  used  should have its permissions set such that only the owning
              process can read/write to it, i.e. "chmod 700".
              Initial value: <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>

       GLOBALEMAIL
              This variable is set to a list of email addresses separated by either a comma ",",  or  semi-colon
              ";".  If  a  report  would  have  normally  been  sent  out,  it will also be send to this list of
              recipients.
              Initial value:  <u>none</u>

       LATEPROMPTING
              Prompt for passphrase as late as possible to minimize the amount of time that  the  passphrase  is
              stored  in memory.  If the value is <u>true</u> (case-sensitive), then late prompting is turned on.  With
              any other value, or if the variable is removed from the  configuration  file,  late  prompting  is
              turned off.
              Initial value:  <u>false</u>

       LOOSEDIRECTORYCHECKING
              When  a  file  is added or removed from a directory, <u>Tripwire</u> reports both the changes to the file
              itself, and the modification to the directory (size, num links, etc.).  This can create  redundant
              entries  in  <u>Tripwire</u> reports.  With loose directory checking, Tripwire will not check directories
              for any properties that would change when a file was  added  or  deleted.   This  includes:  size,
              number  of links, access time, change time, modification time, number of blocks, growing file, and
              all hashes.

              If the value for this variable is <u>true</u> (case-sensitive), then loose directory checking  is  turned
              on,  and  these  properties  will be ignored for all directories.  With any other value, or if the
              variable is removed from the configuration file, loose directory checking is turned  off.  Turning
              loose directory checking on is equivalent to appending the following propertymask to the rules for
              all directory inodes: -snacmblCMSH
              Initial value:  <u>false</u>

       SYSLOGREPORTING
              If  this  variable  is  set  to  <u>true</u>,  messages  are sent to the syslog for four events: database
              initialization, integrity check completions, database updates, and  policy  updates.   The  syslog
              messages  are  sent from the "user" facility at the "notice" level.  For more information, see the
              <b><a href="../man1/syslogd.1.html">syslogd</a></b>(1) man page and the <u>syslog.conf</u> file.  The following illustrates the information logged in
              the syslog for each of the four events:
/var/lib/tripwire/test.twd
/var/lib/tripwire/test.twd
/var/lib/tripwire/test.twd

              The letters in the Integrity Checking log correspond to # of violations, maximum  severity  level,
              and  #  of files added, deleted, and changed, respectively.  With any value other than <u>true</u>, or if
              this variable is removed from the configuration file, syslog reporting will be turned off.
              Initial value:  <u>true</u>

       REPORTLEVEL
              Specifies the default level of report produced by the <b>twprint</b> <b>--print-report</b>  mode.  Valid  values
              for  this  option are 0 to 4. The report level specified by this option can be overridden with the
              (<b>-t</b> or <b>--report-level</b>) option on the command line.  If  this  variable  is  not  included  in  the
              configuration  file,  the  default  report  level  is 3.  Note that only reports printed using the
              <b>twprint</b> <b>--print-report</b> mode are affected by this parameter; reports displayed by other  modes  and
              other commands are not affected.
              Initial value:  <u>3</u>

       DBPRINTLEVEL
              Specifies  the  default  level of report produced by the <b>twprint</b> <b>‐‐print‐dbfile</b> mode. Valid values
              for this option are 0 to 2. The output level specified by this option can be overridden  with  the
              (<b>‐t</b> or <b>‐‐output‐level</b>)  option  on  the  command  line.  If  this  variable is not included in the
              configuration file, the default output level is 2.
              Initial value:  <u>2</u>

       HASH_DIRECT_IO
              Use direct i/o when hashing files. (Linux-only as of OST 2.4.3.2)
              Initial value:  <u>false</u>

       RESOLVE_IDS_TO_NAMES
              Specifies whether to resolve uid/gid values to user &amp; group names.  Static binaries  may  segfault
              while calling getpwuid/getgrgid in certain nsswitch.conf configurations, and setting this to false
              will bypass the name resolution step and prevent the segfault.
              Initial value:  <u>true</u>

   <b>Email</b> <b>Notification</b> <b>Variables</b>
       MAILMETHOD
              Specifies  the  protocol to be used by <u>Tripwire</u> for email notification. The only acceptable values
              for this field are SMTP or SENDMAIL. Any other value will produce an error message.
              Initial value:  <u>SENDMAIL</u>

       SMTPHOST
              Specifies the domain name or IP address of the SMTP server used for  email  notification.  Ignored
              unless MAILMETHOD is set to SMTP.
              Initial value:  <u>mail.domain.com</u>

       SMTPPORT
              Specifies the port number used with SMTP. Ignored unless MAILMETHOD is set to SMTP.
              Initial value:  <u>25</u>

       MAILPROGRAM
              Specifies  the  program  used  for  email  reporting  of  rule  violations if MAILMETHOD is set to
              SENDMAIL.  The program must take an RFC822 style mail header, and recipients will be listed in the
              "To:" field of the mail header.  Some mail programs interpret a line consisting of only  a  single
              period character to mean end‐of‐input, and all text after that is ignored.  Since there is a small
              possibility  that  a <u>Tripwire</u> report would contain such a line, the mail program specified must be
              able to ignore lines that consist of a single period (the <b>-oi</b> option  to  sendmail  produces  this
              behavior).
              Initial value:  <u>/usr/lib/sendmail</u> <u>-oi</u> <u>-t</u>

       EMAILREPORTLEVEL
              Specifies  the  default level of report produced by the <b>tripwire</b> <b>--check</b> mode email report.  Valid
              values for this option are 0 to 4. The report level specified by this  option  can  be  overridden
              with the (<b>-t</b> or <b>--email-report-level</b>) option on the command‐line. If this variable is not included
              in the configuration file, the default report level is 3.
              Initial value:  <u>3</u>

       MAILNOVIOLATIONS
              This  option  controls  the  way  that <u>Tripwire</u> sends email notification if no rule violations are
              found during an integrity check.  If MAILNOVIOLATIONS is set to <u>false</u> and no violations are found,
              <u>Tripwire</u> will not send a report. With any other value, or if the  variable  is  removed  from  the
              configuration file, <u>Tripwire</u> will send an email message stating that no violations were found.

              Mailing  reports  of  no  violations  allows  an  administrator  to distinguish between unattended
              integrity checks that are failing to run and integrity checks that are running but are not finding
              any violations.  However, mailing no violations reports will increase the amount of data that must
              be processed.
              Initial value: <u>true</u>

       MAILFROMADDRESS
              Specifies the value of the "From:" field in email reports.
              Initial value:  <u>tripwire@hostname</u>, where 'hostname' is the local machine name.
