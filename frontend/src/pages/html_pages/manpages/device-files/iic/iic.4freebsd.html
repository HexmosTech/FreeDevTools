       iic — I2C generic I/O device driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>device</b> <b>iic</b>

       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;dev/iicbus/iic.h&gt;</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>iic</b>  device driver provides generic I/O to any <u><a href="../man4/iicbus.4.html">iicbus</a></u>(4) instance.  In order to control I2C devices,
       use <u>/dev/iic?</u> with the following ioctls:

       I2CSTART     (<u>struct</u> <u>iiccmd</u>) Sends the start condition to the slave specified by the <u>slave</u> element to the
                    bus.  The <u>slave</u> element consists of a 7-bit address and a read/write bit (that is,  a  7-bit
                    address  &lt;&lt;  1  |  r/w).  A read operation is initiated when the read/write bit is set, or a
                    write operation when it is cleared.  All other elements are  ignored.   If  successful,  the
                    file descriptor receives exclusive ownership of the underlying iicbus instance.

       I2CRPTSTART  (<u>struct</u>  <u>iiccmd</u>)  Sends  the  repeated  start  condition to the slave specified by the <u>slave</u>
                    element to the bus.  The slave address should  be  specified  as  in  I2CSTART.   All  other
                    elements  are  ignored.   I2CSTART  must  have  previously  been  issued  on  the  same file
                    descriptor.

       I2CSTOP      No argument is passed.  Sends the stop condition to the bus.   If  I2CSTART  was  previously
                    issued on the file descriptor, the current transaction is terminated and exclusive ownership
                    of the underlying iicbus instance is released.  Otherwise, no action is performed.

       I2CRSTCARD   (<u>struct</u>  <u>iiccmd</u>) Resets the bus.  The argument is completely ignored.  This command does not
                    require I2CSTART to have  been  previously  issued  on  the  file  descriptor.   If  it  was
                    previously issued, exclusive ownership of the underlying iicbus instance is released.

       I2CWRITE     (<u>struct</u> <u>iiccmd</u>) Writes data to the <u><a href="../man4/iicbus.4.html">iicbus</a></u>(4).  The bus must already be started by a previous
                    I2CSTART  on  the  file descriptor.  The <u>slave</u> element is ignored.  The <u>count</u> element is the
                    number of bytes to write.  The <u>last</u> element is  a  boolean  flag.   It  must  be  zero  when
                    additional  read  commands  will  follow,  or non-zero if this is the last command.  The <u>buf</u>
                    element is a pointer to the data to write to the bus.

       I2CREAD      (<u>struct</u> <u>iiccmd</u>) Reads data from the <u><a href="../man4/iicbus.4.html">iicbus</a></u>(4).   The  bus  must  already  be  started  by  a
                    previous  I2CSTART on the file descriptor.  The <u>slave</u> element is ignored.  The <u>count</u> element
                    is the number of bytes to read.  The <u>last</u> element is a boolean flag.  It must be  zero  when
                    additional  read  commands  will  follow,  or non-zero if this is the last command.  The <u>buf</u>
                    element is a pointer to where to store the data read from the bus.  Short reads on  the  bus
                    produce undefined results.

       I2CRDWR      (<u>struct</u>  <u>iic_rdwr_data</u>)  Generic  read/write  interface.   Allows for an arbitrary number of
                    commands to be sent to an arbitrary number of devices on the bus.  Any previous  transaction
                    started by I2CSTART must be terminated by I2CSTOP or I2CRSTCARD before I2CRDWR can be issued
                    on  the  same  file  descriptor.   A read transfer is specified if IIC_M_RD is set in <u>flags</u>.
                    Otherwise the transfer is a write transfer.  The <u>slave</u> element specifies the  7-bit  address
                    with  the read/write bit for the transfer.  The read/write bit will be handled by the iicbus
                    stack based on the specified transfer operation.  The <u>len</u> element is the number  of  (<u>struct</u>
                    <u>iic_msg</u>)  messages  encoded on (<u>struct</u> <u>iic_rdwr_data</u>).  The <u>buf</u> element is a buffer for that
                    data.  This ioctl is intended to be Linux compatible.

       I2CSADDR     (<u>uint8_t</u>) Associate the specified address with the file descriptor  for  use  by  subsequent
                    <u><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></u>(2)  or  <u><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></u>(2)  calls.  The argument is an 8-bit address (that is, a 7-bit address &lt;&lt;
                    1).  The read/write bit in the least-significant position is ignored.  Any  subsequent  read
                    or write operation will set or clear that bit as needed.

       The following data structures are defined in &lt;<u>dev/iicbus/iic.h</u>&gt; and referenced above:

             struct iiccmd {
                     u_char slave;
                     int count;
                     int last;
                     char *buf;
             };

             /* Designed to be compatible with linux's struct i2c_msg */
             struct iic_msg
             {
                     uint16_t        slave;
                     uint16_t        flags;
             #define IIC_M_WR        0       /* Fake flag for write */
             #define IIC_M_RD        0x0001  /* read vs write */
             #define IIC_M_NOSTOP    0x0002  /* do not send a I2C stop after message */
             #define IIC_M_NOSTART   0x0004  /* do not send a I2C start before message */
                     uint16_t        len;    /* msg length */
                     uint8_t *       buf;
             };

             struct iic_rdwr_data {
                     struct iic_msg *msgs;
                     uint32_t nmsgs;
             };

       It  is also possible to use <u><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></u>(2) or <u><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></u>(2), in which case the I2C start/stop handshake is managed by
       <u><a href="../man4/iicbus.4.html">iicbus</a></u>(4).  The address used for the read/write operation is the one passed to the most  recent  I2CSTART
       <u><a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</a></u>(2)  or I2CSADDR <u><a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</a></u>(2) on the open <u>/dev/iic?</u> file descriptor.  Closing the file descriptor clears
       any addressing state established by a previous I2CSTART or I2CSADDR, stops any transaction established by
       a not-yet-terminated I2CSTART, and releases iicbus ownership.  Because addressing state is  stored  on  a
       per-file-descriptor  basis,  it is permissible for multiple file descriptors to be simultaneously open on
       the same <u>/dev/iic?</u> device.   Concurrent  transactions  on  those  descriptors  are  synchronized  by  the
       exclusive-ownership requests issued to the underlying iicbus instance.
