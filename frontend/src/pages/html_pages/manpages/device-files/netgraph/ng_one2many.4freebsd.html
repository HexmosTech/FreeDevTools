</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ng_one2many — packet multiplexing netgraph node type

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</b>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;netgraph/ng_one2many.h&gt;</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>one2many</b> provides a simple mechanism for routing packets over several links in a one-to-many (and in
       the reverse direction, many-to-one) fashion.  There is a single hook named one, and multiple hooks  named
       many0,  many1,  etc.   Packets received on any of the many hooks are forwarded out the one hook.  Packets
       received on the one hook are forwarded out one or more of the many hooks; which hook(s) is determined  by
       the node's configured transmit algorithm.  Packets are not altered in any way.

       Each  of  the connected many links may be considered to be up or down.  Packets are never delivered out a
       many hook that is down.  How a link is determined to be up or down depends on the node's configured  link
       failure detection algorithm.

       Before  an  interface or link can be plumbed into a group, its status must be marked as being “up”.  This
       is normally setup during the initial boot stages by  <u><a href="../man5/rc.conf.5.html">rc.conf</a></u>(5).   It  is  also  possible  to  change  an
       interface's status to “up” by using the <u><a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a></u>(8) utility.

</pre><h4><b>TRANSMIT</b> <b>ALGORITHMS</b></h4><pre>
       NG_ONE2MANY_XMIT_ROUNDROBIN
            Packets  are  delivered out the many hooks in sequential order.  Each packet goes out on a different
            many hook.

       NG_ONE2MANY_XMIT_ALL
            Packets are delivered out all the many hooks.  Each packet goes out each many hook.

       NG_ONE2MANY_XMIT_FAILOVER
            Packets are delivered out the first active many hook.

       In the future other algorithms may be added as well.

</pre><h4><b>LINK</b> <b>FAILURE</b> <b>DETECTION</b></h4><pre>
       The node distinguishes between active and failed  links.   Data  is  sent  only  to  active  links.   The
       following link failure detection algorithms are available:

       NG_ONE2MANY_FAIL_MANUAL
            The  node  is  explicitly  told  which  of  the links are up via the NGM_ONE2MANY_SET_CONFIG control
            message (see below).  Newly connected links are down until configured otherwise.

       NG_ONE2MANY_FAIL_NOTIFY
            The  node  listens  to  flow  control  message  from  <u>many</u>  hooks,  and  considers  link  failed  if
            NGM_LINK_IS_DOWN  is  received.   If  the  NGM_LINK_IS_UP  message  is received, node considers link
            active.

       In the future other algorithms may be added as well.

       When all links are considered failed, node sends the NGM_LINK_IS_DOWN message towards the <u>one</u> hook.  When
       at least one link comes up, node sends the NGM_LINK_IS_UP message towards the <u>one</u> hook.

</pre><h4><b>HOOKS</b></h4><pre>
       This node type supports up to NG_ONE2MANY_MAX_LINKS hooks named many0, many1, etc., plus  a  single  hook
       named one.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROL</b> <b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       This node type supports the generic control messages, plus the following:

       NGM_ONE2MANY_SET_CONFIG (<b>setconfig</b>)
            Sets the node configuration using a struct ng_one2many_link_config as the control message argument:

            /* Node configuration structure */
            struct ng_one2many_config {
              uint32_t    xmitAlg;        /* how to distribute packets */
              uint32_t    failAlg;        /* how to detect link failure */
              u_char      enabledLinks[NG_ONE2MANY_MAX_LINKS];
            };

            Currently,  the  valid  settings  for the xmitAlg field are NG_ONE2MANY_XMIT_ROUNDROBIN (default) or
            NG_ONE2MANY_XMIT_ALL.  The valid settings  for  failAlg  are  NG_ONE2MANY_FAIL_MANUAL  (default)  or
            NG_ONE2MANY_FAIL_NOTIFY.

       NGM_ONE2MANY_GET_CONFIG (<b>getconfig</b>)
            Returns the current node configuration in a struct ng_one2many_link_config.

       NGM_ONE2MANY_GET_STATS (<b>getstats</b>)
            This  command  takes a 32 bit link number as an argument and returns a struct ng_one2many_link_stats
            containing statistics for the corresponding many link, which may or may not be currently connected:

            /* Statistics structure (one for each link) */
            struct ng_one2many_link_stats {
              uint64_t   recvOctets;     /* total octets rec'd on link */
              uint64_t   recvPackets;    /* total pkts rec'd on link */
              uint64_t   xmitOctets;     /* total octets xmit'd on link */
              uint64_t   xmitPackets;    /* total pkts xmit'd on link */
              uint64_t   memoryFailures; /* times couldn't get mem or mbuf */
            };

            To access statistics for the one link, use the link number -1.

       NGM_ONE2MANY_CLR_STATS (<b>clrstats</b>)
            This command takes a 32 bit link number as an argument and clears the statistics for that link.

       NGM_ONE2MANY_GETCLR_STATS (<b>getclrstats</b>)
            Same as NGM_ONE2MANY_GET_STATS, but also atomically clears the statistics for the link as well.

</pre><h4><b>SHUTDOWN</b></h4><pre>
       This node shuts down upon receipt of a  NGM_SHUTDOWN  control  message,  or  when  all  hooks  have  been
       disconnected.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  commands  will  set  up  Ethernet interfaces fxp0 to deliver packets alternating over the
       physical interfaces corresponding to networking interfaces fxp0 through fxp3:

         # Plumb nodes together

         ngctl mkpeer fxp0: one2many upper one
         ngctl connect fxp0: fxp0:upper lower many0
         ngctl connect fxp1: fxp0:upper lower many1
         ngctl connect fxp2: fxp0:upper lower many2
         ngctl connect fxp3: fxp0:upper lower many3

         # Allow fxp1 through fxp3 to xmit/recv fxp0 frames

         ngctl msg fxp1: setpromisc 1
         ngctl msg fxp2: setpromisc 1
         ngctl msg fxp3: setpromisc 1
         ngctl msg fxp1: setautosrc 0
         ngctl msg fxp2: setautosrc 0
         ngctl msg fxp3: setautosrc 0

         # Configure all four links as up

         ngctl msg fxp0:upper \
           setconfig "{ xmitAlg=1 failAlg=1 enabledLinks=[ 1 1 1 1 ] }"

         # Bring up interface

         ifconfig fxp0 192.168.1.1 netmask 0xfffffffc

       With a similar setup on a peer  machine  (using  the  address  192.168.1.2),  a  point-to-point  Ethernet
       connection with four times normal bandwidth is achieved.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ng_one2many</b> node type was implemented in FreeBSD 4.2.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>one2many</b> netgraph node (with round-robin algorithm) was written by Archie Cobbs &lt;<u><a href="mailto:archie@FreeBSD.org">archie@FreeBSD.org</a></u>&gt;.
       The all algorithm was added by Rogier R. Mulhuijzen &lt;<u><a href="mailto:drwilco@drwilco.net">drwilco@drwilco.net</a></u>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       More transmit and link failure algorithms should be supported.  A good candidate is Cisco's Etherchannel.
