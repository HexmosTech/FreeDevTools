       atf-test-case — generic description of test cases

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  <u>test</u>  <u>case</u>  is  a piece of code that stress-tests a specific feature of the software.  This feature is
       typically self-contained enough, either in the amount of code that implements it or in the  general  idea
       that describes it, to warrant its independent testing.  Given this, test cases are very fine-grained, but
       they attempt to group similar smaller tests which are semantically related.

       A  test  case is defined by three components regardless of the language it is implemented in: a header, a
       body and a cleanup routine.  The <u>header</u> is, basically, a declarative piece of code that  defines  several
       properties  to  describe what the test case does and how it behaves.  In other words: it defines the test
       case's <u>meta-data</u>, further described in the “Meta-data” section.  The <u>body</u> is the test  case  itself.   It
       executes  all  actions needed to reproduce the test, and checks for failures.  This body is only executed
       if the abstract conditions specified by the header are met.  The <u>cleanup</u>  routine  is  a  piece  of  code
       always  executed  after the body, regardless of the exit status of the test case.  It can be used to undo
       side-effects of the test case.  Note that almost all  side-effects  of  a  test  case  are  automatically
       cleaned up by the library; this is explained in more detail in the rest of this document.

       It  is  extremely  important  to  keep the separation between a test case's header and body well-defined,
       because the header is <u>always</u> parsed, whereas the body is only executed when the conditions defined in the
       header are met and when the user specifies that test case.

       At last, test cases are always contained into test programs.  The test programs act  as  a  front-end  to
       them, providing a consistent interface to the user and several APIs to ease their implementation.

   <b>Results</b>
       Upon  termination, a test case reports a status and, optionally, a textual reason describing why the test
       reported such status.  The caller must ensure that the test case  really  performed  the  task  that  its
       status  describes,  as  the  test program may be bogus and therefore providing a misleading result, e.g.,
       providing a result that indicates success but the error code of the program says otherwise.

       The possible exit status of a test case are one of the following:

       expected_death      The test case expects to terminate abruptly.

       expected_exit       The test case expects to exit cleanly.

       expected_failure    The test case expects to exit with a controller  fatal/non-fatal  failure.   If  this
                           happens, the test program exits with a success error code.

       expected_signal     The test case expects to receive a signal that makes it terminate.

       expected_timeout    The test case expects to execute for longer than its timeout.

       passed              The test case was executed successfully.  The test program exits with a success error
                           code.

       skipped             The test case could not be executed because some preconditions were not met.  This is
                           not  a  failure  because it can typically be resolved by adjusting the system to meet
                           the necessary conditions.   This  is  always  accompanied  by  a  <u>reason</u>,  a  message
                           describing  why  the  test  was skipped.  The test program exits with a success error
                           code.

       failed              An error appeared during the execution of the test case.  This is always  accompanied
                           by a <u>reason</u>, a message describing why the test failed.  The test program exits with a
                           failure error code.

       The  usefulness  of  the  ‘expected_*’  results  comes when writing test cases that verify known failures
       caused, in general, due to programming errors  (aka  bugs).   Whenever  the  faulty  condition  that  the
       ‘expected_*’  result is trying to cover is fixed, then the test case will be reported as ‘failed’ and the
       developer will have to adjust it to match its new condition.

       It is important to note that all ‘expected_*’ results are only provided as a  <u>hint</u>  to  the  caller;  the
       caller must verify that the test case did actually terminate as the expected condition says.

   <b>Input/output</b>
       Test  cases are free to print whatever they want to their <u><a href="../man4/stdout.4.html">stdout</a></u>(4) and <u><a href="../man4/stderr.4.html">stderr</a></u>(4) file descriptors.  They
       are, in fact, encouraged to print status information as they execute to keep the user informed  of  their
       actions.  This is specially important for long test cases.

       Test  cases will log their results to an auxiliary file, which is then collected by the test program they
       are contained in.  The developer need not care about this  as  long  as  he  uses  the  correct  APIs  to
       implement the test cases.

       The standard input of the test cases is unconditionally connected to ‘/dev/zero’.

   <b>Meta-data</b>
       The  following  list  describes  all meta-data properties interpreted internally by ATF.  You are free to
       define new properties in your test cases and use them as you wish, but non-standard  properties  must  be
       prefixed by ‘X-’.

       descr              Type: textual.  Required.

                          A  brief textual description of the test case's purpose.  Will be shown to the user in
                          reports.  Also good for documentation purposes.

       has.cleanup        Type: boolean.  Optional.

                          If set to true, specifies that the test case has a cleanup  routine  that  has  to  be
                          executed  by  the  runtime  engine  during  the  cleanup phase of the execution.  This
                          property is automatically set by the framework  when  defining  a  test  case  with  a
                          cleanup routine, so it should never be set by hand.

       ident              Type: textual.  Required.

                          The  test  case's  identifier.   Must  be unique inside the test program and should be
                          short but descriptive.

       require.arch       Type: textual.  Optional.

                          A whitespace separated list of architectures that the  test  case  can  be  run  under
                          without causing errors due to an architecture mismatch.

       require.config     Type: textual.  Optional.

                          A whitespace separated list of configuration variables that must be defined to execute
                          the  test  case.   If  any  of the required variables is not defined, the test case is
                          <u>skipped</u>.

       require.diskspace  Type: integer.  Optional.  Specifies the minimum amount of available disk space needed
                          by the test.  The value can have a size suffix such as ‘K’, ‘M’, ‘G’ or  ‘T’  to  make
                          the amount of bytes easier to type and read.

       require.files      Type: textual.  Optional.

                          A  whitespace  separated  list of files that must be present to execute the test case.
                          The names of these files must be absolute paths.  If any of the required files is  not
                          found, the test case is <u>skipped</u>.

       require.machine    Type: textual.  Optional.

                          A  whitespace  separated  list  of  machine  types that the test case can be run under
                          without causing errors due to a machine type mismatch.

       require.memory     Type: integer.  Optional.  Specifies the minimum amount of physical memory  needed  by
                          the  test.   The value can have a size suffix such as ‘K’, ‘M’, ‘G’ or ‘T’ to make the
                          amount of bytes easier to type and read.

       require.progs      Type: textual.  Optional.

                          A whitespace separated list of programs that must be present to execute the test case.
                          These can be given as plain names, in which case they are looked in the  user's  PATH,
                          or  as absolute paths.  If any of the required programs is not found, the test case is
                          <u>skipped</u>.

       require.user       Type: textual.  Optional.

                          The required  privileges  to  execute  the  test  case.   Can  be  one  of  ‘root’  or
                          ‘unprivileged’.

                          If  the  test  case is running as a regular user and this property is ‘root’, the test
                          case is <u>skipped</u>.

                          If the test case is running as root and this property is ‘unprivileged’,  the  runtime
                          engine will automatically drop the privileges if the ‘unprivileged-user’ configuration
                          property is set; otherwise the test case is <u>skipped</u>.

       timeout            Type: integral.  Optional; defaults to ‘300’.

                          Specifies  the  maximum  amount  of  time the test case can run.  This is particularly
                          useful because some tests can stall either  because  they  are  incorrectly  coded  or
                          because  they  trigger an anomalous behavior of the program.  It is not acceptable for
                          these tests to stall the whole execution of the test program.

                          Can optionally be set to zero, in which case the test  case  has  no  run-time  limit.
                          This is discouraged.

   <b>Environment</b>
       Every  time  a test case is executed, several environment variables are cleared or reseted to sane values
       to ensure they do not make the test fail due to unexpected conditions.  These variables are:

       HOME           Set to the work directory's path.

       LANG           Undefined.

       LC_ALL         Undefined.

       LC_COLLATE     Undefined.

       LC_CTYPE       Undefined.

       LC_MESSAGES    Undefined.

       LC_MONETARY    Undefined.

       LC_NUMERIC     Undefined.

       LC_TIME        Undefined.

       TZ             Hardcoded to ‘UTC’.

   <b>Work</b> <b>directories</b>
       The test program always creates a temporary directory and switches to it before running the  test  case's
       body.   This  way  the  test  case  is free to modify its current directory as it wishes, and the runtime
       engine will be able to clean it up later on in a safe way, removing any traces of its execution from  the
       system.   To  do  so,  the  runtime engine will perform a recursive removal of the work directory without
       crossing mount points; if a mount point is found, the file system will be unmounted (if possible).

   <b>File</b> <b>creation</b> <b>mode</b> <b>mask</b> <b>(umask)</b>
       Test cases are always executed with a file creation mode mask (umask) of ‘0022’.  The test case's code is
       free to change this during execution.
