</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wacom</b> is an X input driver for Wacom devices.

       The <b>wacom</b> driver functions as a pointer input device.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       This  driver  supports  the  Wacom  IV  and Wacom V protocols. Serial tablets only need this driver.  USB
       tablet support is available on some Linux platforms and requires the wacom  kernel  driver  being  loaded
       before this driver starts.

       Please check https://github.com/linuxwacom for latest updates of Wacom X and kernel drivers.

</pre><h4><b>DRIVER-INTERNAL</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>HOTPLUGGING</b></h4><pre>
       When  input  device  hotplugging  in  the  X  server  is  enabled and no <b>InputDevice</b> section exists for a
       compatible tablet device and an <b>InputClass</b> section (see <a href="../man5x/xorg.conf.d.5x.html">xorg.conf.d</a>(5x))  assigns  this  driver  for  the
       device,  the  <b>wacom</b>  driver  creates multiple X devices for each a physical device, one X device for each
       available tool. The list of tools is hardware-dependent. See <b>Option</b> <b>Type</b> as outlined in the <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       <b>DETAILS</b> section.

       These tool-specific devices are referred to as parent device and dependent device.  The parent device  is
       the  one  presented  by  the  system  and the one that causes the X server to load the <b>wacom</b> driver. This
       parent device then causes the automatic addition of several dependent devices. If the  parent  device  is
       unplugged or otherwise removed, the dependent devices will be automatically removed as well.

       Dependent  devices  may  be  assigned  tool-specific  options  through additional <b>InputClass</b> sections. We
       recommend that a <b>MatchDriver</b> <b>wacom</b> line is used in  these  sections  in  addition  to  the  user-specific
       pattern.

       Match  directives are applied by the X server before the driver is selected.  The type name of the parent
       device is appended by the driver. It is not possible to use a <b>MatchProduct</b>  directive  to  match  against
       this appended type name.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       Please  refer  to <a href="../man5x/xorg.conf.5x.html">xorg.conf</a>(5x) or <a href="../man5x/xorg.conf.d.5x.html">xorg.conf.d</a>(5x) for general configuration details and for options that
       can be used with all input drivers.  This section only covers  configuration  details  specific  to  this
       driver.

       Multiple instances of the Wacom devices can cohabit. Each device supports the following entries:

               <b>Option</b> <u>"Type"</u> <u>"stylus"|"eraser"|"cursor"|"pad"|"touch"</u>
                   sets  the  type  of  tool the device represents. This option is mandatory.  The core options,
                   such as "SendCoreEvents" or "AlwaysCore", are unnecessary in Gimp if you don't need  to  move
                   system  cursor  outside  of  Gimp  drawing area.  "pad" is for Intuos 3 or Cintiq 21UX tablet
                   ExpressKeys/menu strips, and Graphire 4 or Bamboo tablet buttons, wheel, and/or ring.  It  is
                   required   for  Intuos3,   CintiqV5,  Graphire  4,  and  Bamboo  if you want to use keystroke
                   features.  "pad" is reported as a second tool in the driver. "touch" is for the  tablet  with
                   touch support.  Right now only a few Tablet PCs have this feature.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"Device"</u> <u>"path"</u>
                   sets  the  path to the special file which represents serial line where the tablet is plugged.
                   You have to specify it for each subsection with the same value if you want to  have  multiple
                   devices with the same tablet.  This option is mandatory.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"Suppress"</u> <u>"number"</u>
                   sets  the  position  increment  under  which not to transmit coordinates.  This entry must be
                   specified only in the first Wacom subsection if you have multiple devices for one tablet.  If
                   you  don't  specify  this  entry,  the  default  value,  which is 2, will be used. To disable
                   suppression, the entry should be specified as 0.  When suppress is defined,  an event will be
                   sent only when at least one of the following conditions is met:

                           the change between the current X coordinate and the  previous  one  is  greater  than
                   suppress;

                           the  change  between  the  current  Y coordinate and the previous one is greater than
                   suppress;

                           the change between the  current  pressure  and  the  previous  one  is  greater  than
                   suppress;

                           the  change  between  the   current  degree  of  rotation and the previous one of the
                   transducer is greater than suppress;

                           the change between the current absolute wheel value and the previous one is equal  to
                   or greater than suppress;

                           the change between the current tilt value and the previous one is equal to or greater
                   than suppress (if tilt is supported);

                           relative wheel value has changed;

                           button value has changed;

                           proximity has changed.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"Mode"</u> <u>"Relative"|"Absolute"</u>
                   sets  the  mode  of  the  device.   The default value for stylus, pad and eraser is Absolute;
                   cursor is Relative; touch defaults to Relative for tablets with touch pads and  Absolute  for
                   touch screens.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"TopX"</u> <u>"number"</u>
                   X coordinate of the top corner of the active zone.  Default to 0.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"TopY"</u> <u>"number"</u>
                   Y coordinate of the top corner of the active zone.  Default to 0.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"BottomX"</u> <u>"number"</u>
                   X coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone.  Default to width of the tablet.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"BottomY"</u> <u>"number"</u>
                   Y coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone.  Default to height of the tablet.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"ButtonsOnly"</u> <u>"on"|"off"</u>
                   disables the device's motion events.  Default to off.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"ButtonM"</u> <u>"AC"</u>
                   reports  an  action  AC  when  button  M  is pressed,  where M is one of the device supported
                   button numbers,  it can be 1 to 32. Wacom uses a driver-internal button  mapping,  where  any
                   physical  button  appears  to  the  X  server as the button specified by the ButtonM mapping.
                   Hence, if two physical buttons have the same ButtonM mapping, the server will think they  are
                   the  same  physical  button.   The  default action reported to the X server is mouse button M
                   click. Because X uses buttons 4, 5, 6, and 7  as  the  four  scrolling  directions,  physical
                   buttons  4  and higher are mapped to 8 and higher by default.  Only simple button presses can
                   be configured here; for more complex actions, use <a href="../man1/xsetwacom.1.html">xsetwacom</a>(1).  To ignore the button  click,
                   i.e., to not report any button click event to the X server,  use "0" or "button 0".

               <b>Option</b> <u>"TPCButton"</u> <u>"on"|"off"</u>
                   enables the stylus buttons as Tablet PC buttons. If enabled, the stylus reports button events
                   only  when its tip is pressed. If any button is down, pressing the tip reports a button event
                   for the button. Otherwise if no button is down, the tip reports as usual.   Default  to  "on"
                   for Tablet PCs; "off" for all other models. Only available on the stylus tool.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"Touch"</u> <u>"on"|"off"</u>
                   enables  touch  events  for  touch  devices,  i.e., system cursor moves when user touches the
                   tablet.  Default to "on" for devices that support touch; "off" for all other models.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"Rotate"</u> <u>"CW"|"CCW"|"HALF"|"NONE"</u>
                   rotates the tablet orientation counterclockwise  (CCW)  or  clockwise  (CW)  or  180  degrees
                   (HALF).  If you have specific tablet mappings, i.e. TopX/Y or BottomX/Y were set, the mapping
                   will  be  applied before rotation. Rotation must be applied to the parent device (usually the
                   stylus), rotation settings  on  in-driver  hotplugged  devices  (see  <b>DRIVER-INTERNAL</b>  <b>DEVICE</b>
                   <b>HOTPLUGGING</b> ) will be ignored. The default is "NONE".

               <b>Option</b> <u>"PressCurve"</u> <u>"x1,y1,x2,y2"</u>
                   sets  pressure  curve  by  control points x1, y1, x2, and y2.  Their values are in range from
                   0..100. The pressure curve is interpreted as Bezier curve with 4 control  points,  the  first
                   and  the last control point being fixed on the coordinates 0/0 and 100/100, respectively. The
                   middle control points are adjustible by this setting and thus define the shape of the  curve.
                   The  input  for  linear  curve  (default) is "0,0,100,100"; slightly depressed curve (firmer)
                   might be "5,0,100,95"; slightly raised curve (softer) might be  "0,5,95,100".   The  pressure
                   curve is only applicable to devices of type stylus or eraser, other devices do not honor this
                   setting.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"Pressure2K"</u> <u>"bool"</u>
                   reduces  the  pressure  range  to  the  range  of  0 to 2048 for backwards compatibility with
                   applications that have this range hardcoded.  See section <b>BUGS.</b>  This option  should  not  be
                   used unless the user runs one or more applications that rely on a hardcoded pressure range.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"DebugLevel"</u> <u>"number"</u>
                   sets  the level of debugging info for tool-specific messages.  There are 12 levels, specified
                   by the integers between 1 and 12.  All debug messages with a level less than or equal to  the
                   "number"  will  be logged into the Xorg log file. This option is only available if the driver
                   was built with debugging support.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"CommonDBG"</u> <u>"number"</u>
                   sets the level of debugging info for common  (i.e.  not  tool-specific)  code  paths  on  the
                   tablet.  There  are 12 levels, specified by the integers between 1 and 12. All debug messages
                   with a level less than or equal to the "number" will be logged into the Xorg log  file.  This
                   option is only available if the driver was built with debugging support.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"GrabDevice"</u> <u>"bool"</u>
                   sets  whether  the  underlying event device will be grabbed by the driver to prevent the data
                   from leaking to /dev/input/mice. When enabled, while  the  X  server  is  running,  no  other
                   programs will be able to read the event stream.  Default: "false".

               <b>Option</b> <u>"CursorProx"</u> <u>"number"</u>
                   sets the distance at which a relative tool is treated as being out of proximity.  Beyond this
                   distance  the  cursor  will stop responding to tool motion. The default value for pucks is 10
                   (Intuos Pro) or 42 (Intuos/Bamboo). The default value for pens is 30.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"RawSample"</u> <u>"number"</u>
                   Set  the  sample  window  size (a sliding average sampling window) for  incoming  input  tool
                   raw data points.  Default:  4, range of 1 to 20.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"Serial"</u> <u>"number"</u>
                   sets  the  serial  number  associated  with the physical device. This allows to have multiple
                   devices of the same type (i.e. multiple pens). This option  is  only  available  on  wacom  V
                   devices  (Intuos series and Cintiq 21U).  To see which serial number belongs to a device, you
                   need to run the utility program, xsetwacom, which comes with linuxwacom package.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"ToolSerials"</u> <u>"number[,type[,label]][;...]"</u>
                   sets the list of serial numbered devices that need to be hotplugged for  a  physical  device.
                   The  'type'  option  may  be any of "pen", "airbrush", "artpen", or "cursor".  This option is
                   only available on wacom V devices which are capable of reporting a serial number. To see if a
                   connected device is supported, or to identify which serial number belongs to  a  device,  you
                   need  to  run the utility program, xsetwacom, that comes with this driver. In layman's terms,
                   this option will add additional X devices for  this  specific  tool's  tip  (and  eraser,  if
                   applicable).   This  is  useful  for programs like gimp (which remembers tools based on the X
                   device) to recall additional drawing tool selections for an airbrush+eraser, art  pen,  extra
                   pen, etc.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"Threshold"</u> <u>"number"</u>
                   sets  the  pressure  threshold  used  to generate a button 1 events of stylus.  The threshold
                   applies to the normalised pressure range of [0..2048].  The default is 27.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"Gesture"</u> <u>"bool"</u>
                   Enable or disable multi-finger in-driver gesture support on the device. Default:  off  unless
                   the  tablet  supports  multi-touch.  Note  that  disabling  this option may allow the desktop
                   environment to detect multi-finger gestures instead.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"ZoomDistance"</u> <u>"number"</u>
                   If <b>Option</b> <u>"Gesture"</u> is enabled, this option specifies the minimum movement distance before  a
                   zoom gesture is recognized.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"ScrollDistance"</u> <u>"number"</u>
                   If  <b>Option</b> <u>"Gesture"</u> is enabled, this option specifies the minimum movement distance before a
                   scroll gesture is recognized.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"TapTime"</u> <u>"number"</u>
                   If <b>Option</b> <u>"Gesture"</u> is enabled, this option determines the maximum time of a touch  event  to
                   be  recognized  as tap. A press and release event shorter than <b>TapTime</b> generates button press
                   and release events. Presses longer than <b>TapTime</b> do not generate button  events,  only  motion
                   events.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"PressureRecalibration"</u> <u>"bool"</u>
                   Allows to disable pressure recalibration. Default: true.  If the initial pressure of a device
                   is  != 0 the driver recalibrates the pressure range. This is to account for worn out devices.
                   The downside is that when the user hits the tablet very hard the initial pressure reading may
                   be unequal to zero even for a perfectly good pen. If the consecutive  pressure  readings  are
                   not  higher than the initial pressure by a threshold no button event will be generated.  This
                   option allows to disable the recalibration.

               <b>Option</b> <u>"PanScrollThreshold"</u> <u>"number"</u>
                   Specifies the distance the pen must move (in tablet units) before a scroll event is generated
                   when using the "pan" action. Smaller values will require less distance and be more sensitive.
                   Larger values will require more distance and  be  less  sensitive.   Default:  1300  or  2600
                   depending on tablet resolution (corresponds to 13 mm of distance).

</pre><h4><b>TOUCH</b> <b>GESTURES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Single</b> <b>finger</b> <b>(1FG)</b>
       <b>Left</b> <b>click:</b> tap, actual click happens after TapTime period elapses.

       <b>Left</b>  <b>click</b>  <b>drag:</b>  tap  to  select,  quickly  (within TapTime period) touch selection again.  Then drag.
       Available on touchpads, e.g. BambooPT, not touchscreens.

   <b>Two</b> <b>finger</b> <b>(2FG)</b>
       <b>Right</b> <b>click:</b> one finger down + tap second finger

       <b>Vertical</b> <b>scroll:</b> two fingers side by side (in any orientation) moving vertically with constant separation
       initiates a vertical scroll.  By driver default a gesture up results in a scroll down event (the document
       moves up) and a gesture down results in a scroll up event (moving the document down).

       <b>Horizontal</b> <b>scroll:</b> two fingers side by side held at a constant distance moving horizontally  initiates  a
       horizontal scroll.  A gesture to the left results in a scroll right event (the document moves left) and a
       gesture right results in a scroll left event (moving the document right).

       <b>Zoom</b> <b>in:</b> two separated fingers side by side, bring together i.e. pinch.

       <b>Zoom</b> <b>out:</b> two fingers side by side, spread.  Not all applications support zoom.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Pressure</b> <b>range</b> <b>increase</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>unexpected</b> <b>behavior</b>
       In  version 0.34, the driver's pressure range increased from 2048 steps to 65536 steps. The pressure axis
       range is advertised through the X Input Protocol but some applications have the previous  pressure  range
       hardcoded  and  cannot  handle  pressure values above 2048. This is an application bug but for backwards-
       compatibility with such applications, this driver provides the <b>Pressure2K</b> option to reduce the  range  to
       2048  steps.  Note  that  this setting applies to the device. Once applied, all applications will see the
       reduced pressure range. It is not possible to provide this setting on a per-application basis.
