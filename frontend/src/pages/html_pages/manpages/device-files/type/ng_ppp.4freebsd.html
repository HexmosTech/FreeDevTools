</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ng_ppp — PPP protocol netgraph node type

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</b>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;netgraph/ng_ppp.h&gt;</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ppp</b> node type performs multiplexing for the PPP protocol.  It handles only packets that contain data,
       and forwards protocol negotiation and control packets to a separate controlling entity (e.g., a user-land
       daemon).   This  approach  combines  the  fast  dispatch of kernel implementations with the configuration
       flexibility of a user-land implementations.  The PPP node type  directly  supports  multi-link  PPP,  Van
       Jacobson  compression,  PPP  compression,  PPP  encryption,  and the IP, IPX, and AppleTalk protocols.  A
       single PPP node corresponds to one PPP multi-link bundle.

       There is a separate hook for each PPP link in  the  bundle,  plus  several  hooks  corresponding  to  the
       directly supported protocols.  For compression and encryption, separate attached nodes are required to do
       the  actual work.  The node type used will of course depend on the algorithm negotiated.  There is also a
       bypass hook which is used to handle any protocol not directly supported by the node.  This  includes  all
       of  the  control  protocols: LCP, IPCP, CCP, etc.  Typically this node is connected to a user-land daemon
       via a <u><a href="../man4/ng_socket.4.html">ng_socket</a></u>(4) type node.

</pre><h4><b>ENABLING</b> <b>FUNCTIONALITY</b></h4><pre>
       In general, the PPP node enables a specific link or functionality when (a) a  NGM_PPP_SET_CONFIG  message
       has  been  received  which  enables it, and (b) the corresponding hook(s) are connected.  This allows the
       controlling entity to use either method (a) or (b) (or both) to control the node's behavior.  When a link
       is connected but disabled, traffic can still flow on the link via the bypass hook (see below).

</pre><h4><b>LINK</b> <b>HOOKS</b></h4><pre>
       During normal operation, the individual PPP links are connected  to  hooks  link0,  link1,  etc.   Up  to
       NG_PPP_MAX_LINKS  links  are  supported.   These  device-independent  hooks transmit and receive full PPP
       frames, which include the PPP protocol, address, control, and information  fields,  but  no  checksum  or
       other link-specific fields.

       On  outgoing  frames,  when protocol compression has been enabled and the protocol number is suitable for
       compression, the protocol field will be compressed (i.e., sent as  one  byte  instead  of  two).   Either
       compressed  or  uncompressed  protocol fields are accepted on incoming frames.  Similarly, if address and
       control field compression has been enabled for the link, the address and control fields will  be  omitted
       (except  for  LCP  frames  as  required  by the standards).  Incoming frames have the address and control
       fields stripped automatically if present.

       Since all negotiation is handled outside the PPP node, the links should  not  be  connected  and  enabled
       until the corresponding link has reached the network phase (i.e., LCP negotiation and authentication have
       completed   successfully)   and  the  PPP  node  has  been  informed  of  the  link  parameters  via  the
       NGM_PPP_LINK_CONFIG message.

       When a link is connected but disabled, all received frames are forwarded directly out  the  bypass  hook,
       and  conversely, frames may be transmitted via the bypass hook as well.  This mode is appropriate for the
       link authentication phase.  As soon as the link is enabled, the PPP node  will  begin  processing  frames
       received on the link.

</pre><h4><b>COMPRESSION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENCRYPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Compression  is  supported  via two hooks, compress and decompress.  Compression and decompression can be
       enabled by toggling the <u>enableCompression</u>  and  <u>enableDecompression</u>  fields  of  the  node  configuration
       structure.  (See below.)  If <u>enableCompression</u> is set to NG_PPP_COMPRESS_SIMPLE, then all outgoing frames
       are sent to the compress hook and all packets received on this hook are expected to be compressed, so the
       COMPD  tag  is  put  on  them unconditionally.  If <u>enableCompression</u> is set to NG_PPP_COMPRESS_FULL, then
       packets received on the compress hook are resent as is.  The compressor node should put the tag,  if  the
       packet  was  compressed.   If  <u>enableDecompression</u> is set to NG_PPP_DECOMPRESS_SIMPLE, then the node will
       sent  to  the  decompress  hook  only  those  frames,  that  are  marked  with   the   COMPD   tag.    If
       <u>enableDecompression</u> is set to NG_PPP_DECOMPRESS_FULL, then the node will sent all incoming packets to the
       decompress   hook.    Compression   and   decompression   can  be  completely  disabled  by  setting  the
       <u>enableCompression</u> and <u>enableDecompression</u> fields to the NG_PPP_COMPRESS_NONE and  NG_PPP_DECOMPRESS_NONE,
       respectively.

       Encryption works exactly analogously via the encrypt and decrypt nodes.  Data is always compressed before
       being encrypted, and decrypted before being decompressed.

       Only bundle-level compression and encryption is directly supported; link-level compression and encryption
       can be handled transparently by downstream nodes.

</pre><h4><b>VAN</b> <b>JACOBSON</b> <b>COMPRESSION</b></h4><pre>
       When all of the vjc_ip, vjc_vjcomp, vjc_vjuncomp, and vjc_vjip hooks are connected, and the corresponding
       configuration  flag  is  enabled,  Van  Jacobson  compression  and/or  decompression  will become active.
       Normally these hooks connect to the corresponding hooks of a single <u><a href="../man4/ng_vjc.4.html">ng_vjc</a></u>(4)  node.   The  PPP  node  is
       compatible with the “pass through” modes of the <u><a href="../man4/ng_vjc.4.html">ng_vjc</a></u>(4) node type.

</pre><h4><b>BYPASS</b> <b>HOOK</b></h4><pre>
       When  a  frame is received on a link with an unsupported protocol, or a protocol which is disabled or for
       which the corresponding hook is unconnected, the PPP  node  forwards  the  frame  out  the  bypass  hook,
       prepended  with a four byte prefix.  This first two bytes of the prefix indicate the link number on which
       the frame was received (in network order).  For such frames received over the bundle (i.e.,  encapsulated
       in  the  multi-link protocol), the special link number NG_PPP_BUNDLE_LINKNUM is used.  After the two byte
       link number is the two byte PPP protocol number (also in network order).  The PPP protocol number is  two
       bytes long even if the original frame was protocol compressed.

       Conversely,  any  data  written  to  the bypass hook is assumed to be in this same format.  The four byte
       header is stripped off, the PPP protocol number is prepended (possibly  compressed),  and  the  frame  is
       delivered over the desired link.  If the link number is NG_PPP_BUNDLE_LINKNUM the frame will be delivered
       over the multi-link bundle; or, if multi-link is disabled, over the (single) PPP link.

       Typically when the controlling entity receives an unexpected packet on the bypass hook it responds either
       by  dropping  the  frame (if it is not ready for the protocol) or with an LCP protocol reject (if it does
       not recognize or expect the protocol).

</pre><h4><b>MULTILINK</b> <b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       To enable multi-link PPP, the corresponding configuration  flag  must  be  set  and  at  least  one  link
       connected.   The PPP node will not allow more than one link to be connected if multi-link is not enabled,
       nor will it allow certain multi-link settings to be changed while multi-link operation is  active  (e.g.,
       short sequence number header format).

       Since  packets  are  sent as fragments across multiple individual links, it is important that when a link
       goes down the PPP node is notified  immediately,  either  by  disconnecting  the  corresponding  hook  or
       disabling the link via the NGM_PPP_SET_CONFIG control message.

       Each  link  has configuration parameters for latency (specified in milliseconds) and bandwidth (specified
       in tens of bytes per second).  The PPP node  can  be  configured  for  <u>round-robin</u>  or  <u>optimized</u>  packet
       delivery.

       When  configured  for round-robin delivery, the latency and bandwidth values are ignored and the PPP node
       simply sends each frame as a single fragment, alternating frames across all  the  links  in  the  bundle.
       This  scheme has the advantage that even if one link fails silently, some packets will still get through.
       It has the disadvantage of sub-optimal  overall  bundle  latency,  which  is  important  for  interactive
       response time, and sub-optimal overall bundle bandwidth when links with different bandwidths exist in the
       same bundle.

       When  configured for optimal delivery, the PPP node distributes the packet across the links in a way that
       minimizes the time it takes for the completed packet to be received by the far end.  This involves taking
       into account each link's latency, bandwidth, and current queue length.  Therefore these numbers should be
       configured as accurately as possible.  The algorithm  does  require  some  computation,  so  may  not  be
       appropriate for very slow machines and/or very fast links.

       As  a  special  case,  if  all  links  have  identical latency and bandwidth, then the above algorithm is
       disabled (because it is unnecessary) and the PPP node simply fragments frames into equal  sized  portions
       across all of the links.

</pre><h4><b>HOOKS</b></h4><pre>
       This node type supports the following hooks:

       <u>link&lt;N&gt;</u>       Individual PPP link number &lt;N&gt;

       <u>compress</u>      Connection to compression engine

</pre><h4><b>CONTROL</b> <b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       This node type supports the generic control messages, plus the following:

       NGM_PPP_SET_CONFIG (<b>setconfig</b>)
            This command configures all aspects of the node.  This includes enabling multi-link PPP, encryption,
            compression, Van Jacobson compression, and  IP,  IPv6,  AppleTalk,  and  IPX  packet  delivery.   It
            includes  per-link  configuration,  including  enabling  the  link,  setting  latency  and bandwidth
            parameters, and enabling protocol field compression.  Note that no link or functionality  is  active
            until  the corresponding hook is also connected.  This command takes a struct ng_ppp_node_conf as an
            argument:

            /* Per-link config structure */
            struct ng_ppp_link_conf {
              u_char    enableLink;     /* enable this link */
              u_char    enableProtoComp;/* enable protocol field compression */
              u_char    enableACFComp;  /* enable addr/ctrl field compression */
              uint16_t  mru;            /* peer MRU */
              uint32_t  latency;        /* link latency (in milliseconds) */
              uint32_t  bandwidth;      /* link bandwidth (in bytes/sec/10) */
            };

            /* Bundle config structure */
            struct ng_ppp_bund_conf {
              uint16_t  mrru;                   /* multilink peer MRRU */
              u_char    enableMultilink;        /* enable multilink */
              u_char    recvShortSeq;           /* recv multilink short seq # */
              u_char    xmitShortSeq;           /* xmit multilink short seq # */
              u_char    enableRoundRobin;       /* xmit whole packets */
              u_char    enableIP;               /* enable IP data flow */
              u_char    enableIPv6;             /* enable IPv6 data flow */
              u_char    enableAtalk;            /* enable AppleTalk data flow */
              u_char    enableIPX;              /* enable IPX data flow */
              u_char    enableCompression;      /* enable PPP compression */
              u_char    enableDecompression;    /* enable PPP decompression */
              u_char    enableEncryption;       /* enable PPP encryption */
              u_char    enableDecryption;       /* enable PPP decryption */
              u_char    enableVJCompression;    /* enable VJ compression */
              u_char    enableVJDecompression;  /* enable VJ decompression */
            };

            struct ng_ppp_node_conf {
              struct ng_ppp_bund_conf   bund;
              struct ng_ppp_link_conf   links[NG_PPP_MAX_LINKS];
            };

       NGM_PPP_GET_CONFIG (<b>getconfig</b>)
            Returns the current configuration as a struct ng_ppp_node_conf.

       NGM_PPP_GET_LINK_STATS (<b>getstats</b>)
            This command takes a two byte link number as an  argument  and  returns  a  struct  ng_ppp_link_stat
            containing statistics for the corresponding link.  Here NG_PPP_BUNDLE_LINKNUM is a valid link number
            corresponding to the multi-link bundle.

       NGM_PPP_GET_LINK_STATS64 (<b>getstats64</b>)
            Same as NGM_PPP_GET_LINK_STATS but returns struct ng_ppp_link_stat64 containing 64bit counters.

       NGM_PPP_CLR_LINK_STATS (<b>clrstats</b>)
            This command takes a two byte link number as an argument and clears the statistics for that link.

       NGM_PPP_GETCLR_LINK_STATS (<b>getclrstats</b>)
            Same as NGM_PPP_GET_LINK_STATS, but also atomically clears the statistics as well.

       NGM_PPP_GETCLR_LINK_STATS64 (<b>getclrstats64</b>)
            Same as NGM_PPP_GETCLR_LINK_STATS but returns struct ng_ppp_link_stat64 containing 64bit counters.

       This  node  type  also  accepts the control messages accepted by the <u><a href="../man4/ng_vjc.4.html">ng_vjc</a></u>(4) node type.  When received,
       these messages are simply forwarded to the adjacent <u><a href="../man4/ng_vjc.4.html">ng_vjc</a></u>(4) node, if any.  This is particularly  useful
       when  the  individual  PPP  links  are  able to generate NGM_VJC_RECV_ERROR messages (see <u><a href="../man4/ng_vjc.4.html">ng_vjc</a></u>(4) for a
       description).

</pre><h4><b>SHUTDOWN</b></h4><pre>
       This node shuts down upon receipt of a  NGM_SHUTDOWN  control  message,  or  when  all  hooks  have  been
       disconnected.
