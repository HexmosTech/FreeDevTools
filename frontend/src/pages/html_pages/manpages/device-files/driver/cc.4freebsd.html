</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cxgbe — Chelsio T4-, T5-, and T6-based 100Gb, 40Gb, 25Gb, 10Gb, and 1Gb Ethernet adapter driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>device</b> <b>cxgbe</b>

       To load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following lines in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             t4fw_cfg_load="YES"
             t5fw_cfg_load="YES"
             t6fw_cfg_load="YES"
             if_cxgbe_load="YES"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>cxgbe</b>  driver  provides support for PCI Express Ethernet adapters based on the Chelsio Terminator 4,
       Terminator  5,  and  Terminator  6  ASICs  (T4,  T5,  and  T6).   The  driver  supports   Jumbo   Frames,
       Transmit/Receive  checksum offload, TCP segmentation offload (TSO), Large Receive Offload (LRO), VLAN tag
       insertion/extraction, VLAN checksum offload, VLAN TSO, and Receive  Side  Steering  (RSS).   For  further
       hardware information and questions related to hardware requirements, see <u><a href="http://www.chelsio.com/">http://www.chelsio.com/</a></u>.

       The <b>cxgbe</b> driver uses different names for devices based on the associated ASIC:

             <b>ASIC</b>    <b>Port</b> <b>Name</b>    <b>Parent</b> <b>Device</b>    <b>Virtual</b> <b>Interface</b>
             T4      cxgbe        t4nex            vcxgbe
             T5      cxl          t5nex            vcxl
             T6      cc           t6nex            vcc

       Loader  tunables  with  the hw.cxgbe prefix apply to all cards.  The driver provides sysctl MIBs for both
       ports and parent devices using the names above.  For example, a  T5  adapter  provides  port  MIBs  under
       dev.cxl  and  adapter-wide MIBs under dev.t5nex.  References to sysctl MIBs in the remainder of this page
       use dev.&lt;port&gt; for port MIBs and dev.&lt;nexus&gt; for adapter-wide MIBs.

       For more information on configuring this device, see <u><a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a></u>(8).

</pre><h4><b>LOADER</b> <b>TUNABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Tunables can be set at the <u><a href="../man8/loader.8.html">loader</a></u>(8) prompt before booting the kernel or stored in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5).  There
       are multiple tunables that control the number of queues of various types.  A negative value  for  such  a
       tunable instructs the driver to create up to that many queues if there are enough CPU cores available.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.ntxq</u>
               Number  of  NIC  tx  queues used for a port.  The default is 16 or the number of CPU cores in the
               system, whichever is less.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.nrxq</u>
               Number of NIC rx queues used for a port.  The default is 8 or the number  of  CPU  cores  in  the
               system, whichever is less.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.nofldtxq</u>
               Number  of  TOE  tx  queues  used for a port.  The default is 8 or the number of CPU cores in the
               system, whichever is less.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.nofldrxq</u>
               Number of TOE rx queues used for a port.  The default is 2 or the number  of  CPU  cores  in  the
               system, whichever is less.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.num_vis</u>
               Number  of  virtual  interfaces  (VIs)  created  for each port.  Each virtual interface creates a
               separate network interface.  The first virtual interface on each port is required and  represents
               the  primary  network  interface  on the port.  Additional virtual interfaces on a port are named
               using the Virtual Interface name from the table  above.   Additional  virtual  interfaces  use  a
               single  pair of queues for rx and tx as well an additional pair of queues for TOE rx and tx.  The
               default is 1.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.holdoff_timer_idx</u>

       <u>hw.cxgbe.holdoff_timer_idx_ofld</u>
               Timer index value used to delay interrupts.  The holdoff timer list has the values 1, 5, 10,  50,
               100,  and 200 by default (all values are in microseconds) and the index selects a value from this
               list.  holdoff_timer_idx_ofld applies to queues used for TOE rx.  The default value  is  1  which
               means  the timer value is 5us.  Different interfaces can be assigned different values at any time
               via the dev.&lt;port&gt;.X.holdoff_tmr_idx and dev.&lt;port&gt;.X.holdoff_tmr_idx_ofld sysctls.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.holdoff_pktc_idx</u>

       <u>hw.cxgbe.holdoff_pktc_idx_ofld</u>
               Packet-count index value used to delay interrupts.  The packet-count list has the  values  1,  8,
               16,  and  32  by  default,  and  the index selects a value from this list.  holdoff_pktc_idx_ofld
               applies to queues used for TOE rx.  The default value  is  -1  which  means  packet  counting  is
               disabled  and  interrupts  are  generated  based  solely  on  the holdoff timer value.  Different
               interfaces  can  be  assigned  different  values  via   the   dev.&lt;port&gt;.X.holdoff_pktc_idx   and
               dev.&lt;port&gt;.X.holdoff_pktc_idx_ofld sysctls.  These sysctls work only when the interface has never
               been marked up (as done by ifconfig up).

       <u>hw.cxgbe.qsize_txq</u>
               Number  of  entries  in  a transmit queue's descriptor ring.  A buf_ring of the same size is also
               allocated for additional software queuing.  See <u><a href="../man9/ifnet.9.html">ifnet</a></u>(9).  The default value is 1024.   Different
               interfaces  can  be assigned different values via the dev.&lt;port&gt;.X.qsize_txq sysctl.  This sysctl
               works only when the interface has never been marked up (as done by ifconfig up).

       <u>hw.cxgbe.qsize_rxq</u>
               Number of entries in a receive queue's descriptor ring.  The default value  is  1024.   Different
               interfaces  can  be assigned different values via the dev.&lt;port&gt;.X.qsize_rxq sysctl.  This sysctl
               works only when the interface has never been marked up (as done by ifconfig up).

       <u>hw.cxgbe.interrupt_types</u>
               Permitted interrupt types.  Bit 0 represents INTx (line interrupts), bit 1 MSI, and bit 2  MSI-X.
               The  default  is  7  (all allowed).  The driver selects the best possible type out of the allowed
               types.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.pcie_relaxed_ordering</u>
               PCIe Relaxed Ordering.  -1 indicates the driver should determine whether  to  enable  or  disable
               PCIe  RO.   0 disables PCIe RO.  1 enables PCIe RO.  2 indicates the driver should not modify the
               PCIe RO setting.  The default is -1.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.fw_install</u>
               0 prohibits the driver from installing a firmware on the card.  1 allows the driver to install  a
               new  firmware  if  internal driver heuristics indicate that the new firmware is preferable to the
               one already on the card.  2 instructs the driver to always install the new firmware on  the  card
               as  long  as  it is compatible with the driver and is a different version than the one already on
               the card.  The default is 1.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.fl_pktshift</u>
               Number of padding bytes inserted before the beginning of an Ethernet frame in the receive buffer.
               The default value is 0.  A value of of 2 would ensure that the Ethernet payload (usually  the  IP
               header) is at a 4 byte aligned address.  0-7 are all valid values.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.fl_pad</u>
               A  non-zero  value ensures that writes from the hardware to a receive buffer are padded up to the
               specified boundary.  The default is -1 which lets the driver pick a  pad  boundary.   0  disables
               trailer padding completely.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.cong_drop</u>
               Controls  the  hardware  response  to  congestion.   -1  disables  congestion feedback and is not
               recommended.  0 instructs the hardware to backpressure its pipeline on congestion.  This  usually
               results  in the port emitting PAUSE frames.  1 instructs the hardware to drop frames destined for
               congested queues.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.pause_settings</u>
               PAUSE frame settings.  Bit 0 is rx_pause, bit 1 is tx_pause, bit 2 is pause_autoneg.  rx_pause  =
               1  instructs the hardware to heed incoming PAUSE frames, 0 instructs it to ignore them.  tx_pause
               = 1 allows the hardware to emit PAUSE frames when its receive FIFO reaches a  high  threshold,  0
               prohibits  the hardware from emitting PAUSE frames.  pause_autoneg = 1 overrides the rx_pause and
               tx_pause bits and instructs the hardware to negotiate PAUSE settings with  the  link  peer.   The
               default is 7 (all three = 1).  This tunable establishes the default PAUSE settings for all ports.
               Settings  can be displayed and controlled on a per-port basis via the dev.&lt;port&gt;.X.pause_settings
               sysctl.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.fec</u>
               Forward Error Correction settings.  -1 (default) means driver should automatically pick a  value.
               0 disables FEC.  Finer grained control can be achieved by setting individual bits.  Bit 0 enables
               RS  FEC, bit 1 enables BASE-R FEC (aka Firecode FEC), bit 2 enables NO FEC, and bit 6 enables the
               FEC that is recommended by the transceiver/cable that is plugged  in.   These  bits  can  be  set
               together  in  any  combination.  This tunable establishes the default FEC settings for all ports.
               Settings can be displayed and controlled on a per-port basis via the dev.&lt;port&gt;.X.fec sysctl.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.autoneg</u>
               Link autonegotiation settings.  This tunable establishes the default autonegotiation settings for
               all  ports.   Settings  can  be  displayed  and  controlled  on  a   per-port   basis   via   the
               dev.&lt;port&gt;.X.autoneg  sysctl.   0  disables  autonegotiation.   1  enables  autonegotiation.  The
               default is -1 which lets the driver pick a value.  dev.&lt;port&gt;.X.autoneg is -1 for port and module
               combinations that do not support autonegotiation.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.buffer_packing</u>
               Allow the hardware to deliver multiple frames in the same receive buffer opportunistically.   The
               default is -1 which lets the driver decide.  0 or 1 explicitly disable or enable this feature.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.largest_rx_cluster</u>

       <u>hw.cxgbe.safest_rx_cluster</u>
               Sizes  of  rx  clusters.   Each of these must be set to one of the sizes available (usually 2048,
               4096, 9216, and 16384) and largest_rx_cluster must be greater than or equal to safest_rx_cluster.
               The defaults are 16384 and 4096 respectively.  The driver never attempts to  allocate  a  receive
               buffer  larger  than largest_rx_cluster and falls back to allocating buffers of safest_rx_cluster
               size if an allocation larger than safest_rx_cluster fails.  Note that  largest_rx_cluster  merely
               establishes a ceiling -- the driver is allowed to allocate buffers of smaller sizes.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.config_file</u>
               Select  a  pre-packaged  device  configuration  file.  A configuration file contains a recipe for
               partitioning and configuring the hardware resources on the card.  This tunable is for specialized
               applications only and should  not  be  used  in  normal  operation.   The  configuration  profile
               currently in use is available in the dev.&lt;nexus&gt;.X.cf and dev.&lt;nexus&gt;.X.cfcsum sysctls.

       <u>hw.cxgbe.linkcaps_allowed</u>

       <u>hw.cxgbe.niccaps_allowed</u>

       <u>hw.cxgbe.toecaps_allowed</u>

       <u>hw.cxgbe.rdmacaps_allowed</u>

       <u>hw.cxgbe.iscsicaps_allowed</u>

       <u>hw.cxgbe.fcoecaps_allowed</u>
               Disallowing  capabilities  provides  a  hint  to  the driver and firmware to not reserve hardware
               resources for that feature.  Each of these is a bit field with  a  bit  for  each  sub-capability
               within  the capability.  This tunable is for specialized applications only and should not be used
               in normal operation.  The capabilities for which hardware resources have been reserved are listed
               in dev.&lt;nexus&gt;.X.*caps sysctls.
