</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       isp — Qlogic based SPI and FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>device</b> <b>scbus</b>
             <b>device</b> <b>isp</b>
             <b>device</b> <b>ispfw</b>

       Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following lines in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             isp_load="YES"
             ispfw_load="YES"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This driver provides access to SPI or FibreChannel SCSI devices.

       SPI  supports initiator mode for Ultra SCSI and wide mode transactions for SCSI, Ultra2 LVD (1080, 1280),
       and Ultra3 LVD (10160, 12160).

       Fibre Channel supports initiator and target modes of FCP SCSI profile, utilizing  Class  3  and  Class  2
       (2200  and  later)  connections.   Support  is available for Public and Private loops, Point-to-Point and
       Fabric connections.

       FC-Tape is supported on 4Gb (2400) and newer controllers.  FC-Tape is highly recommended for  connections
       to tape drives that support it.  It encompasses four elements from the T-10 FCP-4 specification:

             <b>•</b>   Precise Delivery of Commands

             <b>•</b>   Confirmed Completion of FCP I/O Operations

             <b>•</b>   Retransmission of Unsuccessfully Transmitted IUs

             <b>•</b>   Task Retry Identification

       Together  these features allow for link level error recovery with tape devices.  Without it, an initiator
       cannot, for instance, tell whether a tape write command that has timed out resulted in all, part or  none
       of  the  data  going to the tape drive.  FC-Tape is automatically enabled when connecting controller that
       supports it to a target that supports it.  It may  be  disabled  using  configuration  and  hint  options
       described below.

</pre><h4><b>FIRMWARE</b></h4><pre>
       Firmware  loading is supported if the <u><a href="../man4/ispfw.4.html">ispfw</a></u>(4) module is loaded.  It is strongly recommended that you use
       the firmware available from <u><a href="../man4/ispfw.4.html">ispfw</a></u>(4) as it is the most likely to have been tested with this driver.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Target mode support for Fibre Channel adapters may be enabled with the

       <b>options</b> <b>ISP_TARGET_MODE</b>

       option.

       To disable FC-Tape, use the following configuration option:

       <b>options</b> <b>ISP_FCTAPE_OFF</b>

       Note  that  even  if the ISP_FCTAPE_OFF option is used, it may be overridden by the fctape hint described
       below.

</pre><h4><b>BOOT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are switchable by setting values in <u>/boot/device.hints</u>.

       They are:

       <u>hint.isp.N.msi</u>
               Limit on number of Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) to be used.

       <u>hint.isp.N.msix</u>
               Limit on number of Extended Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI-X) to be used.

       <u>hint.isp.N.fwload_disable</u>
               A hint value to disable loading of firmware <u><a href="../man4/ispfw.4.html">ispfw</a></u>(4).

       <u>hint.isp.N.ignore_nvram</u>
               A hint value to ignore board NVRAM settings for.  Otherwise use NVRAM settings.

       <u>hint.isp.N.fullduplex</u>
               A hint value to set full duplex mode.

       <u>hint.isp.N.topology</u>
               A hint value to select topology of connection.  Supported values are:

               <b>lport</b>       Prefer loopback and fallback to point to point.
               <b>nport</b>       Prefer point to point and fallback to loopback.
               <b>lport-only</b>  Loopback only.
               <b>nport-only</b>  Point to point only.

       <u>hint.isp.N.portwwn</u>
               This should be the full 64 bit World Wide Port Name you would like to use, overriding  the  value
               in NVRAM for the card.

       <u>hint.isp.N.nodewwn</u>
               This  should  be the full 64 bit World Wide Node Name you would like to use, overriding the value
               in NVRAM for the card.

       <u>hint.isp.N.iid</u>
               A hint to override or set the Initiator ID or Loop ID.  For Fibre Channel  cards  in  Local  Loop
               topologies it is <u>strongly</u> recommended that you set this value to non-zero.

       <u>hint.isp.N.role</u>
               A  hint  to  define  default  role for isp instance (0 -- none, 1 -- target, 2 -- initiator, 3 --
               both).

       <u>hint.isp.N.debug</u>
               A hint value for a driver debug level (see the file <u>/usr/src/sys/dev/isp/ispvar.h</u> for the values.

       <u>hint.isp.N.vports</u>
               A hint to create specified number of additional virtual ports.

       <u>hint.isp.N.nofctape</u>
               Set this to 1 to disable FC-Tape operation on the given isp instance.

       <u>hint.isp.N.fctape</u>
               Set this to 1 to enable FC-Tape operation on the given isp instance for targets that support it.

</pre><h4><b>SYSCTL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>dev.isp.N.loop_down_limit</u>
               This value says how long to wait in seconds after  loop  has  gone  down  before  giving  up  and
               expiring  all  of  the  devices  that  were  visible.  The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).  A
               separate (nonadjustable) timeout is used  when  booting  to  not  stop  booting  on  lack  of  FC
               connectivity.

       <u>dev.isp.N.gone_device_time</u>
               This  value  says how long to wait for devices to reappear if they (temporarily) disappear due to
               loop or fabric events.  While this timeout is running, I/O to those devices will simply be held.

       <u>dev.isp.N.use_gff_id</u>

       <u>dev.isp.N.use_gft_id</u>
               Setting those options to 0 allows to disable use of GFF_ID and  GFT_ID  SNS  requests  during  FC
               fabric  scan.   It  may  be  useful  if switch does not implement them correctly, preventing some
               devices from being found.  Disabling them may cause  unneeded  logins  to  ports  not  supporting
               target role or even FCP at all.  The default is 1 (enabled).

       <u>dev.isp.N.wwnn</u>
               This is the readonly World Wide Node Name value for this port.

       <u>dev.isp.N.wwpn</u>
               This is the readonly World Wide Port Name value for this port.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>isp</b>  driver  was written by Matthew Jacob originally for NetBSD at NASA/Ames Research Center.  Later
       improvement was done by
       Alexander Motin &lt;<u><a href="mailto:mav@FreeBSD.org">mav@FreeBSD.org</a></u>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The driver currently ignores some NVRAM settings.

       Fabric support for 2100 cards has been so problematic, and these cards are so old now that it is just not
       worth your time to try it.
