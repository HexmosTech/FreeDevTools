</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       superio — Super I/O controller and bus driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>device</b> <b>superio</b>

       Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             superio_load="YES"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Super  I/O  is  an  I/O  controller  that combines various low-bandwidth devices that can be functionally
       unrelated otherwise.  A typical Super I/O can contain devices such as
       <b>•</b>   a floppy disk controller
       <b>•</b>   a parallel port
       <b>•</b>   a serial port
       <b>•</b>   a PS/2 mouse and keyboard controller
       <b>•</b>   a hardware monitoring controller
       <b>•</b>   a watchdog timer
       <b>•</b>   a controller for general purpose input-output

       The <b>superio</b> driver provides support for devices residing in the Super I/O controller  that  can  only  be
       accessed or discovered using the controller's interface.  Some of the Super I/O devices have standardized
       interfaces.  Such devices either use well-known legacy resources or they are advertised via ACPI or both.
       They  can  be  configured either using ISA bus hints or they are auto-configured by <u><a href="../man4/acpi.4.html">acpi</a></u>(4).  The <b>superio</b>
       driver is not designed to interact with that kind of devices.  They can be handled  by  their  respective
       drivers  without  any  knowledge of the Super I/O specifics.  For instance, <u><a href="../man4/fdc.4.html">fdc</a></u>(4) provides access to the
       floppy disk controller.

       There are other Super I/O devices that do not have any standardized interface.  Drivers for those devices
       can be written using facilities of the <b>superio</b> driver.

       The driver itself attaches to the ISA bus as all supported controllers are accessed via LPC I/O ports.

       The <b>superio</b> driver is unusual as it is both a controller driver for a variety of  Super  I/O  controllers
       and a bus driver for supported devices in those controllers.

</pre><h4><b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>superio</b>  driver supports a multitude of Super I/O controllers produced by Nuvoton, formerly known as
       Winbond, and ITE.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>superio</b> driver was written by Andriy Gapon &lt;<u><a href="mailto:avg@FreeBSD.org">avg@FreeBSD.org</a></u>&gt;.
