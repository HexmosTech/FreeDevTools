</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ads111x — driver for ADS101x and ADS111x i2c analog to digital converters

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>device</b> <b>ads111x</b>

       Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             ads111x_load="YES"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ads111x</b>  driver provides support for the ADS101x/ADS111x family of analog to digital converter (ADC)
       devices.  The supported devices are all similar to each other, varying in features such as resolution and
       number of input channels.  The devices offer a number of configuration  options  which  can  be  set  via
       hints, FDT data, and <u><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></u>(8).

       <u><a href="../man8/Sysctl.8.html">Sysctl</a></u>(8)   provides   access   to   the  voltage  measurements  made  by  the  device.   Each  time  the
       <u>dev.ads111x.&lt;unit&gt;.&lt;channel&gt;.voltage</u> variable is accessed for a given channel, the  driver  switches  the
       chip's  internal  mux  to  choose  the  right  input  pins  for that channel, directs it to make a single
       measurement, and returns the measured value in microvolts.  The amount  of  time  required  to  make  the
       measurement  is  a  function of the sampling rate configured for the device.  While device is directed to
       make a single measurement, it still averages the input values for the same amount of time as it would  to
       emit  one  sample  if it were in continuous mode.  For example, if the sample rate were configured as 125
       samples per second, a single measurement would require 8 milliseconds.

       For devices that support multiple input pins, the device datasheet describes mux settings to control  how
       those  pins are interpeted when making either single-ended or differential measurements.  There are eight
       possible ways to combine the inputs from the four pins.  The <b>ads111x</b> driver models  that  by  creating  a
       separate output channel for each of the eight combinations.  To make a measurement on a given pin or pair
       of  pins,  you simply access the voltage variable for the channel number that corresponds the mux setting
       number (0 through 7) shown in the datasheet.  When the driver is configured with hints or  FDT  data,  it
       creates  sysctl  variables  for just the channels specified in the config data.  When there is no channel
       config data, it creates all eight possible channels so that you can access whichever one(s) you need.

       For devices that include an <u>alert</u> output pin, the <b>ads111x</b> driver does not directly  support  the  pin  in
       terms of sensing or acting on changes in the pin state.  However, you may connect the pin to a gpio input
       or  fan  controller or other external device, and use the driver's sysctl variables to configure behavior
       and threshold values for the  pin.   The  driver  avoids  perturbing  your  settings  as  it  does  other
       manipulations to the config register.

</pre><h4><b>SYSCTL</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Sysctl  variables  are  used  to  access the voltage measurements, and to change the configuration of the
       channels.  All writeable variables may also be set as  <u><a href="../man8/loader.8.html">loader</a></u>(8)  tunables.   Channel  numbers  in  these
       sysctl variables range from 0 through 7.

       <u>dev.ads111x.&lt;unit&gt;.config</u>
               Provides  access  to  the  configuration  register bits that control the alert pin configuration.
               Other bits which are controlled by the driver are masked out, and cannot  be  viewed  or  changed
               using this variable.

       <u>dev.ads111x.&lt;unit&gt;.lo_thresh</u>
               Sets the low threshold for activating the alert pin.

       <u>dev.ads111x.&lt;unit&gt;.hi_thresh</u>
               Sets the high threshold for activating the alert pin.

       <u>dev.ads111x.&lt;unit&gt;.&lt;channel&gt;.rate_index</u>
               Sets  the  sample  rate  for  the channel.  The device datasheet documents eight available sample
               rates, chosen by setting a value of 0 through 7 into the  corresponding  control  register  bits.
               This variable sets the value used for those bits when making a measurement on the given channel.

               Because  measurements  are always made in single-shot mode, think of this variable as controlling
               the averaging time for a single sample; the time to make a measurement is 1 / samplerate.

       <u>dev.ads111x.&lt;unit&gt;.&lt;channel&gt;.gain_index</u>
               Sets the programmable gain amplifier for the channel on devices which have an internal amplifier.
               The device datasheet documents eight available gain values,  chosen  by  setting  a  value  of  0
               through  7  into  the corresponding control register bits.  This variable sets the value used for
               those bits when making a measurement on the given channel.

       <u>dev.ads111x.&lt;unit&gt;.&lt;channel&gt;.voltage</u>
               Reading this variable causes the device to make a measurement on the corresponding  input  pin(s)
               and return the voltage in microvolts.

               Note  that  this  variable  does  not  appear when you list multiple sysctl variables -- you must
               access it specifically by name, because accessing it triggers device I/O.

</pre><h4><b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ads111x</b> driver provides support for the following devices:

             ADS1013     ADS1113
             ADS1014     ADS1114
             ADS1015     ADS1115

</pre><h4><b>FDT</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       On an <u><a href="../man4/fdt.4.html">fdt</a></u>(4) based system, the <b>ads111x</b> device is defined as  a  slave  device  subnode  of  the  i2c  bus
       controller  node.   All  properties  documented in the <u>ads1015.txt</u> bindings document can be used with the
       <b>ads111x</b> device.

       The following properties are required in the <b>ads111x</b> device subnode:

       <u>compatible</u>
               One of the following:
                     “ti,ads1013     “ti,ads1113””
                     “ti,ads1014     “ti,ads1114””
                     “ti,ads1015     “ti,ads1115””

       <u>reg</u>     I2c slave address of device.

       Specific channels can be configured by adding child nodes to  the  <b>ads111x</b>  node,  as  described  in  the
       standard  ads1015.txt bindings document.  If no channels are configured, sysctl variables will be created
       for all possible channels supported by the  device  type,  otherwise  only  the  specified  channels  are
       created.

   <b>Example</b> <b>including</b> <b>channel</b> <b>configuration</b>
             adc@48 {
                 compatible = "ti,ads1115";
                 reg = &lt;0x48&gt;;
                 status = "okay";
                 #address-cells = &lt;1&gt;;
                 #size-cells = &lt;0&gt;;

                 channel@6 {
                     reg = &lt;6&gt;;
                     ti,gain = &lt;3&gt;;
                     ti,datarate = &lt;4&gt;;
                 };
                 channel@7 {
                     reg = &lt;7&gt;;
                     ti,gain = &lt;1&gt;;
                     ti,datarate = &lt;7&gt;;
                 };
             };

</pre><h4><b>HINTS</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       On a <u><a href="../man5/device.hints.5.html">device.hints</a></u>(5) based system, such as <b>MIPS</b>, these values are configurable for <b>ads111x</b>:

       <u>hint.ads111x.&lt;unit&gt;.at</u>
               The iicbus instance the <b>ads111x</b> instance is attached to.

       <u>hint.ads111x.&lt;unit&gt;.&lt;channel&gt;.gain_index</u>
               The     amplifier     gain,     as     described     above     for     the     sysctl    variable
               <u>dev.ads111x.&lt;unit&gt;.&lt;channel&gt;.gain_index</u>.

       <u>hint.ads111x.&lt;unit&gt;.&lt;channel&gt;.rate_index</u>
               The     sample     rate,     as     described     above     for     the      sysctl      variable
               <u>dev.ads111x.&lt;unit&gt;.&lt;channel&gt;.rate_index</u>.

       If  no  channels  are configured, sysctl variables will be created for all possible channels supported by
       the device type, otherwise only the specified channels are created.
