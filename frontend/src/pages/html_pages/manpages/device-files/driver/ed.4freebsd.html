</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ed — NE-2000 and WD-80x3 Ethernet driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>device</b> <b>miibus</b>
             <b>device</b> <b>ed</b>

       Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             if_ed_load="YES"

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATION</b> <b>NOTICE</b></h4><pre>
       The      <b>ed</b>     driver     is     not     present     in     FreeBSD     13.0     and     later.      See
       https://github.com/freebsd/fcp/blob/master/fcp-0101.md for more information.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ed</b> driver provides  support  for  8  and  16bit  Ethernet  cards  that  are  based  on  the  National
       Semiconductor  DS8390 and similar NICs manufactured by other companies.  The <b>ed</b> driver also supports many
       PC Card chips which interface via MII to a PHY.  Axiom's AX88790, AX88190 and AX88190A;  DLink's  DL10019
       and  DL10022;  and  Tamarack's  TC5299J  chips  all  support  internal  or external MII/PHY combinations.
       Realtek's PCI and ISA RTL80x9-based cards are also supported.  For these  chipsets,  autonegotiation  and
       status reporting are supported.

       In  addition  to  the standard port and IRQ specifications, the <b>ed</b> driver also supports a number of <b>flags</b>
       which can force 8/16bit mode, enable/disable multi-buffering,  and  select  the  default  interface  type
       (AUI/BNC, and for cards with twisted pair, AUI/10BaseT).

       The <b>flags</b> are a bit field, and are summarized as follows:

       <b>0x01</b>    Disable  transceiver.   On  those  cards which support it, this flag causes the transceiver to be
               disabled and the AUI connection to be used by default.

       <b>0x02</b>    Force 8bit mode.  This flag forces the card to 8bit mode regardless of how  the  card  identifies
               itself.   This may be needed for some clones which incorrectly identify themselves as 16bit, even
               though they only have an 8bit interface.  This flag takes precedence over force 16bit mode.

       <b>0x04</b>    Force 16bit mode.  This flag forces the card to 16bit mode regardless of how the card  identifies
               itself.   This  may be needed for some clones which incorrectly identify themselves as 8bit, even
               though they have a 16bit ISA interface.

       <b>0x08</b>    Disable transmitter multi-buffering.  This flag disables the use of multiple transmit buffers and
               may be necessary in rare cases where packets are sent out faster than a machine on the other  end
               can  handle  (as  evidenced  by  severe  packet  lossage).   Some (non-FreeBSD :-)) machines have
               terrible Ethernet performance and simply cannot cope with 1100K+ data rates.  Use  of  this  flag
               also  provides  one  more  packet  worth  of receiver buffering, and on 8bit cards, this may help
               reduce receiver lossage.

       When using a 3c503 card, the AUI connection may be selected by specifying the <b>link2</b> option to <u><a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a></u>(8)
       (BNC is the default).

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ed%d:</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>shared</b> <b>memory</b> <b>at</b> <b>%x</b> <b>-</b> <b>check</b> <b>configuration.</b>  When the card was probed at system boot
       time, the <b>ed</b> driver found that it could not clear the card's shared memory.  This is most commonly caused
       by a BIOS extension ROM being configured in the same address space as the Ethernet card's shared  memory.
       Either  find  the  offending  card and change its BIOS ROM to be at an address that does not conflict, or
       change the settings in <u><a href="../man5/device.hints.5.html">device.hints</a></u>(5) that the card's shared  memory  is  mapped  at  a  non-conflicting
       address.

       <b>ed%d:</b>  <b>Invalid</b>  <b>irq</b>  <b>configuration</b>  <b>(%d)</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>2-5</b> <b>for</b> <b>3c503.</b>  The IRQ number that was specified in the
       <u><a href="../man5/device.hints.5.html">device.hints</a></u>(5) file is not valid for the 3Com 3c503 card.  The 3c503 can only  be  assigned  to  IRQs  2
       through 5.

       <b>ed%d:</b> <b>Cannot</b> <b>find</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>RAM.</b>
       <b>ed%d:</b>  <b>Cannot</b>  <b>find</b>  <b>any</b>  <b>RAM,</b>  <b>start</b>  <b>:</b>  <b>%d,</b>  <b>x</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>%d.</b>  The probe of a Gateway card was unsuccessful in
       configuring the card's packet memory.  This likely indicates that the card was improperly recognized as a
       Gateway or that the card is defective.

       <b>ed:</b> <b>packets</b> <b>buffered,</b> <b>but</b> <b>transmitter</b> <b>idle.</b>  Indicates a logic  problem  in  the  driver.   Should  never
       happen.

       <b>ed%d:</b>  <b>device</b> <b>timeout</b>  Indicates that an expected transmitter interrupt did not occur.  Usually caused by
       an interrupt conflict with another card on the ISA bus.  This condition  could  also  be  caused  if  the
       kernel is configured for a different IRQ channel than the one the card is actually using.  If that is the
       case,  you  will  have  to either reconfigure the card using a DOS utility or set the jumpers on the card
       appropriately.

       <b>ed%d:</b> <b>NIC</b> <b>memory</b> <b>corrupt</b> <b>-</b> <b>invalid</b> <b>packet</b> <b>length</b> <b>%d.</b>  Indicates that a packet was received with a  packet
       length  that was either larger than the maximum size or smaller than the minimum size allowed by the IEEE
       802.3 standard.  Usually caused by a conflict with another card on the ISA bus, but  in  some  cases  may
       also indicate faulty cabling.

       <b>ed%d:</b> <b>remote</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>DMA</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete.</b>  This indicates that a programmed I/O transfer to an NE1000
       or  NE2000 style card has failed to properly complete.  Usually caused by the ISA bus speed being set too
       fast.

       <b>ed%d:</b> <b>Invalid</b> <b>irq</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>(%ld)</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>%s</b> <b>for</b> <b>%s</b>  Indicates the device has a  different  IRQ  than
       supported or expected.

       <b>ed%d:</b> <b>Cannot</b> <b>locate</b> <b>my</b> <b>ports!</b>  The device is using a different I/O port than the driver knows about.

       <b>ed%d:</b> <b>Cannot</b> <b>extract</b> <b>MAC</b> <b>address</b>  Attempts to get the MAC address failed.

       <b>ed%d:</b>  <b>Missing</b>  <b>mii!</b>    Probing  for an MII bus has failed.  This indicates a coding error in the PC Card
       attachment, because a PHY is required for the chips that generate this error message.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ed</b> device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 1.0.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ed</b> device driver and this manual page were written by David Greenman.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Early revision DS8390 chips have problems.  They lock up  whenever  the  receive  ring-buffer  overflows.
       They  occasionally switch the byte order of the length field in the packet ring header (several different
       causes of this related to an off-by-one byte alignment) - resulting in  "<b>NIC</b>  <b>memory</b>  <b>corrupt</b>  <b>-</b>  <b>invalid</b>
       <b>packet</b>  <b>length</b>"  messages.   The  card  is reset whenever these problems occur, but otherwise there is no
       problem with recovering from these conditions.

       The NIC memory access to 3Com and Novell cards is much slower than it is on WD/SMC cards; it is less than
       1MB/second on 8bit boards and less than 2MB/second on the 16bit cards.   This  can  lead  to  ring-buffer
       overruns resulting in dropped packets during heavy network traffic.

       The  Mitsubishi  B8895 PC Card uses a DP83902, but its ASIC part is undocumented.  Neither the NE2000 nor
       the WD83x0 drivers work with this card.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ed</b> driver is a bit too aggressive about resetting the card whenever any bad packets are received.  As
       a result, it may throw out some good packets which have been received but not yet  transferred  from  the
       card to main memory.

       The <b>ed</b> driver is slow by today's standards.

       PC Card attachment supports the D-Link DMF650TX LAN/Modem card's Ethernet port only at this time.

       Some  devices  supported  by  <b>ed</b>  do  not  generate the link state change events used by <u><a href="../man8/devd.8.html">devd</a></u>(8) to start
       <u><a href="../man8/dhclient.8.html">dhclient</a></u>(8).  If you have problems with <u><a href="../man8/dhclient.8.html">dhclient</a></u>(8) not starting and the device is always attached to the
       network it may be possible to work around this by changing “<b>DHCP</b>” to “<b>SYNCDHCP</b>” in the <u>ifconfig_ed0</u> entry
       in <u>/etc/rc.conf</u>.
