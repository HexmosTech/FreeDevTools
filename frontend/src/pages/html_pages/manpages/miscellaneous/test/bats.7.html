</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bats</b> - Bats test file format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  Bats test file is a Bash script with special syntax for defining test cases. Under the hood, each test
       case is just a function with a description.

           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?env">/usr/bin/env</a> bats

           @test "addition using bc" {
             result="$(echo 2+2 | bc)"
             [ "$result" -eq 4 ]
           }

           @test "addition using dc" {
             result="$(echo 2 2+p | dc)"
             [ "$result" -eq 4 ]
           }

       Each Bats test file is evaluated n+1 times, where <u>n</u> is the number of test cases in the  file.  The  first
       run  counts  the number of test cases, then iterates over the test cases and executes each one in its own
       process.

</pre><h4><b>Tagging</b> <b>tests</b></h4><pre>
       Each test has a list of tags attached to it. Without specification, this  list  is  empty.  Tags  can  be
       defined in two ways. The first being <b>#</b> <b>bats</b> <b>test_tags=</b>:

       # bats test_tags=tag:1, tag:2, tag:3 @test "second test" { # ... }

       @test "second test" { # ... }

       These  tags  (<b>tag:1</b>,  <b>tag:2</b>, <b>tag:3</b>) will be attached to the test <b>first</b> <b>test</b>. The second test will have no
       tags attached. Values defined in the <b>#</b> <b>bats</b> <b>test_tags=</b> directive will be assigned to the next <b>@test</b>  that
       is  being  encountered in the file and forgotten after that. Only the value of the last <b>#</b> <b>bats</b> <b>test_tags=</b>
       directive before a given test will be used.

       Sometimes, we want to give all tests in a file a set of the same tags. This can be achieved  via  <b>#</b>  <b>bats</b>
       <b>file_tags=</b>.  They  will  be  added  to  all  tests in the file after that directive. An additional <b>#</b> <b>bats</b>
       <b>file_tags=</b> directive will override the previously defined values:

           @test "Zeroth test" {
             # will have no tags
           }

           # bats file_tags=a:b
           # bats test_tags=c:d

           @test "First test" {
             # will be tagged a:b, c:d
           }

           # bats file_tags=

           @test "Second test" {
             # will have no tags
           }

       Tags are case sensitive and must only consist of alphanumeric characters and <b>_</b>, <b>-</b>, or <b>:</b>.  They  must  not
       contain whitespaces! The colon is intended as a separator for (recursive) namespacing.

       Tag  lists must be separated by commas and are allowed to contain whitespace. They must not contain empty
       tags like <b>test_tags=,b</b> (first tag  is  empty),  <b>test_tags=a,,c</b>,  <b>test_tags=a,</b>  <b>,c</b>  (second  tag  is  only
       whitespace/empty), <b>test_tags=a,b,</b> (third tag is empty).

       Every tag starting with <b>bats:</b> (case insensitive!) is reserved for Bats´ internal use:

       <b>bats:focus</b>
              If  any  test  with the tag <b>bats:focus</b> is encountered in a test suite, only those tagged with this
              tag will be executed. To prevent the CI from silently running on a  subset  of  tests  due  to  an
              accidentally committed <b>bats:focus</b> tag, the exit code of successful runs will be overridden to 1.

              Should  you  require  the  true  exit  code, e.g. for a <b>git</b> <b>bisect</b> operation, you can disable this
              behavior by setting <b>BATS_NO_FAIL_FOCUS_RUN=1</b> when running <b>bats</b>, but make sure to not  commit  this
              to CI!

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>RUN</b> <b>HELPER</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: run [OPTIONS] [--]

       Many  Bats  tests  need  to run a command and then make assertions about its exit status and output. Bats
       includes a <b>run</b> helper that invokes its arguments as a command, saves the  exit  status  and  output  into
       special  global  variables,  and  (optionally)  checks  exit  status  against  a given expected value. If
       successful, <b>run</b> returns with a <b>0</b> status code so you can continue to make assertions in your test case.

       For example, let´s say you´re testing that the <b>foo</b> command, when passed  a  nonexistent  filename,  exits
       with a <b>1</b> status code and prints an error message.

           @test "invoking foo with a nonexistent file prints an error" {
             run -1 foo nonexistent_filename
             [ "$output" = "foo: no such file ´nonexistent_filename´" ]
           }

       The  <b>-1</b>  as first argument tells <b>run</b> to expect 1 as an exit status, and to fail if the command exits with
       any other value. On failure, both actual and expected values will be displayed, along  with  the  invoked
       command and its output:

           (in test file test.bats, line 2)
            `run -1 foo nonexistent_filename´ failed, expected exit code 1, got 127

       This error indicates a possible problem with the installation or configuration of <b>foo</b>; note that a simple
       <b>[</b> <b>$status</b> <b>!=</b> <b>0</b> <b>]</b> test would not have caught this kind of failure.

       The  <b>$status</b>  variable  contains  the  status  code of the command, and the <b>$output</b> variable contains the
       combined contents of the command´s standard output and standard error streams.

       A third special variable, the <b>$lines</b> array, is available for easily accessing individual lines of output.
       For example, if you want to test that invoking <b>foo</b> without any arguments prints usage information on  the
       first line:

           @test "invoking foo without arguments prints usage" {
             run -1 foo
             [ "${lines[0]}" = "usage: foo &lt;filename&gt;" ]
           }

       By default <b>run</b> leaves out empty lines in <b>${lines[@]}</b>. Use <b>run</b> <b>--keep-empty-lines</b> to retain them.

       Additionally,  you  can  use  <b>--separate-stderr</b>  to  split  stdout  and  stderr  into <b>$output</b>/<b>$stderr</b> and
       <b>${lines[@]}</b>/<b>${stderr_lines[@]}</b>.

       All additional parameters to run should come before the command. If you want to run a command that starts
       with <b>-</b>, prefix it with <b>--</b> to prevent <b>run</b> from parsing it as an option.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>LOAD</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       You may want to share common code across multiple test files. Bats includes a convenient <b>load</b> command for
       sourcing a Bash source file relative to the location of the current test file. For example, if you have a
       Bats test in <b>test/foo.bats</b>, the command

           load test_helper

       will source the script <b>test/test_helper.bash</b> in your test file. This can be useful for sharing  functions
       to set up your environment or load fixtures.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>BATS_LOAD_LIBRARY</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       Some  libraries  are  installed  on the system, e.g. by <b>npm</b> or <b>brew</b>. These should not be <b>load</b>ed, as their
       path depends on the installation method. Instead, one should use <b>bats_load_library</b> together with  setting
       <b>BATS_LIB_PATH</b>, a <b>PATH</b>-like colon-delimited variable.

       <b>bats_load_library</b> has two modes of resolving requests:

       1.  by relative path from the <b>BATS_LIB_PATH</b> to a file in the library

       2.  by library name, expecting libraries to have a <b>load.bash</b> entrypoint

       For   example  if  your  <b>BATS_LIB_PATH</b>  is  set  to  <b><a href="file:~/.bats/libs">~/.bats/libs</a>:/usr/lib/bats</b>,  then  <b>bats_load_library</b>
       <b>test_helper</b> would look for existing files with the following paths:

       ○   <b><a href="file:~/.bats/libs/test_helper">~/.bats/libs/test_helper</a></b>

       ○   <b><a href="file:~/.bats/libs/test_helper/load.bash">~/.bats/libs/test_helper/load.bash</a></b>

       ○   <b>/usr/lib/bats/test_helper</b>

       ○   <b>/usr/lib/bats/test_helper/load.bash</b>

       The first existing file in this list will be sourced.

       If you want to load only part of a library or the entry point is not named <b>load.bash</b>, you have to include
       it in the argument: <b>bats_load_library</b> <b>library_name/file_to_load</b> will try

       ○   <b><a href="file:~/.bats/libs/library_name/file_to_load">~/.bats/libs/library_name/file_to_load</a></b>

       ○   <b><a href="file:~/.bats/libs/library_name/file_to_load/load.bash">~/.bats/libs/library_name/file_to_load/load.bash</a></b>

       ○   <b>/usr/lib/bats/library_name/file_to_load</b>

       ○   <b>/usr/lib/bats/library_name/file_to_load/load.bash</b>

       Apart from the changed lookup rules, <b>bats_load_library</b> behaves like <b>load</b>.

       <b>Note</b>: As seen above <b>load.bash</b> is the entry point for libraries and meant to  load  more  files  from  its
       directory or other libraries.

       <b>Note</b>:  Obviously,  the actual <b>BATS_LIB_PATH</b> is highly dependent on the environment. To maintain a uniform
       location across systems, (distribution) package maintainers are encouraged to use <b>/usr/lib/bats/</b>  as  the
       install  path  for  libraries  where  possible.  However,  if  the  package manager has another preferred
       location, like <b>npm</b> or <b>brew</b>, you should use this instead.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>SKIP</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       Tests can be skipped by using the <b>skip</b> command at the point in a test you wish to skip.

           @test "A test I don´t want to execute for now" {
             skip
             run -0 foo
           }

       Optionally, you may include a reason for skipping:

           @test "A test I don´t want to execute for now" {
             skip "This command will return zero soon, but not now"
             run -0 foo
           }

       Or you can skip conditionally:

           @test "A test which should run" {
             if [ foo != bar ]; then
               skip "foo isn´t bar"
             fi

             run -0 foo
           }

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>BATS_REQUIRE_MINIMUM_VERSION</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       Code for newer versions of Bats can be incompatible with older versions. In the best case this will  lead
       to  an  error  message  and  a  failed  test  suite.  In the worst case, the tests will pass erroneously,
       potentially masking a failure.

       Use <b>bats_require_minimum_version</b> <b>&lt;Bats</b> <b>version</b> <b>number&gt;</b> to  avoid  this.  It  communicates  in  a  concise
       manner, that you intend the following code to be run under the given Bats version or higher.

       Additionally,  this function will communicate the current Bats version floor to subsequent code, allowing
       e.g. Bats´ internal warning to give more informed warnings.

       <b>Note</b>: By default,  calling  <b>bats_require_minimum_version</b>  with  versions  before  Bats  1.7.0  will  fail
       regardless  of  the  required  version  as  the  function  is  not  available.  However,  you can use the
       bats-backports plugin (https://github.com/bats-core/bats-backports) to make your code usable  with  older
       versions, e.g. during migration while your CI system is not yet upgraded.

</pre><h4><b>SETUP</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TEARDOWN</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  define  special  <b>setup</b>  and  <b>teardown</b>  functions  which  run  before  and after each test case,
       respectively. Use these to load fixtures, set up your environment, and clean up when you´re done.

</pre><h4><b>CODE</b> <b>OUTSIDE</b> <b>OF</b> <b>TEST</b> <b>CASES</b></h4><pre>
       You can include code in your test file outside of <b>@test</b> functions. For example, this may be useful if you
       want to check for dependencies and fail immediately if they´re not present. However, any output that  you
       print  in  code  outside  of  <b>@test</b>,  <b>setup</b>  or  <b>teardown</b>  functions  must be redirected to <b>stderr</b> (<b>&gt;&amp;2</b>).
       Otherwise, the output may cause Bats to fail by polluting the TAP stream on <b>stdout</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       There are several global variables you can use to introspect on Bats tests:

       ○   <b>$BATS_TEST_FILENAME</b> is the fully expanded path to the Bats test file.

       ○   <b>$BATS_TEST_DIRNAME</b> is the directory in which the Bats test file is located.

       ○   <b>$BATS_TEST_NAMES</b> is an array of function names for each test case.

       ○   <b>$BATS_TEST_NAME</b> is the name of the function containing the current test case.

       ○   <b>BATS_TEST_NAME_PREFIX</b> will be prepended to the description of each test on stdout and in reports.

       ○   <b>$BATS_TEST_DESCRIPTION</b> is the description of the current test case.

       ○   <b>BATS_TEST_RETRIES</b> is the maximum number of additional attempts that will be made  on  a  failed  test
           before  it  is  finally  considered  failed.  The  default of 0 means the test must pass on the first
           attempt.

       ○   <b>BATS_TEST_TIMEOUT</b> is the number of seconds after which a test (including setup) will be  aborted  and
           marked  as  failed.  Updates  to  this  value  in  <b>setup()</b> or <b>@test</b> cannot change the running timeout
           countdown, so the latest useful update location is <b>setup_file()</b>.

       ○   <b>$BATS_TEST_NUMBER</b> is the (1-based) index of the current test case in the test file.

       ○   <b>$BATS_SUITE_TEST_NUMBER</b> is the (1-based) index of the current test case in the test suite  (over  all
           files).

       ○   <b>$BATS_TMPDIR</b>  is  the  base  temporary  directory  used  by  bats  to  create  its  temporary files /
           directories. (default: <b>$TMPDIR</b>. If <b>$TMPDIR</b> is not set, <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> is used.)

       ○   <b>$BATS_RUN_TMPDIR</b> is the location to the temporary directory used by bats to store  all  its  internal
           temporary files during the tests. (default: <b>$BATS_TMPDIR/bats-run-$BATS_ROOT_PID-XXXXXX</b>)

       ○   <b>$BATS_FILE_EXTENSION</b>  (default: <b>bats</b>) specifies the extension of test files that should be found when
           running a suite (via <b>bats</b> <b>[-r]</b> <b>suite_folder/</b>)

       ○   <b>$BATS_SUITE_TMPDIR</b> is a temporary directory common to all tests of a suite. Could be used  to  create
           files required by multiple tests.

       ○   <b>$BATS_FILE_TMPDIR</b>  is  a  temporary  directory  common  to all tests of a test file. Could be used to
           create files required by multiple tests in the same test file.

       ○   <b>$BATS_TEST_TMPDIR</b> is a temporary directory unique for each  test.  Could  be  used  to  create  files
           required only for specific tests.

       ○   <b>$BATS_VERSION</b> is the version of Bats running the test.
