</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       go - tool for managing Go source code

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  ‘go  test’  command  expects to find test, benchmark, and example functions in the "*_test.go" files
       corresponding to the package under test.

       A test function is one named TestXxx (where Xxx does not start with a lower case letter) and should  have
       the signature,

             func TestXxx(t *testing.T) { ... }

       A benchmark function is one named BenchmarkXxx and should have the signature,

             func BenchmarkXxx(b *testing.B) { ... }

       A fuzz test is one named FuzzXxx and should have the signature,

             func FuzzXxx(f *testing.F) { ... }

       An  example  function is similar to a test function but, instead of using *testing.T to report success or
       failure, prints output to os.Stdout.  If the last comment in the function starts with "Output:" then  the
       output  is  compared  exactly  against  the comment (see examples below). If the last comment begins with
       "Unordered output:" then the output is compared to the  comment,  however  the  order  of  the  lines  is
       ignored.  An  example  with  no  such comment is compiled but not executed. An example with no text after
       "Output:" is compiled, executed, and expected to produce no output.

       Godoc displays the body of ExampleXxx to demonstrate the use of the function, constant, or variable  Xxx.
       An  example  of a method M with receiver type T or *T is named ExampleT_M. There may be multiple examples
       for a given function, constant, or variable, distinguished by a trailing _xxx, where xxx is a suffix  not
       beginning with an upper case letter.

       Here is an example of an example:

             func ExamplePrintln() {
                 Println("The output of\nthis example.")
                 // Output: The output of
                 // this example.
             }

       Here is another example where the ordering of the output is ignored:

             func ExamplePerm() {
                 for _, value := range <a href="../man4/Perm.4.html">Perm</a>(4) {
                     fmt.Println(value)
                 }

                 // Unordered output: 4
                 // 2
                 // 1
                 // 3
                 // 0
             }

       The entire test file is presented as the example when it contains a single example function, at least one
       other function, type, variable, or constant declaration, and no tests, benchmarks, or fuzz tests.

       See the documentation of the testing package for more information.
