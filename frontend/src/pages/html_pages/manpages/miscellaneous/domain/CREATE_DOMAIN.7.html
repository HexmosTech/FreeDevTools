       CREATE_DOMAIN - define a new domain

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CREATE DOMAIN <u>name</u> [ AS ] <u>data_type</u>
           [ COLLATE <u>collation</u> ]
           [ DEFAULT <u>expression</u> ]
           [ <u>domain_constraint</u> [ ... ] ]

       where <u>domain_constraint</u> is:

       [ CONSTRAINT <u>constraint_name</u> ]
       { NOT NULL | NULL | CHECK (<u>expression</u>) }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>CREATE</b> <b>DOMAIN</b> creates a new domain. A domain is essentially a data type with optional constraints
       (restrictions on the allowed set of values). The user who defines a domain becomes its owner.

       If a schema name is given (for example, CREATE DOMAIN myschema.mydomain ...) then the domain is created
       in the specified schema. Otherwise it is created in the current schema. The domain name must be unique
       among the types and domains existing in its schema.

       Domains are useful for abstracting common constraints on fields into a single location for maintenance.
       For example, several tables might contain email address columns, all requiring the same CHECK constraint
       to verify the address syntax. Define a domain rather than setting up each table's constraint
       individually.

       To be able to create a domain, you must have USAGE privilege on the underlying type.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>name</u>
           The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a domain to be created.

       <u>data_type</u>
           The underlying data type of the domain. This can include array specifiers.

       <u>collation</u>
           An optional collation for the domain. If no collation is specified, the domain has the same collation
           behavior as its underlying data type. The underlying type must be collatable if COLLATE is specified.

       DEFAULT <u>expression</u>
           The DEFAULT clause specifies a default value for columns of the domain data type. The value is any
           variable-free expression (but subqueries are not allowed). The data type of the default expression
           must match the data type of the domain. If no default value is specified, then the default value is
           the null value.

           The default expression will be used in any insert operation that does not specify a value for the
           column. If a default value is defined for a particular column, it overrides any default associated
           with the domain. In turn, the domain default overrides any default value associated with the
           underlying data type.

       CONSTRAINT <u>constraint_name</u>
           An optional name for a constraint. If not specified, the system generates a name.

       NOT NULL
           Values of this domain are prevented from being null (but see notes below).

       NULL
           Values of this domain are allowed to be null. This is the default.

           This clause is only intended for compatibility with nonstandard SQL databases. Its use is discouraged
           in new applications.

       CHECK (<u>expression</u>)
           CHECK clauses specify integrity constraints or tests which values of the domain must satisfy. Each
           constraint must be an expression producing a Boolean result. It should use the key word VALUE to
           refer to the value being tested. Expressions evaluating to TRUE or UNKNOWN succeed. If the expression
           produces a FALSE result, an error is reported and the value is not allowed to be converted to the
           domain type.

           Currently, CHECK expressions cannot contain subqueries nor refer to variables other than VALUE.

           When a domain has multiple CHECK constraints, they will be tested in alphabetical order by name.
           (PostgreSQL versions before 9.5 did not honor any particular firing order for CHECK constraints.)

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Domain constraints, particularly NOT NULL, are checked when converting a value to the domain type. It is
       possible for a column that is nominally of the domain type to read as null despite there being such a
       constraint. For example, this can happen in an outer-join query, if the domain column is on the nullable
       side of the outer join. A more subtle example is

           INSERT INTO tab (domcol) VALUES ((SELECT domcol FROM tab WHERE false));

       The empty scalar sub-SELECT will produce a null value that is considered to be of the domain type, so no
       further constraint checking is applied to it, and the insertion will succeed.

       It is very difficult to avoid such problems, because of SQL's general assumption that a null value is a
       valid value of every data type. Best practice therefore is to design a domain's constraints so that a
       null value is allowed, and then to apply column NOT NULL constraints to columns of the domain type as
       needed, rather than directly to the domain type.

       PostgreSQL assumes that CHECK constraints' conditions are immutable, that is, they will always give the
       same result for the same input value. This assumption is what justifies examining CHECK constraints only
       when a value is first converted to be of a domain type, and not at other times. (This is essentially the
       same as the treatment of table CHECK constraints, as described in Section 5.5.1.)

       An example of a common way to break this assumption is to reference a user-defined function in a CHECK
       expression, and then change the behavior of that function.  PostgreSQL does not disallow that, but it
       will not notice if there are stored values of the domain type that now violate the CHECK constraint. That
       would cause a subsequent database dump and restore to fail. The recommended way to handle such a change
       is to drop the constraint (using <b>ALTER</b> <b>DOMAIN</b>), adjust the function definition, and re-add the
       constraint, thereby rechecking it against stored data.

       It's also good practice to ensure that domain CHECK expressions will not throw errors.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This example creates the us_postal_code data type and then uses the type in a table definition. A regular
       expression test is used to verify that the value looks like a valid US postal code:

           CREATE DOMAIN us_postal_code AS TEXT
           CHECK(
              VALUE ~ '^\d{5}$'
           OR VALUE ~ '^\d{5}-\d{4}$'
           );

           CREATE TABLE us_snail_addy (
             address_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
             street1 TEXT NOT NULL,
             street2 TEXT,
             street3 TEXT,
             city TEXT NOT NULL,
             postal us_postal_code NOT NULL
           );

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The command <b>CREATE</b> <b>DOMAIN</b> conforms to the SQL standard.

       The syntax NOT NULL in this command is a PostgreSQL extension. (A standard-conforming way to write the
       same for non-composite data types would be CHECK (VALUE IS NOT NULL). However, per the section called
       “NOTES”, such constraints are best avoided in practice anyway.) The NULL “constraint” is a PostgreSQL
       extension (see also Compatibility).
