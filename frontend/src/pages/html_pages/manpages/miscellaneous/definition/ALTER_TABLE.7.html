</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b> changes the definition of an existing table. There are several subforms described below. Note
       that the lock level required may differ for each subform. An ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock is acquired unless
       explicitly noted. When multiple subcommands are given, the lock acquired will be the strictest one
       required by any subcommand.

       ADD COLUMN [ IF NOT EXISTS ]
           This form adds a new column to the table, using the same syntax as <b>CREATE</b> <b>TABLE</b>. If IF NOT EXISTS is
           specified and a column already exists with this name, no error is thrown.

       DROP COLUMN [ IF EXISTS ]
           This form drops a column from a table. Indexes and table constraints involving the column will be
           automatically dropped as well. Multivariate statistics referencing the dropped column will also be
           removed if the removal of the column would cause the statistics to contain data for only a single
           column. You will need to say CASCADE if anything outside the table depends on the column, for
           example, foreign key references or views. If IF EXISTS is specified and the column does not exist, no
           error is thrown. In this case a notice is issued instead.

       SET DATA TYPE
           This form changes the type of a column of a table. Indexes and simple table constraints involving the
           column will be automatically converted to use the new column type by reparsing the originally
           supplied expression. The optional COLLATE clause specifies a collation for the new column; if
           omitted, the collation is the default for the new column type. The optional USING clause specifies
           how to compute the new column value from the old; if omitted, the default conversion is the same as
           an assignment cast from old data type to new. A USING clause must be provided if there is no implicit
           or assignment cast from old to new type.

           When this form is used, the column's statistics are removed, so running <b>ANALYZE</b> on the table
           afterwards is recommended.

       SET/DROP DEFAULT
           These forms set or remove the default value for a column (where removal is equivalent to setting the
           default value to NULL). The new default value will only apply in subsequent <b>INSERT</b> or <b>UPDATE</b>
           commands; it does not cause rows already in the table to change.

       SET/DROP NOT NULL
           These forms change whether a column is marked to allow null values or to reject null values.

           SET NOT NULL may only be applied to a column provided none of the records in the table contain a NULL
           value for the column. Ordinarily this is checked during the ALTER TABLE by scanning the entire table;
           however, if a valid CHECK constraint is found which proves no NULL can exist, then the table scan is
           skipped.

           If this table is a partition, one cannot perform DROP NOT NULL on a column if it is marked NOT NULL
           in the parent table. To drop the NOT NULL constraint from all the partitions, perform DROP NOT NULL
           on the parent table. Even if there is no NOT NULL constraint on the parent, such a constraint can
           still be added to individual partitions, if desired; that is, the children can disallow nulls even if
           the parent allows them, but not the other way around.

       SET EXPRESSION AS
           This form replaces the expression of a generated column. Existing data in the column is rewritten and
           all the future changes will apply the new generation expression.

       DROP EXPRESSION [ IF EXISTS ]
           This form turns a stored generated column into a normal base column. Existing data in the columns is
           retained, but future changes will no longer apply the generation expression.

           If DROP EXPRESSION IF EXISTS is specified and the column is not a stored generated column, no error
           is thrown. In this case a notice is issued instead.

       ADD GENERATED { ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT } AS IDENTITY
       SET GENERATED { ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT }
       DROP IDENTITY [ IF EXISTS ]
           These forms change whether a column is an identity column or change the generation attribute of an
           existing identity column. See <b>CREATE</b> <b>TABLE</b> for details. Like SET DEFAULT, these forms only affect the
           behavior of subsequent <b>INSERT</b> and <b>UPDATE</b> commands; they do not cause rows already in the table to
           change.

           If DROP IDENTITY IF EXISTS is specified and the column is not an identity column, no error is thrown.
           In this case a notice is issued instead.

       SET <u>sequence_option</u>
       RESTART
           These forms alter the sequence that underlies an existing identity column.  <u>sequence_option</u> is an
           option supported by <b>ALTER</b> <b>SEQUENCE</b> such as INCREMENT BY.

       SET STATISTICS
           This form sets the per-column statistics-gathering target for subsequent <b>ANALYZE</b> operations. The
           target can be set in the range 0 to 10000. Set it to DEFAULT to revert to using the system default
           statistics target (default_statistics_target). (Setting to a value of -1 is an obsolete way spelling
           to get the same outcome.) For more information on the use of statistics by the PostgreSQL query
           planner, refer to Section 14.2.

           SET STATISTICS acquires a SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock.

       SET ( <u>attribute_option</u> = <u>value</u> [, ... ] )
       RESET ( <u>attribute_option</u> [, ... ] )
           This form sets or resets per-attribute options. Currently, the only defined per-attribute options are
           n_distinct and n_distinct_inherited, which override the number-of-distinct-values estimates made by
           subsequent <b>ANALYZE</b> operations.  n_distinct affects the statistics for the table itself, while
           n_distinct_inherited affects the statistics gathered for the table plus its inheritance children.
           When set to a positive value, <b>ANALYZE</b> will assume that the column contains exactly the specified
           number of distinct nonnull values. When set to a negative value, which must be greater than or equal
           to -1, <b>ANALYZE</b> will assume that the number of distinct nonnull values in the column is linear in the
           size of the table; the exact count is to be computed by multiplying the estimated table size by the
           absolute value of the given number. For example, a value of -1 implies that all values in the column
           are distinct, while a value of -0.5 implies that each value appears twice on the average. This can be
           useful when the size of the table changes over time, since the multiplication by the number of rows
           in the table is not performed until query planning time. Specify a value of 0 to revert to estimating
           the number of distinct values normally. For more information on the use of statistics by the
           PostgreSQL query planner, refer to Section 14.2.

           Changing per-attribute options acquires a SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock.

       SET STORAGE { PLAIN | EXTERNAL | EXTENDED | MAIN | DEFAULT }
           This form sets the storage mode for a column. This controls whether this column is held inline or in
           a secondary TOAST table, and whether the data should be compressed or not.  PLAIN must be used for
           fixed-length values such as integer and is inline, uncompressed.  MAIN is for inline, compressible
           data.  EXTERNAL is for external, uncompressed data, and EXTENDED is for external, compressed data.
           Writing DEFAULT sets the storage mode to the default mode for the column's data type.  EXTENDED is
           the default for most data types that support non-PLAIN storage. Use of EXTERNAL will make substring
           operations on very large text and bytea values run faster, at the penalty of increased storage space.
           Note that ALTER TABLE ... SET STORAGE doesn't itself change anything in the table; it just sets the
           strategy to be pursued during future table updates. See Section 65.2 for more information.

       SET COMPRESSION <u>compression_method</u>
           This form sets the compression method for a column, determining how values inserted in future will be
           compressed (if the storage mode permits compression at all). This does not cause the table to be
           rewritten, so existing data may still be compressed with other compression methods. If the table is
           restored with pg_restore, then all values are rewritten with the configured compression method.
           However, when data is inserted from another relation (for example, by <b>INSERT</b> <b>...</b> <b>SELECT</b>), values from
           the source table are not necessarily detoasted, so any previously compressed data may retain its
           existing compression method, rather than being recompressed with the compression method of the target
           column. The supported compression methods are pglz and lz4. (lz4 is available only if <b>--with-lz4</b> was
           used when building PostgreSQL.) In addition, <u>compression_method</u> can be default, which selects the
           default behavior of consulting the default_toast_compression setting at the time of data insertion to
           determine the method to use.

       ADD <u>table_constraint</u> [ NOT VALID ]
           This form adds a new constraint to a table using the same constraint syntax as <b>CREATE</b> <b>TABLE</b>, plus the
           option NOT VALID, which is currently only allowed for foreign key and CHECK constraints.

           Normally, this form will cause a scan of the table to verify that all existing rows in the table
           satisfy the new constraint. But if the NOT VALID option is used, this potentially-lengthy scan is
           skipped. The constraint will still be enforced against subsequent inserts or updates (that is,
           they'll fail unless there is a matching row in the referenced table, in the case of foreign keys, or
           they'll fail unless the new row matches the specified check condition). But the database will not
           assume that the constraint holds for all rows in the table, until it is validated by using the
           VALIDATE CONSTRAINT option. See Notes below for more information about using the NOT VALID option.

           Although most forms of ADD <u>table_constraint</u> require an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock, ADD FOREIGN KEY
           requires only a SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE lock. Note that ADD FOREIGN KEY also acquires a SHARE ROW
           EXCLUSIVE lock on the referenced table, in addition to the lock on the table on which the constraint
           is declared.

           Additional restrictions apply when unique or primary key constraints are added to partitioned tables;
           see <b>CREATE</b> <b>TABLE</b>. Also, foreign key constraints on partitioned tables may not be declared NOT VALID
           at present.

       ADD <u>table_constraint_using_index</u>
           This form adds a new PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint to a table based on an existing unique index.
           All the columns of the index will be included in the constraint.

           The index cannot have expression columns nor be a partial index. Also, it must be a b-tree index with
           default sort ordering. These restrictions ensure that the index is equivalent to one that would be
           built by a regular ADD PRIMARY KEY or ADD UNIQUE command.

           If PRIMARY KEY is specified, and the index's columns are not already marked NOT NULL, then this
           command will attempt to do ALTER COLUMN SET NOT NULL against each such column. That requires a full
           table scan to verify the column(s) contain no nulls. In all other cases, this is a fast operation.

           If a constraint name is provided then the index will be renamed to match the constraint name.
           Otherwise the constraint will be named the same as the index.

           After this command is executed, the index is “owned” by the constraint, in the same way as if the
           index had been built by a regular ADD PRIMARY KEY or ADD UNIQUE command. In particular, dropping the
           constraint will make the index disappear too.

           This form is not currently supported on partitioned tables.

               <b>Note</b>
               Adding a constraint using an existing index can be helpful in situations where a new constraint
               needs to be added without blocking table updates for a long time. To do that, create the index
               using <b>CREATE</b> <b>UNIQUE</b> <b>INDEX</b> <b>CONCURRENTLY</b>, and then convert it to a constraint using this syntax.
               See the example below.

       ALTER CONSTRAINT
           This form alters the attributes of a constraint that was previously created. Currently only foreign
           key constraints may be altered.

       VALIDATE CONSTRAINT
           This form validates a foreign key or check constraint that was previously created as NOT VALID, by
           scanning the table to ensure there are no rows for which the constraint is not satisfied. Nothing
           happens if the constraint is already marked valid. (See Notes below for an explanation of the
           usefulness of this command.)

           This command acquires a SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock.

       DROP CONSTRAINT [ IF EXISTS ]
           This form drops the specified constraint on a table, along with any index underlying the constraint.
           If IF EXISTS is specified and the constraint does not exist, no error is thrown. In this case a
           notice is issued instead.

       DISABLE/ENABLE [ REPLICA | ALWAYS ] TRIGGER
           These forms configure the firing of trigger(s) belonging to the table. A disabled trigger is still
           known to the system, but is not executed when its triggering event occurs. (For a deferred trigger,
           the enable status is checked when the event occurs, not when the trigger function is actually
           executed.) One can disable or enable a single trigger specified by name, or all triggers on the
           table, or only user triggers (this option excludes internally generated constraint triggers, such as
           those that are used to implement foreign key constraints or deferrable uniqueness and exclusion
           constraints). Disabling or enabling internally generated constraint triggers requires superuser
           privileges; it should be done with caution since of course the integrity of the constraint cannot be
           guaranteed if the triggers are not executed.

           The trigger firing mechanism is also affected by the configuration variable session_replication_role.
           Simply enabled triggers (the default) will fire when the replication role is “origin” (the default)
           or “local”. Triggers configured as ENABLE REPLICA will only fire if the session is in “replica” mode,
           and triggers configured as ENABLE ALWAYS will fire regardless of the current replication role.

           The effect of this mechanism is that in the default configuration, triggers do not fire on replicas.
           This is useful because if a trigger is used on the origin to propagate data between tables, then the
           replication system will also replicate the propagated data; so the trigger should not fire a second
           time on the replica, because that would lead to duplication. However, if a trigger is used for
           another purpose such as creating external alerts, then it might be appropriate to set it to ENABLE
           ALWAYS so that it is also fired on replicas.

           When this command is applied to a partitioned table, the states of corresponding clone triggers in
           the partitions are updated too, unless ONLY is specified.

           This command acquires a SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE lock.

       DISABLE/ENABLE [ REPLICA | ALWAYS ] RULE
           These forms configure the firing of rewrite rules belonging to the table. A disabled rule is still
           known to the system, but is not applied during query rewriting. The semantics are as for
           disabled/enabled triggers. This configuration is ignored for ON SELECT rules, which are always
           applied in order to keep views working even if the current session is in a non-default replication
           role.

           The rule firing mechanism is also affected by the configuration variable session_replication_role,
           analogous to triggers as described above.

       DISABLE/ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY
           These forms control the application of row security policies belonging to the table. If enabled and
           no policies exist for the table, then a default-deny policy is applied. Note that policies can exist
           for a table even if row-level security is disabled. In this case, the policies will <u>not</u> be applied
           and the policies will be ignored. See also <b>CREATE</b> <b>POLICY</b>.

       NO FORCE/FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY
           These forms control the application of row security policies belonging to the table when the user is
           the table owner. If enabled, row-level security policies will be applied when the user is the table
           owner. If disabled (the default) then row-level security will not be applied when the user is the
           table owner. See also <b>CREATE</b> <b>POLICY</b>.

       CLUSTER ON
           This form selects the default index for future <b>CLUSTER</b> operations. It does not actually re-cluster
           the table.

           Changing cluster options acquires a SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock.

       SET WITHOUT CLUSTER
           This form removes the most recently used <b>CLUSTER</b> index specification from the table. This affects
           future cluster operations that don't specify an index.

           Changing cluster options acquires a SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock.

       SET WITHOUT OIDS
           Backward-compatible syntax for removing the oid system column. As oid system columns cannot be added
           anymore, this never has an effect.

       SET ACCESS METHOD
           This form changes the access method of the table by rewriting it using the indicated access method;
           specifying DEFAULT selects the access method set as the default_table_access_method configuration
           parameter. See Chapter 61 for more information.

           When applied to a partitioned table, there is no data to rewrite, but partitions created afterwards
           will default to the given access method unless overridden by a USING clause. Specifying <u>DEFAULT</u>
           removes a previous value, causing future partitions to default to <u>default_table_access_method</u>.

       SET TABLESPACE
           This form changes the table's tablespace to the specified tablespace and moves the data file(s)
           associated with the table to the new tablespace. Indexes on the table, if any, are not moved; but
           they can be moved separately with additional SET TABLESPACE commands. When applied to a partitioned
           table, nothing is moved, but any partitions created afterwards with <b>CREATE</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>PARTITION</b> <b>OF</b> will
           use that tablespace, unless overridden by a TABLESPACE clause.

           All tables in the current database in a tablespace can be moved by using the ALL IN TABLESPACE form,
           which will lock all tables to be moved first and then move each one. This form also supports OWNED
           BY, which will only move tables owned by the roles specified. If the NOWAIT option is specified then
           the command will fail if it is unable to acquire all of the locks required immediately. Note that
           system catalogs are not moved by this command; use <b>ALTER</b> <b>DATABASE</b> or explicit <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b> invocations
           instead if desired. The information_schema relations are not considered part of the system catalogs
           and will be moved. See also <b>CREATE</b> <b>TABLESPACE</b>.

       SET { LOGGED | UNLOGGED }
           This form changes the table from unlogged to logged or vice-versa (see UNLOGGED). It cannot be
           applied to a temporary table.

           This also changes the persistence of any sequences linked to the table (for identity or serial
           columns). However, it is also possible to change the persistence of such sequences separately.

       SET ( <u>storage_parameter</u> [= <u>value</u>] [, ... ] )
           This form changes one or more storage parameters for the table. See Storage Parameters in the <b>CREATE</b>
           <b>TABLE</b> documentation for details on the available parameters. Note that the table contents will not be
           modified immediately by this command; depending on the parameter you might need to rewrite the table
           to get the desired effects. That can be done with <b>VACUUM</b> <b>FULL</b>, <b>CLUSTER</b> or one of the forms of <b>ALTER</b>
           <b>TABLE</b> that forces a table rewrite. For planner related parameters, changes will take effect from the
           next time the table is locked so currently executing queries will not be affected.

           SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock will be taken for fillfactor, toast and autovacuum storage parameters, as
           well as the planner parameter <u>parallel_workers</u>.

       RESET ( <u>storage_parameter</u> [, ... ] )
           This form resets one or more storage parameters to their defaults. As with SET, a table rewrite might
           be needed to update the table entirely.

       INHERIT <u>parent_table</u>
           This form adds the target table as a new child of the specified parent table. Subsequently, queries
           against the parent will include records of the target table. To be added as a child, the target table
           must already contain all the same columns as the parent (it could have additional columns, too). The
           columns must have matching data types, and if they have NOT NULL constraints in the parent then they
           must also have NOT NULL constraints in the child.

           There must also be matching child-table constraints for all CHECK constraints of the parent, except
           those marked non-inheritable (that is, created with ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... NO INHERIT) in
           the parent, which are ignored; all child-table constraints matched must not be marked
           non-inheritable. Currently UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, and FOREIGN KEY constraints are not considered, but
           this might change in the future.

       NO INHERIT <u>parent_table</u>
           This form removes the target table from the list of children of the specified parent table. Queries
           against the parent table will no longer include records drawn from the target table.

       OF <u>type_name</u>
           This form links the table to a composite type as though <b>CREATE</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>OF</b> had formed it. The table's
           list of column names and types must precisely match that of the composite type. The table must not
           inherit from any other table. These restrictions ensure that <b>CREATE</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>OF</b> would permit an
           equivalent table definition.

       NOT OF
           This form dissociates a typed table from its type.

       OWNER TO
           This form changes the owner of the table, sequence, view, materialized view, or foreign table to the
           specified user.

       REPLICA IDENTITY
           This form changes the information which is written to the write-ahead log to identify rows which are
           updated or deleted. In most cases, the old value of each column is only logged if it differs from the
           new value; however, if the old value is stored externally, it is always logged regardless of whether
           it changed. This option has no effect except when logical replication is in use.

           DEFAULT
               Records the old values of the columns of the primary key, if any. This is the default for
               non-system tables.

           USING INDEX <u>index_name</u>
               Records the old values of the columns covered by the named index, that must be unique, not
               partial, not deferrable, and include only columns marked NOT NULL. If this index is dropped, the
               behavior is the same as NOTHING.

           FULL
               Records the old values of all columns in the row.

           NOTHING
               Records no information about the old row. This is the default for system tables.

       RENAME
           The RENAME forms change the name of a table (or an index, sequence, view, materialized view, or
           foreign table), the name of an individual column in a table, or the name of a constraint of the
           table. When renaming a constraint that has an underlying index, the index is renamed as well. There
           is no effect on the stored data.

       SET SCHEMA
           This form moves the table into another schema. Associated indexes, constraints, and sequences owned
           by table columns are moved as well.

       ATTACH PARTITION <u>partition_name</u> { FOR VALUES <u>partition_bound_spec</u> | DEFAULT }
           This form attaches an existing table (which might itself be partitioned) as a partition of the target
           table. The table can be attached as a partition for specific values using FOR VALUES or as a default
           partition by using DEFAULT. For each index in the target table, a corresponding one will be created
           in the attached table; or, if an equivalent index already exists, it will be attached to the target
           table's index, as if <b>ALTER</b> <b>INDEX</b> <b>ATTACH</b> <b>PARTITION</b> had been executed. Note that if the existing table
           is a foreign table, it is currently not allowed to attach the table as a partition of the target
           table if there are UNIQUE indexes on the target table. (See also CREATE FOREIGN TABLE
           (<b><a href="../man7/CREATE_FOREIGN_TABLE.7.html">CREATE_FOREIGN_TABLE</a></b>(7)).) For each user-defined row-level trigger that exists in the target table,
           a corresponding one is created in the attached table.

           A partition using FOR VALUES uses same syntax for <u>partition_bound_spec</u> as <b>CREATE</b> <b>TABLE</b>. The partition
           bound specification must correspond to the partitioning strategy and partition key of the target
           table. The table to be attached must have all the same columns as the target table and no more;
           moreover, the column types must also match. Also, it must have all the NOT NULL and CHECK constraints
           of the target table, not marked NO INHERIT. Currently FOREIGN KEY constraints are not considered.
           UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints from the parent table will be created in the partition, if they
           don't already exist.

           If the new partition is a regular table, a full table scan is performed to check that existing rows
           in the table do not violate the partition constraint. It is possible to avoid this scan by adding a
           valid CHECK constraint to the table that allows only rows satisfying the desired partition constraint
           before running this command. The CHECK constraint will be used to determine that the table need not
           be scanned to validate the partition constraint. This does not work, however, if any of the partition
           keys is an expression and the partition does not accept NULL values. If attaching a list partition
           that will not accept NULL values, also add a NOT NULL constraint to the partition key column, unless
           it's an expression.

           If the new partition is a foreign table, nothing is done to verify that all the rows in the foreign
           table obey the partition constraint. (See the discussion in CREATE FOREIGN TABLE
           (<b><a href="../man7/CREATE_FOREIGN_TABLE.7.html">CREATE_FOREIGN_TABLE</a></b>(7)) about constraints on the foreign table.)

           When a table has a default partition, defining a new partition changes the partition constraint for
           the default partition. The default partition can't contain any rows that would need to be moved to
           the new partition, and will be scanned to verify that none are present. This scan, like the scan of
           the new partition, can be avoided if an appropriate CHECK constraint is present. Also like the scan
           of the new partition, it is always skipped when the default partition is a foreign table.

           Attaching a partition acquires a SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock on the parent table, in addition to the
           ACCESS EXCLUSIVE locks on the table being attached and on the default partition (if any).

           Further locks must also be held on all sub-partitions if the table being attached is itself a
           partitioned table. Likewise if the default partition is itself a partitioned table. The locking of
           the sub-partitions can be avoided by adding a CHECK constraint as described in Section 5.12.2.2.

       DETACH PARTITION <u>partition_name</u> [ CONCURRENTLY | FINALIZE ]
           This form detaches the specified partition of the target table. The detached partition continues to
           exist as a standalone table, but no longer has any ties to the table from which it was detached. Any
           indexes that were attached to the target table's indexes are detached. Any triggers that were created
           as clones of those in the target table are removed.  SHARE lock is obtained on any tables that
           reference this partitioned table in foreign key constraints.

           If CONCURRENTLY is specified, it runs using a reduced lock level to avoid blocking other sessions
           that might be accessing the partitioned table. In this mode, two transactions are used internally.
           During the first transaction, a SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock is taken on both parent table and
           partition, and the partition is marked as undergoing detach; at that point, the transaction is
           committed and all other transactions using the partitioned table are waited for. Once all those
           transactions have completed, the second transaction acquires SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE on the
           partitioned table and ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on the partition, and the detach process completes. A CHECK
           constraint that duplicates the partition constraint is added to the partition.  CONCURRENTLY cannot
           be run in a transaction block and is not allowed if the partitioned table contains a default
           partition.

           If FINALIZE is specified, a previous DETACH CONCURRENTLY invocation that was canceled or interrupted
           is completed. At most one partition in a partitioned table can be pending detach at a time.

       All the forms of ALTER TABLE that act on a single table, except RENAME, SET SCHEMA, ATTACH PARTITION, and
       DETACH PARTITION can be combined into a list of multiple alterations to be applied together. For example,
       it is possible to add several columns and/or alter the type of several columns in a single command. This
       is particularly useful with large tables, since only one pass over the table need be made.

       You must own the table to use <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b>. To change the schema or tablespace of a table, you must also
       have CREATE privilege on the new schema or tablespace. To add the table as a new child of a parent table,
       you must own the parent table as well. Also, to attach a table as a new partition of the table, you must
       own the table being attached. To alter the owner, you must be able to SET ROLE to the new owning role,
       and that role must have CREATE privilege on the table's schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering
       the owner doesn't do anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the table. However, a superuser
       can alter ownership of any table anyway.) To add a column or alter a column type or use the OF clause,
       you must also have USAGE privilege on the data type.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>

           The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table to alter. If ONLY is specified before the
           table name, only that table is altered. If ONLY is not specified, the table and all its descendant
           tables (if any) are altered. Optionally, * can be specified after the table name to explicitly
           indicate that descendant tables are included.

           Name of a single trigger to disable or enable.

       ALL
           Disable or enable all triggers belonging to the table. (This requires superuser privilege if any of
           the triggers are internally generated constraint triggers, such as those that are used to implement
           foreign key constraints or deferrable uniqueness and exclusion constraints.)

       USER
           Disable or enable all triggers belonging to the table except for internally generated constraint
           triggers, such as those that are used to implement foreign key constraints or deferrable uniqueness

       <u>partition_bound_spec</u>
           The partition bound specification for a new partition. Refer to CREATE TABLE (<b><a href="../man7/CREATE_TABLE.7.html">CREATE_TABLE</a></b>(7)) for
           more details on the syntax of the same.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The key word COLUMN is noise and can be omitted.

       When a column is added with ADD COLUMN and a non-volatile DEFAULT is specified, the default is evaluated
       at the time of the statement and the result stored in the table's metadata. That value will be used for
       the column for all existing rows. If no DEFAULT is specified, NULL is used. In neither case is a rewrite
       of the table required.

       Adding a column with a volatile DEFAULT or changing the type of an existing column will require the
       entire table and its indexes to be rewritten. As an exception, when changing the type of an existing
       column, if the USING clause does not change the column contents and the old type is either binary
       coercible to the new type or an unconstrained domain over the new type, a table rewrite is not needed.
       However, indexes must always be rebuilt unless the system can verify that the new index would be
       logically equivalent to the existing one. For example, if the collation for a column has been changed, an
       index rebuild is always required because the new sort order might be different. However, in the absence
       of a collation change, a column can be changed from text to varchar (or vice versa) without rebuilding
       the indexes because these data types sort identically. Table and/or index rebuilds may take a significant
       amount of time for a large table; and will temporarily require as much as double the disk space.

       Adding a CHECK or NOT NULL constraint requires scanning the table to verify that existing rows meet the
       constraint, but does not require a table rewrite.

       Similarly, when attaching a new partition it may be scanned to verify that existing rows meet the
       partition constraint.

       The main reason for providing the option to specify multiple changes in a single <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b> is that
       multiple table scans or rewrites can thereby be combined into a single pass over the table.

       Scanning a large table to verify a new foreign key or check constraint can take a long time, and other
       updates to the table are locked out until the <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>ADD</b> <b>CONSTRAINT</b> command is committed. The main
       purpose of the NOT VALID constraint option is to reduce the impact of adding a constraint on concurrent
       updates. With NOT VALID, the <b>ADD</b> <b>CONSTRAINT</b> command does not scan the table and can be committed
       immediately. After that, a VALIDATE CONSTRAINT command can be issued to verify that existing rows satisfy
       the constraint. The validation step does not need to lock out concurrent updates, since it knows that
       other transactions will be enforcing the constraint for rows that they insert or update; only
       pre-existing rows need to be checked. Hence, validation acquires only a SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock on
       the table being altered. (If the constraint is a foreign key then a ROW SHARE lock is also required on
       the table referenced by the constraint.) In addition to improving concurrency, it can be useful to use
       NOT VALID and VALIDATE CONSTRAINT in cases where the table is known to contain pre-existing violations.
       Once the constraint is in place, no new violations can be inserted, and the existing problems can be
       corrected at leisure until VALIDATE CONSTRAINT finally succeeds.

       The DROP COLUMN form does not physically remove the column, but simply makes it invisible to SQL
       operations. Subsequent insert and update operations in the table will store a null value for the column.
       Thus, dropping a column is quick but it will not immediately reduce the on-disk size of your table, as
       the space occupied by the dropped column is not reclaimed. The space will be reclaimed over time as
       existing rows are updated.

       To force immediate reclamation of space occupied by a dropped column, you can execute one of the forms of
       <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b> that performs a rewrite of the whole table. This results in reconstructing each row with the
       dropped column replaced by a null value.

       The rewriting forms of <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b> are not MVCC-safe. After a table rewrite, the table will appear empty
       to concurrent transactions, if they are using a snapshot taken before the rewrite occurred. See
       Section 13.6 for more details.

       The USING option of SET DATA TYPE can actually specify any expression involving the old values of the
       row; that is, it can refer to other columns as well as the one being converted. This allows very general
       conversions to be done with the SET DATA TYPE syntax. Because of this flexibility, the USING expression
       is not applied to the column's default value (if any); the result might not be a constant expression as
       required for a default. This means that when there is no implicit or assignment cast from old to new
       type, SET DATA TYPE might fail to convert the default even though a USING clause is supplied. In such
       cases, drop the default with DROP DEFAULT, perform the ALTER TYPE, and then use SET DEFAULT to add a
       suitable new default. Similar considerations apply to indexes and constraints involving the column.

       If a table has any descendant tables, it is not permitted to add, rename, or change the type of a column
       in the parent table without doing the same to the descendants. This ensures that the descendants always
       have columns matching the parent. Similarly, a CHECK constraint cannot be renamed in the parent without
       also renaming it in all descendants, so that CHECK constraints also match between the parent and its
       descendants. (That restriction does not apply to index-based constraints, however.) Also, because
       selecting from the parent also selects from its descendants, a constraint on the parent cannot be marked
       valid unless it is also marked valid for those descendants. In all of these cases, <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>ONLY</b> will
       be rejected.

       A recursive DROP COLUMN operation will remove a descendant table's column only if the descendant does not
       inherit that column from any other parents and never had an independent definition of the column. A
       nonrecursive DROP COLUMN (i.e., <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>ONLY</b> <b>...</b> <b>DROP</b> <b>COLUMN</b>) never removes any descendant columns,
       but instead marks them as independently defined rather than inherited. A nonrecursive DROP COLUMN command
       will fail for a partitioned table, because all partitions of a table must have the same columns as the
       partitioning root.

       The actions for identity columns (ADD GENERATED, SET etc., DROP IDENTITY), as well as the actions
       CLUSTER, OWNER, and TABLESPACE never recurse to descendant tables; that is, they always act as though
       ONLY were specified. Actions affecting trigger states recurse to partitions of partitioned tables (unless
       ONLY is specified), but never to traditional-inheritance descendants. Adding a constraint recurses only
       for CHECK constraints that are not marked NO INHERIT.

       Changing any part of a system catalog table is not permitted.

       Refer to CREATE TABLE (<b><a href="../man7/CREATE_TABLE.7.html">CREATE_TABLE</a></b>(7)) for a further description of valid parameters.  Chapter 5 has
       further information on inheritance.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To add a column of type varchar to a table:

           ALTER TABLE distributors ADD COLUMN address <a href="../man30/varchar.30.html">varchar</a>(30);

       That will cause all existing rows in the table to be filled with null values for the new column.

       To add a column with a non-null default:

           ALTER TABLE measurements
             ADD COLUMN mtime timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now();

       Existing rows will be filled with the current time as the value of the new column, and then new rows will
       receive the time of their insertion.

       To add a column and fill it with a value different from the default to be used later:

           ALTER TABLE transactions
             ADD COLUMN status <a href="../man30/varchar.30.html">varchar</a>(30) DEFAULT 'old',
             ALTER COLUMN status SET default 'current';

       Existing rows will be filled with old, but then the default for subsequent commands will be current. The
       effects are the same as if the two sub-commands had been issued in separate <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b> commands.

       To drop a column from a table:

           ALTER TABLE distributors DROP COLUMN address RESTRICT;

       To change the types of two existing columns in one operation:

           ALTER TABLE distributors
               ALTER COLUMN address TYPE <a href="../man80/varchar.80.html">varchar</a>(80),
               ALTER COLUMN name TYPE <a href="../man100/varchar.100.html">varchar</a>(100);

       To change an integer column containing Unix timestamps to timestamp with time zone via a USING clause:

           ALTER TABLE foo
               ALTER COLUMN foo_timestamp SET DATA TYPE timestamp with time zone
               USING
                   timestamp with time zone 'epoch' + foo_timestamp * interval '1 second';

       The same, when the column has a default expression that won't automatically cast to the new data type:

           ALTER TABLE foo
               ALTER COLUMN foo_timestamp DROP DEFAULT,
               ALTER COLUMN foo_timestamp TYPE timestamp with time zone
               USING
                   timestamp with time zone 'epoch' + foo_timestamp * interval '1 second',
               ALTER COLUMN foo_timestamp SET DEFAULT now();

       To rename an existing column:

           ALTER TABLE distributors RENAME COLUMN address TO city;

       To rename an existing table:

           ALTER TABLE distributors RENAME TO suppliers;

       To rename an existing constraint:

           ALTER TABLE distributors RENAME CONSTRAINT zipchk TO zip_check;

       To add a not-null constraint to a column:

           ALTER TABLE distributors ALTER COLUMN street SET NOT NULL;

       To remove a not-null constraint from a column:

           ALTER TABLE distributors ALTER COLUMN street DROP NOT NULL;

       To add a check constraint to a table and all its children:

           ALTER TABLE distributors ADD CONSTRAINT zipchk CHECK (char_length(zipcode) = 5);

       To add a check constraint only to a table and not to its children:

           ALTER TABLE distributors ADD CONSTRAINT zipchk CHECK (char_length(zipcode) = 5) NO INHERIT;

       (The check constraint will not be inherited by future children, either.)

       To remove a check constraint from a table and all its children:

           ALTER TABLE distributors DROP CONSTRAINT zipchk;

       To remove a check constraint from one table only:

           ALTER TABLE ONLY distributors DROP CONSTRAINT zipchk;

       (The check constraint remains in place for any child tables.)

       To add a foreign key constraint to a table:

           ALTER TABLE distributors ADD CONSTRAINT distfk FOREIGN KEY (address) REFERENCES addresses (address);

       To add a foreign key constraint to a table with the least impact on other work:

           ALTER TABLE distributors ADD CONSTRAINT distfk FOREIGN KEY (address) REFERENCES addresses (address) NOT VALID;
           ALTER TABLE distributors VALIDATE CONSTRAINT distfk;

       To add a (multicolumn) unique constraint to a table:

           ALTER TABLE distributors ADD CONSTRAINT dist_id_zipcode_key UNIQUE (dist_id, zipcode);

       To add an automatically named primary key constraint to a table, noting that a table can only ever have
       one primary key:

           ALTER TABLE distributors ADD PRIMARY KEY (dist_id);

       To move a table to a different tablespace:

           ALTER TABLE distributors SET TABLESPACE fasttablespace;

       To move a table to a different schema:

           ALTER TABLE myschema.distributors SET SCHEMA yourschema;

       To recreate a primary key constraint, without blocking updates while the index is rebuilt:

           CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY dist_id_temp_idx ON distributors (dist_id);
           ALTER TABLE distributors DROP CONSTRAINT distributors_pkey,
               ADD CONSTRAINT distributors_pkey PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX dist_id_temp_idx;

       To attach a partition to a range-partitioned table:

           ALTER TABLE measurement
               ATTACH PARTITION measurement_y2016m07 FOR VALUES FROM ('2016-07-01') TO ('2016-08-01');

       To attach a partition to a list-partitioned table:

           ALTER TABLE cities
               ATTACH PARTITION cities_ab FOR VALUES IN ('a', 'b');

       To attach a partition to a hash-partitioned table:

           ALTER TABLE orders
               ATTACH PARTITION orders_p4 FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);

       To attach a default partition to a partitioned table:

           ALTER TABLE cities
               ATTACH PARTITION cities_partdef DEFAULT;

       To detach a partition from a partitioned table:

           ALTER TABLE measurement
               DETACH PARTITION measurement_y2015m12;

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The forms ADD (without USING INDEX), DROP [COLUMN], DROP IDENTITY, RESTART, SET DEFAULT, SET DATA TYPE
       (without USING), SET GENERATED, and SET <u>sequence_option</u> conform with the SQL standard. The other forms
       are PostgreSQL extensions of the SQL standard. Also, the ability to specify more than one manipulation in
       a single <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b> command is an extension.

       <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>DROP</b> <b>COLUMN</b> can be used to drop the only column of a table, leaving a zero-column table. This
       is an extension of SQL, which disallows zero-column tables.
