           SET TABLESPACE <u>new_tablespace</u> [ NOWAIT ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ALTER</b> <b>INDEX</b> changes the definition of an existing index. There are several subforms described below. Note
       that the lock level required may differ for each subform. An ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock is held unless
       explicitly noted. When multiple subcommands are listed, the lock held will be the strictest one required
       from any subcommand.

       RENAME
           The RENAME form changes the name of the index. If the index is associated with a table constraint
           (either UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, or EXCLUDE), the constraint is renamed as well. There is no effect on
           the stored data.

           Renaming an index acquires a SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock.

       SET TABLESPACE
           This form changes the index's tablespace to the specified tablespace and moves the data file(s)
           associated with the index to the new tablespace. To change the tablespace of an index, you must own
           the index and have CREATE privilege on the new tablespace. All indexes in the current database in a
           tablespace can be moved by using the ALL IN TABLESPACE form, which will lock all indexes to be moved
           and then move each one. This form also supports OWNED BY, which will only move indexes owned by the
           roles specified. If the NOWAIT option is specified then the command will fail if it is unable to
           acquire all of the locks required immediately. Note that system catalogs will not be moved by this
           command, use <b>ALTER</b> <b>DATABASE</b> or explicit <b>ALTER</b> <b>INDEX</b> invocations instead if desired. See also <b>CREATE</b>
           <b>TABLESPACE</b>.

       ATTACH PARTITION <u>index_name</u>
           Causes the named index (possibly schema-qualified) to become attached to the altered index. The named
           index must be on a partition of the table containing the index being altered, and have an equivalent
           definition. An attached index cannot be dropped by itself, and will automatically be dropped if its
           parent index is dropped.

       DEPENDS ON EXTENSION <u>extension_name</u>
       NO DEPENDS ON EXTENSION <u>extension_name</u>
           This form marks the index as dependent on the extension, or no longer dependent on that extension if
           NO is specified. An index that's marked as dependent on an extension is automatically dropped when
           the extension is dropped.

       SET ( <u>storage_parameter</u> [= <u>value</u>] [, ... ] )
           This form changes one or more index-method-specific storage parameters for the index. See <b>CREATE</b>
           <b>INDEX</b> for details on the available parameters. Note that the index contents will not be modified
           immediately by this command; depending on the parameter you might need to rebuild the index with
           <b>REINDEX</b> to get the desired effects.

       RESET ( <u>storage_parameter</u> [, ... ] )
           This form resets one or more index-method-specific storage parameters to their defaults. As with SET,
           a REINDEX might be needed to update the index entirely.

       ALTER [ COLUMN ] <u>column_number</u> SET STATISTICS <u>integer</u>
           This form sets the per-column statistics-gathering target for subsequent <b>ANALYZE</b> operations, though
           can be used only on index columns that are defined as an expression. Since expressions lack a unique
           name, we refer to them using the ordinal number of the index column. The target can be set in the
           range 0 to 10000; alternatively, set it to -1 to revert to using the system default statistics target
           (default_statistics_target). For more information on the use of statistics by the PostgreSQL query
           planner, refer to Section 14.2.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       IF EXISTS
           Do not throw an error if the index does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

       <u>column_number</u>
           The ordinal number refers to the ordinal (left-to-right) position of the index column.

       <u>name</u>
           The name (possibly schema-qualified) of an existing index to alter.

       <u>new_name</u>
           The new name for the index.

       <u>tablespace_name</u>
           The tablespace to which the index will be moved.

       <u>extension_name</u>
           The name of the extension that the index is to depend on.

       <u>storage_parameter</u>
           The name of an index-method-specific storage parameter.

       <u>value</u>
           The new value for an index-method-specific storage parameter. This might be a number or a word
           depending on the parameter.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       These operations are also possible using <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b>.  <b>ALTER</b> <b>INDEX</b> is in fact just an alias for the forms
       of <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b> that apply to indexes.

       There was formerly an <b>ALTER</b> <b>INDEX</b> <b>OWNER</b> variant, but this is now ignored (with a warning). An index
       cannot have an owner different from its table's owner. Changing the table's owner automatically changes
       the index as well.

       Changing any part of a system catalog index is not permitted.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To rename an existing index:

           ALTER INDEX distributors RENAME TO suppliers;

       To move an index to a different tablespace:

           ALTER INDEX distributors SET TABLESPACE fasttablespace;

       To change an index's fill factor (assuming that the index method supports it):

           ALTER INDEX distributors SET (fillfactor = 75);
           REINDEX INDEX distributors;

       Set the statistics-gathering target for an expression index:

           CREATE INDEX coord_idx ON measured (x, y, (z + t));
           ALTER INDEX coord_idx ALTER COLUMN 3 SET STATISTICS 1000;

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ALTER</b> <b>INDEX</b> is a PostgreSQL extension.
