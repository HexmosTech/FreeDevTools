                unwieldy (for example, when used as an index).

                The usage of this textual convention implies that additional
                transport domains can only be supported by updating this MIB
                module. This extensibility restriction does not apply for the
                TransportDomain textual convention which allows MIB authors

           DESCRIPTION
               "Denotes a generic transport address.

                A TransportAddress value is always interpreted within the
                context of a TransportAddressType or TransportDomain value.
                Every usage of the TransportAddress textual convention MUST
                specify the TransportAddressType or TransportDomain object
                which provides the context. Furthermore, MIB authors SHOULD
                define a separate TransportAddressType or TransportDomain
                object for each TransportAddress object. It is suggested that
                the TransportAddressType or TransportDomain is logically
                registered before the object(s) which use the
                TransportAddress textual convention if they appear in the
                same logical row.

                The value of a TransportAddress object must always be
                consistent with the value of the associated
                TransportAddressType or TransportDomain object. Attempts
                to set a TransportAddress object to a value which is
                inconsistent with the associated TransportAddressType or
                TransportDomain must fail with an inconsistentValue error.

                When this textual convention is used as a syntax of an
                index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
                sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58. In this case,
                the OBJECT-TYPE declaration MUST include a 'SIZE' clause
                to limit the number of potential instance sub-identifiers."

                Values of this textual convention are not directly useable as
                transport-layer addressing information, and require runtime
                resolution. As such, applications that write them must be
                prepared for handling errors if such values are not
                supported, or cannot be resolved (if resolution occurs at the
                time of the management operation).

                The DESCRIPTION clause of TransportAddress objects that may
                have TransportAddressDns values must fully describe how (and
                when) such names are to be resolved to IP addresses and vice
                versa.
