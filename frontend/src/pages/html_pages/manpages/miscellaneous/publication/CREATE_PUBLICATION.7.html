       CREATE_PUBLICATION - define a new publication

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CREATE PUBLICATION <u>name</u>
           [ FOR ALL TABLES
             | FOR <u>publication_object</u> [, ... ] ]
           [ WITH ( <u>publication_parameter</u> [= <u>value</u>] [, ... ] ) ]

       where <u>publication_object</u> is one of:

           TABLE [ ONLY ] <u>table_name</u> [ * ] [ ( <u>column_name</u> [, ... ] ) ] [ WHERE ( <u>expression</u> ) ] [, ... ]
           TABLES IN SCHEMA { <u>schema_name</u> | CURRENT_SCHEMA } [, ... ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>CREATE</b> <b>PUBLICATION</b> adds a new publication into the current database. The publication name must be
       distinct from the name of any existing publication in the current database.

       A publication is essentially a group of tables whose data changes are intended to be replicated through
       logical replication. See Section 29.1 for details about how publications fit into the logical replication
       setup.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>name</u>
           The name of the new publication.

       FOR TABLE
           Specifies a list of tables to add to the publication. If ONLY is specified before the table name,
           only that table is added to the publication. If ONLY is not specified, the table and all its
           descendant tables (if any) are added. Optionally, * can be specified after the table name to
           explicitly indicate that descendant tables are included. This does not apply to a partitioned table,
           however. The partitions of a partitioned table are always implicitly considered part of the
           publication, so they are never explicitly added to the publication.

           If the optional WHERE clause is specified, it defines a row filter expression. Rows for which the
           <u>expression</u> evaluates to false or null will not be published. Note that parentheses are required
           around the expression. It has no effect on TRUNCATE commands.

           When a column list is specified, only the named columns are replicated. If no column list is
           specified, all columns of the table are replicated through this publication, including any columns
           added later. It has no effect on TRUNCATE commands. See Section 29.5 for details about column lists.

           Only persistent base tables and partitioned tables can be part of a publication. Temporary tables,
           unlogged tables, foreign tables, materialized views, and regular views cannot be part of a
           publication.

           Specifying a column list when the publication also publishes FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA is not supported.

           When a partitioned table is added to a publication, all of its existing and future partitions are
           implicitly considered to be part of the publication. So, even operations that are performed directly
           on a partition are also published via publications that its ancestors are part of.

       FOR ALL TABLES
           Marks the publication as one that replicates changes for all tables in the database, including tables
           created in the future.

       FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA
           Marks the publication as one that replicates changes for all tables in the specified list of schemas,
           including tables created in the future.

           Specifying a schema when the publication also publishes a table with a column list is not supported.

           Only persistent base tables and partitioned tables present in the schema will be included as part of
           the publication. Temporary tables, unlogged tables, foreign tables, materialized views, and regular
           views from the schema will not be part of the publication.

           When a partitioned table is published via schema level publication, all of its existing and future
           partitions are implicitly considered to be part of the publication, regardless of whether they are
           from the publication schema or not. So, even operations that are performed directly on a partition
           are also published via publications that its ancestors are part of.

       WITH ( <u>publication_parameter</u> [= <u>value</u>] [, ... ] )
           This clause specifies optional parameters for a publication. The following parameters are supported:

           publish (string)
               This parameter determines which DML operations will be published by the new publication to the
               subscribers. The value is comma-separated list of operations. The allowed operations are insert,
               update, delete, and truncate. The default is to publish all actions, and so the default value for
               this option is 'insert, update, delete, truncate'.

               This parameter only affects DML operations. In particular, the initial data synchronization (see
               Section 29.8.1) for logical replication does not take this parameter into account when copying
               existing table data.

           publish_via_partition_root (boolean)
               This parameter determines whether changes in a partitioned table (or on its partitions) contained
               in the publication will be published using the identity and schema of the partitioned table
               rather than that of the individual partitions that are actually changed; the latter is the
               default. Enabling this allows the changes to be replicated into a non-partitioned table or a
               partitioned table consisting of a different set of partitions.

               There can be a case where a subscription combines multiple publications. If a partitioned table
               is published by any subscribed publications which set publish_via_partition_root = true, changes
               on this partitioned table (or on its partitions) will be published using the identity and schema
               of this partitioned table rather than that of the individual partitions.

               This parameter also affects how row filters and column lists are chosen for partitions; see below
               for details.

               If this is enabled, TRUNCATE operations performed directly on partitions are not replicated.

       When specifying a parameter of type boolean, the = <u>value</u> part can be omitted, which is equivalent to
       specifying TRUE.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       If FOR TABLE, FOR ALL TABLES or FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA are not specified, then the publication starts out
       with an empty set of tables. That is useful if tables or schemas are to be added later.

       The creation of a publication does not start replication. It only defines a grouping and filtering logic
       for future subscribers.

       To create a publication, the invoking user must have the CREATE privilege for the current database. (Of
       course, superusers bypass this check.)

       To add a table to a publication, the invoking user must have ownership rights on the table. The <b>FOR</b> <b>ALL</b>
       <b>TABLES</b> and <b>FOR</b> <b>TABLES</b> <b>IN</b> <b>SCHEMA</b> clauses require the invoking user to be a superuser.

       The tables added to a publication that publishes <b>UPDATE</b> and/or <b>DELETE</b> operations must have REPLICA
       IDENTITY defined. Otherwise those operations will be disallowed on those tables.

       Any column list must include the REPLICA IDENTITY columns in order for <b>UPDATE</b> or <b>DELETE</b> operations to be
       published. There are no column list restrictions if the publication publishes only <b>INSERT</b> operations.

       A row filter expression (i.e., the WHERE clause) must contain only columns that are covered by the
       REPLICA IDENTITY, in order for <b>UPDATE</b> and <b>DELETE</b> operations to be published. For publication of <b>INSERT</b>
       operations, any column may be used in the WHERE expression. The row filter allows simple expressions that
       don't have user-defined functions, user-defined operators, user-defined types, user-defined collations,
       non-immutable built-in functions, or references to system columns.

       The row filter on a table becomes redundant if FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA is specified and the table belongs to
       the referred schema.

       For published partitioned tables, the row filter for each partition is taken from the published
       partitioned table if the publication parameter publish_via_partition_root is true, or from the partition
       itself if it is false (the default). See Section 29.4 for details about row filters. Similarly, for
       published partitioned tables, the column list for each partition is taken from the published partitioned
       table if the publication parameter publish_via_partition_root is true, or from the partition itself if it
       is false.

       For an <b>INSERT</b> <b>...</b> <b>ON</b> <b>CONFLICT</b> command, the publication will publish the operation that results from the
       command. Depending on the outcome, it may be published as either <b>INSERT</b> or <b>UPDATE</b>, or it may not be
       published at all.

       For a <b>MERGE</b> command, the publication will publish an <b>INSERT</b>, <b>UPDATE</b>, or <b>DELETE</b> for each row inserted,
       updated, or deleted.

       <b>ATTACH</b>ing a table into a partition tree whose root is published using a publication with
       publish_via_partition_root set to true does not result in the table's existing contents being replicated.

       <b>COPY</b> <b>...</b> <b>FROM</b> commands are published as <b>INSERT</b> operations.

       DDL operations are not published.

       The WHERE clause expression is executed with the role used for the replication connection.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Create a publication that publishes all changes in two tables:

           CREATE PUBLICATION mypublication FOR TABLE users, departments;

       Create a publication that publishes all changes from active departments:

           CREATE PUBLICATION active_departments FOR TABLE departments WHERE (active IS TRUE);

       Create a publication that publishes all changes in all tables:

           CREATE PUBLICATION alltables FOR ALL TABLES;

       Create a publication that only publishes <b>INSERT</b> operations in one table:

           CREATE PUBLICATION insert_only FOR TABLE mydata
               WITH (publish = 'insert');

       Create a publication that publishes all changes for tables users, departments and all changes for all the
       tables present in the schema production:

           CREATE PUBLICATION production_publication FOR TABLE users, departments, TABLES IN SCHEMA production;

       Create a publication that publishes all changes for all the tables present in the schemas marketing and
       sales:

           CREATE PUBLICATION sales_publication FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA marketing, sales;

       Create a publication that publishes all changes for table users, but replicates only columns user_id and
       firstname:

           CREATE PUBLICATION users_filtered FOR TABLE users (user_id, firstname);
