       This document describes the virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) subsystem for Xen. The reader is
       assumed to have familiarity with building and installing Xen, Linux, and a basic understanding of the TPM
       and vTPM concepts.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       The goal of this work is to provide a TPM functionality to a virtual guest operating system (a DomU).
       This allows programs to interact with a TPM in a virtual system the same way they interact with a TPM on
       the physical system.  Each guest gets its own unique, emulated, software TPM.  However, each of the
       vTPM's secrets (Keys, NVRAM, etc) are managed by a vTPM Manager domain, which seals the secrets to the
       Physical TPM.  If the process of creating each of these domains (manager, vTPM, and guest) is trusted,
       the vTPM subsystem extends the chain of trust rooted in the hardware TPM to virtual machines in Xen. Each
       major component of vTPM is implemented as a separate domain, providing secure separation guaranteed by
       the hypervisor. The vTPM domains are implemented in mini-os to reduce memory and processor overhead.

       This mini-os vTPM subsystem was built on top of the previous vTPM work done by IBM and Intel corporation.

</pre><h4><b>DESIGN</b> <b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       The architecture of vTPM is described below:

       Linux DomU
           The Linux based guest that wants to use a vTPM. There many be more than one of these.

       xen-tpmfront.ko
           Linux  kernel  virtual  TPM  frontend  driver. This driver provides vTPM access to a para-virtualized
           Linux based DomU.

       mini-os/tpmback
           Mini-os TPM backend driver. The Linux frontend driver connects to this backend driver  to  facilitate
           communications  between  the  Linux DomU and its vTPM. This driver is also used by vtpmmgr-stubdom to
           communicate with vtpm-stubdom.

       vtpm-stubdom
           A mini-os stub domain that implements a vTPM. There is a one to one  mapping  between  running  vtpm-
           stubdom  instances  and logical vtpms on the system. The vTPM Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs)
           are all initialized to zero.

       mini-os/tpmfront
           Mini-os TPM frontend driver. The vTPM mini-os domain vtpm-stubdom uses  this  driver  to  communicate
           with  vtpmmgr-stubdom.  This  driver could also be used separately to implement a mini-os domain that
           wishes to use a vTPM of its own.

       vtpmmgr-stubdom
           A mini-os domain that implements the vTPM manager.  There is only one vTPM manager and it  should  be
           running  during the entire lifetime of the machine.  This domain regulates access to the physical TPM
           on the system and secures the persistent state of each vTPM.

       mini-os/tpm_tis
           Mini-os TPM version 1.2 TPM Interface Specification (TIS) driver. This driver used by vtpmmgr-stubdom
           to talk directly to the hardware TPM. Communication is facilitated by mapping hardware  memory  pages
           into vtpmmgr-stubdom.

       Hardware TPM
           The physical TPM that is soldered onto the motherboard.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Prerequisites:</b>
       You  must  have  an  x86  machine with a TPM on the motherboard.  The only extra software requirement for
       compiling vTPM is cmake.  You must use libxl to manage domains with vTPMs; 'xm' is  deprecated  and  does
       not support vTPMs.

   <b>Compiling</b> <b>the</b> <b>Xen</b> <b>tree:</b>
       Compile  and  install  the  Xen  tree  as  usual;  be sure that the vTPM domains are enabled when you run
       configure.

   <b>Compiling</b> <b>the</b> <b>LINUX</b> <b>dom0</b> <b>kernel:</b>
       Because the TPM manager uses direct access to the physical TPM, it may interfere with access to  the  TPM
       by  dom0.  The simplest solution for this is to prevent dom0 from accessing the physical TPM by compiling
       the kernel without a driver or blacklisting the module.  If dom0 needs a TPM but does not need to use  it
       during  the  boot  process  (i.e.  it  is not using IMA), a virtual TPM can be attached to dom0 after the
       system is booted.

       Access to the physical TPM may be required in order to manage the NVRAM  or  to  perform  other  advanced
       operations  where  the  vTPM is insufficient.  In order to prevent interference, the TPM Manager and dom0
       should use different values for the TPM's locality; since Linux always uses locality 0, using locality  2
       for  the  TPM Manager is recommended.  If both Linux and the TPM Manager attempt to access the TPM at the
       same time, the TPM device will return a busy status; some applications will consider this a  fatal  error
       instead  of  retrying the command at a later time.  If a vTPM gets an error when loading its key, it will
       currently generate a fresh vTPM image (with a new EK, SRK, and blank NVRAM).

   <b>Compiling</b> <b>the</b> <b>LINUX</b> <b>domU</b> <b>kernel:</b>
       The domU kernel used by domains with vtpms must include the  xen-tpmfront.ko  driver.  It  can  be  built
       directly  into  the kernel or as a module; however, some features such as IMA require the TPM to be built
       in to the kernel.

           CONFIG_TCG_TPM=y
           CONFIG_TCG_XEN=y

</pre><h4><b>VTPM</b> <b>MANAGER</b> <b>SETUP</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Manager</b> <b>disk</b> <b>image</b> <b>setup:</b>
       The vTPM Manager requires a disk image to store  its  encrypted  data.  The  image  does  not  require  a
       filesystem and can live anywhere on the host disk. The image is not large; the Xen 4.5 vtpmmgr is limited
       to using the first 2MB of the image but can support more than 20,000 vTPMs.

   <b>Manager</b> <b>config</b> <b>file:</b>
       The vTPM Manager domain (vtpmmgr-stubdom) must be started like any other Xen virtual machine and requires
       a  config  file.   The  manager  requires  a disk image for storage and permission to access the hardware
       memory pages for the TPM. The disk must be presented as "hda", and the TPM memory pages are passed  using
       the iomem configuration parameter. The TPM TIS uses 5 pages of IO memory (one per locality) that start at
       physical  address 0xfed40000. By default, the TPM manager uses locality 0 (so only the page at 0xfed40 is
       needed); this can be changed on the domain's command line.  For full functionality in deep quotes,  using
       locality 2 is required to manipulate PCR 20-22.

   <b>Starting</b> <b>and</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>the</b> <b>manager:</b>
       The  vTPM  manager  should  be  started  at boot; you may wish to create an init script to do this.  If a
       domain builder is used, the TPM Manager should be started by the domain builder to minimize  the  trusted
       computing base for the vTPM manager's secrets.

       Once initialization is complete you should see the following:

           INFO[VTPM]: Waiting for commands from vTPM's:

       The TPM Manager does not respond to shutdown requests; use the destroy command to shut it down.

</pre><h4><b>VTPM</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LINUX</b> <b>PVM</b> <b>SETUP</b></h4><pre>
   <b>vTPM</b> <b>disk</b> <b>image</b> <b>setup:</b>
       The  vTPM  requires  a disk image to store its persistent data (RSA keys, NVRAM, etc). The image does not
       require a filesystem. The image does not need to be large; 2 Mb should be sufficient.

   <b>vTPM</b> <b>config</b> <b>file:</b>
       The vTPM domain requires a configuration file like any other domain. The vTPM requires a disk  image  for
       storage  and  a TPM frontend driver to communicate with the manager.  You are required to generate a uuid
       for this vtpm, which is specified on the "vtpm=" line that describes its connection to the vTPM  Manager.
       The  uuidgen application may be used to generate a uuid, or one from the output of the "manage-vtpmmgr.pl
       vtpm-add" command may be used to create a vTPM belonging to a specific group.

       If you wish to clear the vTPM data you can either recreate the disk image or change the uuid.

   <b>Linux</b> <b>Guest</b> <b>config</b> <b>file:</b>
       The Linux guest config file needs to be modified to include the Linux tpmfront driver. Add the  following
       line:

           vtpm=["backend=domu-vtpm"]

       Currently only Linux guests are supported (PV or HVM with PV drivers).

       While  attaching  a  vTPM  after a guest is booted (using xl vtpm-attach) is supported, the attached vTPM
       will not have a record of the boot of the attached guest.  Furthermore, if  the  vTPM  has  been  freshly
       created,  a  malicious  guest  could  then  extend  any  values  into  PCRs, potentially forging its boot
       configuration.  Attaching a vTPM to a running domain should only be used  for  trusted  domains  or  when
       measurements have already been sent to the vTPM from another source.

   <b>Using</b> <b>the</b> <b>vTPM</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest:</b>
       If xen-tpmfront was compiled as a module, it must be loaded it in the guest.

           # modprobe xen-tpmfront

       After  the  Linux domain boots and the xen-tpmfront driver is loaded, you should see the following on the
       vtpm console:

           Info: VTPM attached to Frontend X/Y

       You can quickly test the vTPM by using the sysfs interface:

           # cat /sys/devices/vtpm-0/pubek
           # cat /sys/devices/vtpm-0/pcrs

       If you have trousers and tpm_tools installed on the guest, the  tpm_version  command  should  return  the
       following:

       The version command should return the following:

           TPM 1.2 Version Info:
           Chip Version:        1.2.0.7
           Spec Level:          2
           Errata Revision:     1
           TPM Vendor ID:       ETHZ
           TPM Version:         01010000
           Manufacturer Info:   4554485a

       You  should also see the command being sent to the vtpm console as well as the vtpm saving its state. You
       should see the vtpm key being encrypted and stored on the vtpmmgr console.

       You may wish to write a script to start your vtpm and guest together and to destroy  the  vtpm  when  the
       guest shuts down.

</pre><h4><b>INTEGRATION</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>PV-GRUB</b></h4><pre>
       The  vTPM  currently  starts  up  with all PCRs set to their default values (all zeros for the lower 16).
       This means that any decisions about the trustworthiness of the created domain must be made based  on  the
       environment that created the vTPM and the domU; for example, a system that only constructs images using a
       trusted  configuration  and  guest  kernel  be  able  to  provide  guarantees  about  the  guests and any
       measurements done that kernel (such as the IMA TCB log).  Guests wishing to use a custom kernel in such a
       secure environment are often started using the pv-grub bootloader as the kernel, which then can load  the
       untrusted  kernel  without  needing  to parse an untrusted filesystem and kernel in dom0.  If the pv-grub
       stub domain succeeds in connecting to a vTPM, it will extend the hash of the kernel that  it  boots  into
       PCR  #4,  and will extend the command line and initrd into PCR #5 before booting so that a domU booted in
       this way can attest to its early boot state.

</pre><h4><b>MORE</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       See &lt;<b><a href="../man7/xen-vtpmmgr.7.html">xen-vtpmmgr</a></b>(7)&gt; for more details about how the manager domain works, how to use it, and its  command
       line parameters.

</pre><h4><b>VTPM</b> <b>DOMAIN</b> <b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  vtpm-stubdom  is a mini-OS domain that emulates a TPM for the guest OS to use. It is a small wrapper
       around the Berlios TPM emulator version 0.7.4.  Commands are passed from the linux guest via the  mini-os
       TPM  backend driver.  vTPM data is encrypted and stored via a disk image provided to the virtual machine.
       The key used to encrypt the data along with a hash of the vTPM's data is sent to  the  vTPM  manager  for
       secure  storage  and  later retrieval.  The vTPM domain communicates with the manager using a mini-os tpm
       front/back device pair.

</pre><h4><b>VTPM</b> <b>DOMAIN</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Command line arguments are passed to the domain via the 'extra' parameter in the  VM  config  file.  Each
       parameter is separated by white space. For example:

           extra="foo=bar baz"

   <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arguments:</b>
       <b>loglevel</b>=&lt;LOG&gt;
           Controls the amount of logging printed to the console.  The possible values for &lt;LOG&gt; are:

           •   error

           •   info (default)

           •   debug

       <b>clear</b>
           Start the Berlios emulator in "clear" mode. (default)

       <b>save</b>
           Start the Berlios emulator in "save" mode.

       <b>deactivated</b>
           Start  the  Berlios  emulator  in "deactivated" mode.  See the Berlios TPM emulator documentation for
           details about the startup mode. For all normal use, always use clear which is the default. You should
           not need to specify any of these.

       <b>maintcmds</b>=&lt;1|0&gt;
           Enable to disable the TPM maintenance commands.  These commands are used  by  tpm  manufacturers  and
           thus open a security hole. They are disabled by default.

       <b>hwinitpcr</b>=&lt;PCRSPEC&gt;
           Initialize the virtual Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) with PCR values from the hardware TPM.
           Each  pcr  specified  by &lt;PCRSPEC&gt; will be initialized with the value of that same PCR in TPM once at
           startup. By default all PCRs are zero initialized.  Possible values of &lt;PCRSPEC&gt; are:

           •   all: copy all pcrs

           •   none: copy no pcrs (default)

           •   &lt;N&gt;: copy pcr n

           •   &lt;X-Y&gt;: copy pcrs x to y (inclusive)

           These can also be combined by comma separation, for example: "hwinitpcrs=5,12-16" will copy  pcrs  5,
           12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.
