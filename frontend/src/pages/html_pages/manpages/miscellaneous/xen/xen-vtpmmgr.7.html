       This  document describes the operation and command line interface of vtpmmgr-stubdom. See <b><a href="../man7/xen-vtpm.7.html">xen-vtpm</a></b>(7) for
       details on the vTPM subsystem as a whole.

</pre><h4><b>Overview</b></h4><pre>
       The TPM Manager has three primary functions:

       1. Securely store the encryption keys for vTPMs
       2. Provide a single controlled path of access to the physical TPM
       3. Provide evidence (via TPM Quotes) of the current configuration

       When combined with a platform that provides a trusted  method  for  creating  domains,  the  TPM  Manager
       provides assurance that the private keys in a vTPM are only available in specific trusted configurations.

       The  manager  accepts commands from the vtpm-stubdom domains via the mini-os TPM backend driver. The vTPM
       manager communicates directly with hardware TPM using the mini-os tpm_tis driver.

</pre><h4><b>Boot</b> <b>Configurations</b> <b>and</b> <b>TPM</b> <b>Groups</b></h4><pre>
       The TPM Manager's data is secured by using the physical TPM's seal operation, which  allows  data  to  be
       bound  to  specific PCRs. These PCRs are populated in the physical TPM during the boot process, either by
       the firmware/BIOS or by a dynamic launch environment such as TBOOT. In order to provide assurance of  the
       system's  security,  the  PCRs  used to seal the TPM manager's data must contain measurements for domains
       used to bootstrap the TPM Manager and vTPMs.

       Because these measurements are based on hashes, they will change any  time  that  any  component  of  the
       system  is  upgraded.  Since  it  is  not  possible  to  construct  a  list  of  all possible future good
       measurements, the job of approving configurations is delegated to a third party, referred to here as  the
       system  approval  agent  (SAA). The SAA is identified by its public (RSA) signature key, which is used to
       sign lists of valid configurations. A single TPM manager can support multiple SAAs via the  use  of  vTPM
       groups.  Each  group  is  associated  with  a  single  SAA;  this  allows  the creation of a multi-tenant
       environment where tenants may not all choose to trust the same SAA.

       Each vTPM is bound to a vTPM group at the time of its creation. Each vTPM group has its own  AIK  in  the
       physical  TPM  for  quotes of the hardware TPM state; when used with a conforming Privacy CA, this allows
       each group on the system to form the basis of a distinct identity.

</pre><h4><b>Initial</b> <b>Provisioning</b></h4><pre>
       When the TPM Manager first boots up, it will create a stub vTPM group along with entries  for  any  vTPMs
       that  communicate  with  it.  This stub group must be provisioned with an SAA and a boot configuration in
       order to survive a reboot.

       When a vTPM is connected to the TPM Manager using a UUID that is not recognized, a slot will  be  created
       in  group  0  for  it. In the future, this auto-creation may be restricted to specific UUIDs (such as the
       all-zero UUID) to enforce the use of the TPM manager as the generator of the UUID. The first vTPM  to  be
       connected  is  given  administrative  privileges for the TPM Manager, and should be attached to dom0 or a
       control domain in order to send provisioning commands.

       Provisioning a vTPM group for the system requires the public key of the SAA and privacy CA data  used  to
       certify  the  AIK  (see  the  TPM  spec  for  details).  Once the group is created, a signed list of boot
       measurements can be installed. The initial group controls the ability to boot the system as a whole,  and
       cannot be deleted once provisioned.

</pre><h4><b>Command</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Arguments</b></h4><pre>
       Command  line  arguments  are  passed to the domain via the 'extra' parameter in the VM config file. Each
       parameter is separated by white space. For example:

           extra="foo=bar baz"

       Valid arguments:

       srk_handle=&lt;HANDLE&gt;
           Specify a srk_handle for TPM 2.0.  TPM 2.0 uses a key hierarchy, and this allow specifying the parent
           handle for vtpmmgr to create its own key under.  Using this option bypasses vtpmmgr  trying  to  take
           ownership of the TPM.

       owner_auth=&lt;AUTHSPEC&gt;
       srk_auth=&lt;AUTHSPEC&gt;
           Set the owner and SRK authdata for the TPM. If not specified, the default is 160 zero bits (the well-
           known auth value). Valid values of &lt;AUTHSPEC&gt; are:

           well-known
               Use the well known auth (default)

           hash:&lt;HASH&gt;
               Use the given 40-character ASCII hex string

           text:&lt;STR&gt;
               Use sha1 hash of &lt;STR&gt;.

       tpmdriver=&lt;DRIVER&gt;
           Choose the driver used for communication with the hardware TPM. Values other than tpm_tis should only
           be used for testing.

           The possible values of &lt;DRIVER&gt; are:

           tpm_tis
               Direct  communication  with  a  hardware  TPM 1.2.  The domain must have access to TPM IO memory.
               (default)

           tpmfront
               Use the Xen tpmfront interface to talk to another domain which provides access to the TPM.

       The following options only apply to the tpm_tis driver:

       tpmiomem=&lt;ADDR&gt;
           The base address of the hardware memory pages of the TPM.  The default is 0xfed40000, as  defined  by
           the TCG's PC Client spec.

       tpmirq=&lt;IRQ&gt;
           The  irq of the hardware TPM if using interrupts. A value of "probe" can be set to probe for the irq.
           A value of 0 disables interrupts and uses polling (default 0).

       tpmlocality=&lt;LOC&gt;
           Attempt to use locality &lt;LOC&gt; of the hardware TPM.  For full functionality of the TPM  Manager,  this
           should be set to "2".

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Assumptions</b></h4><pre>
       While  the TPM Manager has the ability to check the hash of the vTPM requesting a key, there is currently
       no trusted method to inform the TPM Manager of the hash of each new domain.  Because  of  this,  the  TPM
       Manager  trusts  the  UUID key in Xenstore to identify a vTPM in a trusted manner.  The XSM policy may be
       used to strengthen this assumption if the creation of  vTPM-labeled  domains  is  more  constrained  (for
       example,  only  permitted  to a domain builder service): the only grants mapped by the TPM Manager should
       belong to vTPM domains, so restricting the ability to map other domain's granted pages will prevent other
       domains from directly requesting keys from the TPM Manager.  The TPM Manager uses the  hash  of  the  XSM
       label  of  the attached vTPM as the kernel hash, so vTPMs with distinct labels may be further partitioned
       using vTPM groups.

       A domain with direct access to the hardware TPM will be able to decrypt the TPM Manager's disk  image  if
       the  haredware TPM's PCR values are in a permitted configuration.  To protect the TPM Manager's data, the
       list of permitted configurations should be chosen to include PCRs that measure the hypervisor, domain  0,
       the  TPM  Manager,  and  other  critical  configuration  such  as  the XSM policy.  If the TPM Manager is
       configured to use locality 2 as recommended, it is safe to permit the hardware domain to access  locality
       0  (the  default  in  Linux),  although  concurrent  use of the TPM should be avoided as it can result in
       unexpected busy errors from the TPM driver.  The ability to access  locality  2  of  the  TPM  should  be
       enforced using IO memory labeling in the XSM policy; the physical address 0xFED42xxx is always locality 2
       for TPMs using the TIS driver.

</pre><h4><b>Appendix:</b> <b>unsecured</b> <b>migration</b> <b>process</b> <b>for</b> <b>vtpmmgr</b> <b>domain</b> <b>upgrade</b></h4><pre>
       There  is  no direct upgrade supported from previous versions of the vtpmmgr domain due to changes in the
       on-disk format and the method used to seal data.  If a  vTPM  domain  supports  migration,  this  feature
       should  be  used  to  migrate  the  vTPM's data; however, the vTPM packaged with Xen does not yet support
       migration.

       If adding migration support to the vTPM is not desired, a simpler migration domain usable only for  local
       migration can be constructed. The migration process would look like the following:

       1. Start the old vtpmmgr
       2. Start the vTPM migration domain
       3. Attach the vTPM migration domain's vtpm/0 device to the old vtpmmgr
       4. Migration domain executes vtpmmgr_LoadHashKey on vtpm/0
       5. Start the new vtpmmgr, possibly shutting down the old one first
       6. Attach the vTPM migration domain's vtpm/1 device to the new vtpmmgr
       7. Migration domain executes vtpmmgr_SaveHashKey on vtpm/1

       This  requires  the  migration domain to be added to the list of valid vTPM kernel hashes. In the current
       version of the vtpmmgr domain, this is the hash of the XSM label, not the kernel.

</pre><h4><b>Appendix</b> <b>B:</b> <b>vtpmmgr</b> <b>on</b> <b>TPM</b> <b>2.0</b></h4><pre>
   <b>WARNING:</b> <b>Incomplete</b> <b>-</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>persist</b> <b>data</b>
       TPM 2.0 support for vTPM manager is incomplete.  There is no support for persisting an encryption key, so
       vTPM manager regenerates primary and secondary key handles each boot.

       Also, the vTPM manger group command implementation  hardcodes  TPM  1.2  commands.   This  means  running
       manage-vtpmmgr.pl  fails  when  the TPM 2.0 hardware rejects the TPM 1.2 commands.  vTPM manager with TPM
       2.0 cannot create groups and therefore cannot persist vTPM contents.

   <b>Manager</b> <b>disk</b> <b>image</b> <b>setup:</b>
       The vTPM Manager requires a disk image to store  its  encrypted  data.  The  image  does  not  require  a
       filesystem and can live anywhere on the host disk. The image is not large; the Xen 4.5 vtpmmgr is limited
       to using the first 2MB of the image but can support more than 20,000 vTPMs.

           dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/vtpm2/vmgr bs=16M count=1

   <b>Manager</b> <b>config</b> <b>file:</b>
       The vTPM Manager domain (vtpmmgr-stubdom) must be started like any other Xen virtual machine and requires
       a  config  file.   The  manager  requires  a disk image for storage and permission to access the hardware
       memory pages for the TPM. The disk must be presented as "hda", and the TPM memory pages are passed  using
       the iomem configuration parameter. The TPM TIS uses 5 pages of IO memory (one per locality) that start at
       physical  address 0xfed40000. By default, the TPM manager uses locality 0 (so only the page at 0xfed40 is
       needed).

       Add:

            extra="tpm2=1"

       extra option to launch vtpmmgr-stubdom domain on TPM 2.0, and ignore it on TPM 1.x. for example:

           kernel="/usr/lib/xen/boot/vtpmmgr-stubdom.gz"
           memory=128
           disk=["file:/home/vtpm2/vmgr,hda,w"]
           name="vtpmmgr"
           iomem=["fed40,5"]
           extra="tpm2=1"

           +------------------+

           | TPM 2.0 Storage  |
           |   Primary Seed   |
           +------------------+

       Now the secrets for the vTPMs are only being bound to the presence of the physical TPM 2.0.  Since  using
       PCRs  to  seal  the  data  can be an important security feature that users of the vtpmmgr rely on. I will
       replace TPM2_Bind/TPM2_Unbind with TPM2_Seal/TPM2_Unseal to provide as much security as it  did  for  TPM
       1.2 in later series of patch.

       Linux DomU
           The Linux based guest that wants to use a vTPM. There many be more than one of these.

       xen-tpmfront.ko
           Linux  kernel  virtual  TPM  frontend  driver. This driver provides vTPM access to a para-virtualized
           Linux based DomU.

       mini-os/tpmback
           Mini-os TPM backend driver. The Linux frontend driver connects to this backend driver  to  facilitate
           communications  between  the  Linux DomU and its vTPM. This driver is also used by vtpmmgr-stubdom to
           communicate with vtpm-stubdom.

       vtpm-stubdom
           A mini-os stub domain that implements a vTPM. There is a one to one  mapping  between  running  vtpm-
           stubdom  instances  and logical vtpms on the system. The vTPM Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs)
           are all initialized to zero.

       mini-os/tpmfront
           Mini-os TPM frontend driver. The vTPM mini-os domain vtpm-stubdom uses  this  driver  to  communicate
           with  vtpmmgr-stubdom.  This  driver could also be used separately to implement a mini-os domain that
           wishes to use a vTPM of its own.

       vtpmmgr-stubdom
           A mini-os domain that implements the vTPM manager.  There is only one vTPM manager and it  should  be
           running  during the entire lifetime of the machine.  This domain regulates access to the physical TPM
           on the system and secures the persistent state of each vTPM.

       mini-os/tpm2_tis
           Mini-os TPM version 2.0 TPM Interface Specification (TIS) driver. This driver used by vtpmmgr-stubdom
           to talk directly to the hardware TPM 2.0. Communication is facilitated  by  mapping  hardware  memory
           pages into vtpmmgr-stubdom.

       Hardware TPM 2.0
           The physical TPM 2.0 that is soldered onto the motherboard.

       Noted:
           functionality for a virtual guest operating system (a DomU) is still TPM 1.2.
