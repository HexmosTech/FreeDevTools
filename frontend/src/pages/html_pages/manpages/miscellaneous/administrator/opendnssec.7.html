       <b>OpenDNSSEC</b> - making DNSSEC easy for DNS administrators

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ods-control</b> <b>start</b> <b>|</b> <b>stop</b>

       <b>ods-enforcer</b> <u>subcommand...</u>

       <b>ods-signer</b> [<u>subcommand...</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       OpenDNSSEC  is  a  complete  DNSSEC  zone signing system which maintains stability and security of signed
       domains. DNSSEC adds many cryptographic concerns to DNS; OpenDNSSEC automates those to allow current  DNS
       administrators to adopt DNSSEC.

       Domain  signing is done by placing OpenDNSSEC between the place where the zone files are edited and where
       they are published.  The current version of OpenDNSSEC supports files and AXFR to  communicate  the  zone
       data; effectively, OpenDNSSEC acts as a "bump in the wire" between editing and publishing a zone.

       OpenDNSSEC  has  two  daemons, which are unitedly started and stopped through the <u><a href="../man8/ods-control.8.html">ods-control</a>(8)</u> command.
       The two daemons in turn invoke other programs to get their work done.

       One of the daemons is the KASP  Enforcer,  which  enforces  policies  that  define  security  and  timing
       requirements  for each individual zone.  Operators tend to interact with the KASP Enforcer a lot, through
       the <u><a href="../man8/ods-enforcer.8.html">ods-enforcer</a>(8)</u> command.

       The other daemon is the Signer Engine, which in turn signs the zone content.  It retrieves  that  content
       from  a  file  or  through  AXFR, and publishes a signed version of the zone into a file or through AXFR.
       Direct interaction with the Signer Engine, although not  normally  necessary,  is  possible  through  the
       <u><a href="../man8/ods-signer.8.html">ods-signer</a>(8)</u> command.

       The  keys that sign the zones are managed by an independent repository, which is accessed over a PKCS #11
       interface.  The principle idea of this interface being to unleash access to cryptographic hardware, there
       are implementations in software.  Also, implementations range from open  to  commercial,  and  from  very
       simple  to  highly  secure.   By  default, OpenDNSSEC is configured to run on top of a SoftHSM, but a few
       other commands exist to test any Hardware Security Module that may sit under the PKCS #11 API.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATIONAL</b> <b>PRACTICES</b></h4><pre>
       The approach used by OpenDNSSEC follows the best current practice of two kinds of key per zone:

       <b>KSK</b> or <b>Key</b> <b>Signing</b> <b>Key</b>
              This key belongs in the apex of a zone, and is referenced in the parent  zone  (quite  possibly  a
              registry)  in  the  form  of DS records alongside NS records.  These parent references function as
              trust delegations.

              The KSK is usually a longer key, and it could harm the  efficiency  of  secure  resolvers  if  all
              individual  resource records were signed with it.  This is why it is advisable to use the KSK only
              to sign the ZSK.

              In DNS records, the KSK can usually be recognised by having its SEP (Secure Entry Point) flag set.

       <b>ZSK</b> or <b>Zone</b> <b>Signing</b> <b>Key</b>
              This key also belongs in the apex of a zone, and is actually used to sign the resource records  in
              a  zone.   It  is a shorter key for reasons of efficiency, that is rolled over on a fairly regular
              basis.  To detach these rollovers from the parent, the ZSK is not directly trusted by  the  parent
              zone, but instead its trust is established by way of a signature by the KSK on the ZSK.

       OpenDNSSEC  is  mindful  about  the period of validity of each key, and will rollover in time to keep the
       domain signed, with new keys, without any downtime for the secure domain.  The only  thing  that  is  not
       standardised,  and thus cannot be automated at the moment is the interface between a zone and its parent,
       so this has to be done manually, or scripted around OpenDNSSEC.
