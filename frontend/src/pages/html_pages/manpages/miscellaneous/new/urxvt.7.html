</pre><h4><b>RXVT-UNICODE/URXVT</b> <b>FREQUENTLY</b> <b>ASKED</b> <b>QUESTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Meta,</b> <b>Features</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Commandline</b> <b>Issues</b>
       <u>My</u> <u>question</u> <u>isn't</u> <u>answered</u> <u>here,</u> <u>can</u> <u>I</u> <u>ask</u> <u>a</u> <u>human?</u>

       Before sending me mail, you could go to IRC: "irc.libera.chat", channel "#rxvt-unicode" has some rxvt-
       unicode enthusiasts that might be interested in learning about new and exciting problems (but not FAQs
       :).

       <u>I</u> <u>use</u> <u>Gentoo,</u> <u>and</u> <u>I</u> <u>have</u> <u>a</u> <u>problem...</u>

       There are two big problems with Gentoo Linux: first, most if not all Gentoo systems are completely broken
       (missing or mismatched header files, broken compiler etc. are just the tip of the iceberg); secondly, it
       should be called Gentoo GNU/Linux.

       For these reasons, it is impossible to support rxvt-unicode on Gentoo. Problems appearing on Gentoo
       systems will usually simply be ignored unless they can be reproduced on non-Gentoo systems.

       <u>Does</u> <u>it</u> <u>support</u> <u>tabs,</u> <u>can</u> <u>I</u> <u>have</u> <u>a</u> <u>tabbed</u> <u>rxvt-unicode?</u>

       Beginning with version 7.3, there is a perl extension that implements a simple tabbed terminal. It is
       installed by default, so any of these should give you tabs:

          urxvt -pe tabbed

          URxvt.perl-ext-common: default,tabbed

       It will also work fine with tabbing functionality of many window managers or similar tabbing programs,
       and its embedding-features allow it to be embedded into other programs, as witnessed by <u>doc/rxvt-tabbed</u>
       or the upcoming "Gtk2::URxvt" perl module, which features a tabbed urxvt (murxvt) terminal as an example
       embedding application.

       <u>How</u> <u>do</u> <u>I</u> <u>know</u> <u>which</u> <u>rxvt-unicode</u> <u>version</u> <u>I'm</u> <u>using?</u>

       The version number is displayed with the usage (-h). Also the escape sequence "ESC [ 8 n" sets the window
       title to the version number. When using the urxvtc client, the version displayed is that of the daemon.

       <u>Rxvt-unicode</u> <u>uses</u> <u>gobs</u> <u>of</u> <u>memory,</u> <u>how</u> <u>can</u> <u>I</u> <u>reduce</u> <u>that?</u>

       Rxvt-unicode tries to obey the rule of not charging you for something you don't use. One thing you should
       try is to configure out all settings that you don't need, for example, Xft support is a resource hog by
       design, when used. Compiling it out ensures that no Xft font will be loaded accidentally when rxvt-
       unicode tries to find a font for your characters.

       Also, many people (me included) like large windows and even larger scrollback buffers: Without
       "--enable-unicode3", rxvt-unicode will use 6 bytes per screen cell. For a 160x?? window this amounts to
       almost a kilobyte per line. A scrollback buffer of 10000 lines will then (if full) use 10 Megabytes of
       memory. With "--enable-unicode3" it gets worse, as rxvt-unicode then uses 8 bytes per screen cell.

       <u>How</u> <u>can</u> <u>I</u> <u>start</u> <u>urxvtd</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>race-free</u> <u>way?</u>

       Try "urxvtd -f -o", which tells urxvtd to open the display, create the listening socket and then fork.

       <u>How</u> <u>can</u> <u>I</u> <u>start</u> <u>urxvtd</u> <u>automatically</u> <u>when</u> <u>I</u> <u>run</u> <u>urxvtc?</u>

       If you want to start urxvtd automatically whenever you run urxvtc and the daemon isn't running yet, use
       this script:

          #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
          urxvtc "$@"
          if [ $? -eq 2 ]; then
             urxvtd -q -o -f
             urxvtc "$@"
          fi

       This tries to create a new terminal, and if fails with exit status 2, meaning it couldn't connect to the
       daemon, it will start the daemon and re-run the command. Subsequent invocations of the script will re-use
       the existing daemon.

       Another option is to use systemd socket-based activation (see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.socket.5.html">systemd.socket</a></b>(5)). Here is an example of a
       service unit file and of a socket unit file for the default socket path:

       urxvtd.service
             [Unit]
             Description=urxvt terminal daemon
             Requires=urxvtd.socket

             [Service]
             ExecStart=/usr/bin/urxvtd -o

       urxvtd.socket
             [Unit]
             Description=urxvt terminal daemon socket

             [Socket]
             ListenStream=%h/.urxvt/urxvtd-%H

             [Install]
             WantedBy=sockets.target

       <u>How</u>  <u>do</u>  <u>I</u>  <u>distinguish</u>  <u>whether</u> <u>I'm</u> <u>running</u> <u>rxvt-unicode</u> <u>or</u> <u>a</u> <u>regular</u> <u>xterm?</u> <u>I</u> <u>need</u> <u>this</u> <u>to</u> <u>decide</u> <u>about</u>
       <u>setting</u> <u>colours</u> <u>etc.</u>

       The original rxvt and rxvt-unicode always export the variable "COLORTERM", so you can check  and  see  if
       that  is set. Note that several programs, JED, slrn, Midnight Commander automatically check this variable
       to decide whether or not to use colour.

       <u>How</u> <u>do</u> <u>I</u> <u>set</u> <u>the</u> <u>correct,</u> <u>full</u> <u>IP</u> <u>address</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>DISPLAY</u> <u>variable?</u>

       If you've compiled rxvt-unicode with DISPLAY_IS_IP and have enabled insecure mode then it is possible  to
       use  the  following  shell  script snippets to correctly set the display. If your version of rxvt-unicode
       wasn't also compiled with ESCZ_ANSWER (as assumed in these snippets) then the COLORTERM variable  can  be
       used to distinguish rxvt-unicode from a regular xterm.

       Courtesy of Chuck Blake &lt;<a href="mailto:cblake@BBN.COM">cblake@BBN.COM</a>&gt; with the following shell script snippets:

          # Bourne/Korn/POSIX family of shells:
          [ ${TERM:-foo} = foo ] &amp;&amp; TERM=xterm # assume an xterm if we don't know
          if [ ${TERM:-foo} = xterm ]; then
             stty -icanon -echo min 0 time 15 # see if enhanced rxvt or not
             printf "\eZ"
             read term_id
             stty icanon echo
             if [ ""${term_id} = '^[[?1;2C' -a ${DISPLAY:-foo} = foo ]; then
                printf '\e[7n'        # query the rxvt we are in for the DISPLAY string
                read DISPLAY          # set it in our local shell
             fi
          fi

       <u>How</u> <u>do</u> <u>I</u> <u>compile</u> <u>the</u> <u>manual</u> <u>pages</u> <u>on</u> <u>my</u> <u>own?</u>

       You  need  to  have  a  recent  version  of perl installed as <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a></u>, one that comes with <u>pod2man</u>,
       <u>pod2text</u> and <u>pod2xhtml</u> (from <u>Pod::Xhtml</u>). Then go to the doc subdirectory and enter "make alldoc".

       <u>Isn't</u> <u>rxvt-unicode</u> <u>supposed</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>small?</u> <u>Don't</u> <u>all</u> <u>those</u> <u>features</u> <u>bloat?</u>

       I often get asked about this, and I think, no, they didn't cause extra bloat. If you  compare  a  minimal
       rxvt and a minimal urxvt, you can see that the urxvt binary is larger (due to some encoding tables always
       being   compiled   in),   but   it   actually   uses   less   memory   (RSS)  after  startup.  Even  with
       "--disable-everything", this comparison is a bit unfair,  as  many  features  unique  to  urxvt  (locale,
       encoding conversion, iso14755 etc.) are already in use in this mode.

           text    data     bss     drs     rss filename
          98398    1664      24   15695    1824 rxvt --disable-everything
         188985    9048   66616   18222    1788 urxvt --disable-everything

       When  you  "--enable-everything" (which <u>is</u> unfair, as this involves xft and full locale/XIM support which
       are quite bloaty inside libX11 and my libc), the two diverge, but not unreasonably so.

           text    data     bss     drs     rss filename
         163431    2152      24   20123    2060 rxvt --enable-everything
        1035683   49680   66648   29096    3680 urxvt --enable-everything

       The very large size of the text section is explained by the east-asian encoding tables, which, if unused,
       take up disk space but nothing else and can be compiled out unless you rely on X11 core  fonts  that  use
       those  encodings. The BSS size comes from the 64k emergency buffer that my c++ compiler allocates (but of
       course doesn't use unless you are out of memory). Also,  using  an  xft  font  instead  of  a  core  font
       immediately adds a few megabytes of RSS. Xft indeed is responsible for a lot of RSS even when not used.

       Of  course, due to every character using two or four bytes instead of one, a large scrollback buffer will
       ultimately make rxvt-unicode use more memory.

       Compared to e.g. Eterm (5112k), aterm (3132k) and xterm  (4680k),  this  still  fares  rather  well.  And
       compared  to  some  monsters  like gnome-terminal (21152k + extra 4204k in separate processes) or konsole
       (22200k + extra 43180k in daemons that stay around after exit,  plus  half  a  minute  of  startup  time,
       including the hundreds of warnings it spits out), it fares extremely well *g*.

       <u>Why</u> <u>C++,</u> <u>isn't</u> <u>that</u> <u>unportable/bloated/uncool?</u>

       Is  this  a question? :) It comes up very often. The simple answer is: I had to write it, and C++ allowed
       me to write and maintain it in a fraction of the time and effort (which is a scarce resource for me). Put
       even shorter: It simply wouldn't exist without C++.

       My personal stance on this is that C++ is less portable than C, but in  the  case  of  rxvt-unicode  this
       hardly  matters,  as  its  portability  limits  are  defined by things like X11, pseudo terminals, locale
       support and unix domain sockets, which are all less portable than C++ itself.

       Regarding the bloat, see the above question: It's easy to write programs in C that use  gobs  of  memory,
       and  certainly  possible  to write programs in C++ that don't. C++ also often comes with large libraries,
       but this is not necessarily the case with GCC. Here is what rxvt  links  against  on  my  system  with  a
       minimal config:

          libX11.so.6 =&gt; /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6 (0x00002aaaaabc3000)
          libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00002aaaaadde000)
          libdl.so.2 =&gt; /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00002aaaab01d000)
          <a href="file:/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2">/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</a> (0x00002aaaaaaab000)

       And here is rxvt-unicode:

          libX11.so.6 =&gt; /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6 (0x00002aaaaabc3000)
          libgcc_s.so.1 =&gt; /lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00002aaaaada2000)
          libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00002aaaaaeb0000)
          libdl.so.2 =&gt; /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00002aaaab0ee000)
          <a href="file:/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2">/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</a> (0x00002aaaaaaab000)

       No large bloated libraries (of course, none were linked in statically), except maybe libX11 :)

   <b>Rendering,</b> <b>Font</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Look</b> <b>and</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Issues</b>
       <u>I</u> <u>can't</u> <u>get</u> <u>transparency</u> <u>working,</u> <u>what</u> <u>am</u> <u>I</u> <u>doing</u> <u>wrong?</u>

       First  of all, transparency isn't officially supported in rxvt-unicode, so you are mostly on your own. Do
       not bug the author about it (but you may bug everybody else). Also, if you can't get it working  consider
       it a rite of passage: ... and you failed.

       Here  are  four  ways  to  get transparency. <b>Do</b> read the manpage and option descriptions for the programs
       mentioned and rxvt-unicode. Really, do it!

       1. Use pseudo-transparency:

          Esetroot wallpaper.jpg
          urxvt -tr -tint red -sh 40

       That works. If you think it doesn't, you lack transparency and tinting support,  or  you  are  unable  to
       read.    This   method   requires   that   the  background-setting  program  sets  the  _XROOTPMAP_ID  or
       ESETROOT_PMAP_ID property. Compatible programs are Esetroot, hsetroot and feh.

       2. Use a simple pixmap and emulate pseudo-transparency. This  enables  you  to  use  effects  other  than
       tinting and shading: Just shade/tint/whatever your picture with gimp or any other tool:

          convert wallpaper.jpg -blur 20x20 -modulate 30 background.jpg
          urxvt -pixmap "background.jpg;:root"

       That works. If you think it doesn't, you lack GDK-PixBuf support, or you are unable to read.

       3. Use an ARGB visual:

          urxvt -depth 32 -fg grey90 -bg rgba:0000/0000/4444/cccc

       This requires XFT support, and the support of your X-server. If that doesn't work for you, find a working
       composite manager or window manager, both are required to support ARGB visuals for client windows.

       4. Use xcompmgr and let it do the job:

         xprop -frame -f _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY 32c \
               -set _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY 0xc0000000

       Then  click  on  a  window you want to make transparent. Replace 0xc0000000 by other values to change the
       degree of opacity. If it doesn't work and your server crashes, you got to keep the pieces.

       <u>Why</u> <u>does</u> <u>rxvt-unicode</u> <u>sometimes</u> <u>leave</u> <u>pixel</u> <u>droppings?</u>

       Most fonts were not designed for terminal use, which means that character size varies a lot. A font  that
       is  otherwise  fine for terminal use might contain some characters that are simply too wide. Rxvt-unicode
       will avoid these characters. For characters that are just "a bit" too wide a special "careful"  rendering
       mode is used that redraws adjacent characters.

       All  of  this  requires that fonts do not lie about character sizes, however: Xft fonts often draw glyphs
       larger than their acclaimed bounding box, and rxvt-unicode has no way of detecting this (the correct  way
       is to ask for the character bounding box, which unfortunately is wrong in these cases).

       It's  not  clear (to me at least), whether this is a bug in Xft, freetype, or the respective font. If you
       encounter this problem you might try using the "-lsp" option to  give  the  font  more  height.  If  that
       doesn't work, you might be forced to use a different font.

       All of this is not a problem when using X11 core fonts, as their bounding box data is correct.

       <u>How</u> <u>can</u> <u>I</u> <u>keep</u> <u>rxvt-unicode</u> <u>from</u> <u>using</u> <u>reverse</u> <u>video</u> <u>so</u> <u>much?</u>

       First  of  all,  make  sure you are running with the right terminal settings ("TERM=rxvt-unicode"), which
       will get rid of most of these effects. Then make sure you have specified colours for italic and bold,  as
       otherwise rxvt-unicode might use reverse video to simulate the effect:

          URxvt.colorBD:  white
          URxvt.colorIT:  green

       <u>Some</u> <u>programs</u> <u>assume</u> <u>totally</u> <u>weird</u> <u>colours</u> <u>(red</u> <u>instead</u> <u>of</u> <u>blue),</u> <u>how</u> <u>can</u> <u>I</u> <u>fix</u> <u>that?</u>

       For some unexplainable reason, some rare programs assume a very weird colour palette when confronted with
       a terminal with more than the standard 8 colours (rxvt-unicode supports 88). The right fix is, of course,
       to fix these programs not to assume non-ISO colours without very good reasons.

       In  the  meantime,  you  can  either  edit your "rxvt-unicode" terminfo definition to only claim 8 colour
       support or use "TERM=rxvt", which will fix colours but keep you from using other rxvt-unicode features.

       <u>Can</u> <u>I</u> <u>switch</u> <u>the</u> <u>fonts</u> <u>at</u> <u>runtime?</u>

       Yes, using an escape sequence. Try something like this, which has the same  effect  as  using  the  "-fn"
       switch, and takes effect immediately:

          printf '\33]50;%s\007' "9x15bold,xft:Kochi Gothic"

       This  is  useful  if  you e.g. work primarily with japanese (and prefer a japanese font), but you have to
       switch to chinese temporarily, where japanese fonts would only be in your way.

       You can think of this as a kind of manual ISO-2022 switching.

       <u>Why</u> <u>do</u> <u>italic</u> <u>characters</u> <u>look</u> <u>as</u> <u>if</u> <u>clipped?</u>

       Many fonts have difficulties with italic characters and hinting. For example, the otherwise  very  nicely
       hinted  font "xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono" completely fails in its italic face. A workaround might be to
       enable freetype autohinting, i.e. like this:

          URxvt.italicFont:        xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono:italic:autohint=true
          URxvt.boldItalicFont:    xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono:bold:italic:autohint=true

       <u>Can</u> <u>I</u> <u>speed</u> <u>up</u> <u>Xft</u> <u>rendering</u> <u>somehow?</u>

       Yes, the most obvious way to speed it up is to avoid Xft entirely, as it is simply  slow.  If  you  still
       want  Xft fonts you might try to disable antialiasing (by appending ":antialias=false"), which saves lots
       of memory and also speeds up rendering considerably.

       <u>Rxvt-unicode</u> <u>doesn't</u> <u>seem</u> <u>to</u> <u>anti-alias</u> <u>its</u> <u>fonts,</u> <u>what</u> <u>is</u> <u>wrong?</u>

       Rxvt-unicode will use whatever you specify as a font. If it needs to fall back to its default font search
       list it will prefer X11 core fonts, because they are small and fast, and  then  use  Xft  fonts.  It  has
       antialiasing disabled for most of them, because the author thinks they look best that way.

       If you want antialiasing, you have to specify the fonts manually.

       <u>What's</u> <u>with</u> <u>this</u> <u>bold/blink</u> <u>stuff?</u>

       If no bold colour is set via "colorBD:", bold will invert text using the standard foreground colour.

       For  the  standard  background  colour,  blinking  will  actually  make the text blink when compiled with
       "--enable-text-blink". Without "--enable-text-blink", the blink attribute will be ignored.

       On ANSI colours, bold/blink attributes are used to set high-intensity foreground/background colours.

       color0-7 are the low-intensity colours.

       color8-15 are the corresponding high-intensity colours.

       <u>I</u> <u>don't</u> <u>like</u> <u>the</u> <u>screen</u> <u>colours.</u>  <u>How</u> <u>do</u> <u>I</u> <u>change</u> <u>them?</u>

       You can change the screen colours at run-time using <u><a href="file:~/.Xdefaults">~/.Xdefaults</a></u> resources (or as long-options).

       Here are values that are supposed to resemble a VGA screen, including the murky  brown  that  passes  for
       low-intensity yellow:

          URxvt.color0:   #000000
          URxvt.color1:   #A80000
          URxvt.color2:   #00A800
          URxvt.color3:   #A8A800
          URxvt.color4:   #0000A8

       <u>Why</u> <u>do</u> <u>some</u> <u>characters</u> <u>look</u> <u>so</u> <u>much</u> <u>different</u> <u>than</u> <u>others?</u>

       See next entry.

       <u>How</u> <u>does</u> <u>rxvt-unicode</u> <u>choose</u> <u>fonts?</u>

       Most fonts do not contain the full range of Unicode, which is fine. Chances are that the font you (or the
       admin/package  maintainer of your system/os) have specified does not cover all the characters you want to
       display.

       <b>rxvt-unicode</b> makes a best-effort try at finding a  replacement  font.  Often  the  result  is  fine,  but
       sometimes  the  chosen  font  looks bad/ugly/wrong. Some fonts have totally strange characters that don't
       resemble the correct glyph at all, and rxvt-unicode lacks the artificial intelligence to  detect  that  a
       specific  glyph is wrong: it has to believe the font that the characters it claims to contain indeed look
       correct.

       In that case, select a font of your taste and add it to the font list, e.g.:

          urxvt -fn basefont,font2,font3...

       When rxvt-unicode sees a character, it will first look at the base  font.  If  the  base  font  does  not
       contain  the character, it will go to the next font, and so on. Specifying your own fonts will also speed
       up this search and use less resources within rxvt-unicode and the X-server.

       The only limitation is that none of the fonts may be larger than the base font, as the base font  defines
       the terminal character cell size, which must be the same due to the way terminals work.

       <u>Why</u> <u>do</u> <u>some</u> <u>chinese</u> <u>characters</u> <u>look</u> <u>so</u> <u>different</u> <u>than</u> <u>others?</u>

       This  is  because  there  is a difference between script and language -- rxvt-unicode does not know which
       language the text that is output is, as it only knows the unicode character codes. If rxvt-unicode  first
       sees  a  japanese/chinese  character,  it  might  choose a japanese font for display. Subsequent japanese
       characters will use that font. Now, many chinese characters aren't represented in japanese fonts, so when
       the first non-japanese character comes up, rxvt-unicode will look for a chinese font -- unfortunately  at
       this  point,  it  will  still  use the japanese font for chinese characters that are also in the japanese
       font.

       The workaround is easy: just tag a chinese font at the end of your font list (see the previous question).
       The key is to view the font list as a preference list: If you expect more japanese, list a japanese  font
       first. If you expect more chinese, put a chinese font first.

       In the future it might be possible to switch language preferences at runtime (the internal data structure
       has  no  problem with using different fonts for the same character at the same time, but no interface for
       this has been designed yet).

       Until then, you might get away with switching fonts at runtime (see "Can I switch the fonts at  runtime?"
       later in this document).

       <u>How</u> <u>can</u> <u>I</u> <u>make</u> <u>mplayer</u> <u>display</u> <u>video</u> <u>correctly?</u>

       We are working on it, in the meantime, as a workaround, use something like:

          urxvt -b 600 -geometry 20x1 -e sh -c 'mplayer -wid $WINDOWID file...'

       <u>Why</u> <u>is</u> <u>the</u> <u>cursor</u> <u>now</u> <u>blinking</u> <u>in</u> <u>emacs/vi/...?</u>

       This  is  likely caused by your editor/program's use of the "cvvis" terminfo capability. Emacs uses it by
       default, as well as some versions of vi and possibly other programs.

       In emacs, you can switch that off by adding this to your ".emacs" file:

          (setq visible-cursor nil)

       For other programs, if they do not have an option, your have to remove the "cvvis"  capability  from  the
       terminfo description.

       When  urxvt  first  added the blinking cursor option, it didn't add a "cvvis" capability, which served no
       purpose before. Version 9.21 introduced "cvvis" (and the  ability  to  control  blinking  independent  of
       cursor  shape)  for  compatibility  with  other  terminals, which traditionally use a blinking cursor for
       "cvvis". This also reflects the intent of programs such as emacs, who expect "cvvis" to enable a blinking
       cursor.

   <b>Keyboard,</b> <b>Mouse</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>User</b> <b>Interaction</b>
       <u>The</u> <u>new</u> <u>selection</u> <u>selects</u> <u>pieces</u> <u>that</u> <u>are</u> <u>too</u> <u>big,</u> <u>how</u> <u>can</u> <u>I</u> <u>select</u> <u>single</u> <u>words?</u>

       If you want to select e.g. alphanumeric words, you can use the following setting:

          URxvt.selection.pattern-0: ([[:word:]]+)

       If you click more than twice, the selection will be extended more and more.

       To get a selection that is very similar to the old code, try this pattern:

          URxvt.selection.pattern-0: ([^"&amp;'()*,;&lt;=&gt;?@[\\\\]^`{|})]+)

       Please also note that the <u>LeftClick</u> <u>Shift-LeftClick</u> combination also selects words like the old code.

       <u>I</u> <u>don't</u> <u>like</u> <u>the</u> <u>new</u> <u>selection/popups/hotkeys/perl,</u> <u>how</u> <u>do</u> <u>I</u> <u>change/disable</u> <u>it?</u>

       You can disable the perl extension completely by  setting  the  <b>perl-ext-common</b>  resource  to  the  empty
       string, which also keeps rxvt-unicode from initialising perl, saving memory.

       If  you  only  want  to  disable  specific  features,  you first have to identify which perl extension is
       responsible. For this, read the section <b>PREPACKAGED</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b> in the urxvt<b><a href="../man3/perl.3.html">perl</a></b>(3) manpage. For  example,
       to disable the <b>selection-popup</b> and <b>option-popup</b>, specify this <b>perl-ext-common</b> resource:

          URxvt.perl-ext-common: default,-selection-popup,-option-popup

       This  will keep the default extensions, but disable the two popup extensions. Some extensions can also be
       configured, for example, scrollback search mode is triggered by  <b>M-s</b>.  You  can  move  it  to  any  other
       combination  by  adding  a  <b>keysym</b>  resource  that binds the desired combination to the "start" action of
       "searchable-scrollback" and another one that binds <b>M-s</b> to the "builtin:" action:

          URxvt.keysym.CM-s: searchable-scrollback:start
          URxvt.keysym.M-s: builtin:

       <u>The</u> <u>cursor</u> <u>moves</u> <u>when</u> <u>selecting</u> <u>text</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>current</u> <u>input</u> <u>line,</u> <u>how</u> <u>do</u> <u>I</u> <u>switch</u> <u>this</u> <u>off?</u>

       See next entry.

       <u>During</u> <u>rlogin/ssh/telnet/etc.</u> <u>sessions,</u> <u>clicking</u> <u>near</u> <u>the</u> <u>cursor</u> <u>outputs</u> <u>strange</u> <u>escape</u> <u>sequences,</u> <u>how</u> <u>do</u>
       <u>I</u> <u>fix</u> <u>this?</u>

       These are caused by the "readline" perl extension. Under normal circumstances, it will move  your  cursor
       around  when  you click into the line that contains it. It tries hard not to do this at the wrong moment,
       but when running a program that doesn't parse cursor movements or in some cases during  rlogin  sessions,
       it fails to detect this properly.

       You can permanently switch this feature off by disabling the "readline" extension:

          URxvt.perl-ext-common: default,-readline

       <u>My</u> <u>numeric</u> <u>keypad</u> <u>acts</u> <u>weird</u> <u>and</u> <u>generates</u> <u>differing</u> <u>output?</u>

       Some Debian GNU/Linux users seem to have this problem, although no specific details were reported so far.
       It  is  possible that this is caused by the wrong "TERM" setting, although the details of whether and how
       this can happen are unknown, as "TERM=rxvt" should offer a compatible  keymap.  See  the  answer  to  the
       previous question, and please report if that helped.

       <u>My</u> <u>Compose</u> <u>(Multi_key)</u> <u>key</u> <u>is</u> <u>no</u> <u>longer</u> <u>working.</u>

       The  most  common  causes  for  this are that either your locale is not set correctly, or you specified a
       <b>preeditType</b> that is not supported by your input method. For example, if  you  specified  <b>OverTheSpot</b>  and
       your  input  method  (e.g.  the  default  input  method handling Compose keys) does not support this (for
       instance because it is not visual), then rxvt-unicode will continue without an input method.

       In this case either do not specify a <b>preeditType</b> or  specify  more  than  one  pre-edit  style,  such  as
       <b>OverTheSpot,Root,None</b>.

       If  it  still doesn't work, then maybe your input method doesn't support compose sequences - to fall back
       to the built-in one, make sure you don't specify an input method via "-im" or "XMODIFIERS".

       <u>I</u> <u>cannot</u> <u>type</u> <u>"Ctrl-Shift-2"</u> <u>to</u> <u>get</u> <u>an</u> <u>ASCII</u> <u>NUL</u> <u>character</u> <u>due</u> <u>to</u> <u>ISO</u> <u>14755</u>

       Either try "Ctrl-2" alone (it often is mapped to ASCII NUL even on international keyboards) or simply use
       ISO 14755 support to your advantage, typing &lt;Ctrl-Shift-0&gt; to get a  ASCII  NUL.  This  works  for  other
       codes, too, such as "Ctrl-Shift-1-d" to type the default telnet escape character and so on.

       <u>Mouse</u> <u>cut/paste</u> <u>suddenly</u> <u>no</u> <u>longer</u> <u>works.</u>

       Make sure that mouse reporting is actually turned off since killing some editors prematurely may leave it
       active.  I've  heard that tcsh may use mouse reporting unless it is otherwise specified. A quick check is
       to see if cut/paste works when the Alt or Shift keys are pressed.

       <u>What's</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>strange</u> <u>Backspace/Delete</u> <u>key</u> <u>behaviour?</u>

       Assuming that the physical Backspace key corresponds to the Backspace keysym (not likely  for  Linux  ...
       see the following question) there are two standard values that can be used for Backspace: "^H" and "^?".

       Historically,  either  value  is  correct,  but  rxvt-unicode adopts the debian policy of using "^?" when
       unsure, because it's the one and only correct choice :).

       It is possible to toggle between "^H" and "^?" with the DECBKM private mode:

          # use Backspace = ^H
          $ stty erase ^H
          $ printf "\e[?67h"

          # use Backspace = ^?
          $ stty erase ^?
          $ printf "\e[?67l"

       This helps satisfy some of the Backspace discrepancies that occur, but if you use Backspace = "^H",  make
       sure that the termcap/terminfo value properly reflects that.

       The  Delete  key  is a another casualty of the ill-defined Backspace problem.  To avoid confusion between
       the Backspace and Delete keys, the Delete key has been assigned an escape sequence to match the vt100 for
       Execute ("ESC [ 3 ~") and is in the supplied termcap/terminfo.

       Some other Backspace problems:

       some editors use termcap/terminfo, some editors (vim I'm told) expect Backspace  =  ^H,  GNU  Emacs  (and
       Emacs-like editors) use ^H for help.

       Perhaps someday this will all be resolved in a consistent manner.

       <u>I</u> <u>don't</u> <u>like</u> <u>the</u> <u>key-bindings.</u>  <u>How</u> <u>do</u> <u>I</u> <u>change</u> <u>them?</u>

       There  are some compile-time selections available via configure. Unless you have run "configure" with the
       "--disable-resources" option you can use the `keysym' resource to alter the  keystrings  associated  with
       keysyms.

       Here's an example for a URxvt session started using "urxvt -name URxvt"

          URxvt.keysym.Prior:         \033[5~
          URxvt.keysym.Next:          \033[6~
          URxvt.keysym.Home:          \033[7~
          URxvt.keysym.End:           \033[8~
          URxvt.keysym.Up:            \033[A
          URxvt.keysym.Down:          \033[B
          URxvt.keysym.Right:         \033[C
          URxvt.keysym.Left:          \033[D

       See some more examples in the documentation for the <b>keysym</b> resource.

       <u>I'm</u>  <u>using</u>  <u>keyboard</u>  <u>model</u>  <u>XXX</u>  <u>that</u>  <u>has</u>  <u>extra</u> <u>Prior/Next/Insert</u> <u>keys.</u> <u>How</u> <u>do</u> <u>I</u> <u>make</u> <u>use</u> <u>of</u> <u>them?</u> <u>For</u>
       <u>example,</u> <u>the</u> <u>Sun</u> <u>Keyboard</u> <u>type</u> <u>4</u> <u>has</u> <u>the</u> <u>following</u> <u>map</u>

          KP_Insert == Insert
          F22 == Print
          F27 == Home
          F29 == Prior
          F33 == End
          F35 == Next

       Rather than have rxvt-unicode try to accommodate all the various possible keyboard mappings, it is better
       to use `xmodmap' to remap the keys as required for your particular machine.

   <b>Terminal</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       <u>Can</u> <u>I</u> <u>see</u> <u>a</u> <u>typical</u> <u>configuration?</u>

       The default configuration tries to be xterm-like, which I don't like that much, but it's  least  surprise
       to regular users.

       As  a  rxvt  or  rxvt-unicode  user,  you  are  practically supposed to invest time into customising your
       terminal. To get you started, here is the author's .Xdefaults entries, with comments  on  what  they  do.
       It's certainly not <u>typical</u>, but what's typical...

          URxvt.cutchars: "()*,&lt;&gt;[]{}|'
          URxvt.print-pipe: cat &gt;/some/path

       These are just for testing stuff.

          URxvt.imLocale: ja_JP.UTF-8
          URxvt.preeditType: OnTheSpot,None

       This  tells  rxvt-unicode  to  use  a special locale when communicating with the X Input Method, and also
       tells it to only use the OnTheSpot pre-edit type, which requires the "xim-onthespot" perl  extension  but
       rewards me with correct-looking fonts.

          URxvt.perl-lib: /root/lib/urxvt
          URxvt.perl-ext-common: default,selection-autotransform,selection-pastebin,xim-onthespot,remote-clipboard
          URxvt.selection.pattern-0: ( at .*? line \\d+)
          URxvt.selection.pattern-1: ^(/[^:]+):\
          URxvt.selection-autotransform.0: s/^([^:[:space:]]+):(\\d+):?$/:e \\Q$1\\E\\x0d:$2\\x0d/
          URxvt.selection-autotransform.1: s/^ at (.*?) line (\\d+)$/:e \\Q$1\\E\\x0d:$2\\x0d/

       This is my perl configuration. The first two set the perl library directory and also tells urxvt to use a
       large  number  of  extensions.  I  develop  for myself mostly, so I actually use most of the extensions I
       write.

       The selection stuff mainly makes the selection perl-error-message aware and  tells  it  to  convert  perl
       error messages into vi-commands to load the relevant file and go to the error line number.

          URxvt.scrollstyle:      plain
          URxvt.secondaryScroll:  true

       As  the  documentation  says:  plain  is  the  preferred  scrollbar for the author. The "secondaryScroll"
       configures urxvt to scroll in full-screen apps, like screen, so lines scrolled out of screen  end  up  in
       urxvt's scrollback buffer.

          URxvt.background:       #000000
          URxvt.foreground:       gray90
          URxvt.color7:           gray90
          URxvt.colorBD:          #ffffff
          URxvt.cursorColor:      #e0e080
          URxvt.throughColor:     #8080f0
          URxvt.highlightColor:   #f0f0f0

       Some  colours.  Not  sure which ones are being used or even non-defaults, but these are in my .Xdefaults.
       Most notably, they set foreground/background to light gray/black, and also make sure that  the  colour  7
       matches the default foreground colour.

          URxvt.underlineColor:   yellow

       Another colour, makes underline lines look different. Sometimes hurts, but is mostly a nice effect.

          URxvt.geometry:         154x36
          URxvt.loginShell:       false
          URxvt.meta:             ignore
          URxvt.utmpInhibit:      true

       Uh,  well,  should be mostly self-explanatory. By specifying some defaults manually, I can quickly switch
       them for testing.

          URxvt.saveLines:        8192

       A large scrollback buffer is essential. Really.

          URxvt.mapAlert:         true

       The only case I use it is for my IRC window, which I like to keep iconified till  people  msg  me  (which
       beeps).

          URxvt.visualBell:       true

       The audible bell is often annoying, especially when in a crowd.

          URxvt.insecure:         true

       Please don't hack my mutt! Ooops...

          URxvt.pastableTabs:     false

       I once thought this is a great idea.

          urxvt.font:             9x15bold,\
                                  -misc-fixed-bold-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1,\
                                  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1, \
                                  [codeset=JISX0208]xft:Kochi Gothic, \
                                  xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono:autohint=true, \
                                  xft:Code2000:antialias=false
          urxvt.boldFont:         -xos4-terminus-bold-r-normal--14-140-72-72-c-80-iso8859-15
          urxvt.italicFont:       xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono:italic:autohint=true
          urxvt.boldItalicFont:   xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono:bold:italic:autohint=true

       I  wrote  rxvt-unicode  to be able to specify fonts exactly. So don't be overwhelmed. A special note: the
       "9x15bold" mentioned above is actually the version from XFree-3.3, as XFree-4 replaced it  by  a  totally
       different  font  (different  glyphs for ";" and many other harmless characters), while the second font is
       actually the "9x15bold" from XFree4/XOrg. The bold version has less chars than the medium version,  so  I
       use  it  for  rare  characters,  too.  When editing sources with vim, I use italic for comments and other
       stuff, which looks quite good with Bitstream Vera anti-aliased.

       Terminus is a quite bad font (many very wrong glyphs), but for most of my purposes, it works, and gives a
       different look, as my normal (Non-bold) font is already bold, and I want to see a difference between bold
       and normal fonts.

       Please note that I used the "urxvt" instance name and not the "URxvt" class name. That is because  I  use
       different  configs  for  different  purposes, for example, my IRC window is started with "-name IRC", and
       uses these defaults:

          IRC*title:              IRC
          IRC*geometry:           87x12+535+542
          IRC*saveLines:          0
          IRC*mapAlert:           true
          IRC*font:               suxuseuro

       "Alt-Ctrl-1" and "Alt-Ctrl-2" switch between two different font sizes. "suxuseuro" allows me to  keep  an
       eye (and actually read) stuff while keeping a very small window. If somebody pastes something complicated
       (e.g. japanese), I temporarily switch to a larger font.

       The above is all in my ".Xdefaults" (I don't use ".Xresources" nor "xrdb"). I also have some resources in
       a separate ".Xdefaults-hostname" file for different hosts, for example, on my main desktop, I use:

          URxvt.keysym.C-M-q: command:\033[3;5;5t
          URxvt.keysym.C-M-y: command:\033[3;5;606t
          URxvt.keysym.C-M-e: command:\033[3;1605;5t
          URxvt.keysym.C-M-c: command:\033[3;1605;606t
          URxvt.keysym.C-M-p: perl:test

       The  first  for  keysym definitions allow me to quickly bring some windows in the layout I like most. Ion
       users might start laughing but will stop immediately when I tell them that I use my own Fvwm2 module  for
       much the same effect as Ion provides, and I only very rarely use the above key combinations :-&gt;

       <u>Why</u> <u>doesn't</u> <u>rxvt-unicode</u> <u>read</u> <u>my</u> <u>resources?</u>

       Well,  why,  indeed? It does, in a way very similar to other X applications. Most importantly, this means
       that if you or your OS loads resources into the X display (the right way to  do  it),  rxvt-unicode  will
       ignore  any  resource  files in your home directory. It will only read <u>$HOME/.Xdefaults</u> when no resources
       are attached to the display.

       If you have or use an <u>$HOME/.Xresources</u> file, chances are that resources are loaded into  your  X-server.
       In this case, you have to re-login after every change (or run <u>xrdb</u> <u>-merge</u> <u>$HOME/.Xresources</u>).

       Also consider the form resources have to use:

         URxvt.resource: value

       If you want to use another form (there are lots of different ways of specifying resources), make sure you
       understand whether and why it works. If unsure, use the form above.

       <u>When</u> <u>I</u> <u>log-in</u> <u>to</u> <u>another</u> <u>system</u> <u>it</u> <u>tells</u> <u>me</u> <u>about</u> <u>missing</u> <u>terminfo</u> <u>data?</u>

       The  terminal description used by rxvt-unicode is not as widely available as that for xterm, or even rxvt
       (for which the same problem often arises).

       The correct solution for this problem is to install the terminfo, this can be done by  simply  installing
       rxvt-unicode  on  the  remote  system as well (in case you have a nice package manager ready), or you can
       install the terminfo database manually like this (with ncurses infocmp. works as user and root):

          REMOTE=remotesystem.domain
          infocmp rxvt-unicode-256color | \
               ssh $REMOTE 'export TMPF=`mktemp` &amp;&amp; mkdir -p <a href="file:~/.terminfo">~/.terminfo</a> \
                            &amp;&amp; cat &gt;${TMPF} &amp;&amp; tic ${TMPF} &amp;&amp; rm ${TMPF}'

       One some systems you might need to set $TERMINFO to the full path of <u>$HOME/.terminfo</u> for this to work.

       If you cannot or do not want to do this, then you can simply set "TERM=rxvt" or  even  "TERM=xterm",  and
       live  with  the  small  number  of  problems arising, which includes wrong keymapping, less and different
       colours and some refresh errors in fullscreen applications. It's a nice  quick-and-dirty  workaround  for
       rare cases, though.

       If  you always want to do this (and are fine with the consequences) you can either recompile rxvt-unicode
       with the desired TERM value or use a resource to set it:

          URxvt.termName: rxvt

       If you don't plan to use <b>rxvt</b> (quite common...) you could also replace the rxvt terminfo  file  with  the
       rxvt-unicode one and use "TERM=rxvt".

       <u>nano</u> <u>fails</u> <u>with</u> <u>"Error</u> <u>opening</u> <u>terminal:</u> <u>rxvt-unicode"</u>

       This exceptionally confusing and useless error message is printed by nano when it can't find the terminfo
       database. Nothing is wrong with your terminal, read the previous answer for a solution.

       <u>"tic"</u> <u>outputs</u> <u>some</u> <u>error</u> <u>when</u> <u>compiling</u> <u>the</u> <u>terminfo</u> <u>entry.</u>

       Most likely it's the empty definition for "enacs=". Just replace it by "enacs=\E[0@" and try again.

       <u>"bash"'s</u> <u>readline</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>work</u> <u>correctly</u> <u>under</u> <u>urxvt.</u>

       See next entry.

       <u>I</u> <u>need</u> <u>a</u> <u>termcap</u> <u>file</u> <u>entry.</u>

       One  reason  you  might  want  this  is  that  some distributions or operating systems still compile some
       programs using the long-obsoleted termcap library (Fedora's bash is one example) and rely  on  a  termcap
       entry for "rxvt-unicode".

       You  could use rxvt's termcap entry with reasonable results in many cases.  You can also create a termcap
       entry by using terminfo's infocmp program like this:

          infocmp -C rxvt-unicode

       Or you could use the termcap entry in doc/etc/rxvt-unicode.termcap, generated by the command above.

       <u>Why</u> <u>does</u> <u>"ls"</u> <u>no</u> <u>longer</u> <u>have</u> <u>coloured</u> <u>output?</u>

       The "ls" in the GNU coreutils unfortunately doesn't use terminfo to decide whether a terminal has colour,
       but uses its own configuration file. Needless to say, "rxvt-unicode" is not in its  default  file  (among
       with most other terminals supporting colour). Either add:

          TERM rxvt-unicode

       to "/etc/DIR_COLORS" or simply add:

          alias ls='ls --color=auto'

       to your ".profile" or ".bashrc".

       <u>Why</u> <u>doesn't</u> <u>vim/emacs</u> <u>etc.</u> <u>use</u> <u>the</u> <u>88</u> <u>colour</u> <u>mode?</u>

       See next entry.

       <u>Why</u> <u>are</u> <u>the</u> <u>secondary</u> <u>screen-related</u> <u>options</u> <u>not</u> <u>working</u> <u>properly?</u>

       Make  sure  you  are  using  "TERM=rxvt-unicode".  Some  pre-packaged distributions break rxvt-unicode by
       setting "TERM" to "rxvt",  which  doesn't  have  these  extra  features.  Unfortunately,  some  of  these
       furthermore fail to even install the "rxvt-unicode" terminfo file, so you will need to install it on your
       own  (See the question <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>log-in</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>system</b> <b>it</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>missing</b> <b>terminfo</b> <b>data?</b> on how to
       do this).

   <b>Encoding</b> <b>/</b> <b>Locale</b> <b>/</b> <b>Input</b> <b>Method</b> <b>Issues</b>
       <u>Rxvt-unicode</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>seem</u> <u>to</u> <u>understand</u> <u>the</u> <u>selected</u> <u>encoding?</u>

       See next entry.

       <u>Unicode</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>seem</u> <u>to</u> <u>work?</u>

       If you encounter strange problems like typing an accented  character  but  getting  two  unrelated  other
       characters  or  similar,  or  if  program  output  is  subtly  garbled, then you should check your locale
       settings.

       Rxvt-unicode must be started with the same "LC_CTYPE" setting as the programs running in it. Often  rxvt-
       unicode  is  started  in  the  "C"  locale, while the login script running within the rxvt-unicode window
       changes the locale to something else, e.g. "en_GB.UTF-8". Needless to say, this is not going to work, and
       is the most common cause for problems.

       The best thing is to fix your startup environment, as you will likely run into other problems. If nothing
       works you can try this in your .profile.

         printf '\33]701;%s\007' "$LC_CTYPE"   # $LANG or $LC_ALL are worth a try, too

       If this doesn't work, then maybe you use a "LC_CTYPE" specification not supported on your  systems.  Some
       systems  have  a  "locale"  command  which  displays  this  (also, "perl -e0" can be used to check locale
       settings, as it will complain loudly if it cannot set the locale). If it displays something like:

         locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: ...

       Then the locale you specified is not supported on your system.

       If nothing works and you are sure that everything is set correctly then  you  will  need  to  remember  a
       little known fact: Some programs just don't support locales :(

       <u>How</u> <u>does</u> <u>rxvt-unicode</u> <u>determine</u> <u>the</u> <u>encoding</u> <u>to</u> <u>use?</u>

       See next entry.

       <u>Is</u> <u>there</u> <u>an</u> <u>option</u> <u>to</u> <u>switch</u> <u>encodings?</u>

       Unlike  some  other terminals, rxvt-unicode has no encoding switch, and no specific "utf-8" mode, such as
       xterm. In fact, it doesn't even know about UTF-8 or any other encodings with respect to terminal I/O.

       The reasons is that there exists a perfectly fine mechanism for selecting the  encoding,  doing  I/O  and
       (most  important) communicating this to all applications so everybody agrees on character properties such
       as width and code number. This mechanism is the <u>locale</u>.  Applications  not  using  that  info  will  have
       problems  (for example, "xterm" gets the width of characters wrong as it uses its own, locale-independent
       table under all locales).

       Rxvt-unicode uses the "LC_CTYPE" locale category to select encoding. All programs doing  the  same  (that
       is, most) will automatically agree in the interpretation of characters.

       Unfortunately,  there  is  no  system-independent  way  to select locales, nor is there a standard on how
       locale specifiers will look like.

       On most systems, the content of the "LC_CTYPE" environment variable contains an  arbitrary  string  which
       corresponds   to   an   already-installed   locale.   Common   names   for   locales  are  "en_US.UTF-8",
       "de_DE.ISO-8859-15", "ja_JP.EUC-JP", i.e. "language_country.encoding", but  other  forms  (i.e.  "de"  or
       "german") are also common.

       Rxvt-unicode  ignores  all  other  locale  categories,  and  except  for the encoding, ignores country or
       language-specific settings, i.e. "de_DE.UTF-8" and "ja_JP.UTF-8" are the normally same to rxvt-unicode.

       If you want to use a specific encoding you have to make sure you  start  rxvt-unicode  with  the  correct
       "LC_CTYPE" category.

       <u>Can</u> <u>I</u> <u>switch</u> <u>locales</u> <u>at</u> <u>runtime?</u>

       Yes, using an escape sequence. Try something like this, which sets rxvt-unicode's idea of "LC_CTYPE".

         printf '\33]701;%s\007' ja_JP.SJIS

       See also the previous answer.

       Sometimes  this  capability  is rather handy when you want to work in one locale (e.g. "de_DE.UTF-8") but
       some programs don't support it (e.g. UTF-8). For example, I use this script to start "xjdic", which first
       switches to a locale supported by xjdic and back later:

          printf '\33]701;%s\007' ja_JP.SJIS
          xjdic -js
          printf '\33]701;%s\007' de_DE.UTF-8

       You can also use xterm's "luit" program,  which  usually  works  fine,  except  for  some  locales  where
       character width differs between program- and rxvt-unicode-locales.

       <u>I</u> <u>have</u> <u>problems</u> <u>getting</u> <u>my</u> <u>input</u> <u>method</u> <u>working.</u>

       Try a search engine, as this is slightly different for every input method server.

       Here is a checklist:

       - Make sure your locale <u>and</u> the imLocale are supported on your OS.
           Try "locale -a" or check the documentation for your OS.

       - Make sure your locale or imLocale matches a locale supported by your XIM.
           For example, <b>kinput2</b> does not support UTF-8 locales, you should use "ja_JP.EUC-JP" or equivalent.

       - Make sure your XIM server is actually running.
       - Make sure the "XMODIFIERS" environment variable is set correctly when <u>starting</u> rxvt-unicode.
           When you want to use e.g. <b>kinput2</b>, it must be set to "@im=kinput2". For <b>scim</b>, use "@im=SCIM". You can
           see what input method servers are running with this command:

              xprop -root XIM_SERVERS

       <u>My</u> <u>input</u> <u>method</u> <u>wants</u> <u>&lt;some</u> <u>encoding&gt;</u> <u>but</u> <u>I</u> <u>want</u> <u>UTF-8,</u> <u>what</u> <u>can</u> <u>I</u> <u>do?</u>

       You  can  specify  separate locales for the input method and the rest of the terminal, using the resource
       "imlocale":

          URxvt.imlocale: ja_JP.EUC-JP

       Now you can start your terminal with "LC_CTYPE=ja_JP.UTF-8" and still use your input method. Please note,
       however, that, depending on your Xlib version, you may not be able to input characters  outside  "EUC-JP"
       in a normal way then, as your input method limits you.

       <u>Rxvt-unicode</u> <u>crashes</u> <u>when</u> <u>the</u> <u>X</u> <u>Input</u> <u>Method</u> <u>changes</u> <u>or</u> <u>exits.</u>

       Unfortunately,  this  is  unavoidable, as the XIM protocol is racy by design. Applications can avoid some
       crashes at the expense of memory leaks, and Input Methods can avoid some crashes by careful  ordering  at
       exit  time. <b>kinput2</b> (and derived input methods) generally succeeds, while <b>SCIM</b> (or similar input methods)
       fails. In the end, however, crashes cannot be completely avoided even if both sides cooperate.

       So the only workaround is not to kill your Input Method Servers.

   <b>Operating</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>/</b> <b>Package</b> <b>Maintaining</b>
       <u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>maintaining</u> <u>rxvt-unicode</u> <u>for</u> <u>distribution/OS</u> <u>XXX,</u> <u>any</u> <u>recommendation?</u>

       You should build one binary with the default options. <u>configure</u> now enables most useful options, and  the
       trend  goes  to  making  them  runtime-switchable, too, so there is usually no drawback to enabling them,
       except higher disk and possibly memory usage. The  perl  interpreter  should  be  enabled,  as  important
       functionality (menus, selection, likely more in the future) depends on it.

       You  should  not  overwrite the "perl-ext-common" and "perl-ext" resources system-wide (except maybe with
       "defaults"). This will result in useful behaviour. If your distribution aims at low memory, add an  empty
       "perl-ext-common"  resource  to the app-defaults file. This will keep the perl interpreter disabled until
       the user enables it.

       If you can/want build more binaries, I recommend building a minimal one with "--disable-everything" (very
       useful) and a maximal one with "--enable-everything" (less useful, it will be very big due to  a  lot  of
       encodings built-in that increase download times and are rarely used).

       <u>I</u> <u>need</u> <u>to</u> <u>make</u> <u>it</u> <u>setuid/setgid</u> <u>to</u> <u>support</u> <u>utmp/ptys</u> <u>on</u> <u>my</u> <u>OS,</u> <u>is</u> <u>this</u> <u>safe?</u>

       It  should  be,  starting  with release 7.1. You are encouraged to properly install urxvt with privileges
       necessary for your OS now.

       When rxvt-unicode detects that it runs setuid  or  setgid,  it  will  fork  into  a  helper  process  for
       privileged  operations  (pty  handling  on  some  systems, utmp/wtmp/lastlog handling on others) and drop
       privileges immediately. This is much safer than most other terminals that keep privileges  while  running
       (but  is  more relevant to urxvt, as it contains things as perl interpreters, which might be "helpful" to
       attackers).

       This forking is done as the very first within <b>main()</b>, which is very early and reduces  possible  bugs  to
       initialisation  code  run  before  <b>main()</b>, or things like the dynamic loader of your system, which should
       result in very little risk.

       <u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>on</u> <u>FreeBSD</u> <u>and</u> <u>rxvt-unicode</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>seem</u> <u>to</u> <u>work</u> <u>at</u> <u>all.</u>

       Rxvt-unicode requires the symbol "__STDC_ISO_10646__" to be defined in your compile  environment,  or  an
       implementation  that  implements  it, whether it defines the symbol or not. "__STDC_ISO_10646__" requires
       that <b>wchar_t</b> is represented as unicode.

       As you might have guessed, FreeBSD does neither define this symbol nor does it support  it.  Instead,  it
       uses  its  own  internal  representation  of <b>wchar_t</b>. This is, of course, completely fine with respect to
       standards.

       However, that means rxvt-unicode only works in "POSIX", "ISO-8859-1" and "UTF-8"  locales  under  FreeBSD
       (which all use Unicode as <b>wchar_t</b>).

       "__STDC_ISO_10646__"  is  the  only  sane way to support multi-language apps in an OS, as using a locale-
       dependent (and non-standardized) representation of <b>wchar_t</b> makes it impossible to convert between <b>wchar_t</b>
       (as used by X11 and your applications) and any other encoding without  implementing  OS-specific-wrappers
       for  each  and every locale. There simply are no APIs to convert <b>wchar_t</b> into anything except the current
       locale encoding.

       Some applications (such as the formidable <b>mlterm</b>) work around this  by  carrying  their  own  replacement
       functions  for  character  set  handling  with  them, and either implementing OS-dependent hacks or doing
       multiple conversions (which is slow and unreliable in case the OS implements encodings slightly different
       than the terminal emulator).

       The rxvt-unicode author insists that the right way to fix this is in the system libraries  once  and  for
       all, instead of forcing every app to carry complete replacements for them :)

       <u>How</u> <u>can</u> <u>I</u> <u>use</u> <u>rxvt-unicode</u> <u>under</u> <u>cygwin?</u>

       rxvt-unicode  should  compile  and  run  out of the box on cygwin, using the X11 libraries that come with
       cygwin. libW11 emulation is no longer supported (and makes no sense,  either,  as  it  only  supported  a
       single font). I recommend starting the X-server in "-multiwindow" or "-rootless" mode instead, which will
       result in similar look&amp;feel as the old libW11 emulation.

       At  the  time  of  this  writing,  cygwin  didn't seem to support any multi-byte encodings (you might try
       "LC_CTYPE=C-UTF-8"), so you are likely limited to 8-bit encodings.

       <u>Character</u> <u>widths</u> <u>are</u> <u>not</u> <u>correct.</u>

       urxvt uses the system wcwidth function to know the information about  the  width  of  characters,  so  on
       systems with incorrect locale data you will likely get bad results. Two notorious examples are Solaris 9,
       where  single-width  characters  like  U+2514 are reported as double-width, and Darwin 8, where combining
       chars are reported having width 1.

       The solution is to upgrade your system or switch to a better one. A possibly working workaround is to use
       a wcwidth implementation like

           Ps = 4     Pt is a semi-colon separated sequence of one or more semi-colon separated number/name pairs, where number is an index to a colour and name is the name of a colour. Each pair causes the numbered colour to be changed to name.

</pre><h4><b>Mouse</b> <b>Reporting</b></h4><pre>
       When mouse reporting is enabled and none of the extended mouse modes (1005, 1006, 1015) is active,  urxvt
       sends the following sequence on a mouse event:

       <b>"ESC</b> <b>[</b> <b>M</b> <b>&lt;b&gt;</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b> <b>&lt;y&gt;"</b>

       The lower 2 bits of <b>"&lt;b&gt;"</b> indicate the button:

       Button = <b>"(&lt;b&gt;</b> <b>-</b> <b>SPACE)</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>3"</b>
           0   Button1 pressed
           1   Button2 pressed
           2   Button3 pressed
           3   button released (X11 mouse report)

       The  upper  bits  of <b>"&lt;b&gt;"</b> indicate the modifiers when the button was pressed and are added together (X11
       mouse report only):

       State = <b>"(&lt;b&gt;</b> <b>-</b> <b>SPACE)</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>~3"</b>
           4    Shift
           8    Meta
           16   Control
           32   Motion Notify
           32   Double Click (rxvt extension), disabled by default
           64   Button1 is actually Button4, Button2 is actually Button5 etc.

       "x" and "y" encode the coordinates (1|1 is the upper left corner, just as with cursor positioning):

       Col = <b>"&lt;x&gt;</b> <b>-</b> <b>SPACE"</b>
       Row = <b>"&lt;y&gt;</b> <b>-</b> <b>SPACE"</b>

       The parameters include an offset of 32 to ensure that they are printable characters.

       Example: Shift-Button-1 press at top row, column 80.

          ESC [ M $ p !

       The largest coordinate that can be represented in this encoding is 223. The  range  can  be  extended  by
       using one of the extended mouse modes, which should be enabled <u>before</u> enabling mouse reporting, for semi-
       obvious reasons.

   <b>Mode</b> <b>1005</b>
       If mode 1005 is active, urxvt sends the sequence

       <b>"ESC</b> <b>[</b> <b>M</b> <b>&lt;b&gt;</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b> <b>&lt;y&gt;"</b>

       with  the  coordinates provided as characters in locale-encoding instead of 1 byte octets. This mode does
       not work sensibly in non-UTF-8 locales and should therefore be avoided.

   <b>Mode</b> <b>1006</b>
       If mode 1006 is active, urxvt sends the following sequences:

       <b>"ESC</b> <b>[</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>&lt;b&gt;;&lt;x&gt;;&lt;y&gt;</b> <b>M"</b>
           button press and motion

       <b>"ESC</b> <b>[</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>&lt;b&gt;;&lt;x&gt;;&lt;y&gt;</b> <b>m"</b>
           button release

       where the parameters are provided as decimal numbers instead of octets and do not include  an  offset  of
       32.

       The  lower  2  bits  of "b" encode the button number also on button release (instead of the value 3). The
       final character of the sequence (M or m) specifies the event type (press/motion or release).

       Example: Shift-Button-1 press at top row, column 80.

          ESC [ &lt; 4 ; 80 ; 1 M

   <b>Mode</b> <b>1015</b>
       If mode 1015 is active, urxvt sends the sequence

       <b>"ESC</b> <b>[</b> <b>&lt;b&gt;;&lt;x&gt;;&lt;y&gt;</b> <b>M"</b>

       where the parameters are provided as decimal numbers instead of octets and only "b" includes an offset of
       32.

       Example: Shift-Button-1 press at top row, column 80.

          ESC [ 36 ; 80 ; 1 M

</pre><h4><b>Key</b> <b>Codes</b></h4><pre>
       Note: <b>Shift</b> + <b>F1</b>-<b>F10</b> generates <b>F11</b>-<b>F20</b>

       For the keypad, use <b>Shift</b> to temporarily toggle Application Keypad mode  and  use  <b>Num_Lock</b>  to  override
       Application  Keypad  mode, i.e. if <b>Num_Lock</b> is on the keypad is in normal mode. Also note that the values
       of <b>BackSpace</b>, <b>Delete</b> may have been compiled differently on your system.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       General hint: if you get compile errors, then likely your configuration hasn't been tested  well.  Either
       try   with   "--enable-everything"   or   use  the  default  configuration  (i.e.  no  "--enable-xxx"  or
       "--disable-xxx" switches). Of course, you should always report when a combination doesn't work, so it can
       be fixed. Marc Lehmann &lt;<a href="mailto:rxvt@schmorp.de">rxvt@schmorp.de</a>&gt;.

       All

       --enable-everything
           Add (or remove) support for all non-multichoice options listed in "./configure  --help",  except  for
           "--enable-assert" and "--enable-256-color".

           You  can specify this and then disable options you do not like by <u>following</u> this with the appropriate
           "--disable-..."  arguments,  or  you  can  start  with  a   minimal   configuration   by   specifying
           "--disable-everything" and than adding just the "--enable-..." arguments you want.

       --enable-xft (default: on)
           Add  support  for  Xft  (anti-aliased,  among others) fonts. Xft fonts are slower and require lots of
           memory, but as long as you don't use them, you don't pay for them.

       --enable-font-styles (default: on)
           Add support for <b>bold</b>, <u>italic</u> and  <u><b>bold</b></u>  <u><b>italic</b></u>  font  styles.  The  fonts  can  be  set  manually  or
           automatically.

       --with-codesets=CS,... (default: all)
           Compile in support for additional codeset (encoding) groups ("eu", "vn" are always compiled in, which
           includes  most  8-bit character sets). These codeset tables are used for driving X11 core fonts, they
           are not required for Xft fonts, although having them compiled in lets rxvt-unicode choose replacement
           fonts more intelligently. Compiling them in will make your binary bigger (all of them  together  cost
           about  700kB),  but  it  doesn't  increase  memory usage unless you use a font requiring one of these
           encodings.
           all      all available codeset groups
           zh       common chinese encodings
           zh_ext   rarely used but very big chinese encodings
           jp       common japanese encodings
           jp_ext   rarely used but big japanese encodings
           kr       korean encodings

       --enable-xim (default: on)
           Add support for XIM (X Input Method) protocol. This allows  using  alternative  input  methods  (e.g.
           kinput2) and will also correctly set up the input for people using dead keys or compose keys.

       --enable-unicode3 (default: off)
           Recommended to stay off unless you really need a lot of non-BMP characters.

           Enable  support  for  direct storage of unicode characters above 65535 (the basic multilingual page).
           This increases storage requirements per character from 2 to 4 bytes. X11 fonts  do  not  yet  support
           these extra characters, but Xft does.

           Please  note that rxvt-unicode can store and display unicode characters above 65535 even without this
           flag, but the number of such  characters  is  limited  to  a  few  thousand  (shared  with  combining
           characters, see next switch).

       --enable-combining (default: on)
           Enable  automatic composition of combining characters into composite characters. This is required for
           proper viewing of text where accents are encoded as separate unicode  characters.  This  is  done  by
           using  precomposed  characters  when  available or creating new pseudo-characters when no precomposed
           form exists.

           Without --enable-unicode3, the number of additional precomposed characters is somewhat  limited  (the
           6400 private use characters will be (ab-)used). With --enable-unicode3, no practical limit exists.

           This  option  will  also  enable storage (but not display) of characters beyond plane 0 (&gt;65535) when
           --enable-unicode3 was not specified.

           The combining table also contains entries for arabic presentation forms, but these are not  currently
           used. Bug me if you want these to be used (and tell me how these are to be used...).

       --enable-fallback[=CLASS] (default: Rxvt)
           When  reading resource settings, also read settings for class CLASS. To disable resource fallback use
           --disable-fallback.

       --with-res-name=NAME (default: urxvt)
           Use the given name as default application name when reading resources.  Specify  --with-res-name=rxvt
           to replace rxvt.

       --with-res-class=CLASS (default: URxvt)
           Use   the   given   class   as   default   application   class   when   reading   resources.  Specify
           --with-res-class=Rxvt to replace rxvt.

       --enable-pixbuf (default: on)
           Add support for GDK-PixBuf to be used for background images.  It adds support for many  file  formats
           including JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, XPM, BMP, ICO and TGA.

       --enable-startup-notification (default: on)
           Add  support  for freedesktop startup notifications. This allows window managers to display some kind
           of progress indicator during startup.

       --enable-transparency (default: on)
           Add support for using the root pixmap as background to simulate transparency.  Note that this feature
           depends on libXrender and on the availability of the RENDER extension in the X server.

       --enable-fading (default: on)
           Add support for fading the text when focus is lost.

       --enable-rxvt-scroll (default: on)
           Add support for the original rxvt scrollbar.

       --enable-next-scroll (default: on)
           Add support for a NeXT-like scrollbar.

       --enable-xterm-scroll (default: on)
           Add support for an Xterm-like scrollbar.

       --disable-backspace-key
           Removes any handling of the backspace key by us - let the X server do it.

       --disable-delete-key
           Removes any handling of the delete key by us - let the X server do it.

       --disable-resources
           Removes any support for resource checking.

       --disable-swapscreen
           Remove support for secondary/swap screen.

       --enable-frills (default: on)
           Add support for many small features that are not essential but nice to have. Normally you want  this,
           but for very small binaries you may want to disable this.

           A  non-exhaustive  list  of features enabled by "--enable-frills" (possibly in combination with other
           switches) is:

             MWM-hints
             EWMH-hints (pid, utf8 names) and protocols (ping)
             urgency hint
             separate underline colour (-underlineColor)
             settable border widths and borderless switch (-w, -b, -bl)
             visual depth selection (-depth)
             settable extra linespacing (-lsp)
             iso-14755 5.1 (basic) support
             tripleclickwords (-tcw)
             settable insecure mode (-insecure)
             keysym remapping support
             cursor blinking and underline cursor (-bc, -uc)
             XEmbed support (-embed)
             user-pty (-pty-fd)
             hold on exit (-hold)
             compile in built-in block graphics
             skip builtin block graphics (-sbg)
             separate highlight colour (-highlightColor, -highlightTextColor)
             focus reporting mode (1004).
             extended mouse reporting modes (1005, 1006 and 1015).
             visual selection via -visual and -depth.
             systemd socket activation
             selectable rewrapmode
             bracketed paste mode

           It also enables some non-essential features otherwise disabled, such as:

             some round-trip time optimisations
             nearest colour allocation on pseudocolor screens
             UTF8_STRING support for selection
             sgr modes 90..97 and 100..107
             backindex and forwardindex escape sequences
             view change/zero scrollback escape sequences
             locale switching escape sequence
             window op and some xterm/OSC escape sequences
             rectangular selections
             trailing space removal for selections
             verbose X error handling

       --enable-iso14755 (default: on)
           Enable extended ISO 14755 support  (see  <a href="../man1/urxvt.1.html">urxvt</a>(1)).   Basic  support  (section  5.1)  is  enabled  by
           "--enable-frills", while support for 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 is enabled with this switch.

       --enable-keepscrolling (default: on)
           Add support for continual scrolling of the display when you hold the mouse button down on a scrollbar
           arrow.

       --enable-selectionscrolling (default: on)
           Add support for scrolling when the selection moves to the top or bottom of the screen.

       --enable-mousewheel (default: on)
           Add support for scrolling via mouse wheel or buttons 4 &amp; 5.

       --enable-slipwheeling (default: on)
           Add  support  for continual scrolling (using the mouse wheel as an accelerator) while the control key
           is held down.  This option requires --enable-mousewheel to also be specified.

       --enable-smart-resize (default: off)
           Add smart growth/shrink behaviour when resizing.  This should keep the window corner which is closest
           to a corner of the screen in a fixed position.

       --enable-text-blink (default: on)
           Add support for blinking text.

       --enable-pointer-blank (default: on)
           Add support to have the pointer disappear when typing or inactive.

       --enable-perl (default: on)
           Enable an embedded perl interpreter. See the <b><a href="../man3/urxvtperl.3.html">urxvtperl</a>(3)</b> manpage for more info on this  feature,  or
           the  files  in <u>src/perl/</u> for the extensions that are installed by default.  The perl interpreter that
           is used can be specified via the "PERL"  environment  variable  when  running  configure.  Even  when
           compiled  in,  perl  will  <u>not</u>  be  initialised  when  all  extensions  have  been  disabled  "-pe ""
           --perl-ext-common """, so it should be safe to enable from a resource standpoint.

       --enable-assert (default: off)
           Enables the assertions in the code, normally disabled. This switch is  only  useful  when  developing
           rxvt-unicode.

       --enable-256-color (default: off)
           Force  use  of  so-called  256  colour  mode,  to  work around buggy applications that do not support
           termcap/terminfo, or simply improve support for applications hardcoding the xterm 256 colour table.

           This switch breaks termcap/terminfo  compatibility  to  "TERM=rxvt-unicode",  and  consequently  sets
           "TERM"  to  "rxvt-unicode-256color"  by  default  (<u>doc/etc/</u> contains termcap/terminfo definitions for
           both).

           It also results in higher memory usage and can slow down urxvt dramatically when more than six  fonts
           are in use by a terminal instance.

       --with-name=NAME (default: urxvt)
           Set  the  basename  for  the  installed  binaries,  resulting  in  "urxvt",  "urxvtd"  etc.). Specify
           "--with-name=rxvt" to replace with "rxvt".

       --with-term=NAME (default: rxvt-unicode)
           Sets  the  default  "TERM"  value  that  urxvt  sets.  The  default  is  either   "rxvt-unicode"   or
           "rxvt-unicode-256color", as appropriate.

       --with-terminfo=PATH
           If  set, urxvt will set the environment variable "TERMINFO" to the given PATH, which can be useful as
           a last resort if installing the terminfo entries system-wide is not possible.

       --with-x
           Use the X Window System (pretty much default, eh?).
