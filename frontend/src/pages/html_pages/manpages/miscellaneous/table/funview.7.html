       Funview - Database View Support for Tables

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This document contains a summary of the options for utilizing database-inspired Views of tables.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Database</b> <b>Views</b>

       In  database  parlance,  a  <b>View</b>  defines  a  "virtual  table",  i.e., a description of row and/or column
       selection filters (but with no permanent storage space allocated). When used in place of a table, a  View
       selects  the  specified  rows  and/or  columns  from  one  or  more  real tables. Views enable you to see
       complicated data tables in a more convenient format. They also can be used as a  security  mechanism,  by
       restricting user access to specific columns and/or rows.  [See:

       <a href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/~ciaccia/COURSES/RESOURCES/SQLTutorial/sqlch5.htm">http://www.cs.unibo.it/~ciaccia/COURSES/RESOURCES/SQLTutorial/sqlch5.htm</a>

       for a good discussion of SQL Views.]

       Funtools  supports  an expanded notion of Views for all tabular data (FITS tables, raw binary tables, and
       ASCII column files). Funtools Views allow you to pre-set values for the filter specification, the columns
       to activate, and display format (though the latter is for fundisp only).  Setting the filter  and  column
       activation  values  provides  functionality  equivalent  to  that of a classical database View, while the
       ability to set the format is similar to classical report writing capabilities.

       <b>Funtools</b> <b>View</b> <b>Attributes</b>

       A Funtools View is a text file containing one or more of the following columns:

         column         description
         ------         -----------------------------
         view           name of view
         file           data file name or template
         filter         filter specification
         columns        columns to activate
         format         fundisp format specification

       All of the attribute columns are optional, including the <b>view</b> name itself. This means that a View can  be
       named or unnamed. Unnamed Views can refer to a specific file or a template of files (obviously if neither
       the  view  or  the  file  column  is specified, the input View specification will never be used). You can
       specify any combination of filter, column, and format parameters. (It also is  possible  to  apply  file-
       specific  View  to  other files; see the discussion on <b>View</b> <b>Lists</b> below). Each column has a size limit of
       1024 characters.

       For example, consider the following View file:

         view    file                    format  columns       filter
         ----    ----------------------  ------  ------------  -------
         x3      ${HOME}/data/snr.ev     I=%4d   x y pi pha    cir 512 512 .1
         x2      ${HOME}/data/snr.ev             x y pi pha    cir 512 512 .1
         x1      ${HOME}/data/snr.ev                           cir 512 512 .1
         x1a     ${HOME}/data/snr.ev             x y pi pha
         x0      ${HOME}/data/snr.ev
         xf                              I=%4d
         xc                                      x y pi pha
         xr                                                    cir 512 512 .1
                 *.ev                            x y pi pha
                 *.fit                           x y dx dy     cir 400 400  3
                 *.fits                  I=%3d   x y dx dy     cir 400 400  3

       This database example is in rdb format, i.e. using tab delimiters and permitting null values.  Any  valid
       ASCII  table  format  is acceptable, but if you use a format that does not permit null values, it will be
       necessary to quote the null strings.

       The first five entries (x3, x2, x1, x1a, x0) are named entries defining default values  specifically  for
       the snr.ev data file. Typically, you would use these Views by specifying View name, and the corresponding
       file,  filter, column, and format values would be used. Note that the x0 View is essentially an alias for
       the pathname of this file.

       The next three entries define defaults that can be applied to any file.  You typically  would  use  these
       View  names  in  conjunction  with  a  specific  file  name (see <b>View</b> <b>Lists</b> below) so that the associated
       parameter(s) were applied to that file.

       The last three entry in the database define unnamed Views that pertains to  all  files  ending  with  the
       specified templates. In these cases, any View that specifies a file name matching the file template would
       be processed with the associated parameter attributes.

       <b>Invoking</b> <b>a</b> <b>Funtools</b> <b>View</b> <b>(in</b> <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Input</b> <b>File)</b>

       To  use a Funtools View, you simply pre-pend the "v:" prefix to a View name or a file name where an input
       file name usually is specified. For example:

         fundisp v:x3

       specifies that the View named x3 (with its file name and associated parameters) is processed as the input
       file to fundisp. Using the example database, above, this is equivalent to:

         fundisp  -f "I=%4d" ${HOME}/data/snr.ev'[cir 512 512 .1]'  "x y pi pha"

       That is, the format is used with fundisp's -f (format) switch,  while  the  filename  and  extension  are
       composed of the x3 View's filename and region filter.

       Similarly, executing a command such as:

         fundisp v:foo.fit

       will match the unnamed View associated with the template "*.fit".  This is equivalent to executing:

         fundisp foo.fit'[cir 400 400 3]' "x y dx dy"

       Of course, if you omit the "v:" prefix, then no View processing takes place:

         fundisp foo.fit    # process foo.fit without any View parameters
         fundisp x3         # error (assuming there is no file named x3)

       <b>Basic</b> <b>View</b> <b>Matching</b> <b>Rules</b>

       When a "v:" prefix is recognized, Funtools searches for a View database file in the following order:

         location             description
         ------------         ------------------------------------
         FUN_VIEWFILE         environment variable (any file name)
         ./.funtools.vu       hidden file, default name
         $HOME/.funtools.vu   hidden file, default name

       The first View database file located is used to construct a new filename, as well as an activation column
       specification and a format specification. The following rules are used:

       1.  An  attempt  is made to match the input name (i.e., the part of the input View after the "v:" prefix)
       against the <b>view</b> column value (if present) of each row in the database. If a match is found,  the  values
       of  all non-blank columns are saved for later use.  Also note that the first match terminates the search:
       i.e., the order of the database rows matters.

       2. If no <b>view</b> match is made, an attempt is made to match the input name against the <b>file</b> column value (if
       present). Matching is performed on the full pathname of both the input name and the database  file  name,
       and on the non-directory (root) part of these files. This means that the root specification:

         fundisp v:snr.ev

       will match a row in the database that has a full pathname in the file, allowing you to use a <b>file</b>-matched
       View without having to specify the full pathname. In this example, the "v:snr.ev" View specification will
       match the first row (v:x3) in the database:

         x3   ${HOME}/data/snr.ev     I=%4d   x y pi pha    cir 512 512 .1

       even though the row contains a fully qualified pathname as the file value. Once again, values of all non-
       blank columns are saved, and the first match terminates the search.

       3.  If  neither  a <b>view</b> or a <b>view</b> match has been found, then a simple template match is attempted against
       the <b>view</b> values. Template matching supports  a  simplified  version  of  file  globbing  (not  a  regular
       expression),  with  support for a single "*" (all characters), "?" (single character), or "[...]" (range)
       specification.

       4. If no template match was found on the <b>view</b> column, then a simple template match is  attempted  against
       the <b>file</b> columns.

       5. If no match is found, then the filename (minus the "v:" prefix) is returned.

       More on View Matching Rules -  Single vs. Multiple Matches

       The  matching rules described above stop after the first match, regardless of whether that match provides
       values for all three parameters (filter, columns, and format). In cases where a <b>view</b> or <b>file</b>  match  does
       not  provide  all  three  values,  it  is  possible that a template match might do so. With regard to the
       example View database above, the x1 View provides only a filter,  while  omitting  both  the  format  and
       columns  values.  But  note  that  the final rows in the database could provide the values via a template
       match on the filename. This sort of multiple matching is especially valuable in order to provide "global"
       values to several Views.

       Obviously, multiple matching might not be wanted in every  case.  Therefore,  we  support  both  multiple
       matching  and  single  matching according to the value of the FUN_VIEWMATCH environment variable.  If the
       FUN_VIEWMATCH environment variable exists and if its value begins with "s", then a single match  is  used
       and  missing  parameters  are  not  filled in with subsequent template matches on the file name. That is,
       matching rules above are followed exactly as explained above.  If the value of this environment  variable
       begins with "m" (or does not exist), then multiple matches are used to try to fill in missing parameters.
       In  this  case,  template  matching  always  takes place and missing values are taken from these template
       matches.

       Thus, in the example above, the View specification:

         fundisp v:x1

       will take the file name and filter value from the x1 View:

         x1      ${HOME}/data/snr.ev                           cir 512 512 .1

       The column value then will be taken from the "*.ev" file template match against the x1 file name:

                 *.ev                            x y pi pha

       Note once again that order is important: missing values are taken in the  order  in  which  the  template
       matches are processed.

       View Lists -  Applying a View to Any File

       It  is  possible  to  apply a named View, or even several Views, to any data file by appending a <b>viewlist</b>
       immediately after the standard "v:" prefix. A viewlist takes the form:

         :v1,v2,...vn:

       where v1, v2, etc. are named Views. The two ":" colon characters surrounding the list are required. Thus,
       the syntax for applying a viewlist to a file is:

         v::view1,view2,...viewn:filename

       Note that the name after the last ":" is assumed to be a file; it is not permissible (or sensible) to use
       a View name.

       For example, the View specification:

         fundisp v::x2:foo

       applies the x2 View to the file foo (even if there is a  View  named  foo)  and  (in  using  our  example
       database) is equivalent to:

         ./fundisp foo'[cir 512 512 .1] "x y pi pha"

       The same command can be effected using a list of Views:

         fundisp v::x1,x1a:foo

       What happens if a viewlist is used and the file also matches a template? Consider, for example, this View
       specification:

         fundisp v::x2:foo.fit

       Here,  the  x2  View  will  supply  filter  and  column  values, while the template *.fit can also supply
       (different) filter and column values. In this case, the explicitly specified Views of the viewlist  trump
       the matched view values.

       On the other hand, if a file template match can supply a View value that is not supplied by the viewlist,
       then that value will be taken from the file template match. For example:

         fundisp v::x2:foo.fits

       does  not  explicitly  supply  a  format  value, but the file match on *.fits can and does. You can avoid
       supplying missing values using file template matching by replacing the first ":" with a "-" in a viewlist
       specification:

         fundisp v:-x2:foo.fits

       The use of ":+" to explicitly allow file template matching is also supported, but  is  the  same  as  the
       default  case.  Note  that  the  nuances  of viewlist support are subject to change as our experience and
       understanding grow.

       <b>Overriding</b> <b>Values</b> <b>Associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>View</b>

       To override values associated with a View, simply supply the override values in the correct place on  the
       command line. Thus, given the example database described above, the command:

         fundisp v:x3

       specifies that the View named x3, along with its file name and associated parameters, be processed as the
       input file to fundisp in this way:

         fundisp  -f "I=%4d" ${HOME}/data/snr.ev'[cir 512 512 .1]'  "x y pi pha"

       To  override  one or more of these values, simply specify a new value for the format, filter, or columns.
       For example, if your input View file contains a filter, then the View will use that filter as an override
       of the View filter:

         fundisp v:x3'[cir 400 400 3]'

       will use the columns and format of the x3 View but not the x3 filter. Further examples are:

         fundisp v:x3 "x y dx dy"    # activate a different set of columns
         fundisp -f "I=%3d" v:x3     # use a different format statement

       Note that extension names, extension index values, and other non-filter specifications  <b>do</b>  <b>not</b>  override
       the View filter. Thus:

         fundisp v:foo.fit[3]

       will  still  use  the filter associated with the .fit template (see above), since the "3" is an extension
       index, not a filter.

       <b>Environment</b> <b>Variables</b>

       The following environment variables are used by Funtools Views:

       •   <b>FUN_VIEWNAME</b>

           The <b>FUN_VIEWNAME</b> environment variable specifies the name and location of the View database  file.  If
           not present, the files ./.funtools.vu and $HOME/.funtools.vu are searched for, in that order.

       •   <b>FUN_VIEWMATCH</b>

           The  <b>FUN_VIEWMATCH</b>  environment variable specifies whether a single match or multiple match algorithm
           is used to locate parameter values. If the value of this environment variable begins with "s", then a
           single match is used and missing parameters are not filled in with subsequent template matches on the
           file name. If the value begins with "m", then multiple matches are used to try  to  fill  in  missing
           parameters. The default is to use multiple matches.

       <b>Restrictions</b> <b>and</b> <b>Problems</b>

       Support  for overriding a filter (while not overriding extension names, extension indexes, etc.) requires
       that we can sense the presence of a filter in a bracket specification. It  is  unclear  yet  whether  our
       algorithm is perfect.
