       Funfilters - Filtering Rows in a Table

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This document contains a summary of the user interface for filtering rows in binary tables.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Table  filtering  allows a program to select rows from an table (e.g., X-ray event list) by checking each
       row against one or more expressions involving the columns in the table. When a table  is  filtered,  only
       valid rows satisfying these expressions are passed through for processing.

       A  filter  expression  is  specified  using  bracket  notation appended to the filename of the data being
       processed:

         foo.fits[pha==1&amp;&amp;pi==2]

       It is also possible to put region specification inside a file and  then  pass  the  filename  in  bracket
       notation:

         foo.fits[@my.reg]

       Filters  must  be  placed  after  the  extension  and image section information, when such information is
       present. The correct order is:

       •   file[fileinfo,sectioninfo][filters]

       •   file[fileinfo,sectioninfo,filters]

       where:

       •   <b>file</b> is the Funtools file name

       •   <b>fileinfo</b> is an ARRAY, EVENT, FITS extension, or FITS index

       •   <b>sectioninfo</b> is the image section to extract

       •   <b>filters</b> are spatial region and table (row) filters to apply

       See Funtools Files for more information on file and image section specifications.

       <b>Filter</b> <b>Expressions</b>

       Table filtering can be performed on columns of data in a FITS binary table or a raw  event  file.   Table
       filtering  is  accomplished  by  means  of  <b>table</b>  <b>filter</b>  <b>specifications</b>.  An table filter specification
       consists of one  or  more  <b>filter</b>  <b>expressions</b>  Filter  specifications  also  can  contain  comments  and
       local/global processing directives.

       More specifically, a filter specification consist of one or more lines containing:

         # comment until end of line
         # include the following file in the table descriptor
         @file
         # each row expression can contain filters separated by operators
         [filter_expression] BOOLOP [filter_expression2], ...
         # each row expression can contain filters separated by the comma operator
         [filter_expression1], [filter_expression2], ...
         # the special row# keyword allows a range of rows to be processed
         row#=m:n
         # or a single row
         row#=m
         # regions are supported -- but are described elsewhere
         [spatial_region_expression]

       A  single filter expression consists of an arithmetic, logical, or other operations involving one or more
       column values from a table. Columns can be compared to other columns, to header  values,  or  to  numeric
       constants. Standard math functions can be applied to columns. Separate filter expressions can be combined
       using  boolean operators.  Standard C semantics can be used when constructing expressions, with the usual
       precedence and associativity rules holding sway:

         Operator                                Associativity
         --------                                -------------
         ()                                      left to right
         !! (logical not)                        right to left
         !  (bitwise not) - (unary minus)        right to left
         *  /                                    left to right
         +  -                                    left to right
         &lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;=                               left to right
         == !=                                   left to right
         &amp;  (bitwise and)                        left to right
         ^  (bitwise exclusive or)               left to right
         ⎪  (bitwise inclusive or)               left to right
         &amp;&amp; (logical and)                        left to right
         ⎪⎪ (logical or)                         left to right
         =                                       right to left

       For example, if energy and pha are columns in a table, then the following are valid expressions:

         pha&gt;1
         energy == pha
         (pha&gt;1) &amp;&amp; (energy&lt;=2)
         max(pha,energy)&gt;=2.5

       Comparison values can be integers or floats. Integer comparison values can be specified in decimal, octal
       (using '0' as prefix), hex (using '0x' as prefix) or binary (using '0b' as prefix). Thus,  the  following
       all specify the same comparison test of a status mask:

         (status &amp; 15) == 8           # decimal
         (status &amp; 017) == 010        # octal
         (status &amp; 0xf) == 0x8        # hex
         (status &amp; 0b1111) == 0b1000  # binary

       The  special keyword row# allows you to process a range of rows.  When row# is specified, the filter code
       skips to the designated row  and only processes the specified number of rows. The "*"  character  can  be
       utilized as the high limit value to denote processing of the remaining rows. Thus:

         row#=100:109

       processes 10 rows, starting with row 100 (counting from 1), while:

         row#=100:*

       specifies that all but the first 99 rows are to be processed.

       Spatial  region  filtering allows a program to select regions of an image or rows of a table (e.g., X-ray
       events) using simple geometric shapes and boolean combinations of shapes.  For a complete description  of
       regions, see Spatial Region Filtering.

       <b>Separators</b> <b>Also</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Operators</b>

       As  mentioned  previously, multiple filter expressions can be specified in a filter descriptor, separated
       by commas or new-lines.  When such a comma or new-line separator is used, the  boolean  AND  operator  is
       automatically generated in its place. Thus and expression such as:

         pha==1,pi=2:4

       is equivalent to:

         (pha==1) &amp;&amp; (pi&gt;=2&amp;&amp;pi&lt;=4)

       [Note that the behavior of separators is different for filter expressions and spatial region expressions.
       The former uses AND as the operator, while the latter user OR. See Combining Region and Table Filters for
       more information about these conventions and how they are treated when combined.]

       <b>Range</b> <b>Lists</b>

       Aside from the standard C syntax, filter expressions can make use of IRAF-style <b>range</b> <b>lists</b> which specify
       a range of values. The syntax requires that the column name be followed by an '=' sign, which is followed
       by one or more comma-delimited range expressions of the form:

         col = vv              # col == vv in range
         col = :vv             # col &lt;= vv in range
         col = vv:             # col &gt;= vv in range
         col = vv1:vv2         # vv1 &lt;= col &lt;= vv2 in range

       The  vv's  above  must  be numeric constants; the right hand side of a range list cannot contain a column
       name or header value.

       Note that, unlike an ordinary comma separator, the  comma  separator  used  between  two  or  more  range
       expressions  denotes  OR.   Thus, when two or more range expressions are combined with a comma separator,
       the resulting expression is a shortcut for more complicated boolean logic. For example:

         col = :3,6:8,10:

       is equivalent to:

         (col=6 &amp;&amp; col =10)

       Note also that the single-valued rangelist:

         col = val

       is equivalent to the C-based filter expression:

         col == val

       assuming, of course, that val is a numeric constant.

       <b>Math</b> <b>Operations</b> <b>and</b> <b>Functions</b>

       It is permissible to specify C math functions as part of the  filter  syntax.   When  the  filter  parser
       recognizes  a function call, it automatically includes the math.h and links in the C math library.  Thus,
       it is possible to filter rows by expressions such as these:

       •   (pi+pha)&gt;(2+log(pi)-pha)

       •   min(pi,pha)*14&gt;x

       •   max(pi,pha)==(pi+1)

       •   feq(pi,pha)

       •   div(pi,pha)&gt;0

       The function feq(a,b) returns true (1) if the difference between a  and  b  (taken  as  double  precision
       values)  is less than approximately 10E-15.  The function div(a,b) divides a by b, but returns NaN (not a
       number) if b is 0. It is a safe way to avoid floating point errors when dividing one column by another.

       <b>Include</b> <b>Files</b>

       The special <b>@filename</b> directive specifies an include file containing filter  expressions.  This  file  is
       processed as part of the overall filter descriptor:

         foo.fits[pha==1,@foo]

       <b>Header</b> <b>Parameters</b>

       The  filter  syntax  supports  comparison  between  a column value and a header parameter value of a FITS
       binary tables (raw event files have no such header).  The header parameters can be taken from the  binary
       table  header  or  the  primary header.  For example, assuming there is a header value MEAN_PHA in one of
       these headers, you can select photons having exactly this value using:

       •   pha==MEAN_PHA

       Table filtering is more easily described by means of examples.  Consider data  containing  the  following
       table structure:

       •   double TIME

       •   int X

       •   int Y

       •   short PI

       •   short PHA

       •   int DX

       •   int DY

       Tables  can  be  filtered  on  these  columns  using  IRAF/QPOE  range syntax or any valid C syntax.  The
       following examples illustrate the possibilities:

       •   pha=10

       •   pha==10

           select rows whose pha value is exactly 10

       •   pha=10:50

           select rows whose pha value is in the range of 10 to 50

       •   pha=10:50,100

           select rows whose pha value is in the range of 10 to 50 or is equal to 100

       •   pha&gt;=10 &amp;&amp; pha&lt;=50

           select rows whose pha value is in the range of 10 to 50

       •   pi=1,2&amp;&amp;pha&gt;3

           select rows whose pha value is 1 or 2 and whose pi value is 3

       •   pi=1,2 ⎪⎪ pha&gt;3

           select rows whose pha value is 1 or 2 or whose pi value is 3

       •   pha==pi+1

           select rows whose pha value is 1 less than the pi value

       •   (pha==pi+1) &amp;&amp; (time&gt;50000.0)

           select rows whose pha value is 1 less than the pi value and whose time value is greater than 50000

       •   (pi+pha)&gt;20

           select rows in which the sum of the pi and pha values is greater than 20

       •   pi%2==1

           select rows in which the pi value is odd

       Currently, integer range list limits cannot be specified in binary notation (use decimal, hex,  or  octal
       instead). Please contact us if this is a problem.
