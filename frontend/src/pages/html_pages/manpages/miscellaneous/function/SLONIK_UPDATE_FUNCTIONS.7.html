       UPDATE FUNCTIONS - Reload stored functions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>UPDATE</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b> <b>(options);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Reloads stored functions for a node.

       Reloads  all stored procedure and function definitions in the Slony-I schema for the specified node. This
       command is usually part of the Slony-I software upgrade procedure.

       ID = ival
              The node to refresh.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       UPDATE FUNCTIONS (
           ID = 3        # Update functions on node 3
       );

</pre><h4><b>LOCKING</b> <b>BEHAVIOUR</b></h4><pre>
       No application-visible locking should take place.

</pre><h4><b>SLONIK</b> <b>EVENT</b> <b>CONFIRMATION</b> <b>BEHAVIOUR</b></h4><pre>
       Slonik does not wait for event confirmations before performing this command.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       This command was introduced in Slony-I 1.0

</pre><h4><b>ODDITIES</b></h4><pre>
       Any mismatch between <b><a href="../man1/slonik.1.html">slonik</a></b>(1) and the C libraries ‘living’ in the PostgreSQL installation will result in
       this failing to do what is expected, and, more than likely, failing to run at all. You may <u>think</u> you  are
       upgrading to version 1.1.5, but if you are running <b><a href="../man1/slonik.1.html">slonik</a></b>(1) from version 1.1.2, or if you didn't restart
       the database with a version that has 1.1.5 libraries, and instead are referencing C stored functions from
       version  1.1.1,  the attempt to upgrade will fail, because the sets of C functions have regularly changed
       between major versions.

       Before Slony-I 1.2, the error messages that would result would be not terribly  informative;  what  you'd
       find, in PostgreSQL logs, is some error message about being unable to load some stored function that hap‐
       pens to be implemented in C. As of 1.2, one of the first things done is to load a stored function to ver‐
       ify version numbers; it complains in a much more direct fashion if you have some versioning mismatch.

                                                19 September 2024                     <u>SLONIK</u> <u>UPDATE</u> <u><a href="../man7/FUNCTIONS.7.html">FUNCTIONS</a></u>(7)
