</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>CREATE</b> <b>FUNCTION</b> defines a new function.  <b>CREATE</b> <b>OR</b> <b>REPLACE</b> <b>FUNCTION</b> will either create a new function, or
       replace an existing definition. To be able to define a function, the user must have the USAGE privilege
       on the language.

       If a schema name is included, then the function is created in the specified schema. Otherwise it is
       created in the current schema. The name of the new function must not match any existing function or
       procedure with the same input argument types in the same schema. However, functions and procedures of
       different argument types can share a name (this is called overloading).

       To replace the current definition of an existing function, use <b>CREATE</b> <b>OR</b> <b>REPLACE</b> <b>FUNCTION</b>. It is not
       possible to change the name or argument types of a function this way (if you tried, you would actually be
       creating a new, distinct function). Also, <b>CREATE</b> <b>OR</b> <b>REPLACE</b> <b>FUNCTION</b> will not let you change the return
       type of an existing function. To do that, you must drop and recreate the function. (When using OUT
       parameters, that means you cannot change the types of any OUT parameters except by dropping the
       function.)

       When <b>CREATE</b> <b>OR</b> <b>REPLACE</b> <b>FUNCTION</b> is used to replace an existing function, the ownership and permissions of
       the function do not change. All other function properties are assigned the values specified or implied in
       the command. You must own the function to replace it (this includes being a member of the owning role).

       If you drop and then recreate a function, the new function is not the same entity as the old; you will
       have to drop existing rules, views, triggers, etc. that refer to the old function. Use <b>CREATE</b> <b>OR</b> <b>REPLACE</b>
       <b>FUNCTION</b> to change a function definition without breaking objects that refer to the function. Also, <b>ALTER</b>
       <b>FUNCTION</b> can be used to change most of the auxiliary properties of an existing function.

       The user that creates the function becomes the owner of the function.

       To be able to create a function, you must have USAGE privilege on the argument types and the return type.

       Refer to Section 36.3 for further information on writing functions.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>name</u>
           The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the function to create.

       <u>argmode</u>
           The mode of an argument: IN, OUT, INOUT, or VARIADIC. If omitted, the default is IN. Only OUT
           arguments can follow a VARIADIC one. Also, OUT and INOUT arguments cannot be used together with the
           RETURNS TABLE notation.

       <u>argname</u>
           The name of an argument. Some languages (including SQL and PL/pgSQL) let you use the name in the
           function body. For other languages the name of an input argument is just extra documentation, so far
           as the function itself is concerned; but you can use input argument names when calling a function to
           improve readability (see Section 4.3). In any case, the name of an output argument is significant,
           because it defines the column name in the result row type. (If you omit the name for an output
           argument, the system will choose a default column name.)

       <u>argtype</u>
           The data type(s) of the function's arguments (optionally schema-qualified), if any. The argument
           types can be base, composite, or domain types, or can reference the type of a table column.

           Depending on the implementation language it might also be allowed to specify “pseudo-types” such as
           cstring. Pseudo-types indicate that the actual argument type is either incompletely specified, or
           outside the set of ordinary SQL data types.

           The type of a column is referenced by writing <u>table_name</u>.<u>column_name</u>%TYPE. Using this feature can
           sometimes help make a function independent of changes to the definition of a table.

       <u>default_expr</u>
           An expression to be used as default value if the parameter is not specified. The expression has to be
           coercible to the argument type of the parameter. Only input (including INOUT) parameters can have a
           default value. All input parameters following a parameter with a default value must have default
           values as well.

       <u>rettype</u>
           The return data type (optionally schema-qualified). The return type can be a base, composite, or
           domain type, or can reference the type of a table column. Depending on the implementation language it
           might also be allowed to specify “pseudo-types” such as cstring. If the function is not supposed to
           return a value, specify void as the return type.

           When there are OUT or INOUT parameters, the RETURNS clause can be omitted. If present, it must agree
           with the result type implied by the output parameters: RECORD if there are multiple output
           parameters, or the same type as the single output parameter.

           The SETOF modifier indicates that the function will return a set of items, rather than a single item.

           The type of a column is referenced by writing <u>table_name</u>.<u>column_name</u>%TYPE.

       <u>column_name</u>
           The name of an output column in the RETURNS TABLE syntax. This is effectively another way of
           declaring a named OUT parameter, except that RETURNS TABLE also implies RETURNS SETOF.

       <u>column_type</u>
           The data type of an output column in the RETURNS TABLE syntax.

       <u>lang_name</u>
           The name of the language that the function is implemented in. It can be sql, c, internal, or the name
           of a user-defined procedural language, e.g., plpgsql. The default is sql if <u>sql_body</u> is specified.
           Enclosing the name in single quotes is deprecated and requires matching case.

       TRANSFORM { FOR TYPE <u>type_name</u> } [, ... ] }
           Lists which transforms a call to the function should apply. Transforms convert between SQL types and
           language-specific data types; see CREATE TRANSFORM (<b><a href="../man7/CREATE_TRANSFORM.7.html">CREATE_TRANSFORM</a></b>(7)). Procedural language
           implementations usually have hardcoded knowledge of the built-in types, so those don't need to be
           listed here. If a procedural language implementation does not know how to handle a type and no
           transform is supplied, it will fall back to a default behavior for converting data types, but this
           depends on the implementation.

       WINDOW
           WINDOW indicates that the function is a window function rather than a plain function. This is
           currently only useful for functions written in C. The WINDOW attribute cannot be changed when
           replacing an existing function definition.

       IMMUTABLE
       STABLE
       VOLATILE
           These attributes inform the query optimizer about the behavior of the function. At most one choice
           can be specified. If none of these appear, VOLATILE is the default assumption.

           IMMUTABLE indicates that the function cannot modify the database and always returns the same result
           when given the same argument values; that is, it does not do database lookups or otherwise use
           information not directly present in its argument list. If this option is given, any call of the
           function with all-constant arguments can be immediately replaced with the function value.

           STABLE indicates that the function cannot modify the database, and that within a single table scan it
           will consistently return the same result for the same argument values, but that its result could
           change across SQL statements. This is the appropriate selection for functions whose results depend on
           database lookups, parameter variables (such as the current time zone), etc. (It is inappropriate for
           AFTER triggers that wish to query rows modified by the current command.) Also note that the
           <b>current_timestamp</b> family of functions qualify as stable, since their values do not change within a
           transaction.

           VOLATILE indicates that the function value can change even within a single table scan, so no
           optimizations can be made. Relatively few database functions are volatile in this sense; some
           examples are random(), currval(), timeofday(). But note that any function that has side-effects must
           be classified volatile, even if its result is quite predictable, to prevent calls from being
           optimized away; an example is setval().

           For additional details see Section 36.7.

       LEAKPROOF
           LEAKPROOF indicates that the function has no side effects. It reveals no information about its
           arguments other than by its return value. For example, a function which throws an error message for
           some argument values but not others, or which includes the argument values in any error message, is
           not leakproof. This affects how the system executes queries against views created with the
           security_barrier option or tables with row level security enabled. The system will enforce conditions
           from security policies and security barrier views before any user-supplied conditions from the query
           itself that contain non-leakproof functions, in order to prevent the inadvertent exposure of data.
           Functions and operators marked as leakproof are assumed to be trustworthy, and may be executed before
           conditions from security policies and security barrier views. In addition, functions which do not
           take arguments or which are not passed any arguments from the security barrier view or table do not
           have to be marked as leakproof to be executed before security conditions. See CREATE VIEW
           (<b><a href="../man7/CREATE_VIEW.7.html">CREATE_VIEW</a></b>(7)) and Section 39.5. This option can only be set by the superuser.

       CALLED ON NULL INPUT
       RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT
       STRICT
           CALLED ON NULL INPUT (the default) indicates that the function will be called normally when some of
           its arguments are null. It is then the function author's responsibility to check for null values if
           necessary and respond appropriately.

           RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT or STRICT indicates that the function always returns null whenever any of
           its arguments are null. If this parameter is specified, the function is not executed when there are
           null arguments; instead a null result is assumed automatically.

       [EXTERNAL] SECURITY INVOKER
       [EXTERNAL] SECURITY DEFINER
           SECURITY INVOKER indicates that the function is to be executed with the privileges of the user that
           calls it. That is the default.  SECURITY DEFINER specifies that the function is to be executed with
           the privileges of the user that owns it. For information on how to write SECURITY DEFINER functions
           safely, see below.

           The key word EXTERNAL is allowed for SQL conformance, but it is optional since, unlike in SQL, this
           feature applies to all functions not only external ones.

       PARALLEL
           PARALLEL UNSAFE indicates that the function can't be executed in parallel mode; the presence of such
           a function in an SQL statement forces a serial execution plan. This is the default.  PARALLEL
           RESTRICTED indicates that the function can be executed in parallel mode, but only in the parallel
           group leader process.  PARALLEL SAFE indicates that the function is safe to run in parallel mode
           without restriction, including in parallel worker processes.

           Functions should be labeled parallel unsafe if they modify any database state, change the transaction
           state (other than by using a subtransaction for error recovery), access sequences (e.g., by calling
           currval) or make persistent changes to settings. They should be labeled parallel restricted if they
           access temporary tables, client connection state, cursors, prepared statements, or miscellaneous
           backend-local state which the system cannot synchronize in parallel mode (e.g., setseed cannot be
           executed other than by the group leader because a change made by another process would not be
           reflected in the leader). In general, if a function is labeled as being safe when it is restricted or
           unsafe, or if it is labeled as being restricted when it is in fact unsafe, it may throw errors or
           produce wrong answers when used in a parallel query. C-language functions could in theory exhibit
           totally undefined behavior if mislabeled, since there is no way for the system to protect itself
           against arbitrary C code, but in most likely cases the result will be no worse than for any other
           function. If in doubt, functions should be labeled as UNSAFE, which is the default.

       COST <u>execution_cost</u>
           A positive number giving the estimated execution cost for the function, in units of
           cpu_operator_cost. If the function returns a set, this is the cost per returned row. If the cost is
           not specified, 1 unit is assumed for C-language and internal functions, and 100 units for functions
           in all other languages. Larger values cause the planner to try to avoid evaluating the function more
           often than necessary.

       ROWS <u>result_rows</u>
           A positive number giving the estimated number of rows that the planner should expect the function to
           return. This is only allowed when the function is declared to return a set. The default assumption is
           1000 rows.

       SUPPORT <u>support_function</u>
           The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a planner support function to use for this function. See
           Section 36.11 for details. You must be superuser to use this option.

       <u>configuration_parameter</u>
       <u>value</u>
           The SET clause causes the specified configuration parameter to be set to the specified value when the
           function is entered, and then restored to its prior value when the function exits.  SET FROM CURRENT
           saves the value of the parameter that is current when <b>CREATE</b> <b>FUNCTION</b> is executed as the value to be
           applied when the function is entered.

           If a SET clause is attached to a function, then the effects of a <b>SET</b> <b>LOCAL</b> command executed inside
           the function for the same variable are restricted to the function: the configuration parameter's
           prior value is still restored at function exit. However, an ordinary <b>SET</b> command (without LOCAL)
           overrides the SET clause, much as it would do for a previous <b>SET</b> <b>LOCAL</b> command: the effects of such a
           command will persist after function exit, unless the current transaction is rolled back.

           See <b><a href="../man7/SET.7.html">SET</a></b>(7) and Chapter 19 for more information about allowed parameter names and values.

       <u>definition</u>
           A string constant defining the function; the meaning depends on the language. It can be an internal
           function name, the path to an object file, an SQL command, or text in a procedural language.

           It is often helpful to use dollar quoting (see Section 4.1.2.4) to write the function definition
           string, rather than the normal single quote syntax. Without dollar quoting, any single quotes or
           backslashes in the function definition must be escaped by doubling them.

       <u>obj_file</u>, <u>link_symbol</u>
           This form of the AS clause is used for dynamically loadable C language functions when the function
           name in the C language source code is not the same as the name of the SQL function. The string
           <u>obj_file</u> is the name of the shared library file containing the compiled C function, and is
           interpreted as for the <b>LOAD</b> command. The string <u>link_symbol</u> is the function's link symbol, that is,
           the name of the function in the C language source code. If the link symbol is omitted, it is assumed
           to be the same as the name of the SQL function being defined. The C names of all functions must be
           different, so you must give overloaded C functions different C names (for example, use the argument
           types as part of the C names).

           When repeated <b>CREATE</b> <b>FUNCTION</b> calls refer to the same object file, the file is only loaded once per
           session. To unload and reload the file (perhaps during development), start a new session.

       <u>sql_body</u>
           The body of a LANGUAGE SQL function. This can either be a single statement

               RETURN <u>expression</u>

           or a block

               BEGIN ATOMIC
                 <u>statement</u>;
                 <u>statement</u>;
                 ...
                 <u>statement</u>;
               END

           This is similar to writing the text of the function body as a string constant (see <u>definition</u> above),
           but there are some differences: This form only works for LANGUAGE SQL, the string constant form works
           for all languages. This form is parsed at function definition time, the string constant form is
           parsed at execution time; therefore this form cannot support polymorphic argument types and other
           constructs that are not resolvable at function definition time. This form tracks dependencies between
           the function and objects used in the function body, so DROP ... CASCADE will work correctly, whereas
           the form using string literals may leave dangling functions. Finally, this form is more compatible
           with the SQL standard and other SQL implementations.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLOADING</b></h4><pre>
       PostgreSQL allows function overloading; that is, the same name can be used for several different
       functions so long as they have distinct input argument types. Whether or not you use it, this capability
       entails security precautions when calling functions in databases where some users mistrust other users;
       see Section 10.3.

       Two functions are considered the same if they have the same names and <u>input</u> argument types, ignoring any
       OUT parameters. Thus for example these declarations conflict:

           CREATE FUNCTION foo(int) ...
           CREATE FUNCTION foo(int, out text) ...

       Functions that have different argument type lists will not be considered to conflict at creation time,
       but if defaults are provided they might conflict in use. For example, consider

           CREATE FUNCTION foo(int) ...
           CREATE FUNCTION foo(int, int default 42) ...

       A call <a href="../man10/foo.10.html">foo</a>(10) will fail due to the ambiguity about which function should be called.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The full SQL type syntax is allowed for declaring a function's arguments and return value. However,
       parenthesized type modifiers (e.g., the precision field for type numeric) are discarded by <b>CREATE</b>
       <b>FUNCTION</b>. Thus for example CREATE FUNCTION foo (<a href="../man10/varchar.10.html">varchar</a>(10)) ...  is exactly the same as CREATE FUNCTION
       foo (varchar) ....

       When replacing an existing function with <b>CREATE</b> <b>OR</b> <b>REPLACE</b> <b>FUNCTION</b>, there are restrictions on changing
       parameter names. You cannot change the name already assigned to any input parameter (although you can add
       names to parameters that had none before). If there is more than one output parameter, you cannot change
       the names of the output parameters, because that would change the column names of the anonymous composite
       type that describes the function's result. These restrictions are made to ensure that existing calls of
       the function do not stop working when it is replaced.

       If a function is declared STRICT with a VARIADIC argument, the strictness check tests that the variadic
       array <u>as</u> <u>a</u> <u>whole</u> is non-null. The function will still be called if the array has null elements.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Add two integers using an SQL function:

           CREATE FUNCTION add(integer, integer) RETURNS integer
               AS 'select $1 + $2;'
               LANGUAGE SQL
               IMMUTABLE
               RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT;

       The same function written in a more SQL-conforming style, using argument names and an unquoted body:

           CREATE FUNCTION add(a integer, b integer) RETURNS integer
               LANGUAGE SQL
               IMMUTABLE
               RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT
               RETURN a + b;

       Increment an integer, making use of an argument name, in PL/pgSQL:

           CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment(i integer) RETURNS integer AS $$
                   BEGIN
                           RETURN i + 1;
                   END;
           $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

       Return a record containing multiple output parameters:

           CREATE FUNCTION dup(in int, out f1 int, out f2 text)
               AS $$ SELECT $1, CAST($1 AS text) || ' is text' $$
               LANGUAGE SQL;

           SELECT * FROM <a href="../man42/dup.42.html">dup</a>(42);

       You can do the same thing more verbosely with an explicitly named composite type:

           CREATE TYPE dup_result AS (f1 int, f2 text);

           CREATE FUNCTION dup(int) RETURNS dup_result
               AS $$ SELECT $1, CAST($1 AS text) || ' is text' $$
               LANGUAGE SQL;

           SELECT * FROM <a href="../man42/dup.42.html">dup</a>(42);

       Another way to return multiple columns is to use a TABLE function:

           CREATE FUNCTION dup(int) RETURNS TABLE(f1 int, f2 text)
               AS $$ SELECT $1, CAST($1 AS text) || ' is text' $$
               LANGUAGE SQL;

           SELECT * FROM <a href="../man42/dup.42.html">dup</a>(42);

       However, a TABLE function is different from the preceding examples, because it actually returns a <u>set</u> of
       records, not just one record.

</pre><h4><b>WRITING</b> <b>SECURITY</b> <b>DEFINER</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b> <b>SAFELY</b></h4><pre>
       Because a SECURITY DEFINER function is executed with the privileges of the user that owns it, care is
       needed to ensure that the function cannot be misused. For security, search_path should be set to exclude
       any schemas writable by untrusted users. This prevents malicious users from creating objects (e.g.,
       tables, functions, and operators) that mask objects intended to be used by the function. Particularly
       important in this regard is the temporary-table schema, which is searched first by default, and is
       normally writable by anyone. A secure arrangement can be obtained by forcing the temporary schema to be
       searched last. To do this, write pg_temp as the last entry in <u>search_path</u>. This function illustrates safe
       usage:

           CREATE FUNCTION check_password(uname TEXT, pass TEXT)
           RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
           DECLARE passed BOOLEAN;
           BEGIN
                   SELECT  (pwd = $2) INTO passed
                   FROM    pwds
                   WHERE   username = $1;

                   RETURN passed;
           END;
           $$  LANGUAGE plpgsql
               SECURITY DEFINER
               -- Set a secure search_path: trusted schema(s), then 'pg_temp'.
               SET search_path = admin, pg_temp;

       This function's intention is to access a table admin.pwds. But without the SET clause, or with a SET
       clause mentioning only admin, the function could be subverted by creating a temporary table named pwds.

       If the security definer function intends to create roles, and if it is running as a non-superuser,
       <u>createrole_self_grant</u> should also be set to a known value using the SET clause.

       Another point to keep in mind is that by default, execute privilege is granted to PUBLIC for newly
       created functions (see Section 5.8 for more information). Frequently you will wish to restrict use of a
       security definer function to only some users. To do that, you must revoke the default PUBLIC privileges
       and then grant execute privilege selectively. To avoid having a window where the new function is
       accessible to all, create it and set the privileges within a single transaction. For example:

           BEGIN;
           CREATE FUNCTION check_password(uname TEXT, pass TEXT) ... SECURITY DEFINER;
           REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION check_password(uname TEXT, pass TEXT) FROM PUBLIC;
           GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION check_password(uname TEXT, pass TEXT) TO admins;
           COMMIT;

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       A <b>CREATE</b> <b>FUNCTION</b> command is defined in the SQL standard. The PostgreSQL implementation can be used in a
       compatible way but has many extensions. Conversely, the SQL standard specifies a number of optional
       features that are not implemented in PostgreSQL.

       The following are important compatibility issues:

       •   OR REPLACE is a PostgreSQL extension.

       •   For compatibility with some other database systems, <u>argmode</u> can be written either before or after
           <u>argname</u>. But only the first way is standard-compliant.

       •   For parameter defaults, the SQL standard specifies only the syntax with the DEFAULT key word. The
           syntax with = is used in T-SQL and Firebird.

       •   The SETOF modifier is a PostgreSQL extension.

       •   Only SQL is standardized as a language.

       •   All other attributes except CALLED ON NULL INPUT and RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT are not standardized.

       •   For the body of LANGUAGE SQL functions, the SQL standard only specifies the <u>sql_body</u> form.

       Simple LANGUAGE SQL functions can be written in a way that is both standard-conforming and portable to
       other implementations. More complex functions using advanced features, optimization attributes, or other
       languages will necessarily be specific to PostgreSQL in a significant way.
