       <b>XPAEnv</b> <b>-</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Variables</b> <b>for</b> <b>XPA</b> <b>Messaging</b>

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Describes the environment variables which can be used to tailor the overall XPA environment.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables are supported by XPA:

       •   <b>XPA_ACL</b>

           If  <u>XPA_ACL</u>  is <u>true</u>, then host-based XPA Access Control is turned on and only specified machines can
           access specified access points.  If <u>false</u>, then access control is turned  off  and  any  machine  can
           access point. The default is turn turn access control on.

       •   <b>XPA_ACLFILE</b>

           If  XPA  Access  Control is turned on, this variable specifies the name of the file containing access
           control information for all  access  points  started  by  this  user.   The  default  file  name  is:
           <u>$HOME/acls.xpa</u>.

       •   <b>XPA_CONNECT_TIMEOUT</b>

           When  an  XPA  server first starts up, it immediately tries to connect to the XPA name server program
           (xpans) on the host specified by the <u>XPA_NSINET</u> variable. (If this  connection  fails  on  the  local
           host,  and  if  xpans  can  be  found  in  the  path, then the name server is started automatically.)
           Unfortunately, a mis-configured network can cause this connect attempt to hang for many seconds while
           the <u>connect()</u> system call times out. Therefore, an alarm is started to interrupt the  <u>connect()</u>  call
           and prevent a long hang.  The initial value of the alarm timeout is 10 seconds, but can be changed by
           setting  this  environment variable. If you want to disable the alarm and allow the initial <u>connect()</u>
           to time out, set the value of this variable to 0. Normally, users would not change this  variable  at
           all.

       •   <b>XPA_CLIENT_DOXPA</b>

           Normally,  an  XPA  client  (xpaget,  xpaset,  etc.)  will process incoming XPA server requests while
           awaiting the completion of the client request.  Setting this variable to  "false"  will  prevent  XPA
           server requests from being processed by the client.

       •   <b>XPA_DEFACL</b>

           If  XPA Access Control is turned on, this variable specifies the default access control condition for
           all access points, if the <u>XPA_ACLFILE</u> file does not exist.  The default  acl  is:  <u>$host:*</u>  <u>$host</u>  <u>+</u>,
           meaning that all processes on the host machine have full access to all access points.

       •   <b>XPA_HOST</b>

           For  the  INET  socket  method, XPA utilizes the canonical hostname (as returned by the <u>gethostname()</u>
           routine) to construct the IP part of the method id. Under some circumstances, this  might  not  be  a
           correct choice of name and IP. For example, if an XPA server is started on a machine running VPN, you
           might  want  to use the VPN name and IP instead of the canonical host name, so that other machines in
           the VPN network can access the server. In this case, you can set the XPA_HOST to be the VPN name  (if
           resolvable) or, more easily, the VPN IP.

       •   <b>XPA_IOCALLSXPA</b>

           Setting this variable causes all XPA socket IO calls to process outstanding XPA requests whenever the
           primary  socket is not ready for IO. This means that a server making a client call will (recursively)
           process incoming server requests while waiting for client completion.  This inter-IO  XPA  processing
           avoids  a  rare  XPA Race Condition: two or more XPA servers sending messages to one another using an
           XPA client routine such as <u>XPASet()</u> can deadlock while each waits for the other  server  to  respond.
           This  can  happen, for example, if the servers call <u>XPAPoll()</u> with a time limit, and send messages in
           between the polling call.

           By default, this option is turned off, because we judge that the added code complication and overhead
           involved will not be justified by the amount of its use.  Moreover, processing  XPA  requests  within
           socket  IO  can lead to non-intuitive results, since incoming server requests will not necessarily be
           processed to completion in the order in which they are received.

       •   <b>XPA_LOGNAME</b>

           XPA preferentially uses the de facto standard environment variable LOGNAME to determine the  username
           when  registering  an access point in the name server. If this environment variable has been used for
           something other than the actual user name (such as a log file name), unexpected results can ensue. In
           such  cases,  use  the  XPA_LOGNAME  variable  to  set  the  user  name.  (If  neither  exists,  then
           getpwuid(<u>geteuid()</u>) is used as a last resort).

       •   <b>XPA_LONG_TIMEOUT</b>

           XPA  is  designed  to  allow  data  to be sent from one process to another over a long period of time
           (i.e., a program that generates image data sends that data to an image display, but  slowly)  but  it
           also  seeks  to  prevent  hangs.  This  is  done by supporting 2 timeout periods: a <u>short</u> timeout for
           protocol communication and a <u>long</u> for data communication.

           The <u>XPA_LONG_TIMEOUT</u> variable controls the <u>long</u> timeout and is used to prevent hangs in  cases  where
           communication  between  the  client  and  server  that is <u>not</u> controlled by the XPA interface itself.
           Transfer of data between client and server, or a client's wait for a status message after  completion
           of  the server callback, are two examples of this sort of communication. By default, the <u>long</u> timeout
           is set to 180 seconds.  Setting the value to -1 will disable <u>long</u>  timeouts  and  allow  an  infinite
           amount of time.

       •   <b>XPA_MAXHOSTS</b>

           The  maximum  number  of access points that the programs <u>xpaset</u>, <u>xpaget</u>, and <u>xpainfo</u> will communicate
           with at one time. The default is 64, meaning, for example, that the <u>xpaset</u> program will  not  send  a
           message  to  more  than 100 access points at one time and <u>xpaget</u> will not retrieve from more than 100
           access points at one time.

       •   <b>XPA_METHOD</b>

           Determines the socket connection method used by this session of XPA.  The choices are: <u>inet</u>  (to  use
           INET  or  Internet-based  sockets),  <u>localhost</u>  (to use the machines localhost inet socket), or <u>local</u>
           <u>(unix)</u> (to use UNIX sockets). The default is <u>INET</u>.  Using the <u>inet</u>  method  will  allow  access  from
           other  machines (subject to access controls) but using <u>localhost</u> or <u>local</u> will not. Localhost is most
           useful for private access and when the machine in question is not connected to the Internet. The unix
           method also can be used for private access and non-Internet connections (Unix platforms only).

           Once defined, the first registration of an XPA access point will ensure that an instance of  the  XPA
           Name  Server  (xpans)  is running that handles that connection method. All new access points will use
           the new connection method but existing access points will use the original method.

       •   <b>XPA_NSINET</b>

           For the <u>inet</u> method of socket connection, this variable specifies the host and port on which the  XPA
           Name  Server  (xpans)  is listens for new access points. The default is <u>$host:$port</u>, meaning that the
           default XPA port (14285) on the current machine (as returned by <u>gethostname()</u>) is  used.  If  several
           machines  were  all accessing the same XPA access points, you would use this variable to specify that
           they all use the same name server to find out about these access points.  For  example,  a  value  of
           <u>myhost:$port</u>  would  mean  that  the xpans name server is running on myhost and uses the default port
           12345.  All machines would then get the XPA access points registered with that name  server,  subject
           to access controls.

           The  port used by xpans to register its XPA access point normally is taken to be one greater than the
           port on which it receives new access points from XPA servers. You can specify a specific access point
           port using the syntax machine:port1,port2, i.e., the access point port is specified after the  comma.
           For example, $host:12345,23456 will listen for new access ports on 12345 and will accept XPA commands
           on 23456.

       •   <b>XPA_NSREGISTER</b>

           This  boolean  variable  specifies whether a server registers its XPA access point with the specified
           xpans name server. The default is <u>true</u>.  If set to <u>false</u>, the access point still is set up but it  is
           not registered with xpans and therefore cannot be accessed by name. (It can be accessed by method, if
           the  latter is known.) Note that an access point can be registered later on (using -remote or -proxy,
           for example). This variable mainly is useful in cases where the Internet configuration is broken  (so
           that registration causes a DNS hang) but you still wish to and can use the server with a remote xpans
           (e.g., ds9's Virtual Observatory capability).

       •   <b>XPA_NSUNIX</b>

           For  the  <u>local</u>  method  of socket connection, this variable specifies the name of the Unix file that
           will be used to access the XPA Name Server (xpans). The default is <u>xpans_unix</u>. This variable  is  not
           usually  needed.  Note that is the <u>local</u> socket method is used, then remote machines will not be able
           to access the xpans name server or the registered XPA access points.

       •   <b>XPA_NSUSERS</b>

           This variable specifies whether other users' access points will be returned by the  XPA  Name  Server
           (xpans)  for  use by <u>xpaget</u>, <u>xpaset</u>, etc.  Generally speaking, it is sufficient to run one xpans name
           server per machine and register the access points for all users with that  xpans.   This  means,  for
           example, that if you request information from ds9 by running:

             xpaget ds9 colormap

           you  might  get  information  from  your own ds9 as well as from another user running ds9 on the same
           machine.  The <u>XPA_NSUSERS</u> variable controls whether you want such access  to  the  access  points  of
           other  users.   By  default, only your own access points are returned, so that, in the example above,
           you would only get the colormap information from the ds9 you registered. If, however, you had set the
           value of the <u>XPA_NSUSERS</u> variable to <u>eric,fred</u>, then you would be able to communicate with both  eric
           and  fred's  access  points.  Note  that  this  variable can be overridden using the <u>-u</u> switch on the
           <u>xpaget</u>, <u>xpaset</u>, and <u>xpainfo</u> programs.

       •   <b>XPA_PORT</b>

           A semi-colon delimited list of user specified ports to use for specific XPA access points. The format
           is each specification is:

           class:template port1[ port2]

           where <b>port1</b> is the main (command) port for the access point and <b>port2</b> is the (secondary)  data  port.
           If port2 is not specified, it defaults to a value of 0 (meaning the system assigns the port).

           Specification  of  specific  ports is useful, for example, when a machine outside a firewall needs to
           communicate with a machine inside a firewall. In such a case, the firewall should  be  configured  to
           allow  socket  connections to both the command and data port from the outside machine, and the inside
           XPA program should be started up with the outside machine in its ACL  list.  Then,  when  the  inside
           program  is  started with specified ports, outside XPA programs can use "machine:port" to contact the
           inside access points, instead of the access point names. That is, the machine  outside  the  firewall
           does not need access to the XPA name server:

           export XPA_PORT="DS9:ds9 12345 12346"   # on machine "inside" cat foo.fits | xpaset inside:12345 fits
           # on machine "outside"

           Note  that  2 ports are required for full XPA communication and therefore 2 ports should be specified
           to go through a firewall.  The second port assignment is not important if you  simply  are  assigning
           the  command  port in order to communicate commands with a known port (e.g., to bypass the xpans name
           server). If only one (command) port is specified, the system will negotiate a random  data  port  and
           everything will work properly.

           This support is somewhat experimental. If you run into problems, please let us know.

       •   <b>XPA_PORTFILE</b>

           A list of user-specified port to use for specific xpa access points.  The format of the file is:

           class:template port1 [port2]

           where  <b>port1</b>  is  the  main  port  for  the  access point and <b>port2</b> is the data port. If port2 is not
           specified, it defaults to a value of 0 (meaning the system assigns the port).  See <b>XPA_PORT</b> above for
           an explanation of user-specified ports.

       •   <b>XPA_SHORT_TIMEOUT</b>

           XPA is designed to allow data to be sent from one process to another  over  a  long  period  of  time
           (i.e.,  a  program  that generates image data sends that data to an image display, but slowly) but it
           also seeks to prevent hangs. This is done by supporting  2  timeout  periods:  a  <u>short</u>  timeout  for
           protocol communication and a <u>long</u> for data communication.

           The <u>XPA_SHORT_TIMEOUT</u> variable controls the <u>short</u> timeout and is used to prevent hangs in cases where
           the  XPA protocol requires internal communication between the client and server that is controlled by
           the XPA interface itself. Authentication is an example of this  sort  of  communication,  as  is  the
           establishment  of  a  data  channel between the two processes.  The default value for the <u>short</u> is 30
           seconds (which is a pretty long time, actually). Setting the value to -1 will disable <u>short</u>  timeouts
           and allow an infinite amount of time.

       •   <b>XPA_SIGUSR1</b>

           If  the  value  of  this variable is <u>true</u>, then XPA will catch SIGUSR1 signals when performing an I/O
           operation in order to curtail that operation. This facility allows users to send a SIGUSR1 signal  to
           an  XPA server if a client is hanging up the server by sending or receiving data too slowly (timeouts
           also can be used -- see above). When enabled in this way, the SIGUSR1 signal is ignored at all  other
           times,  so  that  its  safe  to  send  the signal at any time.  If the variable is set to <u>false</u>, then
           SIGUSR1 is not used at all. Turning off SIGUSR1 would be desired in  cases  there  the  program  uses
           SIGUSR1 for some other reason and does not want XPA interfering.  The default is to use the signal.

       •   <b>XPA_TIMESTAMP_ERRORS</b>

           If  <u>XPA_TIMESTAMP_ERRORS</u>  is  <u>true</u>, then error messages will include a date/time string.  This can be
           useful when XPA errors are being saved in an error log (e.g. Web/CGI use). The default is false.

       •   <b>XPA_TMPDIR</b>

           This variable specifies the directory into which XPA logs, Unix  socket  files  (when  <u>XPA_METHOD</u>  is
           <u>local</u>), etc. are stored. The default is <u>/tmp/.xpa</u>.

       •   <b>XPA_VERBOSITY</b>

           Specify the verbosity level of error messages. If the value is set to <u>0</u>, <u>false</u>, or <u>off</u>, then no error
           messages are printed to stderr.  If the value is <u>1</u>, then important XPA error messages will be output.
           If  the value is set to <u>2</u>, XPA warnings about out-of-sync messages will also be output.  These latter
           almost always can be ignored.

       •   <b>XPA_VERSIONCHECK</b>

           Specify whether a new access point should check its major and minor XPA version  number  against  the
           version  used  by  the  xpans name server at registration time. The default is <u>true</u>. When checking is
           performed, a warning is issued if the server major version is found to  be  greater  than  the  xpans
           version.  Note  that  the  check  is  performed  both  by the XPA server and by the xpans process and
           warnings will be issued by each.  Also, instead of the values of <u>true</u> or <u>false</u>,  you  can  give  this
           variable  an  integer  value  n.  In  this case, each version checking process (i.e., the XPA-enabled
           server or xpans) will print out a maximum of n warning messages (after  which  version  warnings  are
           silently swallowed).

           In  general,  it is a bad idea to run an XPA-enabled server program using a version of XPA newer than
           the basic xpaset, xpaget, xpaaccess, xpans programs. This sort of mismatch usually will not work  due
           to protocol changes.
