       FunEnv - Funtools Environment Variables

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Describes the environment variables which can be used to tailor the overall Funtools environment.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables are supported by Funtools:

       •   <b>FITS_EXTNAME</b>

           The  <b>FITS_EXTNAME</b>  environment  variable  specifies the default FITS extension name when <u>FunOpen()</u> is
           called on a file lacking a primary image. Thus,

             setenv FITS_EXTNAME "NEWEV"

           will allow you to  call  <u>FunOpen()</u>  on  files  without  specifying  NEWEV  in  the  Funtools  bracket
           specification.   If  no FITS_EXTNAME variable is defined and the extension name also is not passed in
           the bracket specification, then the default will be to look for standard X-ray event table  extension
           names "EVENTS" or "STDEVT" (we are, after all, and X-ray astronomy group at heart!).

       •   <b>FITS_EXTNUM</b>

           The  <b>FITS_EXTNUM</b>  environment  variable specifies the default FITS extension number when <u>FunOpen()</u> is
           called on a file lacking a primary image. Thus,

             setenv FITS_EXTNUM 7

           will allow you to call <u>FunOpen()</u> on files to open the seventh extension without specifying the number
           in the Funtools bracket specification.

       •   <b>FITS_BINCOLS</b> and <b>EVENTS_BINCOLS</b>

           These environment variable specifies the default binning key for FITS binary  tables  and  raw  event
           files,  respectively. They can be over-ridden using the <b>bincols=[naxis1,naxis2]</b> keyword in a Funtools
           bracket specification.  The value of each environment variable is a pair of comma-delimited  columns,
           enclosed  in  parentheses,  to  use for binning.  For example, if you want to bin on detx and dety by
           default, then use:

             setenv FITS_BINCOLS "(detx,dety)"

           in preference to adding a bincols specification to each filename:

             foo.fits[bincols=(detx,dety)]

       •   <b>FITS_BITPIX</b> and <b>EVENTS_BITPIX</b>

           These environment variable specifies the default bitpix value for binning FITS binary tables and  raw
           event  files,  respectively.  They  can be over-ridden using the <b>bitpix=[value]</b> keyword in a Funtools
           bracket specification.  The value of each environment variable is one of  the  standard  FITS  bitpix
           values (8,16,32,-32,-64).  For example, if you want binning routines to create a floating array, then
           use:

             setenv FITS_BITPIX -32

           in preference to adding a bitpix specification to each filename:

             foo.fits[bitpix=-32]

       •   <b>ARRAY</b>

           The <b>ARRAY</b> environment variable specifies the default definition of an array file for Funtools.  It is
           used  if  there  is  no  array  specification  passed  in  the  <u><b>ARRAY()</b></u> directive in a Non-FITS Array
           specification.  The value of the environment variable is a valid array specification such as:

             setenv ARRAY "s100.150"
             foo.arr[ARRAY()]

           This can be defined in preference to adding the specification to each filename:

             foo.arr[ARRAY(s100.150)]

       •   <b>EVENTS</b>

           The <b>EVENTS</b> environment variable specifies the default definition of an raw event file  for  Funtools.
           It  is used if there is no EVENTS specification passed in the <u><b>EVENTS()</b></u> directive in a Non-FITS EVENTS
           specification.  The value of the environment variable is a valid EVENTS specification such as:

             setenv EVENTS "x:J:1024,y:J:1024,pi:I,pha:I,time:D,dx:E:1024,dx:E:1024"
             foo.ev[EVENTS()]

           This can be defined in preference to adding the specification to each filename:

             foo.ev[EVENTS(x:J:1024,y:J:1024,pi:I,pha:I,time:D,dx:E:1024,dx:E:1024)]

       The following filter-related environment variables are supported by Funtools:

       •   <b>FILTER_PTYPE</b>

           The <b>FILTER_PTYPE</b> environment variable specifies how to build a  filter.   There  are  three  possible
           methods:

           •   process or p

               The  filter  is  compiled  and  linked  against  the  funtools  library  (which must therefore be
               accessible in the original install directory) to produce a slave program.  This  program  is  fed
               events or image data and returns filter results.

           •   dynamic or d (gcc only)

               The  filter  is  compiled  and  linked  against  the  funtools  library  (which must therefore be
               accessible in the original install directory) to produce a dynamic shared object, which is loaded
               into the funtools program and executed as  a  subroutine.  (Extensive  testing  has  shown  that,
               contrary to expectations, this method is no faster than using a slave process.)

           •   contained or c

               The  filter  and  all  supporting  region  code  is  compiled and linked without reference to the
               funtools library to produce a slave program (which is fed events or image data and returns filter
               results). This method is slower than the other two, because of the time it takes to  compile  the
               region  filtering  code. It is used by stand-alone programs such as ds9, which do not have access
               to the funtools library.

           By default, <b>dynamic</b> is generally used for gcc compilers and <b>process</b> for other compilers. However  the
           filter  building algorithm will check for required external files and will use <b>contained</b> is these are
           missing.

       •   <b>FUN_MAXROW</b>

           The <b>FUN_MAXROW</b> environment variable is used  by  core  row-processing  Funtools  programs  (funtable,
           fundisp,  funcnts,  funhist,  funmerge,  and  funcalc) to set the maximum number of rows read at once
           (i.e. it sets the third argument to the <u>FunTableRowGet()</u> call).  The default is 8192. Note that  this
           variable  is  a  convention only: it will not be a part of a non-core Funtools program unless code is
           explicitly added, since each call to <u>FunTableRowGet()</u> specifies its own maximum  number  of  rows  to
           read.  NB:  if you make this value very large, you probably will need to increase <b>FUN_MAXBUFSIZE</b> (see
           below) as well.

       •   <b>FUN_MAXBUFSIZE</b>

           The <b>FUN_MAXBUFSIZE</b> environment variable is used to limit the max buffer size that will  be  allocated
           to hold table row data.  This buffer size is calculated to be the row size of the table multiplied by
           the  maximum  number  of  rows read at once (see above). Since the row size is unlimited (and we have
           examples of it being larger than 5 Mb), it is possible that the total buffer  size  will  exceed  the
           machine  capabilities.  We  therefore  set a default value of 5Mb for the max buffer size, and adjust
           maxrow so that the total size calculated is less than this max buffer  size.  (If  the  row  size  is
           greater  than  this  max buffer size, then maxrow is set to 1.) This environment variable will change
           the max buffer size allowed.

       •   <b>FILTER_CC</b>

           The  <b>FILTER_CC</b>  environment  variable  specifies  the  compiler  to  use  for  compiling   a   filter
           specification.  You  also can use the <b>CC</b> environment variable. If neither has been set, then gcc will
           be used if available. Otherwise cc is used if available.

       •   <b>FILTER_EXTRA</b>

           The <b>FILTER_EXTRA</b> environment variable specifies extra options to add  to  a  filter  compile  command
           line. In principle, you can add libraries, include files, and compiler switches. This variable should
           be used with care.

       •   <b>FILTER_TMPDIR</b>

           The  <b>FILTER_TMPDIR</b>  environment  variable  specifies  the  temporary directory for filter compilation
           intermediate files. You also can use the <b>TMPDIR</b> and <b>TMP</b> variables. By default, <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> is  used  as  the
           temporary directory.

       •   <b>FILTER_KEEP</b>

           The  <b>FILTER_KEEP</b>  environment variable specifies whether the intermediate filter files (i.e. C source
           file and compile log file) should be saved after a filter is built. The default is "false",  so  that
           these intermediate files are deleted. This variable is useful for debugging, but care should be taken
           to reset its value to false when debugging is complete.
