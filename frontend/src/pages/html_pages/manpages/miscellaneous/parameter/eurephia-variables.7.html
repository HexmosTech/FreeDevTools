</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       eurephia-variables - eurephia configuration variables

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Overview  over  all eurephia configuration variables.  These variables are stored in the database and can
       be modified by the <b>eurephiadm</b> <b>config</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>PASSWORD</b> <b>HASH</b></h4><pre>
       These variables are related to the password hash configuration.  All of them must be set, but they can be
       changed over time without affecting the functionality of the already stored passwords.

       These parameters are the first to be set when <b>eurephia_init</b> is run.  The minimum and maximum hash rounds
       are bechmarked for you with this tool to find more suitable numbers for the hardware eurephia will be
       running on.

       <b>passwordhash_salt_length</b>
              Sets number of bytes to use for the password hash salt.

       <b>passwordhash_rounds_min</b>
              Sets the minimum number of hashing rounds to perform when calculating new password hashes.

       <b>passwordhash_rounds_max</b>
              Sets the maximum number of hashing rounds to perform when calculating new password hashes

</pre><h4><b>ATTEMPTS</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       eurephia can blacklist user names, certificates and IP addresses based on number of failed attempts.  The
       following parameters defines the limits of how many attempts you are willing to allow before blacklisting
       them.

       <b>allow_cert_attempts</b>
              Defines the number of attempts of failed login attempts you allow before you  will  blacklist  the
              OpenVPN clients cerrtificate.  This number should normally be higher than <b>allow_username_attempts</b>.
              Default is 5.

       <b>allow_username_attempts</b>
              Defines  the  number  of failed ttempts for a user name can be tried before you will blacklist the
              user name from further attempts.  Default is 3.

       <b>allow_ipaddr_attempts</b>
              Defines the number of failed attempts for an IP address to be used before you will  blacklist  the
              IP address from further attempts.  This one should be the least strictest limit.  You also need to
              consider  if  your  clients  will log in via a proxy or NATed network and how many of your clients
              will do so.  If you experience many users failing to log on and more of them are behind  the  same
              proxy  or NAT gateway, this may blacklist the IP address quicker than intended.  But if among many
              failing attempts a valid authentication happens, the attempts counter will be reset again, so this
              limit do not need to be too forgiving.  Default is 10.

</pre><h4><b>FIREWALL</b> <b>INTEGRATION</b></h4><pre>
       If you are running the OpenVPN server with eurephia on a Linux server, it is  possible  to  let  eurephia
       interact  with  the  firewall  as  well.   These  settings  will enable the firewall integration and tell
       eurephia how to interact with the firewall.  These parameters are very <b>iptables</b> oriented.   The  <b>iptables</b>
       firewall module must be enabled at compile time and be installed to work.

       <b>firewall_interface</b>
              This  is the variable which enables firewall integration. This variable must point at the firewall
              driver, which is a shared object file which eurephia will load  dynamically.   These  drivers  are
              prefixed  <b>efw</b>  and  will  be  found  in  the  same <b>lib</b> or <b>lib64</b> directory as the <b>eurephia-auth</b> and
              <b>edb-sqlite</b> modules.  The variable must contain the full path to the driver module.

       <b>firewall_command</b>
              This defines the binary the firewall module  will  execute  to  help  update  the  firewall.   For
              <b>iptables</b> this defaults to <b><a href="file:/sbin/iptables">/sbin/iptables</a></b>.

       <b>firewall_destination</b>
              Defines  which  predefined  firewall rule to use when updating the firewall.  The default value is
              <b>vpn_users</b>.

       <b>firewall_blacklist_destination</b>
              This activates firewall based IP address blacklisting in addition to  the  internal  blacklist  in
              eurephia.   This  variable  defines  which  firewall  rule  to use when wanting to blacklist an IP
              address.

       <b>firewall_blacklist_send_to</b>
              This is an optional parameter.  Normally when eurephia blacklists an IP address it will default to
              drop the network packets from that client. You can use this variable to send  it  to  a  different
              firewall target.  This is useful if you to, for example, log the incident to the system log before
              dropping the packets.

</pre><h4><b>EUREPHIA</b> <b>UTILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       These settings are used by the eurephia administration utility, <b>eurephiadm</b>.

       <b>eurephiadmin_autologout</b>
              This  defines  how  long  a  eurephia administration utility may have an open session before it is
              considered inactive.  When exceeding this limit, the administrator user will be out automatically.
              The unit for this setting is minutes and the default value is 10.

       <b>eurephiadm_xslt_path</b>
              The <b>eurephiadm</b> utility uses XSLT templates for generating the output to the screen.  This variable
              gives you the possibility to have your own set of templates in a different  directory  instead  of
              using the system wide XSLT templates installed by default.  This variable is not set by default.

</pre><h4><b>OPENVPN</b> <b>RELATED</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>openvpn_devtype</b>
              The  <b>eurephia-auth</b>  plug-in  will  try to auto-detect the device type, which must be either tun or
              tap.  If this auto-detection fails, this configuration variable needs to be set  to  <b>tun</b>  or  <b>tap</b>.
              This value must correspond to the OpenVPN configuration.
