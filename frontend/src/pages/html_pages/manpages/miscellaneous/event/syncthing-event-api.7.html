</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       syncthing-event-api - Event API

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Syncthing  provides  a  simple long polling interface for exposing events from the core utility towards a
       GUI. To receive events, see <u>GET</u> <u>/rest/events</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>STRUCTURE</b></h4><pre>
       Each event is represented by an object similar to the following:

          {
              "id": 2,
              "globalID": 3,
              "type": "DeviceConnected",
              "time": "2014-07-13T21:04:33.687836696+02:00",
              "data": {
                  "addr": "172.16.32.25:22000",
                  "id": "NFGKEKE-7Z6RTH7-I3PRZXS-DEJF3UJ-FRWJBFO-VBBTDND-4SGNGVZ-QUQHJAG"
              }
          }

       The top level keys <b>id</b>, <b>globalID</b>, <b>time</b>, <b>type</b> and <b>data</b> are always present, though <b>data</b> may be <b>null</b>.

       <b>id</b>     A unique ID for this event on the events API. It always increases by 1: the first event  generated
              has  id  <b>1</b>,  the next has id <b>2</b> etc. If this increases by more than 1, then one or more events have
              been skipped by the events API.

       <b>globalID</b>
              A global ID for this event, across the events API, the audit log, and any other  sources.  It  may
              increase by more than 1, but it will always be greater than or equal to the id.

       <b>time</b>   The time the event was generated.

       <b>type</b>   Indicates the type of (i.e. reason for) the event and is one of the event types below.

       <b>data</b>   An  object  containing  optional extra information; the exact structure is determined by the event
              type.

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ClusterConfigReceived</b>
       Added in version 1.20.0.

       The <b>ClusterConfigReceived</b> event is emitted after processing such  a  protocol  message  received  from  a
       remote device.  It is mainly used for internal purposes.

          {
              "id": 84,
              "globalID": 84,
              "type": "ClusterConfigReceived",
              "time": "2022-04-27T14:14:27.043576583+09:00",
              "data": {
                  "device": "I6KAH76-66SLLLB-5PFXSOA-UFJCDZC-YAOMLEK-CP2GB32-BV5RQST-3PSROAU"
              }
          }

   <b>ConfigSaved</b>
       Emitted after the config has been saved by the user or by Syncthing itself.

          {
              "id": 50,
              "globalID": 50,
              "type": "ConfigSaved",
              "time": "2014-12-13T00:09:13.5166486Z",
              "data": {
                  "version": 7,
                  "folders": [{"..."}],
                  "devices": [{"..."}],
                  "gui": {"..."},
                  "ldap": {"..."},
                  "options": {"..."},
                  "remoteIgnoredDevices": [{"..."}],
                  "defaults": {"..."}
              }
          }

   <b>DeviceConnected</b>
       Generated each time a connection to a device has been established.

          {
              "id": 2,
              "globalID": 2,
              "type": "DeviceConnected",
              "time": "2014-07-13T21:04:33.687836696+02:00",
              "data": {
                  "addr": "172.16.32.25:22000",
                  "id": "NFGKEKE-7Z6RTH7-I3PRZXS-DEJF3UJ-FRWJBFO-VBBTDND-4SGNGVZ-QUQHJAG",
                  "deviceName": "Laptop",
                  "clientName": "syncthing",
                  "clientVersion": "v0.13.4",
                  "type": "TCP (Client)"
              }
          }

   <b>DeviceDisconnected</b>
       Generated each time a connection to a device has been terminated.

          {
              "id": 48,
              "globalID": 48,
              "type": "DeviceDisconnected",
              "time": "2014-07-13T21:18:52.859929215+02:00",
              "data": {
                  "error": "unexpected EOF",
                  "id": "NFGKEKE-7Z6RTH7-I3PRZXS-DEJF3UJ-FRWJBFO-VBBTDND-4SGNGVZ-QUQHJAG"
              }
          }

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The  error  key contains the cause for disconnection, which might not necessarily be an error as such.
          Specifically, “EOF” and “unexpected EOF” both signify TCP connection termination, either  due  to  the
          other device restarting or going offline or due to a network change.

   <b>DeviceDiscovered</b>
       Emitted when a new device is discovered using local discovery.

          {
              "id": 13,
              "globalID": 13,
              "type": "DeviceDiscovered",
              "time": "2014-07-17T13:28:05.043465207+02:00",
              "data": {
                  "addrs": [
                      "172.16.32.25:22000"
                  ],
                  "device": "NFGKEKE-7Z6RTH7-I3PRZXS-DEJF3UJ-FRWJBFO-VBBTDND-4SGNGVZ-QUQHJAG"
              }
          }

   <b>DevicePaused</b>
       Emitted when a device was paused.

          {
              "id": 13,
              "globalID": 13,
              "type": "DevicePaused",
              "time": "2014-07-17T13:28:05.043465207+02:00",
              "data": {
                  "device": "NFGKEKE-7Z6RTH7-I3PRZXS-DEJF3UJ-FRWJBFO-VBBTDND-4SGNGVZ-QUQHJAG"
              }
          }

   <b>DeviceRejected</b> <b>(DEPRECATED)</b>
       Deprecated since version v1.13.0: This event is still emitted for compatibility, but deprecated.  Use the
       replacement <u>PendingDevicesChanged</u> event instead.

       Emitted when there is a connection from a device we are not configured to talk to.

          {
              "id": 24,
              "globalID": 24,

              }
          }

   <b>DeviceResumed</b>
       Generated each time a device was resumed.

          {
              "id": 2,
              "globalID": 2,
              "type": "DeviceResumed",

              "data": {
                  "device": "NFGKEKE-7Z6RTH7-I3PRZXS-DEJF3UJ-FRWJBFO-VBBTDND-4SGNGVZ-QUQHJAG"
              }
          }

   <b>DownloadProgress</b>
       Emitted during file downloads for each folder for each file. By default only a single file in a folder is
       handled at the same time, but custom configuration can cause multiple files to be shown.

          {
              "id": 221,
              "globalID": 221,

                  }
              }
          }

       • <b>total</b> - total number of blocks in the file

       • <b>pulling</b> - number of blocks currently being downloaded

       • <b>copiedFromOrigin</b> - number of blocks copied from the file we are about to replace

       • <b>reused</b> - number of blocks reused from a previous temporary file

       • <b>copiedFromElsewhere</b> - number of blocks copied from other files or potentially other folders

       • <b>pulled</b> - number of blocks actually downloaded so far

       • <b>bytesTotal</b> - approximate total file size

       • <b>bytesDone</b> - approximate number of bytes already handled (already reused, copied or pulled)

       Where block size is 128KB.

       Files/folders  appearing in the event data imply that the download has been started for that file/folder,
       where disappearing implies that the downloads have been finished or failed for that file/folder. There is
       always a last event emitted with no data, which implies all downloads have finished/failed.

   <b>Failure</b>
       Generated for specific errors that will also be sent to the usage reporting server,  if  enabled  in  the
       configuration.   These  are usually of special interest to the developers to troubleshoot complex errors.
       The <b>data</b> field contains a textual error message.

          {
            "id": 93,
            "globalID": 93,
            "type": "Failure",
            "time": "2021-06-07T21:22:03.414609034+02:00",
            "data": "index handler got paused while already paused"
          }

   <b>FolderCompletion</b>
       The <b>FolderCompletion</b> event is emitted when the local or remote contents for a folder changes. It contains
       the completion percentage for a given remote device and is emitted once per  currently  connected  remote
       device.

       Added in version 1.20.0: Indication whether the remote device has accepted the folder (shares it with us)
       as  well,  and  whether  it  is  paused.   The <b>remoteState</b> field is <b>unknown</b> when the remote device is not
       connected.  Otherwise it can be either <b>paused</b>, <b>notSharing</b>, or <b>valid</b> if the remote is sharing back.

          {
              "id": 84,
              "globalID": 84,
              "type": "FolderCompletion",

                  "sequence": 12
              }
          }

   <b>FolderErrors</b>
       The <b>FolderErrors</b> event is emitted when a folder cannot be successfully synchronized. The  event  contains
       the  ID of the affected folder and a list of errors for files or directories therein. This list of errors
       is obsolete once the folder changes state to <b>syncing</b> - if errors remain after  the  next  synchronization
       attempt, a new <b>FolderErrors</b> event is emitted.

          {
              "id": 132,
              "type": "FolderErrors",
              "time": "2015-06-26T13:39:24.697401384+02:00",

                  "folder": "default"
              }
          }

       Added in version 0.11.12.

       <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
          The <u>StateChanged</u> event.

   <b>FolderPaused</b>
       Generated  when  the configuration changes regarding the “paused” state of a folder.  Sent repeatedly for
       each changed folder.

          {
            "id": 93,

       Deprecated since version v1.13.0: This event is still emitted for compatibility, but deprecated.  Use the
       replacement <u>PendingFoldersChanged</u> event instead.

       Emitted when a device sends index information for a folder we do not have, or have but do not share  with
       the device in question.
