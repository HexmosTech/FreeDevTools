       groff_mm - memorandum macros for GNU <u>roff</u>

</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
       <b>groff</b> <b>-mm</b> [<u>option</u> ...] [<u>file</u> ...]
       <b>groff</b> <b>-m</b> <b>mm</b> [<u>option</u> ...] [<u>file</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The  GNU  implementation of the <u>mm</u> macro package is part of the <u>groff</u> document formatting system.  The <u>mm</u>
       package is suitable for the composition of letters, memoranda, reports, and books.

       Call an <u>mm</u> macro at the beginning of a document to initialize the package.  A simple  <u>mm</u>  document  might
       use  only  <b>P</b> for paragraphing.  Set numbered and unnumbered section headings with <b>H</b> and <b>HU</b>, respectively.
       Change the style of the typeface with <b>B</b>, <b>I</b>, and <b>R</b>; you can alternate styles with <b>BI</b>, <b>BR</b>, <b>IB</b>, <b>IR</b>, <b>RB</b>,  and
       <b>RI</b>.   Several nestable list types are available via <b>AL</b>, <b>BL</b>, <b>BVL</b>, <b>DL</b>, <b>ML</b>, <b>RL</b>, and <b>VL</b>; each of these begins
       a list, to which <b>LI</b> adds an item and <b>LE</b>  ends  the  (nested)  list.   Customized  list  arrangements  are
       supported  by  <b>LB</b>.  <b>DS</b> and <b>DF</b> start static and floating displays, respectively; either is terminated with
       <b>DE</b>.

       <u>groff</u> <u>mm</u> is intended to be compatible with the <u>mm</u> implementation found in the AT&amp;T Documenter's Workbench
       (DWB), with the following limitations.

       • Omitted features include the logo and company name  strings,  <b>}Z</b>  and  <b>]S</b>,  respectively;  the  encoded
         company  site  location  addresses  recognized as the third argument to the <b>AU</b> macro; the <b>Pv</b> (“private”
         heading) register; and the <b>OK</b> (other keywords), and <b>PM</b> (proprietary markings) macros.

       • The <b>CS</b> (output cover sheet) macro is implemented only for memorandum type 4.

       • The <u>grap</u> preprocessor is not explicitly supported; no <b>G1</b> and <b>G2</b> macros are defined.

       • The registers <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>T</b>, and <b>U</b>, typically set from the <u>troff</u> or <u>nroff</u> command lines with DWB  <u>mm</u>,  are
         not recognized.

       • When  setting  the  registers  <b>L</b>  or  <b>W</b>  from  the  command line, use an explicit scaling unit to avoid
         surprises.

       • DWB <u>mm</u>'s <b>nP</b> macro indented the second line of a paragraph to align it with the start of the text of the
         first (after the paragraph number); <u>groff</u> <u>mm</u>'s does not.

       • Cut marks are not supported.

       DWB <u>mm</u> supported only seven levels of heading.  As a compatible extension, <u>groff</u>  <u>mm</u>  supports  fourteen,
       introducing new registers <b>H8</b> through <b>H14</b>, and affecting the interpretation of the <b>HF</b> and <b>HP</b> strings.

       Macro,  register,  and  string  descriptions  in  this  page  frequently  mention  each other; most cross
       references are to macros.  Where a register or string is referenced, its type is  explicitly  identified.
       <u>mm</u>'s macro names are usually in full capitals; registers and strings tend to have mixed-case names.

   <b>Document</b> <b>styles</b>
       <u>groff</u>  <u>mm</u>  offers three different frameworks for document organization.  <b>COVER</b>/<b>COVEND</b> is a flexible means
       of preparing any document  requiring  a  cover  page.   <b>LT</b>/<b>LO</b>  aids  preparation  of  typical  Anglophone
       correspondence  (business  letters, for example).  The <b>MT</b> memorandum type mechanism implements a group of
       formal styles historically used by AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories.  Your document can select at most one of these
       approaches; when used, each disables the others.

   <b>Localization</b>
       <u>groff</u> <u>mm</u> is designed to be easily localized.  For languages other than English, strings that  can  appear
       in  output  are  collected  in the file <u><a href="file:/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/">/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/</a></u>xx<u>.tmac</u>, where <u>xx</u> is an ISO 639 two-
       letter language identifier.  Localization packages should be loaded after  <u>mm</u>;  for  example,  you  might
       format a Swedish <u>mm</u> document with the command “<b>groff</b> <b>-mm</b> <b>-msv</b>”.

       This  package  can  also be localized by site or territory; for example, <u>/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mse</u>
       <u>.tmac</u> illustrates how to adapt the output to a national standard using its ISO 3166 territory code.  Such
       a package can define a string that causes a macro  file  <u>/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mm/</u>territory<b>_</b><u>locale</u>
       to  be loaded at package initialization.  If this mechanism is not used, <u>/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mm/</u>
       <u>locale</u> is loaded instead.  No diagnostic is produced if these files do not exist.

   <b>Registers</b> <b>and</b> <b>strings</b>
       Much <u>mm</u> behavior can be configured by registers and strings.  A register is assigned with the <b>nr</b> request.

              <b>.nr</b> <u>ident</u> [<b>±</b>]<u>n</u> [<u>i</u>]

       <u>ident</u> is the name of the register, and <u>n</u> is the value to be assigned.  <u>n</u> can be prefixed with a  plus  or
       minus  sign  if  incrementation or decrementation (respectively) of the register's existing value by <u>n</u> is
       desired.  If assignment of a (possibly) negative <u>n</u> is required, further prefix it with a zero or  enclose
       it in parentheses.  If <u>i</u> is specified, the register is automatically modified by <u>i</u> prior to interpolation
       if a plus or minus sign is included in the escape sequence as follows.

              <b>\n</b>[<b>±</b>]<b>[</b><u>ident</u><b>]</b>

       <u>i</u> can be negative; it combines algebraically with the sign in the interpolation escape sequence.

       Strings are defined with the <b>ds</b> request.

              <b>.ds</b> <u>ident</u> <u>contents</u>

       <u>contents</u> consumes everything up to the end of the line, including trailing spaces.  It is a good practice
       to  end  <u>contents</u>  with  a  comment  escape sequence (<b>\"</b>) so that extraneous spaces do not intrude during
       document maintenance.  To include leading spaces in <u>contents</u>, prefix it with a double quote.  Strings are
       interpolated with the <b>\*</b> escape sequence.

              <b>\*[</b><u>ident</u><b>]</b>

       Register and string name spaces are distinct, but strings and macros share  a  name  space.   Defining  a
       string with the same name as an <u>mm</u> macro is not supported and may cause incorrect rendering, the emission
       of diagnostic messages, and an error exit status from <u>troff</u>.

   <b>Register</b> <b>format</b>
       A  register  is  interpolated using Arabic numerals if no other format has been assigned to it.  Assign a
       format to a register with the <b>af</b> request.

              <b>.af</b> <u>R</u> <u>c</u>

       <u>R</u> is the name of the register, and <u>c</u> is the format.  If  <u>c</u>  is  a  sequence  of  Arabic  numerals,  their
       quantity defines a zero-padded minimum width for the interpolated register value.

              <b>Form</b>   <b>Sequence</b>
              1      0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 10, ...
              001    000, 001, 002, 003, ..., 1000, ...
              i      0, i, ii, iii, iv, ...
              I      0, I, II, III, IV, ...
              a      0, a, b, c, ..., z, aa, ab, ...
              A      0, A, B, C, ..., Z, AA, AB, ...

   <b>Fonts</b>
       In  <u>groff</u>  <u>mm</u>, the fonts (or rather, font styles) <b>R</b> (roman), <b>I</b> (italic), and <b>B</b> (bold) are mounted at font
       positions <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>, respectively.  Internally, font positions are  used  for  backward  compatibility.
       From  a  practical  point  of view, it doesn't make a big difference—a different font family can still be
       selected by invoking <u>groff</u>'s <b>fam</b> request or using its <b>-f</b> command-line option.  On the other hand, if  you
       want  to replace just, for example, font <b>I</b> with Zapf Chancery Medium italic (available on <u>groff</u>'s <b>pdf</b> and
       <b>ps</b> output devices), you have to use the <b>fp</b> request, replacing the font at position 2 with “<b>.fp</b> <b>2</b>  <b>ZCMI</b>”).
       Because  the cover sheet, memorandum type, and <u><a href="../man1/refer.1.html">refer</a></u>(1) integration macros explicitly request fonts named
       <b>B</b>, <b>I</b>, and <b>R</b>, you will also need to remap these font  names  with  the  <b>ftr</b>  request,  for  instance  with
       “<b>.ftr</b> <b>I</b> <b>ZCMI</b>”.

</pre><h4><b>Macros</b></h4><pre>
       An  explicitly  empty  argument may be specified with a pair of double quotes; to call a macro <b>XX</b> with an
       empty second argument but non-empty first and third ones, you could input the following.

              .XX foo "" baz

       Macro names longer than two characters are GNU extensions; some shorter names were not part of  DWB  <u>mm</u>'s
       published interface but are documented aspects of <u>groff</u> <u>mm.</u>

       <b>)E</b> <u>level</u> <u>text</u>
              Add  heading  text  <u>text</u>  to the table of contents with <u>level</u>, which is either 0 or in the range 1
              to 7.  See also <b>H</b>.  This undocumented DWB <u>mm</u> macro is exposed by <u>groff</u>  <u>mm</u>  to  enable  customized
              tables of contents.

       <b>1C</b> [<b>1</b>] Format  page text in one column.  The page is broken.  A <b>1</b> argument suppresses this break; its use
              may cause body text and a pending footnote to overprint.  See <b>2C</b>, <b>MC</b>, and <b>NCOL</b>.

       <b>2C</b>     Begin two-column formatting.  This is a special case of <b>MC</b>.  See <b>1C</b> and <b>NCOL</b>.

       <b>AE</b>     Abstract end; stop collecting abstract text.  See <b>AS</b>.

       <b>AF</b> [<u>firm-name</u>]
              Specify firm associated with the document.  At most one can be declared; the firm name is used  by
              memorandum  types  and available to cover sheets.  <b>AF</b> terminates a document title started with <b>TL</b>,
              and can be called without an argument for that purpose.  See <b>MT</b> and <b>COVER</b>.

       <b>AL</b> [<u>type</u> [<u>text-indent</u> [<b>1</b>]]]
              Begin an auto-incrementing numbered list.  Item numbers start at one.  The <u>type</u>  argument  assigns
              the  register  format  (see above) of the list item enumerators.  The default is <b>1</b>.  An explicitly
              empty <u>type</u> also indicates the default.  A <u>text-indent</u> argument overrides  register  <b>Li</b>.   A  third
              argument  suppresses the blank line that normally precedes each list item.  Use <b>LI</b> to declare list
              items, and <b>LE</b> to end the list.

       <b>APP</b> [<u>id</u> [<u>title</u>]]
              Begin an appendix.  If the identifier <u>id</u>  is  omitted,  it  is  incremented  (or  initialized,  if
              necessary).   The  register  format  used  for  <u>id</u>  is “A”.  The page is broken.  The register <b>Aph</b>
              determines whether an appendix heading is then  formatted.   This  heading  uses  the  string  <b>App</b>
              followed by <u>id</u>.  Appendices appear in any table of contents (see <b>TC</b>).  The string <b>Apptxt</b> is set to
              <u>title</u> if the latter is present, and made empty otherwise.

       <b>APPSK</b> <u>id</u> <u>n</u> [<u>title</u>]
              As <b>APP</b>, but increment the page number by <u>n</u>.  Use this macro to “skip pages” when diagrams or other
              materials not formatted by <u>troff</u> are included in appendices.

       <b>AS</b> [<u>placement</u> [<u>indentation</u>]]
              Abstract  start;  begin  collecting  abstract.   Input  up  to the next <b>AE</b> call is included in the
              abstract.  <u>placement</u> influences the location of the abstract on the cover sheet  of  a  memorandum
              (see  <b>MT</b>).   <b>COVER</b>,  by contrast, ignores <u>placement</u> by default, but can be customized to interpret
              it.

              <u><b>placement</b></u>   <b>Effect</b>
              0           The abstract appears on page 1 and cover sheet if the document is a  “released  paper”
                          memorandum (“<b>.MT</b> <b>4</b>”); otherwise, it appears on page 1 without a cover sheet.
              1           The abstract appears only on the cover sheet (“<b>.MT</b> <b>4</b>” only).

              An  abstract does not appear at all in external letters (“<b>.MT</b> <b>5</b>”).  A <u>placement</u> of <b>2</b> was supported
              by DWB <u>mm</u> but is not by <u>groff</u> <u>mm</u>.

              A second argument increases the indentation by <u>indentation</u> and reduces the line  length  by  twice
              this amount.  A scaling unit of ens is assumed.  The default is 0.

       <b>AST</b> [<u>caption</u>]
              Set  the  caption above the abstract to <u>caption</u>, or clear it if there is no argument.  The default
              is “ABSTRACT”.

       <b>AT</b> <u>title</u> ...
              Specify author's title(s).  If present, <b>AT</b> must appear just after the corresponding  author's  <b>AU</b>.
              Each  <u>title</u>  occupies  an  output line beneath the author's name in the signature block used by <b>LT</b>
              letters (see <b>SG</b>) and in <b>MT</b> memoranda.  The <b>ms</b> cover sheet style also uses it.

       <b>AU</b> [<u>name</u> [<u>initials</u> [<u>loc</u> [<u>dept</u> [<u>ext</u> [<u>room</u> [<u>arg1</u> [<u>arg2</u> [<u>arg3</u>]]]]]]]]]
              Specify author.  <b>AU</b> terminates a document title  started  with  <b>TL</b>,  and  can  be  called  without
              arguments  for  that  purpose.   Author information is used by cover sheets, <b>MT</b> memoranda, and <b>SG</b>.
              Further arguments comprise initials, location, department, telephone  extension,  room  number  or
              name, and up to three additional items.  Repeat <b>AU</b> to identify multiple authors.

              Use <b>WA</b>/<b>WE</b> instead to identify the author for documents employing <b>LT</b>.

       <b>AV</b> [<u>name</u> [<b>1</b>]]
              Format  approval lines for a handwritten signature and date.  Two horizontal rules are drawn, with
              the specified <u>name</u> and the text of the string <b>Letdate</b> beneath them.  Above these rules,  the  text
              in  the  string  <b>Letapp</b> is formatted; a second argument replaces this text with a blank line.  See
              <b>LT</b>.

       <b>AVL</b> [<u>name</u>]
              As <b>AV</b>, but the date, date rule, and approval notation <b>Letapp</b> are omitted.

       <b>B</b> [<u>bold-text</u> [<u>previous-font-text</u>]] ...
              Join <u>bold-text</u> in boldface with <u>previous-font-text</u> in the previous font, without space between the
              arguments.  If no arguments, switch font to bold style.

       <b>B1</b>     Begin boxed, kept display.  The text is indented one  character,  and  the  right  margin  is  one
              character shorter.  This is a GNU extension.

       <b>B2</b>     End boxed, kept display.  This is a GNU extension.

       <b>BE</b>     End bottom block; see <b>BS</b>.

       <b>BI</b> [<u>bold-text</u> [<u>italic-text</u>]] ...
              Join <u>bold-text</u> in boldface with <u>italic-text</u> in italics, without space between the arguments.

       <b>BL</b> [<u>text-indent</u> [<b>1</b>]]
              Begin  bulleted  list.   Items  are  prefixed  with  a bullet and a space.  A <u>text-indent</u> argument
              overrides register <b>Pi</b>.  A second argument suppresses blank lines between items.  Use <b>LI</b> to declare
              list items, and <b>LE</b> to end the list.

       <b>BR</b> [<u>bold-text</u> [<u>roman-text</u>]] ...
              Join <u>bold-text</u> in boldface with <u>roman-text</u> in roman style, without space between the arguments.

       <b>BS</b>     Begin bottom block.  Input is collected until <b>BE</b> is called, and output between the  footnote  area
              and footer of each page.

       <b>BVL</b> [<u>text-indent</u> [<u>mark-indent</u> [<b>1</b>]]]
              Begin broken variable-item (or “tagged”) list.  Each item is expected to supply its own mark.  The
              line  is always broken after the mark; contrast <b>VL</b>.  <u>text-indent</u> sets the indentation of the text,
              and <u>mark-indent</u> the distance from the current list indentation to  the  mark.   A  third  argument
              suppresses  the  blank  line that normally precedes each list item.  Use <b>LI</b> to declare list items,
              and <b>LE</b> to end the list.

       <b>COVER</b> [<u>style</u>]
              Begin a cover page description.  <b>COVER</b> must appear before the body text  (or  main  matter)  of  a
              document.   The argument <u>style</u> is used to construct the file name <u>/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mm/</u>
              style<u>.cov</u> and load it with the <b>mso</b> request.  The default <u>style</u> is <b>ms</b>; the <u>ms.cov</u> file  prepares  a
              cover  page  resembling  those of the <u>ms</u> package.  A <u>.cov</u> file must define a <b>COVEND</b> macro, which a
              document must call at the end of the cover description.   Use  cover  description  macros  in  the
              following order; only <b>TL</b> and <b>AU</b> are required.

              .COVER
              .TL
              .AF
              .AU
              .AT
              .AS
              .AE
              .COVEND

       <b>COVEND</b> End the cover description.

       <b>DE</b>     End static or floating display begun with <b>DS</b> or <b>DF</b>.

       <b>DF</b> [<u>format</u> [<u>fill</u> [<u>right-indentation</u>]]]
              Begin  floating  display.  A floating display is saved in a queue and output in the order entered.
              Arguments are handled as in <b>DS</b>.  Floating  displays  cannot  be  nested.   Placement  of  floating
              displays is controlled by the registers <b>De</b> and <b>Df</b>.

       <b>DL</b> [<u>text-indent</u> [<b>1</b>]]
              Begin  dashed  list.   Items  are  prefixed  with  an em dash and a space.  A <u>text-indent</u> argument
              overrides register <b>Pi</b>.  A second argument suppresses blank lines between items.  Use <b>LI</b> to declare
              list items, and <b>LE</b> to end the list.

       <b>DS</b> [<u>format</u> [<u>fill</u> [<u>right-indentation</u>]]]
              Begin static display.  Input until <b>DE</b> is called is collected  into  a  display.   The  display  is
              output  on  a  single  page  unless  it  is  taller than the height of the page.  <b>DS</b> can be nested
              (contrast with <b>DF</b>).

              <u><b>format</b></u>   <b>Effect</b>
              <u>none</u>     Do not indent the display.
              L        Do not indent the display.
              I        Indent text by <b>\n[Si]</b>.
              C        Center each line.
              CB       Center the whole display as a block.
              R        Right-adjust the lines.
              RB       Right-adjust the whole display as a block.

              The values “L”, “I”, “C”, and “CB” can also be specified as “0”, “1”, “2”, and “3”,  respectively,
              for compatibility with DWB <u>mm.</u>

              <u><b>fill</b></u>   <b>Effect</b>
              <u>none</u>   Disable filling.
              N      Disable filling.
              F      Enable filling.

              “N” and “F” can also be specified as “0” and “1”, respectively, for compatibility with DWB <u>mm.</u>

              A third argument reduces the line length by <u>right-indentation.</u>

              <u>mm</u>  normally  places  blank  lines before and after the display.  Set register <b>Ds</b> to 0 to suppress
              these.

       <b>EC</b> [<u>title</u> [<u>override</u> [<u>flag</u> [<u>refname</u>]]]]
              Caption an equation.  The caption consists  of  the  string  <b>Liec</b>  followed  by  an  automatically
              incrementing  counter  stored  in the register <b>Ec</b>, punctuation configured by the register <b>Of</b>, then
              <u>title</u> (if any).  Use the <b>af</b> request to configure <b>Ec</b>'s number format.  <u>override</u> and <u>flag</u> alter  the
              equation number as follows.  Omitting <u>flag</u> and specifying <b>0</b> in its place are equivalent.

              <u><b>flag</b></u>   <b>Effect</b>
              0      Prefix number with <u>override</u>.
              1      Suffix number with <u>override</u>.
              2      Replace number with <u>override</u>.

              Equation captions are centered irrespective of the alignment of any enclosing display.

              <u>refname</u>  stores  the  equation number using <b>SETR</b>; it can be retreived with “<b>.GETST</b> <u>refname</u>”.  This
              argument is a GNU extension.

              Captioned equations are listed in a table of contents (see <b>TC</b>) if the Boolean register <b>Le</b> is true.
              Such a list uses the string <b>Le</b> as a heading.

       <b>EF</b> [<b>"'</b><u>left</u><b>'</b><u>center</u><b>'</b><u>right</u><b>'"</b>]
              Define the even-page footer, which is formatted just above the normal page footer on even-numbered
              pages.  See <b>PF</b>.  <b>EF</b> defines the string <b>EOPef</b>.

       <b>EH</b> [<b>"'</b><u>left</u><b>'</b><u>center</u><b>'</b><u>right</u><b>'"</b>]
              Define the even-page header, which is formatted just below the normal page header on even-numbered
              pages.  See <b>PH</b>.  <b>EH</b> defines the string <b>TPeh</b>.

       <b>EN</b>     End equation input preprocessed by <u><a href="../man1/eqn.1.html">eqn</a></u>(1); see <b>EQ</b>.

       <b>EOP</b>    If defined, this macro is called in lieu of normal page footer layout.  Headers  and  footers  are
              formatted in a separate environment.  See <b>TP</b>.

       <b>EPIC</b> [<b>-L</b>] <u>width</u> <u>height</u> [<u>name</u>]
              Draw  a  box with the given <u>width</u> and <u>height</u>.  It also prints the text <u>name</u> or a default string if
              <u>name</u> is not specified.  This is used to include external pictures;  just  give  the  size  of  the
              picture.  <b>-L</b> left-aligns the picture; the default is to center.  See <b>PIC</b>.

       <b>EQ</b> [<u>label</u>]
              Start  equation  input  preprocessed by <u><a href="../man1/eqn.1.html">eqn</a></u>(1).  <b>EQ</b> and <b>EN</b> macro calls bracket an equation region.
              Such regions must be contained in displays (<b>DS</b>/<b>DE</b>),  except  when  the  region  is  used  only  to
              configure  <u>eqn</u>  and  not  to  produce  output.  If present, <u>label</u> appears aligned to the right and
              centered vertically within the display; see register <b>Eq</b>.  If multiple <u>eqn</u> regions occur  within  a
              display, only the last <u>label</u> (if any) is used.

       <b>EX</b> [<u>title</u> [<u>override</u> [<u>flag</u> [<u>refname</u>]]]]
              Caption  an  exhibit.   Arguments  are  handled analogously to <b>EC</b>.  The register <b>Ex</b> is the exhibit
              counter.  The string <b>Liex</b> precedes the  exhibit  number  and  any  <u>title.</u>   Exhibit  captions  are
              centered irrespective of the alignment of any enclosing display.

              Captioned  exhibits are listed in a table of contents (see <b>TC</b>) if the Boolean register <b>Lx</b> is true.
              Such a list uses the string <b>Lx</b> as a heading.

       <b>FC</b> [<u>closing-text</u>]
              Output the string <b>Letfc</b>, or the specified <u>closing-text,</u> as the formal closing of a letter.

       <b>FD</b> [<u>arg</u> [<b>1</b>]]
              Configure display of footnotes.  The first argument encodes enablement of  automatic  hyphenation,
              adjustment to the right margin, indentation of footnote text, and left- vs. right-alignment of the
              footnote label within the space allocated for it.

              <u><b>arg</b></u>   <b>Hyphenate?</b>   <b>Adjust?</b>   <b>Indent?</b>   <b>Label</b> <b>alignment</b>
              0     no           yes       yes       left
              1     yes          yes       yes       left
              2     no           no        yes       left
              3     yes          no        yes       left
              4     no           yes       no        left
              5     yes          yes       no        left
              6     no           no        no        left
              7     yes          no        no        left
              8     no           yes       yes       right
              9     yes          yes       yes       right
              10    no           no        yes       right
              11    yes          no        yes       right

              An <u>arg</u> greater than 11 is treated as <b>0</b>.  <u>mm</u>'s default is <b>0</b>.

              If  a  second argument, conventionally <b>1</b>, is given, footnote numbering is reset when a first-level
              heading is encountered.  See <b>FS</b>.

       <b>FE</b>     End footnote; see <b>FS</b>.

       <b>FG</b> [<u>title</u> [<u>override</u> [<u>flag</u> [<u>refname</u>]]]]
              Caption a figure.  Arguments are handled analogously  to  <b>EC</b>.   The  register  <b>Fg</b>  is  the  figure
              counter.   The string <b>Lifg</b> precedes the figure number and any <u>title.</u>  Figure captions are centered
              irrespective of the alignment of any enclosing display.

              Captioned figures are listed in a table of contents (see <b>TC</b>) if the Boolean register <b>Lf</b>  is  true.
              Such a list uses the string <b>Lf</b> as a heading.

       <b>FS</b> [<u>label</u>]
              Start footnote.  Input until <b>FE</b> is called is collected into a footnote.  By default, footnotes are
              automatically  numbered starting at 1; the number is available in register <b>:p</b> and, with a trailing
              period, in string <b>F</b>.  This string precedes the footnote text at the bottom of the column or  page.
              Footnotes are vertically separated by the product of registers <b>Fs</b> and <b>Lsp</b>.  In <u>groff</u> <u>mm</u>, footnotes
              may be used in displays.

              A  <u>label</u>  argument  replaces the contents of the string <b>F</b>; it need not be numeric.  In this event,
              the footnote marker in the body text must be explicitly written.

       <b>GETHN</b> <u>refname</u> [<u>varname</u>]
              Include the heading number where the corresponding “<b>.SETR</b> <u>refname</u>” was placed.  This is  displayed
              as  “X.X.X.”  in  pass  1.   See  <b>INITR</b>.  If <u>varname</u> is used, <b>GETHN</b> sets the string <u>varname</u> to the
              heading number.

       <b>GETPN</b> <u>refname</u> [<u>varname</u>]
              Include the page number where the corresponding “<b>.SETR</b> <u>refname</u>” was placed.  This is displayed  as
              “9999”  in  pass  1.   See  <b>INITR</b>.   If <u>varname</u> is used, <b>GETPN</b> sets the string <u>varname</u> to the page
              number.

       <b>GETR</b> <u>refname</u>
              Combine <b>GETHN</b> and <b>GETPN</b> with the text “chapter” and “, page”.  The string <b>Qrf</b>  contains  the  text
              for the cross reference:

                     .ds Qrf See chapter \\*[Qrfh], page \\*[Qrfp].

              <b>Qrf</b>  may be changed to support other languages.  Strings <b>Qrfh</b> and <b>Qrfp</b> are set by <b>GETR</b> and contain
              the page and heading number, respectively.

       <b>GETST</b> <u>refname</u> [<u>varname</u>]
              Include the string saved with the second argument to <b>.SETR</b>.  This is a dummy string in pass 1.  If
              <u>varname</u> is used, <b>GETST</b> sets it to the saved string.  See <b>INITR</b>.

       <b>H</b> <u>level</u> [<u>title</u> [<u>suffix</u>]]
              Set a numbered section heading at <u>level</u>.  <u>mm</u> produces numbered <u>heading</u> <u>marks</u> of the form <u>a</u>.<u>b</u>.<u>c</u>...,
              with up to fourteen levels of nesting.  Each level's number increases automatically  with  each  <b>H</b>
              call and is reset to zero when a more significant <u>level</u> is specified.  “<b>1</b>” is the most significant
              or coarsest division of the document.  Text after an <b>H</b> call is formatted as a paragraph; calling <b>P</b>
              is unnecessary.

              <u>title</u>  specifies  an  optional  title; it must be double-quoted if it contains spaces.  <u>mm</u> appends
              <u>suffix</u> to <u>title</u> in the body of the document, but omits it from any table  of  contents  (see  <b>TC</b>).
              This  facility  can  be  used  to  annotate  the heading title with a footnote.  <u>suffix</u> should not
              interpolate the <b>F</b> string; specify a footnote mark explicitly.  See <b>FS</b>.

              Heading behavior is highly configurable.  Several registers set a <u>threshold,</u> where heading  levels
              at  or below the threshold value are handled in one way, and those above it another.  For example,
              a heading level within the threshold of register <b>Cl</b> is included in the table of contents (see <b>TC</b>).

              <u>Heading</u> <u>layout.</u>  Register <b>Ej</b> sets a threshold for page breaking (ejection) prior to a heading.  If
              not preceded by a page break, a heading level below the threshold in register <b>Hps</b> is  preceded  by
              the  amount  of  vertical  space  in  register  <b>Hps1</b>, and by the amount in <b>Hps2</b> otherwise.  The <b>Hb</b>
              register sets a threshold below which a break occurs after the heading, and  register  <b>Hs</b>  sets  a
              threshold  below  which  vertical space follows it.  If the heading level is not less than both of
              these, a <u>run-in</u> <u>heading</u> is produced; paragraph text follows on the same output  line.   Otherwise,
              register  <b>Hi</b> configures the indentation of text after headings.  Threshold register <b>Hc</b> enables the
              centering of headings; a heading level below both of the <b>Hb</b> and <b>Hc</b> thresholds is centered.

              <u>Heading</u> <u>typeface</u> <u>and</u> <u>size.</u>  The fonts used for heading  numbers  and  titles  at  each  level  are
              configured  by  the  <b>HF</b> string.  The string <b>HP</b> likewise assigns a type size to each heading level.
              The vertical spacing used by headings may be controlled by the user-definable macros <b>HX</b> and/or <b>HZ</b>.

              <u>Heading</u> <u>number</u> <u>format.</u>  Registers named <b>H1</b> through <b>H14</b> store  counters  for  each  heading  level.
              Their  values  are  printed  using  Arabic  numerals  by  default; see <b>HM</b>.  The heading levels are
              catenated with dots for formatting; to typeset only the deepest, set  the  <b>Ht</b>  register.   Heading
              numbers are not suffixed with a trailing dot except when only the first level is output; to omit a
              dot in this case as well, clear the <b>H1dot</b> register.

              <u>Customizing</u>  <u>heading</u>  <u>behavior.</u>  <u>mm</u> calls <u>hook</u> macros to enable further customization of headings.
              (DWB <u>mm</u> called these “exits”.)  They can be used  to  change  the  heading's  <u>mark</u>  (the  numbered
              portion  before any heading title), its vertical spacing, and its vertical space requirements (for
              instance, to require a minimum quantity of  subsequent  output  lines).   Define  hook  macros  in
              expectation  of the following parameters.  The argument <u>declared-level</u> is the <u>level</u> argument to <b>H</b>,
              or <b>0</b> for unnumbered headings (see <b>HU</b>).  <u>actual-level</u> is the same as  <u>declared-level</u>  for  numbered
              headings,  and  the  value  of  register  <b>Hu</b>  for unnumbered headings.  <u>title</u> is the corresponding
              argument to <b>H</b> or <b>HU</b>.

              <b>HX</b> <u>declared-level</u> <u>actual-level</u> <u>title</u>
                     <u>mm</u> calls <b>HX</b> before setting the heading.  Your definition may alter <b>}0</b>, <b>}2</b>, and <b>;3</b>.

                     <b>}0</b> (string)
                            contains the heading mark  plus  two  spaces  if  <u>declared-level</u>  is  non-zero,  and
                            otherwise is empty.

                     <b>;0</b> (register)
                            encodes  a  position for the text after the heading.  0 means that the heading is to
                            be run in, 1 means that a break is to occur  before  the  text,  and  2  means  that
                            vertical space is to separate heading and text.

                     <b>}2</b> (string)
                            is the suffix that separates a run-in heading from the text.  It contains two spaces
                            if register <b>;0</b> is 0, and otherwise is empty.

                     <b>;3</b> (register)
                            contains  the vertical space required for the heading to be typeset.  If that amount
                            is not available, the page is broken prior to the heading.  The default is <b>2v</b>.

              <b>HY</b> <u>declared-level</u> <u>actual-level</u> <u>title</u>
                     <u>mm</u> calls <b>HY</b> after determing the heading typeface and size.  It  could  be  used  to  change
                     indentation.

              <b>HZ</b> <u>declared-level</u> <u>actual-level</u> <u>title</u>
                     <u>mm</u> calls <b>HZ</b> after formatting the heading, just before <b>H</b> or <b>HU</b> returns.  It could be used to
                     change the page header to include a section heading.

       <b>HC</b> [<u>hyphenation-character</u>]
              Set  hyphenation  character.   Default  value  is  “\%”.   Resets to the default if called without
              argument.  Hyphenation can be turned off by setting register <b>Hy</b> to 0 at the beginning of the file.

       <b>HM</b> [<u>arg1</u> [<u>arg2</u> [... [<u>arg14</u>]]]]
              Set the heading mark style.  Each argument assigns the specified register format  (see  above)  to
              the  corresponding  heading level.  The default is <b>1</b> for all levels.  An explicitly empty argument
              also indicates the default.

       <b>HU</b> <u>heading-text</u>
              Set an unnumbered section heading.  Except for a heading number,  it  is  treated  as  a  numbered
              heading of the level stored in register <b>Hu</b>; see <b>H</b>.

       <b>I</b> [<u>italic-text</u> [<u>previous-font-text</u>]] ...
              Join  <u>italic-text</u>  in  italics with <u>previous-font-text</u> in the previous font, without space between
              the arguments.  If no arguments, switch font to italic style.

       <b>IA</b> [<u>recipient-name</u> [<u>title</u>]]
              Specify the inside address in a letter.  Input is collected into the inside address  until  <b>IE</b>  is
              called,  and  then  output.   You can specify multiple recipients with empty <b>IA</b>/<b>IE</b> pairs; only the
              last address is used.  The arguments give each recipient a name and title.  See <b>LT</b>.

       <b>IB</b> [<u>italic-text</u> [<u>bold-text</u>]] ...
              Join <u>italic-text</u> in italics with <u>bold-text</u> in boldface, without space between the arguments.

       <b>IE</b>     End the inside address begun with <b>IA</b>.

       <b>IND</b> <u>argument</u> ...
              If the Boolean register <b>Ref</b> is true, write an index entry as a specially prepared <u>roff</u> comment  to
              the  standard  error stream, with each <u>argument</u> separated from its predecessor by a tab character.
              The entry's location information is arranged as configured by the most recent <b>INITI</b> call.

       <b>INDP</b>   Output the index set up by <b>INITI</b> and populated by <b>IND</b> calls.  By default, <b>INDP</b> calls <b>SK</b> and writes
              a centered caption interpolating the string  <b>Index</b>.   It  then  disables  filling  and  calls  <b>2C</b>;
              afterward, it restores filling and calls <b>1C</b>.

              Define  macros  to customize this behavior.  <b>INDP</b> calls <b>TXIND</b> before the caption, <b>TYIND</b> <u>instead</u> of
              writing the caption, and <b>TZIND</b> after formatting the index.

       <b>INITI</b> <u>location-type</u> <u>file-name</u> [<u>macro</u>]
              Initialize <u>groff</u> <u>mm</u>'s indexing system.  Argument <u>location-type</u> selects how the  location  of  each
              index entry is reported.  <u>file-name</u> populates an internal string used later by <b>INDP</b>.

              <u><b>location-type</b></u>   <b>Entry</b> <b>format</b>
              N               page number
              H               heading mark
              B               page number, tab character, heading mark

              If <u>macro</u> is specified, it is called for each index entry with the arguments given to <b>IND</b>.

       <b>INITR</b> <u>id</u>
              Initialize the cross reference macros.  Cross references are written to the standard error stream,
              which  should  be  redirected  into  a  file  named  id<u>.qrf</u>.   <u><a href="../man1/mmroff.1.html">mmroff</a></u>(1)  handles this and the two
              formatting passes it requires.  The first pass identifies cross references,  and  the  second  one
              includes them.

              See <b>SETR</b>, <b>GETPN</b>, and <b>GETHN</b>.

       <b>IR</b> [<u>italic-text</u> [<u>roman-text</u>]] ...
              Join <u>italic-text</u> in italics with <u>roman-text</u> in roman style, without space between the arguments.

       <b>ISODATE</b> [<b>0</b>]
              Use ISO 8601 format for the date string <b>DT</b> used by some cover sheet and memorandum types; that is,
              <u>YYYY</u>-<u>MM</u>-<u>DD</u>.  Must be called before <b>ND</b> to be effective.  If given an argument of <b>0,</b> the traditional
              date format for the <u>groff</u> locale is used; this is also the default.

       <b>LB</b> <u>text-indent</u> <u>mark-indent</u> <u>pad</u> <u>type</u> [<u>mark</u> [<u>pre-item-space</u> [<u>pre-list-space</u>]]]
              Begin  list.  The macros <b>AL</b>, <b>BL</b>, <b>BVL</b>, <b>DL</b>, <b>ML</b>, <b>RL</b>, and <b>VL</b> call <b>LB</b> in various ways; they are simpler
              to use and may be preferred if they suit the desired purpose.

              The nesting level of lists is tracked by <u>mm;</u> the outermost level is 0.  The text of each list item
              is indented by <u>text-indent;</u> the default is taken from the <b>Li</b> register (in ens).  Each item's  mark
              is  indented  by  <u>mark-indent;</u>  the  default is <b>0n</b>.  The mark is normally left-aligned.  If <u>pad</u> is
              greater than zero, <u>mark-indent</u> is overridden such that <u>pad</u> ens of space  follow  the  mark.   <u>type</u>
              selects one of six possible ways to display the mark.

              <u><b>type</b></u>   <b>Output</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> <b>“x”</b>
              1      x.
              2      x)
              3      (x)
              4      [x]
              5      &lt;x&gt;
              6      {x}

              If <u>type</u> is 0 and <u>mark</u> is unspecified, the items are set with a hanging indent.  Otherwise, <u>mark</u> is
              interpreted  as a string defining the mark.  If <u>type</u> is greater than zero, items are automatically
              numbered; <u>mark</u> is interpreted as a register format.  The default <u>type</u> is <b>0</b>.

              The last two arguments manage vertical space.  Unless a list's nesting level is greater  than  the
              value of register <b>Ls</b>, its items are preceded by <u>pre-item-space</u> multiplied by the register <b>Lsp</b>; the
              default  is <b>1</b>.  <b>LB</b> precedes the list by <u>pre-list-space</u> multiplied by the register <b>Lsp</b>; the default
              is <b>0</b>.

       <b>LC</b> [<u>list-level</u>]
              Clear list state.  Active lists are terminated as if with <b>LE</b>, either all  (the  default)  or  only
              those from the current level down to <u>list-level</u> if specified.  <b>H</b> calls <b>LC</b> automatically.

       <b>LE</b> [<b>1</b>] End  list.   The current list is terminated.  An argument of <b>1</b> causes vertical space in the amount
              of register <b>Lsp</b> to follow the list.

       <b>LI</b> [<u>mark</u> [<u>item-mark-mode</u>]]
              Begin a list item.  Input is collected into a list item until the current list is terminated or <b>LI</b>
              is called again.  By default, the item's text is preceded by any mark configured  by  the  current
              list.   If  only  <u>mark</u>  is specified, it replaces the configured mark.  A second argument prefixes
              <u>mark</u> to the configured mark; an <u>item-mark-mode</u> value of 1 places an unbreakable space after  <u>mark,</u>
              while a value of 2 does not (rendering the two adjacent).  Also see register <b>Limsp</b>.

       <b>LO</b> <u>option</u> [<u>value</u>]
              Specify  letter  options;  see  <b>LT</b>.  Standard options are as follows.  See <b>IA</b> regarding the inside
              address and string <b>DT</b> regarding the date.

              <u><b>option</b></u>   <b>Effect</b>
              AT       Attention; put contents of string <b>LetAT</b> and <u>value</u> left-aligned after the inside address.
              CN       Confidential; put <u>value,</u> or contents of string <b>LetCN</b>, left-aligned after the date.
              RN       Reference; put contents of string <b>LetRN</b> and <u>value</u> after the confidental notation (if any)
                       and the date, aligned with the latter.
              SA       Salutation; put <u>value,</u> or contents of string <b>LetSA</b>, left-aligned after the inside address
                       and the confidental notation (if any).
              SJ       Subject; put contents of string <b>LetSJ</b> and <u>value</u> left-aligned after the inside address and
                       the attention and salutation notations (if any).  In letter type “SP”, <b>LetSJ</b>  is  ignored
                       and <u>value</u> is set in full capitals.

       <b>LT</b> [<u>style</u>]
              Format  a  letter in the designated <u>style,</u> defaulting to <b>BL</b> (see below).  A letter begins with the
              writer's address (<b>WA</b>/<b>WE</b>), followed by the date (<b>ND</b>), the inside address (<b>IA</b>/<b>IE</b>), the body  of  the
              letter  (<b>P</b>  and other general-purpose <u>mm</u> macros), the formal closing (<b>FC</b>), the signature (<b>SG</b>), and
              notations (<b>NS</b>/<b>NE</b>).  Any of these may be omitted.  Letter options specified  with  <b>LO</b>  add  further
              annotations, which are extensible; see section “Internals” below.

              <u><b>style</b></u>   <b>Description</b>
              <b>BL</b>      Blocked:  the  writer's  address,  date, formal closing, and signature are indented to the
                      center of the line.  Everything else is left-aligned.
              <b>SB</b>      Semi-blocked: as <b>BL</b>, but the first line of each paragraph is indented by <b>5m</b>.
              <b>FB</b>      Fully blocked: everything begins at the left margin.
              <b>SP</b>      Simplified: as <b>FB</b>, but a formal closing is omitted, and  the  signature  is  set  in  full
                      capitals.

       <b>MC</b> <u>column-width</u> [<u>gutter-width</u>]
              Begin  multi-column  layout.   <u>groff</u> <u>mm</u> creates as many columns of <u>column-width</u> as the line length
              will permit.  <u>gutter-width</u> is the interior  spacing  between  columns.   It  defaults  to  <u>column-</u>
              <u>width</u>/15.   <b>1C</b>  returns  to  single-column  layout.   <b>MC</b>  is  a  GNU  extension.   See <b>MULB</b> for an
              alternative.

       <b>ML</b> <u>mark</u> [<u>text-indent</u> [<b>1</b>]]
              Start a list with the <u>mark</u> argument preceding each list item.  <u>text-indent</u> overrides  the  default
              indentation  of  the  list  items  set  by register <b>Li</b>.  If a third argument, conventionally <b>1</b>, is
              given, the blank line that normally precedes each list item is suppressed.  Use <b>LI</b> to declare list
              items, and <b>LE</b> to end the list.

       <b>MT</b> [<u>type</u> [<u>addressee</u>]]
              Select memorandum type.  These correspond to formats used by AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, where the  <u>mm</u>
              package  was  initially  developed, affecting the document layout.  Some of these included a cover
              page with a caption categorizing the document.  <u>groff</u> <u>mm</u> uses <u>type</u>  to  construct  the  file  name
              <u>/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mm/</u>type<u>.MT</u> and load it with the <b>mso</b> request.  Memorandum types 0 to 5
              are  supported;  any  other  value of <u>type</u> is mapped to type 6.  If <u>type</u> is omitted, <b>0</b> is implied.
              <u>addressee</u> sets a string analogous to one used by AT&amp;T cover sheet macros that are not  implemented
              in <u>groff</u> <u>mm</u>.

              <u><b>type</b></u>   <b>Description</b>
              0      normal memorandum; no caption
              1      captioned “MEMORANDUM FOR FILE”
              2      captioned “PROGRAMMER'S NOTES”
              3      captioned “ENGINEER'S NOTES”
              4      released paper
              5      external letter

              See <b>COVER</b> for a more flexible cover sheet mechanism.

       <b>MOVE</b> <u>y-pos</u> [<u>x-pos</u> [<u>line-length</u>]]
              Move  to  a  position,  setting page offset to <u>x-pos</u>.  If <u>line-length</u> is not given, the difference
              between current and new page offset is used.  Use <b>PGFORM</b> without arguments to return to normal.

       <b>MULB</b> <u>cw1</u> <u>space1</u> [<u>cw2</u> <u>space2</u>] ... <u>cwn</u>
              Begin alternative multi-column mode.  All column widths must be specified, as must the  amount  of
              space  between each column pair.  The arguments' default scaling unit is <b>n</b>.  <b>MULB</b> uses a diversion
              and operates in a separate environment.

       <b>MULN</b>   Begin next column in alternative column mode.

       <b>MULE</b>   End alternative multi-column mode and emit the columns.

       <b>NCOL</b>   Move to the start of the next column (only when using <b>2C</b> or <b>MC</b>).  Contrast with <b>MULN</b>.

       <b>ND</b> [<u>arg</u>]
              Set the document's date.  <u>mm</u> does not interpret <u>arg</u>; it can be a revision identifier (or empty).

       <b>NE</b>     End notation begun with <b>NS</b>; filling is enabled.

       <b>nP</b> [<u>type</u>]
              Begin a numbered paragraph at heading level two.  See <b>P</b>.

       <b>NS</b> [<u>code</u> [<b>1</b>]]
              Declare notations, typically for letters or memoranda, of the type specified by  <u>code</u>.   The  text
              corresponding to <u>code</u> is output, and filling is disabled until <b>NE</b> is called.  Typically, a list of
              names  or  attachments  lies  within <b>NS</b>/<b>NE</b>.  If <u>code</u> is absent or does not match one of the values
              listed under the <b>Letns</b> string description below, each line of  notations  is  formatted  as  “Copy
              (<u>line</u>)  to”.   If  a second argument, conventionally <b>1</b>, is given, <u>code</u> becomes the entire notation
              and <b>NE</b> is not necessary.  In <u>groff</u> <u>mm</u>, you can set up further notations to be  recognized  by  <b>NS</b>;
              see the strings <b>Letns</b> and <b>Letnsdef</b> below.

       <b>OF</b> [<b>"'</b><u>left</u><b>'</b><u>center</u><b>'</b><u>right</u><b>'"</b>]
              Define  the  odd-page footer, which is formatted just above the normal page footer on odd-numbered
              pages.  See <b>PF</b>.  <b>OF</b> defines the string <b>EOPof</b>.

       <b>OH</b> [<b>"'</b><u>left</u><b>'</b><u>center</u><b>'</b><u>right</u><b>'"</b>]
              Define the odd-page header, which is formatted just below the normal page header  on  odd-numbered
              pages.  See <b>PH</b>.  <b>OH</b> defines the string <b>TPoh</b>.

       <b>OP</b>     Make  sure that the following text is printed at the top of an odd-numbered page.  Does not output
              an empty page if currently at the top of an odd page.

       <b>P</b> [<u>type</u>]
              Begin new paragraph.  If <u>type</u> is missing or  0, <b>P</b> sets the paragraph fully left-aligned.   A  <u>type</u>
              of  1  idents  the  first  line  by  <b>\[Pi]</b> ens.  Set the register <b>Pt</b> to select a default paragraph
              indentation style.  The register <b>Ps</b> controls the vertical spacing between paragraphs.

       <b>PE</b>     Picture end; see <u><a href="../man1/pic.1.html">pic</a></u>(1).

       <b>PF</b> [<b>"'</b><u>left</u><b>'</b><u>center</u><b>'</b><u>right</u><b>'"</b>]
              Define the page footer.  The footer is formatted at the bottom  of  each  page;  the  argument  is
              otherwise as described in <b>PH</b>.  <b>PF</b> defines the string <b>EOPf</b>.  See <b>EF</b>, <b>OF</b>, and <b>EOP</b>.

       <b>PGFORM</b> [<u>linelength</u> [<u>pagelength</u> [<u>pageoffset</u> [<b>1</b>]]]]
              Set  line  length,  page  length,  and/or page offset.  This macro can be used for letterheads and
              similar.  It is normally the first macro call in a file, though it is not necessary.   <b>PGFORM</b>  can
              be  used without arguments to reset everything after a <b>MOVE</b> call.  A line break is done unless the
              fourth argument is given.  This can be used to avoid the page  number  on  the  first  page  while
              setting  new  width  and length.  (It seems as if this macro sometimes doesn't work too well.  Use
              the command-line arguments to change line length, page length, and page offset instead.)

       <b>PGNH</b>   Suppress header on the next page.  This macro must be called before any macros that produce output
              to affect the layout of the first page.

       <b>PH</b> [<b>"'</b><u>left</u><b>'</b><u>center</u><b>'</b><u>right</u><b>'"</b>]
              Define the page header, formatted at the top of each page, as the argument,  where  <u>left</u>,  <u>center</u>,
              and <u>right</u> are aligned to the respective locations on the line.  A “<b>%</b>” character in <u>arg</u> is replaced
              by the page number.  If the argument is absent, no page header is set.  The default page header is
                     "''- % -''"
              which  centers  the  page  number between hyphens and formats nothing at the upper left and right.
              Header macros call <b>PX</b> (if defined) after formatting the header.  <b>PH</b> defines the string  <b>TPh</b>.   See
              <b>EH</b>, <b>OH</b>, and <b>TP</b>.

       <b>PIC</b> [<b>-B</b>] [<b>-C</b>|<b>-I</b> <u>n</u>|<b>-L</b>|<b>-R</b>] <u>file</u> [<u>width</u> [<u>height</u>]]
              Include  PostScript  document <u>file</u>.  The optional <b>-B</b> argument draws a box around the picture.  The
              optional <b>-L</b>, <b>-C</b>, <b>-R</b>, and <b>-I</b> <u>n</u> arguments align the picture or indent it by <u>n</u>  (assuming  a  scaling
              unit  of <b>m</b>).  By default, the picture is left-aligned.  Optional <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> arguments resize
              the picture.  Use of this macro requires two-pass processing; see <b>INITR</b> and <u><a href="../man1/mmroff.1.html">mmroff</a></u>(1).

       <b>PS</b>     Picture start; see <u><a href="../man1/pic.1.html">pic</a></u>(1).

       <b>PY</b>     Picture end with flyback.  Ends a <u><a href="../man1/pic.1.html">pic</a></u>(1) picture, returning the vertical position to where it  was
              prior to the picture.  This is a GNU extension.

       <b>R</b> [<u>roman-text</u> [<u>previous-font-text</u>]] ...
              Join <u>roman-text</u> in roman style with <u>previous-font-text</u> in the previous font, without space between
              the arguments.  If no arguments, switch font to roman style.

       <b>RB</b> [<u>roman-text</u> [<u>bold-text</u>]] ...
              Join <u>roman-text</u> in roman style with <u>bold-text</u> in boldface, without space between the arguments.

       <b>RD</b> [<u>prompt</u> [<u>diversion</u> [<u>string</u>]]]
              Read  from  standard  input  to  diversion  and/or string.  The text is saved in a diversion named
              <u>diversion</u>.  Recall the text by writing the name of the diversion after a dot on an empty line.   A
              string is also defined if <u>string</u> is given.  <u>Diversion</u> and/or <u>prompt</u> can be empty ("").

       <b>RF</b>     Reference end.  Ends a reference definition and returns to normal processing.  See <b>RS</b>.

       <b>RI</b> [<u>roman-text</u> [<u>italic-text</u>]] ...
              Join <u>roman-text</u> in roman style with <u>italic-text</u> in italics, without space between the arguments.

       <b>RL</b> [<u>text-indent</u> [<b>1</b>]]
              Begin reference list.  Each item is preceded by an automatically incremented number between square
              brackets; compare <b>AL</b>.  <u>text-indent</u> changes the default indentation.  Use <b>LI</b> to declare list items,
              and  <b>LE</b>  to  end  the  list.   A second argument, conventionally <b>1</b>, suppresses the blank line that
              normally precedes each list item.

       <b>RP</b> [<u>suppress-counter-reset</u> [<u>page-ejection-policy</u>]]
              Format a reference page, listing items accumulated within <b>RS</b>/<b>RF</b> pairs.  The reference  counter  is
              reset unless the first argument is <b>1</b>.  Normally, page breaks occur before and after the references
              are  output; the register <b>Rpe</b> configures this behavior, and a second argument overrides its value.
              <b>TC</b> calls <b>RP</b> automatically if references have accumulated.

              References are list items, and thus are vertically separated (see <b>LB</b>).  Setting register <b>Ls</b>  to  <b>0</b>
              suppresses this spacing.  The string <b>Rp</b> contains the reference page caption.

       <b>RS</b> [<u>reference-string</u>]
              Begin  an  automatically  numbered  reference  definition.   By  default,  references are numbered
              starting at 1; the number is available in register  <b>:R</b>.   Interpolate  the  string  <b>Rf</b>  where  the
              reference  mark  should  be  and  write  the  reference  between  <b>RS</b>/<b>RF</b> on an input line after the
              reference mark.  If <u>reference-string</u> is specified, <u>groff</u> <u>ms</u> also stores the reference  mark  in  a
              string of that name, which can be interpolated as <b>\*[</b><u>reference-string</u><b>]</b> subsequently.

       <b>S</b> [<u>type-size</u> [<u>vertical-spacing</u>]]
              Set  type  size  and vertical spacing.  Each argument is a <u>groff</u> measurement, using an appropriate
              scaling unit and an optional <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> prefix to  increment  or  decrement  the  current  value.   An
              argument  of  <b>P</b>  restores  the  previous  value, <b>C</b> indicates the current value, and <b>D</b> requests the
              default.  An empty or omitted argument is treated as <b>P</b>.

       <b>SA</b> [<u>mode</u>]
              Set or restore the default enablement of adjustment.  Specify <b>0</b> or <b>1</b> as <u>mode</u> to set  a  document's
              default  explicitly;  <b>1</b>  is  assumed  by  <u>mm</u>.  Adjustment can be temporarily suspended with the <b>na</b>
              request.  When the <b>H</b> or <b>HU</b> macros are used to format a heading, or when <b>SA</b>  is  called  without  a
              <u>mode</u> argument, the default adjustment is restored.

       <b>SETR</b> <u>refname</u> [<u>string</u>]
              Remember  the  current  heading  and  page numbers as <u>refname</u>.  Saves <u>string</u> if <u>string</u> is defined.
              <u>string</u> is retrieved with <b>GETST</b>.  See <b>INITR</b>.

       <b>SG</b> [<u>arg</u> [<b>1</b>]]
              Signature line.  Prints the authors name(s) after the formal closing.  The argument is appended to
              the reference data, printed at either the first  or  last  author.   The  reference  data  is  the
              location,  department,  and  initials specified with <b>AU</b>.  It is printed at the first author if the
              second argument is given, otherwise at the last.  No reference data is printed if the author(s) is
              specified through <b>WA</b>/<b>WE</b>.  See section “Internals” below.

       <b>SK</b> [<u>n</u>] Skip <u>n</u> pages.  If <u>n</u> is 0 or omitted, the page is broken unless the drawing position is already  at
              the top of a page.  Otherwise, <u>n</u> pages, blank except for any headers and footers, are printed.

       <b>SM</b> <u>text</u> [<u>post</u>]
       <b>SM</b> <u>pre</u> <u>text</u> <u>post</u>
              Format <u>text</u> at a smaller type size, joined with any specified <u>pre</u> and <u>post</u> at normal size.

       <b>SP</b> [<u>lines</u>]
              Space  vertically.   <u>lines</u>  can have any scaling factor, like “3i” or “8v”.  Several <b>SP</b> calls in a
              line only produces the maximum number of lines, not the sum.  <b>SP</b> is ignored also until  the  first
              text line in a page.  Add <b>\&amp;</b> before a call to <b>SP</b> to avoid this.

       <b>TAB</b>    Reset tab stops to every 5 ens.

       <b>TB</b> [<u>title</u> [<u>override</u> [<u>flag</u> [<u>refname</u>]]]]
              Caption  a table.  Arguments are handled analogously to <b>EC</b>.  The register <b>Tb</b> is the table counter.
              The string <b>Litb</b> precedes the table number and any <u>title.</u>  Table captions are centered irrespective
              of the alignment of any enclosing display.

              Captioned tables are listed in a table of contents (see <b>TC</b>) if the Boolean register  <b>Lt</b>  is  true.
              Such a list uses the string <b>Lt</b> as a heading.

       <b>TC</b> [<u>slevel</u> [<u>spacing</u> [<u>tlevel</u> [<u>tab</u> [<u>h1</u> [<u>h2</u> [<u>h3</u> [<u>h4</u> [<u>h5</u>]]]]]]]]]
              Output table of contents.  This macro is normally the last called in the document.  It flushes any
              pending displays and, if any references are pending (see <b>RS</b>), calls <b>RP</b>.  It then begins a new page
              with  the  contents  caption, stored in the string <b>Licon</b>, centered at the top.  The entries follow
              after three vees of space.  Each entry is a saved section (number and) heading title (see  the  <b>Cl</b>
              register),  along  with its associated page number.  By default, an entry is indented by an amount
              corresponding to its heading level and the maximum heading  length  encountered  at  that  heading
              level;  if  defined,  the string <b>Ci</b> overrides these indentations.  Entries at heading levels up to
              and including <u>slevel</u> are preceded by <u>spacing</u> vees of space.  Entries at heading levels up  to  and
              including  <u>tlevel</u> are followed by a leader and a right-aligned page number.  If the Boolean-valued
              <u>tab</u> argument is true, the leader is replaced with horizontal  motion  in  the  same  amount.   For
              entries  above  heading level <u>tlevel</u>, the page number follows the heading text after a word space.
              Each argument <u>h1</u>...<u>h5</u> appears in order on its own line,  centered,  above  the  contents  caption.
              Page  numbering  restarts  at 1, in register format “i”.  If the <b>Oc</b> register is true, numbering of
              these pages is suppressed.

              If <b>TC</b> is called with at most four arguments, it calls the user-defined macro <b>TX</b> (if defined) prior
              to formatting the contents caption, and  <b>TY</b>  (if  defined)  <u>instead</u>  of  formatting  the  contents
              caption.

              Analogous  handling  of  lists of figures, tables, equations, and exhibits is achieved by defining
              <b>TX</b><u>xx</u> and <b>TY</b><u>xx</u> macros, where <u>xx</u> is “FG”, “TB”, “EC”, or “EX”, respectively.  Similarly, the strings
              <b>Lifg</b>, <b>Litb</b>, <b>Liex</b>, and <b>Liec</b> determine captions for their respective lists.

       <b>TE</b>     Table end.  See <b>TS</b>.

       <b>TH</b>     End table heading.  It is repeated after page breaks within a table.   See  <b>TS</b>.   The  <b>N</b>  argument
              supported by DWB <u>mm</u> is not implemented by <u>groff</u> <u>mm.</u>

       <b>TL</b> [<u>charging-case-number</u> [<u>filing-case-number</u>]]
              Begin  document  title.  Input is collected into the title until <b>AF</b> or <b>AU</b> is called, and output as
              directed by the cover page.  <u>charging-case-number</u> and <u>filing-case-number</u>  are  saved  for  use  in
              memorandum types 0 and 5.  See <b>MT</b>.

       <b>TM</b> <u>number</u> ...
              Declare technical memorandum number(s) used by <b>MT</b>.

       <b>TP</b>     If  defined,  this  macro is called in lieu of normal page header layout.  Headers and footers are
              formatted in a separate environment.  See <b>EOP</b>.

              <b>Strings</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>TP</b>

              <b>TPoh</b>    argument to <b>OH</b>

       <b>TS</b> [<b>H</b>] Table start.  Argument “H” tells <u>mm</u> that the table has a heading.  See <b>TE</b>, <b>TH</b>, and <u><a href="../man1/tbl.1.html">tbl</a></u>(1).

       <b>VERBON</b> [<u>format</u> [<u>type-size</u> [<u>font</u>]]]
              Begin verbatim display, where characters have equal width.  <u>format</u>  controls  several  parameters.
              Add  up  the  values  of  desired  features;  the  default  is <b>0</b>.  On typesetting devices, further
              arguments configure the <u>type-size</u> in scaled points,  and  the  face  (<u>font</u>);  the  default  is  <b>CR</b>
              (Courier roman).

              <b>Value</b>   <b>Effect</b>
              1       Disable the formatter's escape character (\).
              2       Vertically space before the display.
              4       Vertically space after the display.
              8       Number output lines; call formatter's <b>nm</b> request with arguments in string <b>Verbnm</b>.
              16      Indent by the amount stored in register <b>Verbin</b>.

       <b>VERBOFF</b>
              End verbatim display.

       <b>VL</b> [<u>text-indent</u> [<u>mark-indent</u> [<b>1</b>]]]
              Begin  variable-item  (or  “tagged”)  list.  Each item should supply its own mark, or tag.  If the
              mark is wider than <u>mark-indent,</u> one space separates it from subsequent text; contrast <b>BVL</b>.   <u>text-</u>
              <u>indent</u>  sets  the  indentation  of  the  text,  and <u>mark-indent</u> the distance from the current list
              indentation to the mark.  A third argument suppresses the blank line that normally  precedes  each
              list item.  Use <b>LI</b> to declare list items, and <b>LE</b> to end the list.

       <b>VM</b> [<b>-T</b>] [<u>top</u> [<u>bottom</u>]]
              Vertical  margin.   Increase the top and bottom margin by <u>top</u> and <u>bottom</u>, respectively.  If option
              <b>-T</b> is specified, set those margins to <u>top</u> and <u>bottom</u>.  If no argument is given, reset  the  margin
              to  zero,  or  to  the  default  (“7v 5v”) if <b>-T</b> is used.  It is highly recommended that macros <b>TP</b>
              and/or <b>EOP</b> are defined if using <b>-T</b> and setting top and/or bottom margin to less than the  default.
              This undocumented DWB <u>mm</u> macro is exposed by <u>groff</u> <u>mm</u> to increase user control of page layout.

       <b>WA</b> [<u>writer's-name</u> [<u>title</u>]]
              Specify  the  writer(s) of an <b>LT</b> letter.  Input is collected into the writer's address until <b>WA</b> is
              called, and then output.  You can specify multiple writers with empty <b>WA</b>/<b>WE</b> pairs; only  the  last
              address is used.  The arguments give each writer a name and title.

       <b>WC</b> [<u>format</u> ...]
              Control width of footnotes and displays.

              <u><b>format</b></u>   <b>Effect</b>
              <b>N</b>        equivalent to “<b>-WF</b> <b>-FF</b> <b>-WD</b>” (default)
              <b>WF</b>       set footnotes at full line length, even in two-column mode
              <b>-WF</b>      set footnotes using column line length
              <b>FF</b>       apply width of first footnote to encountered to subsequent ones
              <b>-FF</b>      footnote width determined by <b>WF</b> and <b>-WF</b>
              <b>WD</b>       set displays at full line length, even in two-column mode
              <b>-WD</b>      set displays using column line length

       <b>WE</b>     End the writer's address begun with <b>WA</b>.

</pre><h4><b>Strings</b></h4><pre>
       Many <u>mm</u> strings interpolate predefined, localizable text.  These are presented in quotation marks.

       <b>App</b>    “APPENDIX”

       <b>Apptxt</b> stores the <u>title</u> argument to the last <b>APP</b> call.

       <b>BU</b>     interpolates a bullet (see <b>BL</b>).

       <b>Ci</b>     is  a  list  of  indentation amounts to use for table of contents heading levels, overriding their
              automatic computation.  Each word must be a horizontal measurement (like “<b>1i</b>”) and is mapped  one-
              to-one to heading levels 1, 2, and so on.

       <b>DT</b>     The date; set by the <b>ND</b> macro (defaults to the date the document is formatted).  The format is the
              conventional one for the <u>groff</u> locale, but see the <b>ISODATE</b> macro and <b>Iso</b> register.

       <b>EM</b>     interpolates an em dash.

       <b>F</b>      interpolates  an  automatically  numbered  footnote marker; the number is used by the next <b>FS</b> call
              without an argument.  In <u>troff</u> mode, the marker is superscripted; in <u>nroff</u> mode, it is  surrounded
              by square brackets.

       <b>H1txt</b>  Updated by <b>.H</b> and <b>.HU</b> to the current heading text.  Also updated in table of contents &amp; friends.

       <b>HF</b>     assigns  font  identifiers,  separated  by spaces, to heading levels in one-to-one correspondence.
              Each identifier may be a font mounting position, font name, or style  name.   Omitted  values  are
              assumed  to  be  1.   The  default  is “<b>2</b> <b>2</b> <b>2</b> <b>2</b> <b>2</b> <b>2</b> <b>2</b> <b>2</b> <b>2</b> <b>2</b> <b>2</b> <b>2</b> <b>2</b> <b>2</b>”, which places all headings in
              italics.  DWB <u>mm</u>'s default was “<b>3</b> <b>3</b> <b>2</b> <b>2</b> <b>2</b> <b>2</b> <b>2</b>”.

       <b>HP</b>     assigns type sizes, separated by spaces, to heading levels  in  one-to-one  correspondence.   Each
              size  is  interpreted  in  scaled  points;  zero  values are translated to <b>10</b>.  Omitted values are
              assumed to be 0 (and are translated accordingly).  The default is “<b>0</b> <b>0</b> <b>0</b> <b>0</b> <b>0</b> <b>0</b> <b>0</b> <b>0</b> <b>0</b> <b>0</b> <b>0</b> <b>0</b> <b>0</b> <b>0</b>”.

       <b>Rp</b>     “REFERENCES”

       <b>Sm</b>     interpolates ℠, the service mark sign.

       <b>Tcst</b>   interpolates  an  indicator  of  the  <b>TC</b> macro's processing status.  If <b>TC</b> is not operating, it is
              empty.  User-defined <b>TP</b> or <b>EOP</b> macros might condition page headers or footers on its contents.

       <b>Verbnm</b> supplies argument(s) to the <b>nm</b> request employed by the <b>VERBON</b> macro.  The default is “1”.

</pre><h4><b>Registers</b></h4><pre>
       Default register values, where meaningful, are shown in parentheses.  Many are also  marked  as  Boolean-
       valued,  meaning  that  they  are  considered  “true”  (on, enabled) when they have a positive value, and
       “false” (off, disabled) otherwise.

       <b>.mgm</b>   indicates that <u>groff</u> <u>mm</u> is in use (Boolean-valued; <b>1</b>).

       <b>:p</b>     is an auto-incrementing footnote counter; see <b>FS</b>.

       <b>:R</b>     is an auto-incrementing reference counter; see <b>RS</b>.

       <b>Aph</b>    formats an appendix heading (and title, if supplied); see <b>APP</b> (Boolean-valued; <b>1</b>).

       <b>Au</b>     includes supplemental author information (the third and subsequent arguments to <b>AU</b>) in  memorandum
              “from” information; see <b>COVER</b> and <b>MT</b> (Boolean-valued; <b>1</b>).

       <b>Cl</b>     sets  the  threshold  for  inclusion of headings in a table of contents.  Headings at levels above
              this value are excluded; see <b>H</b> and <b>TC</b> (<b>2</b>).  The <b>Cl</b> register controls whether a  heading  is  <u>saved</u>
              for  output  in  the  table  of  contents  at the time <b>H</b> or <b>HU</b> is called; if you change <b>Cl</b>'s value
              immediately prior to calling <b>TC</b>, you are unlikely to get the result you want.

       <b>Cp</b>     suppresses page breaks before lists of captioned equations, exhibits,  figures,  and  tables,  and
              before an index; see <b>EC</b>, <b>EX</b>, <b>FG</b>, <b>TB</b>, and <b>INDP</b> (Boolean-valued; <b>0</b>).

       <b>D</b>      produces  debugging  information  for  the  <u>mm</u> package on the standard error stream.  A value of 0
              outputs nothing;  1  reports  formatting  progress.   Higher  values  communicate  internal  state
              information of increasing verbosity (<b>0</b>).

       <b>De</b>     causes a page break after a floating display is output; see <b>DF</b> (Boolean-valued; <b>0</b>).

       <b>Df</b>     configures  the  behavior of <b>DF</b>.  The following values are recognized; 4 and 5 do not override the
              <b>De</b> register (<b>5</b>).

              <b>Value</b>   <b>Effect</b>
              0       Flush pending displays at the end of each section when section-page numbering  is  active,
                      otherwise at the end of the document.
              1       Flush  a pending display on the current page or column if there is enough space, otherwise
                      at the end of the document.
              2       Flush one pending display at the top of each page or column.
              3       Flush a pending display on the current page or column if there is enough space,  otherwise
                      at the top of the next.
              4       Flush as many pending displays as possible in a new page or column.
              5       Fill columns or pages with flushed displays until none remain.

       <b>Ds</b>     puts vertical space in the amount of register <b>Dsp</b> (if defined) or <b>Lsp</b> before and after each static
              display; see <b>DS</b> (Boolean-valued; <b>1</b>).

       <b>Dsp</b>    configures  the  amount  of  vertical  space  placed  before and after static displays; see <b>DS</b> and
              register <b>Ds</b> (<u>undefined</u>).

       <b>Ec</b>     is an auto-incrementing equation counter; see <b>EC</b>.

       <b>Ej</b>     sets the threshold for page breaks (ejection) prior to the format of headings.  Headings at levels
              above this value are set on the same page and column if possible; see <b>H</b> (<b>0</b>).

       <b>Eq</b>     aligns an equation label to the left of a display instead of the right (Boolean-valued; <b>0</b>).

       <b>Ex</b>     is an auto-incrementing exhibit counter; see <b>EX</b>.

       <b>Fg</b>     is an auto-incrementing figure counter; see <b>FG</b>.

       <b>Fs</b>     is multiplied by register <b>Lsp</b> to vertically separate footnotes; see <b>FS</b> (<b>1</b>).

       <b>H1</b>...<b>H14</b>
              are auto-incrementing counters corresponding to each heading level; see <b>H</b>.

       <b>H1dot</b>  appends a period to the number of a level one heading; see <b>H</b> (Boolean-valued; <b>1</b>).

       <b>H1h</b>    is a copy of A copy of register register <b>H1</b>, but it is incremented just before a page break.  This
              can be useful in user-defined macros; see <b>H</b> and <b>HX</b>.

       <b>Hb</b>     sets the threshold for breaking the line after formatting  a  heading.   Text  after  headings  at
              levels above this value are set on the same output line if possible; see <b>H</b> (<b>2</b>).

       <b>Hc</b>     sets  the  threshold  for  centering  a  heading.   Headings  at  levels  above this value use the
              prevailing alignment (that is, they are not centered); see <b>H</b> (<b>0</b>).

       <b>Hi</b>     configures the indentation of text after headings.  It does not  affect  “run-in”  headings.   The
              following values are recognized; see <b>H</b> and <b>P</b> (<b>1</b>).

              <b>Value</b>   <b>Effect</b>
              0       no indentation
              1       indent per the paragraph type
              2       indent to align with heading title

       <b>Hps</b>    sets  the heading level threshold for application of preceding vertical space; see <b>H</b>.  Headings at
              levels above the value in register <b>Hps</b> use the amount of space in register <b>Hps1</b>; otherwise that in
              <b>Hps2</b>.  The value of <b>Hps</b> should be strictly greater than that of <b>Ej</b> (<b>1</b>).

       <b>Hps1</b>   configures the amount of vertical space preceding a heading above the <b>Hps</b> threshold; see <b>H</b>  (<u>troff</u>
              devices: <b>0.5v</b>; <u>nroff</u> devices: <b>1v</b>).

       <b>Hps2</b>   configures  the  amount of vertical space preceding a heading at or below the <b>Hps</b> threshold; see <b>H</b>
              (<u>troff</u> devices: <b>1v</b>; <u>nroff</u> devices: <b>2v</b>).

       <b>Hs</b>     sets the heading level threshold for application of succeeding vertical  space.   If  the  heading
              level is greater than <b>Hs</b>, the heading is followed by vertical space in the amount of register <b>Hss</b>;
              see <b>H</b> (<b>2</b>).

       <b>Hss</b>    is  multiplied  by  register  <b>Lsp</b>  to produce vertical space after headings above the threshold in
              register <b>Hs</b>; see <b>H</b> (<b>1</b>).

       <b>Ht</b>     suppresses output of heading level counters above the lowest when the heading is formatted; see  <b>H</b>
              (Boolean-valued; <b>0</b>).

       <b>Hu</b>     sets the heading level used by unnumbered headings; see <b>HU</b> (<b>2</b>).

       <b>Hy</b>     enables automatic hyphenation of words (Boolean-valued; <b>0</b>).

       <b>Iso</b>    configures  the use of ISO 8601 date format if specified (with any value) on the command line; see
              <b>ISODATE</b>.  The default is determined by localization files.

       <b>L</b>      defines the page length for the document, and must be set from the command line.  A  scaling  unit
              should be appended.  The default is that of the selected <u>groff</u> output device.

       <b>Le</b>
       <b>Lf</b>
       <b>Lt</b>
       <b>Lx</b>     configure  the  report  of  lists  of equation, figure, table, and exhibit captions, respectively,
              after a table of contents; see <b>TC</b> (Boolean-valued; <b>Le</b>: <b>0</b>; <b>Lf</b>, <b>Lt</b>, <b>Lx</b>: <b>1</b>).

       <b>Letwam</b> sets the maximum number of input lines permitted in a writer's address; see <b>WA</b> and <b>WE</b> (<b>14</b>).

       <b>Li</b>     configures the amount of indentation in ens applied to list items; see <b>LI</b> (<b>6</b>).

       <b>Limsp</b>  inserts a space between the prefix and the mark in automatically numbered lists; see <b>AL</b>  (Boolean-
              valued; <b>1</b>).

       <b>Ls</b>     sets  a threshold for placement of vertical space before list items.  If the list nesting level is
              greater than this value, no such spacing occurs; see <b>LI</b> (<b>99</b>).

       <b>Lsp</b>    configures the base amount of vertical space used for separation in the document.  <u>mm</u> applies this
              spacing to many contexts, sometimes with multipliers; see <b>DS</b>, <b>FS</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>LI</b>,  and  <b>P</b>  (<u>troff</u>  devices:
              <b>0.5v</b>; <u>nroff</u> devices: <b>1v</b>).

       <b>N</b>      configures  the  header  and  footer  placements  used  by  <b>PH</b>.   The default footer is empty.  If
              “section-page” numbering is selected, the default header becomes  empty  and  the  default  footer
              becomes  “<u>x</u>-<u>y</u>”,  where  <u>x</u> is is the section number (the number of the current first-level heading)
              and <u>y</u> the page number within the section.  The following values are recognized; for finer control,
              see <b>PH</b>, <b>PF</b>, <b>EH</b>, <b>EF</b>, <b>OH</b>, and <b>OF</b>, and registers <b>Sectf</b> and <b>Sectp</b>.  Value 5 is a GNU extension (<b>0</b>).

              <b>Value</b>   <b>Effect</b>
              0       Set header on all pages.
              1       Move header to footer on page 1.
              2       Omit header on page 1.
              3       Use “section-page” numbering style on all pages.
              4       Omit header on all pages.
              5       Use “section-page” and “section-figure” numbering style on all pages.

       <b>Np</b>     causes paragraphs after first-level headings (only) to be numbered in the format <u>s</u>.<u>p</u>, where  <u>s</u>  is
              is  the  section  number  (the  number  of the current first-level heading) and <u>p</u> is the paragraph
              number, starting at 1; see <b>H</b> and <b>P</b> (Boolean-valued; <b>0</b>).

       <b>O</b>      defines the page offset of the document, and must be set from the command line.   A  scaling  unit
              should  be appended.  The default is <b>.75i</b> on terminal devices.  On typesetters, it is <b>.963i</b> or set
              to <b>1i</b> by the <u>papersize.tmac</u> package; see <u><a href="../man5/groff_tmac.5.html">groff_tmac</a></u>(5).

       <b>Oc</b>     suppresses the appearance of page numbers in the table of contents; see <b>TC</b> (Boolean-valued; <b>0</b>).

       <b>Of</b>     selects a separator format within equation, exhibit, figure, and table captions; see <b>EC</b>,  <b>EX</b>,  <b>FG</b>,
              and <b>TB</b>.  The following values are recognized; the spaces shown are unpaddable (<b>0</b>).

              <b>Value</b>   <b>Effect</b>
              0       ".  "
              1       " — "

       <b>P</b>      interpolates  the  current  page  number;  it is the same as register <b>%</b> except when “section-page”
              numbering is enabled.

       <b>Pi</b>     configures the amount of indentation in ens applied to the first line of a paragraph; see <b>P</b> (<b>5</b>).

       <b>Pgps</b>   causes the type size and vertical spacing set by <b>S</b> to apply to headers and footers, overriding the
              <b>HP</b> string.  If not set, <b>S</b> calls affect headers and footers only when followed by <b>PH</b>, <b>PF</b>,  <b>OH</b>,  <b>EH</b>,
              <b>OF</b>, or <b>OE</b> calls (Boolean-valued; <b>1</b>).

       <b>Ps</b>     is multiplied by register <b>Lsp</b> to vertically separate paragraphs; see <b>P</b> (<b>1</b>).

       <b>Pt</b>     determines when a first-line indentation is applied to a paragraph; see <b>P</b> (<b>0</b>).

              <b>Value</b>   <b>Effect</b>
              0       never
              1       always
              2       always, except immediately after <b>H</b>, <b>DE</b>, or <b>LE</b>

       <b>Ref</b>    is used internally to control <u><a href="../man1/mmroff.1.html">mmroff</a></u>(1)'s two-pass approach to index and reference management; see
              <b>INITI</b> and <b>RS</b> (Boolean-valued; <b>0</b>).

       <b>Rpe</b>    configures the default page ejection policy for reference pages; see <b>RP</b> (<b>0</b>).

              <b>Value</b>   <b>Effect</b>
              0       Break the page before and after the list of references.
              1       Suppress page break after the list.
              2       Suppress page break before the list.
              3       Suppress page breaks before and after the list.

       <b>S</b>      defines  the  type  size  for the document, and must be set from the command line.  A scaling unit
              should be appended; <b>p</b> is typical (<b>10p</b>).

       <b>Sectf</b>  selects the “section-figure” numbering style.  Its default is <b>0</b> unless register <b>N</b> is set to  <b>5</b>  at
              the command line (Boolean-valued).

       <b>Sectp</b>  selects  the  “section-page” numbering style.  Its default is <b>0</b> unless register <b>N</b> is set to <b>3</b> or <b>5</b>
              at the command line (Boolean-valued).

       <b>Si</b>     configures the amount of display indentation in ens; see <b>DS</b> (<b>5</b>).

       <b>Tb</b>     is an auto-incrementing table counter; see <b>TB</b>.

       <b>V</b>      defines the vertical spacing for the document, and must be set from the command line.   A  scaling
              unit should be appended; <b>p</b> is typical.  The default vertical spacing is 120% of the type size.

       <b>Verbin</b> configures  the  amount  of  indentation  for  verbatim displays when indentation is selected; see
              <b>VERBON</b> (<b>5n</b>).

       <b>W</b>      defines the “width” of the document (that is, the length of an output line with  no  indentation);
              it  must  be  set from the command line.  A scaling unit should be appended.  The default is <b>6i</b> or
              assigned by the <u>papersize.tmac</u> package; see <u><a href="../man5/groff_tmac.5.html">groff_tmac</a></u>(5).

       The <b>LT</b> letter macros call further macros depending on the letter type, with which they are suffixed.   It
       is  therefore possible to define additional letter types, either in the territory-specific macro file, or
       as local additions.  <b>LT</b> sets the registers <b>Pt</b> and <b>Pi</b> to 0 and 5, respectively.  The following macros must
       be defined to support a new letter type.

       <b>let@init_</b><u>type</u>
              <b>LT</b> calls this macro to initialize any registers and other data needed by the letter type.

       <b>let@head_</b><u>type</u>
              formats the letterhead; it is called instead of the  usual  page  header  macro.   Its  definition
              should remove the alias <b>let@header</b> unless the letterhead is desired on subsequent pages.

       <b>let@sg_</b><u>type</u> <u>name</u> <u>title</u> <u>n</u> <u>is-final</u> [<u>SG-arg</u> ...]
              <b>SG</b>  calls this macro only for letters; <b>MT</b> memoranda have their own signature processing.  <u>name</u> and
              <u>title</u> are specified through <b>WA</b>/<b>WE</b>.  <u>n</u> is the index of the <u>n</u>th writer, and <u>is-final</u> is true for the
              last writer to be listed.  Further <b>SG</b> arguments are appended to the signature line.

       <b>let@fc_</b><u>type</u> <u>closing</u>
              This macro is called by <b>FC</b>, and has the formal closing as the argument.

       <b>LO</b> implements letter options.  It requires that a string named <b>Let</b><u>type</u> be  defined,  where  <u>type</u>  is  the
       letter type.  <b>LO</b> then assigns its second argument (<u>value</u>) to the string <b>let*lo-</b><u>type</u>.

</pre><h4><b>Files</b></h4><pre>

       <u>/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mm/0.MT</u>
              implements memorandum types 0–3 and 6.

       <u>/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mm/4.MT</u>
              implements memorandum type 4.

       <u>/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mm/5.MT</u>
              implements memorandum type 5.

       <u>/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mm/locale</u>
              performs any (further) desired necessary localization; empty by default.
