</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The  GNU  implementation of the <u>man</u> macro package is part of the <u>groff</u> document formatting system.  It is
       used to produce manual pages (“man pages”) like the one you are reading.

       This document presents the macros thematically; for those needing only a quick reference,  the  following
       table lists them alphabetically, with cross references to appropriate subsections below.

       We discuss other macros (<b>.AT</b>, <b>.DT</b>, <b>.HP</b>, <b>.OP</b>, <b>.PD</b>, and <b>.UC</b>) in subsection “Deprecated features” below.

       Throughout  Unix  documentation,  a manual entry is referred to simply as a “man page”, regardless of its
       length, without gendered implication, and irrespective of the macro package selected for its composition.

       Man pages should be encoded using Unicode basic Latin code points exclusively, and employ the Unix  line-
       ending convention (U+000A only).

   <b>Fundamental</b> <b>concepts</b>
       <u>groff</u>  is  a  programming  system  for  typesetting: we thus often use the verb “to set” in the sense “to
       typeset”.  The formatter <u><a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff</a></u>(1) collects words from the input and <u>fills</u> output lines with  as  many  as
       will  fit.   <u>Words</u>  are  separated by spaces and newlines.  A transition to a new output line is called a
       <u>break.</u>  When formatted, a word may be broken at hyphens, at <b>\%</b> or <b>\:</b>  escape  sequences  (see  subsection
       “Portability”  below),  or  at  predetermined locations if automatic hyphenation is enabled (see the <b>-rHY</b>
       option in section “Options” below).  An output line may be supplemented with  <u>inter-sentence</u>  <u>space,</u>  and
       then  optionally  <u>adjusted</u>  with  more  space to a consistent line length (see the <b>-dAD</b> option).  <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7)
       details these processes.

       An input line that starts with a dot (.) or neutral apostrophe (') is a <u>control</u> <u>line.</u>  To call  a  macro,
       put  its name after a dot on a control line.  We refer to macros in this document using this leading dot.
       Some macros interpret <u>arguments,</u> words that follow the  macro  name.   A  newline,  unless  escaped  (see
       subsection  “Portability”  below),  marks  the  end of the macro call.  An input line consisting of a dot
       followed by a newline is called the <u>empty</u> <u>request;</u> it does nothing.  <u>Text</u> <u>lines</u> are input lines that  are
       not control lines.

       We  describe  below several <u>man</u> macros that plant one-line <u>input</u> <u>traps:</u> the next input line that directly
       produces formatted output is treated specially.  For <u>man</u> documents that  follow  the  advice  in  section
       “Portability”  below,  this  means that control lines using the empty request and uncommented input lines
       ending with an escaped newline do not spring the  trap;  anything  else  does  (but  see  the  <b>.TP</b>  macro
       description).

   <b>Macro</b> <b>reference</b> <b>preliminaries</b>
       A tagged paragraph describes each macro.  We present coupled pairs together, as with <b>.EX</b> and <b>.EE</b>.

       Optional  macro  arguments  are  indicated  by surrounding them with square brackets.  If a macro accepts
       multiple arguments, those containing space characters must be double-quoted to be interpreted  correctly.
       An  empty  macro  argument  can  be  specified  with a pair of double-quotes (""), but the <u>man</u> package is
       designed such that this should seldom be necessary.  See section “Notes”  below  for  examples  of  cases
       where  better alternatives to empty arguments in macro calls are available.  Most macro arguments will be
       formatted as text in the output; exceptions are noted.

   <b>Document</b> <b>structure</b> <b>macros</b>
       Document structure macros organize a man page's content.  All of them break the output line.  <b>.TH</b>  (title
       heading)  identifies  the  document  as  a man page and configures the page headers and footers.  Section
       headings (<b>.SH</b>), one of which is mandatory and many  of  which  are  conventionally  expected,  facilitate
       location  of  material  by the reader and aid the man page writer to discuss all essential aspects of the
       topic.  Subsection headings (<b>.SS</b>) are optional and permit  sections  that  grow  long  to  develop  in  a
       controlled  way.   Many  technical  discussions  benefit  from  examples;  lengthy ones, especially those
       reflecting multiple lines of input to or output from the system, are usefully bracketed by <b>.EX</b>  and  <b>.EE</b>.
       When  none  of  the  foregoing  meets  a  structural  demand,  use  <b>.RS</b>/<b>.RE</b>  to  inset  a region within a
       (sub)section.

       <b>.TH</b> <u>topic</u> <u>section</u> [<u>footer-middle</u>] [<u>footer-inside</u>] [<u>header-middle</u>]
              Determine the contents of the page header and footer.  <u>roff</u> systems refer to these collectively as
              “titles”.  The subject of the man page is <u>topic</u> and the section of the manual to which it  belongs
              is <u>section.</u>  This use of “section” has nothing to do with the section headings otherwise discussed
              in  this  page;  it  arises from the organizational scheme of printed and bound Unix manuals.  See
              <u><a href="../man1/man.1.html">man</a></u>(1) or <u><a href="../man1/intro.1.html">intro</a></u>(1) for the manual sectioning applicable to your system.   <u>topic</u>  and  <u>section</u>  are
              positioned  together  at the left and right in the header (with <u>section</u> in parentheses immediately
              appended to <u>topic</u>).  <u>footer-middle</u> is centered in the footer.  The arrangement of the rest of  the
              footer depends on whether double-sided layout is enabled with the option <b>-rD1</b>.  When disabled (the
              default), <u>footer-inside</u> is positioned at the bottom left.  Otherwise, <u>footer-inside</u> appears at the
              bottom left on recto (odd-numbered) pages, and at the bottom right on verso (even-numbered) pages.
              The  outside  footer  is  the  page number, except in the continuous-rendering mode enabled by the
              option <b>-rcR=1</b>, in which case it is the <u>topic</u> and <u>section,</u> as  in  the  header.   <u>header-middle</u>  is
              centered in the header.  If <u>section</u> is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), there is no need to
              specify  <u>header-middle;</u>  <u>an.tmac</u>  will  supply text for it.  The macro package may also abbreviate
              <u>topic</u> and <u>footer-inside</u> with ellipses (<b>...</b>) if they would  overrun  the  space  available  in  the
              header and footer, respectively.  For HTML output, headers and footers are suppressed.

              Additionally,  this  macro  breaks  the page, resetting the number to 1 (unless the <b>-rC1</b> option is
              given).  This feature is intended only for formatting multiple <u>man</u> documents in sequence.

              A valid <u>man</u> document calls <b>.TH</b> once, early in the file, prior to any other macro calls.

              By convention, <u>footer-middle</u> is the date of the most recent modification to the  man  page  source
              document, and <u>footer-inside</u> is the name and version or release of the project providing it.

       <b>.SH</b> [<u>heading-text</u>]
              Set <u>heading-text</u> as a section heading.  If no argument is given, a one-line input trap is planted;
              text  on  the next line becomes <u>heading-text.</u>  The left margin is reset to zero to set the heading
              text in bold (or the font specified by the string  <b>HF</b>),  and,  on  typesetting  devices,  slightly
              larger  than  the  base  type size.  If the heading font <b>\*[HF]</b> is bold, use of an italic style in
              <u>heading-text</u> is mapped to the bold-italic style if available in the font family.  The inset  level
              is  reset  to 1, setting the left margin to the value of the <b>IN</b> register.  Text after <u>heading-text</u>
              is set as an ordinary paragraph (<b>.P</b>).

              The content of <u>heading-text</u> and ordering of sections follows a set of  common  practices,  as  has
              much  of  the  layout of material within sections.  For example, a section called “Name” or “NAME”
              must exist, must be the first section after the <b>.TH</b> call, and must contain only text of the form
                     <u>topic</u>[<b>,</b> <u>another-topic</u>]... \- <u>summary-description</u>
              for a man page to be properly indexed.  See <u><a href="../man7/man.7.html">man</a></u>(7) for the conventions prevailing on your system.

       <b>.SS</b> [<u>subheading-text</u>]
              Set <u>subheading-text</u> as a subsection heading indented between a section  heading  and  an  ordinary
              paragraph  (<b>.P</b>).  If no argument is given, a one-line input trap is planted; text on the next line
              becomes <u>subheading-text.</u>  The left margin is reset to the value of the  <b>SN</b>  register  to  set  the
              heading  text  in  bold  (or  the font specified by the string <b>HF</b>).  If the heading font <b>\*[HF]</b> is
              bold, use of an italic style in <u>subheading-text</u> is mapped to the bold-italic style if available in
              the font family.  The inset level is reset to 1, setting the left margin to the value  of  the  <b>IN</b>
              register.  Text after <u>subheading-text</u> is set as an ordinary paragraph (<b>.P</b>).

       <b>.EX</b>
       <b>.EE</b>    Begin  and  end example.  After <b>.EX</b>, filling is disabled and a constant-width (monospaced) font is
              selected.  Calling <b>.EE</b> enables filling and restores the previous font.

              Example regions are useful for formatting code,  shell  sessions,  and  text  file  contents.   An
              example  region is not a “literal mode” of any sort: special character escape sequences must still
              be used to produce correct glyphs for <b>'</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>\</b>, <b>^</b>,  <b>`</b>,  and  <b>~</b>,  and  sentence  endings  are  still
              detected  and additional inter-sentence space applied.  If the amount of additional inter-sentence
              spacing is altered, the rendering of, for instance, regular expressions using <b>.</b> or <b>?</b>  followed  by
              multiple spaces can change.  Use the dummy character escape sequence <b>\&amp;</b> before the spaces.

              These  macros  are  extensions  introduced  in  Ninth Edition Research Unix.  Systems running that
              <u>troff</u>, or those from Documenter's Workbench, Heirloom Doctools, or Plan 9 <u>troff</u> support them.   To
              be  certain  your  page  will  be portable to systems that do not, copy their definitions from the
              <u>an-ext.tmac</u> file of a <u>groff</u> installation.

       <b>.RS</b> [<u>inset-amount</u>]
              Start a new relative inset level.  The position of the left margin is saved, then moved  right  by
              <u>inset-amount,</u>  if  specified, and by the amount of the <b>IN</b> register otherwise.  Calls to <b>.RS</b> can be
              nested; each increments by 1 the inset level used by <b>.RE</b>.  The level prior to any <b>.RS</b> calls is 1.

       <b>.RE</b> [<u>level</u>]
              End a relative inset.  The left margin corresponding to inset level  <u>level</u>  is  restored.   If  no
              argument is given, the inset level is reduced by 1.

   <b>Paragraphing</b> <b>macros</b>
       An  ordinary  paragraph  (<b>.P</b>)  like  this one is set without a first-line indentation at the current left
       margin.  In man pages and other technical literature, definition lists are frequently encountered;  these
       can  be  set  as  “tagged  paragraphs”,  which  have  one  (<b>.TP</b>) or more (<b>.TQ</b>) leading tags followed by a
       paragraph that has an additional indentation.  The indented paragraph (<b>.IP</b>) macro is useful  to  continue
       the  indented content of a narrative started with <b>.TP</b>, or to present an itemized or ordered list.  All of
       these macros break the output line.  If another paragraph macro has occurred since the  previous  <b>.SH</b>  or
       <b>.SS</b>, they (except for <b>.TQ</b>) follow the break with a default amount of vertical space, which can be changed
       by the deprecated <b>.PD</b> macro; see subsection “Horizontal and vertical spacing” below.  They also reset the
       type size and font style to defaults (<b>.TQ</b> again excepted); see subsection “Font style macros” below.

       <b>.P</b>
       <b>.LP</b>
       <b>.PP</b>    Begin  a  new  paragraph;  these  macros  are synonymous.  The indentation is reset to the default
              value; the left margin, as affected by <b>.RS</b> and <b>.RE</b>, is not.

       <b>.TP</b> [<u>indentation</u>]
              Set a paragraph with a leading tag, and the remainder of the paragraph indented.  A one-line input
              trap is planted; text on the next line, which can be formatted with  a  macro,  becomes  the  tag,
              which  is placed at the current left margin.  The tag can be extended with the <b>\c</b> escape sequence.
              Subsequent text is indented by <u>indentation,</u> if specified, and by the amount  of  the  <b>IN</b>  register
              otherwise.  If the tag is not as wide as the indentation, the paragraph starts on the same line as
              the  tag,  at  the  applicable  indentation, and continues on the following lines.  Otherwise, the
              descriptive part of the paragraph begins on the line following the tag.

              The line containing the tag can include a macro call, for instance to set the tag in bold with <b>.B</b>.
              <b>.TP</b> was used to write the first paragraph of this description of <b>.TP</b>, and <b>.IP</b> the subsequent one.

       <b>.TQ</b>    Set an additional tag for a paragraph tagged with <b>.TP</b>.  An input trap is planted as with <b>.TP</b>.

              This macro is a GNU extension not defined on systems running AT&amp;T, Plan 9, or Solaris  <u>troff</u>;  see
              <u>an-ext.tmac</u> in section “Files” below.

              The descriptions of <b>.P</b>, <b>.LP</b>, and <b>.PP</b> above were written using <b>.TP</b> and <b>.TQ</b>.

       <b>.IP</b> [<u>tag</u>] [<u>indentation</u>]
              Set  an  indented  paragraph with an optional tag.  The <u>tag</u> and <u>indentation</u> arguments, if present,
              are handled as with <b>.TP</b>, with the exception that the <u>tag</u> argument to <b>.IP</b> cannot  include  a  macro
              call.

              Two convenient uses for <b>.IP</b> are

                  (1) to  start a new paragraph with the same indentation as an immediately preceding <b>.IP</b> or <b>.TP</b>
                      paragraph, if no <u>indentation</u> argument is given; and

                  (2) to set a paragraph with a short <u>tag</u> that is not semantically important, such as  a  bullet
                      (•)—obtained  with  the <b>\(bu</b> special character escape sequence—or list enumerator, as seen
                      in this very paragraph.

   <b>Command</b> <b>synopsis</b> <b>macros</b>
       <b>.SY</b> and <b>.YS</b> aid you to construct a command synopsis that has the classical Unix appearance.   They  break
       the output line.

       These  macros  are  GNU  extensions  not  defined  on systems running AT&amp;T, Plan 9, or Solaris <u>troff</u>; see
       <u>an-ext.tmac</u> in section “Files” below.

       <b>.SY</b> <u>command</u>
              Begin synopsis.  A new paragraph begins at the left margin (as with <b>.P</b>)  unless  <b>.SY</b>  has  already
              been  called without a corresponding <b>.YS</b>, in which case only a break is performed.  Adjustment and
              automatic hyphenation are disabled.  <u>command</u> is set in bold.  If a break is required, lines  after
              the first are indented by the width of <u>command</u> plus a space.

       <b>.YS</b>    End synopsis.  Indentation, adjustment, and hyphenation are restored to their previous states.

       Multiple  <b>.SY</b>/<b>.YS</b>  blocks can be specified, for instance to distinguish differing modes of operation of a
       complex command like <u><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a></u>(1); each will be vertically separated as paragraphs are.

       <b>.SY</b> can be repeated before <b>.YS</b> to indicate synonymous ways of invoking a particular mode of operation.

       <u>groff</u>'s own command-line interface serves to illustrate most of the specimens of synopsis syntax  one  is
       likely to encounter.

       Several features of the above example are of note.

       • The  empty  request (.), which does nothing, is used to vertically space the input file for readability
         by the document maintainer.  Do not put blank (empty) lines in a man page source document.

       • Command and option names are presented in <b>bold</b> to cue the user that they should be input literally.

       • Option dashes are specified with the <b>\-</b> escape sequence; this is an important  practice  to  make  them
         clearly  visible  and to facilitate copy-and-paste from the rendered man page to a shell prompt or text
         file.

       • Option arguments and command operands are presented in <u>italics</u> (but see subsection “Font style  macros”
         below regarding terminals) to cue the user that they must be replaced with appropriate text.

       • Symbols  that  are  neither  to  be typed literally nor replaced at the user's discretion appear in the
         roman style; brackets surround  optional  arguments,  and  an  ellipsis  indicates  that  the  previous
         syntactical element may be repeated arbitrarily.

       • The  non-breaking  adjustable  space  escape  sequence <b>\~</b> is used to prevent the output line from being
         broken within the option brackets; see subsection “Portability” below.

       • The output line continuation escape sequence <b>\c</b> is used with font style alternation macros to allow all
         three font styles to be set without (breakable) space among them; see subsection “Portability” below.

       • The dummy character escape sequence <b>\&amp;</b> follows the ellipsis when further text will follow  after  space
         on the output line, keeping its last period from being interpreted as the end of a sentence and causing
         additional inter-sentence space to be placed after it.  See subsection “Portability” below.

   <b>Hyperlink</b> <b>macros</b>
       Man  page  cross  references  like  <u><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></u>(1)  are best presented with <b>.MR</b>.  Text may be hyperlinked to email
       addresses with <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME</b> or other URIs with <b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE</b>.  Hyperlinked text is supported on  HTML  and  terminal
       output devices; terminals and pager programs must support ECMA-48 OSC 8 escape sequences (see <u><a href="../man1/grotty.1.html">grotty</a></u>(1)).
       When device support is unavailable or disabled with the <b>U</b> register (see section “Options” below), <b>.MT</b> and
       <b>.UR</b> URIs are rendered between angle brackets after the linked text.

       <b>.MT</b>,  <b>.ME</b>, <b>.UR</b>, and <b>.UE</b> are GNU extensions not defined on systems running AT&amp;T, Plan 9, or Solaris <u>troff</u>;
       see <u>an-ext.tmac</u> in section “Files” below.  Plan 9 from User Space's <u>troff</u> implements <b>.MR</b>.

       The arguments to <b>.MR</b>, <b>.MT</b>, and <b>.UR</b> should be prepared for  typesetting  since  they  can  appear  in  the
       output.  Use special character escape sequences to encode Unicode basic Latin characters where necessary,
       particularly  the  hyphen-minus.  (See section “Portability” below.)  URIs can be lengthy; rendering them
       can result in jarring adjustment or variations in line length, or <u>troff</u>  warnings  when  a  hyperlink  is
       longer  than  an output line.  The application of non-printing break point escape sequences <b>\:</b> after each
       slash (or series thereof), and before each dot (or series thereof) is recommended as  a  rule  of  thumb.
       The  former practice avoids forcing a trailing slash in a URI onto a separate output line, and the latter
       helps the reader to avoid mistakenly interpreting a dot at the end of a line as  a  period  (or  multiple
       dots as an ellipsis).  Thus,
              .UR http://\:example\:.com/\:fb8afcfbaebc74e\:.cc
       has  several  potential  break  points in the URI shown.  Consider adding break points before or after at
       signs in email addresses, and question  marks,  ampersands,  and  number  signs  in  HTTP(S)  URIs.   The
       formatter  removes  <b>\:</b>  escape sequences from hyperlinks when supplying device control commands to output
       drivers.

       <b>.MR</b> <u>topic</u> <u>manual-section</u> [<u>trailing-text</u>]
              <u>(since</u> groff <u>1.23)</u> Set a man page cross reference as  “<u>topic</u><b>(</b><u>manual-section</u><b>)</b>”.   If  <u>trailing-text</u>
              (typically  punctuation)  is  specified,  it  follows  the closing parenthesis without intervening
              space.  Hyphenation is disabled while the cross reference is  set.   <u>topic</u>  is  set  in  the  font
              specified   by   the   <b>MF</b>   string.   The  cross  reference  hyperlinks  to  a  URI  of  the  form
              “<b>man:</b><u>topic</u>(<u>manual-section</u>)”.

              calls  as  the  link  text.   An argument to <b>.ME</b> is placed after the link text without intervening
              space.  <u>address</u> may not be visible  in  the  rendered  document  if  hyperlinks  are  enabled  and
              supported  by the output driver.  If they are not, <u>address</u> is set in angle brackets after the link

              visible in the rendered document if hyperlinks are enabled and supported by the output driver.  If
              they are not, <u>uri</u> is set in angle brackets after the  link  text  and  before  <u>trailing-text.</u>   If

   <b>Font</b> <b>style</b> <b>macros</b>
       The  <u>man</u>  macro package is limited in its font styling options, offering only <b>bold</b> (<b>.B</b>), <u>italic</u> (<b>.I</b>), and
       roman.  Italic text is usually set underscored instead on terminal devices.  The <b>.SM</b> and <b>.SB</b>  macros  set
       text  in  roman  or  bold, respectively, at a smaller type size; these differ visually from regular-sized
       roman or bold text only on typesetting devices.  It is often necessary to set text  in  different  styles
       without intervening space.  The macros <b>.BI</b>, <b>.BR</b>, <b>.IB</b>, <b>.IR</b>, <b>.RB</b>, and <b>.RI</b>, where “B”, “I”, and “R” indicate
       bold,  italic, and roman, respectively, set their odd- and even-numbered arguments in alternating styles,
       with no space separating them.

       Because font styles are presentational rather than semantic, conflicting traditions have arisen regarding
       which font styles should be used to mark file or path names, environment variables, and inlined literals.

       The default type size and family for typesetting devices is 10-point Times,  except  on  the  <b>X75-12</b>  and
       <b>X100-12</b> devices where the type size is 12 points.  The default style is roman.

       <b>.B</b> [<u>text</u>]
              Set  <u>text</u>  in  bold.   If no argument is given, a one-line input trap is planted; text on the next
              line, which can be further formatted with a macro, is set in bold.

              Use bold for literal portions of syntax synopses, for command-line options in  running  text,  and
              for  literals  that  are major topics of the subject under discussion; for example, this page uses
              bold for macro, string, and register names.  In an <b>.EX</b>/<b>.EE</b> example of interactive I/O (such  as  a
              shell session), set only user input in bold.

       <b>.I</b> [<u>text</u>]
              Set <u>text</u> in an italic or oblique face.  If no argument is given, a one-line input trap is planted;
              text on the next line, which can be further formatted with a macro, is set in an italic or oblique
              face.

              Use  italics for file and path names, for environment variables, for C data types, for enumeration
              or preprocessor constants in C, for variant (user-replaceable) portions of  syntax  synopses,  for
              the  first occurrence (only) of a technical concept being introduced, for names of journals and of
              literary works longer than an article, and anywhere a parameter requiring replacement by the  user
              is  encountered.  An exception involves variant text in a context already typeset in italics, such
              as file or path names with replaceable  components;  in  such  cases,  follow  the  convention  of
              mathematical  typography:  set  the  file  or  path name in italics as usual but use roman for the
              variant part (see <b>.IR</b> and <b>.RI</b> below), and italics again in running roman text  when  referring  to
              the variant material.

       <b>.SM</b> [<u>text</u>]
              Set  <u>text</u>  one point smaller than the default type size on typesetting devices.  If no argument is
              given, a one-line input trap is planted; text on the next line, which  can  be  further  formatted
              with a macro, is set smaller.

              <u>Note:</u>  terminals  will  render  <u>text</u>  at normal size instead.  Do not rely upon <b>.SM</b> to communicate
              semantic information distinct from using roman style at  normal  size;  it  will  be  hidden  from
              readers using such devices.

       <b>.SB</b> [<u>text</u>]
              Set <u>text</u> in bold and (on typesetting devices) one point smaller than the default type size.  If no
              argument  is  given, a one-line input trap is planted; text on the next line, which can be further
              formatted with a macro, is set smaller and in bold.  This macro  is  an  extension  introduced  in
              SunOS 4.0.

              <u>Note:</u>  terminals  will  render  <u>text</u>  in bold at the normal size instead.  Do not rely upon <b>.SB</b> to
              communicate semantic information distinct from using bold style at normal size; it will be  hidden
              from readers using such devices.

       Observe what is <u>not</u> prescribed for setting in bold or italics above: elements of “synopsis language” such
       as ellipses and brackets around options; proper names and adjectives; titles of anything other than major
       works of literature; identifiers for standards documents or technical reports such as CSTR #54, RFC 1918,
       Unicode 13.0, or POSIX.1-2017; acronyms; and occurrences after the first of a technical term.

       Be  frugal  with  italics  for  emphasis,  and  particularly with bold.  Article titles and brief runs of
       literal text, such as references to  individual  characters  or  short  strings,  including  section  and
       subsection  headings of man pages, are suitable objects for quotation; see the <b>\(lq</b>, <b>\(rq</b>, <b>\(oq</b>, and <b>\(cq</b>
       escape sequences in subsection “Portability” below.

       Unlike the above font style macros, the font style alternation macros below set no input traps; they must
       be given arguments to have effect.  Italic corrections  are  applied  as  appropriate.   If  a  space  is
       required  within  an  argument,  first  consider  whether  the same result could be achieved with as much
       clarity by using single-style macros on separate input lines.  When it cannot, double-quote  an  argument
       containing  embedded  space  characters.   Setting  all  three  different  styles  within a word presents
       challenges; it is possible with the <b>\c</b> and/or <b>\f</b> escape sequences.  See  subsection  “Portability”  below
       for approaches.

   <b>Horizontal</b> <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>spacing</b>
       The  <u>indentation</u>  argument  accepted  by  <b>.IP</b>,  <b>.TP</b>,  and the deprecated <b>.HP</b> is a number plus an optional
       scaling unit, as is <b>.RS</b>'s <u>inset-amount</u>.  If no scaling unit is given, the <u>man</u> package assumes  “n”;  that
       is, the width of a letter “n” in the font current when the macro is called (see section “Measurements” in
       <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7)).   An  indentation  specified  in  a call to <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, or the deprecated <b>.HP</b> persists until (1)
       another of these macros is called with an <u>indentation</u> argument, or (2) <b>.SH</b>, <b>.SS</b>, or <b>.P</b> or its synonyms is
       called; these clear the indentation entirely.

       The left margin used by ordinary paragraphs set with <b>.P</b> (and its synonyms) not within an <b>.RS</b>/<b>.RE</b> relative
       inset is 7.2n for typesetting devices and 7n for terminal devices (but see the  <b>-rIN</b>  option).   Headers,
       footers  (both  set  with  <b>.TH</b>), and section headings (<b>.SH</b>) are set at the page offset (see <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7)) and
       subsection headings (<b>.SS</b>) indented from it by 3n (but see the <b>-rSN</b> option).

       It may be helpful to think of the left margin and indentation as related but distinct  concepts;  <u>groff</u>'s
       implementation  of  the  <u>man</u> macro package tracks them separately.  The left margin is manipulated by <b>.RS</b>
       and <b>.RE</b> (and by <b>.SH</b> and <b>.SS</b>,  which  reset  it  to  the  default).   Indentation  is  controlled  by  the
       paragraphing  macros (though, again, <b>.SH</b> and <b>.SS</b> reset it); it is imposed by the <b>.TP</b>, <b>.IP</b>, and deprecated
       <b>.HP</b> macros, and cancelled by <b>.P</b> and its synonyms.  An extensive example follows.

       This ordinary (<b>.P</b>) paragraph is not in a relative inset nor does it possess an indentation.

              Now we have created a relative inset (in other words, moved the left margin) with <b>.RS</b> and  started
              another ordinary paragraph with <b>.P</b>.

              <b>tag</b>    This  tagged  paragraph,  set with <b>.TP</b>, is still within the <b>.RS</b> region, but lines after the
                     first have a supplementary indentation that the tag lacks.

                     A paragraph like this one, set with <b>.IP</b>, will appear to the reader as also associated  with
                     the  tag  above,  because  <b>.IP</b> re-uses the previous paragraph's indentation unless given an
                     argument to change it.  This paragraph is affected both by the moved left margin (<b>.RS</b>)  and
                     indentation (<b>.IP</b>).
                     ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
                     │ This table is affected both by   │
                     │ the left margin and indentation. │
                     └──────────────────────────────────┘

              •      This indented paragraph has a bullet for a tag, making it more obvious that the left margin
                     and  indentation are distinct; only the former affects the tag, but both affect the text of
                     the paragraph.

              This ordinary (<b>.P</b>) paragraph resets the indentation, but the left margin is still inset.
              ┌─────────────────────────────┐
              │ This table is affected only │
              │ by the left margin.         │
              └─────────────────────────────┘

       Finally, we have ended the relative inset by using <b>.RE</b>, which (because we used only one <b>.RS</b>/<b>.RE</b> pair) has
       reset the left margin to the default.  This is an ordinary <b>.P</b> paragraph.

       Resist the temptation to mock up tabular or multi-column output with tab characters  or  the  indentation
       arguments  to <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, <b>.RS</b>, or the deprecated <b>.HP</b>; the result may not render comprehensibly on an output
       device you fail to check, or which is developed in the future.  The table preprocessor <u><a href="../man1/tbl.1.html">tbl</a></u>(1) can  likely
       meet your needs.

       Several  macros insert vertical space: <b>.SH</b>, <b>.SS</b>, <b>.TP</b>, <b>.P</b> (and its synonyms), <b>.IP</b>, and the deprecated <b>.HP</b>.
       The default inter-section and inter-paragraph spacing  is  is  1v  for  terminal  devices  and  0.4v  for
       typesetting  devices  (“v” is a unit of vertical distance, where 1v is the distance between adjacent text
       baselines in a single-spaced document).  (The deprecated macro <b>.PD</b> can change this vertical spacing,  but
       its  use  is  discouraged.)   Between  <b>.EX</b> and <b>.EE</b> calls, the inter-paragraph spacing is 1v regardless of
       output device.

   <b>Registers</b>
       Registers are described in section “Options” below.  They can be set not only on the command line but  in
       the site <u>man.local</u> file as well; see section “Files” below.

   <b>Strings</b>
       The  following  strings  are  defined  for  use  in man pages.  Others are supported for configuration of
       rendering parameters; see section “Options” below.

       <b>\*R</b>    interpolates a special character escape  sequence  for  the  “registered  sign”  glyph,  <b>\(rg</b>,  if
              available, and “(Reg.)” otherwise.

       <b>\*S</b>    interpolates an escape sequence setting the type size to the document default.

       <b>\*(lq</b>
       <b>\*(rq</b>  interpolate special character escape sequences for left and right double-quotation marks, <b>\(lq</b> and
              <b>\(rq</b>, respectively.

       <b>\*(Tm</b>  interpolates  a  special  character  escape  sequence  for  the  “trade mark sign” glyph, <b>\(tm</b>, if
              available, and “(TM)” otherwise.

       None of the above is necessary in a contemporary man page.  <b>\*S</b> is superfluous, since type  size  changes
       are invisible on terminal devices and macros that change it restore its original value afterward.  Better
       alternatives  exist  for  the  rest;  simply  use the <b>\(rg</b>, <b>\(lq</b>, <b>\(rq</b>, and <b>\(tm</b> special character escape
       sequences directly.  Unless a man page author is aiming for a pathological level of portability, such  as
       the  composition  of  pages for consumption on simulators of 1980s Unix systems (or Solaris <u>troff</u>, though
       even it supports <b>\(rg</b>), the above strings should be avoided.

   <b>Portability</b>
       It is wise to quote multi-word section and  subsection  headings;  the  <b>.SH</b>  and  <b>.SS</b>  macros  of  <u><a href="../man7/man.7.html">man</a></u>(7)
       implementations  descended  from  Seventh  Edition  Unix  supported  six  arguments  at  most.  A similar
       restriction applied to the <b>.B</b>, <b>.I</b>, <b>.SM</b>, and font style alternation macros.

       The two major syntactical categories for formatting control in the <u>roff</u> language are requests and  escape
       sequences.   Since  the  <u>man</u>  macros are implemented in terms of <u>groff</u> requests and escape sequences, one
       can, in principle, supplement the functionality of <u>man</u> with these lower-level elements where necessary.

       However, using raw <u>groff</u> requests (apart from the empty request “<b>.</b>”) is likely to make your  page  render
       poorly  when  processed  by  other  tools;  many  of these attempt to interpret page sources directly for
       conversion to HTML.  Some requests make implicit assumptions about things like character and  page  sizes
       that  may  not  hold  in  an HTML environment; also, many of these viewers don't interpret the full <u>groff</u>
       vocabulary, a problem that can lead to portions of your text being omitted or presented incomprehensibly.

       For portability to modern viewers, it is best to write your page solely with the macros described in this
       page (except for the ones identified as deprecated,  which  should  be  avoided).   The  macros  we  have
       described  as  extensions  (<b>.EX</b>/<b>.EE</b>,  <b>.SY</b>/<b>.YS</b>,  <b>.TQ</b>,  <b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE</b>, <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME</b>, <b>.MR</b>, and <b>.SB</b>) should be used with
       caution, as they may not be built in to some viewer that is important to your audience.  See  <u>an-ext.tmac</u>
       in section “Files” below.

       Similar  caveats  apply  to  escape  sequences.   Some  escape sequences are however required for correct
       typesetting even in man pages and usually do not cause portability problems.   Several  of  these  render
       glyphs corresponding to punctuation code points in the Unicode basic Latin range (U+0000–U+007F) that are
       handled  specially  in  <u>roff</u>  input; the escape sequences below must be used to render them correctly and
       portably when documenting material that uses them syntactically—namely, any of the  set  <b>'</b>  <b>-</b>  <b>\</b>  <b>^</b>  <b>`</b>  <b>~</b>
       (apostrophe, dash or minus, backslash, caret, grave accent, tilde).

       <b>\"</b>     Comment.   Everything  after the double-quote to the end of the input line is ignored.  Whole-line
              comments should be placed immediately after the empty request (“<b>.</b>”).

       <b>\</b><u>newline</u>
              Join the next input line to the current one.  Except for the update  of  the  input  line  counter
              (used for diagnostic messages and related purposes), a series of lines ending in backslash-newline
              appears to <u>groff</u> as a single input line.  Use this escape sequence to split excessively long input
              lines for document maintenance.

       <b>\%</b>     Control  hyphenation.   The  location  of  this  escape sequence within a word marks a hyphenation
              point, supplementing <u>groff</u>'s automatic hyphenation patterns.  At  the  beginning  of  a  word,  it
              suppresses any hyphenation breaks within <u>except</u> those specified with <b>\%</b>.

       <b>\:</b>     Insert  a  non-printing  break point.  A word can break at such a point, but a hyphen glyph is not
              written to the output if it does.  This  escape  sequence  is  an  input  word  boundary,  so  the
              remainder  of  the word is subject to hyphenation as normal.  You can use <b>\:</b> and <b>\%</b> in combination
              to control breaking of a file name or URI or to permit hyphenation  only  after  certain  explicit
              hyphens within a word.  See subsection “Hyperlink macros” above for an example.

              This  escape  sequence  is  a  <u>groff</u>  extension  also  supported by Heirloom Doctools <u>troff</u> 050915
              (September 2005), <u>mandoc</u> 1.14.5 (2019-03-10), and <u>neatroff</u> (commit 399a4936, 2014-02-17), but  not
              by Plan 9, Solaris, or Documenter's Workbench <u>troff</u>s.

       <b>\~</b>     Adjustable  non-breaking space.  Use this escape sequence to prevent a break inside a short phrase
              or between a numerical quantity and its corresponding unit(s).

                     Before starting the motor,
                     set the output speed to\~1.
                     There are 1,024\~bytes in 1\~KiB.
                     CSTR\~#8 documents the B\~language.

              This escape sequence is a <u>groff</u>  extension  also  supported  by  Heirloom  Doctools  <u>troff</u>  050915
              (September  2005),  <u>mandoc</u> 1.9.5 (2009-09-21), <u>neatroff</u> (commit 1c6ab0f6e, 2016-09-13), and Plan 9
              from User Space <u>troff</u>  (commit  93f8143600,  2022-08-12),  but  not  by  Solaris  or  Documenter's
              Workbench <u>troff</u>s.

       <b>\&amp;</b>     Dummy  character.   Insert  at  the beginning of an input line to prevent a dot or apostrophe from
              being interpreted as beginning a <u>roff</u> control line.   Append  to  an  end-of-sentence  punctuation
              sequence to keep it from being recognized as such.

       <b>\|</b>     Thin  space  (one-sixth  em  on typesetters, zero-width on terminals); a non-breaking space.  Used
              primarily in ellipses (“.\|.\|.”)  to space the dots more pleasantly on typesetting  devices  like
              <b>dvi</b>, <b>pdf</b>, and <b>ps</b>.

       <b>\c</b>     End  a  text line without inserting space or attempting a break.  Normally, if filling is enabled,
              the end of a text line is treated like a space; an output line <u>may</u> be broken  there  (if  not,  an
              adjustable  space  is  inserted);  if  filling  is  disabled, the line <u>will</u> be broken there, as in
              <b>.EX</b>/<b>.EE</b> examples.  The next line is interpreted as usual and can include a  macro  call  (contrast
              with  <b>\</b><u>newline</u>).  <b>\c</b> is useful when three font styles are needed in a single word, as in a command
              synopsis.

                     .RB [ \-\-stylesheet=\c
                     .IR name ]

              It also helps when changing font styles in <b>.EX</b>/<b>.EE</b> examples, since they are not filled.

                     .EX
                     $ \c
                     .B groff \-T utf8 \-Z \c
                     .I file \c
                     .B | grotty \-i
                     .EE

              Alternatively, and perhaps with better portability, the <b>\f</b> font selection escape sequence  can  be
              used; see below.  Using <b>\c</b> to continue a <b>.TP</b> paragraph tag across multiple input lines will render
              incorrectly  with  <u>groff</u> 1.22.3, <u>mandoc</u> 1.14.1, older versions of these programs, and perhaps with
              some other formatters.

       <b>\e</b>     Format the current escape character on the output; widely used in man pages to render a  backslash
              glyph.   It  works reliably as long as the “.ec” request is not used, which should never happen in
              man pages, and it is slightly more portable  than  the  more  explicit  <b>\(rs</b>  (“reverse  solidus”)
              special character escape sequence.

       <b>\fB</b>, <b>\fI</b>, <b>\fR</b>, <b>\fP</b>
              Switch  to  bold,  italic, roman, or back to the previous style, respectively.  Either <b>\f</b> or <b>\c</b> is
              needed when three different font styles are required in a word.

                     .RB [ \-\-reference\-dictionary=\fI\,name\/\fP ]

                     .RB [ \-\-reference\-dictionary=\c
                     .IR name ]

              Style escape sequences may be more portable than <b>\c</b>.  As shown above, it is up to you  to  account
              for  italic corrections with “<b>\/</b>” and “<b>\,</b>”, which are themselves GNU extensions, if desired and if
              supported by your implementation.

              <b>\fP</b> reliably returns to the style in use immediately preceding the  previous  <b>\f</b>  escape  sequence
              only if no sectioning, paragraph, or style macro calls have intervened.

              As long as at most two styles are needed in a word, style macros like <b>.B</b> and <b>.BI</b> usually result in
              more readable <u>roff</u> source than <b>\f</b> escape sequences do.

       Several  special  characters are also widely portable.  Except for <b>\-</b>, <b>\(em</b>, and <b>\(ga</b>, AT&amp;T <u>troff</u> did not
       consistently define the characters listed below, but its descendants, like Plan 9 or Solaris  <u>troff</u>,  can
       be  made  to  support  them  by  defining them in font description files, making them aliases of existing
       glyphs if necessary; see <u><a href="../man5/groff_font.5.html">groff_font</a></u>(5).

       <b>\-</b>     Minus sign or basic Latin hyphen-minus.  This  escape  sequence  produces  the  Unix  command-line
              option  dash  in the output.  “<b>-</b>” is a hyphen in the <u>roff</u> language; some output devices replace it
              with U+2010 (hyphen) or similar.

       <b>\(aq</b>   Basic Latin neutral apostrophe.  Some output devices format “<b>'</b>” as a right single quotation mark.

       <b>\(oq</b>
       <b>\(cq</b>   Opening (left) and closing (right) single quotation  marks.   Use  these  for  paired  directional
              single quotes, ‘like this’.

       <b>\(dq</b>   Basic  Latin  quotation  mark  (double  quote).   Use  in  macro  calls  to prevent ‘<b>"</b>” from being
              interpreted as beginning a quoted argument, or simply for readability.

                     .TP
                     .BI "split \(dq" text \(dq

       <b>\(lq</b>
       <b>\(rq</b>   Left and right double quotation marks.  Use these for  paired  directional  double  quotes,  “like
              this”.

       <b>\(em</b>   Em-dash.  Use for an interruption—such as this one—in a sentence.

       <b>\(en</b>   En-dash.   Use  to  separate  the ends of a range, particularly between numbers; for example, “the
              digits 1–9”.

       <b>\(ga</b>   Basic Latin grave accent.  Some output devices format “<b>`</b>” as a left single quotation mark.

       <b>\(ha</b>   Basic Latin circumflex accent (“hat”).  Some output devices format “<b>^</b>” as U+02C6 (modifier  letter
              circumflex accent) or similar.

       <b>\(rs</b>   Reverse  solidus (backslash).  The backslash is the default escape character in the <u>roff</u> language,
              so it does not represent itself in output.  Also see <b>\e</b> above.

       <b>\(ti</b>   Basic Latin tilde.  Some output devices format “<b>~</b>” as U+02DC (small tilde) or similar.

       For maximum portability, escape sequences and special characters not listed above are better  avoided  in
       man pages.

   <b>Hooks</b>
       Two  macros,  both  GNU extensions, are called internally by the <u>groff</u> <u>man</u> package to format page headers
       and footers and can be redefined by the administrator in a site's <u>man.local</u>  file  (see  section  “Files”
       below).   The  presentation of <b>.TH</b> above describes the default headers and footers.  Because these macros
       are hooks for <u>groff</u> <u>man</u> internals, man pages have no reason to call them.   Such  hook  definitions  will
       likely  consist of “.sp” and “.tl” requests.  They must also increase the page length with “.pl” requests
       in continuous rendering mode; <b>.PT</b> furthermore has the responsibility of emitting  a  PDF  bookmark  after
       writing  the  first  page  header  in  a  document.  Consult the existing implementations in <u>an.tmac</u> when
       drafting replacements.

       <b>.BT</b>    Set the page footer text (“bottom trap”).

       <b>.PT</b>    Set the page header text (“page trap”).

       To remove a page header or footer entirely, define the appropriate macro as empty  rather  than  deleting
       it.

   <b>Deprecated</b> <b>features</b>
       Use of the following in man pages for public distribution is discouraged.

       <b>.AT</b> [<u>system</u> [<u>release</u>]]
              Alter  the  footer  for  use  with legacy AT&amp;T man pages, overriding any definition of the <u>footer-</u>
              <u>inside</u> argument to <b>.TH</b>.  This macro exists only to render man pages from historical systems.

              <u>system</u> can be any of the following.

                     3      7th edition <u>(default)</u>

                     4      System III

                     5      System V

              The optional <u>release</u> argument specifies the release number, as in “System V Release 3”.

       <b>.DT</b>    Reset tab stops to the default (every 0.5i [inches]).

              Use of this presentation-oriented macro is deprecated.  It translates poorly to HTML, under  which
              exact  space  control and tabulation are not readily available.  Thus, information or distinctions
              that you use tab stops to express are likely to be lost.  If you feel tempted to  change  the  tab
              stops  such  that  calling  this  macro later is desirable to restore them, you should probably be
              composing a table using <u><a href="../man1/tbl.1.html">tbl</a></u>(1) instead.

       <b>.HP</b> [<u>indentation</u>]
              Set up a paragraph with a hanging left indentation.  The  <u>indentation</u>  argument,  if  present,  is
              handled as with <b>.TP</b>.

              Use  of this presentation-oriented macro is deprecated.  A hanging indentation cannot be expressed
              naturally under HTML, and non-<u>roff</u>-based man page  interpreters  may  treat  <b>.HP</b>  as  an  ordinary
              paragraph.  Thus, information or distinctions you mean to express with indentation may be lost.

       <b>.OP</b> <u>option-name</u> [<u>option-argument</u>]
              Indicate  an  optional  command parameter called <u>option-name</u>, which is set in bold.  If the option
              takes an argument, specify <u>option-argument</u> using a noun, abbreviation, or hyphenated noun  phrase.
              If  present,  <u>option-argument</u> is preceded by a space and set in italics.  Square brackets in roman
              surround both arguments.

              Use of this quasi-semantic macro, an extension originating in  Documenter's  Workbench  <u>troff</u>,  is
              deprecated.   It cannot easily be used to annotate options that take optional arguments or options
              whose arguments have internal structure (such as a mixture of literal  and  variable  components).
              One could work around these limitations with font selection escape sequences, but it is preferable
              to use font style alternation macros, which afford greater flexibility.

       <b>.PD</b> [<u>vertical-space</u>]
              Define  the  vertical  space between paragraphs or (sub)sections.  The optional argument <u>vertical-</u>
              <u>space</u> specifies the amount; the default scaling unit is “v”.  Without an argument, the spacing  is
              reset to its default value; see subsection “Horizontal and vertical spacing” above.

              Use  of this presentation-oriented macro is deprecated.  It translates poorly to HTML, under which
              exact control  of  inter-paragraph  spacing  is  not  readily  available.   Thus,  information  or
              distinctions that you use <b>.PD</b> to express are likely to be lost.

       <b>.UC</b> [<u>version</u>]
              Alter the footer for use with legacy BSD man pages, overriding any definition of the <u>footer-inside</u>
              argument to <b>.TH</b>.  This macro exists only to render man pages from historical systems.

              <u>version</u> can be any of the following.

                     3      3rd Berkeley Distribution <u>(default)</u>

                     4      4th Berkeley Distribution

                     5      4.2 Berkeley Distribution

                     6      4.3 Berkeley Distribution

                     7      4.4 Berkeley Distribution

   <b>History</b>
       M. Douglas McIlroy  designed,  implemented,  and documented the AT&amp;T <u>man</u> macros for Unix Version 7 (1979)
       and employed them to edit the first volume of its <u>Programmer's</u> <u>Manual</u>, a compilation  of  all  man  pages
       supplied  by  the system.  That <u>man</u> supported the macros listed in this page not described as extensions,
       except <b>.P</b> and the deprecated <b>.AT</b> and <b>.UC</b>.  The only strings defined were  <b>R</b>  and  <b>S</b>;  no  registers  were
       documented.

       <b>.UC</b>  appeared  in 3BSD (1980).  Unix System III (1980) introduced <b>.P</b> and exposed the registers <b>IN</b> and <b>LL</b>,
       which had been internal to Seventh Edition Unix <u>man</u>.  PWB/UNIX 2.0 (1980)  added  the  <b>Tm</b>  string.   4BSD
       (1980)  added  <b>lq</b>  and  <b>rq</b> strings.  SunOS 2.0 (1985) recognized <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>P</b>, and <b>X</b> registers.  4.3BSD (1986)
       added <b>.AT</b> and <b>.P</b>.  Ninth Edition Research Unix (1986) introduced <b>.EX</b> and <b>.EE</b>.   SunOS  4.0  (1988)  added
       <b>.SB</b>.

       The  foregoing  features were what James Clark implemented in early versions of <u>groff</u>.  Later, <u>groff</u> 1.20
       (2009) originated <b>.SY</b>/<b>.YS</b>, <b>.TQ</b>, <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME</b>, and <b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE</b>.  Plan 9 from User Space's <u>troff</u> introduced  <b>.MR</b>  in
       2020.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       The  following <u>groff</u> options set registers (with <b>-r</b>) and strings (with <b>-d</b>) recognized and used by the <u>man</u>
       macro package.  To ensure rendering consistent with output device capabilities  and  reader  preferences,
       man pages should never manipulate them.

       <b>-dAD=</b><u>adjustment-mode</u>
              Set line adjustment to <u>adjustment-mode,</u> which is typically “<b>b</b>” for adjustment to both margins (the
              default),  or  “<b>l</b>”  for left alignment (ragged right margin).  Any valid argument to <u>groff</u>'s “.ad”
              request may be used.  See <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7) for less-common choices.

       <b>-rcR=1</b> Enable continuous rendering.  Output is not paginated; instead, one (potentially very  long)  page
              is  produced.   This  is  the  default for terminal and HTML devices.  Use <b>-rcR=0</b> to disable it on
              terminal devices; on HTML devices, it cannot be disabled.

       <b>-rC1</b>   Number output pages consecutively, in strictly increasing sequence, rather than resetting the page
              number to 1 (or the value of register <b>P</b>) with each new <u>man</u> document.

       <b>-rCS=1</b> Set section headings (the argument(s) to <b>.SH</b>) in full capitals.  This  transformation  is  off  by
              default because it discards case distinction information.

       <b>-rCT=1</b> Set  the man page topic (the first argument to <b>.TH</b>) in full capitals in headers and footers.  This
              transformation is off by default because it discards case distinction information.

       <b>-rD1</b>   Enable double-sided layout, formatting footers  for  even  and  odd  pages  differently;  see  the
              description of <b>.TH</b> in subsection “Document structure macros” above.

       <b>-rFT=</b><u>footer-distance</u>
              Set  distance  of the footer relative to the bottom of the page to <u>footer-distance;</u> this amount is
              always negative.  At one half-inch above this location, the page text is broken before writing the
              footer.  Ignored if continuous rendering is enabled.  The default is -0.5i.

       <b>-dHF=</b><u>heading-font</u>
              Set the font used for section and subsection headings; the default  is  “<b>B</b>”  (bold  style  of  the
              default family).  Any valid argument to <u>groff</u>'s “.ft” request may be used.  See <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7).

       <b>-rHY=0</b> Disable  automatic  hyphenation.  Normally, it is enabled (1).  The hyphenation mode is determined
              by the <u>groff</u> locale; see section “Localization“ of <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7).

       <b>-rIN=</b><u>standard-indentation</u>
              Set the amount of indentation used for ordinary paragraphs (<b>.P</b> and its synonyms) and  the  default
              indentation  amount used by <b>.IP</b>, <b>.RS</b>, <b>.TP</b>, and the deprecated <b>.HP</b>.  See subsection “Horizontal and
              vertical spacing” above for the default.  For terminal devices, <u>standard-indentation</u> should always
              be an integer multiple of unit “n” to get consistent indentation.

       <b>-rLL=</b><u>line-length</u>
              Set line length; the default is 78n for terminal devices and 6.5i for typesetting devices.

       <b>-rLT=</b><u>title-length</u>
              Set the line length for titles.  (“Titles” is the <u>roff</u> term for headers and footers.)  By default,
              it is set to the line length (see <b>-rLL</b> above).

       <b>-dMF=</b><u>man-page-topic-font</u>
              Set the font used for man page topics named in <b>.TH</b> and <b>.MR</b> calls; the default is “<b>I</b>” (italic style
              of the default family).  Any valid argument to <u>groff</u>'s “.ft” request  may  be  used.   If  the  <b>MF</b>
              string  ends  in  “I”, it is assumed to be an oblique typeface, and italic corrections are applied
              before and after man page topics.

       <b>-rP</b><u>n</u>   Start enumeration of pages at <u>n</u>.  The default is 1.

       <b>-rS</b><u>type-size</u>
              Use <u>type-size</u> for the document's body text; acceptable values are  10,  11,  or  12  points.   See
              subsection “Font style macros” above for the default.

       <b>-rSN=</b><u>subsection-indentation</u>
              Set  indentation of subsection headings to <u>subsection-indentation.</u>  See subsection “Horizontal and
              vertical spacing” above for the default.

       <b>-rU1</b>   Enable generation of URI hyperlinks in the <u>grohtml</u> and <u>grotty</u>  output  drivers.   <u>grohtml</u>  enables
              them  by  default;  <u>grotty</u>  does  not,  pending  more  widespread  pager  support for OSC 8 escape
              sequences.  Use <b>-rU0</b> to disable hyperlinks; this will make  the  arguments  to  <b>MT</b>  and  <b>UR</b>  calls
              visible in the document text produced by link-capable drivers.

       <b>-rX</b><u>p</u>   Number  successors of page <u>p</u> as <u>p</u>a, <u>p</u>b, <u>p</u>c, and so forth.  The register tracking the suffixed page
              letter uses format “a” (see the “.af” request in <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7)).  For example, the option <b>-rX2</b> produces
              the following page numbers: 1, 2, 2a, 2b, ..., 2aa, 2ab, and so on.

              This brief <u>groff</u> program detects whether the <u>man</u> or <u>mdoc</u> macro package is being used by a document
              and loads the correct macro definitions, taking advantage of the fact that pages using  them  must
              call  <b>.TH</b>  or  <b>.Dd</b>,  respectively,  before  any  other  macros.  A <u>man</u> program or user typing, for
              example, “<b>groff</b> <b>-mandoc</b> <b>page.1</b>”, need not know which package the file <u>page.1</u> uses.   Multiple  man
              pages, in either format, can be handled; <u>andoc</u> reloads each macro package as necessary.

              Except for <b>.SB</b>, definitions of macros described above as extensions are contained in this file; in
              some  cases, they are simpler versions of definitions appearing in <u>an.tmac</u>, and are ignored if the
              formatter is GNU <u>troff</u>.  They are written to  be  compatible  with  AT&amp;T  <u>troff</u>  and  permissively
              licensed—not  copylefted.   To reduce the risk of name space collisions, string and register names
              begin only with “<b>m</b>”<b>.</b>  We encourage man page authors who are concerned about portability to  legacy
              Unix  systems to copy these definitions into their pages, and maintainers of <u>troff</u> implementations
              or work-alike systems that format man pages to re-use them.

              The definitions for these macros are read after a page calls <b>.TH</b>, so they will replace any  macros
              of the same names preceding it in your file.  If you use your own implementations of these macros,
              they  must  be  defined after <b>.TH</b> is called to have any effect.  Furthermore, it is wise to define
              such page-local macros (if at all) after the “Name” section to  accommodate  timid  <u>makewhatis</u>  or
              <u>mandb</u> implementations that may give up their scan for indexing material early.

</pre><h4><b>Notes</b></h4><pre>
       Some tips on troubleshooting your man pages follow.

       • Some ASCII characters look funny or copy and paste wrong.
              On  devices  with  large glyph repertoires, like UTF-8-capable terminals and PDF, several keyboard
              glyphs are mapped to code points outside the  Unicode  basic  Latin  range  because  that  usually
              results  in  better  typography  in  the  general  case.   When documenting GNU/Linux command or C
              language syntax, however, this translation is sometimes not desirable.

              To get a “literal”...   ...should be input.
              ────────────────────────────────────────────
                                  <b>'</b>   <b>\(aq</b>
                                  <b>-</b>   <b>\-</b>
                                  <b>\</b>   <b>\(rs</b>
                                  <b>^</b>   <b>\(ha</b>
                                  <b>`</b>   <b>\(ga</b>
                                  <b>~</b>   <b>\(ti</b>
              ────────────────────────────────────────────

              Additionally, if a neutral double quote (") is needed in a macro argument, you can use <b>\(dq</b> to get
              it.  You should <u>not</u> use <b>\(aq</b> for an ordinary apostrophe (as in “can't”)  or  <b>\-</b>  for  an  ordinary
              hyphen (as in “word-aligned”).  Review subsection “Portability” above.

       • Do I ever need to use an empty macro argument ("")?
              Probably not.  When this seems necessary, often a shorter or clearer alternative is available.

                     Instead of...               ...should be considered.

              ...                            <b>.RE</b>
              ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
              <b>.B</b> <b>one</b> <b>two</b> <b>""</b> <b>three</b>            <b>.B</b> <b>one</b> <b>two</b> <b>three</b>

              In  the title heading (<b>.TH</b>), the date of the page's last revision is more important than packaging
              information; it should not be omitted.  Ideally, a page maintainer will keep both up to date.

              <b>.IP</b> is sometimes ill-understood and misused, especially when no  marker  argument  is  supplied—an
              indentation  argument  is not required.  By setting an explicit indentation, you may be overriding
              the reader's preference as set with the <b>-rIN</b> option.  If your page renders adequately without one,
              use the simpler form.  If you need to indent multiple (unmarked) paragraphs, consider  setting  an
              inset region with <b>.RS</b> and <b>.RE</b> instead.

              In  the  last  example,  the empty argument does have a subtly different effect than its suggested
              replacement: the empty argument causes an additional space character to  be  interpolated  between
              the  arguments “two” and “three”—but it is a regular breaking space, so it can be discarded at the
              end of an output line.  It is better not to be subtle,  particularly  with  space,  which  can  be
              overlooked in source and rendered forms.

       • <b>.RS</b> doesn't indent relative to my indented paragraph.
              The  <b>.RS</b>  macro sets the left margin; that is, the position at which an <u>ordinary</u> paragraph (<b>.P</b> and
              its synonyms) will be set.  <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, and the deprecated <b>.HP</b> use the same default indentation.  If
              not given an argument, <b>.RS</b> moves the left margin by this same amount.  To create an inset relative
              to an indented paragraph, call <b>.RS</b> repeatedly until an acceptable indentation is achieved, or give
              <b>.RS</b> an indentation argument that is at  least  as  much  as  the  paragraph's  indentation  amount
              relative  to an adjacent <b>.P</b> paragraph.  See subsection “Horizontal and vertical spacing” above for
              the values.

              Another approach you can use with tagged paragraphs is to place an <b>.RS</b> call immediately after  the
              paragraph tag; this will also force a break regardless of the width of the tag, which some authors
              prefer.   Follow-up  paragraphs under the tag can then be set with <b>.P</b> instead of <b>.IP</b>.  Remember to
              use <b>.RE</b> to end the indented region before starting the next tagged paragraph (at  the  appropriate
              nesting level).

       • <b>.RE</b> doesn't move the inset back to the expected level.
       • warning: scaling unit invalid in context
       • warning: register 'an-saved-margin<u>n</u>' not defined
       • warning: register 'an-saved-prevailing-indent<u>n</u>' not defined
              The  <b>.RS</b>  macro takes an <u>indentation</u> <u>amount</u> as an argument; the <b>.RE</b> macro's argument is a specific
              <u>inset</u> <u>level.</u>  <b>.RE</b> <b>1</b> goes to the level before any <b>.RS</b> macros were called, <b>.RE</b> <b>2</b> goes to  the  level
              of  the first <b>.RS</b> call you made, and so forth.  If you desire symmetry in your macro calls, simply
              issue one <b>.RE</b> without an argument for each <b>.RS</b> that precedes it.

              After calls to the <b>.SH</b> and <b>.SS</b> sectioning macros, all relative insets are cleared and calls to <b>.RE</b>
              have no effect until <b>.RS</b> is used again.

       • Do I need to keep typing the indentation in a series of <b>.IP</b> calls?
              Not if you don't want to change it.  Review subsection “Horizontal and vertical spacing” above.

                Instead of...     ...should be considered.

       • Why doesn't the package provide a string to insert an ellipsis?
              Examples of ellipsis usage  are  shown  above,  in  subsection  “Command  synopsis  macros”.   The
              idiomatic  <u>roff</u>  ellipsis  is  three dots (periods) with thin space escape sequences <b>\|</b> internally
              separating  them.   Since  dots  both  begin  control  lines  and  are  candidate  end-of-sentence
              characters,  however, it is sometimes necessary to prefix and/or suffix an ellipsis with the dummy
              character escape sequence <b>\&amp;</b>.  That fact stands even  if  a  string  is  defined  to  contain  the
              sequence;  further, if the string ends with <b>\&amp;</b>, end-of-sentence detection is defeated when you use
              the string at the end of an actual sentence.  (Ending a sentence with an ellipsis  is  often  poor
              style, but not always.)  A hypothetical string <b>EL</b> that contained an ellipsis, but not the trailing
              dummy character <b>\&amp;</b>, would then need to be suffixed with the latter when not ending a sentence.

                  Instead of...              ...do this.
              ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
              <b>.ds</b> <b>EL</b> <b>\&amp;.\|.\|.</b>         <b>Arguments</b> <b>are</b>
              <b>Arguments</b> <b>are</b>            <b>.IR</b> <b>src-file\~</b> <b>.\|.\|.\&amp;</b>
              <b>.IR</b> <b>src-file\~</b> <b>\*(EL\&amp;</b>   <b>.IR</b> <b>dest-dir</b> <b>.</b>
              <b>.IR</b> <b>dest-dir</b> <b>.</b>
              ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

              The  first  column  practices  a  false  economy;  the  savings in typing is offset by the cost of
              obscuring even the suggestion of an ellipsis to a  casual  reader  of  the  source  document,  and
              reduced portability to non-<u>roff</u> man page formatters that cannot handle string definitions.

              There  is an ellipsis code point in Unicode, and some fonts have an ellipsis glyph, which some man
              pages have accessed in a  non-portable  way  with  the  font-dependent  <b>\N</b>  escape  sequence.   We
              discourage  the  use  of  these; on terminals, they may crowd the dots into a half-width character
              cell, and will not render at all if the output device doesn't have the glyph.  In syntax synopses,
              missing ellipses can cause great confusion.  Dots and space are universally supported.

       The initial GNU implementation of the <u>man</u> macro package  was  written  by  James  Clark.   Later,  Werner
       Lemberg supplied the <b>S</b>, <b>LT</b>, and <b>cR</b> registers, the last a 4.3BSD-Reno <u><a href="../man7/mdoc.7.html">mdoc</a></u>(7) feature.  Larry Kollar added
       the  <b>FT</b>,  <b>HY</b>, and <b>SN</b> registers; the <b>HF</b> string; and the <b>PT</b> and <b>BT</b> macros.  G. Branden Robinson implemented
       the <b>AD</b> and <b>MF</b> strings; <b>CS</b>, <b>CT</b>, and <b>U</b> registers; and the <b>MR</b> macro.  Except for <b>.SB</b>, the  extension  macros
       were written by Lemberg, Eric S. Raymond, and Robinson.

       This  document  was  originally  written  for  the Debian GNU/Linux system by Susan G. Kleinmann.  It was
       corrected and updated by Lemberg and Robinson.  The extension  macros  were  documented  by  Raymond  and
       Robinson.   Raymond  also  originated the portability section, to which Ingo Schwarze contributed most of
       the material on escape sequences.
