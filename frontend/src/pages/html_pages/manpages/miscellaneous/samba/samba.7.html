</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       samba - A Windows AD and SMB/CIFS fileserver for UNIX

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       samba

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that implements the Server Message Block (commonly
       abbreviated as SMB) protocol for UNIX systems and provides Active Directory services. The first version
       of the SMB protocol is sometimes also referred to as the Common Internet File System (CIFS). For a more
       thorough description, see <a href="http://www.ubiqx.org/cifs/">http://www.ubiqx.org/cifs/</a>. Samba also implements the NetBIOS protocol in nmbd.

       <b><a href="../man8/samba.8.html">samba</a></b>(8)
           The samba daemon provides the Active Directory services and file and print services to SMB clients.
           The configuration file for this daemon is described in <b><a href="../man5/smb.conf.5.html">smb.conf</a></b>(5).

       <b><a href="../man8/smbd.8.html">smbd</a></b>(8)
           The smbd daemon provides the file and print services to SMB clients. The configuration file for this

       <b><a href="../man8/nmbd.8.html">nmbd</a></b>(8)
           The nmbd daemon provides NetBIOS nameservice and browsing support. The configuration file for this
           daemon is described in <b><a href="../man5/smb.conf.5.html">smb.conf</a></b>(5).

           The smbclient program implements a simple ftp-like client. This is useful for accessing SMB shares on
           other compatible SMB servers, and can also be used to allow a UNIX box to print to a printer attached
           to any SMB server.

</pre><h4><b>COMPONENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The Samba suite is made up of several components. Each component is described in a separate manual page.
       It is strongly recommended that you read the documentation that comes with Samba and the manual pages of
       those components that you use. If the manual pages and documents aren't clear enough then please visit
       https://devel.samba.org for information on how to file a bug report or submit a patch.

       If you require help, visit the Samba webpage at https://www.samba.org/ and explore the many option
       available to you.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The Samba software suite is licensed under the GNU Public License(GPL). A copy of that license should
       have come with the package in the file COPYING. You are encouraged to distribute copies of the Samba
       suite, but please obey the terms of this license.

       The latest version of the Samba suite can be obtained from https://download.samba.org/pub/samba/.

       The Samba Wiki at https://wiki.samba.org has also a lot of useful information. On the Samba mailing list
       at https://lists.samba.org you can find a lot of information in the archives and you can subscribe to the
       samba list and ask for help or discuss things.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This man page is part of version 4.22.3-Ubuntu-4.22.3+dfsg-4ubuntu1 of the Samba suite.

</pre><h4><b>CONTRIBUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If you wish to contribute to the Samba project, then I suggest you join the Samba mailing list at
       https://lists.samba.org.

       If you have patches to submit, visit https://devel.samba.org/ for information on how to do it properly.
       We prefer patches in git format-patch format.

</pre><h4><b>CONTRIBUTORS</b></h4><pre>
       Contributors to the project are now too numerous to mention here but all deserve the thanks of all Samba
       users. To see a full list, look at the change-log in the source package for the pre-CVS changes and at
       https://git.samba.org/ for the contributors to Samba post-GIT. GIT is the Open Source source code control
       system used by the Samba Team to develop Samba. The project would have been unmanageable without it.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
       by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
