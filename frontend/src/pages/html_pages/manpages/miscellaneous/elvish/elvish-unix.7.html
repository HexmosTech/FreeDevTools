</pre><h4><b>Introduction</b></h4><pre>
       The unix: module provides access to features that only make sense on UNIX-like operating systems, such as
       Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS.

       On  non-UNIX operating systems, such as MS Windows, this namespace does not exist and use unix will fail.
       Use the $platform:is-unix variable to determine if this namespace is usable.

</pre><h4><b>Variables</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$unix:umask</b> <b>{#unix:umask}</b>
       The file mode creation mask.  Its value is a string in Elvish octal representation;  e.g.   0o027.   This
       makes it possible to use it in any context that expects a $number.

       When  assigning  a  new value a string is implicitly treated as an octal number.  If that fails the usual
       rules for interpreting numbers are used.  The following are equivalent: unix:umask = 027 and unix:umask =
       0o27.  You can also assign to it a float64 data type that has no fractional component.  The assigned val‚Äê
       ue must be within the range [0 ... 0o777], otherwise the assignment will throw an exception.

       You can do a temporary assignment to affect a single command; e.g.  umask=077 touch  a_file.   After  the
       command  completes  the  old  umask  will  be  restored.   <b>Warning</b>: Since the umask applies to the entire
       process, not individual threads, changing it temporarily in this manner is dangerous  if  you  are  doing
       anything in parallel.  Such as via the peach command.
