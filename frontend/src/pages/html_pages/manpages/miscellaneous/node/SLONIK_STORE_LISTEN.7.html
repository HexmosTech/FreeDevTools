       STORE LISTEN - Configure Slony-I node to indicate where to listen for events

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>STORE</b> <b>LISTEN</b> <b>(options);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  ‘listen’  entry  causes  a node (receiver) to query an event provider for events that originate from a
       specific node, as well as confirmations from every existing node. It requires a ‘path’ to exist  so  that
       the receiver (as client) can connect to the provider (as server).

       Every node in the system must listen for events from every other node in the system. As a general rule of
       thumb,  a  subscriber  (see  <b>SLONIK</b> <b>SUBSCRIBE</b> <b><a href="../man7/SET.7.html">SET</a></b>(7)) should listen for events of the set's origin on the
       same provider, where it receives the data from. In turn, the origin of the data  set  should  listen  for
       events from the origin in the opposite direction. A node can listen for events from one and the same ori‐
       gin  on  different providers at the same time. However, to process <b>SYNC</b> events from that origin, all data
       providers must have the same or higher sync status, so this will not result in any faster replication be‐
       haviour.

       ORIGIN = ival
              Node ID of the event origin the receiver is listening for.

       PROVIDER = ival
              Node ID of the node from which the receiver gets events that come from the origin. If  not  speci‐
              fied, default is the origin.

       RECEIVER = ival
              The ID of the node receiving the events.

       This uses “schemadocstorelisten(p_receiver integer, p_provider integer, p_origin integer)” [not available
       as a man page].

       For more details, see “Slony-I Listen Paths” [not available as a man page].

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
            STORE LISTEN ( ORIGIN = 1, RECEIVER = 2, PROVIDER = 3 );

</pre><h4><b>LOCKING</b> <b>BEHAVIOUR</b></h4><pre>
       No application-visible locking should take place.

</pre><h4><b>SLONIK</b> <b>EVENT</b> <b>CONFIRMATION</b> <b>BEHAVIOUR</b></h4><pre>
       Slonik  waits for the command submitted to the previous event node to be confirmed on the specified event
       node before submitting this command.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       This command was introduced in Slony-I 1.0. As of version 1.1, you <u>should</u> no longer need to use this com‐
       mand, as listen paths are generated automatically.
