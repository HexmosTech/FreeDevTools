</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       go - tool for managing Go source code

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Go  path  is used to resolve import statements.  It is implemented by and documented in the go/build
       package.

       The GOPATH environment variable lists places to look for Go  code.   On  Unix,  the  value  is  a  colon-
       separated  string.   On  Windows,  the  value is a semicolon-separated string.  On Plan 9, the value is a
       list.

       If the environment variable is unset, GOPATH defaults to a subdirectory named "go"  in  the  user's  home
       directory  ($HOME/go  on  Unix, %USERPROFILE% on Windows), unless that directory holds a Go distribution.
       Run "go env GOPATH" to see the current GOPATH.

       See https://golang.org/wiki/SettingGOPATH to set a custom GOPATH.

       Each directory listed in GOPATH must have a prescribed structure:

       The src directory holds source code. The path below src determines the import path or executable name.

       The pkg directory holds installed package objects.  As in the Go tree, each target operating  system  and
       architecture pair has its own subdirectory of pkg (pkg/GOOS_GOARCH).

       If  DIR  is a directory listed in the GOPATH, a package with source in DIR/src/foo/bar can be imported as
       "foo/bar" and has its compiled form installed to "DIR/pkg/GOOS_GOARCH/foo/bar.a".

       The bin directory holds compiled commands.  Each command is named for its source directory, but only  the
       final  element,  not  the  entire path. That is, the command with source in DIR/src/foo/quux is installed
       into DIR/bin/quux, not DIR/bin/foo/quux. The "foo/" prefix is stripped so that you  can  add  DIR/bin  to
       your  PATH  to  get  at  the  installed  commands. If the GOBIN environment variable is set, commands are
       installed to the directory it names instead of DIR/bin. GOBIN must be an absolute path.

       Here's an example directory layout:

           GOPATH=/home/user/gocode

           /home/user/gocode/
               src/
                   foo/
                       bar/               (go code in package bar)
                           x.go
                       quux/              (go code in package main)
                           y.go
               bin/
                   quux                   (installed command)
               pkg/
                   linux_amd64/
                       foo/
                           bar.a          (installed package object)

       Go searches each directory listed in GOPATH to find source code, but new packages are  always  downloaded
       into the first directory in the list.

       See https://golang.org/doc/code.html for an example.

   <b>GOPATH</b> <b>and</b> <b>Modules</b>
       When  using  modules, GOPATH is no longer used for resolving imports.  However, it is still used to store
       downloaded source code (in GOPATH/pkg/mod) and compiled commands (in GOPATH/bin).

   <b>Internal</b> <b>Directories</b>
       Code in or below a directory named "internal" is importable only by code in the directory tree rooted  at
       the parent of "internal".  Here's an extended version of the directory layout above:

           /home/user/go/
               src/
                   crash/
                       bang/              (go code in package bang)
                           b.go
                   foo/                   (go code in package foo)
                       f.go
                       bar/               (go code in package bar)
                           x.go
                       internal/
                           baz/           (go code in package baz)
                               z.go
                       quux/              (go code in package main)
                           y.go

       The  code  in z.go is imported as "foo/internal/baz", but that import statement can only appear in source
       files in the subtree rooted at foo. The source files foo/f.go, foo/bar/x.go, and  foo/quux/y.go  can  all
       import "foo/internal/baz", but the source file crash/bang/b.go cannot.

       See https://golang.org/s/go14internal for details.

   <b>Vendor</b> <b>Directories</b>
       Go  1.6  includes  support  for  using  local copies of external dependencies to satisfy imports of those
       dependencies, often referred to as vendoring.

       Code below a directory named "vendor" is importable only by code in the  directory  tree  rooted  at  the
       parent  of  "vendor",  and only using an import path that omits the prefix up to and including the vendor
       element.

       Here's the example from the previous section, but with the "internal" directory renamed to "vendor" and a
       new foo/vendor/crash/bang directory added:

           /home/user/go/
               src/
                   crash/
                       bang/              (go code in package bang)
                           b.go
                   foo/                   (go code in package foo)
                       f.go
                       bar/               (go code in package bar)
                           x.go
                       vendor/
                           crash/
                               bang/      (go code in package bang)
                                   b.go
                           baz/           (go code in package baz)
                               z.go
                       quux/              (go code in package main)
                           y.go

       The same visibility rules apply as for internal, but the code in  z.go  is  imported  as  "baz",  not  as
       "foo/vendor/baz".

       Code  in  vendor  directories  deeper  in  the source tree shadows code in higher directories. Within the
       subtree rooted at foo, an import of "crash/bang" resolves to "foo/vendor/crash/bang", not  the  top-level
       "crash/bang".

       Code in vendor directories is not subject to import path checking (see 'go help importpath').

       When 'go get' checks out or updates a git repository, it now also updates submodules.

       Vendor  directories  do not affect the placement of new repositories being checked out for the first time
       by 'go get': those are always placed in the main GOPATH, never in a vendor subtree.

       See https://golang.org/s/go15vendor for details.
