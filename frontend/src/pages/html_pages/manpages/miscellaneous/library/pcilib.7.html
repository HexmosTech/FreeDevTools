</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pcilib - a library for accessing PCI devices

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  PCI  library  (also  known as <u>pcilib</u> and <u>libpci</u>) is a portable library for accessing PCI devices and
       their configuration space.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The library supports a variety of methods to  access  the  configuration  space  on  different  operating
       systems.  By  default,  the  first matching method in this list is used, but you can specify override the
       decision (see the <b>-A</b> switch of <u>lspci</u>).

       <b>linux-sysfs</b>
              The <b><a href="file:/sys">/sys</a></b> filesystem on Linux 2.6 and newer. The standard header of the config space  is  available
              to all users, the rest only to root. Supports extended configuration space, PCI domains, VPD (from
              Linux  2.6.26),  physical  slots  (also  since  Linux  2.6.26)  and information on attached kernel
              drivers.

       <b>linux-proc</b>
              The <b><a href="file:/proc/bus/pci">/proc/bus/pci</a></b> interface supported by Linux 2.1 and newer. The standard header  of  the  config
              space is available to all users, the rest only to root.

       <b>intel-conf1</b>
              Direct  hardware  access via Intel configuration mechanism 1. Available on i386 and compatibles on
              Linux, Solaris/x86, GNU Hurd, Windows, BeOS and Haiku. Requires root privileges.

       <b>intel-conf2</b>
              Direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 2. Available on i386 and  compatibles  on
              Linux,  Solaris/x86,  GNU  Hurd,  Windows, BeOS and Haiku. Requires root privileges. Warning: This
              method is able to address only the first 16 devices on any bus and it seems to be very  unreliable
              in many cases.

       <b>mmio-conf1</b>
              Direct  hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 1 via memory-mapped I/O.  Mostly used on
              non-i386 platforms. Requires root privileges. Warning: This method needs to be properly configured
              via the <b>mmio-conf1.addrs</b> parameter.

       <b>mmio-conf1-ext</b>
              Direct hardware access via Extended PCIe Intel configuration mechanism 1  via  memory-mapped  I/O.
              Mostly  used  on  non-i386  platforms.  Requires root privileges. Warning: This method needs to be
              properly configured via the <b>mmio-conf1-ext.addrs</b> parameter.

       <b>ecam</b>   Direct hardware access via PCIe ECAM (Enhanced Configuration Access Mechanism).  Available on  all
              PCIe-compliant  hardware. Requires root privileges and access to physical memory (on Linux systems
              disabled CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM option). On ACPI compatible systems is ECAM mapping  read  from  the
              MCFG  table  specified  by the <b>ecam.acpimcfg</b> parameter. On EFI compatible systems, ACPI MCFG table
              can be located in physical memory via EFI system table specified by the <b>ecam.efisystab</b>  parameter.
              On  FreeBSD/NetBSD  systems,  physical address of ACPI MCFG table can be located by kenv or sysctl
              interface when the <b>ecam.bsd</b> parameter is not disabled. On x86 BIOS compatible systems,  ACPI  MCFG
              table  can  be  located  in  physical  memory  by  scanning  x86 BIOS memory when the <b>ecam.x86bios</b>
              parameter is not disabled.  Alternatively  ECAM  mappings  can  be  specified  by  the  <b>ecam.addrs</b>
              parameter  which takes precedence over ACPI MCFG table. This option is required on systems without
              ACPI and also on systems without EFI or x86 BIOS.

       <b>fbsd-device</b>
              The <b>/dev/pci</b> device on FreeBSD. Requires root privileges.

       <b>aix-device</b>
              Access method used on AIX. Requires root privileges.

       <b>nbsd-libpci</b>
              The <b>/dev/pci0</b> device on NetBSD accessed using the local libpci library.

       <b>obsd-device</b>
              The <b>/dev/pci</b> device on OpenBSD. Requires root privileges.

       <b>dump</b>   Read the contents of configuration registers from a file specified in the <b>dump.name</b> parameter. The
              format corresponds to the output of <u>lspci</u> <b>-x</b>.

       <b>darwin</b> Access method used on Mac OS X / Darwin. Must be run as root and the system must have been  booted
              with debug=0x144.

       <b>win32-cfgmgr32</b>
              Device  listing on Windows systems using the Windows Configuration Manager via cfgmgr32.dll system
              library.  This  method  does  not  require  any  special  Administrator  rights   or   privileges.
              Configuration Manager provides only basic information about devices, assigned resources and device
              tree  structure.  There is no access to the PCI configuration space but libpci either tries to use
              other access method to access configuration space or it provides read-only virtual emulation based
              on  information  from  Configuration  Manager.  Other  access  method  can  be   chosen   by   the
              <b>win32.cfgmethod</b>  parameter.  By  default the first working one is selected (if any). Starting with
              Windows 8 (NT 6.2) it is not possible to retrieve resources from 32-bit application or library  on
              64-bit system.

       <b>win32-sysdbg</b>
              Access to the PCI configuration space via NT SysDbg interface on Windows systems. Process needs to
              have  Debug privilege, which local Administrators have by default. Not available on 64-bit systems
              and neither on recent 32-bit systems. Only devices from the first domain are accessible  and  only
              first 256 bytes of the PCI configuration space is accessible via this method.

       <b>win32-kldbg</b>
              Access  to the PCI configuration space via Kernel Local Debugging Driver kldbgdrv.sys. This driver
              is not part of the Windows system but is part of the Microsoft WinDbg tool. It is required to have
              kldbgdrv.sys driver installed in the system32 directory or to have windbg.exe or kd.exe binary  in
              PATH.   kldbgdrv.sys  driver  has  some  restrictions.  Process  needs to have Debug privilege and
              Windows system has to be booted with Debugging option. Debugging option can be enabled by  calling
              (takes effect after next boot): <b>bcdedit</b> <b>/debug</b> <b>on</b>

       <b>aos-expansion</b>
              Access method used on PowerPC Amiga running OS4+. Access is  made  through  Expansion.library.  It
              offers read and write access to configuration space.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The  library  is  controlled by several parameters. They should have sensible default values, but in case
       you want to do something unusual (or even something weird), you can override them (see the <b>-O</b>  switch  of
       <u>lspci</u>).
