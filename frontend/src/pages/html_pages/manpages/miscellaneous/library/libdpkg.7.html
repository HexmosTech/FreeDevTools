       libdpkg - Debian package manager C library

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>libdpkg</b> C library provides functions and infrastructure for the dpkg tool set, and external projects
       that need to integrate tightly with it.

       The library provides a <b><a href="../man1/pkgconf.1.html">pkgconf</a></b>(1) entry named <u>libdpkg</u>.

       <b>Warning</b>: The API provided by this library is highly volatile, still in the process of being cleaned up.
       It is only supposed to be used internally by dpkg for now. Header files, functions, variables and types
       might get renamed, removed or change semantics. If you still have a need to use it, which you would be
       doing anyway, say by locally building dpkg to get the library, then define the C preprocessor macro
       LIBDPKG_VOLATILE_API in your build to acknowledge that fact.

       Due to the currently API volatility, only a static library is provided.
