       LOAD - load a shared library file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       LOAD '<u>filename</u>'

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command loads a shared library file into the PostgreSQL server's address space. If the file has been
       loaded already, the command does nothing. Shared library files that contain C functions are automatically
       loaded whenever one of their functions is called. Therefore, an explicit <b>LOAD</b> is usually only needed to
       load a library that modifies the server's behavior through “hooks” rather than providing a set of
       functions.

       The library file name is typically given as just a bare file name, which is sought in the server's
       library search path (set by dynamic_library_path). Alternatively it can be given as a full path name. In
       either case the platform's standard shared library file name extension may be omitted. See
       Section 36.10.1 for more information on this topic.

       Non-superusers can only apply <b>LOAD</b> to library files located in $libdir/plugins/ — the specified <u>filename</u>
       must begin with exactly that string. (It is the database administrator's responsibility to ensure that
       only “safe” libraries are installed there.)

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>LOAD</b> is a PostgreSQL extension.
