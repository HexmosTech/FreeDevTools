       libc - overview of standard C libraries on Linux

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  term  “libc”  is  commonly  used  as  a shorthand for the “standard C library” a library of standard
       functions that can be used by all C programs (and sometimes by programs in other languages).  Because  of
       some history (see below), use of the term “libc” to refer to the standard C library is somewhat ambiguous
       on Linux.

   <b>glibc</b>
       By far the most widely used C library on Linux is the GNU C Library, often referred to as <u>glibc</u>.  This is
       the  C  library  that  is nowadays used in all major Linux distributions.  It is also the C library whose
       details are documented in the relevant pages of the <u>man-pages</u> project (primarily  in  Section  3  of  the
       manual).   Documentation  of  glibc is also available in the glibc manual, available via the command <u>info</u>
       <u>libc</u>.  Release 1.0 of glibc was made in September 1992.  (There were earlier  0.x  releases.)   The  next
       major release of glibc was 2.0, at the beginning of 1997.

       The  pathname  <u>/lib/libc.so.6</u>  (or  something  similar)  is  normally  a symbolic link that points to the
       location of the glibc  library,  and  executing  this  pathname  will  cause  glibc  to  display  various
       information about the version installed on your system.

   <b>Linux</b> <b>libc</b>
       In  the  early  to  mid  1990s,  there  was  for a while <u>Linux</u> <u>libc</u>, a fork of glibc 1.x created by Linux
       developers who felt that glibc development at the time was not sufficing for the needs of Linux.   Often,
       this  library  was referred to (ambiguously) as just “libc”.  Linux libc released major versions 2, 3, 4,
       and 5, as well as many minor versions of those releases.  Linux libc4 was the last  version  to  use  the
       a.out  binary  format, and the first version to provide (primitive) shared library support.  Linux libc 5
       was the first version to support the ELF binary format; this  version  used  the  shared  library  soname
       <u>libc.so.5</u>.  For a while, Linux libc was the standard C library in many Linux distributions.

       However,  notwithstanding  the  original  motivations of the Linux libc effort, by the time glibc 2.0 was
       released (in 1997), it was clearly superior to Linux libc, and all major  Linux  distributions  that  had
       been  using  Linux  libc  soon  switched back to glibc.  To avoid any confusion with Linux libc versions,
       glibc 2.0 and later used the shared library soname <u>libc.so.6</u>.

       Since the switch from Linux libc to glibc 2.0 occurred long  ago,  <u>man-pages</u>  no  longer  takes  care  to
       document Linux libc details.  Nevertheless, the history is visible in vestiges of information about Linux
       libc that remain in a few manual pages, in particular, references to <u>libc4</u> and <u>libc5</u>.

   <b>Other</b> <b>C</b> <b>libraries</b>
       There  are  various  other less widely used C libraries for Linux.  These libraries are generally smaller
       than glibc, both in terms of features and  memory  footprint,  and  often  intended  for  building  small
       binaries,  perhaps  targeted at development for embedded Linux systems.  Among such libraries are <u>uClibc</u>,
       <u>dietlibc</u>, and <u>musl</u> <u>libc</u>.  Details of these libraries are covered by the <u>man-pages</u> project, where they are
       known.
