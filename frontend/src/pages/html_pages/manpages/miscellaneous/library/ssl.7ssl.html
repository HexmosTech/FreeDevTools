</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ssl - OpenSSL SSL/TLS library

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       See the individual manual pages for details.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The OpenSSL <b>ssl</b> library implements several versions of the Secure Sockets Layer, Transport Layer
       Security, and Datagram Transport Layer Security protocols.  This page gives a brief overview of the
       extensive API and data types provided by the library.

       An <b>SSL_CTX</b> object is created as a framework to establish TLS/SSL enabled connections (see
       <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_new.3.html">SSL_CTX_new</a></b>(3)).  Various options regarding certificates, algorithms etc. can be set in this object.

       When a network connection has been created, it can be assigned to an <b>SSL</b> object. After the <b>SSL</b> object has
       been created using <b><a href="../man3/SSL_new.3.html">SSL_new</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/SSL_set_fd.3.html">SSL_set_fd</a></b>(3) or <b><a href="../man3/SSL_set_bio.3.html">SSL_set_bio</a></b>(3) can be used to associate the network
       connection with the object.

       When the TLS/SSL handshake is performed using <b><a href="../man3/SSL_accept.3.html">SSL_accept</a></b>(3) or <b><a href="../man3/SSL_connect.3.html">SSL_connect</a></b>(3) respectively.
       <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read_ex.3.html">SSL_read_ex</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read.3.html">SSL_read</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/SSL_write_ex.3.html">SSL_write_ex</a></b>(3) and <b><a href="../man3/SSL_write.3.html">SSL_write</a></b>(3) are used to read and write data on the
       TLS/SSL connection.  <b><a href="../man3/SSL_shutdown.3.html">SSL_shutdown</a></b>(3) can be used to shut down the TLS/SSL connection.

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>STRUCTURES</b></h4><pre>
       Here are some of the main data structures in the library.

       <b>SSL_METHOD</b> (SSL Method)
           This  is  a  dispatch structure describing the internal <b>ssl</b> library methods/functions which implement
           the various protocol versions (SSLv3 TLSv1, ...). It's needed to create an <b>SSL_CTX</b>.

       <b>SSL_CIPHER</b> (SSL Cipher)
           This structure holds the algorithm information for a particular cipher which are a core part  of  the
           SSL/TLS  protocol.  The  available ciphers are configured on a <b>SSL_CTX</b> basis and the actual ones used
           are then part of the <b>SSL_SESSION</b>.

       <b>SSL_CTX</b> (SSL Context)
           This is the global context structure which is created by a server or client once  per  program  life-
           time  and  which  holds  mainly default values for the <b>SSL</b> structures which are later created for the
           connections.

       <b>SSL_SESSION</b> (SSL Session)
           This is a structure containing the current TLS/SSL session details  for  a  connection:  <b>SSL_CIPHER</b>s,
           client and server certificates, keys, etc.

       <b>SSL</b> (SSL Connection)
           This is the main SSL/TLS structure which is created by a server or client per established connection.
           This  actually  is the core structure in the SSL API.  At run-time the application usually deals with
           this structure which has links to mostly all other structures.

</pre><h4><b>HEADER</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Currently the OpenSSL <b>ssl</b> library provides the following C header files containing the prototypes for the
       data structures and functions:

       <u>&lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;</u>
           This is the common header file for the SSL/TLS API.  Include it into your program to make the API  of
           the  <b>ssl</b> library available. It internally includes both more private SSL headers and headers from the
           <b>crypto</b> library.  Whenever you need hard-core details on the internals of the  SSL  API,  look  inside
           this header file.  This file also includes the others listed below.

       <u>&lt;openssl/ssl2.h&gt;</u>
           Unused. Present for backwards compatibility only.

       <u>&lt;openssl/ssl3.h&gt;</u>
           This is the sub header file dealing with the SSLv3 protocol only.

       <u>&lt;openssl/tls1.h&gt;</u>
           This is the sub header file dealing with the TLSv1 protocol only.
