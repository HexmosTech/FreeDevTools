       nptl - Native POSIX Threads Library

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       NPTL  (Native  POSIX  Threads  Library) is the GNU C library POSIX threads implementation that is used on
       modern Linux systems.

   <b>NPTL</b> <b>and</b> <b>signals</b>
       NPTL makes internal use of the first two real-time signals (signal numbers 32  and  33).   One  of  these
       signals  is  used to support thread cancelation and POSIX timers (see <b><a href="../man2/timer_create.2.html">timer_create</a></b>(2)); the other is used
       as part of a mechanism that ensures all threads in a process always have  the  same  UIDs  and  GIDs,  as
       required by POSIX.  These signals cannot be used in applications.

       To  prevent  accidental use of these signals in applications, which might interfere with the operation of
       the NPTL implementation, various glibc library functions and system call  wrapper  functions  attempt  to
       hide these signals from applications, as follows:

       •  <b>SIGRTMIN</b> is defined with the value 34 (rather than 32).

       •  The  <b><a href="../man2/sigwaitinfo.2.html">sigwaitinfo</a></b>(2),  <b><a href="../man2/sigtimedwait.2.html">sigtimedwait</a></b>(2),  and <b><a href="../man3/sigwait.3.html">sigwait</a></b>(3) interfaces silently ignore requests to wait for
          these two signals if they are specified in the signal set argument of these calls.

       •  The <b><a href="../man2/sigprocmask.2.html">sigprocmask</a></b>(2) and <b><a href="../man3/pthread_sigmask.3.html">pthread_sigmask</a></b>(3) interfaces silently  ignore  attempts  to  block  these  two
          signals.

       •  The  <b><a href="../man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction</a></b>(2),  <b><a href="../man3/pthread_kill.3.html">pthread_kill</a></b>(3),  and  <b><a href="../man3/pthread_sigqueue.3.html">pthread_sigqueue</a></b>(3)  interfaces  fail with the error <b>EINVAL</b>
          (indicating an invalid signal number) if these signals are specified.

       •  <b><a href="../man3/sigfillset.3.html">sigfillset</a></b>(3) does not include these two signals when it creates a full signal set.

   <b>NPTL</b> <b>and</b> <b>process</b> <b>credential</b> <b>changes</b>
       At the Linux kernel level, credentials (user and group IDs) are a per-thread attribute.   However,  POSIX
       requires  that  all  of  the  POSIX  threads in a process have the same credentials.  To accommodate this
       requirement, the NPTL implementation wraps all of the system calls that change process  credentials  with
       functions  that, in addition to invoking the underlying system call, arrange for all other threads in the
       process to also change their credentials.

       The implementation of each of these system calls involves the use of a  real-time  signal  that  is  sent
       (using  <b><a href="../man2/tgkill.2.html">tgkill</a></b>(2))  to  each of the other threads that must change its credentials.  Before sending these
       signals, the thread that is changing credentials saves the new credential(s) and records the system  call
       being  employed in a global buffer.  A signal handler in the receiving thread(s) fetches this information
       and then uses the same system call to change its credentials.

       Wrapper functions employing this technique are provided for <b><a href="../man2/setgid.2.html">setgid</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/setuid.2.html">setuid</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/setegid.2.html">setegid</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/seteuid.2.html">seteuid</a></b>(2),

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       For details of the conformance of NPTL to the POSIX standard, see <b><a href="../man7/pthreads.7.html">pthreads</a></b>(7).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX says that any thread in  any  process  with  access  to  the  memory  containing  a  process-shared
       (<b>PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED</b>)  mutex  can  operate  on  that mutex.  However, on 64-bit x86 systems, the mutex
       definition for x86-64 is incompatible with the mutex definition for i386, meaning that 32-bit and  64-bit
       binaries can't share mutexes on x86-64 systems.
