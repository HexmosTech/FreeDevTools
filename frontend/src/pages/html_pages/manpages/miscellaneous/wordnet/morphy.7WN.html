       morphy - discussion of WordNet's morphological processing

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Although only base forms of words are usually stored in WordNet, searches may be done on inflected forms.
       A set of morphology functions, Morphy, is applied to the search string to generate a form that is present
       in WordNet.

       Morphology  in  WordNet uses two types of processes to try to convert the string passed into one that can
       be found in the WordNet database.  There are lists of inflectional endings, based on syntactic  category,
       that  can  be detached from individual words in an attempt to find a form of the word that is in WordNet.
       There are also exception list files, one for each syntactic category, in which a search for an  inflected
       form  is  done.  Morphy tries to use these two processes in an intelligent manner to translate the string
       passed to the base form found in WordNet.  Morphy first checks for exceptions, then  uses  the  rules  of
       detachment.  The Morphy functions are not independent from WordNet. After each transformation, WordNet is
       searched for the resulting string in the syntactic category specified.

       The Morphy functions are passed a string and a syntactic category.  A string is either a single word or a
       collocation.   Since  some  words,  such  as <b>axes</b> can have more than one base form (<b>axe</b> and <b>axis</b>), Morphy
       works in the following manner.  The first time that Morphy is called with a specific string, it returns a
       base form.  For each subsequent call to Morphy made with a <b>NULL</b> string argument, Morphy  returns  another
       base  form.   Whenever  Morphy  cannot  perform a transformation, whether on the first call for a word or
       subsequent calls, <b>NULL</b> is returned.  A transformation to a valid English string will return <b>NULL</b>  if  the
       base form of the string is not in WordNet.

       The  morphological  functions  are found in the WordNet library.  See <b><a href="../man3WN/morph.3WN.html">morph</a></b>(3WN) for information on using
       these functions.

   <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Detachment</b>
       The following table shows the rules of detachment used by Morphy.   If  a  word  ends  with  one  of  the
       suffixes,  it  is stripped from the word and the corresponding ending is added.  Then WordNet is searched
       for the resulting string.  No rules are applicable to adverbs.

   <b>Exception</b> <b>Lists</b>
       There is one exception  list  file  for  each  syntactic  category.   The  exception  lists  contain  the
       morphological  transformations  for  strings that are not regular and therefore cannot be processed in an
       algorithmic manner.  Each line of an exception list contains an inflected form of a word or  collocation,
       followed  by  one or more base forms.  The list is kept in alphabetical order and a binary search is used
       to find words in these lists.  See <b><a href="../man5WN/wndb.5WN.html">wndb</a></b>(5WN) for information on the format of the exception list files.

   <b>Single</b> <b>Words</b>
       In general, single words are relatively easy to  process.   Morphy  first  looks  for  the  word  in  the
       exception  list.   If it is found the first base form is returned.  Subsequent calls with a <b>NULL</b> argument
       return additional base forms, if present.  A <b>NULL</b> is returned when there are no more base  forms  of  the
       word.

       If  the  word  is not found in the exception list corresponding to the syntactic category, an algorithmic
       process using the rules of detachment looks for a matching suffix.  If a  matching  suffix  is  found,  a
       corresponding  ending  is  applied  (sometimes  this  ending is a <b>NULL</b> string, so in effect the suffix is
       removed from the word), and WordNet is consulted to see if the resulting word is  found  in  the  desired
       part of speech.

   <b>Collocations</b>
       As  opposed  to  single  words, collocations can be quite difficult to transform into a base form that is
       present in WordNet.  In general, only base forms of words, even those comprising collocations, are stored
       in WordNet, such as <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b>.  Transforming the collocation <b>attorneys</b> <b>general</b> is  then  simply  a
       matter  of finding the base forms of the individual words comprising the collocation.  This usually works
       for nouns, therefore non-conforming nouns, such  as  <b>customs</b> <b>duty</b>  are  presently  entered  in  the  noun
       exception list.

       Verb  collocations  that  contain  prepositions,  such as <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b>, are more difficult.  As with single
       words, the exception list is searched first.  If the collocation is not found,  special  code  in  Morphy
       determines whether a verb collocation includes a preposition.  If it does, a function is called to try to
       find  the  base  form in the following manner.  It is assumed that the first word in the collocation is a
       verb and that the last word is a noun.  The algorithm then builds a search string with the base forms  of
       the verb and noun, leaving the remainder of the collocation (usually just the preposition, but more words
       may  be  involved)  in  the  middle.   For  example,  passed  <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b>, the database search would be
       performed with <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b>, which is found in WordNet, and therefore returned  from  Morphy.   If  a  verb
       collocation  does  not contain a preposition, then the base form of each word in the collocation is found
       and WordNet is searched for the resulting string.

   <b>Hyphenation</b>
       Hyphenation also presents special difficulties when searching WordNet.  It is often a subjective decision
       as to whether a word is hyphenated, joined as one word, or is a collocation of several words,  and  which
       of  the  various  forms are entered into WordNet.  When Morphy breaks a string into "words", it looks for
       both spaces and hyphens as delimiters.  It also looks for periods in strings and removes them if an exact
       match is not found.  A search for an abbreviation like <b>oct.</b> return the synset for <b>{</b> <b>October,</b> <b>Oct</b> <b>}</b>.   Not
       every  pattern of hyphenated and collocated string is searched for properly, so it may be advantageous to
       specify several search strings if the results of a search attempt seem incomplete.

   <b>Special</b> <b>Processing</b> <b>for</b> <b>nouns</b> <b>ending</b> <b>with</b> <b>'ful'</b>
       Morphy contains code that searches for nouns ending  with  <b>ful</b>  and  performs  a  transformation  on  the
       substring  preceeding  it.   It  then  appends  'ful'  back onto the resulting string and returns it. For
       example, if passed the nouns <b>boxesful</b>, it will return <b>boxful</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Since many noun collocations contains prepositions, such as <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b>,  an  algorithm  similar  to
       that  used  for  verbs  should  be  written  for  nouns.   In  the  present  scheme,  if Morphy is passed
       <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b>, the search string becomes <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b>, which is not in WordNet

       Morphy will allow non-words to be converted to words, if they follow one of the  rules  described  above.
       For example, it will happily convert <b>plantes</b> to <b>plants</b>.
