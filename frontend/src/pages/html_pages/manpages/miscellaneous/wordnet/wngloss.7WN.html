   <b>System</b> <b>Description</b>
       The  WordNet  system  consists  of  lexicographer files, code to convert these files into a database, and
       search routines and interfaces that display information  from  the  database.   The  lexicographer  files
       organize  nouns,  verbs,  adjectives  and adverbs into groups of synonyms, and describe relations between
       synonym groups.  <b><a href="../man1WN/grind.1WN.html">grind</a></b>(1WN) converts the lexicographer files into a database that encodes  the  relations
       between the synonym groups.  The different interfaces to the WordNet database utilize a common library of
       search routines to display these relations.  Note that the lexicographer files and <b><a href="../man1WN/grind.1WN.html">grind</a></b>(1WN) program are
       not generally distributed.

   <b>Database</b> <b>Organization</b>
       Information  in  WordNet is organized around logical groupings called synsets.  Each synset consists of a
       list of synonymous words or collocations (eg. <b>"fountain</b> <b>pen"</b>, <b>"take</b> <b>in"</b>), and pointers that describe  the
       relations  between  this  synset  and  other  synsets.  A word or collocation may appear in more than one
       synset, and in more than one part of speech.  The words in a  synset  are  grouped  such  that  they  are
       interchangeable in some context.

       Two kinds of relations are represented by pointers: lexical and semantic.  Lexical relations hold between
       semantically  related word forms; semantic relations hold between word meanings.  These relations include
       (but are not  limited  to)  hypernymy/hyponymy  (superordinate/subordinate),  antonymy,  entailment,  and
       meronymy/holonymy.

       Nouns  and verbs are organized into hierarchies based on the hypernymy/hyponymy relation between synsets.
       Additional pointers are be used to indicate other relations.

       Adjectives are arranged in clusters containing head synsets  and  satellite  synsets.   Each  cluster  is
       organized  around  antonymous  pairs  (and  occasionally  antonymous triplets).  The antonymous pairs (or
       triplets) are indicated in the head synsets of a cluster.  Most head synsets have one or  more  satellite
       synsets,  each of which represents a concept that is similar in meaning to the concept represented by the
       head synset.  One way to think of the adjective cluster organization is to visualize a wheel, with a head
       synset as the hub and satellite synsets as the spokes.  Two or more wheels are  logically  connected  via
       antonymy, which can be thought of as an axle between the wheels.

       Pertainyms  are  relational adjectives and do not follow the structure just described.  Pertainyms do not
       have antonyms; the synset for a pertainym most often contains only one word or collocation and a  lexical
       pointer  to the noun that the adjective is "pertaining to".  Participial adjectives have lexical pointers
       to the verbs that they are derived from.

       Adverbs are often derived from adjectives, and sometimes have  antonyms;  therefore  the  synset  for  an
       adverb usually contains a lexical pointer to the adjective from which it is derived.

       See <b><a href="../man5WN/wndb.5WN.html">wndb</a></b>(5WN) for a detailed description of the database files and how the data are represented.

</pre><h4><b>GLOSSARY</b> <b>OF</b> <b>TERMS</b></h4><pre>
       Many  terms  used  in the <u>WordNet</u> <u>Reference</u> <u>Manual</u> are unique to the WordNet system.  Other general terms
       have specific meanings when used in the WordNet documentation.  Definitions for many of these  terms  are
       given  to  help  with the interpretation and understanding of the reference manual, and in the use of the
       WordNet system.

       In following definitions <b>word</b> is used in place of <b>word</b> <b>or</b> <b>collocation</b>.

       <b>adjective</b> <b>cluster</b>        A group of adjective synsets that  are  organized  around  antonymous  pairs  or
                                triplets.   An  adjective  cluster  contains  two  or  more  <b>head</b>  <b>synsets</b> which
                                represent antonymous concepts.  Each head  synset  has  one  or  more  <b>satellite</b>
                                <b>synsets</b>.

       <b>attribute</b>                A  noun  for  which adjectives express values.  The noun <b>weight</b> is an attribute,
                                for which the adjectives <b>light</b> and <b>heavy</b> express values.

       <b>base</b> <b>form</b>                The base form of a word or collocation is the  form  to  which  inflections  are
                                added.

       <b>basic</b> <b>synset</b>             Syntactically,  same  as  <b>synset</b>.   Term is used in <b><a href="../man5WN/wninput.5WN.html">wninput</a></b>(5WN) to help explain
                                differences in entering synsets in lexicographer files.

       <b>collocation</b>              A collocation in WordNet is a string of two or more words, connected  by  spaces
                                or   hyphens.    Examples   are:   <b>man-eating</b> <b>shark</b>,   <b>blue-collar</b>,   <b>depend</b> <b>on</b>,
                                <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b>.  In the database files spaces are  represented  as  underscore
                                (<b>_</b>) characters.

       <b>coordinate</b>               Coordinate terms are nouns or verbs that have the same <b>hypernym</b>.

       <b>cross-cluster</b> <b>pointer</b>    A <b>semantic</b> <b>pointer</b> from one adjective cluster to another.

       <b>derivationally</b> <b>related</b> <b>forms</b>
                                Terms  in  different  syntactic  categories that have the same root form and are
                                semantically related.

       <b>direct</b> <b>antonyms</b>          A pair of words between which there is an associative bond resulting from  their
                                frequent  co-occurrence.  In <b>adjective</b> <b>clusters</b>, direct antonyms appears only in
                                <b>head</b> <b>synsets</b>.

       <b>domain</b>                   A topical classification to which a synset has  been  linked  with  a  CATEGORY,
                                REGION or USAGE pointer.

       <b>domain</b> <b>term</b>              A  synset  belonging to a topical class.  A domain term is further identified as
