</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following command line options are supported. Note that not all options are sensible for all clients.

       OPTIONS CONCERNING INPUT/OUTPUT FROM FILES

       <b>-I</b> <b>[filename]</b>
              read input from [filename] instead of stdin.

       OPTIONS CONCERNING OUTPUT OF INFORMATION

       <b>-h</b> <b>or</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print a usage message.

       <b>-d</b>     Debug.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose.

       <b>--heights</b>
              Output a height vector for every regular triangulation (implies <b>--regular</b>).

       <b>--flips</b>
              Output  all  flips  in  terms of IDs of adjacent triangulations. (Can be used to generate the flip
              graph.)

       <b>--asy</b>  Write asymptote graphics commands into file (in rank-3 triangulations, points are drawn as  well).
              The  graphics  contains  a  view of the point configuration (only in rank 3), the enumeration tree
              with a classification of enumeration nodes into  solutions,  non-canonical  nodes,  deadends,  and
              early  detected deadends, as well a statistics file showing a histogram of enumeration node types.
              The   output   file   has   to   be   processed   by   the   computer   graphics   compiler    asy
              (https://asymptote.sourceforge.io) using the asy-library Combinatorial_Geometry.asy and the LATEX-
              macroes in triangbook_macroes.sty inside share/asy/.

       OPTIONS FOR CHECKING INPUT

       <b>--checktriang</b>
              Check seed triangulation.

       OPTIONS FOR REPORTING PROPERTIES OF DISCOVERED TRIANGULATIONS

       <b>--flipdeficiency</b>
              Check triangulations for flip deficiency during flip-graph exploration.

       <b>--findregular</b> <b>[k]</b>
              Check every k-th triangulation for regularity and stop if a regular one is found during flip-graph
              exploration.

       OPTIONS CONCERNING WHICH TRIANGULATIONS ARE OUTPUT (NO INFLUENCE ON FLIP-GRAPH EXPLORATION)

       <b>--noorbitcount</b>
              Only count symmetry classes, not the total number.

       <b>--cardinality</b> <b>[k]</b>
              Count/output only triangulations with exactly k simplices.

       <b>--maxcardinality</b> <b>[k]</b>
              Count/oputput only triangulations with at most k simplices.

       <b>--unimodular</b>
              Output  unimodular  triangulations  only;  while  this  does  not  reduce the effort of flip graph
              exploration, since unimodular triangulations are in general not connected by themselves,  it  does
              reduce the effort of extension graph exploration linke in points2nalltriangs.

       <b>--nonregular</b>
              Output  non-regular  triangulations  only; note that this does not reduce the effort of flip-graph
              exploration, since non-regular triangulations are in general not connected by themselves.

       OPTIONS CONCERNING WHICH TRIANGULATIONS ARE EXPLORED

       <b>--regular</b>
              Search for  regular  triangulations  only  (checked  liftings  are  w.r.t.  the  last  homogeneous
              coordinate,  e.g.,  last  coordinates  all  ones is fine); note that this may reduce the effort of
              exploration, since regular triangulations are connected by themselves.

       <b>--noinsertion</b>
              Never flip-in a point that is unused in the seed triangulation.

       <b>--reducepoints</b>
              Try to greedily minimize the number of vertices used while flipping; keep a global upper bound  on
              the current minimal number of vertices and do not accept triangulations with more vertices.

       <b>--keepcard</b>
              Never change the cardinality of triangulations by flipping.

       OPTIONS CONCERNING SYMMETRIES

       <b>--affinesymmetries</b>
              Assume that the symmetries are affine, in particular, that they conserve regularity.

       <b>--isometricsymmetries</b>
              Assume that the symmetries are isometric, in particular, that they preserve volume.

       <b>--nosymmetries</b>

       <b>--usegkz</b>

              Use naive full traversal of all symmetries for symmetry handling.

       <b>--useswitchtables</b>
              Use Jordan-Joswig-Kastner switch tables for symmetry handling.

       <b>--usesymmetrytables</b>

              options.

       <b>--symtables</b> <b>[n]</b>
              Use [n] symtables for preprocessing symmetries.  Obsolete, since slower than the other options.

       <b>--preprocesschiro</b>
              Preprocess the chirotope (default for points2[n]alltriangs).

       <b>--preprocesspoints</b>
              Heuristically transform points (only relevant for (co)circuit enumeration).

       <b>--simpidxsymmetries</b>
              Preprocess  a  representation  of  the  symmetry  group  on  simplex  indices  (only  relevant for
              triangulation enumeration).

              symmetries).

       <b>--fullextensioncheck</b>
              Put more effort in the check of extendability of a partial triangulation.

       <b>--noextensioncheck</b>
              Skip the check of extendability of a partial triangulation.

       <b>--extensioncheckfirst</b>
              Check extendability prior to symmetry.

       <b>--preprocesspoints</b>
              Preprocess the coordinate matrix of the points (slightly useful for (co-)circuit enumeration)

       <b>--chirocache</b> <b>[n]</b>
              Set the chirotope cache to n elements.

              starving).
