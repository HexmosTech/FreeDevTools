       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/netinet/in.h">netinet/in.h</a>&gt;</b>

       <u>tcp6_socket</u> <b>=</b> <b>socket(AF_INET6,</b> <b>SOCK_STREAM,</b> <b>0);</b>
       <u>raw6_socket</u> <b>=</b> <b>socket(AF_INET6,</b> <b>SOCK_RAW,</b> <u>protocol</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Linux  2.2  optionally implements the Internet Protocol, version 6.  This man page contains a description
       of the IPv6 basic API as implemented by the Linux kernel and glibc 2.1.  The interface is  based  on  the
       BSD sockets interface; see <b><a href="../man7/socket.7.html">socket</a></b>(7).

       The  IPv6 API aims to be mostly compatible with the IPv4 API (see <b><a href="../man7/ip.7.html">ip</a></b>(7)).  Only differences are described
       in this man page.

       To bind an <b>AF_INET6</b> socket to any process, the local  address  should  be  copied  from  the  <u>in6addr_any</u>
       variable  which  has  <u>in6_addr</u> type.  In static initializations, <b>IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT</b> may also be used, which
       expands to a constant expression.  Both of them are in network byte order.

       The  IPv6  loopback  address  (::1)  is  available  in  the  global   <u>in6addr_loopback</u>   variable.    For
       initializations, <b>IN6ADDR_LOOPBACK_INIT</b> should be used.

       IPv4 connections can be handled with the v6 API by using the v4-mapped-on-v6 address type; thus a program
       needs  to  support  only  this  API type to support both protocols.  This is handled transparently by the
       address handling functions in the C library.

       IPv4 and IPv6 share the local port space.  When you get an IPv4 connection or packet to an  IPv6  socket,
       its source address will be mapped to v6.

   <b>Address</b> <b>format</b>
           struct sockaddr_in6 {
               sa_family_t     sin6_family;   /* AF_INET6 */
               in_port_t       sin6_port;     /* port number */
               uint32_t        sin6_flowinfo; /* IPv6 flow information */
               struct in6_addr sin6_addr;     /* IPv6 address */
               uint32_t        sin6_scope_id; /* Scope ID (new in Linux 2.4) */
           };

           struct in6_addr {
               unsigned char   s6_addr[16];   /* IPv6 address */
           };

       <u>sin6_family</u>  is  always  set  to  <b>AF_INET6</b>;  <u>sin6_port</u>  is  the  protocol  port  (see <u>sin_port</u> in <b><a href="../man7/ip.7.html">ip</a></b>(7));
       <u>sin6_flowinfo</u> is the IPv6 flow identifier; <u>sin6_addr</u> is the 128-bit IPv6 address.  <u>sin6_scope_id</u> is an ID
       depending on the scope of the address.  It is new in Linux 2.4.  Linux supports it  only  for  link-local
       addresses, in that case <u>sin6_scope_id</u> contains the interface index (see <b><a href="../man7/netdevice.7.html">netdevice</a></b>(7))

       IPv6  supports  several  address types: unicast to address a single host, multicast to address a group of
       hosts, anycast to address the nearest member of a group of hosts (not implemented in Linux), IPv4-on-IPv6
       to address an IPv4 host, and other reserved address types.

       The address notation for IPv6 is a group of 8 4-digit hexadecimal numbers, separated with  a  ':'.   "::"
       stands  for  a  string  of  0 bits.  Special addresses are ::1 for loopback and ::FFFF:&lt;IPv4 address&gt; for
       IPv4-mapped-on-IPv6.

       The port space of IPv6 is shared with IPv4.

   <b>Socket</b> <b>options</b>
       IPv6 supports some protocol-specific socket options that can be set  with  <b><a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt</a></b>(2)  and  read  with
       <b><a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</a></b>(2).  The socket option level for IPv6 is <b>IPPROTO_IPV6</b>.  A boolean integer flag is zero when it
       is false, otherwise true.

       <b>IPV6_ADDRFORM</b>
              Turn  an  <b>AF_INET6</b>  socket into a socket of a different address family.  Only <b>AF_INET</b> is currently
              supported for that.  It is allowed only for IPv6  sockets  that  are  connected  and  bound  to  a
              v4-mapped-on-v6  address.   The  argument  is a pointer to an integer containing <b>AF_INET</b>.  This is
              useful to pass v4-mapped sockets as file descriptors to programs that don't know how to deal  with
              the IPv6 API.

       <b>IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP,</b> <b>IPV6_DROP_MEMBERSHIP</b>
              Control membership in multicast groups.  Argument is a pointer to a <u>struct</u> <u>ipv6_mreq</u>.

       <b>IPV6_MTU</b>
              <b>getsockopt</b>():  Retrieve  the  current  known  path MTU of the current socket.  Valid only when the
              socket has been connected.  Returns an integer.

              <b>setsockopt</b>(): Set the MTU to be used for the socket.  The MTU is limited by the device MTU or  the
              path MTU when path MTU discovery is enabled.  Argument is a pointer to integer.

       <b>IPV6_MTU_DISCOVER</b>
              Control path-MTU discovery on the socket.  See <b>IP_MTU_DISCOVER</b> in <b><a href="../man7/ip.7.html">ip</a></b>(7) for details.

       <b>IPV6_MULTICAST_HOPS</b>
              Set the multicast hop limit for the socket.  Argument is a pointer to an integer.  -1 in the value
              means use the route default, otherwise it should be between 0 and 255.

       <b>IPV6_MULTICAST_IF</b>
              Set  the device for outgoing multicast packets on the socket.  This is allowed only for <b>SOCK_DGRAM</b>
              and <b>SOCK_RAW</b> socket.  The argument is a pointer to an interface index  (see  <b><a href="../man7/netdevice.7.html">netdevice</a></b>(7))  in  an
              integer.

       <b>IPV6_MULTICAST_LOOP</b>
              Control  whether the socket sees multicast packets that it has send itself.  Argument is a pointer
              to boolean.

       <b>IPV6_RECVPKTINFO</b> (since Linux 2.6.14)
              Set delivery of the <b>IPV6_PKTINFO</b> control message on incoming  datagrams.   Such  control  messages
              contain  a  <u>struct</u> <u>in6_pktinfo</u>, as per RFC 3542.  Allowed only for <b>SOCK_DGRAM</b> or <b>SOCK_RAW</b> sockets.
              Argument is a pointer to a boolean value in an integer.

       <b>IPV6_RTHDR,</b> <b>IPV6_AUTHHDR,</b> <b>IPV6_DSTOPTS,</b> <b>IPV6_HOPOPTS,</b> <b>IPV6_FLOWINFO,</b> <b>IPV6_HOPLIMIT</b>
              Set delivery of control messages for incoming datagrams  containing  extension  headers  from  the
              received packet.  <b>IPV6_RTHDR</b> delivers the routing header, <b>IPV6_AUTHHDR</b> delivers the authentication
              header,  <b>IPV6_DSTOPTS</b>  delivers  the  destination  options, <b>IPV6_HOPOPTS</b> delivers the hop options,
              <b>IPV6_FLOWINFO</b> delivers an integer containing  the  flow  ID,  <b>IPV6_HOPLIMIT</b>  delivers  an  integer
              containing  the  hop  count  of the packet.  The control messages have the same type as the socket
              option.  All these header options can also be set for outgoing packets by putting the  appropriate
              control  message  into  the control buffer of <b><a href="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg</a></b>(2).  Allowed only for <b>SOCK_DGRAM</b> or <b>SOCK_RAW</b>
              sockets.  Argument is a pointer to a boolean value.

       <b>IPV6_RECVERR</b>
              Control receiving of asynchronous error options.  See <b>IP_RECVERR</b> in <b><a href="../man7/ip.7.html">ip</a></b>(7) for  details.   Argument
              is a pointer to boolean.

       <b>IPV6_ROUTER_ALERT</b>
              Pass  forwarded  packets containing a router alert hop-by-hop option to this socket.  Allowed only
              for <b>SOCK_RAW</b> sockets.  The tapped packets are not forwarded  by  the  kernel,  it  is  the  user's
              responsibility  to  send them out again.  Argument is a pointer to an integer.  A positive integer
              indicates a router alert option value to intercept.  Packets carrying a router alert option with a
              value field containing this integer will be delivered to the socket.  A negative integer  disables
              delivery of packets with router alert options to this socket.

       <b>IPV6_UNICAST_HOPS</b>
              Set  the  unicast hop limit for the socket.  Argument is a pointer to an integer.  -1 in the value
              means use the route default, otherwise it should be between 0 and 255.

       <b>IPV6_V6ONLY</b> (since Linux 2.4.21 and 2.6)
              If this flag is set to true (nonzero), then the socket is restricted to sending and receiving IPv6
              packets only.  In this case, an IPv4 and an IPv6 application can bind to a single port at the same
              time.

              If this flag is set to false (zero), then the socket can be used to send and  receive  packets  to
              and from an IPv6 address or an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.

              The argument is a pointer to a boolean value in an integer.

              The    default    value   for   this   flag   is   defined   by   the   contents   of   the   file
              <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/net/ipv6/bindv6only">/proc/sys/net/ipv6/bindv6only</a></u>.  The default value for that file is 0 (false).

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ENODEV</b> The user tried to <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2) to a link-local IPv6 address, but  the  <u>sin6_scope_id</u>  in  the  supplied
              <u>sockaddr_in6</u> structure is not a valid interface index.

</pre><h4><b>VERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Linux 2.4 will break binary compatibility for the <u>sockaddr_in6</u> for 64-bit hosts by changing the alignment
       of  <u>in6_addr</u>  and adding an additional <u>sin6_scope_id</u> field.  The kernel interfaces stay compatible, but a
       program including <u>sockaddr_in6</u> or <u>in6_addr</u> into other structures may not be.  This is not a  problem  for
       32-bit hosts like i386.

       The  <u>sin6_flowinfo</u>  field  is  new  in Linux 2.4.  It is transparently passed/read by the kernel when the
       passed address length contains it.  Some programs that pass a longer address buffer and  then  check  the
       outgoing address length may break.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>sockaddr_in6</u>  structure  is bigger than the generic <u>sockaddr</u>.  Programs that assume that all address
       types can be stored safely in a <u>struct</u> <u>sockaddr</u> need to be changed to  use  <u>struct</u>  <u>sockaddr_storage</u>  for
       that instead.

       <b>SOL_IP</b>,  <b>SOL_IPV6</b>, <b>SOL_ICMPV6</b>, and other <b>SOL_*</b> socket options are nonportable variants of <b>IPPROTO_*</b>.  See
       also <b><a href="../man7/ip.7.html">ip</a></b>(7).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The IPv6 extended API as in RFC 2292 is currently only partly implemented; although the  2.2  kernel  has
       near  complete support for receiving options, the macros for generating IPv6 options are missing in glibc
       2.1.

       IPSec support for EH and AH headers is missing.

       Flow label management is not complete and not documented here.

       This man page is not complete.
