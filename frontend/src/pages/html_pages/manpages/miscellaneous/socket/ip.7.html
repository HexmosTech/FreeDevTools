</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Linux  implements  the  Internet  Protocol,  version 4, described in RFC 791 and RFC 1122.  <b>ip</b> contains a
       level 2 multicasting implementation conforming to RFC 1112.  It also contains an IP  router  including  a
       packet filter.

       The programming interface is BSD-sockets compatible.  For more information on sockets, see <b><a href="../man7/socket.7.html">socket</a></b>(7).

       An IP socket is created using <b><a href="../man2/socket.2.html">socket</a></b>(2):

           socket(AF_INET, socket_type, protocol);

       Valid socket types include <b>SOCK_STREAM</b> to open a stream socket, <b>SOCK_DGRAM</b> to open a datagram socket, and
       <b>SOCK_RAW</b> to open a <b><a href="../man7/raw.7.html">raw</a></b>(7) socket to access the IP protocol directly.

       <u>protocol</u> is the IP protocol in the IP header to be received or sent.  Valid values for <u>protocol</u> include:

       •  0 and <b>IPPROTO_TCP</b> for <b><a href="../man7/tcp.7.html">tcp</a></b>(7) stream sockets;

       •  0 and <b>IPPROTO_UDP</b> for <b><a href="../man7/udp.7.html">udp</a></b>(7) datagram sockets;

       •  <b>IPPROTO_SCTP</b> for <b><a href="../man7/sctp.7.html">sctp</a></b>(7) stream sockets; and

       •  <b>IPPROTO_UDPLITE</b> for <b><a href="../man7/udplite.7.html">udplite</a></b>(7) datagram sockets.

       For <b>SOCK_RAW</b> you may specify a valid IANA IP protocol defined in RFC 1700 assigned numbers.

       When  a  process wants to receive new incoming packets or connections, it should bind a socket to a local
       interface address using <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2).  In this case, only one IP socket  may  be  bound  to  any  given  local
       (address,  port)  pair.   When  <b>INADDR_ANY</b> is specified in the bind call, the socket will be bound to <u>all</u>
       local interfaces.  When <b><a href="../man2/listen.2.html">listen</a></b>(2) is called on an unbound socket, the socket is automatically bound to  a
       random  free  port  with  the  local  address set to <b>INADDR_ANY</b>.  When <b><a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</a></b>(2) is called on an unbound
       socket, the socket is automatically bound to a random free port or to a usable shared port with the local
       address set to <b>INADDR_ANY</b>.

       A TCP local socket address that has been bound is unavailable for some time  after  closing,  unless  the
       <b>SO_REUSEADDR</b> flag has been set.  Care should be taken when using this flag as it makes TCP less reliable.

   <b>Address</b> <b>format</b>
       An  IP  socket  address  is defined as a combination of an IP interface address and a 16-bit port number.
       The basic IP protocol does not supply port numbers, they are implemented by higher level  protocols  like
       <b><a href="../man7/udp.7.html">udp</a></b>(7) and <b><a href="../man7/tcp.7.html">tcp</a></b>(7).  On raw sockets <u>sin_port</u> is set to the IP protocol.

           struct sockaddr_in {
               sa_family_t    sin_family; /* address family: AF_INET */
               in_port_t      sin_port;   /* port in network byte order */
               struct in_addr sin_addr;   /* internet address */
           };

           /* Internet address */
           struct in_addr {
               uint32_t       s_addr;     /* address in network byte order */
           };

       <u>sin_family</u>  is  always  set  to <b>AF_INET</b>.  This is required; in Linux 2.2 most networking functions return
       <b>EINVAL</b> when this setting is missing.  <u>sin_port</u> contains the port in network byte order.  The port numbers
       below 1024 are called <u>privileged</u> <u>ports</u> (or sometimes: <u>reserved</u> <u>ports</u>).  Only  a  privileged  process  (on
       Linux: a process that has the <b>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</b> capability in the user namespace governing its network
       namespace)  may  <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2)  to  these sockets.  Note that the raw IPv4 protocol as such has no concept of a
       port, they are implemented only by higher protocols like <b><a href="../man7/tcp.7.html">tcp</a></b>(7) and <b><a href="../man7/udp.7.html">udp</a></b>(7).

       <u>sin_addr</u> is the IP host address.  The <u>s_addr</u> member of <u>struct</u> <u>in_addr</u> contains the host interface address
       in network byte order.  <u>in_addr</u> should be assigned one of the  <b>INADDR_*</b>  values  (e.g.,  <b>INADDR_LOOPBACK</b>)
       using  <b><a href="../man3/htonl.3.html">htonl</a></b>(3)  or  set  using  the  <b><a href="../man3/inet_aton.3.html">inet_aton</a></b>(3),  <b><a href="../man3/inet_addr.3.html">inet_addr</a></b>(3),  <b><a href="../man3/inet_makeaddr.3.html">inet_makeaddr</a></b>(3) library functions or
       directly with the name resolver (see <b><a href="../man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname</a></b>(3)).

       IPv4 addresses are divided into unicast, broadcast, and multicast addresses.  Unicast addresses specify a
       single interface of a host, broadcast addresses specify all hosts on a network, and  multicast  addresses
       address  all  hosts  in a multicast group.  Datagrams to broadcast addresses can be sent or received only
       when the <b>SO_BROADCAST</b> socket flag is set.  In the current implementation, connection-oriented sockets are
       allowed to use only unicast addresses.

       Note that the address and the port are always stored in network byte order.  In  particular,  this  means
       that  you  need to call <b><a href="../man3/htons.3.html">htons</a></b>(3) on the number that is assigned to a port.  All address/port manipulation
       functions in the standard library work in network byte order.

   <b>Special</b> <b>and</b> <b>reserved</b> <b>addresses</b>
       There are several special addresses:

       <b>INADDR_LOOPBACK</b> (127.0.0.1)
              always refers to the local host via the loopback device;

       <b>INADDR_ANY</b> (0.0.0.0)
              means any address for socket binding;

       <b>INADDR_BROADCAST</b> (255.255.255.255)
              has the same effect on <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2) as <b>INADDR_ANY</b>  for  historical  reasons.   A  packet  addressed  to
              <b>INADDR_BROADCAST</b> through a socket which has <b>SO_BROADCAST</b> set will be broadcast to all hosts on the
              local network segment, as long as the link is broadcast-capable.

       Highest-numbered address
       Lowest-numbered address
              On  any  locally-attached  non-point-to-point IP subnet with a link type that supports broadcasts,
              the highest-numbered address (e.g., the .255 address on a subnet with  netmask  255.255.255.0)  is
              designated as a broadcast address.  It cannot usefully be assigned to an individual interface, and
              can  only  be  addressed  with  a  socket on which the <b>SO_BROADCAST</b> option has been set.  Internet
              standards have historically also reserved the lowest-numbered address (e.g., the .0 address  on  a
              subnet with netmask 255.255.255.0) for broadcast, though they call it "obsolete" for this purpose.
              (Some sources also refer to this as the "network address.")  Since Linux 5.14, it is treated as an
              ordinary unicast address and can be assigned to an interface.

       Internet  standards  have traditionally also reserved various addresses for particular uses, though Linux
       no longer treats some of these specially.

       [0.0.0.1, 0.255.255.255]
       [240.0.0.0, 255.255.255.254]
              Addresses in these ranges (0/8 and 240/4) are  reserved  globally.   Since  Linux  5.3  and  Linux
              2.6.25, respectively, the 0/8 and 240/4 addresses, other than <b>INADDR_ANY</b> and <b>INADDR_BROADCAST</b>, are
              treated  as  ordinary  unicast  addresses.   Systems that follow the traditional behaviors may not
              interoperate with these historically reserved addresses.

       [127.0.0.1, 127.255.255.254]
              Addresses in this range (127/8) are treated as loopback addresses akin to the  standardized  local
              loopback address <b>INADDR_LOOPBACK</b> (127.0.0.1);

       [224.0.0.0, 239.255.255.255]
              Addresses in this range (224/4) are dedicated to multicast use.

   <b>Socket</b> <b>options</b>
       IP  supports  some  protocol-specific  socket  options  that  can be set with <b><a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt</a></b>(2) and read with
       <b><a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</a></b>(2).  The socket option level for IP is <b>IPPROTO_IP</b>.  A boolean integer flag is zero when it  is
       false, otherwise true.

       When  an  invalid  socket  option  is  specified,  <b><a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</a></b>(2)  and  <b><a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt</a></b>(2)  fail with the error
       <b>ENOPROTOOPT</b>.

       <b>IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</b> (since Linux 1.2)
              Join a multicast group.  Argument is an <u>ip_mreqn</u> structure.

                  struct ip_mreqn {
                      struct in_addr imr_multiaddr; /* IP multicast group
                                                       address */
                      struct in_addr imr_address;   /* IP address of local
                                                       interface */
                      int            imr_ifindex;   /* interface index */
                  };

              <u>imr_multiaddr</u> contains the address of the multicast group the application wants to join or  leave.
              It  must be a valid multicast address (or <b><a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt</a></b>(2) fails with the error <b>EINVAL</b>).  <u>imr_address</u>
              is the address of the local interface with which the system should join the multicast group; if it
              is equal to <b>INADDR_ANY</b>, an appropriate interface is chosen by  the  system.   <u>imr_ifindex</u>  is  the
              interface  index of the interface that should join/leave the <u>imr_multiaddr</u> group, or 0 to indicate
              any interface.

              The <u>ip_mreqn</u> structure is available only since Linux 2.2.   For  compatibility,  the  old  <u>ip_mreq</u>
              structure  (present  since  Linux  1.2)  is  still supported; it differs from <u>ip_mreqn</u> only by not
              including the <u>imr_ifindex</u> field.  (The kernel determines which structure is being passed based  on
              the size passed in <u>optlen</u>.)

              <b>IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</b> is valid only for <b><a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt</a></b>(2).

       <b>IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP</b> (since Linux 2.4.22 / Linux 2.5.68)
              Join  a  multicast  group  and  allow receiving data only from a specified source.  Argument is an
              <u>ip_mreq_source</u> structure.

                  struct ip_mreq_source {
                      struct in_addr imr_multiaddr;  /* IP multicast group
                                                        address */
                      struct in_addr imr_interface;  /* IP address of local
                                                        interface */
                      struct in_addr imr_sourceaddr; /* IP address of
                                                        multicast source */
                  };

              The <u>ip_mreq_source</u> structure is  similar  to  <u>ip_mreqn</u>  described  under  <b>IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</b>.   The
              <u>imr_multiaddr</u>  field  contains the address of the multicast group the application wants to join or
              leave.  The <u>imr_interface</u> field is the address of the local interface with which the system should
              join the multicast group.  Finally, the <u>imr_sourceaddr</u> field contains the address  of  the  source
              the application wants to receive data from.

              This option can be used multiple times to allow receiving data from more than one source.

       <b>IP_BIND_ADDRESS_NO_PORT</b> (since Linux 4.2)
              Inform  the  kernel  to  not reserve an ephemeral port when using <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2) with a port number of 0.
              The port will later be automatically chosen at <b><a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</a></b>(2) time, in a way  that  allows  sharing  a
              source port as long as the 4-tuple is unique.

       <b>IP_BLOCK_SOURCE</b> (since Linux 2.4.22 / 2.5.68)
              Stop  receiving  multicast data from a specific source in a given group.  This is valid only after
              the  application  has  subscribed  to  the  multicast  group  using  either  <b>IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</b>  or
              <b>IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP</b>.

              Argument is an <u>ip_mreq_source</u> structure as described under <b>IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP</b>.

       <b>IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP</b> (since Linux 1.2)
              Leave   a   multicast   group.    Argument   is  an  <u>ip_mreqn</u>  or  <u>ip_mreq</u>  structure  similar  to
              <b>IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</b>.

       <b>IP_DROP_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP</b> (since Linux 2.4.22 / 2.5.68)
              Leave a source-specific group—that is, stop receiving data from a given multicast group that  come
              from a given source.  If the application has subscribed to multiple sources within the same group,
              data  from the remaining sources will still be delivered.  To stop receiving data from all sources
              at once, use <b>IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP</b>.

              Argument is an <u>ip_mreq_source</u> structure as described under <b>IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP</b>.

       <b>IP_FREEBIND</b> (since Linux 2.4)
              If enabled, this boolean option allows binding to an IP address that is nonlocal or does not (yet)
              exist.  This permits listening on a socket, without requiring the underlying network interface  or
              the  specified  dynamic  IP address to be up at the time that the application is trying to bind to
              it.  This option is the per-socket equivalent of the <u>ip_nonlocal_bind</u>  <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u>  interface  described
              below.

       <b>IP_HDRINCL</b> (since Linux 2.0)
              If  enabled,  the  user  supplies an IP header in front of the user data.  Valid only for <b>SOCK_RAW</b>
              sockets; see <b><a href="../man7/raw.7.html">raw</a></b>(7) for  more  information.   When  this  flag  is  enabled,  the  values  set  by
              <b>IP_OPTIONS</b>, <b>IP_TTL</b>, and <b>IP_TOS</b> are ignored.

       <b>IP_LOCAL_PORT_RANGE</b> (since Linux 6.3)
              Set  or  get  the  per-socket default local port range.  This option can be used to clamp down the
              global local port range, defined by the <u>ip_local_port_range</u> <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u> interface described below, for a
              given socket.

              The option takes an <u>uint32_t</u> value with the high 16 bits set to the upper range bound, and the low
              16 bits set to the lower range bound.  Range bounds are inclusive.  The 16-bit values should be in
              host byte order.

              The lower bound has to be less than the upper bound when both bounds  are  not  zero.   Otherwise,
              setting the option fails with EINVAL.

              If  either  bound  is  outside  of the global local port range, or is zero, then that bound has no
              effect.

              To reset the setting, pass zero as both the upper and the lower bound.

       <b>IP_MSFILTER</b> (since Linux 2.4.22 / 2.5.68)
              This option provides access to the advanced full-state filtering API.  Argument is an  <u>ip_msfilter</u>
              structure.

                  struct ip_msfilter {
                      struct in_addr imsf_multiaddr; /* IP multicast group
                                                        address */
                      struct in_addr imsf_interface; /* IP address of local
                                                        interface */
                      uint32_t       imsf_fmode;     /* Filter-mode */

                      uint32_t       imsf_numsrc;    /* Number of sources in
                                                        the following array */
                      struct in_addr imsf_slist[1];  /* Array of source
                                                        addresses */
                  };

              There  are two macros, <b>MCAST_INCLUDE</b> and <b>MCAST_EXCLUDE</b>, which can be used to specify the filtering
              mode.  Additionally, the <b>IP_MSFILTER_SIZE</b>(n) macro exists to determine how much memory  is  needed
              to store <u>ip_msfilter</u> structure with <u>n</u> sources in the source list.

              For the full description of multicast source filtering refer to RFC 3376.

       <b>IP_MTU</b> (since Linux 2.2)
              Retrieve the current known path MTU of the current socket.  Returns an integer.

              <b>IP_MTU</b>  is  valid  only  for  <b><a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</a></b>(2)  and  can  be  employed  only when the socket has been
              connected.

       <b>IP_MTU_DISCOVER</b> (since Linux 2.2)
              Set or receive the Path MTU Discovery setting for a socket.  When enabled, Linux will perform Path
              MTU Discovery as defined  in  RFC 1191  on  <b>SOCK_STREAM</b>  sockets.   For  non-<b>SOCK_STREAM</b>  sockets,
              <b>IP_PMTUDISC_DO</b> forces the don't-fragment flag to be set on all outgoing packets.  It is the user's
              responsibility  to  packetize the data in MTU-sized chunks and to do the retransmits if necessary.
              The kernel will reject (with <b>EMSGSIZE</b>)  datagrams  that  are  bigger  than  the  known  path  MTU.
              <b>IP_PMTUDISC_WANT</b>  will  fragment  a  datagram if needed according to the path MTU, or will set the
              don't-fragment flag otherwise.

              The system-wide default can be toggled between <b>IP_PMTUDISC_WANT</b> and  <b>IP_PMTUDISC_DONT</b>  by  writing
              (respectively, zero and nonzero values) to the <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc">/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc</a></u> file.
              Path MTU discovery value   Meaning
              IP_PMTUDISC_WANT           Use per-route settings.
              IP_PMTUDISC_DONT           Never do Path MTU Discovery.
              IP_PMTUDISC_DO             Always do Path MTU Discovery.
              IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE          Set DF but ignore Path MTU.

              When  PMTU  discovery  is  enabled,  the  kernel  automatically  keeps  track  of the path MTU per
              destination host.  When it is connected to a specific peer with <b><a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</a></b>(2),  the  currently  known
              path  MTU  can  be  retrieved conveniently using the <b>IP_MTU</b> socket option (e.g., after an <b>EMSGSIZE</b>
              error occurred).  The path MTU may  change  over  time.   For  connectionless  sockets  with  many
              destinations,  the new MTU for a given destination can also be accessed using the error queue (see
              <b>IP_RECVERR</b>).  A new error will be queued for every incoming MTU update.

              While MTU discovery is in  progress,  initial  packets  from  datagram  sockets  may  be  dropped.
              Applications  using  UDP  should  be  aware  of this and not take it into account for their packet
              retransmit strategy.

              To bootstrap the path MTU discovery process on unconnected sockets, it is possible to start with a
              big datagram size (headers up to 64 kilobytes long) and let it shrink by updates of the path MTU.

              To get an initial estimate of the path MTU, connect a datagram socket to the  destination  address
              using <b><a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</a></b>(2) and retrieve the MTU by calling <b><a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</a></b>(2) with the <b>IP_MTU</b> option.

              It  is possible to implement RFC 4821 MTU probing with <b>SOCK_DGRAM</b> or <b>SOCK_RAW</b> sockets by setting a
              value of <b>IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE</b> (available since Linux 2.6.22).  This is also particularly  useful  for
              diagnostic tools such as <b><a href="../man8/tracepath.8.html">tracepath</a></b>(8) that wish to deliberately send probe packets larger than the
              observed Path MTU.

       <b>IP_MULTICAST_ALL</b> (since Linux 2.6.31)
              This  option  can  be used to modify the delivery policy of multicast messages.  The argument is a
              boolean integer (defaults to 1).  If set to 1, the socket  will  receive  messages  from  all  the
              groups  that  have  been joined globally on the whole system.  Otherwise, it will deliver messages
              only from the groups that have been explicitly  joined  (for  example  via  the  <b>IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</b>
              option) on this particular socket.

       <b>IP_MULTICAST_IF</b> (since Linux 1.2)
              Set  the  local  device  for a multicast socket.  The argument for <b><a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt</a></b>(2) is an <u>ip_mreqn</u> or
              (since Linux 3.5) <u>ip_mreq</u> structure similar to <b>IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</b>, or an <u>in_addr</u>  structure.   (The
              kernel  determines  which  structure  is  being  passed  based on the size passed in <u>optlen</u>.)  For
              <b><a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</a></b>(2), the argument is an <u>in_addr</u> structure.

       <b>IP_MULTICAST_LOOP</b> (since Linux 1.2)
              Set or read a boolean integer argument that determines whether sent multicast  packets  should  be
              looped back to the local sockets.

       <b>IP_MULTICAST_TTL</b> (since Linux 1.2)
              Set  or  read  the  time-to-live  value of outgoing multicast packets for this socket.  It is very
              important for multicast packets to set the smallest TTL possible.  The default is  1  which  means
              that  multicast  packets don't leave the local network unless the user program explicitly requests
              it.  Argument is an integer.

       <b>IP_NODEFRAG</b> (since Linux 2.6.36)
              If enabled (argument is nonzero), the reassembly of outgoing packets is disabled in the  netfilter
              layer.  The argument is an integer.

              This option is valid only for <b>SOCK_RAW</b> sockets.

       <b>IP_OPTIONS</b> (since Linux 2.0)
              Set  or  get  the  IP  options to be sent with every packet from this socket.  The arguments are a
              pointer to a memory buffer containing the options and the option length.  The  <b><a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt</a></b>(2)  call
              sets  the IP options associated with a socket.  The maximum option size for IPv4 is 40 bytes.  See
              RFC 791 for the allowed options.  When the initial connection request  packet  for  a  <b>SOCK_STREAM</b>
              socket  contains  IP  options,  the  IP  options will be set automatically to the options from the
              initial packet with routing headers reversed.  Incoming packets are not allowed to change  options
              after  the  connection  is  established.  The processing of all incoming source routing options is
              disabled by default and can be enabled by using the <u>accept_source_route</u>  <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u>  interface.   Other
              options  like  timestamps  are still handled.  For datagram sockets, IP options can be set only by
              the local user.  Calling <b><a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</a></b>(2) with <b>IP_OPTIONS</b>  puts  the  current  IP  options  used  for
              sending into the supplied buffer.

       <b>IP_PASSSEC</b> (since Linux 2.6.17)
              If labeled IPSEC or NetLabel is configured on the sending and receiving hosts, this option enables
              receiving  of the security context of the peer socket in an ancillary message of type <b>SCM_SECURITY</b>
              retrieved using <b><a href="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg</a></b>(2).  This option is supported only  for  UDP  sockets;  for  TCP  or  SCTP
              sockets, see the description of the <b>SO_PEERSEC</b> option below.

              The  value given as an argument to <b><a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt</a></b>(2) and returned as the result of <b><a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</a></b>(2) is an
              integer boolean flag.

              The security context returned in the <b>SCM_SECURITY</b> ancillary message is of the same format  as  the
              one described under the <b>SO_PEERSEC</b> option below.

              Note:  the  reuse  of  the <b>SCM_SECURITY</b> message type for the <b>IP_PASSSEC</b> socket option was likely a
              mistake, since other IP control messages use their own numbering scheme in the  IP  namespace  and
              often  use  the socket option value as the message type.  There is no conflict currently since the
              IP option with the same value as <b>SCM_SECURITY</b> is <b>IP_HDRINCL</b> and this is never used for  a  control
              message type.

       <b>IP_PKTINFO</b> (since Linux 2.2)
              Pass  an  <b>IP_PKTINFO</b>  ancillary  message  that  contains  a  <u>pktinfo</u>  structure that supplies some
              information about the incoming packet.  This  works  only  for  datagram  oriented  sockets.   The
              argument  is  a flag that tells the socket whether the <b>IP_PKTINFO</b> message should be passed or not.
              The message itself can be sent/retrieved only as a control message with a packet using  <b><a href="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg</a></b>(2)
              or <b><a href="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg</a></b>(2).

                  struct in_pktinfo {
                      unsigned int   ipi_ifindex;  /* Interface index */
                      struct in_addr ipi_spec_dst; /* Local address */
                      struct in_addr ipi_addr;     /* Header Destination
                                                      address */
                  };

              <u>ipi_ifindex</u>  is the unique index of the interface the packet was received on.  <u>ipi_spec_dst</u> is the
              local address of the packet and <u>ipi_addr</u> is the destination address  in  the  packet  header.   If
              <b>IP_PKTINFO</b>  is  passed  to  <b><a href="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg</a></b>(2)  and <u>ipi_spec_dst</u> is not zero, then it is used as the local
              source address for the routing table lookup and for setting up  IP  source  route  options.   When
              <u>ipi_ifindex</u>  is  not  zero,  the  primary  local  address  of the interface specified by the index
              overwrites <u>ipi_spec_dst</u> for the routing table lookup.

              Not supported for <b>SOCK_STREAM</b> sockets.

       <b>IP_RECVERR</b> (since Linux 2.2)
              Enable extended reliable error message passing.  When enabled on a datagram socket, all  generated
              errors  will be queued in a per-socket error queue.  When the user receives an error from a socket
              operation, the errors can be received by calling <b><a href="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg</a></b>(2) with the <b>MSG_ERRQUEUE</b> flag  set.   The
              <u>sock_extended_err</u>  structure  describing the error will be passed in an ancillary message with the
              type <b>IP_RECVERR</b> and the  level  <b>IPPROTO_IP</b>.   This  is  useful  for  reliable  error  handling  on
              unconnected sockets.  The received data portion of the error queue contains the error packet.

              The <b>IP_RECVERR</b> control message contains a <u>sock_extended_err</u> structure:

                  #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_NONE    0
                  #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_LOCAL   1
                  #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP    2
                  #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP6   3

                  struct sock_extended_err {
                      uint32_t ee_errno;   /* error number */
                      uint8_t  ee_origin;  /* where the error originated */
                      uint8_t  ee_type;    /* type */
                      uint8_t  ee_code;    /* code */
                      uint8_t  ee_pad;
                      uint32_t ee_info;    /* additional information */
                      uint32_t ee_data;    /* other data */
                      /* More data may follow */
                  };

                  struct sockaddr *SO_EE_OFFENDER(struct sock_extended_err *);

              <u>ee_errno</u> contains the <u>errno</u> number of the queued error.  <u>ee_origin</u> is the origin code of where the
              error  originated.   The  other  fields are protocol-specific.  The macro <b>SO_EE_OFFENDER</b> returns a
              pointer to the address of the network object where the error originated from given  a  pointer  to
              the  ancillary  message.   If  this  address  is  not  known, the <u>sa_family</u> member of the <u>sockaddr</u>
              contains <b>AF_UNSPEC</b> and the other fields of the <u>sockaddr</u> are undefined.

              IP uses the <u>sock_extended_err</u> structure as follows: <u>ee_origin</u>  is  set  to  <b>SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP</b>  for
              errors  received  as  an ICMP packet, or <b>SO_EE_ORIGIN_LOCAL</b> for locally generated errors.  Unknown
              values should be ignored.  <u>ee_type</u> and <u>ee_code</u> are set from the type and code fields of  the  ICMP
              header.   <u>ee_info</u>  contains the discovered MTU for <b>EMSGSIZE</b> errors.  The message also contains the
              <u>sockaddr_in</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>node</u> caused the error, which can be accessed  with  the  <b>SO_EE_OFFENDER</b>  macro.
              The <u>sin_family</u> field of the <b>SO_EE_OFFENDER</b> address is <b>AF_UNSPEC</b> when the source was unknown.  When
              the  error  originated  from the network, all IP options (<b>IP_OPTIONS</b>, <b>IP_TTL</b>, etc.) enabled on the
              socket and contained in the error packet are passed as  control  messages.   The  payload  of  the
              packet  causing  the  error  is  returned  as  normal  payload.  Note that TCP has no error queue;
              <b>MSG_ERRQUEUE</b> is not permitted on <b>SOCK_STREAM</b> sockets.  <b>IP_RECVERR</b> is valid for TCP, but all errors
              are returned by socket function return or <b>SO_ERROR</b> only.

              For raw sockets, <b>IP_RECVERR</b> enables passing of  all  received  ICMP  errors  to  the  application,
              otherwise errors are reported only on connected sockets

              It sets or retrieves an integer boolean flag.  <b>IP_RECVERR</b> defaults to off.

       <b>IP_RECVOPTS</b> (since Linux 2.2)
              Pass  all incoming IP options to the user in a <b>IP_OPTIONS</b> control message.  The routing header and
              other options are already filled in for the local host.  Not supported for <b>SOCK_STREAM</b> sockets.

       <b>IP_RECVORIGDSTADDR</b> (since Linux 2.6.29)
              This boolean option enables the <b>IP_ORIGDSTADDR</b> ancillary  message  in  <b><a href="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg</a></b>(2),  in  which  the
              kernel  returns  the  original  destination address of the datagram being received.  The ancillary
              message contains a <u>struct</u> <u>sockaddr_in</u>.  Not supported for <b>SOCK_STREAM</b> sockets.

       <b>IP_RECVTOS</b> (since Linux 2.2)
              If enabled, the <b>IP_TOS</b> ancillary message is passed with incoming  packets.   It  contains  a  byte
              which  specifies  the  Type  of  Service/Precedence field of the packet header.  Expects a boolean
              integer flag.  Not supported for <b>SOCK_STREAM</b> sockets.

       <b>IP_RECVTTL</b> (since Linux 2.2)
              When this flag is set, pass a <b>IP_TTL</b> control message with the time-to-live field of  the  received
              packet as a 32 bit integer.  Not supported for <b>SOCK_STREAM</b> sockets.

       <b>IP_RETOPTS</b> (since Linux 2.2)
              Identical  to  <b>IP_RECVOPTS</b>,  but  returns  raw unprocessed options with timestamp and route record
              options not filled in for this hop.  Not supported for <b>SOCK_STREAM</b> sockets.

       <b>IP_ROUTER_ALERT</b> (since Linux 2.2)
              Pass all to-be forwarded packets with the IP Router Alert option set to this socket.   Valid  only
              for  raw  sockets.  This is useful, for instance, for user-space RSVP daemons.  The tapped packets
              are not forwarded by the kernel; it is the user's responsibility to send them out  again.   Socket
              binding is ignored, such packets are filtered only by protocol.  Expects an integer flag.

       <b>IP_TOS</b> (since Linux 1.0)
              Set  or receive the Type-Of-Service (TOS) field that is sent with every IP packet originating from
              this socket.  It is used to prioritize packets on the network.  TOS is a  byte.   There  are  some
              standard   TOS   flags  defined:  <b>IPTOS_LOWDELAY</b>  to  minimize  delays  for  interactive  traffic,
              <b>IPTOS_THROUGHPUT</b>  to  optimize  throughput,  <b>IPTOS_RELIABILITY</b>  to   optimize   for   reliability,
              <b>IPTOS_MINCOST</b>  should  be  used for "filler data" where slow transmission doesn't matter.  At most
              one of these TOS values can be specified.  Other bits are invalid and  shall  be  cleared.   Linux
              sends  <b>IPTOS_LOWDELAY</b> datagrams first by default, but the exact behavior depends on the configured
              queueing  discipline.   Some  high-priority  levels  may   require   superuser   privileges   (the
              <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b> capability).

       <b>IP_TRANSPARENT</b> (since Linux 2.6.24)
              Setting  this  boolean  option  enables  transparent  proxying on this socket.  This socket option
              allows the calling application to bind to a nonlocal IP address and operate both as a client and a
              server with the foreign address as the local endpoint.  NOTE: this requires that routing be set up
              in a way that packets going to the foreign address are routed through the TProxy  box  (i.e.,  the
              system  hosting  the  application  that  employs the <b>IP_TRANSPARENT</b> socket option).  Enabling this
              socket option requires superuser privileges (the <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b> capability).

              TProxy redirection with the iptables TPROXY target also requires that this option be  set  on  the
              redirected socket.

       <b>IP_TTL</b> (since Linux 1.0)
              Set or retrieve the current time-to-live field that is used in every packet sent from this socket.

       <b>IP_UNBLOCK_SOURCE</b> (since Linux 2.4.22 / 2.5.68)
              Unblock previously blocked multicast source.  Returns <b>EADDRNOTAVAIL</b> when given source is not being
              blocked.

              Argument is an <u>ip_mreq_source</u> structure as described under <b>IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP</b>.

       <b>SO_PEERSEC</b> (since Linux 2.6.17)
              If labeled IPSEC or NetLabel is configured on both the sending and receiving hosts, this read-only
              socket  option  returns  the  security  context  of  the peer socket connected to this socket.  By
              default, this will be the same as the security context of the process that created the peer socket
              unless overridden by the policy or by a process with the required permissions.

              The argument to <b><a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</a></b>(2) is a pointer to a buffer of the specified length in bytes into which
              the security context string will be copied.  If the buffer length is less than the length  of  the
              security  context  string,  then  <b><a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</a></b>(2)  returns -1, sets <u>errno</u> to <b>ERANGE</b>, and returns the
              required length via <u>optlen</u>.  The caller should allocate at least <b>NAME_MAX</b>  bytes  for  the  buffer
              initially,  although this is not guaranteed to be sufficient.  Resizing the buffer to the returned
              length and retrying may be necessary.

              The security context string may include a terminating null character in the returned  length,  but
              is  not guaranteed to do so: a security context "foo" might be represented as either {'f','o','o'}
              of length 3 or {'f','o','o','\0'} of length 4, which are considered to  be  interchangeable.   The
              string  is  printable,  does not contain non-terminating null characters, and is in an unspecified
              encoding (in particular, it is not guaranteed to be ASCII or UTF-8).

              The use of this option for sockets in the <b>AF_INET</b> address family is supported since  Linux  2.6.17
              for TCP sockets, and since Linux 4.17 for SCTP sockets.

              For  SELinux, NetLabel conveys only the MLS portion of the security context of the peer across the
              wire, defaulting the rest of the security context to the values defined  in  the  policy  for  the
              netmsg  initial  security  identifier  (SID).   However,  NetLabel  can be configured to pass full
              security contexts over loopback.  Labeled IPSEC always passes full security contexts  as  part  of
              establishing  the  security  association  (SA) and looks them up based on the association for each
              packet.

   <b><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></b> <b>interfaces</b>
       The IP protocol supports a set of <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u> interfaces to configure some global parameters.   The  parameters
       can  be  accessed by reading or writing files in the directory <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/net/ipv4/">/proc/sys/net/ipv4/</a></u>.  Interfaces described
       as <u>Boolean</u> take an integer value, with a nonzero value ("true") meaning that the corresponding option  is
       enabled, and a zero value ("false") meaning that the option is disabled.

       <u>ip_always_defrag</u> (Boolean; since Linux 2.2.13)
              [New  with Linux 2.2.13; in earlier kernel versions this feature was controlled at compile time by
              the <b>CONFIG_IP_ALWAYS_DEFRAG</b> option; this option is not present in Linux 2.4.x and later]

              When this boolean flag is enabled (not equal 0), incoming fragments  (parts  of  IP  packets  that
              arose  when  some  host between origin and destination decided that the packets were too large and
              cut them into pieces) will be reassembled (defragmented) before being processed, even if they  are
              about to be forwarded.

              Enable  only  if  running either a firewall that is the sole link to your network or a transparent
              proxy; never ever use it for a normal router or host.  Otherwise, fragmented communication can  be
              disturbed  if  the fragments travel over different links.  Defragmentation also has a large memory
              and CPU time cost.

              This is automagically turned on when masquerading or transparent proxying are configured.

       <u>ip_autoconfig</u> (since Linux 2.2 to Linux 2.6.17)
              Not documented.

       <u>ip_default_ttl</u> (integer; default: 64; since Linux 2.2)
              Set the default time-to-live value of outgoing packets.  This can be changed per socket  with  the
              <b>IP_TTL</b> option.

       <u>ip_dynaddr</u> (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.0.31)
              Enable  dynamic socket address and masquerading entry rewriting on interface address change.  This
              is useful for dialup interface with changing IP addresses.  0 means no rewriting, 1  turns  it  on
              and 2 enables verbose mode.

       <u>ip_forward</u> (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 1.2)
              Enable IP forwarding with a boolean flag.  IP forwarding can be also set on a per-interface basis.

       <u>ip_local_port_range</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              This file contains two integers that define the default local port range allocated to sockets that
              are  not  explicitly  bound  to  a  port  number—that  is, the range used for <u>ephemeral</u> <u>ports</u>.  An
              ephemeral port is allocated to a socket in the following circumstances:

              •  the port number in a socket address is specified as 0 when calling <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2);

              •  <b><a href="../man2/listen.2.html">listen</a></b>(2) is called on a stream socket that was not previously bound;

              •  <b><a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</a></b>(2) was called on a socket that was not previously bound;

              •  <b><a href="../man2/sendto.2.html">sendto</a></b>(2) is called on a datagram socket that was not previously bound.

              Allocation of ephemeral ports starts with the first number in <u>ip_local_port_range</u>  and  ends  with
              the  second  number.   If the range of ephemeral ports is exhausted, then the relevant system call
              returns an error (but see BUGS).

              Note that the port range in <u>ip_local_port_range</u>  should  not  conflict  with  the  ports  used  by
              masquerading (although the case is handled).  Also, arbitrary choices may cause problems with some
              firewall  packet  filters  that  make  assumptions about the local ports in use.  The first number
              should be at least greater than 1024, or better, greater than 4096, to  avoid  clashes  with  well
              known ports and to minimize firewall problems.

       <u>ip_no_pmtu_disc</u> (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.2)
              If  enabled,  don't do Path MTU Discovery for TCP sockets by default.  Path MTU discovery may fail
              if misconfigured firewalls (that drop all ICMP  packets)  or  misconfigured  interfaces  (e.g.,  a
              point-to-point  link where the both ends don't agree on the MTU) are on the path.  It is better to
              fix the broken routers on the path than to turn off Path MTU Discovery globally, because not doing
              it incurs a high cost to the network.

       <u>ip_nonlocal_bind</u> (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.4)
              If set, allows processes to <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2) to nonlocal IP addresses, which can be quite useful,  but  may
              break some applications.

       <u>ip6frag_time</u> (integer; default: 30)
              Time in seconds to keep an IPv6 fragment in memory.

       <u>ip6frag_secret_interval</u> (integer; default: 600)
              Regeneration  interval  (in seconds) of the hash secret (or lifetime for the hash secret) for IPv6
              fragments.

       <u>ipfrag_high_thresh</u> (integer)
       <u>ipfrag_low_thresh</u> (integer)
              If the amount of queued IP fragments reaches <u>ipfrag_high_thresh</u>,  the  queue  is  pruned  down  to
              <u>ipfrag_low_thresh</u>.  Contains an integer with the number of bytes.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>EACCES</b> The  user tried to execute an operation without the necessary permissions.  These include: sending
              a packet to a broadcast address without having the <b>SO_BROADCAST</b> flag set; sending a packet  via  a
              <u>prohibit</u>  route;  modifying  firewall  settings  without  superuser  privileges (the <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>
              capability); binding to a privileged port without superuser privileges  (the  <b>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</b>
              capability).

       <b>EADDRINUSE</b>
              Tried to bind to an address already in use.

       <b>EADDRNOTAVAIL</b>
              A nonexistent interface was requested or the requested source address was not local.

       <b>EAGAIN</b> Operation on a nonblocking socket would block.

       <b>EALREADY</b>
              A connection operation on a nonblocking socket is already in progress.

       <b>ECONNABORTED</b>
              A connection was closed during an <b><a href="../man2/accept.2.html">accept</a></b>(2).

       <b>EHOSTUNREACH</b>
              No valid routing table entry matches the destination address.  This error can be caused by an ICMP
              message from a remote router or for the local routing table.

       <b>EINVAL</b> Invalid argument passed.  For send operations this can be caused by sending to a <u>blackhole</u> route.

       <b>EISCONN</b>
              <b><a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</a></b>(2) was called on an already connected socket.

       <b>EMSGSIZE</b>
              Datagram is bigger than an MTU on the path and it cannot be fragmented.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
       <b>ENOMEM</b> Not  enough  free  memory.   This  often means that the memory allocation is limited by the socket
              buffer limits, not by the system memory, but this is not 100% consistent.

       <b>ENOENT</b> <b>SIOCGSTAMP</b> was called on a socket where no packet arrived.

       <b>ENOPKG</b> A kernel subsystem was not configured.

       <b>ENOPROTOOPT</b> and <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              Invalid socket option passed.

       <b>ENOTCONN</b>
              The operation is defined only on a connected socket, but the socket wasn't connected.

       <b>EPERM</b>  User doesn't have permission to set high priority, change configuration, or send  signals  to  the
              requested process or group.

       <b>EPIPE</b>  The connection was unexpectedly closed or shut down by the other end.

       <b>ESOCKTNOSUPPORT</b>
              The socket is not configured or an unknown socket type was requested.

       Other errors may be generated by the overlaying protocols; see <b><a href="../man7/tcp.7.html">tcp</a></b>(7), <b><a href="../man7/raw.7.html">raw</a></b>(7), <b><a href="../man7/udp.7.html">udp</a></b>(7), and <b><a href="../man7/socket.7.html">socket</a></b>(7).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>IP_FREEBIND</b>,   <b>IP_MSFILTER</b>,   <b>IP_MTU</b>,   <b>IP_MTU_DISCOVER</b>,   <b>IP_RECVORIGDSTADDR</b>,   <b>IP_PASSSEC</b>,  <b>IP_PKTINFO</b>,
       <b>IP_RECVERR</b>, <b>IP_ROUTER_ALERT</b>, and <b>IP_TRANSPARENT</b> are Linux-specific.

       Be very careful with the <b>SO_BROADCAST</b> option - it is not privileged in Linux.  It is easy to overload the
       network with careless broadcasts.  For new application protocols it is better to use  a  multicast  group
       instead  of broadcasting.  Broadcasting is discouraged.  See RFC 6762 for an example of a protocol (mDNS)
       using the more modern multicast approach to communicating with an open-ended group of hosts on the  local
       network.

       Some  other  BSD  sockets  implementations  provide <b>IP_RCVDSTADDR</b> and <b>IP_RECVIF</b> socket options to get the
       destination address and the interface of received datagrams.  Linux has the more general  <b>IP_PKTINFO</b>  for
       the same task.

       Some  BSD  sockets  implementations also provide an <b>IP_RECVTTL</b> option, but an ancillary message with type
       <b>IP_RECVTTL</b> is passed with the incoming packet.  This is different from the <b>IP_TTL</b> option used in Linux.

       Using the <b>SOL_IP</b> socket options level isn't portable; BSD-based stacks use the <b>IPPROTO_IP</b> level.

       <b>INADDR_ANY</b> (0.0.0.0) and <b>INADDR_BROADCAST</b> (255.255.255.255) are byte-order-neutral.  This means  <b><a href="../man3/htonl.3.html">htonl</a></b>(3)
       has no effect on them.

   <b>Compatibility</b>
       For  compatibility  with  Linux  2.0, the obsolete <b>socket(AF_INET,</b> <b>SOCK_PACKET,</b> <u>protocol</u><b>)</b> syntax is still
       supported to open a <b><a href="../man7/packet.7.html">packet</a></b>(7) socket.  This is deprecated and should  be  replaced  by  <b>socket(AF_PACKET,</b>
       <b>SOCK_RAW,</b>  <u>protocol</u><b>)</b>  instead.   The main difference is the new <u>sockaddr_ll</u> address structure for generic
       link layer information instead of the old <b>sockaddr_pkt</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There are too many inconsistent error values.

       The error used to diagnose exhaustion of the ephemeral port range differs across the various system calls
       (<b><a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/listen.2.html">listen</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/sendto.2.html">sendto</a></b>(2)) that can assign ephemeral ports.

       The ioctls to configure IP-specific interface options and ARP tables are not described.

       Receiving the original destination address with <b>MSG_ERRQUEUE</b> in <u>msg_name</u> by <b><a href="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg</a></b>(2) does not  work  in
       some Linux 2.2 kernels.
