</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mu-easy - a quick introduction to <b>mu</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mu</b>  is a set of tools for dealing with e-mail messages in Maildirs. There are many options, which are all
       described in the man pages for the various sub-commands. This man pages jumps over all of the details and
       gives examples of some common use cases. If the use cases described here do not  precisely  do  what  you
       want,  please check the more extensive information in the man page about the sub-command you are using --
       for example, the <b><a href="../man1/mu-index.1.html">mu-index</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/mu-find.1.html">mu-find</a></b>(1) man pages.

       <b>NOTE</b>: the <b>index</b> command (and therefore, the ones that depend on that, such as  <b>find</b>),  require  that  you
       store  your mail in the Maildir-format. If you don't do so, you can still use the other commands, but you
       won't be able to index/search your mail.

       By default, <b>mu</b> uses colorized output when it thinks your terminal is capable of doing so.  If  you  don't
       like  color,  you can use the <b>--nocolor</b> command-line option, or set either the <b>MU_NOCOLOR</b> or the <b>NO_COLOR</b>
       environment variable to non-empty.

</pre><h4><b>SETTING</b> <b>THINGS</b> <b>UP</b></h4><pre>
       The first time you run the <b>mu</b> commands, you need to initialize it. This is done with the <b>init</b> command.

              $ mu init

       This uses the defaults (see <b><a href="../man1/mu-init.1.html">mu-init</a></b>(1) for details on how to change that).

</pre><h4><b>INDEXING</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>E-MAIL</b></h4><pre>
       Before you can search e-mails, you'll first need to index them:

              $ mu index

       The process can take a few minutes, depending on the amount of mail you have, the speed of your computer,
       hard drive etc. Usually, indexing should be able to reach a speed of a few hundred messages per second.

       <b>mu</b> <b>index</b> guesses the top-level Maildir to do its job; if it guesses wrong,  you  can  use  the  <b>--maildir</b>
       option to specify the top-level directory that should be processed. See the <b><a href="../man1/mu-index.1.html">mu-index</a></b>(1) man page for more
       details.

       Normally,  <b>mu</b>  <b>index</b>  visits  all  the  directories under the top-level Maildir; however, you can exclude
       certain directories (say, the `trash' or `spam' folders) by  creating  a  file  called  <u>.noindex</u>  in  the
       directory.  When  <b>mu</b>  sees  such  a  file,  it  will  exclude this directory and its sub-directories from
       indexing.  Also see <b>.noupdate</b> in the <b><a href="../man1/mu-index.1.html">mu-index</a></b>(1) manpage.

</pre><h4><b>SEARCHING</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>E-MAIL</b></h4><pre>
       After you have indexed your mail, you can start searching it. By default, the search results are  printed
       on  standard  output.  Alternatively,  the output can take the form of Maildir with symbolic links to the
       found messages. This enables integration with e-mail clients; see the <b><a href="../man1/mu-find.1.html">mu-find</a></b>(1) man  page  for  details,
       the syntax of the search parameters and so on. Here, we just give some examples for common cases.

       You can use the <b>mu</b> <b>fields</b> command to get information about all possible fields and flags.

       First, let's search for all messages sent to Julius (Caesar) regarding fruit:

              $ mu find t:julius fruit

       This should return something like:

              2008-07-31T21:57:25 EEST John Milton &lt;<a href="mailto:jm@example.com">jm@example.com</a>&gt; Fere libenter homines id quod volunt credunt

       This  means  there  is a message to `julius' with `fruit' somewhere in the message.  In this case, it's a
       message from John Milton. Note that the date format depends on your the language/locale you are using.

       How do we know that the message was sent to Julius Caesar? Well, it's not visible from the results above,
       because the default fields that are shown are date/sender/subject. However, we can change this using  the
       <b>--fields</b> parameter (try <b>mu</b> <b>fields</b> to see all the details):

              $ mu find --fields="t s" t:julius fruit

       In other words, display the `To:'-field (t) and the subject (s). This should return something like:
              Julius Caesar &lt;<a href="mailto:jc@example.com">jc@example.com</a>&gt; Fere libenter homines id quod volunt credunt

       This is the same message found before, only with some different fields displayed.

       By default, <b>mu</b> uses the logical <u>AND</u> for the search parameters -- that is, it displays messages that match
       all the parameters. However, we can use logical <u>OR</u> as well:

              $ mu find t:julius OR f:socrates

       In  other  words, display messages that are either sent to Julius Caesar <b>or</b> are from Socrates. This could
       return something like:

              2008-07-31T21:57:25 EEST Socrates &lt;<a href="mailto:soc@example.com">soc@example.com</a>&gt; cool stuff
              2008-07-31T21:57:25 EEST John Milton &lt;<a href="mailto:jm@example.com">jm@example.com</a>&gt; Fere libenter homines id quod volunt credunt

       What if we want to see some of the body of the message? You can get a `summary' of the first lines of the
       message using the <b>--summary-len</b> option, which will `summarize' the first <u>n</u> lines of the message:

              $ mu find --summary-len=3 napoleon m:/archive

              1970-01-01T02:00:00 EET Napoleon Bonaparte &lt;<a href="mailto:nb@example.com">nb@example.com</a>&gt; rock on dude
              Summary: Le 24 février 1815, la vigie de Notre-Dame de la Garde signala le
              trois-mâts le Pharaon, venant de Smyrne, Trieste et Naples. Comme
              d'habitude, un pilote côtier partit aussitôt du port, rasa le château

       The summary consists of the first <u>n</u> lines of the message with all superfluous whitespace removed.

       Also note the <b>m:/archive</b> parameter in the query. This means that we only  match  messages  in  a  maildir
       called <u>'/archive'</u>.

</pre><h4><b>MORE</b> <b>QUERIES</b></h4><pre>
       Let's  list  a  few  more  queries  that may be interesting; please note that searches for message flags,
       priority and date ranges are only available in <b>mu</b> version 0.9 or later.

       Get all important messages which are signed:
              *$ mu find flag:signed prio:high *

       Get all messages from Jim without an attachment:
              *$ mu find from:jim AND NOT flag:attach*

       Get all messages where Jack is in one of the contact fields:
              *$ mu find contact:jack*

       This uses the special contact: pseudo-field which matches (<b>from</b>, <b>to</b>, <b>cc</b> and <b>bcc</b>).

       Get all messages in the Sent Items folder about yoghurt:
              *$mu find maildir:'/Sent Items' yoghurt*

       Note how we need to quote search terms that include spaces.

       Get all unread messages where the subject mentions Ångström:
              *$ mu find subject:Ångström flag:unread*

       which is equivalent to:
              *$ mu find subject:angstrom flag:unread*

       because does <b>mu</b> is case-insensitive and accent-insensitive.

       Get all unread messages between March 2002 and August 2003 about some bird (or a Swedish rock band):
              *$ mu find date:20020301..20030831 nightingale flag:unread*

       Get all messages received today:
              *$ mu find date:today..now*

       Get all messages we got in the last two weeks about emacs:
              *$ mu find date:2w..now emacs*

       Another powerful feature (since 0.9.6) are wildcard searches,  where  you  can  search  for  the  last  <u>n</u>
       characters in a word. For example, you can search for:
              *$ mu find 'subject:soc*'*

       and get mails about soccer, Socrates, society, and so on. Note, it's important to quote the search query,
       otherwise the shell will interpret the `*'.

       You can also search for messages with a certain attachment using their filename, for example:

              *$ mu find 'file:pic*'*

       will get you all messages with an attachment starting with `pic'.

       If you want to find attachments with a certain MIME-type, you can use the following:

       Get all messages with PDF attachments:
              *$ mu find mime:application/pdf*

       or even:

       Get all messages with image attachments:
              *$ mu find 'mime:image/*'*

       Note  that  (1)  the `*' wildcard can only be used as the rightmost thing in a search query, and (2) that
       you need to quote the search term, because otherwise your shell will interpret the `*' (expanding  it  to
       all files in the current directory -- probably not what you want).

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAYING</b> <b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       We  might  also want to display the complete messages instead of the header information. This can be done
       using <b>mu</b> <b>view</b> command. Note that this command does not use the database; you simply provide it  the  path
       to a message.

       Therefore, if you want to display some message from a search query, you'll need its path. To get the path
       (think *l*ocation) for our first example we can use:

              $ mu find --fields="l" t:julius fruit

       And we'll get something like:
              /home/someuser/Maildir/archive/cur/1266188485_0.6850.cthulhu:2,

       We can now display this message:

              $ mu view /home/someuser/Maildir/archive/cur/1266188485_0.6850.cthulhu:2,
              From: John Milton &lt;<a href="mailto:jm@example.com">jm@example.com</a>&gt;
              To: Julius Caesar &lt;<a href="mailto:jc@example.com">jc@example.com</a>&gt;
              Subject: Fere libenter homines id quod volunt credunt
              Date: 2008-07-31T21:57:25 EEST

              OF Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
              Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal taste
              Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
              [...]

</pre><h4><b>FINDING</b> <b>CONTACTS</b></h4><pre>
       While <b>mu</b> <b>find</b> searches for messages, there is also <b>mu</b> <b>cfind</b> to find <u>contacts</u>, that is, names + addresses.
       Without any search expression, <b>mu</b> <b>cfind</b> lists all of your contacts.

              $ mu cfind julius

       will  find  all  contacts  with  `julius'  in either name or e-mail address. Note that <b>mu</b> <b>cfind</b> accepts a
       <u>regular</u> <u>expression</u> (as per <b><a href="../man3/pcre.3.html">pcre</a></b>(3)

       <b>mu</b> <b>cfind</b> also supports a <b>--format=</b>-parameter, which sets the output  to  some  specific  format,  so  the
       results  can  be imported into another program. For example, to export your contact information to a <b>mutt</b>
       address book file, you can use something like:

              $ mu cfind --format=mutt-alias &gt; <a href="file:~/mutt-aliases">~/mutt-aliases</a>

       Then, you can use them in <b>mutt</b> if you add something like <b>source</b> <b><a href="file:~/mutt-aliases">~/mutt-aliases</a></b> to your <u>muttrc</u>.
