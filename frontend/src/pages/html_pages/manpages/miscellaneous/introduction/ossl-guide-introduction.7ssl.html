       ossl-guide-introduction - OpenSSL Guide: An introduction to OpenSSL

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>IS</b> <b>OPENSSL?</b></h4><pre>
       OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured toolkit for general-purpose cryptography and secure
       communication. Its features are made available via a command line application that enables users to
       perform various cryptography related functions such as generating keys and certificates. Additionally it
       supplies two libraries that application developers can use to implement cryptography based capabilities
       and to securely communicate across a network.  Finally, it also has a set of providers that supply
       implementations of a broad set of cryptographic algorithms.

       OpenSSL is fully open source. Version 3.0 and above are distributed under the Apache v2 license.

</pre><h4><b>GETTING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>INSTALLING</b> <b>OPENSSL</b></h4><pre>
       The OpenSSL Project develops and distributes the source code for OpenSSL. You can obtain that source code
       via the OpenSSL website (&lt;https://www.openssl.org/source&gt;).

       Many Operating Systems (notably Linux distributions) supply pre-built OpenSSL binaries either pre-
       installed or available via the package management system in use for that OS. It is worth checking whether
       this applies to you before attempting to build OpenSSL from the source code.

       Some third parties also supply OpenSSL binaries (e.g. for Windows and some other platforms). The OpenSSL
       project maintains a list of these third parties at &lt;https://github.com/openssl/openssl/wiki/Binaries&gt;.

       If you build and install OpenSSL from the source code then you should download the appropriate files for
       the version that you want to use from the link given above. Extract the contents of the <b>tar.gz</b> archive
       file that you downloaded into an appropriate directory. Inside that archive you will find a file named
       <b>INSTALL.md</b> which will supply detailed instructions on how to build and install OpenSSL from source. Make
       sure you read the contents of that file carefully in order to achieve a successful build. In the
       directory you will also find a set of <b>NOTES</b> files that provide further platform specific information.
       Make sure you carefully read the file appropriate to your platform. As well as the platform specific
       <b>NOTES</b> files there is also a <b>NOTES-PERL.md</b> file that provides information about setting up Perl for use by
       the OpenSSL build system across multiple platforms.

       Sometimes you may want to build and install OpenSSL from source on a system which already has a pre-built
       version of OpenSSL installed on it via the Operating System package management system (for example if you
       want to use a newer version of OpenSSL than the one supplied by your Operating System). In this case it
       is strongly recommended to install OpenSSL to a different location than where the pre-built version is
       installed. You should <b>never</b> replace the pre-built version with a different version as this may break your
       system.

</pre><h4><b>CONTENTS</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>OPENSSL</b> <b>GUIDE</b></h4><pre>
       The OpenSSL Guide is a series of documentation pages (starting with this one) that introduce some of the
       main concepts in OpenSSL. The guide can either be read end-to-end in order, or alternatively you can
       simply skip to the parts most applicable to your use case. Note however that later pages may depend on
       and assume knowledge from earlier pages.

       The pages in the guide are as follows:
