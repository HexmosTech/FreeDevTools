       rancid_intro - introduction to the Really Awesome New Cisco confIg Differ

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rancid</b>  is  really  more  than  just a Cisco configuration differ.  It handles several different device's
       configurations; currently including Alteon, Arista, Bay Networks  (Nortel),  Cisco,  Extreme,  F5  BigIP,
       Force10,  Fortinet,  Foundry,  HP  Procurve switches, Hauwei VRP, Hitachi, Juniper Routers and edge (ERX)
       routers, MRTd daemon, Microtik routers, Netscaler  load  balancers,  Netscreen  firewalls,  Redback,  SMC
       switches, Xirrus arrays, Zebra routing software, and the ADC-Kentrox EZ-T3 mux.

       <b>rancid</b>  uses  an  expect script to login using ssh, telnet, or rsh to each of a list of devices and run a
       set of commands for that device-type and collects the output.  The output is run through  some  filtering
       to  summarize,  reformat,  and/or  snip unwanted or security related data such as chassis temperature and
       easily reverse-able passwords.

       Named after the device's name in the group's configuration file  (<u>router.db</u>),  the  resulting  files  are
       saved  in  the  directory  &lt;group&gt;/configs.  Except for the data filtered from the configuration file for
       security reasons, such as reversable passwords, these files are suitable for loading directly to  restore
       a lost configuration.  See <b><a href="../man5/rancid.conf.5.html">rancid.conf</a></b>(5) for more information on &lt;group&gt;s.

       After  filtering,  a  uni-diff (see <b><a href="../man1/diff.1.html">diff</a></b>(1)) of the result is produced for each of the devices in a group
       against that of the previous run of <b>rancid</b> and is e-mailed to that group's mail  list,  "rancid-&lt;group&gt;".
       This  e-mail  will  also  include  any  differences of the device list in the group's configuration file,
       <u>router.db</u>.

       Lastly, all the updated files are checked into the revision control system  (CVS,  Subversion,  or  git).
       And, administrative messages, such as collections that are failing for longer than <b>OLDTIME,</b> are mailed to
       "rancid-admin-&lt;group&gt;".

       Additional  utilities,  including  a  looking  glass,  come  with rancid.  See rancid's share directory (
       <u>share/rancid</u>).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>E-MAIL</b></h4><pre>
       Below  is  a  sample  of  a  uni-diff  produced  from  the  group  "shrubbery"  for  the   device   named
       dfw.shrubbery.net, which happens to be a Cisco GSR.

       From: rancid
       To: <a href="mailto:rancid-shrubbery@shrubbery.net">rancid-shrubbery@shrubbery.net</a>

       In  this  example,  we see that a Gigabit Ethernet linecard was removed from slot 6.  However, since this
       data is collected from "show" commands on the router, it could just as easily be that the card crashed so
       the RP can not communicate with it to collect information.

</pre><h4><b>GETTING</b> <b>STARTED</b></h4><pre>
       Installation instructions are included in the distribution's  top-level  directory  in  the  README  file
       (which  will  be installed in share/rancid).  Once the installation is complete, start by reading the man
       pages listed below or follow the basic instructions included in the README file.
