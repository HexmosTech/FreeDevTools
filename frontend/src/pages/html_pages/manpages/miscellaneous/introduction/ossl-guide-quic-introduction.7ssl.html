       ossl-guide-quic-introduction - OpenSSL Guide: An introduction to QUIC in OpenSSL

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       This page will provide an introduction to some basic QUIC concepts and background and how it is used
       within OpenSSL. It assumes that you have a basic understanding of UDP/IP and sockets. It also assumes
       that you are familiar with some OpenSSL and TLS fundamentals (see <b><a href="../man7/ossl-guide-libraries-introduction.7.html">ossl-guide-libraries-introduction</a></b>(7)
       and <b><a href="../man7/ossl-guide-tls-introduction.7.html">ossl-guide-tls-introduction</a></b>(7)).

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>IS</b> <b>QUIC?</b></h4><pre>
       QUIC is a general purpose protocol for enabling applications to securely communicate over a network. It
       is defined in RFC9000 (see &lt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9000/&gt;). QUIC integrates parts of the TLS
       protocol for connection establishment but independently protects packets.  It provides similar security
       guarantees to TLS such as confidentiality, integrity and authentication (see
       <b><a href="../man7/ossl-guide-tls-introduction.7.html">ossl-guide-tls-introduction</a></b>(7)).

       QUIC delivers a number of advantages:

       Multiple streams
           It  supports  multiple  streams  of  communication  (see  "QUIC STREAMS" below), allowing application
           protocols built on QUIC to create arbitrarily many bytestreams for communication between a client and
           server. This allows an application protocol to avoid problems where one packet of  data  is  held  up
           waiting  on another packet being delivered (commonly referred to as "head-of-line blocking"). It also
           enables an application to open additional logical streams without requiring a round-trip exchange  of
           packets between the client and server as is required when opening an additional TLS/TCP connection.

       HTTP/3
           Since  QUIC  is the basis of HTTP/3, support for QUIC also enables applications to use HTTP/3 using a
           suitable third-party library.

       Fast connection initiation
           Future versions of OpenSSL will offer support for 0-RTT connection initiation, allowing a  connection
           to  be initiated to a server and application data to be transmitted without any waiting time. This is
           similar to TLS 1.3's 0-RTT functionality but also avoids the round trip needed to open a TCP  socket;
           thus, it is similar to a combination of TLS 1.3 0-RTT and TCP Fast Open.

       Connection migration
           Future  versions  of  OpenSSL  will  offer  support for connection migration, allowing connections to
           seamlessly survive IP address changes.

       Datagram based use cases
           Future versions of OpenSSL will offer support for the QUIC datagram extension, allowing  support  for
           both TLS and DTLS-style use cases on a single connection.

       Implemented as application library
           Because  most  QUIC  implementations,  including  OpenSSL's  implementation,  are  implemented  as an
           application library rather than by an operating system, an application can gain the benefit  of  QUIC
           without  needing  to  wait for an OS update to be deployed. Future evolutions and enhancements to the
           QUIC protocol can be delivered as quickly as an application can be updated without dependency  on  an
           OS update cadence.

       Multiplexing over a single UDP socket
           Because  QUIC  is  UDP-based, it is possible to multiplex a QUIC connection on the same UDP socket as
           some other UDP-based protocols, such as RTP.

</pre><h4><b>QUIC</b> <b>TIME</b> <b>BASED</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       A key difference between the TLS implementation and the QUIC implementation in OpenSSL  is  how  time  is
       handled.  The  QUIC  protocol  requires  various actions to be performed on a regular basis regardless of
       whether application data is being transmitted or received.

       OpenSSL introduces a new function <b><a href="../man3/SSL_handle_events.3.html">SSL_handle_events</a></b>(3) that will automatically  process  any  outstanding
       time based events that must be handled.  Alternatively calling any I/O function such as <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read_ex.3.html">SSL_read_ex</a></b>(3) or
       <b><a href="../man3/SSL_write_ex.3.html">SSL_write_ex</a></b>(3)  will  also  process  these events. There is also <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get_event_timeout.3.html">SSL_get_event_timeout</a></b>(3) which tells an
       application the amount of time that remains until <b><a href="../man3/SSL_handle_events.3.html">SSL_handle_events</a></b>(3) (or  any  I/O  function)  must  be
       called.

       Fortunately a blocking application that does not leave the QUIC connection idle, and is regularly calling
       I/O  functions  does  not typically need to worry about this. However if you are developing a nonblocking
       application or one that may leave the QUIC connection idle for a period of time then  you  will  need  to
       arrange to call these functions.

       OpenSSL  provides  an  optional "thread assisted mode" that will automatically create a background thread
       and will regularly call <b><a href="../man3/SSL_handle_events.3.html">SSL_handle_events</a></b>(3) in a thread safe manner. This provides a simple way  for  an
       application  to  satisfy  the QUIC requirements for time based events without having to implement special
       logic to accomplish it.

</pre><h4><b>QUIC</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TLS</b></h4><pre>
       QUIC reuses parts of the TLS protocol in its implementation. Specifically the TLS handshake  also  exists
       in QUIC. The TLS handshake messages are wrapped up in QUIC protocol messages in order to send them to the
       peer.  Once  the  TLS  handshake  is  complete  all application data is sent entirely using QUIC protocol
       messages without  using  TLS  -  although  some  TLS  handshake  messages  may  still  be  sent  in  some
       circumstances.

       This  relationship between QUIC and TLS means that many of the API functions in OpenSSL that apply to TLS
       connections also apply to QUIC connections and applications can use them in exactly the  same  way.  Some
       functions  do  not  apply  to  QUIC  at  all,  and others have altered semantics. You should refer to the
       documentation pages for each function for information on how it applies to QUIC.  Typically  if  QUIC  is
       not mentioned in the manual pages then the functions apply to both TLS and QUIC.

</pre><h4><b>QUIC</b> <b>STREAMS</b></h4><pre>
       QUIC  introduces  the  concept  of  "streams".  A  stream  provides  a reliable mechanism for sending and
       receiving application data between the endpoints. The bytes transmitted are guaranteed to be received  in
       the  same  order  they  were  sent without any loss of data or reordering of the bytes. A TLS application
       effectively has one bi-directional stream available to it per TLS connection. A QUIC application can have
       multiple uni-directional or bi-directional streams available to it for each connection.

       In OpenSSL an <b>SSL</b> object is used to represent both connections and streams.  A QUIC  application  creates
       an  initial  <b>SSL</b>  object  to  represent  the  connection  (known  as the connection <b>SSL</b> object). Once the
       connection is complete additional <b>SSL</b> objects can be created to represent streams (known  as  stream  <b>SSL</b>
       objects).  Unless  configured  otherwise,  a  "default" stream is also associated with the connection <b>SSL</b>
       object so you can still write data and read data to/from it. Some OpenSSL API functions can only be  used
       with  connection <b>SSL</b> objects, and some can only be used with stream <b>SSL</b> objects.  Check the documentation
       for each function to confirm what type of <b>SSL</b> object can be used in any particular context. A  connection
       <b>SSL</b> object that has a default stream attached to it can be used in contexts that require a connection <b>SSL</b>
       object or in contexts that require a stream <b>SSL</b> object.

</pre><h4><b>SOCKETS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>BLOCKING</b></h4><pre>
       TLS  assumes  "stream"  type  semantics  for its underlying transport layer protocol (usually achieved by
       using TCP). However QUIC assumes "datagram" type semantics by using UDP.  An  OpenSSL  application  using
       QUIC is responsible for creating a BIO to represent the underlying transport layer. This BIO must support
       datagrams  and  is  typically  <b><a href="../man3/BIO_s_datagram.3.html">BIO_s_datagram</a></b>(3), but other <b>BIO</b> choices are available.  See <b><a href="../man7/bio.7.html">bio</a></b>(7) for an
       introduction to OpenSSL's <b>BIO</b> concept.

       A significant difference between OpenSSL TLS applications and OpenSSL QUIC applications is the  way  that
       blocking  is  implemented.  In  TLS if your application expects blocking behaviour then you configure the
       underlying socket for blocking. Conversely if your  application  wants  nonblocking  behaviour  then  the
       underlying socket is configured to be nonblocking.

       With  an  OpenSSL  QUIC  application  the  underlying socket must always be configured to be nonblocking.
       Howevever the <b>SSL</b> object will, by default, still operate in blocking  mode.  So,  from  an  application's
       perspective,  calls  to  functions  such  as <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read_ex.3.html">SSL_read_ex</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/SSL_write_ex.3.html">SSL_write_ex</a></b>(3) and other I/O functions will
       still block. OpenSSL itself provides that  blocking  capability  for  QUIC  instead  of  the  socket.  If
       nonblocking behaviour is desired then the application must call <b><a href="../man3/SSL_set_blocking_mode.3.html">SSL_set_blocking_mode</a></b>(3).
