       ossl-guide-libssl-introduction, ssl - OpenSSL Guide: An introduction to libssl

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       The OpenSSL "libssl" library provides implementations of several secure network communications protocols.
       Specifically it provides SSL/TLS (SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3), DTLS (DTLSv1 and DTLSv1.2)
       and QUIC (client side only). The library depends on "libcrypto" for its underlying cryptographic
       operations (see <b><a href="../man7/ossl-guide-libcrypto-introduction.7.html">ossl-guide-libcrypto-introduction</a></b>(7)).

       The set of APIs supplied by "libssl" is common across all of these different network protocols, so a
       developer familiar with writing applications using one of these protocols should be able to transition to
       using another with relative ease.

       An application written to use "libssl" will include the <u>&lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;</u> header file and will typically
       use two main data structures, i.e. <b>SSL</b> and <b>SSL_CTX</b>.

       An <b>SSL</b> object is used to represent a connection to a remote peer. Once a connection with a remote peer
       has been established data can be exchanged with that peer.

       When using DTLS any data that is exchanged uses "datagram" semantics, i.e.  the packets of data can be
       delivered in any order, and they are not guaranteed to arrive at all. In this case the <b>SSL</b> object used
       for the connection is also used for exchanging data with the peer.

       Both TLS and QUIC support the concept of a "stream" of data. Data sent via a stream is guaranteed to be
       delivered in order without any data loss. A stream can be uni- or bi-directional.

       SSL/TLS only supports one stream of data per connection and it is always bi-directional. In this case the
       <b>SSL</b> object used for the connection also represents that stream. See <b><a href="../man7/ossl-guide-tls-introduction.7.html">ossl-guide-tls-introduction</a></b>(7) for
       more information.

       The QUIC protocol can support multiple streams per connection and they can be uni- or bi-directional. In
       this case an <b>SSL</b> object can represent the underlying connection, or a stream, or both. Where multiple
       streams are in use a separate <b>SSL</b> object is used for each one. See <b><a href="../man7/ossl-guide-quic-introduction.7.html">ossl-guide-quic-introduction</a></b>(7) for
       more information.

       An <b>SSL_CTX</b> object is used to create the <b>SSL</b> object for the underlying connection. A single <b>SSL_CTX</b> object
       can be used to create many connections (each represented by a separate <b>SSL</b> object). Many API functions in
       libssl exist in two forms: one that takes an <b>SSL_CTX</b> and one that takes an <b>SSL</b>.  Typically settings that
       you apply to the <b>SSL_CTX</b> will then be inherited by any <b>SSL</b> object that you create from it. Alternatively
       you can apply settings directly to the <b>SSL</b> object without affecting other <b>SSL</b> objects. Note that you
       should not normally make changes to an <b>SSL_CTX</b> after the first <b>SSL</b> object has been created from it.

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>STRUCTURES</b></h4><pre>
       As well as <b>SSL_CTX</b> and <b>SSL</b> there are a number of other data structures that an application may need to
       use. They are summarised below.

       <b>SSL_METHOD</b> (SSL Method)
           This  structure  is  used to indicate the kind of connection you want to make, e.g.  whether it is to
           represent the client or the server, and whether it is to use SSL/TLS, DTLS or QUIC. It is passed as a
           parameter when creating the <b>SSL_CTX</b>.

       <b>SSL_SESSION</b> (SSL Session)
           After establishing a connection with a peer the agreed cryptographic material can be reused to create
           future connections with the same peer more rapidly. The set of data used for such a future connection
           establishment attempt  is  collected  together  into  an  <b>SSL_SESSION</b>  object.  A  single  successful
           connection  with  a  peer  may  generate  zero  or  more  such  <b>SSL_SESSION</b> objects for use in future
           connection attempts.

       <b>SSL_CIPHER</b> (SSL Cipher)
           During connection establishment the client and server agree upon cryptographic  algorithms  they  are
           going  to  use for encryption and other uses. A single set of cryptographic algorithms that are to be
           used together is known as a ciphersuite. Such a set is represented by an <b>SSL_CIPHER</b> object.

           The set of available ciphersuites that can be used are configured in the <b>SSL_CTX</b> or <b>SSL</b>.
