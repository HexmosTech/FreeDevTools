</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       float.h — floating types

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;float.h&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  characteristics of floating types are defined in terms of a model that describes a representation of
       floating-point numbers and values that  provide  information  about  an  implementation's  floating-point
       arithmetic.

       The following parameters are used to define the model for each floating-point type:

       <u>s</u>     Sign (±1).

       <u>b</u>     Base or radix of exponent representation (an integer &gt;1).

       <u>e</u>     Exponent (an integer between a minimum <u>e</u>_min and a maximum <u>e</u>_max).

       <u>p</u>     Precision (the number of base-<u>b</u> digits in the significand).

       <u>f</u>_<u>k</u>   Non-negative integers less than <u>b</u> (the significand digits).

       A floating-point number <u>x</u> is defined by the following model:

       <u>x</u> = <u>sb^e</u>  <u>kpf</u>_<u>k</u>  <u>b^</u> −<u>k</u>, <u>e</u>_min  ≤ <u>e</u> ≤ <u>e</u>_max

       In  addition  to  normalized floating-point numbers (<u>f</u>_1&gt;0 if <u>x</u>≠0), floating types may be able to contain
       other kinds of floating-point numbers, such as subnormal floating-point numbers (<u>x</u>≠0, <u>e</u>=<u>e</u>_min, <u>f</u>_1=0) and
       unnormalized floating-point numbers (<u>x</u>≠0,  <u>e</u>&gt;<u>e</u>_min,  <u>f</u>_1=0),  and  values  that  are  not  floating-point
       numbers,  such  as  infinities  and  NaNs.  A  <u>NaN</u>  is  an  encoding signifying Not-a-Number. A <u>quiet</u> <u>NaN</u>
       propagates through almost every arithmetic  operation  without  raising  a  floating-point  exception;  a
       <u>signaling</u> <u>NaN</u> generally raises a floating-point exception when occurring as an arithmetic operand.

       An implementation may give zero and non-numeric values, such as infinities and NaNs, a sign, or may leave
       them  unsigned.  Wherever  such values are unsigned, any requirement in POSIX.1‐2008 to retrieve the sign
       shall produce an unspecified sign and any requirement to set the sign shall be ignored.

       The accuracy of the floating-point operations (<b>'+'</b>, <b>'-'</b>, <b>'*'</b>, <b>'/'</b>) and of the functions in  <u>&lt;math.h&gt;</u>  and
       <u>&lt;complex.h&gt;</u>  that  return  floating-point  results  is  implementation-defined, as is the accuracy of the
       conversion between floating-point internal representations and string representations  performed  by  the
       functions  in  <u>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</u>,  <u>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</u>,  and <u>&lt;wchar.h&gt;</u>.  The implementation may state that the accuracy is
       unknown.

       All integer values in the <u>&lt;float.h&gt;</u> header, except FLT_ROUNDS, shall be constant expressions suitable for
       use in <b>#if</b> preprocessing directives; all floating  values  shall  be  constant  expressions.  All  except
       DECIMAL_DIG,  FLT_EVAL_METHOD, FLT_RADIX, and FLT_ROUNDS have separate names for all three floating-point
       types. The floating-point model representation is provided for  all  values  except  FLT_EVAL_METHOD  and
       FLT_ROUNDS.

       The  rounding  mode  for  floating-point addition is characterized by the implementation-defined value of
       FLT_ROUNDS:

       -1    Indeterminable.

        0    Toward zero.

        1    To nearest.

        2    Toward positive infinity.

        3    Toward negative infinity.

       All other values for FLT_ROUNDS characterize implementation-defined rounding behavior.

       The values of operations with floating operands and values subject to the  usual  arithmetic  conversions
       and  of  floating  constants  are  evaluated  to  a  format whose range and precision may be greater than
       required by the type. The use of evaluation formats is characterized by the implementation-defined  value
       of FLT_EVAL_METHOD:

       -1    Indeterminable.

        0    Evaluate all operations and constants just to the range and precision of the type.

        1    Evaluate operations and constants of type <b>float</b> and <b>double</b> to the range and precision of the <b>double</b>
             type;  evaluate  <b>long</b> <b>double</b> operations and constants to the range and precision of the <b>long</b> <b>double</b>
             type.

        2    Evaluate all operations and constants to the range and precision of the <b>long</b> <b>double</b> type.

       All other negative values for FLT_EVAL_METHOD characterize implementation-defined behavior.

       The <u>&lt;float.h&gt;</u> header shall define the following  values  as  constant  expressions  with  implementation-
       defined  values  that  are  greater  or equal in magnitude (absolute value) to those shown, with the same
       sign.

           LDBL_MANT_DIG

        *  Number of decimal digits, <u>n</u>, such that any floating-point number in  the  widest  supported  floating
           type  with  <u>p</u>_max  radix <u>b</u> digits can be rounded to a floating-point number with <u>n</u> decimal digits and
           back again without change to the value.

           <u>p</u>_max  <u>log</u>_10  <u>b</u>         if <u>b</u> <u>is</u> <u>a</u> <u>power</u> <u>of</u> 10
           <u>⎡</u> 1 + <u>p</u>_max  <u>log</u>_10  <u>b⎤</u>  <u>otherwise</u>
           DECIMAL_DIG   10

        *  Number of decimal digits, <u>q</u>, such that any floating-point number with <u>q</u> decimal digits can be rounded
           into a floating-point number with <u>p</u> radix <u>b</u> digits and back again without change  to  the  <u>q</u>  decimal
           digits.

           <u>p</u> <u>log</u>_10  <u>b</u>            if <u>b</u> <u>is</u> <u>a</u> <u>power</u> <u>of</u> 10

           FLT_DIG       6

           DBL_DIG       10

           LDBL_DIG      10

        *  Minimum  negative  integer such that FLT_RADIX raised to that power minus 1 is a normalized floating-
           point number, <u>e</u>_min.

           FLT_MIN_EXP

           DBL_MIN_EXP

           LDBL_MIN_EXP

        *  Minimum negative integer such that 10 raised to that power is in the range  of  normalized  floating-
           point numbers.

           as large as DBL_MANT_DIG, and LDBL_MAX_EXP shall be at least as large as LDBL_MANT_DIG; which has the
           effect that FLT_MAX, DBL_MAX, and LDBL_MAX are integral.

        *  Maximum  integer  such that 10 raised to that power is in the range of representable finite floating-

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       All known hardware floating-point formats satisfy the property that the exponent range is larger than the
       number  of mantissa digits. The ISO C standard permits a floating-point format where this property is not
       true, such that the largest finite value would not be integral; however, it is unlikely that  there  will
       ever be hardware support for such a floating-point format, and it introduces boundary cases that portable
       programs  should  not  have  to  be concerned with (for example, a non-integral DBL_MAX means that <u>ceil</u>()
       would have to worry about overflow). Therefore, this standard imposes an additional requirement that  the
       largest representable finite value is integral.
