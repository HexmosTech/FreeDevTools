</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       GrokEVT - a collection of scripts built for reading windows event log files.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  document  serves  as  an overview to using the GrokEVT suite of tools. Please see the man pages for
       each tool for specific command-line options.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b></h4><pre>
       Using GrokEVT on a set of windows partitions  is  a  three  stage  process.  One  must  first  mount  the
       partitions  and  configure  the  system's  profile.  Next,  <a href="../man1/grokevt-builddb.1.html">grokevt-builddb</a>(1) must be run to extract the
       necessary information from these partitions.   Finally,  <a href="../man1/grokevt-parselog.1.html">grokevt-parselog</a>(1)  may  be  run  to  use  this
       information to convert the logs to something useful.

       <u>Mounting</u> <u>and</u> <u>configuration:</u>

       This is the most labor-intensive step of the process. There are several technical reasons why this cannot
       be  simpler, and it is unlikely many will be resolved anytime soon. (Sorry, blame the vendor who produced
       these logs that you wish to convert.)

       First mount the partitions used by your windows system.   Specifically,  mount  any  partition  that  has
       software  installed  on  it.  (You  can  probably get away with not mounting ones with no software, or no
       software that produces events in the event log.)  This includes windows shares,  if  you  have  any  with
       software installed on them.

       The  key  point  when  mounting  partitions  or shares, is that you must mount them with case-insensitive
       filenames. To do this in Linux, you should be able to use the NTFS option 'posix=0', or  with  type  vfat
       this  appears to be the default. On FreeBSD, one can use the -i option with NTFS and mount_ntfs, but this
       hasn't been tested. (More research is necessary in this area. Please let me know if case-insensitivity is
       available on other *NIXes and what the options are.) All of this, of course, depends on your  version  of
       mount and related software. See <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a>(8) for more information.

       Once  you have all necessary filesystems mounted for your windows image, you need to configure GrokEVT so
       it knows where everything  is.  If  you  look  in  the  main  configuration  directory,  (by  default  at
       '/usr/local/etc/grokevt')  you'll  find  a  sub-directory  called  'systems'. In there is a set of system
       configuration profiles. Each directory under 'systems' represents the configuration for a single  windows
       host.   You  may create directories here of any name. It is suggested you use the host name of the system
       you wish to extract logs from.

       By default, there will be one system configuration there already, named 'example'. I suggest you  make  a
       full copy of this, and edit it from there to create your own configuration:

              # cd /usr/local/etc/grokevt/systems
              # cp -r example mysystem

       Now that you have your own configuration, take a look at the files under this directory:

              path-vars/%SystemRoot%
              system-registry
              drives/c:
              drives/d:

       Each  file  represents  a  single configuration setting. The first line of every file is the setting, all
       others are ignored. You should start by configuring your drive letters. These drive letters need  to  map
       to  the *NIX path of the drives. So, if you mounted your C: partition under '/mnt/win/c', then you should
       do the following:

              echo /mnt/win/c &gt; drives/c:

       This will of course, overwrite that file with your actual mount point for the C: drive. Do this  for  all
       drives mounted on your windows system.

       Next,  you  need to configure your %SystemRoot% path variable.  Since the registry often references files
       in relation to this variable, we need to know where it is on your system.  Typically, on W2K this  should
       be  'C:\WINNT'.  On  other windows systems it is often 'C:\Windows'. This case-insensitive path must as a
       full windows path (including a drive letter).

       Finally, you need to set the path of the system registry. This path <u>must</u>  be  a  *NIX  path,  and  not  a
       windows  path,  and  it is case-sensitive. It should be located under your %SystemRoot%. For instance, if
       you   mount   a   W2K   machine's    C:    on    '/mnt/win/c',    this    path    will    probably    be:
       /mnt/win/c/WINNT/system32/config/system

       This will vary from system to system, but if you have ever done any forensics, you should be able to find
       the correct path pretty quickly.

       <u>Using</u> <u><a href="../man1/grokevt-builddb.1.html">grokevt-builddb</a>(1):</u>

       Once  you  get  past  the mounting and configuration step, you're in good shape. To extract the necessary
       information from the system you just mounted, you just need to decide where you want to store the  output
       database. Based on the example paths above, one could run <a href="../man1/grokevt-builddb.1.html">grokevt-builddb</a>(1) like so:

              grokevt-builddb mysystem /var/db/grokevt/mysystem

       Or something similar. This step will take some time, as a lot of files need to be parsed. You will likely
       get  some  warnings  about  missing DLLs and possibly service removals. This is normal if software on the
       windows system failed to clean up the registry correctly when it was  un-installed.  You  might  want  to
       record  this information though, if later you find you are missing a lot of message templates in your log
       output.

       Now that you have finished this step, you have fully extracted all information needed  to  interpret  the
       event logs.

       <u>Using</u> <u><a href="../man1/grokevt-parselog.1.html">grokevt-parselog</a>(1):</u>

       To  run  <a href="../man1/grokevt-parselog.1.html">grokevt-parselog</a>(1),  you  must  specify the database directory that you generated with <a href="../man1/grokevtbuilddb.1.html">grokevt-</a>
       <a href="../man1/grokevtbuilddb.1.html">builddb</a>(1). Initially, you will want to find out what event logs were extracted by running:

              grokevt-parselog -l /var/db/grokevt/mysystem

       This will print out all available event log types, based on information found previously in the  system's
       registry.  Then  you may view one of those logs simply by dropping the -l option, and adding it's name as
       the second parameter. For instance, to view the 'System' log:

              grokevt-parselog /var/db/grokevt/mysystem System

       See the <a href="../man1/grokevt-parselog.1.html">grokevt-parselog</a>(1) man page for further options.

       <u>Finding</u> <u>and</u> <u>Parsing</u> <u>Log</u> <u>Fragments:</u>

       One may find it useful to parse deleted log files or fragments of log files found in a system's RAM dump.
       A special-purpose tool, <a href="../man1/grokevt-findlogs.1.html">grokevt-findlogs</a>(1) is included in this  distribution  which  makes  finding  log
       fragments  easy.  It  can  find  even  a  single log record by itself with a relatively low rate of false
       positives.

       Suppose one has a file, dump.img, which contains an image of a system's RAM, or perhaps  the  unallocated
       blocks  of  a  filesystem (as might be produced by The SleuthKit's <a href="../man1/dls.1.html">dls</a>(1)). One could search this dump by
       running:

              grokevt-findlogs dump.img

       This will produce a listing of all hits in the file, which may include header records, cursor records, or
       log records, offsets and contiguity information to help one eliminate any false positives.

       Supposing we found a log fragment in this dump that we're interested in, we could  simply  use  <a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a>(1)  or
       some  other tool to carve out the relevant data in to a file named fragment.evt. We'd then need to find a
       way to associate this log with a set of message templates.  This is what <a href="../man1/grokevt-addlog.1.html">grokevt-addlog</a>(1) is for.  Let's
       take  a  guess  that  the fragment.evt was originally a part of System log. We would add the log into our
       previously built message database by running:

              grokevt-addlog /var/db/grokevt/mysystem fragment.evt System-fragment System

       Finally, we can parse the log by simply specifying the newly imported name with <a href="../man1/grokevt-parselog.1.html">grokevt-parselog</a>(1):

              grokevt-parselog /var/db/grokevt/mysystem System-fragment

       If we found that most of the log entries didn't have associated message templates (which would result  in
       lots  of  warnings  to stderr), we would be pretty that fragment.evt really wasn't based on a System log.
       Simply re-importing it as another log type (and a different name) would let us parse it again  as  if  it
       were of another type.

       Please see the <a href="../man1/grokevt-findlogs.1.html">grokevt-findlogs</a>(1) and <a href="../man1/grokevt-addlog.1.html">grokevt-addlog</a>(1) man pages for more information.
