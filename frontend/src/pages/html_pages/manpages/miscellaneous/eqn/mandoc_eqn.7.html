</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       eqn — eqn language reference for mandoc

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>eqn</b>  language  is an equation-formatting language.  It is used within <u><a href="../man7/mdoc.7.html">mdoc</a></u>(7) and <u><a href="../man7/man.7.html">man</a></u>(7) Unix manual
       pages.  It describes the <u>structure</u> of an equation, not its mathematical meaning.  This  manual  describes
       the  <b>eqn</b>  language  accepted  by  the  <u><a href="../man1/mandoc.1.html">mandoc</a></u>(1)  utility,  which  corresponds  to the Second Edition <b>eqn</b>
       specification (see “SEE ALSO” for references).

       An equation starts with an input line containing exactly the characters ‘.EQ’, may contain multiple input
       lines, and ends with an input line containing exactly the characters ‘.EN’.   Equivalently,  an  equation
       can  be  given  in  the middle of a single text input line by surrounding it with the equation delimiters
       defined with the <b>delim</b> statement.

       The equation grammar is as follows, where quoted strings are case-sensitive literals in the input:

             eqn     : box | eqn box
             box     : text
                     | "{" eqn "}"
                     | "define" text text
                     | "ndefine" text text
                     | "tdefine" text text
                     | "gfont" text
                     | "gsize" text
                     | "set" text text
                     | "undef" text
                     | "sqrt" box
                     | box pos box
                     | box mark
                     | "matrix" "{" [col "{" list "}"]* "}"
                     | pile "{" list "}"
                     | font box
                     | "size" text box
                     | "left" text eqn ["right" text]
             col     : "lcol" | "rcol" | "ccol" | "col"
             text    : [^space\"]+ | \".*\"
             pile    : "lpile" | "cpile" | "rpile" | "pile"
             pos     : "over" | "sup" | "sub" | "to" | "from"
             mark    : "dot" | "dotdot" | "hat" | "tilde" | "vec"
                     | "dyad" | "bar" | "under"
             font    : "roman" | "italic" | "bold" | "fat"
             list    : eqn
                     | list "above" eqn
             space   : [\^~ \t]

       White-space consists of the space, tab, circumflex, and tilde characters.   It  is  required  to  delimit
       tokens  consisting  of  alphabetic  characters and it is ignored at other places.  Braces and quotes also
       delimit tokens.  If within a quoted string, these space characters are retained.  Quoted strings are also
       not scanned for keywords, glyph names, and expansion of definitions.  To print a literal quote character,
       it can be prepended with a backslash or expressed with the \(dq escape sequence.

       Subequations can be enclosed in braces to pass  them  as  arguments  to  operation  keywords,  overriding
       standard  operation  precedence.  Braces can be nested.  To set a brace verbatim, it needs to be enclosed
       in quotes.

       The following text terms are translated into a rendered glyph, if available:  alpha,  beta,  chi,  delta,
       epsilon,  eta,  gamma, iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu, omega, omicron, phi, pi, psi, rho, sigma, tau, theta,
       upsilon, xi, zeta, DELTA,  GAMMA,  LAMBDA,  OMEGA,  PHI,  PI,  PSI,  SIGMA,  THETA,  UPSILON,  XI,  inter
       (intersection),  union  (union),  prod  (product),  int (integral), sum (summation), grad (gradient), del
       (vector  differential),  times  (multiply),  cdot  (center-dot),  nothing  (zero-width   space),   approx
       (approximately  equals),  prime (prime), half (one-half), partial (partial differential), inf (infinity),
       &gt;&gt; (much greater), &lt;&lt; (much less), &lt;- (left arrow), -&gt; (right arrow), +- (plus-minus), != (not equal), ==
       (equivalence), &lt;= (less-than-equal), and &gt;= (more-than-equal).  The character escape sequences documented
       in <u><a href="../man7/mandoc_char.7.html">mandoc_char</a></u>(7) can be used, too.

       The following control statements are available:

       <b>define</b>  Replace all occurrences of a key with a value.  Its syntax is as follows:

                     <b>define</b> <u>key</u> <u>cvalc</u>

               The first character of the value string, <u>c</u>, is used as the delimiter for  the  value  <u>val</u>.   This
               allows for arbitrary enclosure of terms (not just quotes), such as

                     <b>define</b> <u>foo</u> <u>'bar</u> <u>baz'</u>
                     <b>define</b> <u>foo</u> <u>cbar</u> <u>bazc</u>

               It  is  an  error  to have an empty <u>key</u> or <u>val</u>.  Note that a quoted <u>key</u> causes errors in some <b>eqn</b>
               implementations and should not be considered portable.  It  is  not  expanded  for  replacements.
               Definitions may refer to other definitions; these are evaluated recursively when text replacement
               occurs and not when the definition is created.

               Definitions can create arbitrary strings, for example, the following is a legal construction.

                     define foo 'define'
                     foo bar 'baz'

               Self-referencing definitions will raise an error.  The <b>ndefine</b> statement is a synonym for <b>define</b>,
               while <b>tdefine</b> is discarded.

       <b>delim</b>   This  statement  takes  a  string argument consisting of two bytes, to be used as the opening and
               closing delimiters for equations in the middle of text input lines.  Conventionally,  the  dollar
               sign is used for both delimiters, as follows:

                     .EQ
                     delim $$
                     .EN
                     An equation like $sin pi = 0$ can now be entered
                     in the middle of a text input line.

               The  special statement <b>delim</b> <b>off</b> temporarily disables previously declared delimiters and <b>delim</b> <b>on</b>
               reenables them.

       <b>gfont</b>   Set the default font of subsequent output.  Its syntax is as follows:

                     <b>gfont</b> <u>font</u>

               In mandoc, this value is discarded.

       <b>gsize</b>   Set the default size of subsequent output.  Its syntax is as follows:

                     <b>gsize</b> [+|-]<u>size</u>

               The <u>size</u> value should be an integer.  If prepended by a sign, the font size is  changed  relative
               to the current size.

       <b>set</b>     Set an equation mode.  In mandoc, both arguments are thrown away.  Its syntax is as follows:

                     <b>set</b> <u>key</u> <u>val</u>

               The <u>key</u> and <u>val</u> are not expanded for replacements.  This statement is a GNU extension.

       <b>undef</b>   Unset a previously-defined key.  Its syntax is as follows:

                     <b>define</b> <u>key</u>

               Once  invoked,  the  definition  for <u>key</u> is discarded.  The <u>key</u> is not expanded for replacements.
               This statement is a GNU extension.

       Operation keywords have the following semantics:

       <b>above</b>   See <b>pile</b>.

       <b>bar</b>     Draw a line over the preceding box.

       <b>bold</b>    Set the following box using bold font.

       <b>ccol</b>    Like <b>cpile</b>, but for use in <b>matrix</b>.

       <b>cpile</b>   Like <b>pile</b>, but with slightly increased vertical spacing.

       <b>dot</b>     Set a single dot over the preceding box.

       <b>dotdot</b>  Set two dots (dieresis) over the preceding box.

       <b>dyad</b>    Set a dyad symbol (left-right arrow) over the preceding box.

       <b>fat</b>     A synonym for <b>bold</b>.

       <b>font</b>    Set the second argument using the font specified by the first argument; currently not  recognized
               by the <u><a href="../man1/mandoc.1.html">mandoc</a></u>(1) <b>eqn</b> parser.

       <b>from</b>    Set  the  following  box  below the preceding box, using a slightly smaller font.  Used for sums,
               integrals, limits, and the like.

       <b>hat</b>     Set a hat (circumflex) over the preceding box.

       <b>italic</b>  Set the following box using italic font.

       <b>lcol</b>    Like <b>lpile</b>, but for use in <b>matrix</b>.

       <b>left</b>    Set the first argument as a big left delimiter before the second argument.  As an optional  third
               argument,  <b>right</b>  can  follow.  In that case, the fourth argument is set as a big right delimiter
               after the second argument.

       <b>lpile</b>   Like <b>cpile</b>, but subequations are left-justified.

       <b>matrix</b>  Followed by a list of columns enclosed in braces.  All columns need to have the  same  number  of
               subequations.   The  columns are set as a matrix.  The difference compared to multiple subsequent
               <b>pile</b> operators  is  that  in  a  <b>matrix</b>,  corresponding  subequations  in  all  columns  line  up
               horizontally, while each <b>pile</b> does vertical spacing independently.

       <b>over</b>    Set a fraction.  The preceding box is the numerator, the following box is the denominator.

       <b>pile</b>    Followed  by a list of subequations enclosed in braces, the subequations being separated by <b>above</b>
               keywords.  Sets the subequations one above the other, each of them centered.  Typically  used  to
               represent vectors in coordinate representation.

       <b>rcol</b>    Like <b>rpile</b>, but for use in <b>matrix</b>.

       <b>right</b>   See  <b>left</b>;  <b>right</b>  cannot  be used without <b>left</b>.  To set a big right delimiter without a big left
               delimiter, the following construction can be used:

                     <b>left</b> "" <u>box</u> <b>right</b> <u>delimiter</u>

       <b>roman</b>   Set the following box using the default font.

       <b>rpile</b>   Like <b>cpile</b>, but subequations are right-justified.

       <b>size</b>    Set the second argument with the font size specified by the first argument; currently ignored  by
               <u><a href="../man1/mandoc.1.html">mandoc</a></u>(1).   By  prepending  a  plus  or  minus  sign to the first argument, the font size can be
               selected relative to the current size.

       <b>sqrt</b>    Set the square root of the following box.

       <b>sub</b>     Set the following box as a subscript to the preceding box.

       <b>sup</b>     Set the following box as a superscript to the preceding box.  As a special case, if a <b>sup</b>  clause
               immediately follows a <b>sub</b> clause as in

                     <u>mainbox</u> <b>sub</b> <u>subbox</u> <b>sup</b> <u>supbox</u>

               both are set with respect to the same <u>mainbox</u>, that is, <u>supbox</u> is set above <u>subbox</u>.

       <b>tilde</b>   Set a tilde over the preceding box.

       <b>to</b>      Set  the following box above the preceding box, using a slightly smaller font.  Used for sums and
               integrals and the like.  As a special case, if a <b>to</b> clause immediately follows a <b>from</b>  clause  as
               in

                     <u>mainbox</u> <b>from</b> <u>frombox</u> <b>to</b> <u>tobox</u>

               both are set below and above the same <u>mainbox</u>.

       <b>under</b>   Underline the preceding box.

       <b>vec</b>     Set a vector symbol (right arrow) over the preceding box.

       The binary operations <b>from</b>, <b>to</b>, <b>sub</b>, and <b>sup</b> group to the right, that is,

             <u>mainbox</u> <b>sup</b> <u>supbox</u> <b>sub</b> <u>subbox</u>

       is the same as

             <u>mainbox</u> <b>sup</b> {<u>supbox</u> <b>sub</b> <u>subbox</u>}

       and different from

             {<u>mainbox</u> <b>sup</b> <u>supbox</u>} <b>sub</b> <u>subbox</u>.

       By contrast, <b>over</b> groups to the left.

       In the following list, earlier operations bind more tightly than later operations:

       1.   <b>dyad</b>, <b>vec</b>, <b>under</b>, <b>bar</b>, <b>tilde</b>, <b>hat</b>, <b>dot</b>, <b>dotdot</b>
       2.   <b>fat</b>, <b>roman</b>, <b>italic</b>, <b>bold</b>, <b>size</b>
       3.   <b>sub</b>, <b>sup</b>
       4.   <b>sqrt</b>
       5.   <b>over</b>
       6.   <b>from</b>, <b>to</b>

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  documents  the compatibility of mandoc <b>eqn</b> and the troff <b>eqn</b> implementation (including GNU
       troff).

       <b>-</b>   The text string ‘\"’ is interpreted as a literal quote in troff.  In mandoc, this is interpreted as a
           comment.
       <b>-</b>   In troff, The circumflex and tilde white-space symbols map to fixed-width spaces.  In  mandoc,  these
           characters are synonyms for the space character.
       <b>-</b>   The  troff  implementation  of  <b>eqn</b>  allows  for  equation alignment with the <b>mark</b> and <b>lineup</b> tokens.
           mandoc discards these tokens.  The <b>back</b> <u>n</u>, <b>fwd</b> <u>n</u>, <b>up</b> <u>n</u>, and <b>down</b> <u>n</u> commands are also ignored.

       The  eqn  utility,  a preprocessor for troff, was originally written by Brian W. Kernighan and Lorinda L.
       Cherry in 1975.  The GNU reimplementation of eqn, part of the GNU troff package, was released in 1989  by
       James Clark.  The eqn component of <u><a href="../man1/mandoc.1.html">mandoc</a></u>(1) was added in 2011.
