</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       udev - Dynamic device management

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       udev supplies the system software with device events, manages permissions of device nodes and may create
       additional symlinks in the <a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a> directory, or renames network interfaces. The kernel usually just
       assigns unpredictable device names based on the order of discovery. Meaningful symlinks or network device
       names provide a way to reliably identify devices based on their properties or current configuration.

       The udev daemon, <b><a href="../man8/systemd-udevd.service.8.html">systemd-udevd.service</a></b>(8), receives device uevents directly from the kernel whenever a
       device is added or removed from the system, or it changes its state. When udev receives a device event,
       it matches its configured set of rules against various device attributes to identify the device. Rules
       that match may provide additional device information to be stored in the udev database or to be used to
       create meaningful symlink names.

       All device information udev processes is stored in the udev database and sent out to possible event
       subscribers. Access to all stored data and the event sources is provided by the library libudev.

</pre><h4><b>RULES</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The udev rules are read from the files located in the system rules directories <a href="file:/usr/lib/udev/rules.d">/usr/lib/udev/rules.d</a> and
       /usr/local/lib/udev/rules.d, the volatile runtime directory <a href="file:/run/udev/rules.d">/run/udev/rules.d</a> and the local
       administration directory /etc/udev/rules.d. All rules files are collectively sorted and processed in
       lexical order, regardless of the directories in which they live. However, files with identical filenames
       replace each other. Files in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> have the highest priority, files in <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a> take precedence over files
       with the same name under <a href="file:/usr/.">/usr/.</a> This can be used to override a system-supplied rules file with a local
       file if needed; a symlink in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> with the same name as a rules file in <a href="file:/usr/lib/">/usr/lib/</a>, pointing to
       /dev/null, disables the rules file entirely. Rule files must have the extension .rules; other extensions
       are ignored.

       Every line in the rules file contains at least one key-value pair. Except for empty lines or lines
       beginning with "#", which are ignored. There are two kinds of keys: match and assignment. If all match
       keys match against their values, the rule gets applied and the assignment keys get the specified values
       assigned.

       A matching rule may rename a network interface, add symlinks pointing to the device node, or run a
       specified program as part of the event handling.

       A rule consists of a comma-separated list of one or more key-operator-value expressions. Each expression
       has a distinct effect, depending on the key and operator used.

   <b>Operators</b>
       "=="
           Compare for equality. (The specified key has the specified value.)

       "!="
           Compare for inequality. (The specified key does not have the specified value, or the specified key is
           not present at all.)

       "="
           Assign a value to a key. Keys that represent a list are reset and only this single value is assigned.

       "+="
           Add the value to a key that holds a list of entries.

       "-="
           Remove the value from a key that holds a list of entries.

           Added in version 217.

       ":="
           Assign a value to a key finally; disallow any later changes.

           Added in version 247.

   <b>Values</b>
       Values are written as double quoted strings, such as ("string"). To include a quotation mark (") in the
       value, precede it by a backslash (\"). Any other occurrences of a backslash followed by a character are
       not unescaped. That is, "\t\n" is treated as four characters: backslash, lowercase t, backslash,
       lowercase n.

       The string can be prefixed with a lowercase e (e"string\n") to mark the string as C-style escaped, see
       <b>Escape</b> <b>sequences</b> <b>in</b> <b>C</b>[1]. For example, e"string\n" is parsed as 7 characters: 6 lowercase letters and a
       newline. This can be useful for writing special characters when a kernel driver requires them.

       The string can be prefixed with a lowercase i (i"string") to mark that the string or pattern will match
       case-insensitively. For example, i"foo" will match "foo", "FOO", "FoO" and so on. The prefix can be used
       only for match ("==") or unmatch ("!=") rules, e.g.  <u>ATTR{foo}==i"abcd"</u>.

       Please note that <b>NUL</b> is not allowed in either string variant.

   <b>Keys</b>
       The following key names can be used to match against device properties. Some of the keys also match
       against properties of the parent devices in sysfs, not only the device that has generated the event. If
       multiple keys that match a parent device are specified in a single rule, all these keys must match at one
       and the same parent device.

       <u>ACTION</u>
           Match the name of the event action.

       <u>DEVPATH</u>
           Match the devpath of the event device.

       <u>KERNEL</u>
           Match the name of the event device.

       <u>KERNELS</u>
           Search the devpath upwards for a matching device name.

       <u>NAME</u>
           Match the name of a network interface. It can be used once the NAME key has been set in one of the
           preceding rules.

       <u>SYMLINK</u>
           Match the name of a symlink targeting the node. It can be used once a SYMLINK key has been set in one
           of the preceding rules. There may be multiple symlinks; only one needs to match. If the operator is
           "!=", the token returns true only if there is no symlink matched.

       <u>SUBSYSTEM</u>
           Match the subsystem of the event device.

       <u>SUBSYSTEMS</u>
           Search the devpath upwards for a matching device subsystem name.

       <u>DRIVER</u>
           Match the driver name of the event device. Only set this key for devices which are bound to a driver
           at the time the event is generated.

       <u>DRIVERS</u>
           Search the devpath upwards for a matching device driver name.

       <u>ATTR{filename}</u>
           Match sysfs attribute value of the event device.

           Trailing whitespace in the attribute values is ignored unless the specified match value itself
           contains trailing whitespace.

       <u>ATTRS{filename}</u>
           Search the devpath upwards for a device with matching sysfs attribute values. If multiple <u>ATTRS</u>
           matches are specified, all of them must match on the same device.

           Trailing whitespace in the attribute values is ignored unless the specified match value itself
           contains trailing whitespace.

       <u>SYSCTL{kernel</u> <u>parameter}</u>
           Match a kernel parameter value.

           Added in version 240.

       <u>ENV{key}</u>
           Match against a device property value.

       <u>CONST{key}</u>
           Match against a system-wide constant. Supported keys are:

           "arch"
               System's architecture. See <b>ConditionArchitecture=</b> in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5) for possible values.

               Added in version 244.

           "virt"
               System's virtualization environment. See <b><a href="../man1/systemd-detect-virt.1.html">systemd-detect-virt</a></b>(1) for possible values.

               Added in version 244.

           "cvm"
               System's confidential virtualization technology. See <b><a href="../man1/systemd-detect-virt.1.html">systemd-detect-virt</a></b>(1) for possible values.

               Added in version 254.

           Unknown keys will never match.

           Added in version 244.

       <u>TAG</u>
           Match against one of device tags. It can be used once a TAG key has been set in one of the preceding
           rules. There may be multiple tags; only one needs to match. If the operator is "!=", the token
           returns true only if there is no tag matched.

       <u>TAGS</u>
           Search the devpath upwards for a device with matching tag. If the operator is "!=", the token returns
           true only if there is no tag matched.

       <u>TEST{octal</u> <u>mode</u> <u>mask}</u>
           Test the existence of a file. An octal mode mask can be specified if needed.

       <u>PROGRAM</u>
           Execute a program to determine whether there is a match; the key is true if the program returns
           successfully. The device properties are made available to the executed program in the environment.
           The program's standard output is available in the <u>RESULT</u> key.

           This can only be used for very short-running foreground tasks. For details, see <u>RUN</u>.

           Note that multiple <u>PROGRAM</u> keys may be specified in one rule, and "=", ":=", and "+=" have the same
           effect as "==".

       <u>RESULT</u>
           Match the returned string of the last <u>PROGRAM</u> call. This key can be used in the same or in any later
           rule after a <u>PROGRAM</u> call.

       Most of the fields support shell glob pattern matching and alternate patterns. The following special
       characters are supported:

       "*"
           Matches zero or more characters.

       "?"
           Matches any single character.

       "[]"
           Matches any single character specified within the brackets. For example, the pattern string "tty[SR]"
           would match either "ttyS" or "ttyR". Ranges are also supported via the "-" character. For example, to
           match on the range of all digits, the pattern "[0-9]" could be used. If the first character following
           the "[" is a "!", any characters not enclosed are matched.

       "|"
           Separates alternative patterns. For example, the pattern string "abc|x*" would match either "abc" or
           "x*".

           Added in version 217.

       The following keys can get values assigned:

       <u>NAME</u>
           The name to use for a network interface. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.link.5.html">systemd.link</a></b>(5) for a higher-level mechanism for setting
           the interface name. The name of a device node cannot be changed by udev, only additional symlinks can
           be created.

       <u>SYMLINK</u>
           The name of a symlink targeting the node. Every matching rule adds this value to the list of symlinks
           to be created.

           The set of characters to name a symlink is limited. Allowed characters are "0-9A-Za-z#+-.:=@_/",
           valid UTF-8 character sequences, and "\x00" hex encoding. All other characters are replaced by a "_"
           character.

           Multiple symlinks may be specified by separating the names by the space character. In case multiple
           devices claim the same name, the link always points to the device with the highest link_priority. If
           the current device goes away, the links are re-evaluated and the device with the next highest
           link_priority becomes the owner of the link. If no link_priority is specified, the order of the
           devices (and which one of them owns the link) is undefined.

           Symlink names must never conflict with the kernel's default device node names, as that would result
           in unpredictable behavior.

       <u>OWNER</u>, <u>GROUP</u>, <u>MODE</u>
           The permissions for the device node. Every specified value overrides the compiled-in default value.

       <u>SECLABEL{module}</u>
           Applies the specified Linux Security Module label to the device node.

           Added in version 209.

       <u>ATTR{key}</u>
           The value that should be written to a sysfs attribute of the event device.

       <u>SYSCTL{kernel</u> <u>parameter}</u>
           The value that should be written to kernel parameter.

           Added in version 220.

       <u>ENV{key}</u>
           Set a device property value. Property names with a leading "."  are neither stored in the database
           nor exported to events or external tools (run by, for example, the <u>PROGRAM</u> match key).

       <u>TAG</u>
           Attach a tag to a device. This is used to filter events for users of libudev's monitor functionality,
           or to enumerate a group of tagged devices. The implementation can only work efficiently if only a few
           tags are attached to a device. It is only meant to be used in contexts with specific device filter
           requirements, and not as a general-purpose flag. Excessive use might result in inefficient event
           handling.

       <u>RUN{type}</u>
           Specify a program to be executed after processing of all the rules for the event. With "+=", this
           invocation is added to the list, and with "=" or ":=", it replaces any previous contents of the list.
           Please note that both "program" and "builtin" types described below share a common list, so clearing
           the list with ":=" and "=" affects both types.

           <u>type</u> may be:

           "program"
               Execute an external program specified as the assigned value. If no absolute path is given, the
               program is expected to live in <a href="file:/usr/lib/udev">/usr/lib/udev</a>; otherwise, the absolute path must be specified.

               This is the default if no <u>type</u> is specified.

           "builtin"
               As <u>program</u>, but use one of the built-in programs rather than an external one.

               Added in version 199.

           The program name and following arguments are separated by spaces. Single quotes can be used to
           specify arguments with spaces.

           This can only be used for very short-running foreground tasks. Running an event process for a long
           period of time may block all further events for this or a dependent device.

           Note that running programs that access the network or mount/unmount filesystems is not allowed inside
           of udev rules, due to the default sandbox that is enforced on systemd-udevd.service.

           Starting daemons or other long-running processes is not allowed; the forked processes, detached or
           not, will be unconditionally killed after the event handling has finished. In order to activate
           long-running processes from udev rules, provide a service unit and pull it in from a udev device
           using the <u>SYSTEMD_WANTS</u> device property. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.device.5.html">systemd.device</a></b>(5) for details.

       <u>LABEL</u>
           A named label to which a <u>GOTO</u> may jump.

       <u>GOTO</u>
           Jumps to the next <u>LABEL</u> with a matching name.

       <u>IMPORT{type}</u>
           Import a set of variables as device properties, depending on <u>type</u>:

           "program"
               Execute an external program specified as the assigned value and, if it returns successfully,
               import its output, which must be in environment key format. Path specification, command/argument
               separation, and quoting work like in <u>RUN</u>.

               Added in version 199.

           "builtin"
               Similar to "program", but use one of the built-in programs rather than an external one.

               Added in version 199.

           "file"
               Import a text file specified as the assigned value, the content of which must be in environment
               key format.

           "db"
               Import a single property specified as the assigned value from the current device database. This
               works only if the database is already populated by an earlier event.

           "cmdline"
               Import a single property from the kernel command line. For simple flags the value of the property
               is set to "1".

           "parent"
               Import the stored keys from the parent device by reading the database entry of the parent device.
               The value assigned to <b>IMPORT{parent}</b> is used as a filter of key names to import (with the same
               shell glob pattern matching used for comparisons).

           This can only be used for very short-running foreground tasks. For details see <b>RUN</b>.

           Note that multiple <u>IMPORT{}</u> keys may be specified in one rule, and "=", ":=", and "+=" have the same
           effect as "==". The key is true if the import is successful, unless "!=" is used as the operator
           which causes the key to be true if the import failed.

       <u>OPTIONS</u>
           Rule and device options:

           <b>link_priority=</b><u>value</u>
               Specify the priority of the created symlinks. Devices with higher priorities overwrite existing
               symlinks of other devices. The default is 0.

           <b>string_escape=</b><u>none|replace</u>
               When "replace", possibly unsafe characters in strings assigned to <u>NAME</u>, <u>SYMLINK</u>, and <u>ENV{key}</u> are
               replaced. When "none", no replacement is performed. When unset, the replacement is performed for
               <u>NAME</u>, <u>SYMLINK</u>, but not for <u>ENV{key}</u>. Defaults to unset.

           <b>static_node=</b>
               Apply the permissions specified in this rule to the static device node with the specified name.
               Also, for every tag specified in this rule, create a symlink in the directory
               <a href="file:/run/udev/static_node-tags/">/run/udev/static_node-tags/</a><u>tag</u> pointing at the static device node with the specified name. Static
               device node creation is performed by systemd-tmpfiles before systemd-udevd is started. The static
               nodes might not have a corresponding kernel device; they are used to trigger automatic kernel
               module loading when they are accessed.

           <b>watch</b>
               Watch the device node with inotify; when the node is closed after being opened for writing, a
               change uevent is synthesized.

           <b>nowatch</b>
               Disable the watching of a device node with inotify.

           <b>db_persist</b>
               Set the flag (sticky bit) on the udev database entry of the event device. Device properties are
               then kept in the database even when <b>udevadm</b> <b>info</b> <b>--cleanup-db</b> is called. This option can be
               useful in certain cases (e.g. Device Mapper devices) for persisting device state on the
               transition from initrd.

               Added in version 241.

           <b>log_level=</b><u>level</u>
               Takes a log level name like "debug" or "info", or a special value "reset". When a log level name
               is specified, the maximum log level is changed to that level. When "reset" is set, then the
               previously specified log level is revoked. Defaults to the log level of the main process of
               <b>systemd-udevd</b>.

               This may be useful when debugging events for certain devices. Note that the log level is applied
               when the line including this rule is processed. So, for debugging, it is recommended that this is
               specified at earlier place, e.g., the first line of 00-debug.rules.

               Example for debugging uevent processing for network interfaces:

                   # /etc/udev/rules.d/00-debug-net.rules
                   SUBSYSTEM=="net", OPTIONS="log_level=debug"

               Added in version 248.

       The <u>ENV</u>, <u>GROUP</u>, <u>MODE</u>, <u>NAME</u>, <u>OWNER</u>, <u>PROGRAM</u>, <u>RUN</u>, <u>SECLABEL</u>, and <u>SYMLINK</u> fields support simple string
       substitutions. The <u>RUN</u> substitutions are performed after all rules have been processed, right before the
       program is executed, allowing for the use of device properties set by earlier matching rules. For all
       other fields, substitutions are performed while the individual rule is being processed. The available
       substitutions are:

       <b>$kernel</b>, <b>%k</b>
           The kernel name for this device.

       <b>$number</b>, <b>%n</b>
           The kernel number for this device. For example, "sda3" has kernel number 3.

       <b>$devpath</b>, <b>%p</b>
           The devpath of the device.

       <b>$id</b>, <b>%b</b>
           The name of the device matched while searching the devpath upwards for <b>SUBSYSTEMS</b>, <b>KERNELS</b>, <b>DRIVERS</b>,
           and <b>ATTRS</b>.

       <b>$driver</b>
           The driver name of the device matched while searching the devpath upwards for <b>SUBSYSTEMS</b>, <b>KERNELS</b>,
           <b>DRIVERS</b>, and <b>ATTRS</b>.

       <b>$attr{</b><u>file</u><b>}</b>, <b>%s{</b><u>file</u><b>}</b>
           The value of a sysfs attribute found at the device where all keys of the rule have matched. If the
           matching device does not have such an attribute, and a previous <b>KERNELS</b>, <b>SUBSYSTEMS</b>, <b>DRIVERS</b>, or
