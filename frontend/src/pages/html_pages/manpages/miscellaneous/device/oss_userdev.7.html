</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>oss_userdev</b> - OSS client/server audio pseudo device.

</pre><h4><b>NOTICE</b></h4><pre>
       This  audio device is not designed to be used as-is by the users. It requires a specially designed server
       application that implements the actual service (please see the OSS  programming  documentation  for  more
       info).  The  server application will then create the audio devices that can be used to record and/or play
       audio.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The oss_userdev driver is a special purpose loop back audio device that can be used when implementing OSS
       audio devices based on a server running in the background.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       â€¢  userdev_visible_clientnodes=0|1     By     default     (0)     common     client      device      node
          (/dev/oss/oss_userdev0/client)  will  be  created  for all server instances. The clients will then get
          directed to the right instance based on some search criteria (for example UID).  This  alternative  is
          best when using single server application that can serve large number of different sesions.

       If  this  option  is  set  to  1  then  OSS  will  create separate client device nodes for each instance.
       Applications will have to open the right device nodes. This alternative is best when oss_userdev is  used
       to  create  different kind of services in one system. In this way for example a VoIP link can be accessed
       by opening a different device node than when opening some other service.
