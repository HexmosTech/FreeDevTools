       XPAChanges - Changes For Users from XPA 1.0 and 2.0

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes changes that will affect users who migrate from XPA 1.0 to XPA 2.0.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       There have been a few changes that affect users who upgrade XPA from version 1.0 to version 2.0.  These
       changes are detailed below.

       •   XPA commands no longer have a resolver routine (this is open to negotiations, but we decided the idea
           was  dumb).   For  the  SAOtng program, this means that you must explicitly specify the access point,
           i.e.,:

             cat foo.fits | xpaset SAOtng fits

           instead of:

             cat foo.fits | xpaset SAOtng

       •   By default, xpaset, xpaget, etc. now wait for the server callback to complete; i.e., the  old  -W  is
           implied  (and  the  switch  is ignored).  This allows support for better error handling.  If you want
           xpaset, etc.  to return before the callback is complete, use -n switch:

             echo "file foo.fits" | xpaset -n SAOtng

       •   The old -w switch in xpaset and xpaget is no longer necessary (and is ignored), since  you  can  have
           more than one process communicating with an xpa access point at one time.

       •   The new -p switch on xpaset means you need not read from stdout:

             xpaset -p SAOtng colormap I8

           will send the paramlist to the SAOtng callback without reading from stdin.
