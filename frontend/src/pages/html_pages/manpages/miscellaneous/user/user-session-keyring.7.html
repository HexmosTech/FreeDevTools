</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       user-session-keyring - per-user default session keyring

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The user session keyring is a keyring used to anchor keys on behalf of a user.  Each UID the kernel deals
       with  has  its  own user session keyring that is shared by all processes with that UID.  The user session
       keyring has a name (description)  of  the  form  <b>_</b><u>uid_ses.&lt;UID&gt;</u>  where  <u>&lt;UID&gt;</u>  is  the  user  ID  of  the
       corresponding user.

       The  user  session keyring is associated with the record that the kernel maintains for the UID.  It comes
       into existence upon the first attempt to access either the user session keyring, the <b><a href="../man7/user-keyring.7.html">user-keyring</a></b>(7),  or
       the  <b><a href="../man7/session-keyring.7.html">session-keyring</a></b>(7).   The keyring remains pinned in existence so long as there are processes running
       with that real UID or files opened by those processes remain open.   (The  keyring  can  also  be  pinned
       indefinitely by linking it into another keyring.)

       The  user  session  keyring  is created on demand when a thread requests it or when a thread asks for its
       <b><a href="../man7/session-keyring.7.html">session-keyring</a></b>(7) and that keyring doesn't exist.  In the latter case, a user session  keyring  will  be
       created  and,  if  the  session keyring wasn't to be created, the user session keyring will be set as the
       process's actual session keyring.

       The user session keyring is searched by <b><a href="../man2/request_key.2.html">request_key</a></b>(2) if the actual session keyring does not  exist  and
       is ignored otherwise.

       A  special serial number value, <b>KEY_SPEC_USER_SESSION_KEYRING</b>, is defined that can be used in lieu of the
       actual serial number of the calling process's user session keyring.

       From the <b><a href="../man1/keyctl.1.html">keyctl</a></b>(1) utility, '<b>@us</b>' can be used instead of a numeric key ID in much the same way.

       User session keyrings are independent of <b><a href="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/vfork.2.html">vfork</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></b>(2), and  <b><a href="../man2/_exit.2.html">_exit</a></b>(2)  excepting
       that the keyring is destroyed when the UID record is destroyed when the last process pinning it exits.

       If a user session keyring does not exist when it is accessed, it will be created.

       Rather  than relying on the user session keyring, it is strongly recommended—especially if the process is
       running as root—that a <b><a href="../man7/session-keyring.7.html">session-keyring</a></b>(7) be set explicitly, for example by <b><a href="../man8/pam_keyinit.8.html">pam_keyinit</a></b>(8).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The user session keyring was added to support situations where a process doesn't have a session  keyring,
       perhaps  because  it  was  created  via  a pathway that didn't involve PAM (e.g., perhaps it was a daemon
       started by <b><a href="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd</a></b>(8)).  In such a scenario, the  user  session  keyring  acts  as  a  substitute  for  the
       <b><a href="../man7/session-keyring.7.html">session-keyring</a></b>(7).
