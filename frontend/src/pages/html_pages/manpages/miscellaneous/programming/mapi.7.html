       mapi — Message Application Programming Interface

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       MAPI is a programming language API for storing and exchanging messages, contacts and calendars.

</pre><h4><b>Data</b> <b>model</b></h4><pre>
       The MAPI data model is a hierarchial one, similar to LDAP or a filesystem.

       A store is a container for a tree-based hierarchy of objects, similar to a filesystem. Each object in the
       hierarchy  has  an  identifier  by  which  it can be referred to, the so-called entry ID. The entry ID is
       unique within the scope of a store and can be thought of something like a filesystem's inode number.

       Each object can have a number of attributes (key-value pairs), so-called properties.

</pre><h4><b>Differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>MSMAPI</b> <b>and</b> <b>MAPI4Linux</b></h4><pre>
       •   MAPI4Linux is a C++-only implementation. It is not binary compatible to MSMAPI, but  it  does  remain
           source  compatible to it, so that MAPI programs can, with little extra code, compile with both MSMAPI
           and M4L.

       •   M4L uses multiple virtual inheritance.

       •   Many MAPI functions in M4L have additional "const" qualifiers that MSMAPI  is  lacking.  This  allows
           programs  to  be  sure  memory is not unexpectedly modified behind the scenes and allows them to pass
           pointers to read-only memory as well.
