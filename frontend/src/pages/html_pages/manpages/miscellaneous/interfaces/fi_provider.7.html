       fi_provider - Fabric Interface Providers

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       See <b><a href="../man7/fi_arch.7.html">fi_arch</a></b>(7) for a brief description of how providers fit into the libfabric architecture.

       Conceptually,  a  fabric provider implements and maps the libfabric API over lower-level network software
       and/or hardware.  Most application calls into the libfabric API go directly into a provider’s implementa‐
       tion of that API.

       Libfabric providers are grouped into different type: core, utility, hooking, and offload.  These are  de‐
       scribe  in  more  detail  below.  The following diagram illustrates the architecture between the provider
       types.

              ---------------------------- libfabric API ----------------------------
                [core]   provider|&lt;- [hooking provider]
              [services]   API   |  --- libfabric API ---
                                 |&lt;- [utility provider]
                                 |  ---------------- libfabric API ------------------
                                 |&lt;-  [core provider] &lt;-peer API-&gt; [offload provider]

       All providers plug into libfabric using an exported  provider  API.   libfabric  supports  both  internal
       providers,  which  ship  with  the library for user convenience, as well as external providers.  External
       provider libraries must be in the library search path, end with the suffix “-fi”, and export the function
       fi_prov_ini().

       Once registered with the libfabric core, a provider will be reported to applications as part of the  dis‐
       covery  process.   Hooking  and  utility providers will intercept libfabric calls from the application to
       perform some task before calling through to the next provider.  If there’s no need to intercept a specif‐
       ic API call, the application will call directly  to  the  core  provider.   Where  possible  provider  to
       provider  communication  is  done using the libfabric APIs itself, including the use of provider specific
       extensions to reduce call overhead.

       libfabric defines a set of APIs that specifically target providers that may be used as peers.  These APIs
       are oddly enough called peer APIs.  Peer APIs are technically part of the external libfabric API, but are
       not designed for direct use by applications and are not considered stable for API backwards  compatibili‐
       ty.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Providers</b></h4><pre>
       Core  providers  are  stand-alone  providers  that usually target a specific class of networking devices.
       That is, a specific NIC, class  of  network  hardware,  or  lower-level  software  interface.   The  core
       providers  are usually what most application developers are concerned with.  Core providers may only sup‐
       port libfabric features and interfaces that map efficiently to the underlying hardware or network  proto‐
       cols.

       The  following  core providers are built into libfabric by default, assuming all build pre-requisites are
       met.  That is, necessary libraries are installed, operating system support is available, etc.  This  list
       is not exhaustive.

       <u>CXI</u>    Provider for Cray’s Slingshot network.  See <b><a href="../man7/fi_cxi.7.html">fi_cxi</a></b>(7) for more information.

       <u>EFA</u>    A  provider  for  the Amazon EC2 Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) (https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/efa/), a
              custom-built OS bypass hardware interface for inter-instance communication on EC2.  See  <b><a href="../man7/fi_efa.7.html">fi_efa</a></b>(7)
              for more information.

       <u>LPP</u>    A provider runs on FabreX PCIe networks.  See <b><a href="../man7/fi_lpp.7.html">fi_lpp</a></b>(7) for more information.

       <u>OPX</u>    Supports Omni-Path networking from Cornelis Networks.  See <b><a href="../man7/fi_opx.7.html">fi_opx</a></b>(7) for more information.

       <u>PSM2</u>   Older provider for Omni-Path networks.  See <b><a href="../man7/fi_psm2.7.html">fi_psm2</a></b>(7) for more information.

       <u>PSM3</u>   Provider for Ethernet networking from Intel.  See <b><a href="../man7/fi_psm3.7.html">fi_psm3</a></b>(7) for more information.

       <u>SHM</u>    A provider for intra-node communication using shared memory.  See <b><a href="../man7/fi_shm.7.html">fi_shm</a></b>(7) for more information.

       <u>TCP</u>    A  provider  which  runs  over the TCP/IP protocol and is available on multiple operating systems.
              This provider enables develop of libfabric applications on most platforms.  See <b><a href="../man7/fi_tcp.7.html">fi_tcp</a></b>(7) for more
              information.

       <u>UCX</u>    A provider which runs over the UCX library which is currently supported by Infiniband fabrics from
              NVIDIA.  See <b><a href="../man7/fi_ucx.7.html">fi_ucx</a></b>(7) for more information.

       <u>UDP</u>    A provider which runs over the UDP/IP protocol and is available  on  multiple  operating  systems.
              This provider enables develop of libfabric applications on most platforms.  See <b><a href="../man7/fi_udp.7.html">fi_udp</a></b>(7) for more
              information.

       <u>Verbs</u>  This  provider  targets  RDMA NICs for both Linux and Windows platforms.  See <b><a href="../man7/fi_verbs.7.html">fi_verbs</a></b>(7) for more
              information.

</pre><h4><b>Utility</b> <b>Providers</b></h4><pre>
       Utility providers are named with a starting prefix of “ofi_”.  Utility providers are distinct  from  core
       providers  in that they are not associated with specific classes of devices.  They instead work with core
       providers to expand their features and interact with core providers through libfabric  interfaces  inter‐
       nally.  Utility providers are used to support a specific endpoint type over a simpler endpoint type.

       Utility  providers show up as part of the return’s provider’s name.  See <b><a href="../man3/fi_fabric.3.html">fi_fabric</a></b>(3).  Utility providers
       are enabled automatically for core providers that do not support the feature set requested by an applica‐
       tion.

       <u>RxM</u>    Implements RDM endpoint semantics over MSG endpoints.  See <b><a href="../man7/fi_rxm.7.html">fi_rxm</a></b>(7) for more information.

       <u>RxD</u>    Implements RDM endpoint semantis over DGRAM endpoints.  See <b><a href="../man7/fi_rxd.7.html">fi_rxd</a></b>(7) for more information.

</pre><h4><b>Hooking</b> <b>Providers</b></h4><pre>
       Hooking providers are mostly used for debugging purposes.  Since hooking providers are built and included
       in release versions of libfabric, they are always available and have no impact on performance unless  en‐
       abled.  Hooking providers can layer over all other providers and intercept, or hook, their calls in order
       to  perform some dedicated task, such as gathering performance data on call paths or providing debug out‐
       put.

       See <b><a href="../man7/fi_hook.7.html">fi_hook</a></b>(7) for more information.

</pre><h4><b>Offload</b> <b>Providers</b></h4><pre>
       Offload providers start with the naming prefix “off_”.  An offload provider is meant to  be  paired  with
       other  core  and/or  utility  providers.  An offload provider is intended to accelerate specific types of
       communication, generally by taking advantage of network services that have been offloaded into  hardware,
       though actual hardware offload support is not a requirement.

</pre><h4><b>LINKx</b> <b>(LNX)</b> <b>provider</b> <b>(Technology</b> <b>Preview)</b></h4><pre>
       The  LNX provider is designed to link two or more providers, allowing applications to seamlessly use mul‐
       tiple providers or NICs.  This provider uses the libfabric peer infrastructure to aid in the use  of  the
       underlying providers.  This version of the provider currently supports linking the libfabric shared memo‐
       ry  provider  for intra-node traffic and another provider for inter-node traffic.  Future releases of the
       provider will allow linking any number of providers and provide the users with the ability  to  influence
       the way the providers are utilized for traffic load.
