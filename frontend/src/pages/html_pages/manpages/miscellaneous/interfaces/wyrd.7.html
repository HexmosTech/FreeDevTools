   <b>1</b> <b>Introduction</b>

       Wyrd  is  a  text-based front-end to Remind , a sophisticated calendar and alarm program. Wyrd serves two
       purposes:

       1) It displays reminders in a scrollable timetable view suitable  for  visualizing  your  calendar  at  a
       glance.
       2)  It  makes creating and editing reminders fast and easy. However, Wyrd does not hide Remind's textfile
       programmability, for this is what makes Remind a truly powerful calendaring system.

       Wyrd also requires only a fraction of the resources of most calendar programs available today.

   <b>2</b> <b>Installation</b>

       This section describes how to install Wyrd by compiling from source. Wyrd has been packaged for a  number
       of  popular  Linux/Unix  variants,  so  you  may  be able to save yourself some time by installing from a
       package provided by your OS distribution.

       Wyrd is designed to be portable to most Unix-like operating systems, including GNU/Linux, *BSD,  and  Mac
       OS X. Before installing Wyrd, your system must have the following software installed:

       • OCaml
        &gt;= 4.08
       • the ncurses library
        (and development headers)
       • OCaml Curses

       • Remind
        &gt;= 4.0.0
       • GNU make

       • the Unix pager application, less

       After  installing  the  OCaml compiler, Wyrd may be compiled and installed through any of the following 3
       methods:

    <b>2.1</b> <b>Method</b> <b>1:</b> <b>GNU</b> <b>make</b> <b>and</b> <b>OCaml</b> <b>findlib</b>

       1)     Install     the     OCaml      findlib      package      for      your      operating      system:
       https://repology.org/project/findlib/related
       2)      Install      the      OCaml      curses      package      for      your     operating     system:
       https://repology.org/project/ocaml:curses/versions
       3) Execute the following commands at the root of the source tree:

            export PREFIX=<a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>
          make
          make install

         On the BSDs, GNU make is usually available under the name gmake instead of make.

    <b>2.2</b> <b>Method</b> <b>2:</b> <b>Dune</b>

       1) Install the Dune package for your operating system: https://repology.org/project/dune/versions
       2)     Install     the      OCaml      curses      package      for      your      operating      system:
       https://repology.org/project/ocaml:curses/versions
       3) Execute the following commands at the root of the source tree:

            export WYRD_SYSCONFDIR=<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>
          dune build --release
          dune install --prefix=<a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> --sections=bin

    <b>2.3</b> <b>Method</b> <b>3:</b> <b>OPAM</b>

       1) Install the OPAM package for your operating system: https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html
       2) Execute the following commands at the root of the source tree:

            opam init -c ocaml-system -n
          opam install -y ./wyrd.opam

       3) Wyrd may then be started with this command:

            opam exec wyrd

   <b>3</b> <b>Quick</b> <b>Start</b>

       This  section  describes  how to use Wyrd in its default configuration. After familiarizing yourself with
       the basic operations as outlined in this  section,  you  may  wish  to  consult  the  <u>Configuration</u>  <u>File</u>
       documentation to see how Wyrd can be configured to better fit your needs.

   <b>4</b> <b>Overview</b>

       Before  attempting  to  use  Wyrd,  learn how to use Remind. Wyrd makes no attempt to hide the details of
       Remind programming from the user. Aside from reading the Remind manpage, you may get some useful pointers
       by reading Mike Harris's article on 43 Folders , Dianne Skoll's writeup on Linux Journal , or  the Remind
       Wiki

       You  can  launch Wyrd using the default reminder file by executing wyrd. If desired, a different reminder
       file (or reminder directory) may be selected by executing wyrd &lt;filename&gt;.

       At the top of the window is a short (incomplete) list of keybindings.

       The left window displays a scrollable timetable view, with reminders highlighted in  various  colors.  If
       the DURATION specifier is used for a reminder, the highlighted area is rendered with an appropriate size.
       Overlapping  reminders  are rendered using one of four different indentation levels so that all reminders
       are at least partially visible. If the current time is visible in this window, it is highlighted in red.

       The upper right window displays a month calendar, with the color of each day representing the  number  of
       reminders  it  contains.  The  colors  range  across  shades of white to blue to magenta as the number of
       reminders increases. The selected date is highlighted in cyan; if the current  date  is  visible,  it  is
       highlighted in red.

       The lower right window displays a list of the untimed reminders falling on the selected date.

       The  bottom  window  displays  the  full text of the MSG for the reminder or reminders that are currently
       selected.

   <b>5</b> <b>Navigation</b>

       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       Action                                  Keypress
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       scroll up and down the schedule         &lt;up&gt;, &lt;down&gt; or k, j
       jump back or forward by a day           &lt;pageup&gt;, &lt;pagedown&gt; or 4, 6 or &lt;,  &gt;
                                               or H, L
       jump back or forward by a week          8, 2 or [, ] or K, J
       jump back or forward by a month         {, }
       jump to current date and time           &lt;home&gt;
       jump to the next reminder               &lt;tab&gt;
       switch  between  schedule and untimed   &lt;left&gt;, &lt;right&gt; or h, l
       reminders window
       zoom in on the schedule                 z
       scroll the description window up  and   d, D
       down
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

       Notice  that  if  you have a numeric keypad, the {4, 6, 8, 2} keys will let you move directionally in the
       month calendar view at the upper-right of the screen. Similarly, {H, J,  K,  L}  will  cause  directional
       calendar movement using the standard mapping from <a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a>(1).

       In  addition  to the hotkeys provided above, Wyrd lets you jump immediately to a desired date by pressing
       'g', entering in a date specifier, and then pressing &lt;return&gt;. Any of the following date  specifiers  may
       be used:

       • 8 digits representing year, month, and day: YYYYMMDD
       • 4 digits representing month and day (of current year): MMDD
       • 2 digits representing day (of current month and year): DD

       (The date specifier format may be changed to DDMMYYYY; consult the section on <u>Configuration</u> <u>Variables</u>.)

   <b>6</b> <b>Editing</b> <b>Reminders</b>

       Note: By default, Wyrd is configured to modify your reminder files using the text editor specified by the
       $EDITOR  environment  variable.  (This configuration has been tested successfully with a number of common
       settings for $EDITOR, including 'vim', 'emacs', and 'nano'.) If you wish to use a different  editor,  see
       <u>Configuration</u> <u>File</u>.

       If  you  select  a  timeslot  in  the  schedule  view,  then hit 't', you will begin creating a new timed
       reminder. Wyrd will open up your reminder file in your favorite editor and move the cursor to the end  of
       the  file,  where  a  new reminder template has been created. The template has the selected date and time
       filled in, so in many cases you will only need to fill in a MSG value.

       Similarly, hitting 'u' will begin creating an untimed reminder. 'w' will create a weekly timed  reminder,
       and  'W'  will  create  a weekly untimed reminder; 'm' will create a monthly timed reminder, and 'M' will
       create a monthly untimed reminder.

       The keys 'T' and 'U' also create timed and untimed reminders (respectively), but  first  will  provide  a
       selection  dialog  for  you  to  choose  which reminder file you want to add this reminder to. The set of
       reminder files is determined by scanning the INCLUDE lines in your default reminder file. (If you  use  a
       reminder  directory,  then  all  *.rem  files in that directory will be available along with all INCLUDEd
       files.)

       If you select a reminder (either timed or  untimed)  and  hit  &lt;return&gt;,  you  will  begin  editing  that
       reminder.  Wyrd  will  open  up  the appropriate reminders file in your editor and move the cursor to the
       corresponding REM line.

       If you select a timeslot that contains multiple overlapping reminders, Wyrd will provide  a  dialog  that
       allows you to select the desired reminder.

       If  you  hit  &lt;enter&gt;  on  a  blank  timeslot,  Wyrd  will begin creating a new timed or untimed reminder
       (depending on whether the timed or the untimed window is selected).

       Finally, pressing 'e' will open the reminder file  in  your  editor  without  attempting  to  select  any
       particular reminder.

   <b>7</b> <b>Quick</b> <b>Reminders</b>

       Wyrd offers an additional mode for entering simple reminders quickly. Press 'q', and you will be prompted
       for  an  event  description.  Simply enter a description for the event using natural language, then press
       &lt;return&gt;. Examples:

       • meeting with Bob tomorrow at 11
       • drop off package at 3pm
       • Wednesday 10am-11:30 go grocery shopping
       • Board game night 20:15 next Fri
       • 7/4 independence day
       • 7/4/2007 independence day (next year)
       • independence day (next year) on 2007-07-04

       If your event description can be understood, Wyrd will immediately create the  reminder  and  scroll  the
       display to its location.

       Currently  the  quick  reminder  mode tends to favor USA English conventions, as generalizing the natural
       language parser would require some work.

       Wyrd also allows you to use the "quick reminder" syntax to create new reminders from  the  command  line,
       using the -a or --add options. For example,

          wyrd --add "dinner with neighbors tomorrow at 7pm"

       would  create a new reminder for tomorrow evening. When used in this mode, Wyrd exits silently with error
       code 0 if the reminder was successfully created. If the reminder  could  not  be  created  (e.g.  if  the
       reminder syntax could not be parsed), Wyrd prints an error message and exits with a nonzero error code.

   <b>8</b> <b>Cutting</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pasting</b> <b>Reminders</b>

       Reminders can be easily duplicated or rescheduled through the use of Wyrd's cutting and pasting features.

       Selecting  a reminder and pressing 'X' will cut that reminder: the corresponding REM line is deleted from
       your reminders file, and the reminder is copied to Wyrd's clipboard. To copy a reminder without  deleting
       it, use 'y' instead.

       To  paste  a  reminder  from  the  clipboard back into your schedule, just move the cursor to the desired
       date/time and press 'p'. Wyrd will append a new REM line to the end of your reminders file, and open  the
       file  with  your  editor.  The REM line will be configured to trigger on the selected date. If the copied
       reminder was timed, then the pasted reminder will be set to  trigger  at  the  selected  time  using  the
       original  DURATION  setting.  (Additional  Remind  settings such as delta and tdelta are not preserved by
       copy-and-paste.)

       If you wish to paste a reminder into a non-default reminders file, use 'P'. This will spawn  a  selection
       dialog where you can choose the file that will hold the new reminder.

       <b>WARNING</b>: Cutting a reminder will delete only the single REM command responsible for triggering it. If you
       are  using  more  complicated Remind scripting techniques to generate a particular reminder, then the cut
       operation may not do what you want.

   <b>9</b> <b>Viewing</b> <b>Reminders</b>

       Aside from viewing reminders as they fall in the schedule, you  can  press  'r'  to  view  all  reminders
       triggered  on  the selected date in a <a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a>(1) window. Similarly, 'R' will view all reminders triggered on
       or after the selected date (all non-expired reminders are triggered).

       If you want to get a more global view of your schedule, Wyrd will also let you  view  Remind's  formatted
       calendar  output  in  a  <a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a>(1)  window.  Pressing  'c'  will view a one-week calendar that contains the
       selected date, while pressing 'C' will view a one-month calendar containing the selected date.

   <b>10</b> <b>Searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>Reminders</b>

       Wyrd allows you to search for reminders with MSG values that match a search string. Press  '/'  to  start
       entering  a  (case insensitive) regular expression. After the expression has been entered, press &lt;return&gt;
       and Wyrd will locate the next reminder that matches the regexp. Press 'n'  to  repeat  the  same  search.
       Entry of a search string may be cancelled with &lt;esc&gt; or Ctrl-g.

       The regular expression syntax is Emacs-compatible.

       Note: Sorry, there is no "search backward" function. The search function requires the use of "remind -n",
       which  operates only forward in time. For the same reason, there is a command to jump forward to the next
       reminder, but no command to jump backward to the previous reminder.

   <b>11</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Commands</b>

       A list of all keybindings may be viewed by pressing '?'. You can exit Wyrd by pressing 'Q'. If the screen
       is corrupted for some reason, hit 'Ctrl-L' to refresh the display.

   <b>12</b> <b>Alarm</b> <b>Strategies</b>

       You may wish to generate some sort of alarm when a reminder is triggered. Wyrd does not offer any special
       alarm functionality, because Remind can handle the job already. Check the Remind manpage and consider how
       the -k option could be used to generate alarms with the  aid  of  external  programs.  For  example,  the
       following command will generate a popup window using <a href="../man1/gxmessage.1.html">gxmessage</a>(1) whenever a timed reminder is triggered:

          remind -z -k'gxmessage -title "reminder" %s &amp;' <a href="file:~/.reminders">~/.reminders</a> &amp;

       (A  sensible  way to start this alarm command is to place it in <a href="file:~/.xinitrc">~/.xinitrc</a> so that it launches when the X
       server is started.)

       If you want some advance warning (say, 15 minutes), you can cause Remind to trigger early  by  setting  a
       tdelta in the AT clause:

          REM Nov 27 2005 AT 14:30 +15 MSG Do something

       Alternatively,  if  you  want to generate alarms only for specific reminders, consider using Remind's RUN
       command. This process could be easily automated by using the templateN configuration variables  described
       in <u>Configuration</u> <u>File</u>.

   <b>13</b> <b>Miscellaneous</b>

       Remind's  TAG  specifier  may  be used to cause Wyrd to give special treatment to certain reminders. If a
       reminder line includes the clause "TAG noweight", then Wyrd will not give that reminder any  weight  when
       determining  the  "busy level" colorations applied to the month calendar. If a reminder line includes the
       clause "TAG nodisplay", then Wyrd will neither  display  that  reminder  nor  give  it  any  weight  when
       determining the month calendar colorations. The tag parameters are case insensitive.

       <b>WARNING</b>:  These  tag  parameters are not guaranteed to interact well with other Remind front-ends such as
       tkremind.

   <b>14</b> <b>Usage</b> <b>Tips</b>

       Wyrd fills in sensible defaults for the fields of a REM statement, but you will inevitably need  to  make
       some  small  edits  to  achieve  the  behavior you want. If you use Vim, you can make your life easier by
       installing the Vim-Latex Suite and then modifying your <a href="file:~/.wyrdrc">~/.wyrdrc</a> to use REM templates like this  (without
       the line break indicated by backslash):

          set timed_template="REM %monname% %mday% %year% &lt;++&gt;AT %hour%:%min%&lt;++&gt; \
             DURATION 1:00&lt;++&gt; MSG %\"&lt;++&gt;%\" %b"
          set untimed_template="REM %monname% %mday% %year% &lt;++&gt;MSG %\"&lt;++&gt;%\" %b"

       With  this  change, hitting Ctrl-J inside Vim (in insert mode) will cause your cursor to jump directly to
       the &lt;++&gt; markers, enabling you to quickly add any desired Remind delta and message parameters.

       There is a page on Wyrd
        in the Remind Wiki. This is a good place to look for other usage tips.
