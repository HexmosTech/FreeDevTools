       X.Org, XProjectTeam - X.Org Group information

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Release  6.5  and 6.6 of X Version 11 was brought to you by The X.Org Group.  Release 6.4 of X Version 11
       was brought to you by The X Project Team.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Open Group's X Project Team was created as the successor to the  X  Consortium,  Inc.,  after  the  X
       Consortium  ceased  operations  and  transferred  ownership  of  X11  to  The Open Group. The X.Org Group
       (hereinafter called "X.Org") was created as the successor to The X Project Team after the The Open  Group
       ceased  operating  The  X  Project  Team.  The purpose of X.Org was to foster development, evolution, and
       maintenance of the X Window System.  X.Org operates under the corporate umbrella of The Open Group.

       The X Consortium was an independent, not-for-profit Delaware membership corporation.  It  was  formed  in
       1993 as the successor to the MIT X Consortium.

       The  X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  In 1988,
       MIT formed a member-funded consortium to provide the technical and administrative leadership necessary to
       support further development of the X Window System.  In 1992, MIT and the membership decided  it  was  in
       their  best  interests  to  move  the  consortium  out  of  MIT  and  create  an independent, stand-alone
       organization.  All rights to the X Window System were assigned by MIT to X Consortium, Inc. on January 1,
       1994.  On December 31, 1996 the X Consortium, Inc.  closed its doors and  all  rights  to  the  X  Window
       System were assigned to The Open Group.
