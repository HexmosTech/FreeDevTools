       XOrgFoundation - X.Org Foundation information

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Release 6.7 and later of X Version 11 is brought to you by the X.Org Foundation.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  X.Org  Foundation is a member project of Software in the Public Interest (SPI), an independent, not-
       for-profit 501(c)(3) charity corporation.  It was formed in 2004 as the successor to the X.Org  Group  at
       The  Open  Group.  The  purpose  of  the  X.Org  Foundation  is to foster the development, evolution, and
       maintenance of the X Window System, a comprehensive set of vendor-neutral,  system-architecture  neutral,
       network-transparent  windowing  and  user interface standards. Membership in the X.Org Foundation is free
       and open to  anyone.  The  X.Org  Foundation  hosts  public  git  repositories  of  the  source  code  on
       freedesktop.org.

       The  X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  In 1988,
       MIT formed a member-funded consortium to provide the technical and administrative leadership necessary to
       support further development of the X Window System.  In 1992, MIT and the membership decided  it  was  in
       their  best  interests  to  move  the  consortium  out  of  MIT  and  create  an independent, stand-alone
       organization.  All rights to the X Window System were assigned by MIT to X Consortium, Inc. on January 1,
       1994. On December 31, 1996 the X Consortium, Inc. closed its doors and all rights to the X Window  System
       were assigned to The Open Group (then known as the Open Software Foundation).
