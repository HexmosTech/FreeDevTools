</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       derivations - book: Derivations of Applied Mathematics

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For  various valid reasons, open-source program sources rarely derive the mathematical formulas they use.
       A user, nevertheless -- not wishing to take such formulas on faith -- might wish  to  see  such  formulas
       <u>somewhere</u> derived.

       <u>Derivations</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>Applied</u>  <u>Mathematics</u>  is  a  book  that derives, and documents, many of the mathematical
       formulas and methods open-source programs use, and indeed many  of  the  formulas  and  methods  used  in
       science  and  engineering  generally.   For  example, it derives and documents the Taylor series (used to
       calculate trigonometrics), the Newton-Raphson method (used to calculate square  roots),  the  Pythagorean
       theorem (used to calculate distances) and many others.

</pre><h4><b>READING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>BOOK</b></h4><pre>
       Among   other   ways,   you   can   read   the   book  on  your  computer  screen  by  opening  the  file
       <u>/usr/share/doc/derivations/derivations.pdf</u> with a PDF reader like (for example) <b><a href="../man1/evince.1.html">evince</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/usr/share/doc/derivations/derivations.pdf</u>
              the book in PDF

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The book remains a work in progress.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       The book and this manpage are written by Thaddeus  H.  Black,  who  also  maintains  the  Debian  package
       <u>derivations</u> in which Debian distributes them.  Users who need to contact the author in his role as Debian
       package  maintainer  can reach him at &lt;<a href="mailto:thb@debian.org">thb@debian.org</a>&gt;.  However, most e-mail will naturally be about the
       book itself: this should be sent to &lt;<a href="mailto:thb@derivations.org">thb@derivations.org</a>&gt;.
