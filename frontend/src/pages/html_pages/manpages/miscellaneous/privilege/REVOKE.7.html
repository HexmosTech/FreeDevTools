         | SESSION_USER

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>REVOKE</b> command revokes previously granted privileges from one or more roles. The key word PUBLIC
       refers to the implicitly defined group of all roles.

       See the description of the <b>GRANT</b> command for the meaning of the privilege types.

       Note that any particular role will have the sum of privileges granted directly to it, privileges granted
       to any role it is presently a member of, and privileges granted to PUBLIC. Thus, for example, revoking
       SELECT privilege from PUBLIC does not necessarily mean that all roles have lost SELECT privilege on the
       object: those who have it granted directly or via another role will still have it. Similarly, revoking
       SELECT from a user might not prevent that user from using SELECT if PUBLIC or another membership role
       still has SELECT rights.

       If GRANT OPTION FOR is specified, only the grant option for the privilege is revoked, not the privilege
       itself. Otherwise, both the privilege and the grant option are revoked.

       If a user holds a privilege with grant option and has granted it to other users then the privileges held
       by those other users are called dependent privileges. If the privilege or the grant option held by the
       first user is being revoked and dependent privileges exist, those dependent privileges are also revoked
       if CASCADE is specified; if it is not, the revoke action will fail. This recursive revocation only
       affects privileges that were granted through a chain of users that is traceable to the user that is the
       subject of this REVOKE command. Thus, the affected users might effectively keep the privilege if it was
       also granted through other users.

       When revoking privileges on a table, the corresponding column privileges (if any) are automatically
       revoked on each column of the table, as well. On the other hand, if a role has been granted privileges on
       a table, then revoking the same privileges from individual columns will have no effect.

       When revoking membership in a role, GRANT OPTION is instead called ADMIN OPTION, but the behavior is
       similar. Note that, in releases prior to PostgreSQL 16, dependent privileges were not tracked for grants
       of role membership, and thus CASCADE had no effect for role membership. This is no longer the case. Note
       also that this form of the command does not allow the noise word GROUP in <u>role_specification</u>.

       Just as ADMIN OPTION can be removed from an existing role grant, it is also possible to revoke INHERIT
       OPTION or SET OPTION. This is equivalent to setting the value of the corresponding option to FALSE.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       A user can only revoke privileges that were granted directly by that user. If, for example, user A has
       granted a privilege with grant option to user B, and user B has in turn granted it to user C, then user A
       cannot revoke the privilege directly from C. Instead, user A could revoke the grant option from user B
       and use the CASCADE option so that the privilege is in turn revoked from user C. For another example, if
       both A and B have granted the same privilege to C, A can revoke their own grant but not B's grant, so C
       will still effectively have the privilege.

       When a non-owner of an object attempts to <b>REVOKE</b> privileges on the object, the command will fail outright
       if the user has no privileges whatsoever on the object. As long as some privilege is available, the
       command will proceed, but it will revoke only those privileges for which the user has grant options. The
       <b>REVOKE</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>PRIVILEGES</b> forms will issue a warning message if no grant options are held, while the other
       forms will issue a warning if grant options for any of the privileges specifically named in the command
       are not held. (In principle these statements apply to the object owner as well, but since the owner is
       always treated as holding all grant options, the cases can never occur.)

       If a superuser chooses to issue a <b>GRANT</b> or <b>REVOKE</b> command, the command is performed as though it were
       issued by the owner of the affected object. (Since roles do not have owners, in the case of a <b>GRANT</b> of
       role membership, the command is performed as though it were issued by the bootstrap superuser.) Since all
       privileges ultimately come from the object owner (possibly indirectly via chains of grant options), it is
       possible for a superuser to revoke all privileges, but this might require use of CASCADE as stated above.

       <b>REVOKE</b> can also be done by a role that is not the owner of the affected object, but is a member of the
       role that owns the object, or is a member of a role that holds privileges WITH GRANT OPTION on the
       object. In this case the command is performed as though it were issued by the containing role that
       actually owns the object or holds the privileges WITH GRANT OPTION. For example, if table t1 is owned by
       role g1, of which role u1 is a member, then u1 can revoke privileges on t1 that are recorded as being
       granted by g1. This would include grants made by u1 as well as by other members of role g1.

       If the role executing <b>REVOKE</b> holds privileges indirectly via more than one role membership path, it is
       unspecified which containing role will be used to perform the command. In such cases it is best practice
       to use <b>SET</b> <b>ROLE</b> to become the specific role you want to do the <b>REVOKE</b> as. Failure to do so might lead to
       revoking privileges other than the ones you intended, or not revoking anything at all.

       See Section 5.8 for more information about specific privilege types, as well as how to inspect objects'
       privileges.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Revoke insert privilege for the public on table films:

           REVOKE INSERT ON films FROM PUBLIC;

       Revoke all privileges from user manuel on view kinds:

           REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON kinds FROM manuel;

       Note that this actually means “revoke all privileges that I granted”.

       Revoke membership in role admins from user joe:

           REVOKE admins FROM joe;

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The compatibility notes of the <b>GRANT</b> command apply analogously to <b>REVOKE</b>. The keyword RESTRICT or CASCADE
       is required according to the standard, but PostgreSQL assumes RESTRICT by default.
