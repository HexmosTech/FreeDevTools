</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ALTER</b> <b>DEFAULT</b> <b>PRIVILEGES</b> allows you to set the privileges that will be applied to objects created in the
       future. (It does not affect privileges assigned to already-existing objects.) Privileges can be set
       globally (i.e., for all objects created in the current database), or just for objects created in
       specified schemas.

       While you can change your own default privileges and the defaults of roles that you are a member of, at
       object creation time, new object permissions are only affected by the default privileges of the current
       role, and are not inherited from any roles in which the current role is a member.

       As explained in Section 5.8, the default privileges for any object type normally grant all grantable
       permissions to the object owner, and may grant some privileges to PUBLIC as well. However, this behavior
       can be changed by altering the global default privileges with <b>ALTER</b> <b>DEFAULT</b> <b>PRIVILEGES</b>.

       Currently, only the privileges for schemas, tables (including views and foreign tables), sequences,
       functions, and types (including domains) can be altered. For this command, functions include aggregates
       and procedures. The words FUNCTIONS and ROUTINES are equivalent in this command. (ROUTINES is preferred
       going forward as the standard term for functions and procedures taken together. In earlier PostgreSQL
       releases, only the word FUNCTIONS was allowed. It is not possible to set default privileges for functions
       and procedures separately.)

       Default privileges that are specified per-schema are added to whatever the global default privileges are
       for the particular object type. This means you cannot revoke privileges per-schema if they are granted
       globally (either by default, or according to a previous <b>ALTER</b> <b>DEFAULT</b> <b>PRIVILEGES</b> command that did not
       specify a schema). Per-schema REVOKE is only useful to reverse the effects of a previous per-schema
       GRANT.

   <b>Parameters</b>
       <u>target_role</u>
           Change default privileges for objects created by the <u>target_role</u>, or the current role if unspecified.

       <u>schema_name</u>
           The name of an existing schema. If specified, the default privileges are altered for objects later
           created in that schema. If IN SCHEMA is omitted, the global default privileges are altered.  IN
           SCHEMA is not allowed when setting privileges for schemas, since schemas can't be nested.

       <u>role_name</u>
           The name of an existing role to grant or revoke privileges for. This parameter, and all the other
           parameters in <u>abbreviated_grant_or_revoke</u>, act as described under <b><a href="../man7/GRANT.7.html">GRANT</a></b>(7) or <b><a href="../man7/REVOKE.7.html">REVOKE</a></b>(7), except that
           one is setting permissions for a whole class of objects rather than specific named objects.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Use <b><a href="../man1/psql.1.html">psql</a></b>(1)'s <b>\ddp</b> command to obtain information about existing assignments of default privileges. The
       meaning of the privilege display is the same as explained for <b>\dp</b> in Section 5.8.

       If you wish to drop a role for which the default privileges have been altered, it is necessary to reverse
       the changes in its default privileges or use <b>DROP</b> <b>OWNED</b> <b>BY</b> to get rid of the default privileges entry for
       the role.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Grant SELECT privilege to everyone for all tables (and views) you subsequently create in schema myschema,
       and allow role webuser to INSERT into them too:

           ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA myschema GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO PUBLIC;
           ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA myschema GRANT INSERT ON TABLES TO webuser;

       Undo the above, so that subsequently-created tables won't have any more permissions than normal:

           ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA myschema REVOKE SELECT ON TABLES FROM PUBLIC;
           ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA myschema REVOKE INSERT ON TABLES FROM webuser;

       Remove the public EXECUTE permission that is normally granted on functions, for all functions
       subsequently created by role admin:

           ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE admin REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTIONS FROM PUBLIC;

       Note however that you <u>cannot</u> accomplish that effect with a command limited to a single schema. This
       command has no effect, unless it is undoing a matching GRANT:

           ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTIONS FROM PUBLIC;

       That's because per-schema default privileges can only add privileges to the global setting, not remove
       privileges granted by it.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       There is no <b>ALTER</b> <b>DEFAULT</b> <b>PRIVILEGES</b> statement in the SQL standard.
