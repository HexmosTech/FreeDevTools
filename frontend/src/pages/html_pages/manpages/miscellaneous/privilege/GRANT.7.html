</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>GRANT</b> command has two basic variants: one that grants privileges on a database object (table, column,
       view, foreign table, sequence, database, foreign-data wrapper, foreign server, function, procedure,
       procedural language, large object, configuration parameter, schema, tablespace, or type), and one that
       grants membership in a role. These variants are similar in many ways, but they are different enough to be
       described separately.

   <b>GRANT</b> <b>on</b> <b>Database</b> <b>Objects</b>
       This variant of the <b>GRANT</b> command gives specific privileges on a database object to one or more roles.
       These privileges are added to those already granted, if any.

       The key word PUBLIC indicates that the privileges are to be granted to all roles, including those that
       might be created later.  PUBLIC can be thought of as an implicitly defined group that always includes all
       roles. Any particular role will have the sum of privileges granted directly to it, privileges granted to
       any role it is presently a member of, and privileges granted to PUBLIC.

       If WITH GRANT OPTION is specified, the recipient of the privilege can in turn grant it to others. Without
       a grant option, the recipient cannot do that. Grant options cannot be granted to PUBLIC.

       If GRANTED BY is specified, the specified grantor must be the current user. This clause is currently
       present in this form only for SQL compatibility.

       There is no need to grant privileges to the owner of an object (usually the user that created it), as the
       owner has all privileges by default. (The owner could, however, choose to revoke some of their own
       privileges for safety.)

       The right to drop an object, or to alter its definition in any way, is not treated as a grantable
       privilege; it is inherent in the owner, and cannot be granted or revoked. (However, a similar effect can
       be obtained by granting or revoking membership in the role that owns the object; see below.) The owner
       implicitly has all grant options for the object, too.

       The possible privileges are:

       SELECT
       INSERT
       UPDATE
       DELETE
       TRUNCATE
       REFERENCES
       TRIGGER
       CREATE
       CONNECT
       TEMPORARY
       EXECUTE
       USAGE
       SET
       ALTER SYSTEM
       MAINTAIN
           Specific types of privileges, as defined in Section 5.8.

       TEMP
           Alternative spelling for TEMPORARY.

       ALL PRIVILEGES
           Grant all of the privileges available for the object's type. The PRIVILEGES key word is optional in
           PostgreSQL, though it is required by strict SQL.

       The FUNCTION syntax works for plain functions, aggregate functions, and window functions, but not for
       procedures; use PROCEDURE for those. Alternatively, use ROUTINE to refer to a function, aggregate
       function, window function, or procedure regardless of its precise type.

       There is also an option to grant privileges on all objects of the same type within one or more schemas.
       This functionality is currently supported only for tables, sequences, functions, and procedures.  ALL
       TABLES also affects views and foreign tables, just like the specific-object <b>GRANT</b> command.  ALL FUNCTIONS
       also affects aggregate and window functions, but not procedures, again just like the specific-object
       <b>GRANT</b> command. Use ALL ROUTINES to include procedures.

   <b>GRANT</b> <b>on</b> <b>Roles</b>
       This variant of the <b>GRANT</b> command grants membership in a role to one or more other roles, and the
       modification of membership options SET, INHERIT, and ADMIN; see Section 21.3 for details. Membership in a
       role is significant because it potentially allows access to the privileges granted to a role to each of
       its members, and potentially also the ability to make changes to the role itself. However, the actual
       permissions conferred depend on the options associated with the grant. To modify that options of an
       existing membership, simply specify the membership with updated option values.

       Each of the options described below can be set to either TRUE or FALSE. The keyword OPTION is accepted as
       a synonym for TRUE, so that WITH ADMIN OPTION is a synonym for WITH ADMIN TRUE. When altering an existing
       membership the omission of an option results in the current value being retained.

       The ADMIN option allows the member to in turn grant membership in the role to others, and revoke
       membership in the role as well. Without the admin option, ordinary users cannot do that. A role is not
       considered to hold WITH ADMIN OPTION on itself. Database superusers can grant or revoke membership in any
       role to anyone. This option defaults to FALSE.

       The INHERIT option controls the inheritance status of the new membership; see Section 21.3 for details on
       inheritance. If it is set to TRUE, it causes the new member to inherit from the granted role. If set to
       FALSE, the new member does not inherit. If unspecified when creating a new role membership, this defaults
       to the inheritance attribute of the new member.

       The SET option, if it is set to TRUE, allows the member to change to the granted role using the <b>SET</b> <b>ROLE</b>
       command. If a role is an indirect member of another role, it can use SET ROLE to change to that role only
       if there is a chain of grants each of which has SET TRUE. This option defaults to TRUE.

       To create an object owned by another role or give ownership of an existing object to another role, you
       must have the ability to SET ROLE to that role; otherwise, commands such as ALTER ... OWNER TO or CREATE
       DATABASE ... OWNER will fail. However, a user who inherits the privileges of a role but does not have the
       ability to SET ROLE to that role may be able to obtain full access to the role by manipulating existing
       objects owned by that role (e.g. they could redefine an existing function to act as a Trojan horse).
       Therefore, if a role's privileges are to be inherited but should not be accessible via SET ROLE, it
       should not own any SQL objects.

       If GRANTED BY is specified, the grant is recorded as having been done by the specified role. A user can
       only attribute a grant to another role if they possess the privileges of that role. The role recorded as
       the grantor must have ADMIN OPTION on the target role, unless it is the bootstrap superuser. When a grant
       is recorded as having a grantor other than the bootstrap superuser, it depends on the grantor continuing
       to possess ADMIN OPTION on the role; so, if ADMIN OPTION is revoked, dependent grants must be revoked as
       well.

       Unlike the case with privileges, membership in a role cannot be granted to PUBLIC. Note also that this
       form of the command does not allow the noise word GROUP in <u>role_specification</u>.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>REVOKE</b> command is used to revoke access privileges.

       Since PostgreSQL 8.1, the concepts of users and groups have been unified into a single kind of entity
       called a role. It is therefore no longer necessary to use the keyword GROUP to identify whether a grantee
       is a user or a group.  GROUP is still allowed in the command, but it is a noise word.

       A user may perform <b>SELECT</b>, <b>INSERT</b>, etc. on a column if they hold that privilege for either the specific
       column or its whole table. Granting the privilege at the table level and then revoking it for one column
       will not do what one might wish: the table-level grant is unaffected by a column-level operation.

       When a non-owner of an object attempts to <b>GRANT</b> privileges on the object, the command will fail outright
       if the user has no privileges whatsoever on the object. As long as some privilege is available, the
       command will proceed, but it will grant only those privileges for which the user has grant options. The
       <b>GRANT</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>PRIVILEGES</b> forms will issue a warning message if no grant options are held, while the other
       forms will issue a warning if grant options for any of the privileges specifically named in the command
       are not held. (In principle these statements apply to the object owner as well, but since the owner is
       always treated as holding all grant options, the cases can never occur.)

       It should be noted that database superusers can access all objects regardless of object privilege
       settings. This is comparable to the rights of root in a Unix system. As with root, it's unwise to operate
       as a superuser except when absolutely necessary.

       If a superuser chooses to issue a <b>GRANT</b> or <b>REVOKE</b> command, the command is performed as though it were
       issued by the owner of the affected object. In particular, privileges granted via such a command will
       appear to have been granted by the object owner. (For role membership, the membership appears to have
       been granted by the bootstrap superuser.)

       <b>GRANT</b> and <b>REVOKE</b> can also be done by a role that is not the owner of the affected object, but is a member
       of the role that owns the object, or is a member of a role that holds privileges WITH GRANT OPTION on the
       object. In this case the privileges will be recorded as having been granted by the role that actually
       owns the object or holds the privileges WITH GRANT OPTION. For example, if table t1 is owned by role g1,
       of which role u1 is a member, then u1 can grant privileges on t1 to u2, but those privileges will appear
       to have been granted directly by g1. Any other member of role g1 could revoke them later.

       If the role executing <b>GRANT</b> holds the required privileges indirectly via more than one role membership
       path, it is unspecified which containing role will be recorded as having done the grant. In such cases it
       is best practice to use <b>SET</b> <b>ROLE</b> to become the specific role you want to do the <b>GRANT</b> as.

       Granting permission on a table does not automatically extend permissions to any sequences used by the
       table, including sequences tied to SERIAL columns. Permissions on sequences must be set separately.

       See Section 5.8 for more information about specific privilege types, as well as how to inspect objects'
       privileges.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Grant insert privilege to all users on table films:

           GRANT INSERT ON films TO PUBLIC;

       Grant all available privileges to user manuel on view kinds:

           GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON kinds TO manuel;

       Note that while the above will indeed grant all privileges if executed by a superuser or the owner of
       kinds, when executed by someone else it will only grant those permissions for which the someone else has
       grant options.

       Grant membership in role admins to user joe:

           GRANT admins TO joe;

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       According to the SQL standard, the PRIVILEGES key word in ALL PRIVILEGES is required. The SQL standard
       does not support setting the privileges on more than one object per command.

       PostgreSQL allows an object owner to revoke their own ordinary privileges: for example, a table owner can
       make the table read-only to themselves by revoking their own INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and TRUNCATE
       privileges. This is not possible according to the SQL standard. The reason is that PostgreSQL treats the
       owner's privileges as having been granted by the owner to themselves; therefore they can revoke them too.
       In the SQL standard, the owner's privileges are granted by an assumed entity “_SYSTEM”. Not being
       “_SYSTEM”, the owner cannot revoke these rights.

       According to the SQL standard, grant options can be granted to PUBLIC; PostgreSQL only supports granting
       grant options to roles.

       The SQL standard allows the GRANTED BY option to specify only CURRENT_USER or CURRENT_ROLE. The other
       variants are PostgreSQL extensions.

       The SQL standard provides for a USAGE privilege on other kinds of objects: character sets, collations,
       translations.

       In the SQL standard, sequences only have a USAGE privilege, which controls the use of the NEXT VALUE FOR
       expression, which is equivalent to the function <b>nextval</b> in PostgreSQL. The sequence privileges SELECT and
       UPDATE are PostgreSQL extensions. The application of the sequence USAGE privilege to the currval function
       is also a PostgreSQL extension (as is the function itself).

       Privileges on databases, tablespaces, schemas, languages, and configuration parameters are PostgreSQL
       extensions.
