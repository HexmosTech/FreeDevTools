       CREATE_SCHEMA - define a new schema

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CREATE SCHEMA <u>schema_name</u> [ AUTHORIZATION <u>role_specification</u> ] [ <u>schema_element</u> [ ... ] ]
       CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION <u>role_specification</u> [ <u>schema_element</u> [ ... ] ]
       CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS <u>schema_name</u> [ AUTHORIZATION <u>role_specification</u> ]
       CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS AUTHORIZATION <u>role_specification</u>

       where <u>role_specification</u> can be:

           <u>user_name</u>
         | CURRENT_ROLE
         | CURRENT_USER
         | SESSION_USER

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>CREATE</b> <b>SCHEMA</b> enters a new schema into the current database. The schema name must be distinct from the
       name of any existing schema in the current database.

       A schema is essentially a namespace: it contains named objects (tables, data types, functions, and
       operators) whose names can duplicate those of other objects existing in other schemas. Named objects are
       accessed either by “qualifying” their names with the schema name as a prefix, or by setting a search path
       that includes the desired schema(s). A CREATE command specifying an unqualified object name creates the
       object in the current schema (the one at the front of the search path, which can be determined with the
       function <b>current_schema</b>).

       Optionally, <b>CREATE</b> <b>SCHEMA</b> can include subcommands to create objects within the new schema. The
       subcommands are treated essentially the same as separate commands issued after creating the schema,
       except that if the AUTHORIZATION clause is used, all the created objects will be owned by that user.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>schema_name</u>
           The name of a schema to be created. If this is omitted, the <u>user_name</u> is used as the schema name. The
           name cannot begin with pg_, as such names are reserved for system schemas.

       <u>user_name</u>
           The role name of the user who will own the new schema. If omitted, defaults to the user executing the
           command. To create a schema owned by another role, you must be able to SET ROLE to that role.

       <u>schema_element</u>
           An SQL statement defining an object to be created within the schema. Currently, only <b>CREATE</b> <b>TABLE</b>,
           <b>CREATE</b> <b>VIEW</b>, <b>CREATE</b> <b>INDEX</b>, <b>CREATE</b> <b>SEQUENCE</b>, <b>CREATE</b> <b>TRIGGER</b> and <b>GRANT</b> are accepted as clauses within
           <b>CREATE</b> <b>SCHEMA</b>. Other kinds of objects may be created in separate commands after the schema is
           created.

       IF NOT EXISTS
           Do nothing (except issuing a notice) if a schema with the same name already exists.  <u>schema_element</u>
           subcommands cannot be included when this option is used.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       To create a schema, the invoking user must have the CREATE privilege for the current database. (Of
       course, superusers bypass this check.)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Create a schema:

           CREATE SCHEMA myschema;

       Create a schema for user joe; the schema will also be named joe:

           CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION joe;

       Create a schema named test that will be owned by user joe, unless there already is a schema named test.
       (It does not matter whether joe owns the pre-existing schema.)

           CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS test AUTHORIZATION joe;

       Create a schema and create a table and view within it:

           CREATE SCHEMA hollywood
               CREATE TABLE films (title text, release date, awards text[])
               CREATE VIEW winners AS
                   SELECT title, release FROM films WHERE awards IS NOT NULL;

       Notice that the individual subcommands do not end with semicolons.

       The following is an equivalent way of accomplishing the same result:

           CREATE SCHEMA hollywood;
           CREATE TABLE hollywood.films (title text, release date, awards text[]);
           CREATE VIEW hollywood.winners AS
               SELECT title, release FROM hollywood.films WHERE awards IS NOT NULL;

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The SQL standard allows a DEFAULT CHARACTER SET clause in <b>CREATE</b> <b>SCHEMA</b>, as well as more subcommand types
       than are presently accepted by PostgreSQL.

       The SQL standard specifies that the subcommands in <b>CREATE</b> <b>SCHEMA</b> can appear in any order. The present
       PostgreSQL implementation does not handle all cases of forward references in subcommands; it might
       sometimes be necessary to reorder the subcommands in order to avoid forward references.

       According to the SQL standard, the owner of a schema always owns all objects within it.  PostgreSQL
       allows schemas to contain objects owned by users other than the schema owner. This can happen only if the
       schema owner grants the CREATE privilege on their schema to someone else, or a superuser chooses to
       create objects in it.

       The IF NOT EXISTS option is a PostgreSQL extension.
