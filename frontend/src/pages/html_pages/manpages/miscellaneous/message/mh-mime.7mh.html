</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mh-mime - overview of nmh MIME message composition and display

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  acronym  MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, the format of Internet messages used
       to send multi-media content.  The <b>nmh</b> command suite has support for the display and composition  of  MIME
       messages, but currently MIME support is not completely integrated into all tools.  This document provides
       an overview as to which tools support MIME message display, storage, and composition.

   <b>Local</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Set</b> <b>Conversion</b>
       All of the <b>nmh</b> commands convert non-native character sets to the local character set, as specified by the
       operating  system  locale  settings.  See <u><a href="../man1/locale.1.html">locale</a></u>(1) for more details on the environment variables used to
       set the local character set.  Character set conversion will  only  take  place  if  <b>nmh</b>  was  built  with
       <u><a href="../man3/iconv.3.html">iconv</a></u>(3)  support.   See  <u><a href="../man1/mhparam.1.html">mhparam</a></u>(1) for how to determine whether your <b>nmh</b> installation includes <u><a href="../man3/iconv.3.html">iconv</a></u>(3)
       support.

       Depending on the source and target character set, it may not be possible to convert all characters to the
       local character set.  In this case a substitution character will be used for the characters  that  cannot
       be converted.

   <b>Message</b> <b>Display</b>
       The  default format used by <u><a href="../man1/scan.1.html">scan</a></u>(1) will automatically decode MIME-encoded headers.  If you have a custom
       <b>scan</b> format, see the examples provided with the <b>nmh</b> distribution (found in the “<u>/etc/nmh</u>” directory)  and
       <u><a href="../man5/mh-format.5.html">mh-format</a></u>(5) for details on how to make sure your MIME headers are properly decoded.

       By  default,  if  <b>show</b>  detects  that it is reading a MIME message it will invoke <u><a href="../man1/mhshow.1.html">mhshow</a></u>(1).  The default
       behavior of <b>mhshow</b> is to only display text parts that are not marked as attachments.  See  <u><a href="../man1/mhshow.1.html">mhshow</a></u>(1)  for
       details on how to control what <b>mhshow</b> will display.

   <b>Message</b> <b>Interrogation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Storage</b>
       The  <u><a href="../man1/mhlist.1.html">mhlist</a></u>(1)  command  will  display  a  listing  of  the  MIME parts contained within a message.  That
       information can be used in conjunction with the <b>mhstore</b> command to save individual parts or content types
       of a message.  See <u><a href="../man1/mhlist.1.html">mhlist</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/mhstore.1.html">mhstore</a></u>(1) for more details on how these commands work.

   <b>Message</b> <b>Composition</b> <b>and</b> <b>Reply</b>
       All messages sent by <u><a href="../man1/send.1.html">send</a></u>(1) will automatically be processed by <u><a href="../man1/mhbuild.1.html">mhbuild</a></u>(1) before being passed to <u><a href="../man1/post.1.html">post</a></u>(1)
       for message submission.  <b>mhbuild</b> will use the locale settings to mark text content with  the  appropriate
       character  set  and  apply  any  necessary encoding.  If you wish to include text in your message using a
       character set that does not match your locale, you will need  to  specify  the  character  set  using  an
       <b>mhbuild</b> directive; see <u><a href="../man1/mhbuild.1.html">mhbuild</a></u>(1) for more information.

       For  attaching  files  or  composing other non-text content, there are two options: the attach system and
       <b>mhbuild</b> directives.

       The attach system is best suited for content where one or more files are being  attached  to  a  message.
       You  can  use  the  attach  system  by  either  using the <b>attach</b> command at the “What now?” prompt, or by
       inserting an “Attach:” header in the message draft containing the name of the file you wish to attach  to
       the  message  (note  that all the <b>attach</b> command does is place an “Attach:” header in the message draft).
       <b>mhbuild</b> will then automatically include the specified file(s) in the outgoing message.  See  <u><a href="../man1/send.1.html">send</a></u>(1)  for
       details on how <b>mhbuild</b> determines the proper content type of attached files.

       The other method of composing MIME messages is to use <b>mhbuild</b> directives.  This allows exact control over
       the  contents  and  format  of  the MIME message, but has a more complicated syntax.  <u><a href="../man1/mhbuild.1.html">mhbuild</a></u>(1) contains
       details on the directive syntax and examples of directives for different media types.  It is important to
       note that when using <b>mhbuild</b> directives the user must run <b>mhbuild</b> outside of  <b>send</b>  to  have  it  process
       directives;  when  being run by <b>send</b>, <b>mhbuild</b> is configured to not process directives so normal user text
       is not mistaken for a directive.  When using directives a user typically uses the  <b>mime</b>  command  at  the
       “What now?” prompt to process them.

       When  replying  to messages using <u><a href="../man1/repl.1.html">repl</a></u>(1) the traditional MH method of including the original text in the
       reply does not interoperate with  MIME  messages.   The  <b>-convertargs</b>  switch  to  <u><a href="../man1/repl.1.html">repl</a></u>(1)  provides  one
       solution.   Another solution:  the contrib directory (<u>/usr/share/doc/nmh/contrib</u>) contains a Perl program
       called <b>replyfilter</b> which will decode text parts and present them in an appropriate manner to be  included
       in  a message reply.  See the comments at the top of <b>replyfilter</b> for instructions on how to configure <b>nmh</b>
       to work with it.

   <b>Message</b> <b>Rewrite</b>
       The <u><a href="../man1/mhfixmsg.1.html">mhfixmsg</a></u>(1) command can apply various transformations to MIME messages, including  decoding  of  text
       parts,  converting  the  character  set of text parts, and insertion of text/plain parts to correspond to
       text parts of other subtypes.  <b>mhfixmsg</b> can also repair defects in MIME messages, such as mismatched top-
       level boundary indicators and invalid Content-Transfer-Encoding values.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       MIME support should be more integrated into all of the <b>nmh</b> tools than it currently is.
