       nng - nanomsg next generation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cc</b> ['flags'] 'files' <b>-lnng</b> ['libraries']

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>NNG</u> provides a common messaging framework intended to solve common communication problems in distributed
       applications. It offers a number of <u>protocols</u>, and also a number of <u>transports</u>.

       The <u>protocols</u> implement the semantics associated with particular communications scenarios, such as RPC
       style services, service discovery, publish/subscribe, and so forth.

       The <u>transports</u> provide support for underlying transport methods, such as TCP, IPC, websockets, and so
       forth.

       <u>NNG</u> is designed to permit easy creation of new <u>transports</u> and, to a lesser extent, new <u>protocols</u>.

       <u>NNG</u> is wire compatible with the SP protocols described in the nanomsg project; projects using <u>libnanomsg</u>
       &lt;https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg&gt; can inter-operate with nng as well as other conforming
       implementations. (One such implementation is <u>mangos</u> &lt;https://github.com/go-mangos/mangos&gt;.) Applications
       using <u>NNG</u> which wish to communicate with other libraries must ensure that they only use protocols or
       transports offered by the other library.

       <u>NNG</u> also offers a compatible API, permitting legacy code to be recompiled or relinked against <u>NNG</u>. When
       doing this, support for certain enhancements or features will likely be absent, requiring the application
       developer to use the new-style API.

       <u>NNG</u> is implemented in pure C; if you need bindings for other languages please check the website
       &lt;<a href="http://nanomsg.org/">http://nanomsg.org/</a>&gt;.

   <b>Conceptual</b> <b>Overview</b>
       <u>NNG</u> presents a <u>socket</u> view of networking. The sockets are constructed using protocol-specific functions,
       as a given socket implements precisely one protocol.

       Each socket can be used to send and receive messages (if the protocol) supports it, and implements the
       appropriate protocol semantics. For example, <u>sub</u> sockets automatically filter incoming messages to
       discard those for topics that have not been subscribed.

       <u>NNG</u> sockets are message oriented, so that messages are either delivered wholly, or not at all. Partial
       delivery is not possible. Furthermore, <u>NNG</u> does not provide any other delivery or ordering guarantees;
       messages may be dropped or reordered (Some protocols, such as <u>req</u> may offer stronger guarantees by
       performing their own retry and validation schemes.)

       Each socket can have zero, one, or many endpoints, which are either <u>listeners</u> or <u>dialers</u>. (A given socket
       may freely choose whether it uses listeners, dialers, or both.) These endpoints provide access to
       underlying transports, such as TCP, etc.

       Each endpoint is associated with a URL, which is a service address. For dialers, this will be the service
       address that will be contacted, whereas for listeners this is where the listener will accept new
       connections.

       Endpoints do not themselves transport data. They are instead responsible for the creation of <u>pipes</u>, which
       can be thought of as message-oriented connected streams. Pipes frequently correspond to a single
       underlying byte stream. For example both IPC and TCP transports implement their pipes using a 1:1
       relationship with a connected operating system socket.

       Endpoints create pipes as needed. Listeners will create them when a new client connection request
       arrives, and dialers will generally create one, then wait for it to disconnect before reconnecting.

       Most applications should not have to worry about endpoints or pipes at all; the socket abstraction should
       provide all the functionality needed other than in a few specific circumstances.

   <b>Raw</b> <b>Mode</b>
       Most applications will use sockets in normal, or <u>cooked</u>, mode. This mode provides the full semantics of
       the protocol. For example, <u>req</u> sockets will automatically match a reply to a request, and resend requests
       periodically if no reply was received.

       There are situations, such as with proxies, where it is desirable to bypass these semantics and simply
       pass messages to and from the socket with no extra semantic handling. This is possible using <u>raw</u> mode
       sockets.

       Raw mode sockets are generally constructed with a different function, such as nng_req0_open_raw(). Using
       these sockets, the application can simply send and receive messages, and is responsible for supplying any
       additional socket semantics. Typically this means that the application will need to inspect message
       headers on incoming messages, and supply them on outgoing messages.

           <b>Tip</b>

           The nng_device() function only works with raw mode sockets, but as it only forwards the messages, no
           additional application processing is needed.

   <b>URLs</b>
       <u>NNG</u> uses universal resource locators (URLs) following the format specified in RFC 3986
       &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986&gt;, including some schemes that are unique to SP.

       The URLs used in <u>NNG</u> are canonicalized as follows, mostly in accordance with RFC 3986 6.2.2
       &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6.2.2&gt;:

        1. The URL is parsed into scheme, userinfo, host, port, path, query and fragment components. (Not all of
           these members are necessarily present.)

        2. The scheme, hostname, and port if present, are converted to lower case.

        3. Percent-encoded values for unreserved characters &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.3&gt;
           converted to their unencoded forms.

        4. Additionally URL percent-encoded values for characters in the path and with numeric values larger
           than 127 (i.e. not ASCII) are decoded.

        5. The resulting path is checked for invalid UTF-8 sequences, consisting of surrogate pairs, illegal
           byte sequences, or overlong encodings. If this check fails, then the entire URL is considered
           invalid.

        6. Path segments consisting of . and .. are resolved as per RFC 3986 6.2.2.3
           &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6.2.2.3&gt;.

        7. Further, empty path segments are removed, meaning that duplicate slash (/) separators are removed
           from the path.

       Note that steps 4, 5, and 7 are not specified by RFC 3986, but performing them is believed to improve
       both the usability and security of applications, without violating RFC 3986 itself.

           <b>Tip</b>

           Port numbers may be service names in some instances, but it is recommended that numeric port numbers
           be used when known. If service names are used, it is recommended that they follow the naming
           conventions for C identifiers, and not be longer than 32 characters in length. This will maximize
           compatibility across systems and minimize opportunities for confusion when they are parsed on
           different systems.
