       boot - System bootup process based on UNIX System V Release 4

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>bootup</b> <b>process</b> (or "<b>boot</b> <b>sequence</b>") varies in details among systems, but can be roughly divided into
       phases controlled by the following components:

       (1)  hardware

       (2)  operating system (OS) loader

       (3)  kernel

       (4)  root user-space process (<u>init</u> and <u>inittab</u>)

       (5)  boot scripts

       Each of these is described below in more detail.

   <b>Hardware</b>
       After power-on or hard reset, control is given to a program stored in read-only memory  (normally  PROM);
       for historical reasons involving the personal computer, this program is often called "the <b>BIOS</b>".

       This  program  normally performs a basic self-test of the machine and accesses nonvolatile memory to read
       further parameters.  This memory in the PC is battery-backed CMOS memory, so most people refer to  it  as
       "the <b>CMOS</b>"; outside of the PC world, it is usually called "the <b>NVRAM</b>" (nonvolatile RAM).

       The parameters stored in the NVRAM vary among systems, but as a minimum, they should specify which device
       can  supply an OS loader, or at least which devices may be probed for one; such a device is known as "the
       <b>boot</b> <b>device</b>".  The hardware boot stage loads the OS loader from a fixed position on the boot device,  and
       then transfers control to it.

       Note:  The  device  from  which  the  OS  loader is read may be attached via a network, in which case the
              details of booting are further specified by protocols such as DHCP, TFTP, PXE, Etherboot, etc.

   <b>OS</b> <b>loader</b>
       The main job of the OS loader is to locate the kernel on some device, load  it,  and  run  it.   Most  OS
       loaders  allow interactive use, in order to enable specification of an alternative kernel (maybe a backup
       in case the one last compiled isn't functioning) and to pass optional parameters to the kernel.

       In a traditional PC, the OS loader is located in the initial 512-byte block  of  the  boot  device;  this
       block is known as "the <b>MBR</b>" (Master Boot Record).

       In most systems, the OS loader is very limited due to various constraints.  Even on non-PC systems, there
       are  some  limitations  on  the size and complexity of this loader, but the size limitation of the PC MBR
       (512 bytes, including the partition table) makes it almost impossible to squeeze much functionality  into
       it.

       Therefore,  most  systems split the role of loading the OS between a primary OS loader and a secondary OS
       loader; this secondary OS loader may be located within a larger portion of persistent storage, such as  a
       disk partition.

       In Linux, the OS loader is often <b><a href="../man8/grub.8.html">grub</a></b>(8) (an alternative is <b><a href="../man8/lilo.8.html">lilo</a></b>(8)).

   <b>Kernel</b>
       When  the  kernel is loaded, it initializes various components of the computer and operating system; each
       portion of software responsible for such a task  is  usually  consider  "a  <b>driver</b>"  for  the  applicable
       component.   The  kernel  starts the virtual memory swapper (it is a kernel process, called "kswapd" in a
       modern Linux kernel), and mounts some filesystem at the root path, <u>/</u>.

       Some of the parameters that may be passed to the kernel relate to  these  activities  (for  example,  the
       default  root  filesystem  can  be  overridden); for further information on Linux kernel parameters, read
       <b><a href="../man7/bootparam.7.html">bootparam</a></b>(7).

       Only then does the kernel create the initial userland process, which is given the number  1  as  its  <b>PID</b>
       (process  ID).   Traditionally,  this  process  executes  the program <u><a href="file:/sbin/init">/sbin/init</a></u>, to which are passed the
       parameters that haven't already been handled by the kernel.

   <b>Root</b> <b>user-space</b> <b>process</b>
       Note:  The following description applies to an OS based on UNIX System V Release 4.  However, a number of
              widely used systems  have  adopted  a  related  but  fundamentally  different  approach  known  as
              <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1), for which the bootup process is detailed in its associated <b><a href="../man7/bootup.7.html">bootup</a></b>(7).

       When <u><a href="file:/sbin/init">/sbin/init</a></u> starts, it reads <u>/etc/inittab</u> for further instructions.  This file defines what should be
       run  when  the <u><a href="file:/sbin/init">/sbin/init</a></u> program is instructed to enter a particular run level, giving the administrator
       an easy way to establish an environment for some usage; each run  level  is  associated  with  a  set  of
       services  (for  example,  run  level  <b>S</b> is single-user mode, and run level <b>2</b> entails running most network
       services).

       The administrator may change the current run level via <b><a href="../man1/init.1.html">init</a></b>(1), and  query  the  current  run  level  via
       <b><a href="../man8/runlevel.8.html">runlevel</a></b>(8).

       However, since it is not convenient to manage individual services by editing this file, <u>/etc/inittab</u> only
       bootstraps a set of scripts that actually start/stop the individual services.

   <b>Boot</b> <b>scripts</b>
       Note:  The following description applies to an OS based on UNIX System V Release 4.  However, a number of
              widely  used systems (Slackware Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD) have a somewhat different scheme for boot
              scripts.

       For each managed service (mail, nfs server, cron, etc.), there is a single startup script  located  in  a
       specific  directory  (<u><a href="file:/etc/init.d">/etc/init.d</a></u>  in most versions of Linux).  Each of these scripts accepts as a single
       argument the word "start" (causing it to start the service) or the word "stop" (causing it  to  stop  the
       service).   The  script may optionally accept other "convenience" parameters (e.g., "restart" to stop and
       then start, "status" to display the  service  status,  etc.).   Running  the  script  without  parameters
       displays the possible arguments.

   <b>Sequencing</b> <b>directories</b>
       To  make specific scripts start/stop at specific run levels and in a specific order, there are <u>sequencing</u>
       <u>directories</u>, normally of the form  <u>/etc/rc[0-6S].d</u>.  In  each  of  these  directories,  there  are  links
       (usually symbolic) to the scripts in the <u><a href="file:/etc/init.d">/etc/init.d</a></u> directory.

       A  primary  script  (usually <u>/etc/rc</u>) is called from <b><a href="../man5/inittab.5.html">inittab</a></b>(5); this primary script calls each service's
       script via a link in the relevant sequencing directory.  Each link whose name begins with 'S'  is  called
       with the argument "start" (thereby starting the service).  Each link whose name begins with 'K' is called
       with the argument "stop" (thereby stopping the service).

       To define the starting or stopping order within the same run level, the name of a link contains an <b>order-</b>
       <b>number</b>.   Also,  for  clarity,  the  name of a link usually ends with the name of the service to which it
       refers.  For example, the link <u>/etc/rc2.d/S80sendmail</u> starts the <b><a href="../man8/sendmail.8.html">sendmail</a></b>(8)  service  on  run  level  2.
       This happens after <u>/etc/rc2.d/S12syslog</u> is run but before <u>/etc/rc2.d/S90xfs</u> is run.

       To  manage these links is to manage the boot order and run levels; under many systems, there are tools to
       help with this task (e.g., <b><a href="../man8/chkconfig.8.html">chkconfig</a></b>(8)).

   <b>Boot</b> <b>configuration</b>
       A program that provides a service is often called a "<b>daemon</b>".  Usually,  a  daemon  may  receive  various
       command-line  options  and  parameters.   To  allow a system administrator to change these inputs without
       editing an entire boot script, some separate configuration file is used, and is  located  in  a  specific
       directory where an associated boot script may find it (<u>/etc/sysconfig</u> on older Red Hat systems).

       In  older UNIX systems, such a file contained the actual command line options for a daemon, but in modern
       Linux systems (and also in HP-UX), it just contains shell variables.  A boot script in <u><a href="file:/etc/init.d">/etc/init.d</a></u>  reads
       and  includes  its  configuration  file  (that is, it "<b>sources</b>" its configuration file) and then uses the
       variable values.
