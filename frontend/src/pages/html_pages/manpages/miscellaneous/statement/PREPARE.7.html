</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PREPARE - prepare a statement for execution

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       PREPARE <u>name</u> [ ( <u>data_type</u> [, ...] ) ] AS <u>statement</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>PREPARE</b> creates a prepared statement. A prepared statement is a server-side object that can be used to
       optimize performance. When the <b>PREPARE</b> statement is executed, the specified statement is parsed,
       analyzed, and rewritten. When an <b>EXECUTE</b> command is subsequently issued, the prepared statement is
       planned and executed. This division of labor avoids repetitive parse analysis work, while allowing the
       execution plan to depend on the specific parameter values supplied.

       Prepared statements can take parameters: values that are substituted into the statement when it is
       executed. When creating the prepared statement, refer to parameters by position, using $1, $2, etc. A
       corresponding list of parameter data types can optionally be specified. When a parameter's data type is
       not specified or is declared as unknown, the type is inferred from the context in which the parameter is
       first referenced (if possible). When executing the statement, specify the actual values for these
       parameters in the <b>EXECUTE</b> statement. Refer to <b><a href="../man7/EXECUTE.7.html">EXECUTE</a></b>(7) for more information about that.

       Prepared statements only last for the duration of the current database session. When the session ends,
       the prepared statement is forgotten, so it must be recreated before being used again. This also means
       that a single prepared statement cannot be used by multiple simultaneous database clients; however, each
       client can create their own prepared statement to use. Prepared statements can be manually cleaned up
       using the <b>DEALLOCATE</b> command.

       Prepared statements potentially have the largest performance advantage when a single session is being
       used to execute a large number of similar statements. The performance difference will be particularly
       significant if the statements are complex to plan or rewrite, e.g., if the query involves a join of many
       tables or requires the application of several rules. If the statement is relatively simple to plan and
       rewrite but relatively expensive to execute, the performance advantage of prepared statements will be
       less noticeable.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>name</u>
           An arbitrary name given to this particular prepared statement. It must be unique within a single
           session and is subsequently used to execute or deallocate a previously prepared statement.

       <u>data_type</u>
           The data type of a parameter to the prepared statement. If the data type of a particular parameter is
           unspecified or is specified as unknown, it will be inferred from the context in which the parameter
           is first referenced. To refer to the parameters in the prepared statement itself, use $1, $2, etc.

       <u>statement</u>
           Any <b>SELECT</b>, <b>INSERT</b>, <b>UPDATE</b>, <b>DELETE</b>, <b>MERGE</b>, or <b>VALUES</b> statement.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       A prepared statement can be executed with either a generic plan or a custom plan. A generic plan is the
       same across all executions, while a custom plan is generated for a specific execution using the parameter
       values given in that call. Use of a generic plan avoids planning overhead, but in some situations a
       custom plan will be much more efficient to execute because the planner can make use of knowledge of the
       parameter values. (Of course, if the prepared statement has no parameters, then this is moot and a
       generic plan is always used.)

       By default (that is, when plan_cache_mode is set to auto), the server will automatically choose whether
       to use a generic or custom plan for a prepared statement that has parameters. The current rule for this
       is that the first five executions are done with custom plans and the average estimated cost of those
       plans is calculated. Then a generic plan is created and its estimated cost is compared to the average
       custom-plan cost. Subsequent executions use the generic plan if its cost is not so much higher than the
       average custom-plan cost as to make repeated replanning seem preferable.

       This heuristic can be overridden, forcing the server to use either generic or custom plans, by setting
       <u>plan_cache_mode</u> to force_generic_plan or force_custom_plan respectively. This setting is primarily useful
       if the generic plan's cost estimate is badly off for some reason, allowing it to be chosen even though
       its actual cost is much more than that of a custom plan.

       To examine the query plan PostgreSQL is using for a prepared statement, use <b>EXPLAIN</b>, for example

           EXPLAIN EXECUTE <u>name</u>(<u>parameter_values</u>);

       If a generic plan is in use, it will contain parameter symbols $<u>n</u>, while a custom plan will have the
       supplied parameter values substituted into it.

       For more information on query planning and the statistics collected by PostgreSQL for that purpose, see
       the <b><a href="../man7/ANALYZE.7.html">ANALYZE</a></b>(7) documentation.

       Although the main point of a prepared statement is to avoid repeated parse analysis and planning of the
       statement, PostgreSQL will force re-analysis and re-planning of the statement before using it whenever
       database objects used in the statement have undergone definitional (DDL) changes or their planner
       statistics have been updated since the previous use of the prepared statement. Also, if the value of
       search_path changes from one use to the next, the statement will be re-parsed using the new <u>search_path</u>.
       (This latter behavior is new as of PostgreSQL 9.3.) These rules make use of a prepared statement
       semantically almost equivalent to re-submitting the same query text over and over, but with a performance
       benefit if no object definitions are changed, especially if the best plan remains the same across uses.
       An example of a case where the semantic equivalence is not perfect is that if the statement refers to a
       table by an unqualified name, and then a new table of the same name is created in a schema appearing
       earlier in the <u>search_path</u>, no automatic re-parse will occur since no object used in the statement
       changed. However, if some other change forces a re-parse, the new table will be referenced in subsequent
       uses.

       You can see all prepared statements available in the session by querying the pg_prepared_statements
       system view.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Create a prepared statement for an <b>INSERT</b> statement, and then execute it:

           PREPARE fooplan (int, text, bool, numeric) AS
               INSERT INTO foo VALUES($1, $2, $3, $4);
           EXECUTE fooplan(1, 'Hunter Valley', 't', 200.00);

       Create a prepared statement for a <b>SELECT</b> statement, and then execute it:

           PREPARE usrrptplan (int) AS
               SELECT * FROM users u, logs l WHERE u.usrid=$1 AND u.usrid=l.usrid
               AND l.date = $2;
           EXECUTE usrrptplan(1, current_date);

       In this example, the data type of the second parameter is not specified, so it is inferred from the
       context in which $2 is used.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The SQL standard includes a <b>PREPARE</b> statement, but it is only for use in embedded SQL. This version of
       the <b>PREPARE</b> statement also uses a somewhat different syntax.
