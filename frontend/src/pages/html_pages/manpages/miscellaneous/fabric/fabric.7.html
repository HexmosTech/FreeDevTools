</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fabric - Fabric Interface Library

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
              #include &lt;rdma/fabric.h&gt;

       Libfabric  is  a  high-performance  fabric software library designed to provide low-latency interfaces to
       fabric hardware.  For an in-depth discussion of the motivation and design see <b><a href="../man7/fi_guide.7.html">fi_guide</a></b>(7).

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       Libfabric provides `process direct I/O' to application software communicating across fabric software  and
       hardware.  Process direct I/O, historically referred to as RDMA, allows an application to directly access
       network  resources without operating system interventions.  Data transfers can occur directly to and from
       application memory.

       There are two components to the libfabric software:

       <u>Fabric</u> <u>Providers</u>
              Conceptually, a fabric provider may be viewed as a local hardware NIC driver, though a provider is
              not limited by this definition.  The first component of libfabric is a general  purpose  framework
              that  is  capable of handling different types of fabric hardware.  All fabric hardware devices and
              their software drivers are required to support this framework.  Devices and the drivers that  plug
              into  the  libfabric framework are referred to as fabric providers, or simply providers.  Provider
              details may be found in <b><a href="../man7/fi_provider.7.html">fi_provider</a></b>(7).

       <u>Fabric</u> <u>Interfaces</u>
              The second component is a set of communication operations.  Libfabric defines several sets of com‐
              munication functions that providers can support.  It is not required that providers implement  all
              the interfaces that are defined; however, providers clearly indicate which interfaces they do sup‐
              port.

</pre><h4><b>FABRIC</b> <b>INTERFACES</b></h4><pre>
       The  fabric interfaces are designed such that they are cohesive and not simply a union of disjoint inter‐
       faces.  The interfaces are logically divided into two groups: control interfaces and communication opera‐
       tions.  The control interfaces are a common set of operations that provide access to local  communication
       resources, such as address vectors and event queues.  The communication operations expose particular mod‐
       els  of  communication and fabric functionality, such as message queues, remote memory access, and atomic
       operations.  Communication operations are associated with fabric endpoints.

       Applications will typically use the control interfaces to discover local capabilities and allocate neces‐
       sary resources.  They will then allocate and configure a communication endpoint to send and receive data,
       or perform other types of data transfers, with remote endpoints.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROL</b> <b>INTERFACES</b></h4><pre>
       The control interfaces APIs provide applications access to network resources.  This involves listing  all
       the interfaces available, obtaining the capabilities of the interfaces and opening a provider.

       <u>fi_getinfo</u> <u>-</u> <u>Fabric</u> <u>Information</u>
              The  fi_getinfo  call is the base call used to discover and request fabric services offered by the
              system.  Applications can use this call to indicate the type of communication  that  they  desire.
              The results from fi_getinfo, fi_info, are used to reserve and configure fabric resources.

       fi_getinfo returns a list of fi_info structures.  Each structure references a single fabric provider, in‐
       dicating  the  interfaces  that  the  provider  supports,  along with a named set of resources.  A fabric
       provider may include multiple fi_info structures in the returned list.

       <u>fi_fabric</u> <u>-</u> <u>Fabric</u> <u>Domain</u>
              A fabric domain represents a collection of hardware and software resources that  access  a  single
              physical  or  virtual network.  All network ports on a system that can communicate with each other
              through the fabric belong to the same fabric domain.  A fabric domain shares network addresses and
              can span multiple providers.  libfabric supports systems connected to multiple fabrics.

       <u>fi_domain</u> <u>-</u> <u>Access</u> <u>Domains</u>
              An access domain represents a single logical connection into a fabric.  It may  map  to  a  single
              physical  or virtual NIC or a port.  An access domain defines the boundary across which fabric re‐
              sources may be associated.  Each access domain belongs to a single fabric domain.

       <u>fi_endpoint</u> <u>-</u> <u>Fabric</u> <u>Endpoint</u>
              A fabric endpoint is a communication portal.  An endpoint may be either active or  passive.   Pas‐
              sive  endpoints  are  used  to  listen for connection requests.  Active endpoints can perform data
              transfers.  Endpoints are configured with specific communication capabilities  and  data  transfer
              interfaces.

       <u>fi_eq</u> <u>-</u> <u>Event</u> <u>Queue</u>
              Event queues, are used to collect and report the completion of asynchronous operations and events.
              Event queues report events that are not directly associated with data transfer operations.

       <u>fi_cq</u> <u>-</u> <u>Completion</u> <u>Queue</u>
              Completion queues are high-performance event queues used to report the completion of data transfer
              operations.

       <u>fi_cntr</u> <u>-</u> <u>Event</u> <u>Counters</u>
              Event counters are used to report the number of completed asynchronous operations.  Event counters
              are considered light-weight, in that a completion simply increments a counter, rather than placing
              an entry into an event queue.

       <u>fi_mr</u> <u>-</u> <u>Memory</u> <u>Region</u>
              Memory regions describe application local memory buffers.  In order for fabric resources to access
              application  memory,  the  application  must first grant permission to the fabric provider by con‐
              structing a memory region.  Memory regions are required for specific types of data transfer opera‐
              tions, such as RMA transfers (see below).

       <u>fi_av</u> <u>-</u> <u>Address</u> <u>Vector</u>
              Address vectors are used to map higher level addresses, such as IP addresses, which  may  be  more
              natural for an application to use, into fabric specific addresses.  The use of address vectors al‐
              lows  providers  to reduce the amount of memory required to maintain large address look-up tables,
              and eliminate expensive address resolution and look-up methods during data transfer operations.

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>TRANSFER</b> <b>INTERFACES</b></h4><pre>
       Fabric endpoints are associated with multiple data transfer interfaces.  Each interface set  is  designed
       to  support  a  specific style of communication, with an endpoint allowing the different interfaces to be
       used in conjunction.  The following data transfer interfaces are defined by libfabric.

       <u>fi_msg</u> <u>-</u> <u>Message</u> <u>Queue</u>
              Message queues expose a simple, message-based FIFO queue interface to  the  application.   Message
              data  transfers  allow  applications  to send and receive data with message boundaries being main‐
              tained.

       <u>fi_tagged</u> <u>-</u> <u>Tagged</u> <u>Message</u> <u>Queues</u>
              Tagged message lists expose send/receive data transfer operations built on the concept  of  tagged
              messaging.   The tagged message queue is conceptually similar to standard message queues, but with
              the addition of 64-bit tags for each message.  Sent messages are matched with receive buffers that
              are tagged with a similar value.

       <u>fi_rma</u> <u>-</u> <u>Remote</u> <u>Memory</u> <u>Access</u>
              RMA transfers are one-sided operations that read or write data directly to a remote memory region.
              Other than defining the appropriate memory region, RMA operations do not  require  interaction  at
              the target side for the data transfer to complete.

       <u>fi_atomic</u> <u>-</u> <u>Atomic</u>
              Atomic  operations can perform one of several operations on a remote memory region.  Atomic opera‐
              tions include well-known functionality, such as atomic-add and compare-and-swap, plus several oth‐
              er pre-defined calls.  Unlike other data transfer interfaces, atomic operations are aware  of  the
              data formatting at the target memory region.

</pre><h4><b>LOGGING</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       Logging can be controlled using the FI_LOG_LEVEL, FI_LOG_PROV, and FI_LOG_SUBSYS environment variables.

       <u>FI_LOG_LEVEL</u>
              FI_LOG_LEVEL controls the amount of logging data that is output.  The following log levels are de‐
              fined.

       - <u>Warn</u> Warn is the least verbose setting and is intended for reporting errors or warnings.

       - <u>Trace</u>
              Trace  is more verbose and is meant to include non-detailed output helpful to tracing program exe‐
              cution.

       - <u>Info</u> Info is high traffic and meant for detailed output.

       - <u>Debug</u>
              Debug is high traffic and is likely to impact  application  performance.   Debug  output  is  only
              available if the library has been compiled with debugging enabled.

       <u>FI_LOG_PROV</u>
              The  FI_LOG_PROV  environment  variable  enables  or  disables  logging  from  specific providers.
              Providers can be enabled by listing them in a comma separated fashion.  If the  list  begins  with
              the `^' symbol, then the list will be negated.  By default all providers are enabled.

       Example: To enable logging from the psm3 and sockets provider: FI_LOG_PROV=“psm3,sockets”

       Example: To enable logging from providers other than psm3: FI_LOG_PROV=“^psm3”

       <u>FI_LOG_SUBSYS</u>
              The  FI_LOG_SUBSYS  environment  variable enables or disables logging at the subsystem level.  The
              syntax for enabling or disabling subsystems is similar to that used for FI_LOG_PROV.  The  follow‐
              ing subsystems are defined.

       - <u>core</u> Provides output related to the core framework and its management of providers.

       - <u>fabric</u>
              Provides output specific to interactions associated with the fabric object.

       - <u>domain</u>
              Provides output specific to interactions associated with the domain object.

       - <u>ep_ctrl</u>
              Provides output specific to endpoint non-data transfer operations, such as CM operations.

       - <u>ep_data</u>
              Provides output specific to endpoint data transfer operations.

       - <u>av</u>   Provides output specific to address vector operations.

       - <u>cq</u>   Provides output specific to completion queue operations.

       - <u>eq</u>   Provides output specific to event queue operations.

       - <u>mr</u>   Provides output specific to memory registration.

</pre><h4><b>PROVIDER</b> <b>INSTALLATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SELECTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  libfabric  build  scripts  will install all providers that are supported by the installation system.
       Providers that are missing build prerequisites will be disabled.  Installed  providers  will  dynamically
       check for necessary hardware on library initialization and respond appropriately to application queries.

       Users  can  enable  or  disable  available providers through build configuration options.  See `configure
       –help' for details.  In general, a specific provider can be controlled using the configure  option  `–en‐
       able-'.   For  example,  `–enable-udp' (or `–enable-udp=yes') will add the udp provider to the build.  To
       disable the provider, `–enable-udp=no' can be used.  To build the provider as a  stand-alone  dynamically
       loadable library (i.e. DL provider), `–enable-udp=dl' can be used.

       Providers  can  also  be  enable or disabled at run time using the FI_PROVIDER environment variable.  The
       FI_PROVIDER variable is set to a comma separated list of providers to include.  If the list  begins  with
       the `^' symbol, then the list will be negated.

       Example: To enable the udp and tcp providers only, set: <b>FI_PROVIDER="udp,tcp"</b>

       When libfabric is installed, DL providers are put under the <u>default</u> <u>provider</u> <u>path</u>, which is determined by
       how  libfabric  is  built  and  installed.   Usually  the  default  provider  path is <b>&lt;libfabric-install-</b>
       <b>dir&gt;/lib/libfabric</b> or <b>&lt;libfabric-install-dir&gt;/lib64/libfabric</b>.  By default, libfabric tries  to  find  DL
       providers in the following order:

       1. Use  `dlopen' to load provider libraries named <b>lib&lt;prov_name&gt;-fi.so</b> for all providers enabled at build
          time.  The search path of `ld.so' is used to locate the files.  This step is skipped if  libfabric  is
          configured with the option `–enable-restricted-dl'.

       2. Try to load every file under the default provider path as a DL provider.

       The  FI_PROVIDER_PATH  variable  can be used to change the location to search for DL providers and how to
       resolve conflicts if multiple providers with the same name are found.  Setting  FI_PROVIDER_PATH  to  any
       value, even if empty, would cause step 1 be skipped, and may change the search directory used in step 2.

       In  the  simplest  form,  the  FI_PROVIDER_PATH variable is set to a colon separated list of directories.
       These directories replace the default provider path used in step 2.  For example:

              FI_PROVIDER_PATH=/opt/libfabric:/opt/libfabric2

       By default, if multiple providers (including the built-in providers) with the same name  are  found,  the
       first  one with the highest version is active and all the others are hidden.  This can be changed by set‐
       ting the FI_PROVIDER_PATH variable to start with `@', which force the first one to be  active  regardless
       of the version.  For example:

              FI_PROVIDER_PATH=@/opt/libfabric:/opt/libfabric2

       The  FI_PROVIDER_PATH  variable can also specify preferred providers by supplying full paths to libraries
       instead of directories to search under.  A preferred provider takes precedence over other providers  with
       the same name.  The specification of a preferred provider must be prefixed with `+'.  For example:

              FI_PROVIDER_PATH=+/opt/libfabric2/libtcp-fi.so:/opt/libfabric:+/opt/libfabric2/libudp-fi.so

       If  FI_PROVIDER_PATH is set, but no directory is supplied, the default provider path is used.  Some exam‐
       ples:

              FI_PROVIDER_PATH=
              FI_PROVIDER_PATH=@
              FI_PROVIDER_PATH=+/opt/libfabric/libtcp-fi.so
              FI_PROVIDER_PATH=@+/opt/libfabric/libtcp-fi.so

       The fi_info utility, which is included as part of the libfabric package, can be used to retrieve informa‐
       tion about which providers are available in the system.  Additionally, it can retrieve a list of all  en‐
       vironment  variables  that may be used to configure libfabric and each provider.  See <b><a href="../man1/fi_info.1.html">fi_info</a></b>(1) for more
       details.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLE</b> <b>CONTROLS</b></h4><pre>
       Core features of libfabric and its providers may be configured by an administrator through the use of en‐
       vironment variables.  Man pages will usually describe the most commonly accessed variables, such as those
       mentioned above.  However, libfabric defines interfaces for publishing and  obtaining  environment  vari‐
       ables.   These  are  targeted  for providers, but allow applications and users to obtain the full list of
       variables that may be set, along with a brief description of their use.

       A full list of variables available may be obtained by running the fi_info application,  with  the  -e  or
       –env command line option.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>System</b> <b>Calls</b>
       Because  libfabric is designed to provide applications direct access to fabric hardware, there are limits
       on how libfabric resources may be used in conjunction with system calls.  These limitations  are  notable
       for  developers  who  may be familiar programming to the sockets interface.  Although limits are provider
       specific, the following restrictions apply to many providers and should be adhered to by applications de‐
       siring portability across providers.

       <u>fork</u>   Fabric resources are not guaranteed to be available by child processes.   This  includes  objects,
              such as endpoints and completion queues, as well as application controlled data buffers which have
              been  assigned  to the network.  For example, data buffers that have been registered with a fabric
              domain may not be available in a child process because of copy on write restrictions.

   <b>CUDA</b> <b>deadlock</b>
       In some cases, calls to <b>cudaMemcpy()</b> within libfabric may result in a deadlock.   This  typically  occurs
       when  a  CUDA  kernel blocks until a <b>cudaMemcpy</b> on the host completes.  Applications which can cause such
       behavior can restrict Libfabric’s ability  to  invoke  CUDA  API  operations  with  the  endpoint  option
       <b>FI_OPT_CUDA_API_PERMITTED</b>.  See <b><a href="../man3/fi_endpoint.3.html">fi_endpoint</a></b>(3) for more details.

       Another mechanism which can be used to avoid deadlock is Nvidia’s GDRCopy.  Using GDRCopy requires an ex‐
       ternal  library and kernel module available at https://github.com/NVIDIA/gdrcopy.  Libfabric must be con‐
       figured with GDRCopy support using the <b>--with-gdrcopy</b> option, and be run with <b>FI_HMEM_CUDA_USE_GDRCOPY=1</b>.
       This may not be supported by all providers.

</pre><h4><b>ABI</b> <b>CHANGES</b></h4><pre>
       libfabric releases maintain compatibility with older releases, so that compiled applications can continue
       to work as-is, and previously written applications will compile against newer  versions  of  the  library
       without needing source code changes.  The changes below describe ABI updates that have occurred and which
       libfabric release corresponds to the changes.

       Note  that  because most functions called by applications actually call static inline functions, which in
       turn reference function pointers in order to call directly into providers, libfabric only exports a hand‐
       ful of functions directly.  ABI changes are limited to those functions, most notably the fi_getinfo  call
       and its returned attribute structures.

       The ABI version is independent from the libfabric release version.

   <b>ABI</b> <b>1.0</b>
       The initial libfabric release (1.0.0) also corresponds to ABI version 1.0.  The 1.0 ABI was unchanged for
       libfabric major.minor versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4.

   <b>ABI</b> <b>1.1</b>
       A  number  of  external data structures were appended starting with libfabric version 1.5.  These changes
       included adding the fields to the following data structures.  The 1.1 ABI was exported by libfabric  ver‐
       sions 1.5 and 1.6.

       <u>fi_fabric_attr</u>
              Added api_version

       <u>fi_domain_attr</u>
              Added  cntr_cnt,  mr_iov_limit,  caps,  mode,  auth_key,  auth_key_size,  max_err_data, and mr_cnt
              fields.  The mr_mode field was also changed from an enum to an integer flag field.

       <u>fi_ep_attr</u>
              Added auth_key_size and auth_key fields.

   <b>ABI</b> <b>1.2</b>
       The 1.2 ABI version was exported by libfabric versions 1.7 and 1.8, and expanded the following structure.

       <u>fi_info</u>
              The fi_info structure was expanded to reference a new fabric object, fid_nic.  When available, the
              fid_nic references a new set of attributes related to network hardware details.

   <b>ABI</b> <b>1.3</b>
       The 1.3 ABI version was exported by libfabric versions 1.9, 1.10, and 1.11.  Added new fields to the fol‐
       lowing attributes:

       <u>fi_domain_attr</u>
              Added tclass

       <u>fi_tx_attr</u>
              Added tclass

   <b>ABI</b> <b>1.4</b>
       The 1.4 ABI version was exported by libfabric 1.12.  Added fi_tostr_r, a thread-safe (re-entrant) version
       of fi_tostr.

   <b>ABI</b> <b>1.5</b>
       ABI version starting with libfabric 1.13.  Added new fi_open API call.

   <b>ABI</b> <b>1.6</b>
       ABI version starting with libfabric 1.14.  Added fi_log_ready for providers.

   <b>ABI</b> <b>1.7</b>
       ABI version starting with libfabric 1.20.  Added new fields to the following attributes:

       <u>fi_domain_attr</u>
              Added max_ep_auth_key

   <b>ABI</b> <b>1.8</b>
       ABI version starting with libfabric 2.0.  Added new fi_fabric2 API call.  Added new fields to the follow‐
       ing attributes:

       <u>fi_domain_attr</u>
              Added max_group_id
