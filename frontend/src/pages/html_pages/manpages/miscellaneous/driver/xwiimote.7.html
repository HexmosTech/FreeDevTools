       XWiimote - Nintendo Wii Remote Linux Device Driver

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  XWiimote  driver  and  utilities  can  be used to connect a Nintendo Wii Remote to your computer. It
       consists of a linux kernel driver, a BlueZ Bluetooth plugin and user-space utilities.  They  replace  the
       old user-space drivers like <b>cwiid</b> or <b>wiiuse.</b>

       Since  bluez-4.96 the <b>wiimote</b> <b>plugin</b> is available upstream and you should be able to pair your Wii Remote
       like any other Bluetooth device. If pairing fails, simply connect the Wii Remote without pairing/bonding.
       The <b>linux</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>driver</b> for the Wii Remote is available since linux-3.1 and full support for Wii  Remotes
       since  linux-3.3.  It  is  called  <b>hid-wiimote</b>  and  requires  the  HID  core  drivers  to  be loaded. No
       configuration is needed for the driver and plugin.

       The user-space utilities provide a library that can be used to monitor and access connected  Wii  Remotes
       and they provide several applications to manage connected Wii Remotes.

   <b>Connecting</b> <b>Wii</b> <b>Remotes</b>
       To connect a Wii Remote to your host be sure that the official linux Bluetooth stack (BlueZ) is installed
       on  your  system  and  your kernel has the <b>hid-wiimote</b> kernel plugin loaded. Then connect your Wii Remote
       like any other Bluetooth device. The system  log  <b>(dmesg)</b>  should  print  some  messages  about  the  new
       connected device.

       The Wii Remote can be put into discoverable mode by pressing the red sync-button behind the battery cover
       on  the back. The Wii Remote will stay in discoverable mode for 20s. You can also hold the 1+2 buttons to
       put the Wii Remote into discoverable state. However, the first method works more reliably!   If  you  are
       asked  for  PIN  input  while bonding the devices, then your BlueZ bluetoothd daemon does not include the
       wiimote plugin. See <b>Bugs</b> below for more information. If this does not help, you can still connect to your
       Wii Remote without pairing/bonding (i.e. not using authentication with a PIN).  This should work with any
       BlueZ version.

   <b>User-Space</b> <b>Tools</b>
       If you have a Wii Remote connected to your host  you  can  test  it  with  the  <b><a href="../man1/xwiishow.1.html">xwiishow</a></b>(1)  application.
       However, if you do not have the <b>xwiimote</b> user-space tools installed, you can find Wii Remotes with
           <b>ls</b> <b>/sys/module/hid_wiimote/drivers/hid:wiimote/</b>
       They    are    listed    there    with   their   device   ID   inside   that   directory.   For   example
       <b>/sys/module/hid_wiimote/drivers/hid:wiimote/0005:057E:0306.0001</b>
       You can retrieve kernel information about the device by reading the files in this directory.

   <b>BlueZ</b> <b>wiimote</b> <b>plugin</b>
       Since bluez-4.96 the bluetooth daemon includes a special wiimote plugin  which  handles  wiimote  pairing
       requests.  If  you  pair  a Wii Remote, the plugin will automatically generate the right PIN and pair the
       device. If you are asked for PIN input, you either do not have this plugin installed or  your  device  is
       not detected. See <b>BUGS</b> for troubleshooting Wii Remote connection problems.

   <b>Wii</b> <b>Remote</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>driver</b>
       The  wiimote kernel driver is available since linux-3.1 in the official linux kernel. Since linux-3.2 the
       accelerometer and IR sensor are supported. Since linux-3.3 extension support is available.  There  is  no
       need  to  configure this driver. All configuration should be done in the user-space utilities. The kernel
       driver provides a simple abstraction layer which does not need any configuration.

       With linux-3.11 the driver was rewritten to support extension  hotplugging,  device  detection  and  more
       advanced functionality. It is highly recommended to use a kernel version greater than, or equal to 3.11.

   <b>libxwiimote</b>
       The kernel API for the Wii Remote is quite complex. It is documented in the xwiimote source repository in
       <b>doc/INTERFACE</b>
       To  help  application developers to use special Wii Remote functionality, we developed the <b><a href="../man7/libxwiimote.7.html">libxwiimote</a></b>(7)
       library which provides an easy API to manage connected Wii Remotes.

       If an application wants to use the IR or accelerometer sensors of a Wii Remote or if it requires advanced
       key-maps, it should use <b>libxwiimote</b> to access connected Wii Remotes.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Connecting</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wii</b> <b>Remote</b> <b>requires</b> <b>PIN</b> <b>input</b>
       If you are asked for PIN input while connecting your Wii Remote then you either do  not  have  the  BlueZ
       wiimote plugin installed or your device is not detected as a Wii Remote. This might happen with 3rd party
       Wii  Remotes  which  are not sold by Nintendo. You can still use these devices by connecting them without
       pairing or bonding. Tools like gnome-bluetooth require you to select "Use  no  PIN"  to  connect  devices
       without pairing/bonding.

       There  are attempts to improve the detection of Wii Remotes in BlueZ. If you are sure that your device is
       not detected properly, please report a bug upstream.

   <b>The</b> <b>X-Server</b> <b>reacts</b> <b>weirdly</b> <b>on</b> <b>Wii</b> <b>Remote</b> <b>input</b>
       By default the X-Server opens all input devices that are available on your machine. The Wii Remote  input
       devices  are  very useless without a proper keymap so you should instruct your X-Server to ignore raw Wii
       Remotes input devices.  The xwiimote source repository contains an xorg-config file  <b>res/50-xorg-disable-</b>
       <b>wiimote.conf</b>  which  can  be  installed  into  <b>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/</b>  to  ignore all raw Wii Remote input
       devices.
       This only ignores raw Wii Remote devices. If you used some of  the  user-space  utilities  to  remap  the
       buttons then the new devices will still be detected by your X-Server.
