       MooseFS  -  fault  tolerant, highly reliable, near indefinitely scalable, fast distributed file system in
       User Space

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MooseFS is a fault tolerant, distributed file system. It spreads data  over  several  physical  locations
       (servers),  which  are  visible to user as one resource. For standard file operations MooseFS acts as any
       other Unix-like filesystem:

       -      hierarchical structure (directory tree)

       -      stores POSIX file attributes (permissions, last access and modification times)

       -      supports special files (block and character devices, pipes and sockets)

       -      supports symbolic links (file names pointing to target files, not necessarily on MooseFS) and hard
              links (different names of files that refer to the same data on MooseFS)

       -      supports ACLs

       -      supports file locks across all connected client processes

       -      access to the file system can be limited based on IP address and/or password

       Distinctive features of MooseFS are:

       -      high reliability (several copies of the data can be stored on separate physical machines)

       -      capacity is dynamically expandable by adding new computers/disks

       -      deleted files are retained for a configurable period of time (a file system level ”trash bin”)

       -      coherent snapshots of files, even while the file is being written/accessed

       MooseFS consists of 4 key components:

       Master Servers
              in MooseFS CE one machine, in MooseFS Pro any number of machines  running  the  <b>mfsmaster</b>  binary,
              which  is  managing  the  whole  filesystem, storing metadata for every file (information on size,
              attributes  and  file  location(s),  including  all  information  about  non-regular  files,  i.e.
              directories, sockets, pipes and devices)

       Chunk Servers
              any  number  of  commodity servers running the <b>mfschunkserver</b> binary, which is storing files’ data
              and synchronizing it among themselves (if a certain file is supposed to exist  in  more  than  one
              copy).

       Metalogger Servers
              any number of servers running the <b>mfsmetalogger</b> binary, all of which store metadata changelogs and
              periodically download main metadata file

       Client Processes
              machines  running  the <b>mfsmount</b> processes, that access the files stored on MooseFS file system and
              expose them via a regular mount point inside a client's machine local directory tree

       Additionally, a number of tools can be installed to aid in using the system:

       CGI    a web based statistic and diagnostic tool (<b>mfscli.cgi</b>, comes with  its  own  simple  HTTP  server,
              <b>cgiserv</b>, but can be used with any standard HTTP server supporting cgi instead)

       CLI    command line statistic and diagnostic tool <b>mfscli</b>

       Block device
              Linux only special client process <b>mfsbdev</b> that maps single MooseFS files into block devices

       TOOLS  various command line administrative tools

</pre><h4><b>ARCHITECTURE</b></h4><pre>
       From  the  user’s  point of view, MooseFS behaves like a regular, POSIX compliant file system with almost
       indefinitely expandable capacity.  To achieve this, the system was designed as a distributed network file
       system, where different processes run on different machines, perform  specific  tasks  to  assure  proper
       performance  of  the whole file system.  Master Sever stores metadata information about files and manages
       the whole file system. In case of MooseFS Pro installation, with several Master Servers, only one of them
       (in the role of Leader) manages the system at any given time, the others (Followers) just keep up,  ready
       to pick up the Leader role at any time. The managing Master Server has following tasks: it stores all the
       metadata  of the file system (information about files and directories), it answers the requests of client
       (mount) processes when they want to perform any operation on the file system, it monitors  the  state  of
       Chunk Servers and stored data, sending replication or deletion requests to Chunk Servers when needed.

       Metadata  is  stored  in  the  memory of the Master Server and simultaneously saved on a local disk (as a
       periodically updated binary file and immediately updated incremental logs). The main binary file as  well
       as  the  logs are synchronized to the Metaloggers (if present) and to spare Master Servers in MooseFS Pro
       version.  Chunk Servers store actual file data. All data on the filesystem is divided into chunks  (hence
       the  name of the servers that keep them) of maximum size of 64 MiB. The chunks are kept in several copies
       on different servers according to appropriate policies to  ensure  safety  of  the  data.  Chunk  Servers
       communicate  with client processes (on client’s request, as directed by the master) to write or read file
       data. The chunks themselves are stored as regular files on local hard drive or drives.

       All file operations on a client computer that has mounted a MooseFS instance are exactly the same as they
       would be with any other file system. The operating system’s kernel transfers all file operations  to  the
       FUSE  module, which communicates with the <b>mfsmount</b> process. The <b>mfsmount</b> process communicates through the
       network subsequently with the managing server and data servers. This entire process is fully  transparent
       to the user.

       At  any  point  in time new Chunk Servers can be added to the system to expand the total available space.
       Also, new hard drives can be added to existing Chunk Servers. The Master Server will add the ”new”  space
       to the filesystem automatically. Thus, the system’s data capacity can be expanded almost indefinitely, as
       long as the Master Server is able to store all the relevant metadata information.  The Master Server will
       ensure that all the available physical disk space is used in as balanced manner as possible.

       In such a big system hardware failures will occur. MooseFS will automatically react in case of hard drive
       failure or whole Chunk Server failure. The safety of the data is ensured by storing it in several copies,
       according  to  defined  storage policies. After a failure the Master Server will start replication of the
       still existing copies in accordance with endangered file’s storage policy, to restore its required safety
       redundancy level as soon as possible.

       Failures of a client machine (that runs the <b>mfsmount</b> process) will have no influence on the coherence  of
       the file system or on the other clients’ operations. In the worst case scenario the data that has not yet
       been sent from the failed client computer to the Master Server and/or Chunk Servers may be lost.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>PLATFORMS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mfsmount</b>  is  based  on  the  FUSE mechanism (Filesystem in USErspace), so MooseFS client is available on
       every Operating System with a working FUSE implementation.

       The Master Server, Metalogger and Chunk Servers can be run on  any  POSIX  compliant  OS  on  most  major
       processor  types  and  architectures. 32-bit processors will work too, but beware of RAM handicap and the
       consequences of it. Use of 64-bit versions of operating systems is highly recommended.
