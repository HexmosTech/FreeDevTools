       RegDiff - Differences Between Funtools and IRAF Regions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Describes the differences between Funtools/ds9 regions and the old IRAF/PROS regions.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       We  have  tried to make Funtools regions compatible with their predecessor, IRAF/PROS regions. For simple
       regions and simple boolean algebra between regions,  there  should  be  no  difference  between  the  two
       implementations.  The following is a list of differences and incompatibilities between the two:

       •   If  a  pixel  is covered by two different regions expressions, Funtools assigns the mask value of the
           <b>first</b> region that contains that pixel.  That is, successive regions <b>do</b> <b>not</b> overwrite previous regions
           in the mask, as was the case with the original  PROS  regions.   This  means  that  one  must  define
           overlapping  regions  in  the reverse order in which they were defined in PROS.  If region N is fully
           contained within region M, then N should be defined <b>before</b> M, or else it will be "covered up" by  the
           latter.  This  change is necessitated by the use of optimized filter compilation, i.e., Funtools only
           tests individual regions until a proper match is made.

       •   The <b>PANDA</b> region has replaced the old PROS syntax in which a <b>PIE</b> accelerator  was  combined  with  an
           <b>ANNULUS</b> accelerator using <b>AND</b>. That is,

             ANNULUS(20,20,0,15,n=4) &amp; PIE(20,20,0,360,n=3)

           has been replaced by:

             PANDA(20,20,0,360,3,0,15,4)

           The PROS syntax was inconsistent with the meaning of the <b>AND</b> operator.

       •   The  meaning  of pure numbers (i.e., without format specifiers) in regions has been clarified, as has
           the syntax for specifying coordinate systems. See the general discussion on Spatial Region  Filtering
           for more information.
