</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lxc - linux containers

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       The  container technology is actively being pushed into the mainstream Linux kernel. It provides resource
       management through control groups and resource isolation via namespaces.

       <b>lxc</b>, aims to use these new functionalities to provide a userspace container object  which  provides  full
       resource isolation and resource control for an applications or a full system.

       <b>lxc</b> is small enough to easily manage a container with simple command lines and complete enough to be used
       for other purposes.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The  kernel  version  &gt;=  3.10  shipped  with  the  distros,  will work with <b>lxc</b>, this one will have less
       functionalities but enough to be interesting.

       <b>lxc</b> relies on a set of functionalities provided by the kernel. The  helper  script  <b>lxc-checkconfig</b>  will
       give you information about your kernel configuration, required, and missing features.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONAL</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       A  container  is an object isolating some resources of the host, for the application or system running in
       it.

       The application / system will be launched inside a container specified by a configuration that is  either
       initially created or passed as a parameter of the commands.

       How to run an application in a container

       Before  running  an  application, you should know what are the resources you want to isolate. The default
       configuration is to isolate PIDs, the sysv IPC and mount points. If you want to run a simple shell inside
       a container, a basic configuration is needed, especially if you want to share the rootfs. If you want  to
       run  an  application like <b>sshd</b>, you should provide a new network stack and a new hostname. If you want to
       avoid conflicts with some files eg.  <u>/var/run/httpd.pid</u>,  you  should  remount  <u><a href="file:/var/run">/var/run</a></u>  with  an  empty
       directory.  If  you  want  to  avoid  the  conflicts  in  all the cases, you can specify a rootfs for the
       container. The rootfs can be a directory tree, previously bind mounted with the initial  rootfs,  so  you
       can still use your distro but with your own <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/home">/home</a></u>

       Here is an example of directory tree for <b>sshd</b>:

       [root@lxc sshd]$ tree -d rootfs

       rootfs
       |-- bin
       |-- dev
       |   |-- pts
       |   `-- shm
       |       `-- network
       |-- etc
       |   `-- ssh
       |-- lib
       |-- proc
       |-- root
       |-- sbin
       |-- sys
       |-- usr
       `-- var
           |-- empty
           |   `-- sshd
           |-- lib
           |   `-- empty
           |       `-- sshd
           `-- run
               `-- sshd

       and the mount points file associated with it:

            [root@lxc sshd]$ cat fstab

            <a href="file:/lib">/lib</a> /home/root/sshd/rootfs/lib none ro,bind 0 0
            <a href="file:/bin">/bin</a> /home/root/sshd/rootfs/bin none ro,bind 0 0
            <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> /home/root/sshd/rootfs/usr none ro,bind 0 0
            <a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a> /home/root/sshd/rootfs/sbin none ro,bind 0 0

       How to run a system in a container

       Running a system inside a container is paradoxically easier than running an application. Why? Because you
       don't  have  to  care  about  the  resources  to  be isolated, everything needs to be isolated, the other
       resources are specified as being isolated but without configuration because the container will  set  them
       up.  eg.  the  ipv4 address will be setup by the system container init scripts. Here is an example of the
       mount points file:

            [root@lxc debian]$ cat fstab

            <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a> /home/root/debian/rootfs/dev none bind 0 0
            <a href="file:/dev/pts">/dev/pts</a> /home/root/debian/rootfs/dev/pts  none bind 0 0

   <b>CONTAINER</b> <b>LIFE</b> <b>CYCLE</b>
       When the container is created, it contains the configuration information. When a process is launched, the
       container will be starting and running. When the last process running inside  the  container  exits,  the
       container is stopped.

       In case of failure when the container is initialized, it will pass through the aborting state.

               ---------------------

   <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       The  container  is  configured  through  a  configuration  file,  the format of the configuration file is
       described in <u><a href="../man5/lxc.conf.5.html">lxc.conf</a></u>(5)

   <b>CREATING</b> <b>/</b> <b>DESTROYING</b> <b>CONTAINERS</b>
       A persistent container object can be created via the <b>lxc-create</b> command. It takes  a  container  name  as
       parameter  and  optional  configuration  file and template. The name is used by the different commands to
       refer to this container. The <b>lxc-destroy</b> command will destroy the container object.

              lxc-create -n foo
              lxc-destroy -n foo

   <b>VOLATILE</b> <b>CONTAINER</b>
       It is not mandatory to create a container object before starting  it.   The  container  can  be  directly
       started with a configuration file as parameter.

   <b>STARTING</b> <b>/</b> <b>STOPPING</b> <b>CONTAINER</b>
       When  the  container has been created, it is ready to run an application / system. This is the purpose of
       the <b>lxc-execute</b> and <b>lxc-start</b> commands. If the container was not created before starting the application,
       the container will use the configuration file passed as parameter to the command, and if there is no such
       parameter either, then it will use a default isolation. If the application ended, the container  will  be
       stopped, but if needed the <b>lxc-stop</b> command can be used to stop the container.

       Running  an  application  inside  a container is not exactly the same thing as running a system. For this
       reason, there are two different commands to run an application into a container:

              lxc-execute -n foo [-f config] <a href="file:/bin/bash">/bin/bash</a>
              lxc-start -n foo [-f config] [<a href="file:/bin/bash">/bin/bash</a>]

       The <b>lxc-execute</b> command will run the specified command into a container via an intermediate process, <b>lxc-</b>
       <b>init</b>.  This lxc-init after launching the  specified  command,  will  wait  for  its  end  and  all  other
       reparented  processes.  (to support daemons in the container). In other words, in the container, <b>lxc-init</b>
       has PID 1 and the first process of the application has PID 2.

       The <b>lxc-start</b> command will directly run the specified command in the container.  The  PID  of  the  first
       process is 1. If no command is specified <b>lxc-start</b> will run the command defined in lxc.init.cmd or if not
       set, <u><a href="file:/sbin/init">/sbin/init</a></u> .

       To  summarize,  <b>lxc-execute</b>  is  for  running an application and <b>lxc-start</b> is better suited for running a
       system.

       If the application is no longer responding, is inaccessible or is not able to finish by  itself,  a  wild
       <b>lxc-stop</b> command will kill all the processes in the container without pity.

              lxc-stop -n foo -k

   <b>CONNECT</b> <b>TO</b> <b>AN</b> <b>AVAILABLE</b> <b>TTY</b>
       If  the  container  is  configured  with  ttys, it is possible to access it through them. It is up to the
       container to provide a set of available ttys to be used by the following command. When the tty  is  lost,
       it is possible to reconnect to it without login again.

              lxc-console -n foo -t 3

   <b>FREEZE</b> <b>/</b> <b>UNFREEZE</b> <b>CONTAINER</b>
       Sometime,  it  is  useful to stop all the processes belonging to a container, eg. for job scheduling. The
       commands:

              lxc-freeze -n foo

       will put all the processes in an uninteruptible state and

              lxc-unfreeze -n foo

       will resume them.

       This feature is enabled if the freezer cgroup v1 controller is enabled in the kernel.

   <b>GETTING</b> <b>INFORMATION</b> <b>ABOUT</b> <b>CONTAINER</b>
       When there are a lot of containers, it is hard to follow what has been  created  or  destroyed,  what  is
       running or what are the PIDs running in a specific container. For this reason, the following commands may
       be useful:

              lxc-ls -f
              lxc-info -n foo

       <b>lxc-ls</b> lists containers.

       <b>lxc-info</b> gives information for a specific container.

       Here  is  an  example  on how the combination of these commands allows one to list all the containers and
       retrieve their state.

              for i in $(lxc-ls -1); do
                lxc-info -n $i
              done

   <b>MONITORING</b> <b>CONTAINER</b>
       It is sometime useful to track the states of a container, for example to monitor it or just to wait for a
       specific state in a script.

       <b>lxc-monitor</b> command will monitor one or several containers. The  parameter  of  this  command  accepts  a
       regular expression for example:

              lxc-monitor -n "foo|bar"

       will monitor the states of containers named 'foo' and 'bar', and:

              lxc-monitor -n ".*"

       will monitor all the containers.

       For a container 'foo' starting, doing some work and exiting, the output will be in the form:

              'foo' changed state to [STARTING]
              'foo' changed state to [RUNNING]
              'foo' changed state to [STOPPING]
              'foo' changed state to [STOPPED]

       <b>lxc-wait</b>  command  will  wait  for  a  specific  state  change  and exit. This is useful for scripting to
       synchronize the launch of a container or the end. The parameter  is  an  ORed  combination  of  different
       states. The following example shows how to wait for a container if it successfully started as a daemon.

              # launch lxc-wait in background
              lxc-wait -n foo -s STOPPED &amp;
              LXC_WAIT_PID=$!

              # this command goes in background
              lxc-execute -n foo mydaemon &amp;

              # block until the lxc-wait exits
              # and lxc-wait exits when the container
              # is STOPPED
              wait $LXC_WAIT_PID
              echo "'foo' is finished"

   <b>CGROUP</b> <b>SETTINGS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CONTAINERS</b>
       The container is tied with the control groups, when a container is started a control group is created and
       associated  with  it. The control group properties can be read and modified when the container is running
       by using the lxc-cgroup command.

       <b>lxc-cgroup</b> command is used to set or get a control group subsystem which is associated with a  container.
       The  subsystem  name  is  handled  by the user, the command won't do any syntax checking on the subsystem
       name, if the subsystem name does not exists, the command will fail.

              lxc-cgroup -n foo cpuset.cpus

       will display the content of this subsystem.

              lxc-cgroup -n foo cpu.shares 512

       will set the subsystem to the specified value.
