           DESCRIPTION
               "This MIB module defines textual conventions for
                representing Internet addresses.  An Internet
                address can be an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address,
                or a DNS domain name.  This module also defines
                textual conventions for Internet port numbers,
                autonomous system numbers, and the length of an
                Internet address prefix.

                of this MIB module is part of RFC 4001, see the RFC

                            be used if the value of the corresponding
                            InetAddress object is a zero-length string.
                            It may also be used to indicate an IP address
                            that is not in one of the formats defined

                            InetAddressDNS textual convention.

                Each definition of a concrete InetAddressType value must be
                accompanied by a definition of a textual convention for use
                with that InetAddressType.

                To support future extensions, the InetAddressType textual
                convention SHOULD NOT be sub-typed in object type definitions.
                It MAY be sub-typed in compliance statements in order to
                require only a subset of these address types for a compliant
                implementation.

                Implementations must ensure that InetAddressType objects
                and any dependent objects (e.g., InetAddress objects) are
                consistent.  An inconsistentValue error must be generated
                if an attempt to change an InetAddressType object would,
                for example, lead to an undefined InetAddress value.  In

                particular, InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs must be
                changed together if the address type changes (e.g., from
                <a href="../man2/ipv6.2.html">ipv6</a>(2) to <a href="../man1/ipv4.1.html">ipv4</a>(1))."

               "Denotes a generic Internet address.

                An InetAddress value is always interpreted within the context
                of an InetAddressType value.  Every usage of the InetAddress
                textual convention is required to specify the InetAddressType
                object that provides the context.  It is suggested that the
                InetAddressType object be logically registered before the
                object(s) that use the InetAddress textual convention, if
                they appear in the same logical row.

                The value of an InetAddress object must always be
                consistent with the value of the associated InetAddressType
                object.  Attempts to set an InetAddress object to a value
                inconsistent with the associated InetAddressType
                must fail with an inconsistentValue error.

                When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an
                index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
                sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58.  In this case,
                the object definition MUST include a 'SIZE' clause to
                limit the number of potential instance sub-identifiers;
                otherwise the applicable constraints MUST be stated in
                the appropriate conceptual row DESCRIPTION clauses, or
                in the surrounding documentation if there is no single
                DESCRIPTION clause that is appropriate."

                that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most significant

                An InetAddressPrefixLength value is always interpreted within

                InetAddressPrefixLength textual convention, if they appear
                in the same logical row.

                InetAddressPrefixLength values larger than
                the maximum length of an IP address for a specific
                InetAddressType are treated as the maximum significant

                Autonomous system numbers are currently limited to 16 bits

       InetScopeType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
           STATUS       current
           DESCRIPTION
               "Represents a scope type.  This textual convention can be used
                in cases where a MIB has to represent different scope types
                and there is no context information, such as an InetAddress
                object, that implicitly defines the scope type.

                Note that not all possible values have been assigned yet, but
                they may be assigned in future revisions of this specification.
                Applications should therefore be able to deal with values
                not yet assigned."

           DISPLAY-HINT "d"
           STATUS       current
           DESCRIPTION
               "A zone index identifies an instance of a zone of a
                specific scope.

                The zone index MUST disambiguate identical address
                values.  For link-local addresses, the zone index will
                typically be the interface index (ifIndex as defined in the
                IF-MIB) of the interface on which the address is configured.

                The zone index may contain the special value 0, which refers
                to the default zone.  The default zone may be used in cases
                where the valid zone index is not known (e.g., when a
                management application has to write a link-local IPv6
                address without knowing the interface index value).  The
                default zone SHOULD NOT be used as an easy way out in
                cases where the zone index for a non-global IPv6 address
                is known."
