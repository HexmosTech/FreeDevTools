       ossl-guide-quic-multi-stream - OpenSSL Guide: Writing a simple multi-stream QUIC client

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       This page will introduce some important concepts required to write a simple QUIC multi-stream
       application. It assumes a basic understanding of QUIC and how it is used in OpenSSL. See
       <b><a href="../man7/ossl-guide-quic-introduction.7.html">ossl-guide-quic-introduction</a></b>(7) and <b><a href="../man7/ossl-guide-quic-client-block.7.html">ossl-guide-quic-client-block</a></b>(7).

</pre><h4><b>QUIC</b> <b>STREAMS</b></h4><pre>
       In a QUIC multi-stream application we separate out the concepts of a QUIC "connection" and a QUIC
       "stream". A connection object represents the overarching details of the connection between a client and a
       server including all its negotiated and configured parameters. We use the <b>SSL</b> object for that in an
       OpenSSL application (known as the connection <b>SSL</b> object). It is created by an application calling
       <b><a href="../man3/SSL_new.3.html">SSL_new</a></b>(3).

       Separately a connection can have zero or more streams associated with it (although a connection with zero
       streams is probably not very useful, so normally you would have at least one). A stream is used to send
       and receive data between the two peers. Each stream is also represented by an <b>SSL</b> object. A stream is
       logically independent of all the other streams associated with the same connection. Data sent on a stream
       is guaranteed to be delivered in the order that it was sent within that stream. The same is not true
       across streams, e.g. if an application sends data on stream 1 first and then sends some more data on
       stream 2 second, then the remote peer may receive the data sent on stream 2 before it receives the data
       sent on stream 1.

       Once the connection <b>SSL</b> object has completed its handshake (i.e.  <b><a href="../man3/SSL_connect.3.html">SSL_connect</a></b>(3) has returned 1), stream
       <b>SSL</b> objects are created by the application calling <b><a href="../man3/SSL_new_stream.3.html">SSL_new_stream</a></b>(3) or <b><a href="../man3/SSL_accept_stream.3.html">SSL_accept_stream</a></b>(3) (see
       "CREATING NEW STREAMS" below).

       The same threading rules apply to <b>SSL</b> objects as for most OpenSSL objects (see
       <b><a href="../man7/ossl-guide-libraries-introduction.7.html">ossl-guide-libraries-introduction</a></b>(7)). In particular most OpenSSL functions are thread safe, but the <b>SSL</b>
       object is not. This means that you can use an <b>SSL</b> object representing one stream at the same time as
       another thread is using a different <b>SSL</b> object for a different stream on the same connection. But you
       cannot use the same <b>SSL</b> object on two different threads at the same time (without additional application
       level locking).

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>DEFAULT</b> <b>STREAM</b></h4><pre>
       A connection <b>SSL</b> object may also (optionally) be associated with a stream.  This stream is known as the
       default stream. The default stream is automatically created and associated with the <b>SSL</b> object when the
       application calls <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read_ex.3.html">SSL_read_ex</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read.3.html">SSL_read</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/SSL_write_ex.3.html">SSL_write_ex</a></b>(3) or <b><a href="../man3/SSL_write.3.html">SSL_write</a></b>(3) and passes the connection
       <b>SSL</b> object as a parameter.

       If a client application calls <b><a href="../man3/SSL_write_ex.3.html">SSL_write_ex</a></b>(3) or <b><a href="../man3/SSL_write.3.html">SSL_write</a></b>(3) first then (by default) the default stream
       will be a client-initiated bi-directional stream. If a client application calls <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read_ex.3.html">SSL_read_ex</a></b>(3) or
       <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read.3.html">SSL_read</a></b>(3) first then the first stream initiated by the server will be used as the default stream
       (whether it is bi-directional or uni-directional).

       This behaviour can be controlled via the default stream mode. See <b><a href="../man3/SSL_set_default_stream_mode.3.html">SSL_set_default_stream_mode</a></b>(3) for
       further details.

       It is recommended that new multi-stream applications should not use a default stream at all and instead
       should use a separate stream <b>SSL</b> object for each stream that is used. This requires calling
       <b><a href="../man3/SSL_set_default_stream_mode.3.html">SSL_set_default_stream_mode</a></b>(3) and setting the mode to <b>SSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_MODE_NONE</b>.

</pre><h4><b>CREATING</b> <b>NEW</b> <b>STREAMS</b></h4><pre>
       An endpoint can create a new stream by calling <b><a href="../man3/SSL_new_stream.3.html">SSL_new_stream</a></b>(3). This creates a locally initiated
       stream. In order to do so you must pass the QUIC connection <b>SSL</b> object as a parameter. You can also
       specify whether you want a bi-directional or a uni-directional stream.

       The function returns a new QUIC stream <b>SSL</b> object for sending and receiving data on that stream.

       The peer may also initiate streams. An application can use the function
       <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get_accept_stream_queue_len.3.html">SSL_get_accept_stream_queue_len</a></b>(3) to determine the number of streams that the peer has initiated that
       are waiting for the application to handle. An application can call <b><a href="../man3/SSL_accept_stream.3.html">SSL_accept_stream</a></b>(3) to create a new
       <b>SSL</b> object for a remotely initiated stream. If the peer has not initiated any then this call will block
       until one is available if the connection object is in blocking mode (see <b><a href="../man3/SSL_set_blocking_mode.3.html">SSL_set_blocking_mode</a></b>(3)).

       When using a default stream OpenSSL will prevent new streams from being accepted. To override this
       behaviour you must call <b><a href="../man3/SSL_set_incoming_stream_policy.3.html">SSL_set_incoming_stream_policy</a></b>(3) to set the policy to
       <b>SSL_INCOMING_STREAM_POLICY_ACCEPT</b>. See the man page for further details. This is not relevant if the
       default stream has been disabled as described in "THE DEFAULT STREAM" above.

       Any stream may be bi-directional or uni-directional. If it is uni-directional then the initiator can
       write to it but not read from it, and vice-versa for the peer. You can determine what type of stream an
       <b>SSL</b> object represents by calling <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get_stream_type.3.html">SSL_get_stream_type</a></b>(3). See the man page for further details.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>A</b> <b>STREAM</b> <b>TO</b> <b>SEND</b> <b>AND</b> <b>RECEIVE</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       Once you have a stream <b>SSL</b> object (which includes the connection <b>SSL</b> object if a default stream is in
       use) then you can send and receive data over it using the <b><a href="../man3/SSL_write_ex.3.html">SSL_write_ex</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/SSL_write.3.html">SSL_write</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read_ex.3.html">SSL_read_ex</a></b>(3)
       or <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read.3.html">SSL_read</a></b>(3) functions. See the man pages for further details.

       In the event of one of these functions not returning a success code then you should call <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get_error.3.html">SSL_get_error</a></b>(3)
       to find out further details about the error.  In blocking mode this will either be a fatal error (e.g.
       <b>SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL</b> or <b>SSL_ERROR_SSL</b>), or it will be <b>SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN</b> which can occur when attempting
       to read data from a stream and the peer has indicated that the stream is concluded (i.e. "FIN" has been
       signalled on the stream). This means that the peer will send no more data on that stream. Note that the
       interpretation of <b>SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN</b> is slightly different for a QUIC application compared to a TLS
       application. In TLS it occurs when the connection has been shutdown by the peer. In QUIC this only tells
       you that the current stream has been concluded by the peer. It tells you nothing about the underlying
       connection. If the peer has concluded the stream then no more data will be received on it, however an
       application can still send data to the peer until the send side of the stream has also been concluded.
       This can happen by the application calling <b><a href="../man3/SSL_stream_conclude.3.html">SSL_stream_conclude</a></b>(3). It is an error to attempt to send more
       data on a stream after <b><a href="../man3/SSL_stream_conclude.3.html">SSL_stream_conclude</a></b>(3) has been called.

       It is also possible to abandon a stream abnormally by calling <b><a href="../man3/SSL_stream_reset.3.html">SSL_stream_reset</a></b>(3).

       Once a stream object is no longer needed it should be freed via a call to <b><a href="../man3/SSL_free.3.html">SSL_free</a></b>(3). An application
       should not call <b><a href="../man3/SSL_shutdown.3.html">SSL_shutdown</a></b>(3) on it since this is only meaningful for connection level <b>SSL</b> objects.
       Freeing the stream will automatically signal STOP_SENDING to the peer.

</pre><h4><b>STREAMS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CONNECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Given a stream object it is possible to get the <b>SSL</b> object corresponding to the connection via a call to
       <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get0_connection.3.html">SSL_get0_connection</a></b>(3). Multi-threaded restrictions apply so care should be taken when using the returned
       connection object. Specifically, if you are handling each of your stream objects in a different thread
       and call <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get0_connection.3.html">SSL_get0_connection</a></b>(3) from within that thread then you must be careful to not to call any
       function that uses the connection object at the same time as one of the other threads is also using that
       connection object (with the exception of <b><a href="../man3/SSL_accept_stream.3.html">SSL_accept_stream</a></b>(3) and <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get_accept_stream_queue_len.3.html">SSL_get_accept_stream_queue_len</a></b>(3)
       which are thread-safe).

       A stream object does not inherit all its settings and values from its parent <b>SSL</b> connection object.
       Therefore certain function calls that are relevant to the connection as a whole will not work on a
       stream. For example the function <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get_certificate.3.html">SSL_get_certificate</a></b>(3) can be used to obtain a handle on the peer
       certificate when called with a connection <b>SSL</b> object. When called with a stream <b>SSL</b> object it will return
       NULL.

</pre><h4><b>SIMPLE</b> <b>MULTI-STREAM</b> <b>QUIC</b> <b>CLIENT</b> <b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       This section will present various source code samples demonstrating how to write a simple multi-stream
       QUIC client application which connects to a server, send some HTTP/1.0 requests to it, and read back the
       responses. Note that HTTP/1.0 over QUIC is non-standard and will not be supported by real world servers.
       This is for demonstration purposes only.

       We will build on the example code for the simple blocking QUIC client that is covered on the
       <b><a href="../man7/ossl-guide-quic-client-block.7.html">ossl-guide-quic-client-block</a></b>(7) page and we assume that you are familiar with it. We will only describe
       the differences between the simple blocking QUIC client and the multi-stream QUIC client. Although the
       example code uses blocking <b>SSL</b> objects, you can equally use nonblocking <b>SSL</b> objects.  See
       <b><a href="../man7/ossl-guide-quic-client-non-block.7.html">ossl-guide-quic-client-non-block</a></b>(7) for more information about writing a nonblocking QUIC client.

       The complete source code for this example multi-stream QUIC client is available in the "demos/guide"
       directory of the OpenSSL source distribution in the file "quic-multi-stream.c". It is also available
       online at &lt;https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/demos/guide/quic-multi-stream.c&gt;.

   <b>Disabling</b> <b>the</b> <b>default</b> <b>stream</b>
       As discussed above in "THE DEFAULT STREAM" we will follow the recommendation to disable the default
       stream for our multi-stream client. To do this we call the <b><a href="../man3/SSL_set_default_stream_mode.3.html">SSL_set_default_stream_mode</a></b>(3) function and
       pass in our connection <b>SSL</b> object and the value <b>SSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_MODE_NONE</b>.

           /*
            * We will use multiple streams so we will disable the default stream mode.
            * This is not a requirement for using multiple streams but is recommended.
            */
           if (!SSL_set_default_stream_mode(ssl, SSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_MODE_NONE)) {
               printf("Failed to disable the default stream mode\n");
               goto end;
           }

   <b>Creating</b> <b>the</b> <b>request</b> <b>streams</b>
       For the purposes of this example we will create two different streams to send two different HTTP requests
       to the server. For the purposes of demonstration the first of these will be a bi-directional stream and
       the second one will be a uni-directional one:

           /*
            * We create two new client initiated streams. The first will be
            * bi-directional, and the second will be uni-directional.
            */
           stream1 = SSL_new_stream(ssl, 0);
           stream2 = SSL_new_stream(ssl, SSL_STREAM_FLAG_UNI);
           if (stream1 == NULL || stream2 == NULL) {
               printf("Failed to create streams\n");
               goto end;
           }

   <b>Writing</b> <b>data</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streams</b>
       Once the streams are successfully created we can start writing data to them. In this example we will be
       sending a different HTTP request on each stream. To avoid repeating too much code we write a simple
       helper function to send an HTTP request to a stream:

           int write_a_request(SSL *stream, const char *request_start,
                               const char *hostname)
           {
               const char *request_end = "\r\n\r\n";
               size_t written;

               if (!SSL_write_ex(stream, request_start, strlen(request_start), &amp;written))
                   return 0;
               if (!SSL_write_ex(stream, hostname, strlen(hostname), &amp;written))
                   return 0;
               if (!SSL_write_ex(stream, request_end, strlen(request_end), &amp;written))
                   return 0;

               return 1;
           }

       We assume the strings <b>request1_start</b> and <b>request2_start</b> hold the appropriate HTTP requests. We can then
       call our helper function above to send the requests on the two streams. For the sake of simplicity this
       example does this sequentially, writing to <b>stream1</b> first and, when this is successful, writing to <b>stream2</b>
       second. Remember that our client is blocking so these calls will only return once they have been
       successfully completed. A real application would not need to do these writes sequentially or in any
       particular order. For example we could start two threads (one for each stream) and write the requests to
       each stream simultaneously.

           /* Write an HTTP GET request on each of our streams to the peer */
           if (!write_a_request(stream1, request1_start, hostname)) {
               printf("Failed to write HTTP request on stream 1\n");
               goto end;
           }

           if (!write_a_request(stream2, request2_start, hostname)) {
               printf("Failed to write HTTP request on stream 2\n");
               goto end;
           }

   <b>Reading</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>stream</b>
       In this example <b>stream1</b> is a bi-directional stream so, once we have sent the request on it, we can
       attempt to read the response from the server back. Here we just repeatedly call <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read_ex.3.html">SSL_read_ex</a></b>(3) until that
       function fails (indicating either that there has been a problem, or that the peer has signalled the
       stream as concluded).

           printf("Stream 1 data:\n");
           /*
            * Get up to sizeof(buf) bytes of the response from stream 1 (which is a
            * bidirectional stream). We keep reading until the server closes the
            * connection.
            */
           while (SSL_read_ex(stream1, buf, sizeof(buf), &amp;readbytes)) {
               /*
               * OpenSSL does not guarantee that the returned data is a string or
               * that it is NUL terminated so we use fwrite() to write the exact
               * number of bytes that we read. The data could be non-printable or
               * have NUL characters in the middle of it. For this simple example
               * we're going to print it to stdout anyway.
               */
               fwrite(buf, 1, readbytes, stdout);
           }
           /* In case the response didn't finish with a newline we add one now */
           printf("\n");

       In a blocking application like this one calls to <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read_ex.3.html">SSL_read_ex</a></b>(3) will either succeed immediately returning
       data that is already available, or they will block waiting for more data to become available and return
       it when it is, or they will fail with a 0 response code.

       Once we exit the while loop above we know that the last call to <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read_ex.3.html">SSL_read_ex</a></b>(3) gave a 0 response code so
       we call the <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get_error.3.html">SSL_get_error</a></b>(3) function to find out more details. Since this is a blocking application this
       will either return <b>SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL</b> or <b>SSL_ERROR_SSL</b> indicating a fundamental problem, or it will return
       <b>SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN</b> indicating that the stream is concluded and there will be no more data available to
       read from it. Care must be taken to distinguish between an error at the stream level (i.e.  a stream
       reset) and an error at the connection level (i.e. a connection closed).  The <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get_stream_read_state.3.html">SSL_get_stream_read_state</a></b>(3)
       function can be used to distinguish between these different cases.

           /*
            * Check whether we finished the while loop above normally or as the
            * result of an error. The 0 argument to SSL_get_error() is the return
            * code we received from the SSL_read_ex() call. It must be 0 in order
            * to get here. Normal completion is indicated by SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN. In
            * QUIC terms this means that the peer has sent FIN on the stream to
            * indicate that no further data will be sent.
            */
           switch (SSL_get_error(stream1, 0)) {

               printf("Failed to accept a new stream\n");
               goto end;
           }

       We can now read data from the stream in the same way that we did for <b>stream1</b> above. We won't repeat that
       here.

   <b>Cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>streams</b>
       Once we have finished using our streams we can simply free them by calling <b><a href="../man3/SSL_free.3.html">SSL_free</a></b>(3). Optionally we
       could call <b><a href="../man3/SSL_stream_conclude.3.html">SSL_stream_conclude</a></b>(3) on them if we want to indicate to the peer that we won't be sending
       them any more data, but we don't do that in this example because we assume that the HTTP application
       protocol supplies sufficient information for the peer to know when we have finished sending request data.

       We should not call <b><a href="../man3/SSL_shutdown.3.html">SSL_shutdown</a></b>(3) or <b><a href="../man3/SSL_shutdown_ex.3.html">SSL_shutdown_ex</a></b>(3) on the stream objects since those calls should
       not be used for streams.

           SSL_free(stream1);
           SSL_free(stream2);
           SSL_free(stream3);
