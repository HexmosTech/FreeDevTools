</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tigmanual - text-mode interface for Git

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       tig        [options] [revisions] [--] [paths]
       tig show   [options] [revisions] [--] [paths]
       tig blame  [options] [rev] [--] path
       tig status
       tig &lt;      [Git command output]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the manual for Tig, the ncurses-based text-mode interface for git. Tig allows you to browse
       changes in a Git repository and can additionally act as a pager for output of various Git commands. When
       used as a pager, it will display input from stdin and colorize it.

       When browsing repositories, Tig uses the underlying Git commands to present the user with various views,
       such as summarized commit log and showing the commit with the log message, diffstat, and the diff.

</pre><h4><b>CALLING</b> <b>CONVENTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Pager</b> <b>Mode</b>
       If stdin is a pipe, any log or diff options will be ignored and the pager view will be opened loading
       data from stdin. The pager mode can be used for colorizing output from various Git commands.

       Example on how to colorize the output of <a href="../man1/git-show.1.html">git-show</a>(1):

           $ git show | tig

   <b>Git</b> <b>Command</b> <b>Options</b>
       All Git command options specified on the command line will be passed to the given command and all will be
       shell quoted before they are passed to the shell.

           <b>Note</b>

           If you specify options for the main view, you should not use the --pretty option as this option will
           be set automatically to the format expected by the main view.

       Example on how to view a commit and show both author and committer information:

           $ tig show --pretty=fuller

       See the section on specifying revisions for an introduction to revision options supported by the Git
       commands. For details on specific Git command options, refer to the man page of the command in question.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>VIEWER</b></h4><pre>
       The display consists of a status window on the last line of the screen and one or more views. The default
       is to only show one view at a time but it is possible to split both the main and log view to also show
       the commit diff.

       If you are in the log view and press <u>Enter</u> when the current line is a commit line, such as:

           commit 4d55caff4cc89335192f3e566004b4ceef572521

       You will split the view so that the log view is displayed in the top window and the diff view in the
       bottom window. You can switch between the two views by pressing <u>Tab</u>. To maximize the log view again,
       simply press <u>l</u>.

   <b>Views</b>
       Various <u>views</u> of a repository are presented. Each view is based on output from an external command, most
       often <u>git</u> <u>log</u>, <u>git</u> <u>diff</u>, or <u>git</u> <u>show</u>.

       The main view
           Is the default view, and it shows a one line summary of each commit in the chosen list of revisions.
           The summary includes author date, author, and the first line of the log message. Additionally, any
           repository references, such as tags, will be shown.

       The log view
           Presents a more rich view of the revision log showing the whole log message and the diffstat.

       The reflog view
           Presents a view of the reflog allowing to navigate the repo history.

       The diff view
           Shows either the diff of the current working tree, that is, what has changed since the last commit,
           or the commit diff complete with log message, diffstat and diff.

       The tree view
           Lists directory trees associated with the current revision allowing subdirectories to be descended or
           ascended and file blobs to be viewed.

       The blob view
           Displays the file content or "blob" of data associated with a file name.

       The blame view
           Displays the file content annotated or blamed by commits.

       The refs view
           Displays the branches, remotes and tags in the repository.

       The status view
           Displays status of files in the working tree and allows changes to be staged/unstaged as well as
           adding of untracked files.

       The stage view
           Displays diff changes for staged or unstaged files being tracked or file content of untracked files.

       The stash view
           Displays the list of stashes in the repository.

       The grep view
           Displays a list of files and all the lines that matches a search pattern.

       The pager view
           Is used for displaying both input from stdin and output from Git commands entered in the internal
           prompt.

       The help view
           Displays a quick reference of key bindings.

   <b>Browsing</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>User-defined</b> <b>Commands</b>
       The viewer keeps track of both what head and commit ID you are currently viewing. The commit ID will
       follow the cursor line and change every time you highlight a different commit. Whenever you reopen the
       diff view it will be reloaded, if the commit ID changed. The head ID is used when opening the main and
       log view to indicate from what revision to show history.

       Some of the commands used or provided by Tig can be configured. This goes for some of the environment
       variables as well as the external commands. These user-defined commands can use arguments that refer to
       the current browsing state by using one of the following variables.

   <b>Title</b> <b>Windows</b>
       Each view has a title window which shows the name of the view, current commit ID if available, and where
       the view is positioned:

           [main] c622eefaa485995320bc743431bae0d497b1d875 - commit 1 of 61 (1%)

       By default, the title of the current view is highlighted using bold font. For long loading views (taking
       over 3 seconds) the time since loading started will be appended:

           [main] 77d9e40fbcea3238015aea403e06f61542df9a31 - commit 1 of 779 (0%) 5s

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Several options related to the interface with Git can be configured via environment options.

   <b>Configuration</b> <b>Files</b>
       Upon startup, Tig first reads the system wide configuration file ({sysconfdir}/tigrc by default) and then
       proceeds to read the user’s configuration file (<a href="file:~/.tigrc">~/.tigrc</a> or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tig/config by default). The
       paths to either of these files can be overridden through the following environment variables:

       TIGRC_USER
           Path of the user configuration file.

       TIGRC_SYSTEM
           Path of the system wide configuration file.

   <b>History</b> <b>Files</b>
       If compiled with readline support, Tig writes a persistent command and search history to <a href="file:~/.tig_history">~/.tig_history</a>
       or $XDG_DATA_HOME/tig/history.

   <b>Repository</b> <b>References</b>
       Commits that are referenced by tags and branch heads will be marked by the reference name surrounded by <u>[</u>
       and <u>]</u>:

           2006-03-26 19:42 Petr Baudis         | [cogito-0.17.1] Cogito 0.17.1

       If you want to limit what branches are shown, say only show branches named master or those which start
       with the feature/ prefix, you can do it by setting the following variable:

           $ TIG_LS_REMOTE="git ls-remote . master feature/*" tig

       Or set the variable permanently in your environment.

       TIG_LS_REMOTE
           Command for retrieving all repository references. The command should output data in the same format
           as <a href="../man1/git-ls-remote.1.html">git-ls-remote</a>(1). Defaults to:

           git ls-remote .

   <b>Diff</b> <b>options</b>
       It is possible to alter how diffs are shown by the diff view. If for example you prefer to have commit
       and author dates shown as relative dates, use:

           $ TIG_DIFF_OPTS="--relative-date" tig

       Or set the variable permanently in your environment.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>KEYBINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Below the default key bindings are shown.

   <b>View</b> <b>Switching</b>
       <b>Key</b>   <b>Action</b>

       m     Switch to main view.

       d     Switch to diff view.

       l     Switch to log view.

       p     Switch to pager view.

       t     Switch to (directory) tree view.

       f     Switch to (file) blob view.

       g     Switch to grep view.

       b     Switch to blame view.

       r     Switch to refs view.

       y     Switch to stash view.

       h     Switch to help view

       s     Switch to status view

       c     Switch to stage view

   <b>View</b> <b>Manipulation</b>
       <b>Key</b>     <b>Action</b>

       q       Close view, if multiple views are
               open it will jump back to the
               previous view in the view stack. If
               it is the last open view it will
               quit. Use <u>Q</u> to quit all views at
               once.

       Enter   This key is "context sensitive"
               depending on what view you are
               currently in. When in log view on a
               commit line or in the main view,
               split the view and show the commit
               diff. In the diff view pressing Enter
               will simply scroll the view one line
               down.

       Tab     Switch to next view.

       R       Reload and refresh the current view.

       O       Maximize the current view to fill the
               whole display.

       Up      This key is "context sensitive" and
               will move the cursor one line up.
               However, if you opened a split view
               it will change the cursor to point to
               the previous commit in the parent
               view and update the child view to
               display it. If you prefer this key to
               move the cursor or scroll within the
               diff view instead, use bind diff &lt;Up&gt;
               move-up or bind diff &lt;Up&gt;
               scroll-line-up, respectively.

       Down    Similar to <u>Up</u> but will move down.

       ,       Move to parent. In the tree view,
               this means switch to the parent
               directory. In the blame view it will
               load blame for the parent commit. For
               merges the parent is queried.

   <b>View</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Actions</b>
       <b>Key</b>   <b>Action</b>

       u     Update status of file. In the status
             view, this allows you to add an
             untracked file or stage changes to a
             file for next commit (similar to
             running git-add &lt;filename&gt;). In the
             stage view, when pressing this on a
             diff chunk line stages only that
             chunk for next commit, when not on a
             diff chunk line all changes in the
             displayed diff are staged.

       M     Resolve unmerged file by launching
             <a href="../man1/git-mergetool.1.html">git-mergetool</a>(1). Note, to work
             correctly this might require some
             initial configuration of your
             preferred merge tool. See the manpage
             of <a href="../man1/git-mergetool.1.html">git-mergetool</a>(1).

       !     Checkout file with unstaged changes.
             This will reset the file to contain
             the content it had at last commit.

       1     Stage single diff line.

       @     Move to next chunk in the stage view.

       ]     Increase the diff context.

       [     Decrease the diff context.

   <b>Cursor</b> <b>Navigation</b>
       <b>Key</b>             <b>Action</b>

       k               Move cursor one line up.

       j               Move cursor one line down.

       PgUp, -         Move cursor one page up.

       PgDown, Space   Move cursor one page down.

       Home            Jump to first line.

       End             Jump to last line.

   <b>Scrolling</b>
       <b>Key</b>          <b>Action</b>

       Insert       Scroll view one line up.

       Delete       Scroll view one line down.

       ScrollBack   Scroll view one page up.

       ScrollFwd    Scroll view one page down.

       Left         Scroll view one column left.

       Right        Scroll view one column right.

       |            Scroll view to the first column.

   <b>Searching</b>
       <b>Key</b>   <b>Action</b>

       /     Search the view. Opens a prompt for
             entering search regexp to use.

       ?     Search backwards in the view. Also
             prompts for regexp.

       n     Find next match for the current
             search regexp.

       N     Find previous match for the current
             search regexp.

       The format for patterns is either POSIX.2 “extended” REs or PCRE / PCRE2 if Tig was compiled with PCRE /
       PCRE2 support (check with tig -v). See the manpage of <a href="../man7/re_format.7.html">re_format</a>(7) or <a href="../man3/pcrepattern.3.html">pcrepattern</a>(3) / <a href="../man3/pcre2pattern.3.html">pcre2pattern</a>(3).

       Case sensitivity can be controlled with variable ignore-case.

   <b>External</b> <b>Commands</b>
       For more custom needs, external commands provide a way to easily execute a script or program. They are
       bound to keys and use information from the current browsing state, such as the current commit ID. Tig
       comes with the following built-in external commands:
       <b>Keymap</b>    <b>Key</b>   <b>Action</b>

       main      C     git cherry-pick %(commit)

       status    C     git commit

       generic   G     git gc

</pre><h4><b>REVISION</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes various ways to specify what revisions to display or otherwise limit the view to.
       Tig does not itself parse the described revision options so refer to the relevant Git man pages for
       further information. Relevant man pages besides <a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a>(1) are <a href="../man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff</a>(1) and <a href="../man1/git-rev-list.1.html">git-rev-list</a>(1).

       You can tune the interaction with Git by making use of the options explained in this section. For
       example, by configuring the environment variable described in the section on diff options.

   <b>Limit</b> <b>by</b> <b>Path</b> <b>Name</b>
       If you are interested only in those revisions that made changes to a specific file (or even several
       files) list the files like this:

           $ tig Makefile README

       To avoid ambiguity with Tig’s subcommands or repository references such as tag names, be sure to separate
       file names from other Git options using "--". So if you have a file named <u>status</u> it will clash with the
       <u>status</u> subcommand, and thus you will have to use:

           $ tig -- status

   <b>Limit</b> <b>by</b> <b>Date</b> <b>or</b> <b>Number</b>
       To speed up interaction with Git, you can limit the amount of commits to show both for the log and main
       view. Either limit by date using e.g. --since=1.month or limit by the number of commits using -n400.

       If you are only interested in changes that happened between two dates you can use:

           $ tig --after="May 5th" --before="2006-05-16 15:44"

           <b>Note</b>

           If you want to avoid having to quote dates containing spaces you can use "." instead, e.g.
           --after=May.5th.

   <b>Limiting</b> <b>by</b> <b>Commit</b> <b>Ranges</b>
       Alternatively, commits can be limited to a specific range, such as "all commits between <u>tag-1.0</u> and
       <u>tag-2.0</u>". For example:

           $ tig tag-1.0..tag-2.0

       This way of commit limiting makes it trivial to only browse the commits which haven’t been pushed to a
       remote branch. Assuming <u>origin</u> is your upstream remote branch, using:

           $ tig origin..HEAD

       will list what will be pushed to the remote branch. Optionally, the ending <u>HEAD</u> can be left out since it
       is implied.

   <b>Limiting</b> <b>by</b> <b>Reachability</b>
       Git interprets the range specifier "tag-1.0..tag-2.0" as "all commits reachable from <u>tag-2.0</u> but not from
       <u>tag-1.0</u>". Where reachability refers to what commits are ancestors (or part of the history) of the branch
       or tagged revision in question.

       If you prefer to specify which commit to preview in this way use the following:

           $ tig tag-2.0 ^tag-1.0

       You can think of <u>^</u> as a negation operator. Using this alternate syntax, it is possible to further prune
       commits by specifying multiple branch cut offs.

   <b>Combining</b> <b>Revisions</b> <b>Specification</b>
       Revision options can to some degree be combined, which makes it possible to say "show at most 20 commits
       from within the last month that changed files under the Documentation/ directory."

           $ tig --since=1.month -n20 -- Documentation/

   <b>Examining</b> <b>All</b> <b>Repository</b> <b>References</b>
       In some cases, it can be useful to query changes across all references in a repository. An example is to
       ask "did any line of development in this repository change a particular file within the last week". This
       can be accomplished using:

           $ tig --all --since=1.week -- Makefile
