       cpack-generators - CPack Generator Reference

</pre><h4><b>GENERATORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CPack</b> <b>Archive</b> <b>Generator</b>
       CPack generator for packaging files into an archive, which can have any of the following formats:

          • 7Z - 7zip - (<b>.7z</b>)

          • TBZ2 (<b>.tar.bz2</b>)

          • TGZ (<b>.tar.gz</b>)

          • TXZ (<b>.tar.xz</b>)

          • TZ (<b>.tar.Z</b>)

          • TZST (<b>.tar.zst</b>)

          • ZIP (<b>.zip</b>)

       Added in version 3.1: 7Z and TXZ formats support.

       Added in version 3.16: TZST format support.

       When  this  generator is called from <b>CPackSourceConfig.cmake</b> (or through the <b>package_source</b> target), then
       the generated archive will contain all  files  in  the  project  directory,  except  those  specified  in
       <u>CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES</u>.  The following is one example of packaging all source files of a project:

          set(CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR "TGZ")
          set(CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES
            \\.git/
            build/
            ".*~$"
          )
          set(CPACK_VERBATIM_VARIABLES YES)
          include(CPack)

       When  this generator is called from <b>CPackConfig.cmake</b> (or through the <b>package</b> target), then the generated
       archive will contain all files that have been installed via CMake's <u>install()</u> command (and the deprecated
       commands <u>install_files()</u>, <u>install_programs()</u>, and <u>install_targets()</u>).

   <b>Variables</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> <b>CPack</b> <b>Archive</b> <b>generator</b>
       <b>CPACK_ARCHIVE_FILE_NAME</b>

       <b>CPACK_ARCHIVE_&lt;component&gt;_FILE_NAME</b>
              Package file name without extension.

              <b>Default</b>
                     The default is <b>&lt;CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME&gt;[-&lt;component&gt;]</b>, with spaces replaced by '-'.

              The extension is determined from the archive format (see list above) and automatically appended to
              the file name. Note that <b>&lt;component&gt;</b> is all uppercase in the variable name.

              Added in version 3.9: Per-component <b>CPACK_ARCHIVE_&lt;component&gt;_FILE_NAME</b> variables.

       <b>CPACK_ARCHIVE_FILE_EXTENSION</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              Package file extension.

              <b>Default</b>
                     Default values are given in the list above.

       <b>CPACK_ARCHIVE_COMPONENT_INSTALL</b>
              Enable component packaging.

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>OFF</b>

              If enabled (<b>ON</b>) multiple packages are generated. By default a single package containing  files  of
              all components is generated.

   <b>Variables</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>CPack</b> <b>Archive</b> <b>generator</b>
       These  variables  are used by the Archive generator, but are also available to CPack generators which are
       essentially archives at their core. These include:

       • <u>CPack</u> <u>Cygwin</u> <u>Generator</u>

       • <u>CPack</u> <u>FreeBSD</u> <u>Generator</u>

       <b>CPACK_ARCHIVE_THREADS</b>
              The number of threads to use when performing the compression.

              Added in version 3.18.

              <b>Default</b>
                     value of <u>CPACK_THREADS</u>

              If set to <b>0</b>, the number of available cores on the machine will be used instead.  Note that not all
              compression modes support threading in all environments.

              Added in version 3.21: Official CMake binaries available on <b>cmake.org</b> now ship with a <b>liblzma</b> that
              supports parallel compression.  Older versions did not.

   <b>CPack</b> <b>Bundle</b> <b>Generator</b>
       CPack Bundle generator (macOS) specific options

   <b>Variables</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> <b>CPack</b> <b>Bundle</b> <b>generator</b>
       Installers built on macOS using the Bundle generator use  the  aforementioned  DragNDrop  (<b>CPACK_DMG_xxx</b>)
       variables, plus the following Bundle-specific parameters (<b>CPACK_BUNDLE_xxx</b>).

       <b>CPACK_BUNDLE_NAME</b>
              The name of the generated bundle. This appears in the macOS Finder as the bundle name. Required.

       <b>CPACK_BUNDLE_PLIST</b>
              Path  to  an  macOS  Property  List (<b>.plist</b>) file that will be used for the generated bundle. This
              assumes that the caller has generated or specified their own <b>Info.plist</b> file. Required.

       <b>CPACK_BUNDLE_ICON</b>
              Path to an macOS icon file that will be used as the icon for the generated  bundle.  This  is  the
              icon  that  appears  in  the macOS Finder for the bundle, and in the macOS dock when the bundle is
              opened. Required.

       <b>CPACK_BUNDLE_STARTUP_COMMAND</b>
              Path to a startup script. This is a path to an executable or script that will be run  whenever  an
              end-user double-clicks the generated bundle in the macOS Finder. Optional.

       <b>CPACK_BUNDLE_APPLE_CERT_APP</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              The  name  of  your Apple supplied code signing certificate for the application.  The name usually
              takes the form <b>Developer</b> <b>ID</b> <b>Application:</b> <b>[Name]</b> or <b>3rd</b> <b>Party</b> <b>Mac</b> <b>Developer</b> <b>Application:</b> <b>[Name]</b>. If
              this variable is not set the application will not be signed.

       <b>CPACK_BUNDLE_APPLE_ENTITLEMENTS</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              The name of the Property List (<b>.plist</b>) file that contains your Apple entitlements  for  sandboxing
              your application. This file is required for submission to the macOS App Store.

       <b>CPACK_BUNDLE_APPLE_CODESIGN_FILES</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              A  list  of  additional  files  that  you  wish  to  be  signed.  You do not need to list the main
              application folder, or the main executable. You should list any frameworks and  plugins  that  are
              included in your app bundle.

       <b>CPACK_BUNDLE_APPLE_CODESIGN_PARAMETER</b>
              Added in version 3.3.

              Additional parameter that will passed to <b>codesign</b>.  Default value: <b>--deep</b> <b>-f</b>

       <b>CPACK_COMMAND_CODESIGN</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              Path to the <b><a href="../man1/codesign.1.html">codesign</a>(1)</b> command used to sign applications with an Apple cert. This variable can be
              used to override the automatically detected command (or specify its location if the auto-detection
              fails to find it).

   <b>CPack</b> <b>Cygwin</b> <b>Generator</b>
       Cygwin CPack generator (Cygwin).

   <b>Variables</b> <b>affecting</b> <b>the</b> <b>CPack</b> <b>Cygwin</b> <b>generator</b>
       • Added in version 3.18: <u>CPACK_ARCHIVE_THREADS</u>

   <b>Variables</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> <b>CPack</b> <b>Cygwin</b> <b>generator</b>
       The following variable is specific to installers build on and/or for Cygwin:

       <b>CPACK_CYGWIN_PATCH_NUMBER</b>
              The Cygwin patch number.  FIXME: This documentation is incomplete.

       <b>CPACK_CYGWIN_PATCH_FILE</b>
              The Cygwin patch file.  FIXME: This documentation is incomplete.

       <b>CPACK_CYGWIN_BUILD_SCRIPT</b>
              The Cygwin build script.  FIXME: This documentation is incomplete.

   <b>CPack</b> <b>DEB</b> <b>Generator</b>
       The built in (binary) CPack DEB generator (Unix only)

   <b>Variables</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> <b>CPack</b> <b>Debian</b> <b>(DEB)</b> <b>generator</b>
       The  CPack  DEB  generator  may  be used to create DEB package using <u>CPack</u>.  The CPack DEB generator is a
       <u>CPack</u> generator thus it uses the <b>CPACK_XXX</b> variables used by <u>CPack</u>.

       The CPack DEB generator should work on any Linux host but it will produce better deb package when  Debian
       specific tools <b>dpkg-xxx</b> are usable on the build system.

       The  CPack  DEB  generator  has  specific features which are controlled by the specifics <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_XXX</b>
       variables.

       <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_XXXX</b> variables may be used in order to have  <b>component</b>  specific  values.   Note
       however  that <b>&lt;COMPONENT&gt;</b> refers to the <b>grouping</b> <b>name</b> written in upper case. It may be either a component
       name or a component GROUP name.

       Here are some CPack DEB generator wiki resources that are here for historic reasons  and  are  no  longer
       maintained but may still prove useful:

          • <u>https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/cpack/Configuration</u>

          • <u>https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/cpack/PackageGenerators#deb-unix-only</u>

       List of CPack DEB generator specific variables:

       <b>CPACK_DEB_COMPONENT_INSTALL</b>
              Enable component packaging for CPackDEB

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>OFF</b>

              If  enabled  (<b>ON</b>) multiple packages are generated. By default a single package containing files of
              all components is generated.

       <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_NAME</b>

       <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_NAME</b>
              Set Package control field (variable is automatically transformed to lower case).

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>

                     • <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME</u> for non-component based installations

                     • <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_NAME</u> suffixed with <b>-&lt;COMPONENT&gt;</b> for component-based installations.

              Added in version 3.5: Per-component <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_NAME</b> variables.

              See <u>https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-source</u>

       <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_FILE_NAME</b>

       <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_FILE_NAME</b>
              Added in version 3.6.

              Package file name.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>&lt;CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME&gt;[-&lt;component&gt;].deb</b>

              This may be set to:

              <b>DEB-DEFAULT</b>
                     Tell CPack to automatically generate the package file name in deb format:

                        &lt;PackageName&gt;_&lt;VersionNumber&gt;-&lt;DebianRevisionNumber&gt;_&lt;DebianArchitecture&gt;.deb

                     This setting recommended as the preferred behavior, but for backward compatibility with the
                     CPack DEB generator in CMake prior to version 3.6, this is not the default.   Without this,
                     duplicate names may occur.  Duplicate files get overwritten and it is up to the packager to
                     set the variables in a manner that will prevent such errors.

              <b>&lt;file-name&gt;[.deb]</b>
                     Use the given file name.

                     Changed in version 3.29: The <b>.deb</b> suffix will be automatically added if the file name  does
                     not end in <b>.deb</b> or <b>.ipk</b>.  Previously the suffix was required.

              <b>&lt;file-name&gt;.ipk</b>
                     Added in version 3.10.

                     Use the given file name.  The <b>.ipk</b> suffix is used by the OPKG packaging system.

       <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_EPOCH</b>
              Added in version 3.10.

              The Debian package epoch

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>
                     None

              Optional  number that should be incremented when changing versioning schemas or fixing mistakes in
              the version numbers of older packages.

       <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_VERSION</b>
              The Debian package version

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION</u>

              This variable may contain only alphanumerics (A-Za-z0-9) and the characters . + -  ~  (full  stop,
              plus,  hyphen,  tilde)  and  should start with a digit. If <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_RELEASE</u> is not set
              then hyphens are not allowed.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 For backward compatibility with CMake 3.9 and lower a failed test of this variable's content is
                 not  a  hard  error  when  both  <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_RELEASE</u>  and   <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_EPOCH</u>
                 variables are not set. An author warning is reported instead.

       <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_RELEASE</b>
              Added in version 3.6.

              The Debian package release - Debian revision number.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>
                     None

              This  is  the  numbering  of the DEB package itself, i.e. the version of the packaging and not the
              version of the content (see <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_VERSION</u>). One may change the default value if the
              previous packaging was buggy and/or you want to put here a fancy Linux distro specific numbering.

       <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE</b>

       <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE</b>
              The Debian package architecture

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     Output of <b>dpkg</b> <b>--print-architecture</b> (or <b>i386</b> if <b>dpkg</b> is not found)

              Added in version 3.6: Per-component <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE</b> variables.

       <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DEPENDS</b>

       <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_DEPENDS</b>
              Sets the Debian dependencies of this package.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>

                     • An empty string for non-component based installations

                     • <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DEPENDS</u> for component-based installations.

              Added in version 3.3: Per-component <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_DEPENDS</b> variables.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If           <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS</u>           or           more            specifically
                 <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS</u>   is   set   for   this  component,  the  discovered
                 dependencies  will  be  appended   to   <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_DEPENDS</u>   instead   of
                 <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DEPENDS</u>.  If  <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_DEPENDS</u> is an empty string,
                 only the automatically discovered dependencies will be set for this component.

              Changed in version 3.31: The variable is always expanded as a list. Before it was expanded only if
              used  in   cooperation   with   <u>CPACK_DEB_COMPONENT_INSTALL</u>,   <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS</u>   or
              <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS</u>.   This  meant  that  if  a  component  had  no  shared
              libraries discovered (e.g. a package composed only of  scripts)  you  had  to  join  the  list  by
              yourself to obtain a valid Depends field.

              Example:

                 set(CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DEPENDS "libc6 (&gt;= 2.3.1-6), libc6 (&lt; 2.4)")
                 list(APPEND CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DEPENDS cmake)

       <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_ENABLE_COMPONENT_DEPENDS</b>
              Added in version 3.6.

              Sets inter-component dependencies if listed with <u>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DEPENDS</u> variables.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>
                     None

       <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_MAINTAINER</b>
              The Debian package maintainer

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_CONTACT</b>

       <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION</b>

       <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_DESCRIPTION</b>

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>

                     • <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_DESCRIPTION</u>   (component  based  installers  only)  if  set,  or
                       <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION</u> if set, or

                     • <u>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DESCRIPTION</u> (component  based  installers  only)  if  set,  or
                       <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION</u> if set, or

                     • content of the file specified in <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE</u> if set

              If  after  that description is not set, <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY</u> going to be used if set.
              Otherwise, <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY</u> will be added as the first  line  of  description  as
              defined in <u>Debian</u> <u>Policy</u> <u>Manual</u>.

              Added in version 3.3: Per-component <b>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DESCRIPTION</b> variables.

              Added in version 3.16: Per-component <b>CPACK_DEBIAN_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_DESCRIPTION</b> variables.

              Added in version 3.16: The <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE</b> variable.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This  is  a  stronger  restriction  than  <u>Breaks</u>,  which prevents the broken package from being
                 configured while the breaking package is in the "Unpacked" state but allows both packages to be
                 unpacked at the same time.

          <u>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</u> variable value.

          Additionally, if <u>CPACK_STRIP_FILES</u> is set, the files will be stripped  before  they  get  to  the  DEB
          generator,  so will not contain debug symbols and a dbgsym package will not get built. Do not use with
          <u>CPACK_STRIP_FILES</u>.

   <b>Building</b> <b>Debian</b> <b>packages</b> <b>on</b> <b>Windows</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       To communicate UNIX file permissions from the install stage to the CPack DEB generator  the  <b>cmake_mode_t</b>
       NTFS alternate data stream (ADT) is used.

       When a filesystem without ADT support is used only owner read/write permissions can be preserved.

   <b>Reproducible</b> <b>packages</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       The  environment  variable  <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b>  may  be  set to a UNIX timestamp, defined as the number of
       seconds, excluding leap seconds, since 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC.  If set, the CPack  DEB  generator  will
       use its value for timestamps in the package.

   <b>CPack</b> <b>DragNDrop</b> <b>Generator</b>
       The DragNDrop CPack generator (macOS) creates a DMG image.

   <b>Variables</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> <b>CPack</b> <b>DragNDrop</b> <b>generator</b>
       The following variables are specific to the DragNDrop installers built on macOS:

       <b>CPACK_DMG_VOLUME_NAME</b>
              The volume name of the generated disk image.

              <b>Default</b>
                     <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME</u>

       <b>CPACK_DMG_FORMAT</b>
              The disk image format.

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>UDZO</b>

              Common   values   are   <b>UDRO</b>   (UDIF   read-only),  <b>UDZO</b>  (UDIF  zlib-compressed)  or  <b>UDBZ</b>  (UDIF
              bzip2-compressed). Refer to <b><a href="../man1/hdiutil.1.html">hdiutil</a>(1)</b> for more information on other available formats.

       <b>CPACK_DMG_DS_STORE</b>
              Path to a custom <b>.DS_Store</b> file. This <b>.DS_Store</b> file can be used  to  specify  the  Finder  window
              position/geometry and layout (such as hidden toolbars, placement of the icons etc.). This file has
              to  be generated by the Finder (either manually or through AppleScript) using a normal folder from
              which the <b>.DS_Store</b> file can then be extracted.

       <b>CPACK_DMG_DS_STORE_SETUP_SCRIPT</b>
              Added in version 3.5.

              Path to a custom AppleScript file.  This AppleScript is used to generate a  <b>.DS_Store</b>  file  which
              specifies  the  Finder  window position/geometry and layout (such as hidden toolbars, placement of
              the icons etc.).  By specifying a custom AppleScript there is no need to  use  <b>CPACK_DMG_DS_STORE</b>,
              as the <b>.DS_Store</b> that is generated by the AppleScript will be packaged.

       <b>CPACK_DMG_BACKGROUND_IMAGE</b>

              <b>Default</b>

              Path   to   an  image  file  to  be  used  as  the  background.   This  file  will  be  copied  to
              <b>.background</b>/<b>background.&lt;ext&gt;</b>, where <b>&lt;ext&gt;</b> is the original image file  extension.   The  background
              image   is  installed  into  the  image  before  <b>CPACK_DMG_DS_STORE_SETUP_SCRIPT</b>  is  executed  or
              <b>CPACK_DMG_DS_STORE</b> is installed.  By default no background image is set.

       <b>CPACK_DMG_DISABLE_APPLICATIONS_SYMLINK</b>
              Added in version 3.6.

              Default behavior is to include a symlink to <b>/Applications</b> in the DMG.  Set this option  to  <b>ON</b>  to
              avoid adding the symlink.

       <b>CPACK_DMG_SLA_USE_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE</b>
              Added in version 3.23.

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>OFF</b>

              Control whether <u>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE</u>, if set to a non-default value, is used as the license
              agreement  provided when mounting the DMG.  If <b>CPACK_DMG_SLA_USE_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE</b> is not set,
              <u><a href="../man1/cpack.1.html">cpack</a>(1)</u> defaults to off.

              In   a   CMake   project   that   uses   the   <u>CPack</u>   module   to   generate   <b>CPackConfig.cmake</b>,
              <b>CPACK_DMG_SLA_USE_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE</b>  must be explicitly enabled by the project to activate the
              SLA.  See policy <u>CMP0133</u>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This option was added in response to macOS 12.0's deprecation of the <b>hdiutil</b> <b>udifrez</b> command to
                 make its use optional.  CPack 3.22 and below always use <u>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE</u>, if set  to
                 a non-default value, as the DMG license.

       <b>CPACK_DMG_SLA_DIR</b>
              Added in version 3.5.

              Directory  where  license  and menu files for different languages are stored.  Setting this causes
              CPack to look for a <b>&lt;language&gt;.menu.txt</b> and <b>&lt;language&gt;.license.txt</b> or <b>&lt;language&gt;.license.rtf</b>  file
              for   every   language   defined   in   <u>CPACK_DMG_SLA_LANGUAGES</u>.    If   both  this  variable  and
              <u>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE</u> are set, CPack will only look for the menu  files  and  use  the  same
              license  file for all languages.  If both <b>&lt;language&gt;.license.txt</b> and <b>&lt;language&gt;.license.rtf</b> exist,
              the <b>.txt</b> file will be used.

              Added in version 3.17: RTF support.

       <b>CPACK_DMG_SLA_LANGUAGES</b>
              Added in version 3.5.

              Languages for which a license agreement is provided when mounting the generated DMG. A  menu  file
              consists  of  9 lines of text. The first line is is the name of the language itself, uppercase, in
              English (e.g. German).  The other lines are translations of the following strings:

              • Agree

              • Disagree

              • Print

              • Save...

              • You agree to the terms of the License Agreement when you click the "Agree" button.

              • Software License Agreement

              • This text cannot be saved. The disk may be full or locked, or the file may be locked.

              • Unable to print. Make sure you have selected a printer.

              For  every  language  in  this  list,  CPack  will  try  to  find  files  <b>&lt;language&gt;.menu.txt</b>  and
              <b>&lt;language&gt;.license.txt</b> in the directory specified by the <u>CPACK_DMG_SLA_DIR</u> variable.

       <b>CPACK_DMG_&lt;component&gt;_FILE_NAME</b>
              Added in version 3.17.

              File name when packaging <b>&lt;component&gt;</b> as its own DMG (<u>CPACK_COMPONENTS_GROUPING</u> set to <b>IGNORE</b>).

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME-&lt;component&gt;</b>

       <b>CPACK_DMG_FILESYSTEM</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>HFS+</b>

              The  filesystem  format.  Common  values  are  <b>APFS</b>  and <b>HFS+</b>.  See <b>man</b> <b>hdiutil</b> for a full list of
              supported formats.

       <b>CPACK_COMMAND_HDIUTIL</b>
              Path to the <b><a href="../man1/hdiutil.1.html">hdiutil</a>(1)</b> command used to operate on disk image files on macOS. This variable can  be
              used to override the automatically detected command (or specify its location if the auto-detection
              fails to find it).

       <b>CPACK_COMMAND_SETFILE</b>
              Path  to the <b><a href="../man1/SetFile.1.html">SetFile</a>(1)</b> command used to set extended attributes on files and directories on macOS.
              This variable can be used to override the automatically detected command (or specify its  location
              if the auto-detection fails to find it).

       <b>CPACK_COMMAND_REZ</b>
              Path  to  the  <b><a href="../man1/Rez.1.html">Rez</a>(1)</b>  command  used  to  compile resources on macOS. This variable can be used to
              override the automatically detected command (or specify its location if the  auto-detection  fails
              to find it).

   <b>CPack</b> <b>External</b> <b>Generator</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       CPack  provides  many generators to create packages for a variety of platforms and packaging systems. The
       intention is for CMake/CPack to be a complete end-to-end solution for building and packaging  a  software
       project.  However,  it  may  not always be possible to use CPack for the entire packaging process, due to
       either technical limitations or policies that require the use of certain tools. For  this  reason,  CPack
       provides  the "External" generator, which allows external packaging software to take advantage of some of
       the functionality provided by CPack, such as component installation and the dependency graph.

   <b>Integration</b> <b>with</b> <b>External</b> <b>Packaging</b> <b>Tools</b>
       The CPack External generator generates a <b>.json</b> file containing the CPack internal metadata,  which  gives
       external  software  information  on  how  to package the software. External packaging software may itself
       invoke CPack, consume the generated metadata, install and package files as required.

       Alternatively CPack can invoke an external packaging software through an optional custom CMake script  in
       <u>CPACK_EXTERNAL_PACKAGE_SCRIPT</u> instead.

       Staging  of installation files may also optionally be taken care of by the generator when enabled through
       the <u>CPACK_EXTERNAL_ENABLE_STAGING</u> variable.

   <b>JSON</b> <b>Format</b>
       The JSON metadata file contains a list of CPack components and  component  groups,  the  various  options
       passed  to <u>cpack_add_component()</u> and <u>cpack_add_component_group()</u>, the dependencies between the components
       and component groups, and various other options passed to CPack.

       The JSON's root object will always provide two fields: <b>formatVersionMajor</b> and  <b>formatVersionMinor</b>,  which
       are always integers that describe the output format of the generator. Backwards-compatible changes to the
       output  format  (for  example, adding a new field that didn't exist before) cause the minor version to be
       incremented, and backwards-incompatible changes (for example, deleting a field or changing  its  meaning)
       cause  the major version to be incremented and the minor version reset to 0. The format version is always
       of the format <b>major.minor</b>. In other words, it always has exactly two parts, separated by a period.

       You  can  request  one  or  more  specific  versions  of  the  output  format  as  described  below  with
       <u>CPACK_EXTERNAL_REQUESTED_VERSIONS</u>.  The  output format will have a major version that exactly matches the
       requested major version, and a minor version that is  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  requested  minor
       version.  If  no  version  is  requested  with  <u>CPACK_EXTERNAL_REQUESTED_VERSIONS</u>, the latest known major
       version is used by default. Currently, the only supported format is 1.0, which is described below.

   <b>Version</b> <b>1.0</b>
       In addition to the standard format fields, format version 1.0 provides the following fields in the root:

       <b>components</b>
              The <b>components</b> field is an object with component names as the  keys  and  objects  describing  the
              components as the values. The component objects have the following fields:

                     The   name   of   the   archive   file   passed   with   the   <b>ARCHIVE_FILE</b>   argument   to
                     <u>cpack_add_component()</u>. If no <b>ARCHIVE_FILE</b> argument was passed, this is an empty string.

       <b>componentGroups</b>
              The  <b>componentGroups</b>  field  is  an  object  with  component  group  names as the keys and objects
              describing the component groups as the values. The component  group  objects  have  the  following
              fields:

              <b>name</b>   The  name of the component group. This is always the same as the key in the <b>componentGroups</b>
                     object.

              <b>displayName</b>
                     The value of the <b>DISPLAY_NAME</b> field passed to <u>cpack_add_component_group()</u>.

              <b>description</b>
                     The value of the <b>DESCRIPTION</b> field passed to <u>cpack_add_component_group()</u>.

              <b>parentGroup</b>
                     Only present if <b>PARENT_GROUP</b> was passed to <u>cpack_add_component_group()</u>. If so,  this  field
                     is a string value containing the component group's parent group.

              <b>isExpandedByDefault</b>
                     True if <b>EXPANDED</b> was passed to <u>cpack_add_component_group()</u>, false if it was not.

              <b>isBold</b> True if <b>BOLD_TITLE</b> was passed to <u>cpack_add_component_group()</u>, false if it was not.

              <b>components</b>

                     this group as their <b>GROUP</b>). Components of subgroups are not included.

              <b>subgroups</b>
                     An array of names of component groups that are subgroups of the  group  (groups  that  have
                     this group as their <b>PARENT_GROUP</b>).

       <b>installationTypes</b>
              The  <b>installationTypes</b>  field  is  an  object with installation type names as the keys and objects
              describing the installation types as the values. The installation type objects have the  following
              fields:

              <b>name</b>   The  name  of  the  installation  type.  This  is  always  the  same  as  the  key  in  the
                     <b>installationTypes</b> object.

              <b>displayName</b>
                     The value of the <b>DISPLAY_NAME</b> field passed to <u>cpack_add_install_type()</u>.

   <b>Variables</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> <b>CPack</b> <b>External</b> <b>generator</b>
       <b>CPACK_EXTERNAL_REQUESTED_VERSIONS</b>
              This variable is used to request a specific version of the CPack External generator. It is a  list
              of <b>major.minor</b> values, separated by semicolons.

              If  this  variable  is set to a non-empty value, the CPack External generator will iterate through
              each item in the list to search for a version that it knows how to  generate.  Requested  versions
              should  be  listed in order of descending preference by the client software, as the first matching
              version in the list will be generated.

              The generator knows how to generate the version if  it  has  a  versioned  generator  whose  major
              version  exactly  matches  the requested major version, and whose minor version is greater than or
              equal to the requested minor version. For example, if  <b>CPACK_EXTERNAL_REQUESTED_VERSIONS</b>  contains
              1.0,  and  the  CPack  External generator knows how to generate 1.1, it will generate 1.1.  If the
              generator doesn't know how to generate a version in the list, it skips the version  and  looks  at
              the  next  one.  If  it  doesn't  know  how to generate any of the requested versions, an error is
              thrown.

              If this variable is not set, or is empty, the CPack External generator will generate  the  highest
              major and minor version that it knows how to generate.

              If  an invalid version is encountered in <b>CPACK_EXTERNAL_REQUESTED_VERSIONS</b> (one that doesn't match
              <b>major.minor</b>, where <b>major</b> and <b>minor</b> are integers), it is ignored.

       <b>CPACK_EXTERNAL_ENABLE_STAGING</b>
              This variable can be set to true to enable optional installation into  a  temporary  staging  area
              which  can  then be picked up and packaged by an external packaging tool.  The top level directory
              used by CPack for the current packaging task is  contained  in  <b>CPACK_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY</b>.   It  is
              automatically  cleaned  up  on  each  run before packaging is initiated and can be used for custom
              temporary files required by the external packaging  tool.   It  also  contains  the  staging  area
              <b>CPACK_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY</b> into which CPack performs the installation when staging is enabled.

       <b>CPACK_EXTERNAL_PACKAGE_SCRIPT</b>
              This variable can optionally specify the full path to a CMake script file to be run as part of the
              CPack  invocation.   It  is  invoked  after  (optional) staging took place and may run an external
              packaging tool. The script has access to the variables defined by the CPack config file.

       <b>CPACK_EXTERNAL_BUILT_PACKAGES</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              The <b>CPACK_EXTERNAL_PACKAGE_SCRIPT</b> script may set this list variable to the full paths of generated
              package files.  CPack will copy these files from the staging  directory  back  to  the  top  build
              directory and possibly produce checksum files if the <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_CHECKSUM</u> is set.

   <b>CPack</b> <b>FreeBSD</b> <b>Generator</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       The built in (binary) CPack FreeBSD (pkg) generator (Unix only)

   <b>Variables</b> <b>affecting</b> <b>the</b> <b>CPack</b> <b>FreeBSD</b> <b>(pkg)</b> <b>generator</b>
       • Added in version 3.18: <u>CPACK_ARCHIVE_THREADS</u>

   <b>Variables</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> <b>CPack</b> <b>FreeBSD</b> <b>(pkg)</b> <b>generator</b>
       The  CPack  FreeBSD  generator  may  be  used  to create <a href="../man8/pkg.8.html">pkg</a>(8) packages -- these may be used on FreeBSD,
       DragonflyBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, but also on Linux or OSX, depending on  the  installed  package-management
       tools -- using <u>CPack</u>.

       The CPack FreeBSD generator is a <u>CPack</u> generator and uses the <b>CPACK_XXX</b> variables used by <u>CPack</u>. It tries
       to  reuse  packaging  information  that  may  already  be specified for Debian packages for the <u>CPack</u> <u>DEB</u>
       <u>Generator</u>. It also tries to reuse RPM packaging information when Debian does not specify.

       The CPack FreeBSD generator should work on any host with libpkg installed. The packages it  produces  are
       specific to the host architecture and ABI.

       The  CPack FreeBSD generator sets package-metadata through <b>CPACK_FREEBSD_XXX</b> variables. The CPack FreeBSD
       generator, unlike the CPack Deb generator, does not specially support componentized  packages;  a  single
       package is created from all the software artifacts created through CMake.

       All  of  the  variables  can  be  set  specifically  for  FreeBSD packaging in the CPackConfig file or in
       CMakeLists.txt, but most of them have defaults that use general  settings  (e.g.  <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME</u>)  or
       Debian-specific  variables  when  those  make  sense (e.g. the homepage of an upstream project is usually
       unchanged by the flavor of packaging). When there is no Debian information to fall back on, but  the  RPM
       packaging has it, fall back to the RPM information (e.g. package license).

       <b>CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_NAME</b>
              Sets the package name (in the package manifest, but also affects the output filename).

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>

                     • <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME</u> (this is always set by CPack itself, based on CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME).

       <b>CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_COMMENT</b>
              Sets the package comment. This is the short description displayed by <a href="../man8/pkg.8.html">pkg</a>(8) in standard "pkg info"
              output.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>

                     • <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY</u>  (this  is  always set by CPack itself, if nothing else
                       sets it explicitly).

       <b>CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION</b>
              Sets the package description. This is the long description of the package,  given  by  "pkg  info"
              with a specific package as argument.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>

                     • <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION</u>  (this may be set already for Debian packaging, so it is
                       used as a fallback).

                     • <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY</u> (this is always set by CPack itself,  if  nothing  else
                       sets it explicitly).

                     • <u>PROJECT_DESCRIPTION</u> (this can be set with the <b>DESCRIPTION</b> parameter for <u>project()</u>).

       <b>CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_WWW</b>
              The  URL  of  the  web site for this package, preferably (when applicable) the site from which the
              original source can be obtained and any additional upstream documentation or  information  may  be
              found.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>

                     • <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_HOMEPAGE_URL</u>, or if that is not set,

                     • <u>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_HOMEPAGE</u>  (this  may  be  set already for Debian packaging, so it is
                       used as a fallback).

              Added in version 3.12: The <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_HOMEPAGE_URL</b> variable.

       <b>CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_LICENSE</b>
              The license, or licenses, which apply  to  this  software  package.  This  must  be  one  or  more
              license-identifiers that pkg recognizes as acceptable license identifiers (e.g. "GPLv2").

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>

                     • <u>CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_LICENSE</u>

       <b>CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_LICENSE_LOGIC</b>
              This  variable  is only of importance if there is more than one license.  The default is "single",
              which is only applicable to a single license.  Other acceptable values are determined  by  pkg  --
              those  are  "dual"  or  "multi"  --  meaning  choice (OR) or simultaneous (AND) application of the
              licenses.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>
                     single

       <b>CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_MAINTAINER</b>
              The FreeBSD maintainer (e.g. <b><a href="mailto:kde@freebsd.org">kde@freebsd.org</a></b>) of this package.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     none

       <b>CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_ORIGIN</b>
              The origin (ports label) of this package; for packages built by CPack outside of the ports  system
              this is of less importance. The default puts the package somewhere under <b>misc/</b>, as a stopgap.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>misc/&lt;package</b> <b>name&gt;</b>

       <b>CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_CATEGORIES</b>
              The  ports categories where this package lives (if it were to be built from ports). If none is set
              a single category is determined based on the package origin.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     derived from <b>ORIGIN</b>

       <b>CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_DEPS</b>
              A list of package origins that should be added as package dependencies.  These  are  in  the  form
              <b>&lt;category&gt;/&lt;packagename&gt;</b>,  e.g. <b>x11/libkonq</b>.  No version information needs to be provided (this is
              not included in the manifest).

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>
                     empty

   <b>CPack</b> <b>Inno</b> <b>Setup</b> <b>Generator</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       Inno  Setup  is  a  free  installer  for  Windows  programs  by  Jordan  Russell  and  Martijn  Laan   (‐
       <u>https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php</u>).

       This documentation explains Inno Setup generator specific options.

       The  generator provides a lot of options like components. Unfortunately, not all features (e.g. component
       dependencies) are currently supported by Inno Setup and they're ignored by the generator for now.

       CPack requires Inno Setup 6 or greater.

       Added in version 3.30: The generator is now available on non-Windows hosts, but requires Wine to run  the
       Inno Setup tools.

   <b>Variables</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> <b>CPack</b> <b>Inno</b> <b>Setup</b> <b>generator</b>
       You can use the following variables to change the behavior of the CPack <b>INNOSETUP</b> generator:

   <b>General</b>
       None of the following variables is required to be set for the Inno Setup generator to work. If a variable
       is marked as mandatory below but not set, its default value is taken.

       The variables can also contain Inno Setup constants like <b>{app}</b>. Please refer to the documentation of Inno
       Setup for more information.

       If  you're  asked  to provide the path to any file, you can always give an absolute path or in most cases
       the relative path from  the  top-level  directory  where  all  files  being  installed  by  an  <u>install()</u>
       instruction reside.

       CPack  tries  to  escape  quotes  and other special characters for you. However, using special characters
       could cause problems.

       The following variable simplifies the usage of Inno Setup in CMake:

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_USE_CMAKE_BOOL_FORMAT</b>
              Inno Setup only uses <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> as boolean formats  meanwhile  CMake  uses  a  lot  of  alternative
              formats like <b>ON</b> or <b>OFF</b>. Having this option turned on enables an automatic conversion.

              Consider the following example:

                 set(CMAKE_INNOSETUP_SETUP_AllowNoIcons OFF)

              If  this  option  is  turned  on,  the  following  line  will  be  created  in  the output script:
              <b>AllowNoIcons=no</b>.  Else, the following erroneous line will be created: <b>AllowNoIcons=OFF</b>

              The conversion is enabled in every Inno Setup specific variable.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>ON</b>

   <b>Setup</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Variables</b>
       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_ARCHITECTURE</b>
              One of <b>x86</b>, <b>x64</b>, <b>arm64</b> or <b>ia64</b>. This variable specifies the target architecture of the  installer.
              This also affects the Program Files folder or registry keys being used.

              CPack  tries to determine the correct value with a try compile (see <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u>), but this
              option can be manually specified too (especially when using <b>ia64</b> or cross-platform compilation).

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     Either <b>x86</b> or <b>x64</b> depending on the results of the try-compile

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_INSTALL_ROOT</b>
              If you don't want the installer to create the installation directory under Program  Files,  you've
              to specify the installation root here.

              The         full         directory        of        the        installation        will        be:
              <b>${CPACK_INNOSETUP_INSTALL_ROOT}/${CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY}</b>.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>{autopf}</b>

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_ALLOW_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY</b>
              If turned on, the installer allows the user to change  the  installation  directory  providing  an
              extra wizard page.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>ON</b>

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_PROGRAM_MENU_FOLDER</b>
              The initial name of the start menu folder being created.

              If  this  variable  is  set  to  <b>.</b>, then no separate folder is created, application shortcuts will
              appear in the top-level start menu folder.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     The value of <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME</u>

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_LANGUAGES</b>
              A <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of languages you want Inno Setup to include.

              Currently available: <b>armenian</b>, <b>brazilianPortuguese</b>, <b>bulgarian</b>, <b>catalan</b>, <b>corsican</b>,  <b>czech</b>,  <b>danish</b>,
              <b>dutch</b>,  <b>english</b>, <b>finnish</b>, <b>french</b>, <b>german</b>, <b>hebrew</b>, <b>icelandic</b>, <b>italian</b>, <b>japanese</b>, <b>norwegian</b>, <b>polish</b>,
              <b>portuguese</b>, <b>russian</b>, <b>slovak</b>, <b>slovenian</b>, <b>spanish</b>, <b>turkish</b> and <b>ukrainian</b>.  This  list  might  differ
              depending on the version of Inno Setup.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>english</b>

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_IGNORE_LICENSE_PAGE</b>
              If  you  don't  specify  a  license  file using <u>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE</u>, CPack uses a file for
              demonstration purposes. If you want the installer to ignore license files at all, you  can  enable
              this option.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>OFF</b>

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_IGNORE_README_PAGE</b>
              If  you  don't  specify  a  readme  file  using  <u>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README</u>, CPack uses a file for
              demonstration purposes. If you want the installer to ignore readme files at all,  you  can  enable
              this option. Make sure the option is disabled when using a custom readme file.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>ON</b>

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_PASSWORD</b>
              Enables password protection and file encryption with the given password.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_USE_MODERN_WIZARD</b>
              Enables the modern look and feel provided by Inno Setup. If this option is turned off, the classic
              style is used instead. Images and icon files are also affected.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>OFF</b> because of compatibility reasons

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_ICON_FILE</b>
              The path to a custom installer <b>.ico</b> file.

              Use <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON</u> to customize the bitmap file being shown in the wizard.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_SETUP_&lt;directive&gt;</b>
              This  group  allows  adapting  any  of the <b>[Setup]</b> section directives provided by Inno Setup where
              <b>directive</b> is its name.

              Here are some examples:

                 set(CPACK_INNOSETUP_SETUP_WizardSmallImageFile "my_bitmap.bmp")
                 set(CPACK_INNOSETUP_SETUP_AllowNoIcons OFF) # This requires CPACK_INNOSETUP_USE_CMAKE_BOOL_FORMAT to be on

              All of these variables have higher priority than the others.  Consider the following example:

                 set(CPACK_INNOSETUP_SETUP_Password "admin")
                 set(CPACK_INNOSETUP_PASSWORD "secret")

              The password will be <b>admin</b> at the end because  <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_PASSWORD</b>  has  less  priority  than
              <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_SETUP_Password</b>.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

   <b>File</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Variables</b>
       Although  all  files being installed by an <u>install()</u> instruction are automatically processed and added to
       the installer, there are some variables to customize the installation process.

       Before using executables (only <b>.exe</b> or <b>.com</b>) in  shortcuts  (e.g.  <u>CPACK_CREATE_DESKTOP_LINKS</u>)  or  <b>[Run]</b>
       entries,  you've  to  add the raw file name (without path and extension) to <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES</u> and
       create a start menu shortcut for them.

       If you have two files with the same raw name (e.g. <b>a/executable.exe</b> and <b>b/executable.com</b>),  an  entry  in
       the section is created twice. This will result in undefined behavior and is not recommended.

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_CUSTOM_INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS</b>
              This variable should contain a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of pairs <b>path</b>, <b>instruction</b> and can be used
              to customize the install command being automatically created for each file or directory.

              CPack creates the following Inno Setup instruction for every file...

                 Source: "absolute\path\to\my_file.txt"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: ignoreversion

              ...and the following line for every directory:

                 Name: "{app}\my_folder"

              You  might want to change the destination directory or the flags of <b>my_file.txt</b>. Since we can also
              provide a relative path, the line you'd like to have, is the following:

                 Source: "my_file.txt"; DestDir: "{userdocs}"; Flags: ignoreversion uninsneveruninstall

              You would do this by using <b>my_file.txt</b> as <b>path</b> and <b>Source:</b> <b>"my_file.txt";</b>  <b>DestDir:</b>  <b>"{userdocs}";</b>
              <b>Flags:</b> <b>ignoreversion</b> <b>uninsneveruninstall</b> as <b>instruction</b>.

              You've to take care of the <u>escaping</u> <u>problem</u>.  So the CMake command would be:

                 set(CPACK_INNOSETUP_CUSTOM_INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS "my_file.txt;Source: \\\"my_file.txt\\\"\\; DestDir: \\\"{userdocs}\\\"\\; Flags: ignoreversion uninsneveruninstall")

              To    improve    readability,   you   should   go   around   the   escaping   problem   by   using
              <u>CPACK_VERBATIM_VARIABLES</u> or by placing the instruction into a separate CPack project config file.

              If you customize the install instruction of a specific  file,  you  lose  the  connection  to  its
              component.  To go around, manually add <b>Components:</b> <b>&lt;component&gt;</b>. You also need to add its shortcuts
              and <b>[Run]</b> entries by yourself in a custom section, since the executable won't be found anymore  by
              <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES</u>.

              Here's another example (Note: You've to go around the escaping problem for the example to work):

                 set(CPACK_INNOSETUP_CUSTOM_INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS
                     "component1/my_folder" "Name: \"{userdocs}\\my_folder\"\; Components: component1"
                     "component2/my_folder2/my_file.txt" "Source: \"component2\\my_folder2\\my_file.txt\"\; DestDir: \"{app}\\my_folder2\\my_file.txt\"\; Flags: ignoreversion uninsneveruninstall\; Components: component2")

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_MENU_LINKS</b>
              This  variable  should contain a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of pairs <b>link</b>, <b>link</b> <b>name</b> and can be used
              to  add  shortcuts  into  the  start  menu  folder  beside   those   of   the   executables   (see
              <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES</u>).  While <b>link</b> <b>name</b> is the label, <b>link</b> can be a URL or a path relative to
              the installation directory.

              Here's an example:

                 set(CPACK_INNOSETUP_MENU_LINKS
                     "doc/cmake-@CMake_VERSION_MAJOR@.@CMake_VERSION_MINOR@/cmake.html"
                     "CMake Help" "https://cmake.org" "CMake Web Site")

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_CREATE_UNINSTALL_LINK</b>
              If this option is turned on, a shortcut to the application's uninstaller is automatically added to
              the start menu folder.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>OFF</b>

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_RUN_EXECUTABLES</b>
              A  <u>semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u> of executables being specified in <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES</u> which the
              user can run when the installer finishes.

              They're internally added to the <b>[Run]</b> section.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

   <b>Components</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Variables</b>
       The generator supports components and also downloaded components. However, there  are  some  features  of
       components that aren't supported yet (especially component dependencies). These variables are ignored for
       now.

       CPack  will  change  a  component's  name  in  Inno Setup if it has a parent group for technical reasons.
       Consider using <b>group\component</b> as component name  in  Inno  Setup  scripts  if  you  have  the  component
       <b>component</b> and its parent group <b>group</b>.

       Here are some additional variables for components:

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_&lt;compName&gt;_INSTALL_DIRECTORY</b>
              If  you  don't  want  the  component  <b>compName</b>  to be installed under <b>{app}</b>, you've to specify its
              installation directory here.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_VERIFY_DOWNLOADS</b>
              This option only affects downloaded components.

              If this option is turned on, the hashes of the downloaded archives are calculated  during  compile
              and download time. The installer will only proceed if they match.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>ON</b>

   <b>Compilation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Scripting</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Variables</b>
       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_EXECUTABLE</b>
              The filename of the Inno Setup Script Compiler command.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>ISCC</b>

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_EXECUTABLE_ARGUMENTS</b>
              A  <u>semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  of  extra  command-line  options  for the Inno Setup Script Compiler
              command.

              For example: <b>/Qp;/Smysigntool=$p</b>

              Take care of the <u>escaping</u> <u>problem</u>.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_DEFINE_&lt;macro&gt;</b>
              This group allows to add custom define directives  as  command-line  options  to  the  Inno  Setup
              Preprocessor  command.  Each  entry  emulates  a  <b>#define</b>  <b>public</b>  <b>&lt;macro&gt;</b> directive. Its macro is
              accessible from anywhere (<b>public</b>), so it can also be used in extra script files.

              Macro names must not contain  any  special  characters.  Refer  to  the  Inno  Setup  Preprocessor
              documentation for the detailed rules.

              Consider the following example:

                 # The following line emulates: #define public MyMacro "Hello, World!"
                 set(CPACK_INNOSETUP_DEFINE_MyMacro "Hello, World!")

              At this point, you can use <b>MyMacro</b> anywhere. For example in the following extra script:

                 AppComments={#emit "'My Macro' has the value: " + MyMacro}

              Take care of the <u>escaping</u> <u>problem</u>.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_EXTRA_SCRIPTS</b>
              A <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of paths to additional <b>.iss</b> script files to be processed.

              They're internally included at the top of the output script file using a <b>#include</b> directive.

              You  can  add  any  section  in your file to extend the installer (e.g. adding additional tasks or
              registry keys). Prefer using <u>CPACK_INNOSETUP_SETUP_&lt;directive&gt;</u> when extending the <b>[Setup]</b> section.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

       <b>CPACK_INNOSETUP_CODE_FILES</b>
              A <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of paths to additional Pascal files to be processed.

              This variable is actually the same as <u>CPACK_INNOSETUP_EXTRA_SCRIPTS</u>, except you don't have to  add
              <b>[Code]</b>  at the top of your file. Never change the current section in a code file. This will result
              in undefined behavior! Treat them as normal Pascal scripts instead.

              Code files are included at the very bottom of the output script.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

   <b>CPack</b> <b>IFW</b> <b>Generator</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Configure and run the Qt Installer Framework to generate a Qt installer.

   <b>Overview</b>
       This <u>cpack</u> <u>generator</u> generates configuration and meta information for the <u>Qt</u> <u>Installer</u> <u>Framework</u> (QtIFW),
       and runs QtIFW tools to generate a Qt installer.

       QtIFW provides tools and utilities to create  installers  for  the  platforms  supported  by  <u>Qt</u>:  Linux,
       Microsoft Windows, and macOS.

       To  make  use of this generator, QtIFW needs to be installed.  The <u>CPackIFW</u> module looks for the location
       of the QtIFW command-line utilities, and defines  several  commands  to  control  the  behavior  of  this
       generator. See <u>Hints</u> <u>for</u> <u>Finding</u> <u>QtIFW</u>.

   <b>Variables</b>
       You can use the following variables to change the behavior of the CPack <b>IFW</b> generator.

              Added in version 3.23.

              Set  the  format  used when packaging new component data archives. If you omit this option, the <b>7z</b>
              format will be used as a default. Supported formats:

              • 7z

              • zip

              • tar.gz

              • tar.bz2

                 • 9 (<u>Ultra</u> <u>compression</u>)

              If this variable is not set, QtIFW will use a default compression level, which will typically be 5
              (<u>Normal</u> <u>compression</u>).

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Some  formats do not support all the possible values. For example <b>zip</b> compression only supports
                 values from 1 to 7.

              This feature is available for QtIFW 4.2.0 and later.

              Additional prepared repository directories that will be  used  to  resolve  and  repack  dependent
              components.

              This feature is available for QtIFW 3.1 and later.

   <b>QtIFW</b> <b>Tools</b>
       <b>CPACK_IFW_FRAMEWORK_VERSION</b>
              Added in version 3.3.

              The version of the QtIFW tools that will be used. This variable is set by the <u>CPackIFW</u> module.

       The  following  variables  provide  the  locations  of  the QtIFW command-line tools as discovered by the
       <u>CPackIFW</u> module.  These variables are cached, and may be configured if needed.

       <b>CPACK_IFW_ARCHIVEGEN_EXECUTABLE</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              The path to <b>archivegen</b>.

       <b>CPACK_IFW_BINARYCREATOR_EXECUTABLE</b>
              The path to <b>binarycreator</b>.

       <b>CPACK_IFW_REPOGEN_EXECUTABLE</b>
              The path to <b>repogen</b>.

       <b>CPACK_IFW_INSTALLERBASE_EXECUTABLE</b>
              The path to <b>installerbase</b>.

       <b>CPACK_IFW_DEVTOOL_EXECUTABLE</b>
              The path to <b>devtool</b>.

   <b>Hints</b> <b>for</b> <b>Finding</b> <b>QtIFW</b>
       Generally, the CPack <b>IFW</b>  generator  automatically  finds  QtIFW  tools.   The  following  (in  order  of
       precedence) can also be set to augment the locations normally searched by <u>find_program()</u>:

       <b>CPACK_IFW_ROOT</b>
              Added in version 3.9.

              CMake variable

       <b>CPACK_IFW_ROOT</b>
              Added in version 3.9.

              Environment variable

       <b>QTIFWDIR</b>
              CMake variable

       <b>QTIFWDIR</b>
              Environment variable

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The specified path should not contain <b>bin</b> at the end (for example: <b>D:\\DevTools\\QtIFW2.0.5</b>).

   <b>Other</b> <b>Settings</b>
   <b>Online</b> <b>installer</b>
       By  default,  this generator generates an <u>offline</u> <u>installer</u>. This means that all packaged files are fully
       contained in the installer executable.

       In contrast, an <u>online</u> <u>installer</u> will download some or all components from a remote server.

       The <b>DOWNLOADED</b> option  in  the  <u>cpack_add_component()</u>  command  specifies  that  a  component  is  to  be
       downloaded.  Alternatively,  the <b>ALL</b> option in the <u>cpack_configure_downloads()</u> command specifies that <u>all</u>
       components are to be be downloaded.

       The <u>cpack_ifw_add_repository()</u> command and the <u>CPACK_IFW_DOWNLOAD_ALL</u> variable allow  for  more  specific
       configuration.

       When  there  are  online  components,  CPack  will  write  them  to  archive files.  The help page of the
       <u>CPackComponent</u> module, especially the section on the <u>cpack_configure_downloads()</u> function,  explains  how
       to make these files accessible from a download URL.

   <b>Internationalization</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Some  variables  and command arguments support internationalization via CMake script. This is an optional
       feature.

       Installers created by QtIFW tools have built-in support for internationalization  and  many  phrases  are
       localized to many languages, but this does not apply to the description of your components and groups.

       Localization of the description of your components and groups is useful for users of your installers.

       A  localized  variable or argument can contain a single default value, and after that a set of pairs with
       the name of the locale and the localized value.

       For example:

          set(LOCALIZABLE_VARIABLE "Default value"
            en "English value"
            en_US "American value"
            en_GB "Great Britain value"
            )

              Added in version 3.25.

              This variable is a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of arguments to prepend to the nsis script to run.  If
              the arguments do not start with a <b>/</b> or a <b>-</b>, it will add one  automatically  to  the  corresponding
              arguments.  The command that will be run is:

                 makensis.exe &lt;preArgs&gt;... "nsisFileName.nsi" &lt;postArgs&gt;...

              where  <b>&lt;preArgs&gt;...</b>  is constructed from <b>CPACK_NSIS_EXECUTABLE_PRE_ARGUMENTS</b> and <b>&lt;postArgs&gt;...</b>  is
              constructed from <b>CPACK_NSIS_EXECUTABLE_POST_ARGUMENTS</b>.

              arguments.  The command that will be run is:

                 makensis.exe &lt;preArgs&gt;... "nsisFileName.nsi" &lt;postArgs&gt;...

              where <b>&lt;preArgs&gt;...</b> is constructed from <b>CPACK_NSIS_EXECUTABLE_PRE_ARGUMENTS</b> and  <b>&lt;postArgs&gt;...</b>   is
              constructed from <b>CPACK_NSIS_EXECUTABLE_POST_ARGUMENTS</b>.

   <b>CPack</b> <b>NuGet</b> <b>Generator</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       When  build  a  NuGet  package  there  is  no  direct way to control an output filename due a lack of the
       corresponding CLI option of NuGet, so there is no <b>CPACK_NUGET_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME</b>  variable.  To  form  the
       output filename NuGet uses the package name and the version according to its built-in rules.

       Also, be aware that including a top level directory (<u>CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY</u>) is ignored by this
       generator.

   <b>Variables</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> <b>CPack</b> <b>NuGet</b> <b>generator</b>
       The  CPack NuGet generator may be used to create NuGet packages using <u>CPack</u>. The CPack NuGet generator is
       a <u>CPack</u> generator thus it uses the <b>CPACK_XXX</b> variables used by <u>CPack</u>.

       The CPack NuGet generator has specific features which are controlled  by  the  specifics  <b>CPACK_NUGET_XXX</b>
       variables.  In  the  "one  per group" mode (see <u>CPACK_COMPONENTS_GROUPING</u>), <b>&lt;compName&gt;</b> placeholder in the
       variables below would contain a group name (uppercased and turned into a "C" identifier).

              variable is not defined for a given component.

       <b>CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_RESOURCES_DIR</b>
              Added in version 3.9.

              If  specified  the  productbuild  generator  copies   files   from   this   directory   (including
              subdirectories)  to  the <b>Resources</b> directory. This is done before the <u>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME</u>,
              <u>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README</u>, and <u>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE</u> files are copied.

       <b>CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS</b>
              Added in version 3.23.

              This option enables more granular control over where the product may be installed. When it is  set
              to  true  (see  policy  <u>CMP0161</u>),  a  <b>domains</b>  element  of the following form will be added to the
              productbuild Distribution XML:

                 &lt;domains enable_anywhere="true" enable_currentUserHome="false" enable_localSystem="true"/&gt;

              The    default    values    are    as    shown    above,    but    can    be    overridden    with
              <u>CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS_ANYWHERE</u>,              <u>CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS_USER</u>,             and
              <u>CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS_ROOT</u>.

       <b>CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS_ANYWHERE</b>
              Added in version 3.23.

              May be used to override the <b>enable_anywhere</b> attribute in the <b>domains</b> element of  the  Distribution
              XML.  When  set  to  true,  the  product  can  be  installed  at the root of any volume, including
              non-system volumes.

              <u>CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS</u> must be set to true for this variable to have any effect.

       <b>CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS_USER</b>
              Added in version 3.23.

              May be used to override the  <b>enable_currentUserHome</b>  attribute  in  the  <b>domains</b>  element  of  the
              Distribution  XML.  When  set  to  true, the product can be installed into the current user's home
              directory. Note that when installing into the user's  home  directory,  the  following  additional
              requirements will apply:

              • The installer may not write outside the user's home directory.

              • The  install  will  be  performed  as  the  current  user  rather  than  as <b>root</b>.  This may have
                ramifications for <u>CPACK_PREFLIGHT_&lt;COMP&gt;_SCRIPT</u> and <u>CPACK_POSTFLIGHT_&lt;COMP&gt;_SCRIPT</u>.

              • Administrative privileges will not be needed to perform the install.

              <u>CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS</u> must be set to true for this variable to have any effect.

              Added in version 3.23.

              May be  used  to  override  the  <b>enable_localSystem</b>  attribute  in  the  <b>domains</b>  element  of  the
              Distribution  XML.  When  set  to  true,  the product can be installed in the root directory. This
              should normally be set to true unless the product should only be  installed  to  the  user's  home
              directory.

              <u>CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS</u> must be set to true for this variable to have any effect.

   <b>Background</b> <b>Image</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       This group of variables controls the background image of the generated installer.

       <b>CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_BACKGROUND</b>

   <b>Distribution</b> <b>XML</b> <b>Template</b>
       CPack uses a template file to generate  the  <b>distribution.dist</b>  file  used  internally  by  this  package
       generator.  Ordinarily,  CMake provides the template file, but projects may supply their own by placing a
       file called <b>CPack.distribution.dist.in</b>  in  one  of  the  directories  listed  in  the  <u>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</u>
       variable. CPack will then pick up the project's template file instead of using its own.

       The  <b>distribution.dist</b>  file  is  generated  by  performing substitutions similar to the <u>configure_file()</u>
       command. Any variable set when CPack runs will be available for substitution using the usual <b>@...@</b>  form.
       The following variables are also set internally and made available for substitution:

       <b>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE_NOPATH</b>
              Same  as <u>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE</u> except without the path.  The named file will be available in
              the same directory as the generated <b>distribution.dist</b> file.

       <b>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README_NOPATH</b>
              Same as <u>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README</u> except without the path.  The named file will be  available  in
              the same directory as the generated <b>distribution.dist</b> file.

       <b>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME_NOPATH</b>
              Same  as <u>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME</u> except without the path.  The named file will be available in
              the same directory as the generated <b>distribution.dist</b> file.

       <b>CPACK_APPLE_PKG_INSTALLER_CONTENT</b>
              Added in version 3.23.

              This contains all the XML elements that specify installer-wide options (including domain details),
              default backgrounds and the choices outline.

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGEMAKER_CHOICES</b>
              Deprecated since version 3.23.

              This contains only the XML elements that specify the default backgrounds and the choices  outline.
              It    does    not    include   the   installer-wide   options   or   any   domain   details.   Use
              <b>CPACK_APPLE_PKG_INSTALLER_CONTENT</b> instead.

   <b>CPack</b> <b>RPM</b> <b>Generator</b>
       The built in (binary) CPack RPM generator (Unix only)

   <b>Variables</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> <b>CPack</b> <b>RPM</b> <b>generator</b>
       The CPack RPM generator may be used to create RPM packages using <u>CPack</u>.  The CPack  RPM  generator  is  a
       <u>CPack</u> generator thus it uses the <b>CPACK_XXX</b> variables used by <u>CPack</u>.

       The  CPack  RPM  generator  has  specific  features  which  are controlled by the specifics <b>CPACK_RPM_XXX</b>
       variables.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_XXXX</b> variables may be used  in  order  to  have  <b>component-specific</b>  values.   Note
       however  that <b>&lt;COMPONENT&gt;</b> refers to the <b>grouping</b> <b>name</b> written in upper case. It may be either a component
       name or a component GROUP name. Usually, those variables correspond to RPM spec file  entities.  One  may
       find information about spec files here <u>https://rpm.org/documentation</u>.

       Changed in version 3.6: <u>&lt;COMPONENT&gt;</u> part of variables is preferred to be in upper case (e.g. if component
       is  named  <b>foo</b>  then use <b>CPACK_RPM_FOO_XXXX</b> variable name format) as is with other <b>CPACK_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_XXXX</b>
       variables.  For the purposes of back compatibility (CMake/CPack version 3.5 and lower) support  for  same
       cased  component  (e.g. <b>fOo</b> would be used as <b>CPACK_RPM_fOo_XXXX</b>) is still supported for variables defined
       in older versions of CMake/CPack but is not guaranteed for variables that will be added  in  the  future.
       For  the  sake  of  back  compatibility same cased component variables also override upper cased versions
       where both are present.

       Here are some CPack RPM generator wiki resources that are here for historic reasons  and  are  no  longer
       maintained but may still prove useful:

          • <u>https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/cpack/Configuration</u>

          • <u>https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/cpack/PackageGenerators#rpm-unix-only</u>

       List of CPack RPM generator specific variables:

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>OFF</b>

              If  enabled  (<b>ON</b>) multiple packages are generated. By default a single package containing files of
              all components is generated.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SUMMARY</b>

       <b>CPACK_RPM_&lt;component&gt;_PACKAGE_SUMMARY</b>
              The RPM package summary.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY</u>

              Added in version 3.2: Per-component <b>CPACK_RPM_&lt;component&gt;_PACKAGE_SUMMARY</b> variables.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_NAME</b>

       <b>CPACK_RPM_&lt;component&gt;_PACKAGE_NAME</b>
              The RPM package name.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

       <b>CPACK_RPM_&lt;component&gt;_FILE_NAME</b>
              Added in version 3.6.

              Package file name.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>&lt;CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME&gt;[-&lt;component&gt;].rpm</b> with spaces replaced by '-'

              This may be set to:

              <b>RPM-DEFAULT</b>
                     Tell <b>rpmbuild</b> to automatically generate the package file name.

              <b>&lt;file-name&gt;[.rpm]</b>
                     Use the given file name.

                     Changed in  version  3.29:  The  <b>.rpm</b>  suffix  will  be  automatically  added  if  missing.
                     Previously the suffix was required.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 By  using  user  provided  spec  file,  rpm  macro  extensions such as for generating <b>debuginfo</b>
                 packages or by simply using multiple components more than one rpm file may be generated, either
                 from a single spec file or from multiple spec files (each component execution produces its  own
                 spec  file).  In such cases duplicate file names may occur as a result of this variable setting
                 or spec file content structure. Duplicate files get overwritten and it is up to the packager to
                 set the variables in a manner that will prevent such errors.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_MAIN_COMPONENT</b>
              Added in version 3.8.

              Main component that is packaged without component suffix.

              <b>Default</b>

              This variable can be set to any component or group name so that component or group rpm package  is
              generated without component suffix in filename and package name.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_EPOCH</b>
              Added in version 3.10.

              The RPM package epoch

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>

              Optional  number that should be incremented when changing versioning schemas or fixing mistakes in
              the version numbers of older packages.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION</b>
              The RPM package version.

              <b>Default</b>
                     1

              This is the numbering of the RPM package itself, i.e. the version of the  packaging  and  not  the
              version  of  the  content (see <u>CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION</u>). One may change the default value if the
              previous packaging was buggy and/or you want to put here a fancy Linux distro specific numbering.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This is the string that goes into the RPM <b>Release:</b> field. Some distros (e.g. Fedora,  CentOS)  require
          <b>1%{?dist}</b>   format   and   not   just   a   number.    <b>%{?dist}</b>   part   can   be   added  by  setting
          <u>CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE_DIST</u>.

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>OFF</b>

              This is the reported <b>%{dist}</b> tag from the current distribution or empty <b>%{dist}</b> if  RPM  macro  is
              not   set.   If   this   variable   is   set   then   RPM   <b>Release:</b>   field   value   is  set  to
              <b>${CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE}%{?dist}</b>.

              in  order  to  install  it  at an alternate place see <a href="../man8/rpm.8.html">rpm</a>(8). Note that currently this may fail if
              <u>CPACK_SET_DESTDIR</u> is set to <b>ON</b>. If <u>CPACK_SET_DESTDIR</u> is set then you will get  a  warning  message
              but if there is file installed with absolute path you'll get unexpected behavior.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_SPEC_INSTALL_POST</b>
              Deprecated since version 2.8.12: Use <u>CPACK_RPM_SPEC_MORE_DEFINE</u> instead.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>

              May  be  used  to  override  the <b>__spec_install_post</b> section within the generated spec file.  This
              affects the install step during package creation, not during  package  installation.   For  adding
              operations  to  be  performed  during package installation, use <u>CPACK_RPM_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE</u>
              instead.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_SPEC_MORE_DEFINE</b>
              RPM extended spec definitions lines.

                     No

              <b>Default</b>

              May be used to add any <b>%define</b> lines to the generated spec file.  An example  of  its  use  is  to
              prevent  stripping  of executables (but note that this may also disable other default post install
              processing):

                 set(CPACK_RPM_SPEC_MORE_DEFINE "%define __spec_install_post <a href="file:/bin/true">/bin/true</a>")

       <b>CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DEBUG</b>

              <b>Default</b>

              May  be  set  by  the user in order to specify a USER binary spec file to be used by the CPack RPM
              generator instead of generating the file.  The specified file will be processed by configure_file(
              @ONLY).

       <b>CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE</b>
              Spec file template.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>

              If set CPack will generate a template for USER specified binary spec file and stop with an  error.
              For example launch CPack like this:

                 cpack -D CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE=1 -G RPM

              The  user  may then use this file in order to hand-craft is own binary spec file which may be used
              with <u>CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE</u>.

              May   be   used   to   explicitly  specify  <b>%(&lt;directive&gt;)</b>  file  line  in  the  spec  file.  Like
              <b>%config(noreplace)</b> or any other directive that be found in the <b>%files</b> section. Since the CPack RPM
              generator is generating the list of files (and  directories)  the  user  specified  files  of  the
              <b>CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_USER_FILELIST</b>  list will be removed from the generated list. If referring to
              directories do not add a trailing slash.

              Added in version 3.8: You can have  multiple  directives  per  line,  as  in  <b>%attr(600,root,root)</b>
              <b>%config(noreplace)</b>.

              May be used to exclude  path  (directories  or  files)  from  the  auto-generated  list  of  paths
              discovered  by CPack RPM. The default value contains a reasonable set of values if the variable is
              not defined by the user. If the variable is defined by the user then the CPack RPM generator  will
              NOT  any  of  the  default path. If you want to add some path to the default list then you can use
              <u>CPACK_RPM_EXCLUDE_FROM_AUTO_FILELIST_ADDITION</u> variable.

              Added in version 3.10: Added <b>/usr/share/aclocal</b> to the default list of excludes.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>

              May  be  used  to  specify more than one relocation path per relocatable RPM.  Variable contains a
              list   of   relocation   paths   that   if   relative   are   prefixed    by    the    value    of
              <u>CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_PREFIX</u>  or  by  the  value  of <u>CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> if the
              component version is not provided.  Variable is not component based as its content can be used  to
              set  a  different  path  prefix  for e.g. binary dir and documentation dir at the same time.  Only
              prefixes that are required by a certain component are added to that  component  -  component  must
              contain  at  least  one  file/directory/symbolic link with <u>CPACK_RPM_RELOCATION_PATHS</u> prefix for a
              certain relocation path to be added. Package will not contain any relocation paths if there are no
              files/directories/symbolic links on any of the provided prefix locations.  Packages that either do
              not contain any relocation paths or contain  files/directories/symbolic  links  that  are  outside
              relocation paths print out an <u>AUTHOR_WARNING</u> that RPM will be partially relocatable.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PACKAGE_PREFIX</b>

       <b>CPACK_RPM_&lt;compName&gt;_DEFAULT_GROUP</b>
              Added in version 3.6.

              default group ownership of RPM content

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>
                     root

              Value should be group name and not GID.  Note that <b>&lt;compName&gt;</b> must be in upper-case.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_DEFAULT_FILE_PERMISSIONS</b>

       <b>CPACK_RPM_&lt;compName&gt;_DEFAULT_FILE_PERMISSIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.6.

              default permissions used for packaged files

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>
                     (system default)

              Accepted values are lists with PERMISSIONS. Valid permissions are:

              • <b>OWNER_READ</b>

              • <b>OWNER_WRITE</b>

              • <b>OWNER_EXECUTE</b>

              • <b>GROUP_READ</b>

              • <b>GROUP_WRITE</b>

              • <b>GROUP_EXECUTE</b>

              • <b>WORLD_READ</b>

              • <b>WORLD_WRITE</b>

              • <b>WORLD_EXECUTE</b>

              Note that <b>&lt;compName&gt;</b> must be in upper-case.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_DEFAULT_DIR_PERMISSIONS</b>

       <b>CPACK_RPM_&lt;compName&gt;_DEFAULT_DIR_PERMISSIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.6.

              default permissions used for packaged directories

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>
                     (system default)

              Accepted  values  are  lists  with  PERMISSIONS.  Valid  permissions   are   the   same   as   for
              <u>CPACK_RPM_DEFAULT_FILE_PERMISSIONS</u>.  Note that <b>&lt;compName&gt;</b> must be in upper-case.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_INSTALL_WITH_EXEC</b>
              Added in version 3.11.

              force execute permissions on programs and shared libraries

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>
                     (system default)

              Force set owner, group and world execute permissions on programs and shared libraries. This can be
              used  for creating valid rpm packages on systems such as Debian where shared libraries do not have
              execute permissions set.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Programs and shared libraries without execute permissions  are  ignored  during  separation  of  debug
          symbols from the binary for debuginfo packages.

   <b>Packaging</b> <b>of</b> <b>Symbolic</b> <b>Links</b>
       Added in version 3.3.

       The CPack RPM generator supports packaging of symbolic links:

          execute_process(COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND}
            -E create_symlink &lt;relative_path_location&gt; &lt;symlink_name&gt;)
          install(FILES ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/&lt;symlink_name&gt;
            DESTINATION &lt;symlink_location&gt; COMPONENT libraries)

       Symbolic  links will be optimized (paths will be shortened if possible) before being added to the package
       or if multiple relocation paths are detected, a post install symlink relocation script will be generated.

       Symbolic links may point to locations that are not packaged by  the  same  package  (either  a  different
       component  or even not packaged at all) but those locations will be treated as if they were a part of the
       package while determining if symlink should be either created or present  in  a  post  install  script  -
       depending on relocation paths.

       Changed  in  version 3.6: Symbolic links that point to locations outside packaging path produce a warning
       and are treated as non relocatable permanent symbolic links.  Previous  versions  of  CMake  produced  an
       error in this case.

       Currently there are a few limitations though:

       • For  component based packaging component interdependency is not checked when processing symbolic links.
         Symbolic links pointing to content of a different component are treated the same way as if pointing  to
         location that will not be packaged.

       • Symbolic  links  pointing  to  a  location  through one or more intermediate symbolic links will not be
         handled differently - if the intermediate symbolic link(s) is also on a relocatable path, relocating it
         during package installation may cause initial symbolic link to point to an invalid location.

   <b>Packaging</b> <b>of</b> <b>debug</b> <b>information</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Debuginfo packages contain debug symbols and sources for debugging packaged binaries.

       Debuginfo RPM packaging has its own set of variables:

       <b>CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_PACKAGE</b>

       <b>CPACK_RPM_&lt;component&gt;_DEBUGINFO_PACKAGE</b>
              Enable generation of debuginfo RPM package(s).

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>OFF</b>

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Binaries must contain debug symbols before  packaging  so  use  either  <b>Debug</b>  or  <b>RelWithDebInfo</b>  for
          <u>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</u> variable value.

          Additionally,  if  <u>CPACK_STRIP_FILES</u>  is  set,  the  files will be stripped before they get to the RPM
          generator, so will not contain debug symbols and a debuginfo package will not get built.  Do  not  use
          with <u>CPACK_STRIP_FILES</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Packages  generated  from  packages  without  binary  files,  with  binary  files  but without execute
          permissions or without debug symbols will cause packaging termination.

       <b>CPACK_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS</b>
              Provides locations of root directories of source files from which binaries were built.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes if <u>CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_PACKAGE</u> is set

              <b>Default</b>

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          For CMake project  <u>CPACK_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS</u>  is  set  by  default  to  point  to  <u>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</u>  and
          <u>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</u> paths.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Sources  with  path prefixes that do not fall under any location provided with <u>CPACK_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS</u>
          will not be present in debuginfo package.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS_PREFIX</b>

       <b>CPACK_RPM_&lt;component&gt;_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS_PREFIX</b>
              Prefix of location where sources will be placed during package installation.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes if <u>CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_PACKAGE</u> is set

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>/usr/src/debug/${CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME}</b>      and      for       component       packaging
                     <b>/usr/src/debug/${CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME}-&lt;component&gt;</b>

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Each  source path prefix is additionally suffixed by <b>src_&lt;index&gt;</b> where index is index of the path used
          from <u>CPACK_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS</u> variable. This produces <b>${CPACK_RPM_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS_PREFIX}/src_&lt;index&gt;</b>
          replacement path.  Limitation is that replaced path part must be shorter or of equal length  than  the
          length  of its replacement. If that is not the case either <u>CPACK_RPM_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS_PREFIX</u> variable
          has to be set to a shorter path or source directories must be placed on a longer path.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_EXCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              Directories containing sources that should be excluded from debuginfo packages.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>

                     <b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>by</b> <b>default:</b>

                            • <b><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b>

                            • <b><a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a></b>

                            • <b>/usr/src/debug</b>

              Listed paths are owned by other RPM packages and should therefore  not  be  deleted  on  debuginfo
              package uninstallation.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_EXCLUDE_DIRS_ADDITION</b>
              Paths that should be appended to <u>CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_EXCLUDE_DIRS</u> for exclusion.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>

       <b>CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_SINGLE_PACKAGE</b>
              Added in version 3.8.

              Create a single debuginfo package even if components packaging is set.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>OFF</b>

              When  this  variable is enabled it produces a single debuginfo package even if component packaging
              is enabled.

              When using this feature in combination with components  packaging  and  there  is  more  than  one
              component this variable requires <u>CPACK_RPM_MAIN_COMPONENT</u> to be set.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          If     none     of    the    <u>CPACK_RPM_&lt;component&gt;_DEBUGINFO_PACKAGE</u>    variables    is    set    then
          <u>CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_PACKAGE</u> is automatically set to <b>ON</b> when <u>CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_SINGLE_PACKAGE</u> is set.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_FILE_NAME</b>

       <b>CPACK_RPM_&lt;component&gt;_DEBUGINFO_FILE_NAME</b>
              Added in version 3.9.

              Debuginfo package file name.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>
                     rpmbuild tool generated package file name

              Alternatively provided debuginfo package file name must end with <b>.rpm</b>  suffix  and  should  differ
              from file names of other generated packages.

              Variable  may  contain  <b>@cpack_component@</b>  placeholder which will be replaced by component name if
              component packaging is enabled otherwise it deletes the placeholder.

              Setting the variable to <b>RPM-DEFAULT</b> may be used to explicitly set filename generation to default.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          <u>CPACK_RPM_FILE_NAME</u> also supports rpmbuild tool generated package file name - disabled by default  but
          can be enabled by setting the variable to <b>RPM-DEFAULT</b>.

   <b>Packaging</b> <b>of</b> <b>sources</b> <b>(SRPM)</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       SRPM   packaging   is   enabled   by  setting  <u>CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SOURCES</u>  variable  while  usually  using
       <u>CPACK_INSTALLED_DIRECTORIES</u> variable to provide directory containing CMakeLists.txt and source files.

       For CMake projects SRPM package would be produced by executing:

          cpack -G RPM --config ./CPackSourceConfig.cmake

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Produced SRPM package is expected to be built with <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u>  executable  and  packaged  with  <u><a href="../man1/cpack.1.html">cpack</a>(1)</u>
          executable  so  CMakeLists.txt has to be located in root source directory and must be able to generate
          binary rpm packages by executing <u>cpack</u> <u>-G</u> command. The two executables as well as rpmbuild  must  also
          be present when generating binary rpm packages from the produced SRPM package.

       Once  the  SRPM  package  is generated it can be used to generate binary packages by creating a directory
       structure for rpm generation and executing rpmbuild tool:

          mkdir -p build_dir/{BUILD,BUILDROOT,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}
          rpmbuild --define "_topdir &lt;path_to_build_dir&gt;" --rebuild &lt;SRPM_file_name&gt;

       Generated packages will be located in build_dir/RPMS directory or its sub directories.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          SRPM package internally uses CPack/RPM generator to generate binary packages so  CMakeScripts.txt  can
          decide  during  the SRPM to binary rpm generation step what content the package(s) should have as well
          as how they should be packaged (monolithic or components). CMake can decide this for e.g.  by  reading
          environment  variables set by the package manager before starting the process of generating binary rpm
          packages. This way a single SRPM package can be used to  produce  different  binary  rpm  packages  on
          different platforms depending on the platform's packaging rules.

       Source RPM packaging has its own set of variables:

       <b>CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SOURCES</b>
              Should the content be packaged as a source rpm (default is binary rpm).

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>OFF</b>

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          For  cmake  projects  <u>CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SOURCES</u>  variable is set to <b>OFF</b> in CPackConfig.cmake and <b>ON</b> in
          CPackSourceConfig.cmake generated files.

       <b>CPACK_RPM_SOURCE_PKG_BUILD_PARAMS</b>
              Additional command-line parameters provided to <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u> executable.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>

       <b>CPACK_RPM_SOURCE_PKG_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX</b>
              Packaging install prefix that would be provided  in  <u>CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>  variable  for
              producing binary RPM packages.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     Yes

              <b>Default</b>
                     <b>/</b>

       <b>CPACK_RPM_BUILDREQUIRES</b>
              List of source rpm build dependencies.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>

              May  be  used to set source RPM build dependencies (BuildRequires). Note that you must enclose the
              complete build requirements string between quotes, for example:

                 set(CPACK_RPM_BUILDREQUIRES "python &gt;= 2.5.0, cmake &gt;= 2.8")

       <b>CPACK_RPM_REQUIRES_EXCLUDE_FROM</b>
              Added in version 3.22.

              <b>Mandatory</b>
                     No

              <b>Default</b>

              May be used to keep the dependency generator from  scanning  specific  files  or  directories  for
              dependencies.   Note  that you can use a regular expression that matches all of the directories or
              files, for example:

                 set(CPACK_RPM_REQUIRES_EXCLUDE_FROM "bin/libqsqloci.*\\.so.*")

   <b>CPack</b> <b>WIX</b> <b>Generator</b>
       Use the <u>WiX</u> <u>Toolset</u> to produce a Windows Installer <b>.msi</b> database.

       Added in version 3.7: The <u>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DISABLED</u> variable is now supported.

   <b>WiX</b> <b>Toolsets</b>
       CPack selects one of the following variants of the WiX Toolset based on the <u>CPACK_WIX_VERSION</u> variable:

       • <u>WiX</u> <u>.NET</u> <u>Tools</u>

       • <u>WiX</u> <u>Toolset</u> <u>v3</u>

   <b>WiX</b> <b>.NET</b> <b>Tools</b>
       Packaging is performed using the following tools:

       <b>wix</b> <b>build</b>
              Build WiX source files directly into a Windows Installer <b>.msi</b> database.

              Invocations may be customized using tool-specific variables:

              • <u>CPACK_WIX_BUILD_EXTENSIONS</u>

              • <u>CPACK_WIX_BUILD_EXTRA_FLAGS</u>

       WiX extensions must be named with the form <b>WixToolset.&lt;Name&gt;.wixext</b>.

       CPack expects the <b>wix</b> .NET tool to be available for command-line use with  any  required  WiX  extensions
       already  installed.  Be sure the <b>wix</b> version is compatible with <u>CPACK_WIX_VERSION</u>, and that WiX extension
       versions match the <b>wix</b> tool version.  For example:

       1. Install the <b>wix</b> command-line tool using <b>dotnet</b>.
          To install <b>wix</b> globally for the current user:

              dotnet tool install --global wix --version 4.0.4

          This places <b>wix.exe</b> in <b>%USERPROFILE%\.dotnet\tools</b> and adds the directory to the current  user's  <b>PATH</b>
          environment variable.

          Or, to install <b>wix</b> in a specific path, e.g., in <b>c:\WiX</b>:

              dotnet tool install --tool-path c:\WiX wix --version 4.0.4

          This  places  <b>wix.exe</b>  in <b>c:\WiX</b>, but does <u>not</u> add it to the current user's <b>PATH</b> environment variable.
          The <b>WIX</b> environment variable may be set to tell CPack where to find the tool, e.g., <b>set</b> <b>WIX=c:\WiX</b>.

       2. Add the WiX <b>UI</b> extension, needed by CPack's default WiX template:

              wix extension add --global WixToolset.UI.wixext/4.0.4

          Extensions added globally are stored in  <b>%USERPROFILE%\.wix</b>,  or  if  the  <b>WIX_EXTENSIONS</b>  environment
          variable is set, in <b>%WIX_EXTENSIONS%\.wix</b>.

   <b>WiX</b> <b>Toolset</b> <b>v3</b>
       Packaging is performed using the following tools:

       <b>candle</b> Compiles WiX source files into <b>.wixobj</b> files.

              Invocations may be customized using tool-specific variables:

              • <u>CPACK_WIX_CANDLE_EXTENSIONS</u>

              • <u>CPACK_WIX_CANDLE_EXTRA_FLAGS</u>

       <b>light</b>  Links <b>.wixobj</b> files into a Windows Installer <b>.msi</b> database.

              Invocations may be customized using tool-specific variables:

              • <u>CPACK_WIX_LIGHT_EXTENSIONS</u>

              • <u>CPACK_WIX_LIGHT_EXTRA_FLAGS</u>

       CPack invokes both tools as needed.  Intermediate <b>.wixobj</b> files are considered implementation details.

       WiX extensions must be named with the form <b>Wix&lt;Name&gt;Extension</b>.

       CPack  expects  the  above  tools  to  be  available  for  command-line use via the <b>PATH</b>.  Or, if the <b>WIX</b>
       environment variable is set, CPack looks for the tools in <b>%WIX%</b> and <b>%WIX%\bin</b>.

   <b>Variables</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> <b>CPack</b> <b>WIX</b> <b>generator</b>
       The following variables are specific to the installers built on Windows using WiX.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_VERSION</b>
              Added in version 3.30.

              Specify the version of WiX Toolset for which the configuration is written.  The value must be  one
              of

              <b>4</b>      Package using <u>WiX</u> <u>.NET</u> <u>Tools</u>.

              <b>3</b>      Package using <u>WiX</u> <u>Toolset</u> <u>v3</u>.  This is the default.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_UPGRADE_GUID</b>
              Upgrade GUID (<b>Product/@UpgradeCode</b>)

              Will be automatically generated unless explicitly provided.

              It  should  be  explicitly  set to a constant generated globally unique identifier (GUID) to allow
              your installers to replace existing installations that use the same GUID.

              You may for example explicitly set this variable in your CMakeLists.txt to the value that has been
              generated per default.  You should not use GUIDs that you did not generate yourself or  which  may
              belong to other projects.

              A GUID shall have the following fixed length syntax:

                 XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX

              (each X represents an uppercase hexadecimal digit)

       <b>CPACK_WIX_PRODUCT_GUID</b>
              Product GUID (<b>Product/@Id</b>)

              Will be automatically generated unless explicitly provided.

              If explicitly provided this will set the Product Id of your installer.

              The installer will abort if it detects a pre-existing installation that uses the same GUID.

              The GUID shall use the syntax described for CPACK_WIX_UPGRADE_GUID.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_LICENSE_RTF</b>
              RTF License File

              If CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE has an .rtf extension it is used as-is.

              If  CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE has an .txt extension it is implicitly converted to RTF by the WIX
              Generator.  The expected encoding of the .txt file is UTF-8.

              With CPACK_WIX_LICENSE_RTF you can override the license file used by the  WIX  Generator  in  case
              CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE  is  in  an unsupported format or the .txt -&gt; .rtf conversion does not
              work as expected.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_PRODUCT_ICON</b>
              The Icon shown next to the program name in Add/Remove programs.

              If set, this icon is used in place of the default icon.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_UI_REF</b>
              Specify the WiX <b>UI</b> extension's dialog set:

              • With <u>WiX</u> <u>.NET</u> <u>Tools</u>, this is the Id of the <b>&lt;ui:WixUI&gt;</b> element in the default WiX template.

              • With <u>WiX</u> <u>Toolset</u> <u>v3</u>, this is the Id of the <b>&lt;UIRef&gt;</b> element in the default WiX template.

              The  default  is  <b>WixUI_InstallDir</b>  in  case  no  CPack   components   have   been   defined   and
              <b>WixUI_FeatureTree</b> otherwise.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_UI_BANNER</b>
              The  bitmap  will  appear  at the top of all installer pages other than the welcome and completion
              dialogs.

              If set, this image will replace the default banner image.

              This image must be 493 by 58 pixels.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_UI_DIALOG</b>
              Background bitmap used on the welcome and completion dialogs.

              If this variable is set, the installer will replace the default dialog image.

              This image must be 493 by 312 pixels.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_PROGRAM_MENU_FOLDER</b>
              Start menu folder name for launcher.

              If this variable is not set, it will be initialized with CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME

              Added in version 3.16: If this variable is set to <b>.</b>, then application shortcuts  will  be  created
              directly in the start menu and the uninstaller shortcut will be omitted.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_CULTURES</b>
              Language(s) of the installer

              Languages are compiled into the Wix <b>UI</b> extension library.  To use them, simply provide the name of
              the  culture.   If  you specify more than one culture identifier in a comma or semicolon delimited
              list, the first one that is found will be used.  You can find a list of supported languages at:  ‐
              <u>https://wixtoolset.org/docs/v3/wixui/wixui_localization/</u>

       <b>CPACK_WIX_TEMPLATE</b>
              Template file for WiX generation

              If  this  variable is set, the specified template will be used to generate the WiX wxs file.  This
              should be used if further customization of the output is  required.  The  template  contents  will
              override the effect of most <b>CPACK_WIX_</b> variables.

              If this variable is not set, the default MSI template included with CMake will be used.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_PATCH_FILE</b>
              Optional list of XML files with fragments to be inserted into generated WiX sources.

              Added in version 3.5: Support listing multiple patch files.

              This  optional  variable  can  be  used  to specify an XML file that the WIX generator will use to
              inject fragments into its generated source files.

              Patch files understood by the CPack WIX generator roughly follow this RELAX NG compact schema:

                 start = CPackWiXPatch

                 CPackWiXPatch = element CPackWiXPatch { CPackWiXFragment* }

                 CPackWiXFragment = element CPackWiXFragment
                 {
                     attribute Id { string },
                     fragmentContent*
                 }

                 fragmentContent = element * - CPackWiXFragment
                 {
                     (attribute * { text } | text | fragmentContent)*
                 }

              Currently fragments can be injected into most Component, File, Directory and Feature elements.

              Added in version 3.3: The following additional special Ids can be used:

              • <b>#PRODUCT</b> for the <b>&lt;Product&gt;</b> element.

              • <b>#PRODUCTFEATURE</b> for the root <b>&lt;Feature&gt;</b> element.

              Added in version 3.7: Support patching arbitrary <b>&lt;Feature&gt;</b> elements.

              Added in version 3.9: Allow setting additional attributes.

              The following example illustrates how this works.

              Given that the WIX generator creates the following XML element:

                 &lt;Component Id="CM_CP_applications.bin.my_libapp.exe" Guid="*"/&gt;

              The following XML patch file may be used to inject an Environment element into it:

                 &lt;CPackWiXPatch&gt;
                   &lt;CPackWiXFragment Id="CM_CP_applications.bin.my_libapp.exe"&gt;
                     &lt;Environment Id="MyEnvironment" Action="set"
                       Name="MyVariableName" Value="MyVariableValue"/&gt;
                   &lt;/CPackWiXFragment&gt;
                 &lt;/CPackWiXPatch&gt;

       <b>CPACK_WIX_EXTRA_SOURCES</b>
              Extra WiX source files

              This variable provides an optional list of extra WiX source files (<b>.wxs</b>) that should  be  compiled
              and linked.  The paths must be absolute.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_EXTRA_OBJECTS</b>
              Extra WiX object files or libraries to use with <u>WiX</u> <u>Toolset</u> <u>v3</u>.

              This variable provides an optional list of extra WiX object (<b>.wixobj</b>) and/or WiX library (<b>.wixlib</b>)
              files.  The paths must be absolute.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_EXTENSIONS</b>
              Specify  a  list  of  additional  extensions for WiX tools.  See <u>WiX</u> <u>Toolsets</u> for extension naming
              patterns.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_&lt;TOOL&gt;_EXTENSIONS</b>
              Specify a list of additional extensions for a specific WiX tool.  See <u>WiX</u>  <u>Toolsets</u>  for  possible
              <b>&lt;TOOL&gt;</b> names.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_&lt;TOOL&gt;_EXTRA_FLAGS</b>
              Specify  a  list  of  additional command-line flags for a specific WiX tool.  See <u>WiX</u> <u>Toolsets</u> for
              possible <b>&lt;TOOL&gt;</b> names.

              Use it at your own risk.  Future versions of CPack may generate flags which  may  be  in  conflict
              with your own flags.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b>
              If  this  variable is set the generated installer will create an entry in the windows registry key
              <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> The value  for  <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b>  is
              provided by this variable.

              Assuming  you also install a CMake configuration file this will allow other CMake projects to find
              your package with the <u>find_package()</u> command.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_PROPERTY_&lt;PROPERTY&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.1.

              This variable can be used to provide a value for the Windows Installer property <b>&lt;PROPERTY&gt;</b>

              The following list contains some example properties that can  be  used  to  customize  information
              under "Programs and Features" (also known as "Add or Remove Programs")

              • ARPCOMMENTS - Comments

              • ARPHELPLINK - Help and support information URL

              • ARPURLINFOABOUT - General information URL

              • ARPURLUPDATEINFO - Update information URL

              • ARPHELPTELEPHONE - Help and support telephone number

              • ARPSIZE - Size (in kilobytes) of the application

       <b>CPACK_WIX_ROOT_FEATURE_TITLE</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Sets    the   name   of   the   root   install   feature   in   the   WIX   installer.   Same   as
              CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DISPLAY_NAME for components.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_ROOT_FEATURE_DESCRIPTION</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Sets  the  description  of  the  root  install   feature   in   the   WIX   installer.   Same   as
              CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DESCRIPTION for components.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_SKIP_PROGRAM_FOLDER</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              If  this  variable  is  set to true, the default install location of the generated package will be
              CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY directly.  The install location will  not  be  located  relatively
              below ProgramFiles or ProgramFiles64.

                 <b>NOTE:</b>
                     Installers  created  with  this feature do not take differences between the system on which
                     the installer is created and the system on which the installer might be used into account.

                     It is therefore possible that the installer e.g. might try to install onto a drive that  is
                     unavailable  or unintended or a path that does not follow the localization or convention of
                     the system on which the installation is performed.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_ROOT_FOLDER_ID</b>
              Added in version 3.9.

              This variable allows specification of a custom root folder ID.  The generator specific <b>&lt;64&gt;</b>  token
              can  be  used  for folder IDs that come in 32-bit and 64-bit variants.  In 32-bit builds the token
              will expand empty while in 64-bit builds it will expand to <b>64</b>.

              When unset generated installers will default installing to <b>ProgramFiles&lt;64&gt;Folder</b>.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_ROOT</b>
              This variable can optionally be set to the root directory of a custom WiX Toolset installation.

              When unspecified CPack will try to locate a WiX  Toolset  installation  via  the  <b>WIX</b>  environment
              variable instead.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_CUSTOM_XMLNS</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              This  variable  provides  a list of custom namespace declarations that are necessary for using WiX
              extensions. Each declaration should be in the form name=url, where name  is  the  plain  namespace
              without the usual xmlns: prefix and url is an unquoted namespace url. A list of commonly known WiX
              schemata can be found here: <u>https://wixtoolset.org/docs/v3/xsd/</u>

       <b>CPACK_WIX_SKIP_WIX_UI_EXTENSION</b>
              Added in version 3.23.

              If  this  variable is set to true, the default inclusion of the WiX <b>UI</b> extension is skipped, i.e.,
              the <b>-ext</b> <b>WixUIExtension</b> or <b>-ext</b> <b>WixToolset.UI.wixext</b> flag is not passed to WiX tools.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_ARCHITECTURE</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              This variable can be optionally set to specify the target architecture of the installer.  May  for
              example be set to <b>x64</b> or <b>arm64</b>.

              When unspecified, CPack will default to <b>x64</b> or <b>x86</b>.

       <b>CPACK_WIX_INSTALL_SCOPE</b>
              Added in version 3.29.

              This variable can be optionally set to specify the <b>InstallScope</b> of the installer:

              <b>perMachine</b>
                     Create  an  installer  that  installs for all users and requires administrative privileges.
                     Start menu entries created by the installer are visible to all users.

                     This is the default.  See policy <u>CMP0172</u>.

              <b>perUser</b>
                     Not yet supported. This is reserved for future use.

              <b>NONE</b>   Create an installer without any <b>InstallScope</b> attribute.

                     This is supported only if <u>CPACK_WIX_VERSION</u> is not set, or is set to <b>3</b>.

                     Deprecated since version 3.29: This value is only for compatibility with  the  inconsistent
                     behavior  used  by  CPack  3.28 and older.  The resulting installer requires administrative
                     privileges and installs into the system-wide <b>ProgramFiles</b> directory,  but  the  start  menu
                     entry and uninstaller registration are created only for the current user.

                     <b>WARNING:</b>
                        An  installation  performed  by  an installer created without any <b>InstallScope</b> cannot be
                        cleanly updated or  replaced  by  an  installer  with  an  <b>InstallScope</b>.   In  order  to
                        transition  a  project's installers from <b>NONE</b> to <b>perMachine</b>, the latter installer should
                        be distributed with instructions to first manually uninstall any older version.
