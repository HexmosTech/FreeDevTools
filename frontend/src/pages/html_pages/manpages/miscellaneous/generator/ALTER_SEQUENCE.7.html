       ALTER SEQUENCE [ IF EXISTS ] <u>name</u> SET SCHEMA <u>new_schema</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ALTER</b> <b>SEQUENCE</b> changes the parameters of an existing sequence generator. Any parameters not specifically
       set in the <b>ALTER</b> <b>SEQUENCE</b> command retain their prior settings.

       You must own the sequence to use <b>ALTER</b> <b>SEQUENCE</b>. To change a sequence's schema, you must also have CREATE
       privilege on the new schema. To alter the owner, you must be able to SET ROLE to the new owning role, and
       that role must have CREATE privilege on the sequence's schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering
       the owner doesn't do anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the sequence. However, a
       superuser can alter ownership of any sequence anyway.)

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>name</u>
           The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a sequence to be altered.

       IF EXISTS
           Do not throw an error if the sequence does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

       <u>data_type</u>
           The optional clause AS <u>data_type</u> changes the data type of the sequence. Valid types are smallint,
           integer, and bigint.

           Changing the data type automatically changes the minimum and maximum values of the sequence if and
           only if the previous minimum and maximum values were the minimum or maximum value of the old data
           type (in other words, if the sequence had been created using NO MINVALUE or NO MAXVALUE, implicitly
           or explicitly). Otherwise, the minimum and maximum values are preserved, unless new values are given
           as part of the same command. If the minimum and maximum values do not fit into the new data type, an
           error will be generated.

       <u>increment</u>
           The clause INCREMENT BY <u>increment</u> is optional. A positive value will make an ascending sequence, a
           negative one a descending sequence. If unspecified, the old increment value will be maintained.

       <u>minvalue</u>
       NO MINVALUE
           The optional clause MINVALUE <u>minvalue</u> determines the minimum value a sequence can generate. If NO
           MINVALUE is specified, the defaults of 1 and the minimum value of the data type for ascending and
           descending sequences, respectively, will be used. If neither option is specified, the current minimum
           value will be maintained.

       <u>maxvalue</u>
       NO MAXVALUE
           The optional clause MAXVALUE <u>maxvalue</u> determines the maximum value for the sequence. If NO MAXVALUE
           is specified, the defaults of the maximum value of the data type and -1 for ascending and descending
           sequences, respectively, will be used. If neither option is specified, the current maximum value will
           be maintained.

       <u>start</u>
           The optional clause START WITH <u>start</u> changes the recorded start value of the sequence. This has no
           effect on the <u>current</u> sequence value; it simply sets the value that future <b>ALTER</b> <b>SEQUENCE</b> <b>RESTART</b>
           commands will use.

       <u>restart</u>
           The optional clause RESTART [ WITH <u>restart</u> ] changes the current value of the sequence. This is
           similar to calling the <b>setval</b> function with is_called = false: the specified value will be returned
           by the <u>next</u> call of <b>nextval</b>. Writing RESTART with no <u>restart</u> value is equivalent to supplying the
           start value that was recorded by <b>CREATE</b> <b>SEQUENCE</b> or last set by <b>ALTER</b> <b>SEQUENCE</b> <b>START</b> <b>WITH</b>.

           In contrast to a <b>setval</b> call, a RESTART operation on a sequence is transactional and blocks
           concurrent transactions from obtaining numbers from the same sequence. If that's not the desired mode
           of operation, <b>setval</b> should be used.

       <u>cache</u>
           The clause CACHE <u>cache</u> enables sequence numbers to be preallocated and stored in memory for faster
           access. The minimum value is 1 (only one value can be generated at a time, i.e., no cache). If
           unspecified, the old cache value will be maintained.

       CYCLE
           The optional CYCLE key word can be used to enable the sequence to wrap around when the <u>maxvalue</u> or
           <u>minvalue</u> has been reached by an ascending or descending sequence respectively. If the limit is
           reached, the next number generated will be the <u>minvalue</u> or <u>maxvalue</u>, respectively.

       NO CYCLE
           If the optional NO CYCLE key word is specified, any calls to <b>nextval</b> after the sequence has reached
           its maximum value will return an error. If neither CYCLE or NO CYCLE are specified, the old cycle
           behavior will be maintained.

       SET { LOGGED | UNLOGGED }
           This form changes the sequence from unlogged to logged or vice-versa (see CREATE SEQUENCE
           (<b><a href="../man7/CREATE_SEQUENCE.7.html">CREATE_SEQUENCE</a></b>(7))). It cannot be applied to a temporary sequence.

       OWNED BY <u>table_name</u>.<u>column_name</u>
       OWNED BY NONE
           The OWNED BY option causes the sequence to be associated with a specific table column, such that if
           that column (or its whole table) is dropped, the sequence will be automatically dropped as well. If
           specified, this association replaces any previously specified association for the sequence. The
           specified table must have the same owner and be in the same schema as the sequence. Specifying OWNED
           BY NONE removes any existing association, making the sequence “free-standing”.

       <u>new_owner</u>
           The user name of the new owner of the sequence.

       <u>new_name</u>
           The new name for the sequence.

       <u>new_schema</u>
           The new schema for the sequence.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ALTER</b> <b>SEQUENCE</b> will not immediately affect <b>nextval</b> results in backends, other than the current one, that
       have preallocated (cached) sequence values. They will use up all cached values prior to noticing the
       changed sequence generation parameters. The current backend will be affected immediately.

       <b>ALTER</b> <b>SEQUENCE</b> does not affect the <b>currval</b> status for the sequence. (Before PostgreSQL 8.3, it sometimes
       did.)

       <b>ALTER</b> <b>SEQUENCE</b> blocks concurrent <b>nextval</b>, <b>currval</b>, <b>lastval</b>, and <b>setval</b> calls.

       For historical reasons, <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b> can be used with sequences too; but the only variants of <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       that are allowed with sequences are equivalent to the forms shown above.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Restart a sequence called serial, at 105:

           ALTER SEQUENCE serial RESTART WITH 105;

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ALTER</b> <b>SEQUENCE</b> conforms to the SQL standard, except for the AS, START WITH, OWNED BY, OWNER TO, RENAME
       TO, and SET SCHEMA clauses, which are PostgreSQL extensions.
