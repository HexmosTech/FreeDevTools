</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       property - Properties, a selection mechanism for algorithm implementations

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       As of OpenSSL 3.0, a new method has been introduced to decide which of multiple implementations of an
       algorithm will be used.  The method is centered around the concept of properties.  Each implementation
       defines a number of properties and when an algorithm is being selected, filters based on these properties
       can be used to choose the most appropriate implementation of the algorithm.

       Properties are like variables, they are referenced by name and have a value assigned.

   <b>Property</b> <b>Names</b>
       Property names fall into two categories: those reserved by the OpenSSL project and user defined names.  A
       <u>reserved</u> property name consists of a single C-style identifier (except for leading underscores not being
       permitted), which begins with a letter and can be followed by any number of letters, numbers and
       underscores.  Property names are case-insensitive, but OpenSSL will only use lowercase letters.

       A <u>user</u> <u>defined</u> property name is similar, but it <b>must</b> consist of two or more C-style identifiers,
       separated by periods.  The last identifier in the name can be considered the 'true' property name, which
       is prefixed by some sort of 'namespace'.  Providers for example could include their name in the prefix
       and use property names like

         &lt;provider_name&gt;.&lt;property_name&gt;
         &lt;provider_name&gt;.&lt;algorithm_name&gt;.&lt;property_name&gt;

   <b>Properties</b>
       A <u>property</u> is a <u>name=value</u> pair.  A <u>property</u> <u>definition</u> is a sequence of comma separated properties.
       There can be any number of properties in a definition, however each name must be unique.  For example: ""
       defines an empty property definition (i.e., no restriction); "my.foo=bar" defines a property named <u>my.foo</u>
       which has a string value <u>bar</u> and "iteration.count=3" defines a property named <u>iteration.count</u> which has a
       numeric value of <u>3</u>.  The full syntax for property definitions appears below.

   <b>Implementations</b>
       Each implementation of an algorithm can define any number of properties.  For example, the default
       provider defines the property <u>provider=default</u> for all of its algorithms.  Likewise, OpenSSL's FIPS
       provider defines <u>provider=fips</u> and the legacy provider defines <u>provider=legacy</u> for all of their
       algorithms.

   <b>Queries</b>
       A <u>property</u> <u>query</u> <u>clause</u> is a single conditional test.  For example, "fips=yes", "provider!=default" or
       "?iteration.count=3".  The first two represent mandatory clauses, such clauses <b>must</b> match for any
       algorithm to even be under consideration.  The third clause represents an optional clause.  Matching such
       clauses is not a requirement, but any additional optional match counts in favor of the algorithm.  More
       details about that in the <b>Lookups</b> section.  A <u>property</u> <u>query</u> is a sequence of comma separated property
       query clauses.  It is an error if a property name appears in more than one query clause.  The full syntax
       for property queries appears below, but the available syntactic features are:

       •   <b>=</b> is an infix operator providing an equality test.

       •   <b>!=</b> is an infix operator providing an inequality test.

       •   <b>?</b> is a prefix operator that means that the following clause is optional but preferred.

       •   <b>-</b>  is  a  prefix  operator  that  means any global query clause involving the following property name
           should be ignored.

       •   <b>"..."</b> is a quoted string.  The quotes are not included in the body of the string.

       •   <b>'...'</b> is a quoted string.  The quotes are not included in the body of the string.

   <b>Lookups</b>
       When an algorithm is looked up, a property query is used to determine the best matching  algorithm.   All
       mandatory  query  clauses <b>must</b> be present and the implementation that additionally has the largest number
       of matching optional query clauses will be used.  If there is more than one such optimal  candidate,  the
       result  will  be  chosen from amongst those in an indeterminate way.  Ordering of optional clauses is not
       significant.

   <b>Shortcut</b>
       In order to permit a more concise expression of boolean properties, there is one short  cut:  a  property
       name  alone  (e.g.  "my.property")  is  exactly  equivalent  to "my.property=yes" in both definitions and
       queries.

   <b>Global</b> <b>and</b> <b>Local</b>
       Two levels of property query are supported.  A context based property query that  applies  to  all  fetch
       operations  and  a  local property query.  Where both the context and local queries include a clause with
       the same name, the local clause overrides the context clause.

       It is possible for a local property query to remove a clause in the context property query  by  preceding
       the  property  name  with  a  '-'.   For example, a context property query that contains "fips=yes" would
       normally result in implementations that have "fips=yes".

       However, if the setting of the "fips" property is irrelevant to the operations being performed, the local
       property query can include the clause "-fips".   Note  that  the  local  property  query  could  not  use
       "fips=no"  because  that  would disallow any implementations with "fips=yes" rather than not caring about
       the setting.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The lexical syntax in EBNF is given by:

        Definition     ::= PropertyName ( '=' Value )?
                               ( ',' PropertyName ( '=' Value )? )*
        Query          ::= PropertyQuery ( ',' PropertyQuery )*
        PropertyQuery  ::= '-' PropertyName
                         | '?'? ( PropertyName (( '=' | '!=' ) Value)?)
        Value          ::= NumberLiteral | StringLiteral
        StringLiteral  ::= QuotedString | UnquotedString
        QuotedString   ::= '"' [^"]* '"' | "'" [^']* "'"
        UnquotedString ::= [A-Za-z] [^{space},]+
        NumberLiteral  ::= '0' ( [0-7]* | 'x' [0-9A-Fa-f]+ ) | '-'? [1-9] [0-9]+
        PropertyName   ::= [A-Za-z] [A-Za-z0-9_]* ( '.' [A-Za-z] [A-Za-z0-9_]* )*

       The        flavour        of        EBNF        being         used         is         defined         by:
       &lt;https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-xquery-20101214/#EBNFNotation&gt;.
