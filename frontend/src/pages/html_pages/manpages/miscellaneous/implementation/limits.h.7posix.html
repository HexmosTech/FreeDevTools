</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       limits.h — implementation-defined constants

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/limits.h">limits.h</a>&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Some of the functionality described on this reference page extends the ISO C standard. Applications shall
       define the appropriate feature test macro (see the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>2.2</u>,
       <u>The</u> <u>Compilation</u> <u>Environment</u>) to enable the visibility of these symbols in this header.

       Many  of  the symbols listed here are not defined by the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard. Such symbols are not
       shown as CX shaded, except under the heading ``Numerical Limits''.

       The <u>&lt;limits.h&gt;</u> header  shall  define  macros  and  symbolic  constants  for  various  limits.   Different
       categories   of   limits  are  described  below,  representing  various  limits  on  resources  that  the
       implementation imposes on applications.  All macros and symbolic constants defined in this  header  shall
       be suitable for use in <b>#if</b> preprocessing directives.

       Implementations may choose any appropriate value for each limit, provided it is not more restrictive than
       the Minimum Acceptable Values listed below. Symbolic constant names beginning with _POSIX may be found in
       <u>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</u>.

       Applications  should  not  assume  any  particular  value for a limit. To achieve maximum portability, an
       application should not require more resource than the Minimum  Acceptable  Value  quantity.  However,  an
       application  wishing  to avail itself of the full amount of a resource available on an implementation may
       make use of the value given in <u>&lt;limits.h&gt;</u> on that particular implementation,  by  using  the  macros  and
       symbolic  constants  listed  below.  It  should be noted, however, that many of the listed limits are not
       invariant, and at runtime, the value of the limit may differ from those given in  this  header,  for  the
       following reasons:

        *  The limit is pathname-dependent.

        *  The limit differs between the compile and runtime machines.

       For  these  reasons,  an  application  may  use  the  <u>fpathconf</u>(), <u>pathconf</u>(), and <u>sysconf</u>() functions to
       determine the actual value of a limit at runtime.

       The items in the list ending in _MIN give the most  negative  values  that  the  mathematical  types  are
       guaranteed  to  be  capable  of  representing.  Numbers of a more negative value may be supported on some
       implementations, as indicated by the <u>&lt;limits.h&gt;</u> header on the implementation, but applications  requiring
       such  numbers  are not guaranteed to be portable to all implementations. For positive constants ending in
       _MIN, this indicates the minimum acceptable value.

   <b>Runtime</b> <b>Invariant</b> <b>Values</b> <b>(Possibly</b> <b>Indeterminate)</b>
       A definition of one of the symbolic constants in the following list shall be omitted from  <u>&lt;limits.h&gt;</u>  on
       specific  implementations  where  the corresponding value is equal to or greater than the stated minimum,
       but is unspecified.

       This indetermination might depend on the amount of available memory space on a  specific  instance  of  a
       specific  implementation.  The  actual  value  supported  by a specific instance shall be provided by the
       <u>sysconf</u>() function.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       A request was made to reduce the value of {_POSIX_LINK_MAX} from the value of 8 specified for it  in  the
       POSIX.1‐1990 standard to 2. The standard developers decided to deny this request for several reasons:

        *  They wanted to avoid making any changes to the standard that could break conforming applications, and
           the requested change could have that effect.

        *  The  use  of  multiple  hard  links  to  a file cannot always be replaced with use of symbolic links.
           Symbolic links are semantically different from hard links in that  they  associate  a  pathname  with
           another  pathname  rather than a pathname with a file. This has implications for access control, file
           permanence, and transparency.

        *  The original standard developers had considered the issue of allowing for  implementations  that  did
           not in general support hard links, and decided that this would reduce consensus on the standard.

       Systems that support historical versions of the development option of the ISO POSIX‐2 standard retain the
       name {_POSIX2_RE_DUP_MAX} as an alias for {_POSIX_RE_DUP_MAX}.

       {PATH_MAX}
             IEEE PASC Interpretation 1003.1 #15 addressed the inconsistency in the standard with the definition
             of  pathname  and the description of {PATH_MAX}, allowing application developers to allocate either
             {PATH_MAX} or {PATH_MAX}+1  bytes.  The  inconsistency  has  been  removed  by  correction  to  the
             {PATH_MAX} definition to include the null character. With this change, applications that previously
             allocated {PATH_MAX} bytes will continue to succeed.

       {SYMLINK_MAX}
             This  symbol  refers  to space for data that is stored in the file system, as opposed to {PATH_MAX}
             which is the length of a name that can be passed to a function. In some  existing  implementations,
             the  pathnames  pointed  to  by  symbolic  links  are  stored  in the <u>inode</u>s of the links, so it is
             important that {SYMLINK_MAX} not be constrained to be as large as {PATH_MAX}.
