</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       LCRQ - C library implementation of RFC6330 (RaptorQ) for Librecast

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       IP  Multicast is based on UDP, which is inherently unreliable. Packets may arrive out of order, or not at
       all. TCP provides unicast with a reliable messaging layer  on  top  of  this  unreliable,  connectionless
       medium.

       Unicast, however, is one-to-one only. Multicast could, in theory, use all of the same reliability options
       (ACKs etc.) as TCP, at the cost of not being scalable any more.

       Fortunately  there  are  other  ways to achieve similar reliability.  RFC3208 describes Pragmatic General
       Multicast (PGM) based on NAKs (negative acknowledgements). This, too, has scaling issues.

       Forwards Error Correction (FEC) offers us another approach.

       Thanks to parity checking in the network stack, we don't generally need  to  worry  about  errors  within
       packets.  Every packet has a checksum, and if that doesn't match, the packet is dropped before it reaches
       us. Our encryption provides further checking of data <u>received.</u>   We  need  only  concern  ourselves  with
       <u>erasures.</u>  ie. dropped packets.

       RaptorQ is an implementation of a class of systematic erasure codes called <u>fountain</u> <u>codes.</u>

       The  data  we want to send is split into blocks, and then pre-encoded into a set of intermediate symbols.
       From these intermediate symbols we can generate both our original <u>source</u>  symbols,  and  also  additional
       <u>repair</u> symbols.

       Provided  the  recipient receives at least a minimum value K' of these symbols (any unique combination of
       source and repair) the intermediate symbols can be reconstituted, and the original data recovered.

       RaptorQ is what is called a <u>systematic</u> encoding, because the set of symbols we send includes our original
       data as plain text. Provided all source symbols are received, the original data has been transmitted with
       no decoding overhead.  It is only in the case where we need to supplement the source symbols with  repair
       symbols that we must perform the decoding process.

</pre><h4><b>CONFORMING</b> <b>TO</b></h4><pre>
       RFC6330  (IETF)  describes  the  RaptorQ  proposed standard, which LCRQ more-or-less follows. The primary
       focus has been on building a fast, simple and dependency-free FEC implementation for use with  Librecast,
       and not on strict standards compliance. The code does, however, fairly closely follow the RFC.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       There is example code in the <u>examples/</u> directory of the source repository.
