       mpi - LAM/MPI implementation

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       LAM  features  a  full  implementation  of  Message Passing Interface (MPI) 1 standard with many features
       included from the MPI-2 standard.

       Compliant applications are source code portable between LAM and any  other  implementation  of  MPI.   In
       addition  to  meeting the standard in a high quality manner, LAM offers extensive monitoring capabilities
       to support debugging.  Monitoring happens on two levels.  LAM has  the  hooks  to  allow  a  snapshot  of
       process  and  message  status to be taken at any time during an application run.  The status includes all
       aspects of synchronization plus datatype map /  signature,  communicator  group  membership  and  message
       contents.   On  the  second  level,  the  MPI  library  is instrumented to produce a cumulative record of
       communication, which can be visualized either at runtime or post-mortem.

       LAM/MPI features the ability to change its underlying  message  transport  mechanism,  as  well  as  pass
       tunable  parameters  to  different  components in LAM/MPI at run-time -- without the need to recompile or
       relink user MPI applications.  This provides great flexibility for both developers  of  MPI  software  as
       well  as  researchers investigating MPI performance.  This modual framework is called the System Services
       Interface (SSI), and is responsible for much of the back-end functionality in LAM/MPI.

       Another strength of this MPI implementation is  the  movement  of  non-blocking  communication  requests,
       including  those  that  result  from  buffered  sends.   This  is the real challenge of implementing MPI;
       everything else is mostly a straight forward wrapping of  an  underlying  communication  mechanism.   LAM
       allows  messages  to  be  buffered  on  the  source  end in any state of progression, including partially
       transmitted packets.  This capability leads to great portability and robustness.

   <b>User</b> <b>Information</b>
       Users are strongly encouraged to read the  <u>LAM/MPI</u>  <u>User's</u>  <u>Guide</u>  that  is  included  with  the  LAM/MPI
       distribution, and is provided on the main LAM/MPI web site (<u><a href="http://www.lam-mpi.org/">http://www.lam-mpi.org/</a></u>).

   <b>Up-to-Date</b> <b>Information</b>
       The LAM home page can be found on the World Wide Web at: <u><a href="http://www.lam-mpi.org/">http://www.lam-mpi.org/</a></u>.  It should be consulted
       for the most current information about LAM, as well as updates, patches, etc.

   <b>MPI</b> <b>Communication</b>
       The  sophisticated  message  advancing  engine  at  the  heart  of the MPI library uses only a handful of
       routines to drive the underlying communication system.  Runtime flags decide which message passing engine
       module is used, so recompilation of user programs is not necessary.

       The different message passing engines are commonly referred to as "Request Progression  Interface"  (RPI)
       modules.  The LAM/MPI distribution includes multiple RPI modules; see the <a href="../man7/lamssi_rpi.7.html">lamssi_rpi</a>(7) man page for more
       details.

       One  notable  module  uses LAM's network message-passing subsystem, including its buffer daemon.  In this
       "daemon" mode, LAM's extensive monitoring features are  fully  available.   Although  the  "daemon"  mode
       typically  incurrs  higher  latency than the "native" RPI modules, applications that can utilize latency-
       hiding techniques may experience greater performance due to the daemon-mode's  ability  to  exhibit  true
       asynchronous message passing.

   <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>Envelope</b> <b>Resources</b>
       Applications may fail, legitimately, on some implementations but not others due to an escape hatch in the
       MPI  Standard  called  "resource  limitations".  Most resources are managed locally and it is easy for an
       implementation to provide a helpful error code and/or message when a resource is exhausted.  Buffer space
       for message envelopes is often a remote resource (as in LAM) which is difficult to manage.   An  overflow
       may  not  be  reported  (as  in  some  other  implementations)  to  the process that caused the overflow.
       Moreover, interpretation of the MPI guarantee on  message  progress  may  confuse  the  debugging  of  an
       application that actually died on envelope overflow.

       LAM  has  a  property  called  "Guaranteed  Envelope Resources" (GER) which serves two purposes.  It is a
       promise from the implementation to the application that a minimum amount of envelope  buffering  will  be
       available  to  each process pair.  Secondly, it ensures that the producer of messages that overflows this
       resource will be throttled or cited with an error as necessary.

       A minimum GER is configured when LAM is built.  The MPI library  uses  a  protocol  to  ensure  GER  when
       running  in  daemon  mode.   The  default C2C mode (TCP/IP) does not use a protocol, because process-pair
       protection is provided by TCP/IP itself.  Errors are only reported to the receiving process in C2C  mode.
       An option to <a href="../man1/mpirun.1.html">mpirun</a>(1) disables GER.

   <b>Input</b> <b>and</b> <b>Output</b>
       The  MPI  standard  does  not  specify  standard  I/O functionality.  LAM does not interfere with the I/O
       capabilities of the underlying system but it does make special provisions for remote terminal  I/O  using
       the ANSI/POSIX routines.  See <a href="../man1/mpirun.1.html">mpirun</a>(1) and <a href="../man3/tstdio.3.html">tstdio</a>(3).

       LAM  now  includes  the ROMIO distribution for MPI-2 file input and output.  If ROMIO support is compiled
       into LAM, the functionality from Chapter 9 of the MPI-2 standard is provided.

       ROMIO has some important limitations under LAM; the User's  Guide  in  the  LAM  distribution  should  be
       consulted before writing MPI programs that use MPI I/O.

   <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Processes</b>
       LAM includes an implementation of MPI-2 dynamic process creation.

</pre><h4><b>LAM</b> <b>Extensions</b> <b>to</b> <b>MPI</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Debugging</b> <b>Aids</b>
       LAM  includes  the MPI-2 functionality for naming opaque types.  Support for the Etnus TotalView parallel
       debugger is also provided; see the User's Guide for more details.

       Additionally, LAM provides the capability to launch non-MPI programs  on  remote  nodes.   This  includes
       shell scripts, debuggers, etc.  As long as an MPI program is eventually launched (as a child, grandchild,
       etc.),  LAM  can  handle  executing  as  many  intermediate programs as necessary.  This can greatly help
       debugging and logging of user programs.

   <b>Trace</b> <b>Generation</b>
       To avoid being swamped with  trace  data  from  a  long  running  application,  LAM  supplies  collective
       operations to turn the tap on and off.  See <a href="../man2/MPIL_Trace_on.2.html">MPIL_Trace_on</a>(2) and <a href="../man2/MPIL_Trace_off.2.html">MPIL_Trace_off</a>(2).

   <b>Asynchronous</b> <b>Signals</b>
       LAM  has  an signal handling package which mirrors but does not interfere with POSIX signal handling.  An
       MPI extension routine delivers a signal to a process.  See <a href="../man2/MPIL_Signal.2.html">MPIL_Signal</a>(2).
