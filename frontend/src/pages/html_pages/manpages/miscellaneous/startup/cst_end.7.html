       cstartend - cWnn Startup and Termination

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       1.     Startup of cserver
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              To start up cWnn, first, you need to start the cserver.  Type the following command at the C Shell
              prompt:
                   %  cserver  &lt;CR&gt;

              The default path of cserver is "/usr/local/bin/cWnn4/".  If the user has not set this path, he can
              either  set it and type the command directly, or type the full pathname of cserver while executing
              this command.

              cserver will only be started up once.  You may confirm the  existence  of  cserver  by  using  the
              "cwnnstat" command.

       2.     Startup of client module, cuum
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              After starting cserver, the cWnn client module "cuum" may be started up.

              To start "cuum", type the following command at the C Shell prompt of a Chinese window:
                   %  cuum  &lt;CR&gt;

              To  activate  other input environments, you may use the "-r" option of the "cuum" command together
              with the default path of that environment.  For example, to activate Pinyin input environment,  do
              the following:
                   %  cuum  -r  /usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/rk_p  &lt;CR&gt;

              The default path for "cuum" is
              "/usr/local/bin/cWnn4/".   Many cuum's may be started at the same time on different windows.  Each
              of them will be registered as a client at the cserver.

              After a startup message, the client module, cuum, is ready to be used.  To enter the  input  mode,
              press ^\.
              To leave the input mode, press ^\ again.
              To confirm the existence of cuum, you may also use ^\.

       3.     Termination of cuum
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              In order to terminate a client process, press ^D.

              The  cserver will save all the usage frequency files and dictionaries of the particular client and
              terminate the connection between itself and that client.

       4.     Termination of cserver
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              To terminate the cserver, type the following command:
                    % cwnnkill  &lt;CR&gt;

              If some other clients still exist, a message will  be  displayed.   In  this  case,  you  have  to
              termiante all other client modules before you can terminate the cserver.
