</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bash-builtins - bash built-in commands, see <b><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a></b>(1)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       bash  defines  the  following  built-in  commands:  :,  .,  [, alias, bg, bind, break, builtin, case, cd,
       command, compgen, complete, continue, declare, dirs, disown, echo, enable, eval, exec, exit, export,  fc,
       fg,  getopts,  hash,  help,  history, if, jobs, kill, let, local, logout, popd, printf, pushd, pwd, read,
       readonly, return, set, shift, shopt, source, suspend, test, times, trap, type,  typeset,  ulimit,  umask,
       unalias, unset, until, wait, while.

</pre><h4><b>BASH</b> <b>BUILTIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Unless  otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this section as accepting options preceded by
       <b>-</b> accepts <b>--</b> to signify the end of the options.  The <b>:</b>, <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>, and <b>test</b>/<b>[</b> builtins  do  not  accept
       options  and  do  not  treat  <b>--</b>  specially.   The  <b>exit</b>, <b>logout</b>, <b>return</b>, <b>break</b>, <b>continue</b>, <b>let</b>, and <b>shift</b>
       builtins accept and process arguments beginning with <b>-</b> without requiring <b>--</b>.  Other builtins that  accept
       arguments  but  are  not  specified  as accepting options interpret arguments beginning with <b>-</b> as invalid
       options and require <b>--</b> to prevent this interpretation.
       <b>:</b> [<u>arguments</u>]
              No effect; the command does nothing  beyond  expanding  <u>arguments</u>  and  performing  any  specified
              redirections.  The return status is zero.

        <b>.</b>  <u>filename</u> [<u>arguments</u>]
       <b>source</b> <u>filename</u> [<u>arguments</u>]
              Read  and  execute  commands  from  <u>filename</u>  in the current shell environment and return the exit
              status of the last command executed  from  <u>filename</u>.   If  <u>filename</u>  does  not  contain  a  slash,
              filenames  in  <b>PATH</b> are used to find the directory containing <u>filename</u>, but <u>filename</u> does not need
              to be executable.  The file searched for in <b>PATH</b> need not be executable.   When  <b>bash</b>  is  not  in
              <u>posix</u>  <u>mode</u>,  it  searches  the  current directory if no file is found in <b>PATH</b>.  If the <b>sourcepath</b>
              option to the <b>shopt</b> builtin command is turned off, the <b>PATH</b> is not searched.  If any <u>arguments</u> are
              supplied, they become  the  positional  parameters  when  <u>filename</u>  is  executed.   Otherwise  the
              positional  parameters  are unchanged.  If the <b>-T</b> option is enabled, <b>.</b> inherits any trap on <b>DEBUG</b>;
              if it is not, any <b>DEBUG</b> trap string is saved and restored around the call to <b>.</b>, and <b>.</b>  unsets  the
              <b>DEBUG</b>  trap while it executes.  If <b>-T</b> is not set, and the sourced file changes the <b>DEBUG</b> trap, the
              new value is retained when <b>.</b> completes.  The return status is  the  status  of  the  last  command
              exited  within  the  script (0 if no commands are executed), and false if <u>filename</u> is not found or
              cannot be read.

       <b>alias</b> [<b>-p</b>] [<u>name</u>[=<u>value</u>] ...]
              <b>Alias</b> with no arguments or with the <b>-p</b> option prints  the  list  of  aliases  in  the  form  <b>alias</b>
              <u>name</u>=<u>value</u>  on  standard  output.   When arguments are supplied, an alias is defined for each <u>name</u>
              whose <u>value</u> is given.  A trailing space in <u>value</u> causes the next word  to  be  checked  for  alias
              substitution when the alias is expanded.  For each <u>name</u> in the argument list for which no <u>value</u> is
              supplied,  the  name and value of the alias is printed.  <b>Alias</b> returns true unless a <u>name</u> is given
              for which no alias has been defined.

       <b>bg</b> [<u>jobspec</u> ...]
              Resume each suspended job <u>jobspec</u> in the background, as if it had been started with <b>&amp;</b>.  If <u>jobspec</u>
              is not present, the shell's notion of the <u>current</u> <u>job</u> is used.  <b>bg</b> <u>jobspec</u> returns  0  unless  run
              when  job control is disabled or, when run with job control enabled, any specified <u>jobspec</u> was not
              found or was started without job control.

       <b>bind</b> [<b>-m</b> <u>keymap</u>] [<b>-lpsvPSVX</b>]
       <b>bind</b> [<b>-m</b> <u>keymap</u>] [<b>-q</b> <u>function</u>] [<b>-u</b> <u>function</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>keyseq</u>]
       <b>bind</b> [<b>-m</b> <u>keymap</u>] <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>
       <b>bind</b> [<b>-m</b> <u>keymap</u>] <b>-x</b> <u>keyseq</u>:<u>shell-command</u>
       <b>bind</b> [<b>-m</b> <u>keymap</u>] <u>keyseq</u>:<u>function-name</u>
       <b>bind</b> [<b>-m</b> <u>keymap</u>] <u>keyseq</u>:<u>readline-command</u>
       <b>bind</b> <u>readline-command-line</u>
              Display current <b>readline</b> key and function bindings, bind a key sequence to a <b>readline</b> function  or
              macro,  or set a <b>readline</b> variable.  Each non-option argument is a command as it would appear in a
              <b>readline</b> initialization file such as <u>.inputrc</u>, but each binding or command must  be  passed  as  a
              separate  argument;  e.g.,  '"\C-x\C-r":  re-read-init-file'.   Options,  if  supplied,  have  the
              following meanings:
              <b>-m</b> <u>keymap</u>
                     Use <u>keymap</u> as the keymap to be affected by  the  subsequent  bindings.   Acceptable  <u>keymap</u>
                     names  are  <u>emacs,</u>  <u>emacs-standard,</u>  <u>emacs-meta,</u>  <u>emacs-ctlx,</u>  <u>vi,</u> <u>vi-move,</u> <u>vi-command</u>, and
                     <u>vi-insert</u>.  <u>vi</u> is equivalent to <u>vi-command</u> (<u>vi-move</u> is also a synonym); <u>emacs</u> is equivalent
                     to <u>emacs-standard</u>.
              <b>-l</b>     List the names of all <b>readline</b> functions.
              <b>-p</b>     Display <b>readline</b> function names and bindings in such a way that they can be re-read.
              <b>-P</b>     List current <b>readline</b> function names and bindings.
              <b>-s</b>     Display <b>readline</b> key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output in  such  a  way
                     that they can be re-read.
              <b>-S</b>     Display <b>readline</b> key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output.
              <b>-v</b>     Display <b>readline</b> variable names and values in such a way that they can be re-read.
              <b>-V</b>     List current <b>readline</b> variable names and values.
              <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>
                     Read key bindings from <u>filename</u>.
              <b>-q</b> <u>function</u>
                     Query about which keys invoke the named <u>function</u>.
              <b>-u</b> <u>function</u>
                     Unbind all keys bound to the named <u>function</u>.
              <b>-r</b> <u>keyseq</u>
                     Remove any current binding for <u>keyseq</u>.
              <b>-x</b> <u>keyseq</u><b>:</b><u>shell-command</u>
                     Cause  <u>shell-command</u>  to  be  executed  whenever  <u>keyseq</u> is entered.  When <u>shell-command</u> is
                     executed, the shell sets the <b>READLINE_LINE</b> variable to the contents of  the  <b>readline</b>  line
                     buffer  and  the  <b>READLINE_POINT</b> and <b>READLINE_MARK</b> variables to the current location of the
                     insertion point and the saved insertion point (the mark), respectively.  The shell  assigns
                     any  numeric argument the user supplied to the <b>READLINE_ARGUMENT</b> variable.  If there was no
                     argument, that variable is not set.  If the executed command changes the value  of  any  of
                     <b>READLINE_LINE</b>,  <b>READLINE_POINT</b>, or <b>READLINE_MARK</b>, those new values will be reflected in the
                     editing state.
              <b>-X</b>     List all key sequences bound to shell commands and the associated commands in a format that
                     can be reused as input.

              The return value is 0 unless an unrecognized option is given or an error occurred.

       <b>break</b> [<u>n</u>]
              Exit from within a <b>for</b>, <b>while</b>, <b>until</b>, or <b>select</b> loop.  If <u>n</u> is specified, break <u>n</u> levels.  <u>n</u>  must
              be  â‰¥ 1.  If <u>n</u> is greater than the number of enclosing loops, all enclosing loops are exited.  The
              return value is 0 unless <u>n</u> is not greater than or equal to 1.

       <b>builtin</b> <u>shell-builtin</u> [<u>arguments</u>]
              Execute the specified shell builtin, passing it <u>arguments</u>, and return its exit  status.   This  is
              useful  when  defining  a  function  whose  name  is  the  same  as a shell builtin, retaining the
              functionality of the builtin within the function.  The <b>cd</b> builtin is commonly redefined this  way.
              The return status is false if <u>shell-builtin</u> is not a shell builtin command.

       <b>caller</b> [<u>expr</u>]
              Returns  the context of any active subroutine call (a shell function or a script executed with the
              <b>.</b> or <b>source</b> builtins).  Without <u>expr</u>, <b>caller</b> displays the line number and source filename  of  the
              current  subroutine call.  If a non-negative integer is supplied as <u>expr</u>, <b>caller</b> displays the line
              number, subroutine name, and source file corresponding to that position in the  current  execution
              call stack.  This extra information may be used, for example, to print a stack trace.  The current
              frame  is  frame  0.  The return value is 0 unless the shell is not executing a subroutine call or
              <u>expr</u> does not correspond to a valid position in the call stack.

       <b>cd</b> [<b>-L</b>|[<b>-P</b> [<b>-e</b>]] [-@]] [<u>dir</u>]
              Change the current directory to <u>dir</u>.  if <u>dir</u> is not supplied, the value of the <b>HOME</b> shell variable
              is the default.  The variable <b>CDPATH</b> defines the search path for  the  directory  containing  <u>dir</u>:
              each  directory  name  in  <b>CDPATH</b>  is searched for <u>dir</u>.  Alternative directory names in <b>CDPATH</b> are
              separated by a colon (:).  A null directory name in <b>CDPATH</b> is the same as the  current  directory,
              i.e., ``<b>.</b>''.  If <u>dir</u> begins with a slash (/), then <b>CDPATH</b> is not used.  The <b>-P</b> option causes <b>cd</b> to
              use  the  physical directory structure by resolving symbolic links while traversing <u>dir</u> and before
              processing instances of <u>..</u> in <u>dir</u> (see also the <b>-P</b> option to the  <b>set</b>  builtin  command);  the  <b>-L</b>
              option forces symbolic links to be followed by resolving the link after processing instances of <u>..</u>
              in  <u>dir</u>.   If  <u>..</u>  appears  in  <u>dir</u>, it is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname
              component from <u>dir</u>, back to a slash or the beginning of <u>dir</u>.  If the <b>-e</b> option  is  supplied  with
              <b>-P</b>,  and  the  current  working  directory  cannot  be  successfully determined after a successful
              directory change, <b>cd</b> will return an unsuccessful status.  On  systems  that  support  it,  the  <b>-@</b>
              option  presents  the extended attributes associated with a file as a directory.  An argument of <b>-</b>
              is converted to <b>$OLDPWD</b> before the directory change is attempted.  If a non-empty  directory  name
              from  <b>CDPATH</b>  is  used, or if <b>-</b> is the first argument, and the directory change is successful, the
              absolute pathname of the new working  directory  is  written  to  the  standard  output.   If  the
              directory  change  is  successful,  <b>cd</b>  sets  the value of the <b>PWD</b> environment variable to the new
              directory name, and sets the <b>OLDPWD</b> environment variable to  the  value  of  the  current  working
              directory  before the change.  The return value is true if the directory was successfully changed;
              false otherwise.

       <b>command</b> [<b>-pVv</b>] <u>command</u> [<u>arg</u> ...]
              Run <u>command</u> with <u>args</u> suppressing the normal shell function  lookup.   Only  builtin  commands  or
              commands  found  in  the  <b>PATH</b> are executed.  If the <b>-p</b> option is given, the search for <u>command</u> is
              performed using a default value for <b>PATH</b> that is guaranteed to find all of the standard utilities.
              If either the <b>-V</b> or <b>-v</b> option is supplied, a description of <u>command</u> is  printed.   The  <b>-v</b>  option
              causes  a  single  word indicating the command or filename used to invoke <u>command</u> to be displayed;
              the <b>-V</b> option produces a more verbose description.  If the <b>-V</b> or <b>-v</b> option is supplied,  the  exit
              status  is  0  if  <u>command</u>  was  found,  and 1 if not.  If neither option is supplied and an error
              occurred or <u>command</u> cannot be found, the exit status is 127.  Otherwise, the exit  status  of  the
              <b>command</b> builtin is the exit status of <u>command</u>.

       <b>compgen</b> [<u>option</u>] [<u>word</u>]
              Generate  possible  completion  matches for <u>word</u> according to the <u>option</u>s, which may be any option
              accepted by the <b>complete</b> builtin with the exception of <b>-p</b> and <b>-r</b>, and write  the  matches  to  the
              standard  output.   When  using  the  <b>-F</b>  or  <b>-C</b>  options,  the various shell variables set by the
              programmable completion facilities, while available, will not have useful values.

              The matches will be generated in the same way as if the programmable completion code had generated
              them directly from a completion specification with the same flags.  If  <u>word</u>  is  specified,  only
              those completions matching <u>word</u> will be displayed.

              The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, or no matches were generated.

       <b>complete</b> [<b>-abcdefgjksuv</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>comp-option</u>] [<b>-DEI</b>] [<b>-A</b> <u>action</u>] [<b>-G</b> <u>globpat</u>] [<b>-W</b> <u>wordlist</u>]
              [<b>-F</b> <u>function</u>] [<b>-C</b> <u>command</u>] [<b>-X</b> <u>filterpat</u>] [<b>-P</b> <u>prefix</u>] [<b>-S</b> <u>suffix</u>] <u>name</u> [<u>name</u> <u>...</u>]
       <b>complete</b> <b>-pr</b> [<b>-DEI</b>] [<u>name</u> ...]
              Specify  how  arguments  to each <u>name</u> should be completed.  If the <b>-p</b> option is supplied, or if no
              options are supplied, existing completion specifications are printed in a way that allows them  to
              be  reused  as  input.   The <b>-r</b> option removes a completion specification for each <u>name</u>, or, if no
              <u>name</u>s are supplied, all completion specifications.  The <b>-D</b> option indicates  that  other  supplied
              options  and  actions  should  apply  to  the  ``default'' command completion; that is, completion
              attempted on a command for which no  completion  has  previously  been  defined.   The  <b>-E</b>  option
              indicates  that  other  supplied options and actions should apply to ``empty'' command completion;
              that is, completion attempted on a blank line.   The  <b>-I</b>  option  indicates  that  other  supplied
              options  and actions should apply to completion on the initial non-assignment word on the line, or
              after a command delimiter such as <b>;</b> or <b>|</b>, which is usually command name completion.   If  multiple
              options  are  supplied,  the <b>-D</b> option takes precedence over <b>-E</b>, and both take precedence over <b>-I</b>.
              If any of <b>-D</b>, <b>-E</b>, or <b>-I</b> are supplied, any other <u>name</u> arguments are ignored; these completions only
              apply to the case specified by the option.

              The process of applying these completion specifications  when  word  completion  is  attempted  is
              described in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>.

              Other  options,  if  specified,  have the following meanings.  The arguments to the <b>-G</b>, <b>-W</b>, and <b>-X</b>
              options (and, if necessary, the <b>-P</b> and <b>-S</b> options) should be quoted to protect them from expansion
              before the <b>complete</b> builtin is invoked.
              <b>-o</b> <u>comp-option</u>
                      The <u>comp-option</u> controls several aspects of the  compspec's  behavior  beyond  the  simple
                      generation of completions.  <u>comp-option</u> may be one of:
                      <b>bashdefault</b>
                              Perform  the  rest  of  the  default <b>bash</b> completions if the compspec generates no
                              matches.
                      <b>default</b> Use readline's default filename completion if the compspec generates no matches.
                      <b>dirnames</b>
                              Perform directory name completion if the compspec generates no matches.
                      <b>filenames</b>
                              Tell readline that the  compspec  generates  filenames,  so  it  can  perform  any
                              filename-specific  processing  (like  adding  a  slash to directory names, quoting
                              special characters, or suppressing trailing spaces).  Intended  to  be  used  with
                              shell functions.
                      <b>noquote</b> Tell  readline  not  to  quote  the completed words if they are filenames (quoting
                              filenames is the default).
                      <b>nosort</b>  Tell readline not to sort the list of possible completions alphabetically.
                      <b>nospace</b> Tell readline not to append a space (the default) to words completed at the end of
                              the line.
                      <b>plusdirs</b>
                              After any matches defined by the compspec are generated, directory name completion
                              is attempted and any matches are added to the results of the other actions.
              <b>-A</b> <u>action</u>
                      The <u>action</u> may be one of the following to generate a list of possible completions:
                      <b>alias</b>   Alias names.  May also be specified as <b>-a</b>.
                      <b>arrayvar</b>
                              Array variable names.
                      <b>binding</b> <b>Readline</b> key binding names.
                      <b>builtin</b> Names of shell builtin commands.  May also be specified as <b>-b</b>.
                      <b>command</b> Command names.  May also be specified as <b>-c</b>.
                      <b>directory</b>
                              Directory names.  May also be specified as <b>-d</b>.
                      <b>disabled</b>
                              Names of disabled shell builtins.
                      <b>enabled</b> Names of enabled shell builtins.
                      <b>export</b>  Names of exported shell variables.  May also be specified as <b>-e</b>.
                      <b>file</b>    File names.  May also be specified as <b>-f</b>.
                      <b>function</b>
                              Names of shell functions.
                      <b>group</b>   Group names.  May also be specified as <b>-g</b>.
                      <b>helptopic</b>
                              Help topics as accepted by the <b>help</b> builtin.
                      <b>hostname</b>
                              Hostnames, as taken from the file specified by the <b>HOSTFILE</b> shell variable.
                      <b>job</b>     Job names, if job control is active.  May also be specified as <b>-j</b>.
                      <b>keyword</b> Shell reserved words.  May also be specified as <b>-k</b>.
                      <b>running</b> Names of running jobs, if job control is active.
                      <b>service</b> Service names.  May also be specified as <b>-s</b>.

                      <b>shopt</b>   Shell option names as accepted by the <b>shopt</b> builtin.
                      <b>signal</b>  Signal names.
                      <b>stopped</b> Names of stopped jobs, if job control is active.
                      <b>user</b>    User names.  May also be specified as <b>-u</b>.
                      <b>variable</b>
                              Names of all shell variables.  May also be specified as <b>-v</b>.
              <b>-C</b> <u>command</u>
                      <u>command</u> is executed in a subshell environment, and its output  is  used  as  the  possible
                      completions.  Arguments are passed as with the <b>-F</b> option.
              <b>-F</b> <u>function</u>
                      The  shell  function  <u>function</u>  is  executed  in  the current shell environment.  When the
                      function is executed, the first argument (<b>$1</b>) is the name of the command  whose  arguments
                      are  being  completed, the second argument (<b>$2</b>) is the word being completed, and the third
                      argument (<b>$3</b>) is the word preceding the word being completed on the current command  line.
                      When  it  finishes, the possible completions are retrieved from the value of the <b>COMPREPLY</b>
                      array variable.
              <b>-G</b> <u>globpat</u>
                      The pathname expansion pattern <u>globpat</u> is expanded to generate the possible completions.
              <b>-P</b> <u>prefix</u>
                      <u>prefix</u> is added at the beginning of each possible completion after all other options  have
                      been applied.
              <b>-S</b> <u>suffix</u>
                      <u>suffix</u> is appended to each possible completion after all other options have been applied.
              <b>-W</b> <u>wordlist</u>
                      The  <u>wordlist</u> is split using the characters in the <b>IFS</b> special variable as delimiters, and
                      each resultant word is expanded.  Shell quoting is honored within <u>wordlist</u>,  in  order  to
                      provide  a  mechanism  for  the words to contain shell metacharacters or characters in the
                      value of <b>IFS</b>.  The possible completions are the members of the resultant list which  match
                      the word being completed.
              <b>-X</b> <u>filterpat</u>
                      <u>filterpat</u>  is  a  pattern  as  used  for pathname expansion.  It is applied to the list of
                      possible completions generated by the preceding options and arguments, and each completion
                      matching <u>filterpat</u> is removed from the  list.   A  leading  <b>!</b>  in  <u>filterpat</u>  negates  the
                      pattern; in this case, any completion not matching <u>filterpat</u> is removed.

              The  return  value  is true unless an invalid option is supplied, an option other than <b>-p</b> or <b>-r</b> is
              supplied without a <u>name</u> argument, an attempt is made to remove a completion  specification  for  a
              <u>name</u> for which no specification exists, or an error occurs adding a completion specification.

       <b>compopt</b> [<b>-o</b> <u>option</u>] [<b>-DEI</b>] [<b>+o</b> <u>option</u>] [<u>name</u>]
              Modify  completion  options for each <u>name</u> according to the <u>option</u>s, or for the currently-executing
              completion if no <u>name</u>s are supplied.  If no <u>option</u>s are given, display the completion options  for
              each  <u>name</u>  or  the  current  completion.   The  possible values of <u>option</u> are those valid for the
              <b>complete</b> builtin described above.  The <b>-D</b> option indicates  that  other  supplied  options  should
              apply  to the ``default'' command completion; that is, completion attempted on a command for which
              no completion has previously been defined.  The <b>-E</b> option indicates that  other  supplied  options
              should  apply to ``empty'' command completion; that is, completion attempted on a blank line.  The
              <b>-I</b> option indicates that other supplied options should apply to completion  on  the  initial  non-
              assignment word on the line, or after a command delimiter such as <b>;</b> or <b>|</b>, which is usually command
              name completion.

              The  return  value  is true unless an invalid option is supplied, an attempt is made to modify the
              options for a <u>name</u> for which no completion specification exists, or an output error occurs.

       <b>continue</b> [<u>n</u>]
              Resume the next iteration of the enclosing <b>for</b>, <b>while</b>, <b>until</b>, or <b>select</b> loop.  If <u>n</u> is  specified,
              resume  at  the  <u>n</u>th enclosing loop.  <u>n</u> must be â‰¥ 1.  If <u>n</u> is greater than the number of enclosing
              loops, the last enclosing loop (the ``top-level'' loop) is resumed.  The return value is 0  unless
              <u>n</u> is not greater than or equal to 1.

       <b>declare</b> [<b>-aAfFgiIlnrtux</b>] [<b>-p</b>] [<u>name</u>[=<u>value</u>] ...]
       <b>typeset</b> [<b>-aAfFgiIlnrtux</b>] [<b>-p</b>] [<u>name</u>[=<u>value</u>] ...]
              Declare  variables  and/or give them attributes.  If no <u>name</u>s are given then display the values of
              variables.  The <b>-p</b> option will display the attributes and values of each <u>name</u>.  When  <b>-p</b>  is  used
              with  <u>name</u>  arguments, additional options, other than <b>-f</b> and <b>-F</b>, are ignored.  When <b>-p</b> is supplied
              without <u>name</u> arguments, it will display the attributes and values  of  all  variables  having  the
              attributes specified by the additional options.  If no other options are supplied with <b>-p</b>, <b>declare</b>
              will  display  the  attributes and values of all shell variables.  The <b>-f</b> option will restrict the
              display to shell functions.  The <b>-F</b> option inhibits the display of function definitions; only  the
              function  name  and  attributes are printed.  If the <b>extdebug</b> shell option is enabled using <b>shopt</b>,
              the source file name and line number where each <u>name</u> is defined are displayed  as  well.   The  <b>-F</b>
              option  implies <b>-f</b>.  The <b>-g</b> option forces variables to be created or modified at the global scope,
              even when <b>declare</b> is executed in a shell function.  It is ignored in  all  other  cases.   The  <b>-I</b>
              option  causes  local variables to inherit the attributes (except the <u>nameref</u> attribute) and value
              of any existing variable with the same <u>name</u> at a surrounding  scope.   If  there  is  no  existing
              variable,  the  local  variable is initially unset.  The following options can be used to restrict
              output to variables with the specified attribute or to give variables attributes:
              <b>-a</b>     Each <u>name</u> is an indexed array variable (see <b>Arrays</b> in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>).
              <b>-A</b>     Each <u>name</u> is an associative array variable (see <b>Arrays</b> in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>).
              <b>-f</b>     Use function names only.
              <b>-i</b>     The variable is treated as an integer; arithmetic evaluation (see <b>ARITHMETIC</b> <b>EVALUATION</b>  in
                     <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>) is performed when the variable is assigned a value.
              <b>-l</b>     When  the  variable  is assigned a value, all upper-case characters are converted to lower-
                     case.  The upper-case attribute is disabled.
              <b>-n</b>     Give each <u>name</u> the <u>nameref</u> attribute, making it a name reference to another variable.  That
                     other variable is defined by the value of <u>name</u>.  All references, assignments, and attribute
                     modifications to <u>name</u>, except  those  using  or  changing  the  <b>-n</b>  attribute  itself,  are
                     performed  on  the  variable  referenced  by <u>name</u>'s value.  The nameref attribute cannot be
                     applied to array variables.
              <b>-r</b>     Make <u>name</u>s readonly.  These names cannot then be assigned values by  subsequent  assignment
                     statements or unset.
              <b>-t</b>     Give  each  <u>name</u>  the <u>trace</u> attribute.  Traced functions inherit the <b>DEBUG</b> and <b>RETURN</b> traps
                     from the calling shell.  The trace attribute has no special meaning for variables.
              <b>-u</b>     When the variable is assigned a value, all lower-case characters are  converted  to  upper-
                     case.  The lower-case attribute is disabled.
              <b>-x</b>     Mark <u>name</u>s for export to subsequent commands via the environment.

              Using  `+'  instead of `-' turns off the attribute instead, with the exceptions that <b>+a</b> and <b>+A</b> may
              not be used to destroy array variables and <b>+r</b> will not remove the readonly attribute.   When  used
              in  a function, <b>declare</b> and <b>typeset</b> make each <u>name</u> local, as with the <b>local</b> command, unless the <b>-g</b>
              option is supplied.  If a variable name is followed by =<u>value</u>, the value of the variable is set to
              <u>value</u>.  When using <b>-a</b> or <b>-A</b>  and  the  compound  assignment  syntax  to  create  array  variables,
              additional  attributes  do  not  take  effect until subsequent assignments.  The return value is 0
              unless an invalid option is encountered, an attempt is  made  to  define  a  function  using  ``-f
              foo=bar'',  an  attempt  is  made  to assign a value to a readonly variable, an attempt is made to
              assign a value to an array variable without using the compound assignment syntax  (see  <b>Arrays</b>  in
              <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>),  one  of  the  <u>names</u>  is not a valid shell variable name, an attempt is made to turn off
              readonly status for a readonly variable, an attempt is made to turn off array status for an  array
              variable, or an attempt is made to display a non-existent function with <b>-f</b>.

       <b>dirs</b> <b>[-clpv]</b> <b>[+</b><u>n</u><b>]</b> <b>[-</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>
              Without options, displays the list of currently remembered directories.  The default display is on
              a  single  line  with directory names separated by spaces.  Directories are added to the list with
              the <b>pushd</b> command; the <b>popd</b> command removes entries from  the  list.   The  current  directory  is
              always the first directory in the stack.
              <b>-c</b>     Clears the directory stack by deleting all of the entries.
              <b>-l</b>     Produces  a listing using full pathnames; the default listing format uses a tilde to denote
                     the home directory.
              <b>-p</b>     Print the directory stack with one entry per line.
              <b>-v</b>     Print the directory stack with one entry per line, prefixing each entry with its  index  in
                     the stack.
              <b>+</b><u>n</u>     Displays  the  <u>n</u>th  entry  counting  from  the  left of the list shown by <b>dirs</b> when invoked
                     without options, starting with zero.
              <b>-</b><u>n</u>     Displays the <u>n</u>th entry counting from the right of the  list  shown  by  <b>dirs</b>  when  invoked
                     without options, starting with zero.

              The  return  value  is  0  unless an invalid option is supplied or <u>n</u> indexes beyond the end of the
              directory stack.

       <b>disown</b> [<b>-ar</b>] [<b>-h</b>] [<u>jobspec</u> ... | <u>pid</u> ... ]
              Without options, remove each <u>jobspec</u> from the table of active jobs.  If <u>jobspec</u>  is  not  present,
              and  neither  the  <b>-a</b> nor the <b>-r</b> option is supplied, the <u>current</u> <u>job</u> is used.  If the <b>-h</b> option is
              given, each <u>jobspec</u> is not removed from the table, but is marked so that <b>SIGHUP</b> is not sent to the
              job if the shell receives a <b>SIGHUP</b>.  If no <u>jobspec</u> is supplied, the <b>-a</b> option means to  remove  or
              mark  all jobs; the <b>-r</b> option without a <u>jobspec</u> argument restricts operation to running jobs.  The
              return value is 0 unless a <u>jobspec</u> does not specify a valid job.

       <b>echo</b> [<b>-neE</b>] [<u>arg</u> ...]
              Output the <u>arg</u>s, separated by spaces, followed by a newline.  The return  status  is  0  unless  a
              write  error occurs.  If <b>-n</b> is specified, the trailing newline is suppressed.  If the <b>-e</b> option is
              given, interpretation of the following backslash-escaped characters is  enabled.   The  <b>-E</b>  option
              disables the interpretation of these escape characters, even on systems where they are interpreted
              by  default.   The  <b>xpg_echo</b> shell option may be used to dynamically determine whether or not <b>echo</b>
              expands these escape characters by default.  <b>echo</b> does  not  interpret  <b>--</b>  to  mean  the  end  of
              options.  <b>echo</b> interprets the following escape sequences:
              <b>\a</b>     alert (bell)
              <b>\b</b>     backspace
              <b>\c</b>     suppress further output
              <b>\e</b>
              <b>\E</b>     an escape character
              <b>\f</b>     form feed
              <b>\n</b>     new line
              <b>\r</b>     carriage return
              <b>\t</b>     horizontal tab
              <b>\v</b>     vertical tab
              <b>\\</b>     backslash
              <b>\0</b><u>nnn</u>  the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value <u>nnn</u> (zero to three octal digits)
              <b>\x</b><u>HH</u>   the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value <u>HH</u> (one or two hex digits)
              <b>\u</b><u>HHHH</u> the  Unicode  (ISO/IEC  10646)  character whose value is the hexadecimal value <u>HHHH</u> (one to
                     four hex digits)
              <b>\U</b><u>HHHHHHHH</u>
                     the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value <u>HHHHHHHH</u> (one to
                     eight hex digits)

       <b>enable</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-dnps</b>] [<b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>] [<u>name</u> ...]
              Enable and disable builtin shell commands.  Disabling a builtin allows a disk  command  which  has
              the  same  name  as a shell builtin to be executed without specifying a full pathname, even though
              the shell normally searches for builtins before disk commands.   If  <b>-n</b>  is  used,  each  <u>name</u>  is
              disabled;  otherwise,  <u>names</u>  are enabled.  For example, to use the <b>test</b> binary found via the <b>PATH</b>
              instead of the shell builtin version, run ``enable -n test''.  The <b>-f</b> option means to load the new
              builtin command <u>name</u> from shared object <u>filename</u>, on systems that support dynamic  loading.   Bash
              will use the value of the <b>BASH_LOADABLES_PATH</b> variable as a colon-separated list of directories in
              which  to  search  for  <u>filename</u>.   The  default is system-dependent.  The <b>-d</b> option will delete a
              builtin previously loaded with <b>-f</b>.  If no <u>name</u> arguments  are  given,  or  if  the  <b>-p</b>  option  is
              supplied,  a list of shell builtins is printed.  With no other option arguments, the list consists
              of all enabled shell builtins.  If <b>-n</b> is supplied, only disabled builtins are printed.  If  <b>-a</b>  is
              supplied,  the  list  printed  includes all builtins, with an indication of whether or not each is
              enabled.  If <b>-s</b> is supplied, the output is restricted  to  the  POSIX  <u>special</u>  builtins.   If  no
              options  are  supplied  and a <u>name</u> is not a shell builtin, <b>enable</b> will attempt to load <u>name</u> from a
              shared object named <u>name</u>, as if the command were ``enable -f <u>name</u> <u>name</u> .  The return  value  is  0
              unless  a  <u>name</u>  is  not  a shell builtin or there is an error loading a new builtin from a shared
              object.

       <b>eval</b> [<u>arg</u> ...]
              The <u>arg</u>s are read and concatenated together into a single command.  This command is then read  and
              executed  by  the  shell,  and  its exit status is returned as the value of <b>eval</b>.  If there are no
              <u>args</u>, or only null arguments, <b>eval</b> returns 0.

       <b>exec</b> [<b>-cl</b>] [<b>-a</b> <u>name</u>] [<u>command</u> [<u>arguments</u>]]
              If <u>command</u> is specified, it replaces the shell.  No new process is created.  The <u>arguments</u>  become
              the  arguments to <u>command</u>.  If the <b>-l</b> option is supplied, the shell places a dash at the beginning
              of the zeroth argument passed to <u>command</u>.  This is what  <u><a href="../man1/login.1.html">login</a></u>(1)  does.   The  <b>-c</b>  option  causes
              <u>command</u> to be executed with an empty environment.  If <b>-a</b> is supplied, the shell passes <u>name</u> as the
              zeroth  argument  to  the executed command.  If <u>command</u> cannot be executed for some reason, a non-
              interactive shell exits, unless the <b>execfail</b> shell option is enabled.  In that  case,  it  returns
              failure.   An  interactive shell returns failure if the file cannot be executed.  A subshell exits
              unconditionally if <b>exec</b> fails.  If <u>command</u> is not specified, any redirections take effect  in  the
              current  shell, and the return status is 0.  If there is a redirection error, the return status is
              1.

       <b>exit</b> [<u>n</u>]
              Cause the shell to exit with a status of <u>n</u>.  If <u>n</u> is omitted, the exit status is that of the  last
              command executed.  A trap on <b>EXIT</b> is executed before the shell terminates.

       <b>export</b> [<b>-fn</b>] [<u>name</u>[=<u>word</u>]] ...
       <b>export</b> <b>-p</b>
              The  supplied  <u>names</u>  are  marked for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed
              commands.  If the <b>-f</b> option is given, the <u>names</u> refer to functions.  If no <u>names</u> are given, or  if
              the  <b>-p</b>  option  is supplied, a list of names of all exported variables is printed.  The <b>-n</b> option
              causes the export property to be removed from each <u>name</u>.  If a variable name is followed by =<u>word</u>,
              the value of the variable is set to <u>word</u>.  <b>export</b> returns an exit status of 0  unless  an  invalid
              option is encountered, one of the <u>names</u> is not a valid shell variable name, or <b>-f</b> is supplied with
              a <u>name</u> that is not a function.

       <b>fc</b> [<b>-e</b> <u>ename</u>] [<b>-lnr</b>] [<u>first</u>] [<u>last</u>]
       <b>fc</b> <b>-s</b> [<u>pat</u>=<u>rep</u>] [<u>cmd</u>]
              The  first  form selects a range of commands from <u>first</u> to <u>last</u> from the history list and displays
              or edits and re-executes them.  <u>First</u> and <u>last</u> may be specified as a string (to  locate  the  last
              command  beginning  with  that  string)  or  as  a number (an index into the history list, where a
              negative number is used as an offset from the current command number).  When listing, a  <u>first</u>  or
              <u>last</u>  of  0  is  equivalent  to  -1  and  -0  is equivalent to the current command (usually the <b>fc</b>
              command); otherwise 0 is equivalent to -1 and -0 is invalid.  If <u>last</u> is not specified, it is  set
              to  the  current  command  for  listing (so that ``fc -l -10'' prints the last 10 commands) and to
              <u>first</u> otherwise.  If <u>first</u> is not specified, it is set to the previous command for editing and -16
              for listing.

              The <b>-n</b> option suppresses the command numbers when listing.  The <b>-r</b> option reverses  the  order  of
              the  commands.  If the <b>-l</b> option is given, the commands are listed on standard output.  Otherwise,
              the editor given by <u>ename</u> is invoked on a file containing those commands.  If <u>ename</u> is not  given,
              the  value  of  the  <b>FCEDIT</b>  variable  is  used, and the value of <b>EDITOR</b> if <b>FCEDIT</b> is not set.  If
              neither variable is set, <u>vi</u> is used.  When editing is complete, the edited commands are echoed and
              executed.

              In the second form, <u>command</u> is re-executed after each instance of <u>pat</u> is replaced by <u>rep</u>.  <u>Command</u>
              is interpreted the same as <u>first</u> above.  A useful alias to use with this is ``r="fc -s"'', so that
              typing ``r cc'' runs the last command beginning with ``cc'' and typing ``r'' re-executes the  last
              command.

              If  the first form is used, the return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered or <u>first</u>
              or <u>last</u> specify history lines out of range.  If the <b>-e</b> option is supplied, the return value is the
              value of the last command executed or failure if an  error  occurs  with  the  temporary  file  of
              commands.   If  the  second  form  is  used, the return status is that of the command re-executed,
              unless <u>cmd</u> does not specify a valid history line, in which case <b>fc</b> returns failure.

       <b>fg</b> [<u>jobspec</u>]
              Resume <u>jobspec</u> in the foreground, and make it the current job.  If <u>jobspec</u>  is  not  present,  the
              shell's  notion  of  the <u>current</u> <u>job</u> is used.  The return value is that of the command placed into
              the foreground, or failure if run when job control is disabled  or,  when  run  with  job  control
              enabled,  if  <u>jobspec</u>  does  not  specify  a valid job or <u>jobspec</u> specifies a job that was started
              without job control.

       <b>getopts</b> <u>optstring</u> <u>name</u> [<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>]
              <b>getopts</b> is used by shell procedures to parse positional parameters.  <u>optstring</u> contains the option
              characters to be recognized; if a character is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have
              an argument, which should be separated from it by  white  space.   The  colon  and  question  mark
              characters may not be used as option characters.  Each time it is invoked, <b>getopts</b> places the next
              option  in  the  shell variable <u>name</u>, initializing <u>name</u> if it does not exist, and the index of the
              next argument to be processed into the variable <b>OPTIND</b>.  <b>OPTIND</b> is initialized to 1 each time  the
              shell  or  a  shell  script  is invoked.  When an option requires an argument, <b>getopts</b> places that
              argument into the variable <b>OPTARG</b>.  The shell does not reset  <b>OPTIND</b>  automatically;  it  must  be
              manually  reset between multiple calls to <b>getopts</b> within the same shell invocation if a new set of
              parameters is to be used.

              When the end of options is encountered, <b>getopts</b> exits with  a  return  value  greater  than  zero.
              <b>OPTIND</b> is set to the index of the first non-option argument, and <u>name</u> is set to ?.

              <b>getopts</b>  normally  parses  the  positional  parameters,  but if more arguments are supplied as <u>arg</u>
              values, <b>getopts</b> parses those instead.

              <b>getopts</b> can report errors in two ways.  If the first character of <u>optstring</u>  is  a  colon,  <u>silent</u>
              error  reporting  is  used.   In  normal  operation,  diagnostic messages are printed when invalid
              options or missing option arguments are encountered.  If the variable <b>OPTERR</b> is set to 0, no error
              messages will be displayed, even if the first character of <u>optstring</u> is not a colon.

              If an invalid option is seen, <b>getopts</b> places ? into <u>name</u> and,  if  not  silent,  prints  an  error
              message  and  unsets <b>OPTARG</b>.  If <b>getopts</b> is silent, the option character found is placed in <b>OPTARG</b>
              and no diagnostic message is printed.

              If a required argument is not found, and <b>getopts</b> is not silent, a question mark (<b>?</b>) is  placed  in
              <u>name</u>,  <b>OPTARG</b>  is  unset, and a diagnostic message is printed.  If <b>getopts</b> is silent, then a colon
              (<b>:</b>) is placed in <u>name</u> and <b>OPTARG</b> is set to the option character found.

              <b>getopts</b> returns true if an option, specified or unspecified, is found.  It returns  false  if  the
              end of options is encountered or an error occurs.

       <b>hash</b> [<b>-lr</b>] [<b>-p</b> <u>filename</u>] [<b>-dt</b>] [<u>name</u>]
              Each  time  <b>hash</b>  is invoked, the full pathname of the command <u>name</u> is determined by searching the
              directories in <b>$PATH</b> and remembered.  Any previously-remembered pathname is discarded.  If the  <b>-p</b>
              option  is supplied, no path search is performed, and <u>filename</u> is used as the full filename of the
              command.  The <b>-r</b> option causes the shell to forget all remembered locations.  The <b>-d</b> option causes
              the shell to forget the remembered location of each <u>name</u>.  If the <b>-t</b> option is supplied, the  full
              pathname  to which each <u>name</u> corresponds is printed.  If multiple <u>name</u> arguments are supplied with
              <b>-t</b>, the <u>name</u> is printed before the hashed full pathname.   The  <b>-l</b>  option  causes  output  to  be
              displayed  in  a  format that may be reused as input.  If no arguments are given, or if only <b>-l</b> is
              supplied, information about remembered commands is printed.  The return status is  true  unless  a
              <u>name</u> is not found or an invalid option is supplied.

       <b>help</b> [<b>-dms</b>] [<u>pattern</u>]
              Display  helpful information about builtin commands.  If <u>pattern</u> is specified, <b>help</b> gives detailed
              help on all commands matching <u>pattern</u>; otherwise help for  all  the  builtins  and  shell  control
              structures is printed.
              <b>-d</b>     Display a short description of each <u>pattern</u>
              <b>-m</b>     Display the description of each <u>pattern</u> in a manpage-like format
              <b>-s</b>     Display only a short usage synopsis for each <u>pattern</u>

              The return status is 0 unless no command matches <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>history</b> <b>[</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>
       <b>history</b> <b>-c</b>
       <b>history</b> <b>-d</b> <u>offset</u>
       <b>history</b> <b>-d</b> <u>start</u>-<u>end</u>
       <b>history</b> <b>-anrw</b> [<u>filename</u>]
       <b>history</b> <b>-p</b> <u>arg</u> [<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>]
       <b>history</b> <b>-s</b> <u>arg</u> [<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>]
              With  no  options, display the command history list with line numbers.  Lines listed with a <b>*</b> have
              been modified.   An  argument  of  <u>n</u>  lists  only  the  last  <u>n</u>  lines.   If  the  shell  variable
              <b>HISTTIMEFORMAT</b>  is  set and not null, it is used as a format string for <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></u>(3) to display the
              time stamp associated with each displayed history entry.  No intervening blank is printed  between
              the formatted time stamp and the history line.  If <u>filename</u> is supplied, it is used as the name of
              the history file; if not, the value of <b>HISTFILE</b> is used.  Options, if supplied, have the following
              meanings:
              <b>-c</b>     Clear the history list by deleting all the entries.
              <b>-d</b> <u>offset</u>
                     Delete  the  history entry at position <u>offset</u>.  If <u>offset</u> is negative, it is interpreted as
                     relative to one greater than the last history position, so negative indices count back from
                     the end of the history, and an index of -1 refers to the current <b>history</b> <b>-d</b> command.
              <b>-d</b> <u>start</u>-<u>end</u>
                     Delete the range of history entries between positions <u>start</u> and <u>end</u>,  inclusive.   Positive
                     and negative values for <u>start</u> and <u>end</u> are interpreted as described above.
              <b>-a</b>     Append  the  ``new''  history  lines  to the history file.  These are history lines entered
                     since the beginning of the current <b>bash</b> session, but not already appended  to  the  history
                     file.
              <b>-n</b>     Read  the  history  lines  not  already read from the history file into the current history
                     list.  These are lines appended to the history file since the beginning of the current <b>bash</b>
                     session.
              <b>-r</b>     Read the contents of the history file and append them to the current history list.
              <b>-w</b>     Write the current history  list  to  the  history  file,  overwriting  the  history  file's
                     contents.
              <b>-p</b>     Perform  history  substitution on the following <u>args</u> and display the result on the standard
                     output.  Does not store the results in the history  list.   Each  <u>arg</u>  must  be  quoted  to
                     disable normal history expansion.
              <b>-s</b>     Store the <u>args</u> in the history list as a single entry.  The last command in the history list
                     is removed before the <u>args</u> are added.

              If  the  <b>HISTTIMEFORMAT</b>  variable  is set, the time stamp information associated with each history
              entry is written to the history file, marked with the history comment character.  When the history
              file is read, lines beginning with the history comment character followed immediately by  a  digit
              are  interpreted  as  timestamps for the following history entry.  The return value is 0 unless an
              invalid option is encountered, an error occurs while reading  or  writing  the  history  file,  an
              invalid  <u>offset</u> or range is supplied as an argument to <b>-d</b>, or the history expansion supplied as an
              argument to <b>-p</b> fails.

       <b>jobs</b> [<b>-lnprs</b>] [ <u>jobspec</u> ... ]
       <b>jobs</b> <b>-x</b> <u>command</u> [ <u>args</u> ... ]
              The first form lists the active jobs.  The options have the following meanings:
              <b>-l</b>     List process IDs in addition to the normal information.
              <b>-n</b>     Display information only about jobs that have  changed  status  since  the  user  was  last
                     notified of their status.
              <b>-p</b>     List only the process ID of the job's process group leader.
              <b>-r</b>     Display only running jobs.
              <b>-s</b>     Display only stopped jobs.

              If  <u>jobspec</u>  is given, output is restricted to information about that job.  The return status is 0
              unless an invalid option is encountered or an invalid <u>jobspec</u> is supplied.

              If the <b>-x</b> option is supplied, <b>jobs</b> replaces  any  <u>jobspec</u>  found  in  <u>command</u>  or  <u>args</u>  with  the
              corresponding process group ID, and executes <u>command</u> passing it <u>args</u>, returning its exit status.

       <b>kill</b> [<b>-s</b> <u>sigspec</u> | <b>-n</b> <u>signum</u> | <b>-</b><u>sigspec</u>] [<u>pid</u> | <u>jobspec</u>] ...
       <b>kill</b> <b>-l</b>|<b>-L</b> [<u>sigspec</u> | <u>exit_status</u>]
              Send  the  signal named by <u>sigspec</u> or <u>signum</u> to the processes named by <u>pid</u> or <u>jobspec</u>.  <u>sigspec</u> is
              either a case-insensitive signal name such as <b>SIGKILL</b> (with or without the <b>SIG</b> prefix) or a signal
              number; <u>signum</u> is a signal number.  If <u>sigspec</u> is  not  present,  then  <b>SIGTERM</b>  is  assumed.   An
              argument  of <b>-l</b> lists the signal names.  If any arguments are supplied when <b>-l</b> is given, the names
              of the signals corresponding to the arguments are  listed,  and  the  return  status  is  0.   The
              <u>exit_status</u>  argument  to <b>-l</b> is a number specifying either a signal number or the exit status of a
              process terminated by a signal.  The <b>-L</b> option is equivalent to <b>-l</b>.  <b>kill</b> returns true if at least
              one signal was successfully sent, or false if an error occurs or an invalid option is encountered.

       <b>let</b> <u>arg</u> [<u>arg</u> ...]
              Each <u>arg</u> is an arithmetic expression to be evaluated (see <b>ARITHMETIC</b> <b>EVALUATION</b> in  <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>).   If
              the last <u>arg</u> evaluates to 0, <b>let</b> returns 1; 0 is returned otherwise.

       <b>local</b> [<u>option</u>] [<u>name</u>[=<u>value</u>] ... | - ]
              For  each argument, a local variable named <u>name</u> is created, and assigned <u>value</u>.  The <u>option</u> can be
              any of the options accepted by <b>declare</b>.  When <b>local</b> is used  within  a  function,  it  causes  the
              variable <u>name</u> to have a visible scope restricted to that function and its children.  If <u>name</u> is -,
              the  set  of  shell options is made local to the function in which <b>local</b> is invoked: shell options
              changed using the <b>set</b> builtin inside the function are restored to their original values  when  the
              function returns.  The restore is effected as if a series of <b>set</b> commands were executed to restore
              the values that were in place before the function.  With no operands, <b>local</b> writes a list of local
              variables  to  the  standard output.  It is an error to use <b>local</b> when not within a function.  The
              return status is 0 unless <b>local</b> is used outside a function, an invalid <u>name</u> is supplied,  or  <u>name</u>
              is a readonly variable.

       <b>logout</b> Exit a login shell.

       <b>mapfile</b> [<b>-d</b> <u>delim</u>] [<b>-n</b> <u>count</u>] [<b>-O</b> <u>origin</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>count</u>] [<b>-t</b>] [<b>-u</b> <u>fd</u>] [<b>-C</b> <u>callback</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>quantum</u>] [<u>array</u>]
       <b>readarray</b> [<b>-d</b> <u>delim</u>] [<b>-n</b> <u>count</u>] [<b>-O</b> <u>origin</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>count</u>] [<b>-t</b>] [<b>-u</b> <u>fd</u>] [<b>-C</b> <u>callback</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>quantum</u>] [<u>array</u>]
              Read  lines from the standard input into the indexed array variable <u>array</u>, or from file descriptor
              <u>fd</u> if the <b>-u</b> option is supplied.   The  variable  <b>MAPFILE</b>  is  the  default  <u>array</u>.   Options,  if
              supplied, have the following meanings:
              <b>-d</b>     The first character of <u>delim</u> is used to terminate each input line, rather than newline.  If
                     <u>delim</u> is the empty string, <b>mapfile</b> will terminate a line when it reads a NUL character.
              <b>-n</b>     Copy at most <u>count</u> lines.  If <u>count</u> is 0, all lines are copied.
              <b>-O</b>     Begin assigning to <u>array</u> at index <u>origin</u>.  The default index is 0.
              <b>-s</b>     Discard the first <u>count</u> lines read.
              <b>-t</b>     Remove a trailing <u>delim</u> (default newline) from each line read.
              <b>-u</b>     Read lines from file descriptor <u>fd</u> instead of the standard input.
              <b>-C</b>     Evaluate <u>callback</u> each time <u>quantum</u> lines are read.  The <b>-c</b> option specifies <u>quantum</u>.
              <b>-c</b>     Specify the number of lines read between each call to <u>callback</u>.

              If  <b>-C</b>  is  specified  without <b>-c</b>, the default quantum is 5000.  When <u>callback</u> is evaluated, it is
              supplied the index of the next array element to be assigned and the line to be  assigned  to  that
              element  as  additional  arguments.   <u>callback</u>  is evaluated after the line is read but before the
              array element is assigned.

              If not supplied with an explicit origin, <b>mapfile</b> will clear <u>array</u> before assigning to it.

              <b>mapfile</b> returns successfully unless an invalid option or option argument  is  supplied,  <u>array</u>  is
              invalid or unassignable, or if <u>array</u> is not an indexed array.

       <b>popd</b> [-<b>n</b>] [+<u>n</u>] [-<u>n</u>]
              Removes  entries from the directory stack.  The elements are numbered from 0 starting at the first
              directory listed by <b>dirs</b>.  With no arguments, <b>popd</b> removes the top directory from the  stack,  and
              changes to the new top directory.  Arguments, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              <b>-n</b>     Suppresses the normal change of directory when removing directories from the stack, so that
                     only the stack is manipulated.
              <b>+</b><u>n</u>     Removes the <u>n</u>th entry counting from the left of the list shown by <b>dirs</b>, starting with zero,
                     from  the  stack.   For  example:  ``popd +0'' removes the first directory, ``popd +1'' the
                     second.
              <b>-</b><u>n</u>     Removes the <u>n</u>th entry counting from the right of the list  shown  by  <b>dirs</b>,  starting  with
                     zero.  For example: ``popd -0'' removes the last directory, ``popd -1'' the next to last.

              If  the  top  element of the directory stack is modified, and the <u>-n</u> option was not supplied, <b>popd</b>
              uses the <b>cd</b> builtin to change to the directory at the top of the stack.  If  the  <b>cd</b>  fails,  <b>popd</b>
              returns a non-zero value.

              Otherwise,  <b>popd</b>  returns false if an invalid option is encountered, the directory stack is empty,
              or a non-existent directory stack entry is specified.

              If the <b>popd</b> command is successful, bash runs <b>dirs</b> to show the  final  contents  of  the  directory
              stack, and the return status is 0.

       <b>printf</b> [<b>-v</b> <u>var</u>] <u>format</u> [<u>arguments</u>]
              Write  the  formatted  <u>arguments</u>  to  the standard output under the control of the <u>format</u>.  The <b>-v</b>
              option causes the output to be assigned to the variable <u>var</u>  rather  than  being  printed  to  the
              standard output.

              The  <u>format</u>  is  a character string which contains three types of objects: plain characters, which
              are simply copied to standard output, character escape sequences, which are converted  and  copied
              to  the  standard  output,  and  format  specifications, each of which causes printing of the next
              successive <u>argument</u>.   In  addition  to  the  standard  <u><a href="../man1/printf.1.html">printf</a></u>(1)  format  specifications,  <b>printf</b>
              interprets the following extensions:
              <b>%b</b>     causes  <b>printf</b>  to  expand  backslash escape sequences in the corresponding <u>argument</u> in the
                     same way as <b>echo</b> <b>-e</b>.
              <b>%q</b>     causes <b>printf</b> to output the corresponding <u>argument</u> in a format that can be reused as  shell
                     input.
              <b>%Q</b>     like <b>%q</b>, but applies any supplied precision to the <u>argument</u> before quoting it.
              <b>%(</b><u>datefmt</u><b>)T</b>
                     causes  <b>printf</b>  to  output  the  date-time  string resulting from using <u>datefmt</u> as a format
                     string for <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></u>(3).  The corresponding <u>argument</u> is an integer representing  the  number
                     of  seconds  since  the  epoch.  Two special argument values may be used: -1 represents the
                     current time, and -2 represents the  time  the  shell  was  invoked.   If  no  argument  is
                     specified,  conversion  behaves as if -1 had been given.  This is an exception to the usual
                     <b>printf</b> behavior.

              The %b, %q, and %T directives all use the field width and  precision  arguments  from  the  format
              specification and write that many bytes from (or use that wide a field for) the expanded argument,
              which usually contains more characters than the original.

              Arguments  to  non-string format specifiers are treated as C constants, except that a leading plus
              or minus sign is allowed, and if the leading character is a single or double quote, the  value  is
              the ASCII value of the following character.

              The  <u>format</u>  is  reused as necessary to consume all of the <u>arguments</u>.  If the <u>format</u> requires more
              <u>arguments</u> than are supplied, the extra format specifications behave as if a  zero  value  or  null
              string,  as  appropriate,  had  been  supplied.   The return value is zero on success, non-zero on
              failure.

       <b>pushd</b> [<b>-n</b>] [+<u>n</u>] [-<u>n</u>]
       <b>pushd</b> [<b>-n</b>] [<u>dir</u>]
              Adds a directory to the top of the directory stack, or rotates the stack, making the  new  top  of
              the  stack the current working directory.  With no arguments, <b>pushd</b> exchanges the top two elements
              of the directory stack.  Arguments, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              <b>-n</b>     Suppresses the normal change of directory when rotating or adding directories to the stack,
                     so that only the stack is manipulated.
              <b>+</b><u>n</u>     Rotates the stack so that the <u>n</u>th directory (counting from the left of the  list  shown  by
                     <b>dirs</b>, starting with zero) is at the top.
              <b>-</b><u>n</u>     Rotates  the  stack so that the <u>n</u>th directory (counting from the right of the list shown by
                     <b>dirs</b>, starting with zero) is at the top.
              <u>dir</u>    Adds <u>dir</u> to the directory stack at the top

              After the stack has been modified, if the <b>-n</b> option was not supplied, <b>pushd</b> uses the <b>cd</b> builtin to
              change to the directory at the top of the stack.  If the <b>cd</b> fails, <b>pushd</b> returns a non-zero value.

              Otherwise, if no arguments are supplied, <b>pushd</b> returns 0 unless  the  directory  stack  is  empty.
              When  rotating  the directory stack, <b>pushd</b> returns 0 unless the directory stack is empty or a non-
              existent directory stack element is specified.

              If the <b>pushd</b> command is successful, bash runs <b>dirs</b> to show the final  contents  of  the  directory
              stack.

       <b>pwd</b> [<b>-LP</b>]
              Print  the  absolute  pathname of the current working directory.  The pathname printed contains no
              symbolic links if the <b>-P</b> option is supplied or the <b>-o</b> <b>physical</b> option to the <b>set</b>  builtin  command
              is  enabled.   If  the  <b>-L</b>  option  is used, the pathname printed may contain symbolic links.  The
              return status is 0 unless an error occurs while reading the name of the current  directory  or  an
              invalid option is supplied.

       <b>read</b> [<b>-ers</b>] [<b>-a</b> <u>aname</u>] [<b>-d</b> <u>delim</u>] [<b>-i</b> <u>text</u>] [<b>-n</b> <u>nchars</u>] [<b>-N</b> <u>nchars</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>prompt</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u>] [<b>-u</b> <u>fd</u>]
       [<u>name</u> ...]
              One  line  is read from the standard input, or from the file descriptor <u>fd</u> supplied as an argument
              to the <b>-u</b> option, split into words as described in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u> under <b>Word</b>  <b>Splitting</b>,  and  the  first
              word  is  assigned to the first <u>name</u>, the second word to the second <u>name</u>, and so on.  If there are
              more words than names, the remaining words and their intervening delimiters are  assigned  to  the
              last  <u>name</u>.   If  there are fewer words read from the input stream than names, the remaining names
              are assigned empty values.  The characters in <b>IFS</b> are used to split the line into words using  the
              same  rules  the  shell  uses  for  expansion  (described  in  <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u> under <b>Word</b> <b>Splitting</b>).  The
              backslash character (<b>\</b>) may be used to remove any special meaning for the next character read  and
              for line continuation.  Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              <b>-a</b> <u>aname</u>
                     The  words  are  assigned to sequential indices of the array variable <u>aname</u>, starting at 0.
                     <u>aname</u> is unset before any new values are assigned.  Other <u>name</u> arguments are ignored.
              <b>-d</b> <u>delim</u>
                     The first character of <u>delim</u> is used to terminate the input line, rather than newline.   If
                     <u>delim</u> is the empty string, <b>read</b> will terminate a line when it reads a NUL character.
              <b>-e</b>     If the standard input is coming from a terminal, <b>readline</b> (see <b>READLINE</b> in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>) is used
                     to  obtain  the  line.   Readline  uses  the  current  (or default, if line editing was not
                     previously active) editing settings, but uses readline's default filename completion.
              <b>-i</b> <u>text</u>
                     If <b>readline</b> is being used to read the line, <u>text</u> is placed into the editing  buffer  before
                     editing begins.
              <b>-n</b> <u>nchars</u>
                     <b>read</b>  returns  after  reading  <u>nchars</u> characters rather than waiting for a complete line of
                     input, but honors a  delimiter  if  fewer  than  <u>nchars</u>  characters  are  read  before  the
                     delimiter.
              <b>-N</b> <u>nchars</u>
                     <b>read</b>  returns  after  reading  exactly <u>nchars</u> characters rather than waiting for a complete
                     line of input,  unless  EOF  is  encountered  or  <b>read</b>  times  out.   Delimiter  characters
                     encountered  in  the  input are not treated specially and do not cause <b>read</b> to return until
                     <u>nchars</u> characters are read.  The result is not split on the characters in <b>IFS</b>;  the  intent
                     is  that  the  variable  is  assigned  exactly  the  characters read (with the exception of
                     backslash; see the <b>-r</b> option below).
              <b>-p</b> <u>prompt</u>
                     Display <u>prompt</u> on standard error, without a trailing newline, before attempting to read any
                     input.  The prompt is displayed only if input is coming from a terminal.
              <b>-r</b>     Backslash does not act as an escape character.  The backslash is considered to be  part  of
                     the  line.   In  particular,  a  backslash-newline  pair  may  not  then  be used as a line
                     continuation.
              <b>-s</b>     Silent mode.  If input is coming from a terminal, characters are not echoed.
              <b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u>
                     Cause <b>read</b> to time out and return failure if a complete  line  of  input  (or  a  specified
                     number  of characters) is not read within <u>timeout</u> seconds.  <u>timeout</u> may be a decimal number
                     with a fractional portion following the decimal point.  This option is  only  effective  if
                     <b>read</b>  is  reading input from a terminal, pipe, or other special file; it has no effect when
                     reading from regular files.  If <b>read</b> times out, <b>read</b> saves any partial input read into  the
                     specified variable <u>name</u>.  If <u>timeout</u> is 0, <b>read</b> returns immediately, without trying to read
                     any  data.  The exit status is 0 if input is available on the specified file descriptor, or
                     the read will return EOF, non-zero otherwise.  The exit status is greater than 128  if  the
                     timeout is exceeded.
              <b>-u</b> <u>fd</u>  Read input from file descriptor <u>fd</u>.

              If no <u>names</u> are supplied, the line read, without the ending delimiter but otherwise unmodified, is
              assigned  to the variable <b>REPLY</b>.  The exit status is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered, <b>read</b>
              times out (in which case the status is greater than 128), a variable  assignment  error  (such  as
              assigning  to  a  readonly  variable)  occurs,  or  an  invalid file descriptor is supplied as the
              argument to <b>-u</b>.

       <b>readonly</b> [<b>-aAf</b>] [<b>-p</b>] [<u>name</u>[=<u>word</u>] ...]
              The given <u>names</u> are marked readonly; the values of these <u>names</u> may not be  changed  by  subsequent
              assignment.  If the <b>-f</b> option is supplied, the functions corresponding to the <u>names</u> are so marked.
              The  <b>-a</b> option restricts the variables to indexed arrays; the <b>-A</b> option restricts the variables to
              associative arrays.  If both options are supplied, <b>-A</b> takes precedence.  If no <u>name</u> arguments  are
              given,  or  if  the  <b>-p</b>  option  is  supplied, a list of all readonly names is printed.  The other
              options may be used to restrict the output to a subset of the  set  of  readonly  names.   The  <b>-p</b>
              option  causes output to be displayed in a format that may be reused as input.  If a variable name
              is followed by =<u>word</u>, the value of the variable is set to <u>word</u>.  The return status is 0 unless  an
              invalid  option  is  encountered,  one  of  the <u>names</u> is not a valid shell variable name, or <b>-f</b> is
              supplied with a <u>name</u> that is not a function.

       <b>return</b> [<u>n</u>]
              Causes a function to stop executing and return the value specified by <u>n</u> to its caller.   If  <u>n</u>  is
              omitted,  the  return status is that of the last command executed in the function body.  If <b>return</b>
              is executed by a trap handler, the last command used to determine the status is the  last  command
              executed  before  the  trap  handler.  If <b>return</b> is executed during a <b>DEBUG</b> trap, the last command
              used to determine the status is the last command executed by the trap handler  before  <b>return</b>  was
              invoked.   If  <b>return</b>  is  used  outside  a  function,  but  during execution of a script by the <b>.</b>
              (<b>source</b>) command, it causes the shell to stop executing that script and return  either  <u>n</u>  or  the
              exit status of the last command executed within the script as the exit status of the script.  If <u>n</u>
              is  supplied,  the return value is its least significant 8 bits.  The return status is non-zero if
              <b>return</b> is supplied a non-numeric argument, or is used outside a function and not during  execution
              of  a  script  by  <b>.</b>  or  <b>source</b>.   Any command associated with the <b>RETURN</b> trap is executed before
              execution resumes after the function or script.

       <b>set</b> [<b>-abefhkmnptuvxBCEHPT</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>option-name</u>] [<b>--</b>] [<b>-</b>] [<u>arg</u> ...]
       <b>set</b> [<b>+abefhkmnptuvxBCEHPT</b>] [<b>+o</b> <u>option-name</u>] [<b>--</b>] [<b>-</b>] [<u>arg</u> ...]
              Without options, display the name and value of each shell variable in a format that can be  reused
              as  input  for  setting  or  resetting the currently-set variables.  Read-only variables cannot be
              reset.  In <u>posix</u> <u>mode</u>, only shell variables are listed.  The output is  sorted  according  to  the
              current  locale.   When  options are specified, they set or unset shell attributes.  Any arguments
              remaining after option processing are treated as values for  the  positional  parameters  and  are
              assigned, in order, to <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b>, <b>...</b>  <b>$</b><u>n</u>.  Options, if specified, have the following meanings:
              <b>-a</b>      Each  variable  or  function that is created or modified is given the export attribute and
                      marked for export to the environment of subsequent commands.
              <b>-b</b>      Report the status of terminated background jobs immediately, rather than before  the  next
                      primary prompt.  This is effective only when job control is enabled.
              <b>-e</b>      Exit  immediately if a <u>pipeline</u> (which may consist of a single <u>simple</u> <u>command</u>), a <u>list</u>, or
                      a <u>compound</u> <u>command</u> (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>GRAMMAR</b> in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>), exits  with  a  non-zero  status.   The
                      shell  does  not  exit  if  the command that fails is part of the command list immediately
                      following a <b>while</b> or <b>until</b> keyword, part of the test following the  <b>if</b>  or  <b>elif</b>  reserved
                      words,  part  of  any command executed in a <b>&amp;&amp;</b> or <b>||</b> list except the command following the
                      final <b>&amp;&amp;</b> or <b>||</b>, any command in a pipeline but the last, or if the command's  return  value
                      is  being inverted with <b>!</b>.  If a compound command other than a subshell returns a non-zero
                      status because a command failed while <b>-e</b> was being ignored, the shell does  not  exit.   A
                      trap on <b>ERR</b>, if set, is executed before the shell exits.  This option applies to the shell
                      environment and each subshell environment separately (see <b>COMMAND</b> <b>EXECUTION</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> in
                      <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>),  and  may  cause  subshells  to  exit  before  executing all the commands in the
                      subshell.

                      If a compound command or shell function executes in a context where <b>-e</b> is  being  ignored,
                      none  of  the  commands  executed  within  the  compound  command or function body will be
                      affected by the <b>-e</b> setting, even if <b>-e</b> is set and a command returns a failure status.   If
                      a  compound  command  or  shell  function sets <b>-e</b> while executing in a context where <b>-e</b> is
                      ignored, that setting will not have any effect until the compound command or  the  command
                      containing the function call completes.
              <b>-f</b>      Disable pathname expansion.
              <b>-h</b>      Remember the location of commands as they are looked up for execution.  This is enabled by
                      default.
              <b>-k</b>      All  arguments  in  the  form of assignment statements are placed in the environment for a
                      command, not just those that precede the command name.
              <b>-m</b>      Monitor mode.  Job control is enabled.  This option  is  on  by  default  for  interactive
                      shells  on  systems  that support it (see <b>JOB</b> <b>CONTROL</b> in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>).  All processes run in a
                      separate process group.  When  a  background  job  completes,  the  shell  prints  a  line
                      containing its exit status.
              <b>-n</b>      Read  commands  but  do  not  execute  them.  This may be used to check a shell script for
                      syntax errors.  This is ignored by interactive shells.
              <b>-o</b> <u>option-name</u>
                      The <u>option-name</u> can be one of the following:
                      <b>allexport</b>
                              Same as <b>-a</b>.
                      <b>braceexpand</b>
                              Same as <b>-B</b>.
                      <b>emacs</b>   Use an emacs-style command line editing interface.  This  is  enabled  by  default
                              when  the  shell  is interactive, unless the shell is started with the <b>--noediting</b>
                              option.  This also affects the editing interface used for <b>read</b> <b>-e</b>.
                      <b>errexit</b> Same as <b>-e</b>.
                      <b>errtrace</b>
                              Same as <b>-E</b>.
                      <b>functrace</b>
                              Same as <b>-T</b>.
                      <b>hashall</b> Same as <b>-h</b>.
                      <b>histexpand</b>
                              Same as <b>-H</b>.
                      <b>history</b> Enable command history, as described in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u> under <b>HISTORY</b>.  This option is  on
                              by default in interactive shells.

                      <b>+o</b> is supplied with no <u>option-name</u>, a series of  <b>set</b>  commands  to  recreate  the  current
                      option settings is displayed on the standard output.
              <b>-p</b>      Turn  on  <u>privileged</u>  mode.  In this mode, the <b>$ENV</b> and <b>$BASH_ENV</b> files are not processed,
                      shell functions are not inherited from  the  environment,  and  the  <b>SHELLOPTS</b>,  <b>BASHOPTS</b>,
                      <b>CDPATH</b>,  and <b>GLOBIGNORE</b> variables, if they appear in the environment, are ignored.  If the
                      shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the real user (group) id,
                      and the <b>-p</b> option is not supplied, these actions are taken and the effective  user  id  is
                      set  to  the real user id.  If the <b>-p</b> option is supplied at startup, the effective user id
                      is not reset.  Turning this option off causes the effective user and group ids to  be  set
                      to the real user and group ids.
              <b>-r</b>      Enable restricted shell mode.  This option cannot be unset once it has been set.
              <b>-t</b>      Exit after reading and executing one command.
              <b>-u</b>      Treat  unset  variables  and  parameters other than the special parameters "@" and "*", or
                      array variables subscripted with "@"  or  "*",  as  an  error  when  performing  parameter
                      expansion.   If expansion is attempted on an unset variable or parameter, the shell prints
                      an error message, and, if not interactive, exits with a non-zero status.
              <b>-v</b>      Print shell input lines as they are read.
              <b>-x</b>      After expanding each <u>simple</u>  <u>command</u>,  <b>for</b>  command,  <b>case</b>  command,  <b>select</b>  command,  or
                      arithmetic <b>for</b> command, display the expanded value of <b>PS4</b>, followed by the command and its
                      expanded arguments or associated word list.
              <b>-B</b>      The  shell  performs  brace  expansion  (see  <b>Brace</b>  <b>Expansion</b> in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>).  This is on by
                      default.
              <b>-C</b>      If set, <b>bash</b> does not overwrite an existing file  with  the  <b>&gt;</b>,  <b>&gt;&amp;</b>,  and  <b>&lt;&gt;</b>  redirection
                      operators.   This  may  be  overridden when creating output files by using the redirection
                      operator <b>&gt;|</b> instead of <b>&gt;</b>.
              <b>-E</b>      If set, any trap on <b>ERR</b> is  inherited  by  shell  functions,  command  substitutions,  and
                      commands  executed  in  a subshell environment.  The <b>ERR</b> trap is normally not inherited in
                      such cases.
              <b>-H</b>      Enable <b>!</b>  style history substitution.  This option is on by  default  when  the  shell  is
                      interactive.
              <b>-P</b>      If  set, the shell does not resolve symbolic links when executing commands such as <b>cd</b> that
                      change the current working directory.  It uses the physical directory  structure  instead.
                      By  default,  <b>bash</b> follows the logical chain of directories when performing commands which
                      change the current directory.
              <b>-T</b>      If set, any  traps  on  <b>DEBUG</b>  and  <b>RETURN</b>  are  inherited  by  shell  functions,  command
                      substitutions,  and  commands  executed  in  a subshell environment.  The <b>DEBUG</b> and <b>RETURN</b>
                      traps are normally not inherited in such cases.
              <b>--</b>      If no arguments follow this option, then the positional parameters are unset.   Otherwise,
                      the positional parameters are set to the <u>arg</u>s, even if some of them begin with a <b>-</b>.
              <b>-</b>       Signal  the  end  of  options,  cause  all remaining <u>arg</u>s to be assigned to the positional
                      parameters.  The <b>-x</b> and <b>-v</b> options are turned off.  If there are no <u>arg</u>s,  the  positional
                      parameters remain unchanged.

              The options are off by default unless otherwise noted.  Using + rather than - causes these options
              to  be  turned off.  The options can also be specified as arguments to an invocation of the shell.
              The current set of options may be found in <b>$-</b>.  The return status is always true unless an invalid
              option is encountered.

       <b>shift</b> [<u>n</u>]
              The positional parameters from <u>n</u>+1 ... are renamed to  <b>$1</b>  <b>....</b>   Parameters  represented  by  the
              numbers  <b>$#</b>  down  to <b>$#</b>-<u>n</u>+1 are unset.  <u>n</u> must be a non-negative number less than or equal to <b>$#</b>.
              If <u>n</u> is 0, no parameters are changed.  If <u>n</u> is not given, it is assumed to be 1.  If <u>n</u> is  greater
              than  <b>$#</b>,  the positional parameters are not changed.  The return status is greater than zero if <u>n</u>
              is greater than <b>$#</b> or less than zero; otherwise 0.

       <b>shopt</b> [<b>-pqsu</b>] [<b>-o</b>] [<u>optname</u> ...]
              Toggle the values of settings controlling optional shell behavior.  The  settings  can  be  either
              those  listed  below,  or, if the <b>-o</b> option is used, those available with the <b>-o</b> option to the <b>set</b>
              builtin command.  With no options, or with the <b>-p</b> option,  a  list  of  all  settable  options  is
              displayed,  with an indication of whether or not each is set; if <u>optnames</u> are supplied, the output
              is restricted to those options.  The <b>-p</b> option causes output to be displayed in a form that may be
              reused as input.  Other options have the following meanings:
              <b>-s</b>     Enable (set) each <u>optname</u>.
              <b>-u</b>     Disable (unset) each <u>optname</u>.
              <b>-q</b>     Suppresses normal output (quiet mode); the return status indicates whether the  <u>optname</u>  is
                     set  or  unset.  If multiple <u>optname</u> arguments are given with <b>-q</b>, the return status is zero
                     if all <u>optnames</u> are enabled; non-zero otherwise.
              <b>-o</b>     Restricts the values of <u>optname</u> to be those defined for the <b>-o</b> option to the <b>set</b> builtin.

              If either <b>-s</b> or <b>-u</b> is used with no <u>optname</u> arguments, <b>shopt</b> shows only those options which are set
              or unset, respectively.  Unless otherwise  noted,  the  <b>shopt</b>  options  are  disabled  (unset)  by
              default.

              The  return  status  when listing options is zero if all <u>optnames</u> are enabled, non-zero otherwise.
              When setting or unsetting options, the return status is zero unless an  <u>optname</u>  is  not  a  valid
              shell option.

              The list of <b>shopt</b> options is:

              <b>assoc_expand_once</b>
                      If  set,  the  shell suppresses multiple evaluation of associative array subscripts during
                      arithmetic expression evaluation, while  executing  builtins  that  can  perform  variable
                      assignments, and while executing builtins that perform array dereferencing.
              <b>autocd</b>  If  set,  a  command  name  that  is the name of a directory is executed as if it were the
                      argument to the <b>cd</b> command.  This option is only used by interactive shells.
              <b>cdable_vars</b>
                      If set, an argument to the <b>cd</b> builtin command that is not a directory is assumed to be the
                      name of a variable whose value is the directory to change to.
              <b>cdspell</b> If set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory component in  a  <b>cd</b>  command  will  be
                      corrected.  The errors checked for are transposed characters, a missing character, and one
                      character  too many.  If a correction is found, the corrected filename is printed, and the
                      command proceeds.  This option is only used by interactive shells.
              <b>checkhash</b>
                      If set, <b>bash</b> checks that a command found in the hash table exists before trying to execute
                      it.  If a hashed command no longer exists, a normal path search is performed.
              <b>checkjobs</b>
                      If set, <b>bash</b> lists  the  status  of  any  stopped  and  running  jobs  before  exiting  an
                      interactive  shell.   If any jobs are running, this causes the exit to be deferred until a
                      second exit is attempted without an intervening command (see <b>JOB</b> <b>CONTROL</b> in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>).  The
                      shell always postpones exiting if any jobs are stopped.
              <b>checkwinsize</b>
                      If set, <b>bash</b> checks the window size after each  external  (non-builtin)  command  and,  if
                      necessary, updates the values of <b>LINES</b> and <b>COLUMNS</b>.  This option is enabled by default.
              <b>cmdhist</b> If  set,  <b>bash</b>  attempts  to save all lines of a multiple-line command in the same history
                      entry.  This allows easy re-editing of multi-line commands.  This  option  is  enabled  by
                      default,  but  only  has  an effect if command history is enabled, as described in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>
                      under <b>HISTORY</b>.
              <b>compat31</b>

              <b>compat43</b>
              <b>compat44</b>
              <b>compat50</b>
                      These control aspects of the shell's compatibility mode (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b>  <b>MODE</b>  in
                      <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>).

              <b>complete_fullquote</b>
                      If  set,  <b>bash</b>  quotes  all  shell  metacharacters  in  filenames and directory names when
                      performing completion.  If not set, <b>bash</b> removes metacharacters such as  the  dollar  sign
                      from  the  set  of  characters  that  will  be  quoted  in  completed filenames when these
                      metacharacters appear in shell variable references in words to be completed.   This  means
                      that  dollar  signs  in  variable  names  that  expand  to directories will not be quoted;
                      however, any dollar signs appearing in filenames will not  be  quoted,  either.   This  is
                      active only when bash is using backslashes to quote completed filenames.  This variable is
                      set by default, which is the default bash behavior in versions through 4.2.

              <b>direxpand</b>
                      If  set,  <b>bash</b> replaces directory names with the results of word expansion when performing
                      filename completion.  This changes the contents of the readline editing  buffer.   If  not
                      set, <b>bash</b> attempts to preserve what the user typed.

              <b>dirspell</b>
                      If set, <b>bash</b> attempts spelling correction on directory names during word completion if the
                      directory name initially supplied does not exist.

              <b>dotglob</b> If set, <b>bash</b> includes filenames beginning with a `.' in the results of pathname expansion.
                      The  filenames  <b>``.''</b>   and  <b>``..''</b>  must always be matched explicitly, even if <b>dotglob</b> is
                      set.

              <b>execfail</b>
                      If set, a non-interactive shell will not exit if it cannot execute the file  specified  as
                      an  argument  to  the  <b>exec</b>  builtin  command.  An interactive shell does not exit if <b>exec</b>
                      fails.

              <b>expand_aliases</b>
                      If set, aliases are expanded as described  in  <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>  under  <b>ALIASES</b>.   This  option  is
                      enabled by default for interactive shells.

              <b>extdebug</b>
                      If  set  at  shell invocation, or in a shell startup file, arrange to execute the debugger
                      profile before the shell starts,  identical  to  the  <b>--debugger</b>  option.   If  set  after
                      invocation, behavior intended for use by debuggers is enabled:

                      <b>1.</b>     The  <b>-F</b> option to the <b>declare</b> builtin displays the source file name and line number
                             corresponding to each function name supplied as an argument.

                      <b>2.</b>     If the command run by the <b>DEBUG</b> trap returns a non-zero value, the next command  is
                             skipped and not executed.

                      <b>3.</b>     If  the  command  run  by  the  <b>DEBUG</b>  trap  returns a value of 2, and the shell is
                             executing in a subroutine (a shell function or a shell script executed by the <b>.</b>  or
                             <b>source</b> builtins), the shell simulates a call to <b>return</b>.

                      <b>4.</b>     <b>BASH_ARGC</b> and <b>BASH_ARGV</b> are updated as described in their descriptions in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>).

                      <b>5.</b>     Function  tracing  is enabled: command substitution, shell functions, and subshells
                             invoked with <b>(</b> <u>command</u> <b>)</b> inherit the <b>DEBUG</b> and <b>RETURN</b> traps.

                      <b>6.</b>     Error tracing is enabled: command  substitution,  shell  functions,  and  subshells
                             invoked with <b>(</b> <u>command</u> <b>)</b> inherit the <b>ERR</b> trap.

              <b>extglob</b> If  set,  the  extended  pattern  matching  features  described  in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u> under <b>Pathname</b>
                      <b>Expansion</b> are enabled.

              <b>extquote</b>
                      If set, <b>$</b>'<u>string</u>' and  <b>$</b>"<u>string</u>"  quoting  is  performed  within  <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>}</b>  expansions
                      enclosed in double quotes.  This option is enabled by default.

              <b>failglob</b>
                      If  set,  patterns  which  fail  to match filenames during pathname expansion result in an
                      expansion error.

              <b>force_fignore</b>
                      If set, the suffixes specified by the <b>FIGNORE</b> shell variable cause  words  to  be  ignored
                      when  performing  word  completion  even  if  the  ignored  words  are  the  only possible
                      completions.  See <b>SHELL</b> <b>VARIABLES</b> in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u> for a description of <b>FIGNORE</b>.  This option is
                      enabled by default.

              <b>globasciiranges</b>
                      If set, range expressions used  in  pattern  matching  bracket  expressions  (see  <b>Pattern</b>
                      <b>Matching</b> in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>) behave as if in the traditional C locale when performing comparisons.

                      collate between <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, and upper-case  and  lower-case  ASCII  characters  will  collate
                      together.

              <b>globskipdots</b>
                      If  set,  pathname expansion will never match the filenames <b>``.''</b>  and <b>``..''</b>, even if the
                      pattern begins with a <b>``.''</b>.  This option is enabled by default.

              <b>globstar</b>
                      If set, the pattern <b>**</b> used in a pathname expansion context will match all files and  zero
                      or  more  directories  and  subdirectories.   If  the  pattern  is  followed  by a <b>/</b>, only
                      directories and subdirectories match.

              <b>gnu_errfmt</b>
                      If set, shell error messages are written in the standard GNU error message format.

              <b>histappend</b>
                      If set, the history list is appended to the file  named  by  the  value  of  the  <b>HISTFILE</b>
                      variable when the shell exits, rather than overwriting the file.

              <b>histreedit</b>
                      If  set,  and  <b>readline</b> is being used, a user is given the opportunity to re-edit a failed
                      history substitution.

              <b>histverify</b>
                      If set, and  <b>readline</b>  is  being  used,  the  results  of  history  substitution  are  not
                      immediately  passed  to  the shell parser.  Instead, the resulting line is loaded into the
                      <b>readline</b> editing buffer, allowing further modification.

              <b>hostcomplete</b>
                      If set, and <b>readline</b> is being used, <b>bash</b> will attempt to perform hostname completion  when
                      a word containing a <b>@</b> is being completed (see <b>Completing</b> under <b>READLINE</b> in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>).  This
                      is enabled by default.

              <b>huponexit</b>
                      If set, <b>bash</b> will send <b>SIGHUP</b> to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.

              <b>inherit_errexit</b>
                      If  set,  command  substitution  inherits  the  value  of  the  <b>errexit</b> option, instead of
                      unsetting it in the subshell environment.  This option  is  enabled  when  <u>posix</u>  <u>mode</u>  is
                      enabled.

              <b>interactive_comments</b>
                      If  set,  allow a word beginning with <b>#</b> to cause that word and all remaining characters on
                      that line to be ignored in an interactive shell (see <b>COMMENTS</b> in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>).  This option is
                      enabled by default.

              <b>lastpipe</b>
                      If set, and job control is not active, the shell runs the last command of a  pipeline  not
                      executed in the background in the current shell environment.

              <b>lithist</b> If  set,  and  the <b>cmdhist</b> option is enabled, multi-line commands are saved to the history
                      with embedded newlines rather than using semicolon separators where possible.

              <b>localvar_inherit</b>
                      If set, local variables inherit the value and attributes of a variable of  the  same  name
                      that  exists  at a previous scope before any new value is assigned.  The nameref attribute
                      is not inherited.

              <b>localvar_unset</b>
                      If set, calling <b>unset</b> on local  variables  in  previous  function  scopes  marks  them  so
                      subsequent  lookups  find them unset until that function returns. This is identical to the
                      behavior of unsetting local variables at the current function scope.

              <b>login_shell</b>
                      The shell sets this option if it is started as a login shell (see <b>INVOCATION</b> in  <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>).
                      The value may not be changed.

              <b>mailwarn</b>
                      If set, and a file that <b>bash</b> is checking for mail has been accessed since the last time it
                      was checked, the message ``The mail in <u>mailfile</u> has been read'' is displayed.

              <b>no_empty_cmd_completion</b>
                      If  set, and <b>readline</b> is being used, <b>bash</b> will not attempt to search the <b>PATH</b> for possible
                      completions when completion is attempted on an empty line.

              <b>nocaseglob</b>
                      If set, <b>bash</b> matches filenames in a  case-insensitive  fashion  when  performing  pathname
                      expansion (see <b>Pathname</b> <b>Expansion</b> in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>).

              <b>nocasematch</b>
                      If set, <b>bash</b> matches patterns in a case-insensitive fashion when performing matching while
                      executing  <b>case</b>  or  <b>[[</b>  conditional  commands,  when performing pattern substitution word
                      expansions, or when filtering possible completions as part of programmable completion.

              <b>noexpand_translation</b>
                      If set, <b>bash</b> encloses the translated results of $"..." quoting in single quotes instead of
                      double quotes.  If the string is not translated, this has no effect.

              <b>nullglob</b>
                      If set, <b>bash</b> allows patterns which match no files (see <b>Pathname</b> <b>Expansion</b> in  <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>)  to
                      expand to a null string, rather than themselves.

              <b>patsub_replacement</b>
                      If set, <b>bash</b> expands occurrences of <b>&amp;</b> in the replacement string of pattern substitution to
                      the  text matched by the pattern, as described under <b>Parameter</b> <b>Expansion</b> in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>.  This
                      option is enabled by default.

              <b>progcomp</b>
                      If set, the programmable completion facilities (see <b>Programmable</b>  <b>Completion</b>  in  <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>)
                      are enabled.  This option is enabled by default.

              <b>progcomp_alias</b>
                      If  set,  and  programmable completion is enabled, <b>bash</b> treats a command name that doesn't
                      have any completions as a possible alias and attempts alias expansion. If it has an alias,
                      <b>bash</b> attempts programmable completion using the command word resulting from  the  expanded
                      alias.

              <b>promptvars</b>
                      If  set,  prompt  strings  undergo  parameter  expansion, command substitution, arithmetic
                      expansion, and quote removal after being expanded as described in  <b>PROMPTING</b>  in  <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>.
                      This option is enabled by default.

              <b>restricted_shell</b>
                      The  shell  sets  this option if it is started in restricted mode (see <b>RESTRICTED</b> <b>SHELL</b> in
                      <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>).  The value may not be changed.  This is not reset when  the  startup  files  are
                      executed, allowing the startup files to discover whether or not a shell is restricted.

              <b>shift_verbose</b>
                      If  set, the <b>shift</b> builtin prints an error message when the shift count exceeds the number
                      of positional parameters.

              <b>sourcepath</b>
                      If set, the <b>.</b> (<b>source</b>) builtin uses the value of <b>PATH</b> to find the directory containing the
                      file supplied as an argument.  This option is enabled by default.

              <b>varredir_close</b>
                      If set, the shell automatically closes  file  descriptors  assigned  using  the  <u>{varname}</u>
                      redirection  syntax  (see  <b>REDIRECTION</b>  in  <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>) instead of leaving them open when the
                      command completes.

              <b>xpg_echo</b>
                      If set, the <b>echo</b> builtin expands backslash-escape sequences by default.

       <b>suspend</b> [<b>-f</b>]
              Suspend the execution of this shell until it receives a <b>SIGCONT</b> signal.  A login shell, or a shell
              without job control enabled, cannot be suspended; the <b>-f</b> option can be used to override  this  and
              force  the suspension.  The return status is 0 unless the shell is a login shell or job control is
              not enabled and <b>-f</b> is not supplied.

       <b>test</b> <u>expr</u>
       <b>[</b> <u>expr</u> <b>]</b>
              Return a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on the evaluation of the conditional expression
              <u>expr</u>.  Each operator and operand must be a separate argument.  Expressions  are  composed  of  the
              primaries  described  in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u> under <b>CONDITIONAL</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b>.  <b>test</b> does not accept any options,
              nor does it accept and ignore an argument of <b>--</b> as signifying the end of options.

              Expressions may be  combined  using  the  following  operators,  listed  in  decreasing  order  of
              precedence.  The evaluation depends on the number of arguments; see below.  Operator precedence is
              used when there are five or more arguments.
              <b>!</b> <u>expr</u> True if <u>expr</u> is false.
              <b>(</b> <u>expr</u> <b>)</b>
                     Returns  the  value  of  <u>expr</u>.   This  may  be  used  to  override the normal precedence of
                     operators.
              <u>expr1</u> -<b>a</b> <u>expr2</u>
                     True if both <u>expr1</u> and <u>expr2</u> are true.
              <u>expr1</u> -<b>o</b> <u>expr2</u>
                     True if either <u>expr1</u> or <u>expr2</u> is true.

              <b>test</b> and <b>[</b> evaluate conditional expressions using a set of rules based on the number of arguments.

              0 arguments
                     The expression is false.
              1 argument
                     The expression is true if and only if the argument is not null.
              2 arguments
                     If the first argument is <b>!</b>, the expression is true if and only if the  second  argument  is
                     null.   If  the  first argument is one of the unary conditional operators listed in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>
                     under <b>CONDITIONAL</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b>, the expression is true if the unary test is  true.   If  the
                     first argument is not a valid unary conditional operator, the expression is false.
              3 arguments
                     The following conditions are applied in the order listed.  If the second argument is one of
                     the  binary  conditional  operators  listed  in  <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u> under <b>CONDITIONAL</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b>, the
                     result of the expression is the result of  the  binary  test  using  the  first  and  third
                     arguments  as operands.  The <b>-a</b> and <b>-o</b> operators are considered binary operators when there
                     are three arguments.  If the first argument is <b>!</b>, the value is the  negation  of  the  two-
                     argument test using the second and third arguments.  If the first argument is exactly <b>(</b> and
                     the  third  argument  is  exactly  <b>)</b>,  the  result  is  the one-argument test of the second
                     argument.  Otherwise, the expression is false.
              4 arguments
                     The following conditions are applied in the order listed.  If the first argument is <b>!</b>,  the
                     result  is  the  negation  of  the  three-argument  expression  composed  of  the remaining
                     arguments.  the two-argument test using the second  and  third  arguments.   If  the  first
                     argument  is exactly <b>(</b> and the fourth argument is exactly <b>)</b>, the result is the two-argument
                     test of the second and third arguments.  Otherwise, the expression is parsed and  evaluated
                     according to precedence using the rules listed above.
              5 or more arguments
                     The  expression  is  parsed  and  evaluated  according to precedence using the rules listed
                     above.

              When used with <b>test</b> or <b>[</b>, the <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> operators sort lexicographically using ASCII ordering.

       <b>times</b>  Print the accumulated user and system times for the shell and for processes run  from  the  shell.
              The return status is 0.

       <b>trap</b> [<b>-lp</b>] [[<u>arg</u>] <u>sigspec</u> ...]
              The  command  <u>arg</u> is to be read and executed when the shell receives signal(s) <u>sigspec</u>.  If <u>arg</u> is
              absent (and there is a single <u>sigspec</u>) or <b>-</b>, each  specified  signal  is  reset  to  its  original
              disposition  (the  value it had upon entrance to the shell).  If <u>arg</u> is the null string the signal
              specified by each <u>sigspec</u> is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes.  If <u>arg</u>  is  not
              present  and  <b>-p</b>  has  been  supplied,  then  the  trap  commands associated with each <u>sigspec</u> are
              displayed.  If no arguments are supplied or if only <b>-p</b> is given, <b>trap</b> prints the list of  commands
              associated  with  each signal.  The <b>-l</b> option causes the shell to print a list of signal names and
              their corresponding numbers.  Each <u>sigspec</u> is either a signal name defined  in  &lt;<u>signal.h</u>&gt;,  or  a
              signal number.  Signal names are case insensitive and the <b>SIG</b> prefix is optional.

              If  a  <u>sigspec</u>  is  <b>EXIT</b>  (0) the command <u>arg</u> is executed on exit from the shell.  If a <u>sigspec</u> is
              <b>DEBUG</b>, the command <u>arg</u> is executed before every <u>simple</u> <u>command</u>, <u>for</u> command, <u>case</u> command,  <u>select</u>
              command,  every  arithmetic <u>for</u> command, and before the first command executes in a shell function
              (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>GRAMMAR</b> in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>).  Refer to the description of the  <b>extdebug</b>  option  to  the  <b>shopt</b>
              builtin  for  details of its effect on the <b>DEBUG</b> trap.  If a <u>sigspec</u> is <b>RETURN</b>, the command <u>arg</u> is
              executed each time a shell function or a script executed with the <b>.</b> or  <b>source</b>  builtins  finishes
              executing.

              If  a  <u>sigspec</u>  is  <b>ERR</b>,  the  command <u>arg</u> is executed whenever a pipeline (which may consist of a
              single simple command), a list, or a compound command returns a non-zero exit status,  subject  to
              the  following  conditions.   The  <b>ERR</b>  trap  is not executed if the failed command is part of the
              command list immediately following a <b>while</b> or <b>until</b> keyword, part of the test in an <u>if</u>  statement,
              part of a command executed in a <b>&amp;&amp;</b> or <b>||</b> list except the command following the final <b>&amp;&amp;</b> or <b>||</b>, any
              command  in  a  pipeline but the last, or if the command's return value is being inverted using <b>!</b>.
              These are the same conditions obeyed by the <b>errexit</b> (<b>-e</b>) option.

              Signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped or reset.  Trapped signals that are  not
              being ignored are reset to their original values in a subshell or subshell environment when one is
              created.  The return status is false if any <u>sigspec</u> is invalid; otherwise <b>trap</b> returns true.

       <b>type</b> [<b>-aftpP</b>] <u>name</u> [<u>name</u> ...]
              With no options, indicate how each <u>name</u> would be interpreted if used as a command name.  If the <b>-t</b>
              option is used, <b>type</b> prints a string which is one of <u>alias</u>, <u>keyword</u>, <u>function</u>, <u>builtin</u>, or <u>file</u> if
              <u>name</u> is an alias, shell reserved word, function, builtin, or disk file, respectively.  If the <u>name</u>
              is  not found, then nothing is printed, and an exit status of false is returned.  If the <b>-p</b> option
              is used, <b>type</b> either returns the name of the disk  file  that  would  be  executed  if  <u>name</u>  were
              specified  as a command name, or nothing if ``type -t name'' would not return <u>file</u>.  The <b>-P</b> option
              forces a <b>PATH</b> search for each <u>name</u>, even if ``type -t name'' would not return <u>file</u>.  If a  command
              is  hashed, <b>-p</b> and <b>-P</b> print the hashed value, which is not necessarily the file that appears first
              in <b>PATH</b>.  If the <b>-a</b> option is used, <b>type</b> prints all of the places that contain an executable named
              <u>name</u>.  This includes aliases and functions, if and only if the <b>-p</b> option is not  also  used.   The
              table  of hashed commands is not consulted when using <b>-a</b>.  The <b>-f</b> option suppresses shell function
              lookup, as with the <b>command</b> builtin.  <b>type</b> returns true if all of the arguments are  found,  false
              if any are not found.

       <b>ulimit</b> [<b>-HS</b>] <b>-a</b>
       <b>ulimit</b> [<b>-HS</b>] [<b>-bcdefiklmnpqrstuvxPRT</b> [<u>limit</u>]]
              Provides  control  over  the  resources  available to the shell and to processes started by it, on
              systems that allow such control.  The <b>-H</b> and <b>-S</b> options specify that the hard or soft limit is set
              for the given resource.  A hard limit cannot be increased by a non-root user once  it  is  set;  a
              soft limit may be increased up to the value of the hard limit.  If neither <b>-H</b> nor <b>-S</b> is specified,
              both  the  soft and hard limits are set.  The value of <u>limit</u> can be a number in the unit specified
              for the resource or one of the special values <b>hard</b>,  <b>soft</b>,  or  <b>unlimited</b>,  which  stand  for  the
              current  hard limit, the current soft limit, and no limit, respectively.  If <u>limit</u> is omitted, the
              current value of the soft limit of the resource is printed, unless the <b>-H</b> option is  given.   When
              more  than  one resource is specified, the limit name and unit, if appropriate, are printed before
              the value.  Other options are interpreted as follows:
              <b>-a</b>     All current limits are reported; no limits are set
              <b>-b</b>     The maximum socket buffer size
              <b>-c</b>     The maximum size of core files created
              <b>-d</b>     The maximum size of a process's data segment
              <b>-e</b>     The maximum scheduling priority ("nice")
              <b>-f</b>     The maximum size of files written by the shell and its children
              <b>-i</b>     The maximum number of pending signals
              <b>-k</b>     The maximum number of kqueues that may be allocated
              <b>-l</b>     The maximum size that may be locked into memory
              <b>-m</b>     The maximum resident set size (many systems do not honor this limit)
              <b>-n</b>     The maximum number of open file descriptors (most systems do not allow  this  value  to  be
                     set)
              <b>-p</b>     The pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be set)
              <b>-q</b>     The maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues
              <b>-r</b>     The maximum real-time scheduling priority
              <b>-s</b>     The maximum stack size
              <b>-t</b>     The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
              <b>-u</b>     The maximum number of processes available to a single user
              <b>-v</b>     The  maximum  amount  of virtual memory available to the shell and, on some systems, to its
                     children
              <b>-x</b>     The maximum number of file locks
              <b>-P</b>     The maximum number of pseudoterminals
              <b>-R</b>     The maximum time a real-time process can run before blocking, in microseconds
              <b>-T</b>     The maximum number of threads

              If <u>limit</u> is given, and the <b>-a</b> option is not  used,  <u>limit</u>  is  the  new  value  of  the  specified
              resource.   If no option is given, then <b>-f</b> is assumed.  Values are in 1024-byte increments, except
              for <b>-t</b>, which is in seconds; <b>-R</b>, which is in microseconds; <b>-p</b>,  which  is  in  units  of  512-byte
              blocks; <b>-P</b>, <b>-T</b>, <b>-b</b>, <b>-k</b>, <b>-n</b>, and <b>-u</b>, which are unscaled values; and, when in posix mode, <b>-c</b> and <b>-f</b>,
              which  are in 512-byte increments.  The return status is 0 unless an invalid option or argument is
              supplied, or an error occurs while setting a new limit.

       <b>umask</b> [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-S</b>] [<u>mode</u>]
              The user file-creation mask is set to <u>mode</u>.  If <u>mode</u> begins with a digit, it is interpreted as  an
              octal  number;  otherwise  it  is  interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar to that accepted by
              <u><a href="../man1/chmod.1.html">chmod</a></u>(1).  If <u>mode</u> is omitted, the current value of the mask is printed.  The <b>-S</b> option causes the
              mask to be printed in symbolic form; the default output is an octal number.  If the <b>-p</b>  option  is
              supplied,  and  <u>mode</u>  is omitted, the output is in a form that may be reused as input.  The return
              status is 0 if the mode was successfully changed or if no <u>mode</u> argument was  supplied,  and  false
              otherwise.

       <b>unalias</b> [-<b>a</b>] [<u>name</u> ...]
              Remove  each  <u>name</u> from the list of defined aliases.  If <b>-a</b> is supplied, all alias definitions are
              removed.  The return value is true unless a supplied <u>name</u> is not a defined alias.

       <b>unset</b> [-<b>fv</b>] [-<b>n</b>] [<u>name</u> ...]
              For each <u>name</u>, remove the corresponding variable or function.  If the <b>-v</b>  option  is  given,  each
              <u>name</u>  refers  to  a  shell variable, and that variable is removed.  Read-only variables may not be
              unset.  If <b>-f</b> is specified, each <u>name</u> refers to a shell function, and the function  definition  is
              removed.   If  the  <b>-n</b> option is supplied, and <u>name</u> is a variable with the <u>nameref</u> attribute, <u>name</u>
              will be unset rather than the variable it references.  <b>-n</b> has  no  effect  if  the  <b>-f</b>  option  is
              supplied.   If no options are supplied, each <u>name</u> refers to a variable; if there is no variable by
              that name, a function with that name, if any, is  unset.   Each  unset  variable  or  function  is
              removed  from  the environment passed to subsequent commands.  If any of <b>BASH_ALIASES</b>, <b>BASH_ARGV0</b>,
              <b>BASH_CMDS</b>,  <b>BASH_COMMAND</b>,  <b>BASH_SUBSHELL</b>,  <b>BASHPID</b>,  <b>COMP_WORDBREAKS</b>,   <b>DIRSTACK</b>,   <b>EPOCHREALTIME</b>,
              <b>EPOCHSECONDS</b>,  <b>FUNCNAME</b>, <b>GROUPS</b>, <b>HISTCMD</b>, <b>LINENO</b>, <b>RANDOM</b>, <b>SECONDS</b>, or <b>SRANDOM</b> are unset, they lose
              their special properties, even if they are subsequently reset.  The exit status is true  unless  a
              <u>name</u> is readonly or may not be unset.

       <b>wait</b> [<b>-fn</b>] [<b>-p</b> <u>varname</u>] [<u>id</u> <u>...</u>]
              Wait for each specified child process and return its termination status.  Each <u>id</u> may be a process
              ID or a job specification; if a job spec is given, all processes in that job's pipeline are waited
              for.  If <u>id</u> is not given, <b>wait</b> waits for all running background jobs and the last-executed process
              substitution,  if  its  process  id  is  the same as <b>$!</b>, and the return status is zero.  If the <b>-n</b>
              option is supplied, <b>wait</b> waits for a single job from the list of <u>id</u>s or, if no <u>id</u>s  are  supplied,
              any job, to complete and returns its exit status.  If none of the supplied arguments is a child of
              the  shell,  or  if no arguments are supplied and the shell has no unwaited-for children, the exit
              status is 127.  If the <b>-p</b> option is supplied, the process or job identifier of the job  for  which
              the exit status is returned is assigned to the variable <u>varname</u> named by the option argument.  The
              variable  will  be unset initially, before any assignment.  This is useful only when the <b>-n</b> option
              is supplied.  Supplying the <b>-f</b> option, when job control is enabled, forces <b>wait</b> to wait for <u>id</u>  to
              terminate  before  returning  its  status,  instead  of  returning  when it changes status.  If <u>id</u>
              specifies a non-existent process or job, the return status is 127.  If <b>wait</b> is  interrupted  by  a
              signal,  the  return  status  will  be  greater  than  128, as described under <b>SIGNALS</b> in <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</u>.
              Otherwise, the return status is the exit status of the last process or job waited for.

</pre><h4><b>SHELL</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       Bash-4.0 introduced the concept of a <u>shell</u> <u>compatibility</u> <u>level</u>, specified as a  set  of  options  to  the
       shopt  builtin  (  <b>compat31</b>,  <b>compat32</b>,  <b>compat40</b>,  <b>compat41</b>,  and  so  on).   There  is only one current
       compatibility level -- each option is mutually exclusive.  The compatibility level is intended  to  allow
       users  to  select  behavior  from  previous  versions that is incompatible with newer versions while they
       migrate scripts to use current features and behavior. It's intended to be a temporary solution.

       This section does not mention behavior that is standard for a particular version (e.g., setting  <b>compat32</b>
       means  that quoting the rhs of the regexp matching operator quotes special regexp characters in the word,
       which is default behavior in bash-3.2 and subsequent versions).

       If a user enables, say, <b>compat32</b>, it may affect the behavior of other  compatibility  levels  up  to  and
       including  the  current compatibility level.  The idea is that each compatibility level controls behavior
       that changed in that version of <b>bash</b>, but that behavior may have been present in earlier  versions.   For
       instance,  the  change  to use locale-based comparisons with the <b>[[</b> command came in bash-4.1, and earlier
       versions used ASCII-based comparisons, so enabling <b>compat32</b> will enable ASCII-based comparisons as  well.
       That  granularity  may  not be sufficient for all uses, and as a result users should employ compatibility
       levels carefully.  Read the documentation for a particular feature to find out the current behavior.

       Bash-4.3 introduced a new shell variable: <b>BASH_COMPAT</b>.  The value assigned to this  variable  (a  decimal
       version  number  like  4.2,  or  an integer corresponding to the <b>compat</b><u>NN</u> option, like 42) determines the
       compatibility level.

       Starting with bash-4.4, Bash has begun deprecating older compatibility levels.  Eventually,  the  options
       will be removed in favor of <b>BASH_COMPAT</b>.

       Bash-5.0  is  the  final  version  for  which  there  will be an individual shopt option for the previous
       version. Users should use <b>BASH_COMPAT</b> on bash-5.0 and later versions.

       The following table describes the behavior changes controlled by each compatibility level  setting.   The
       <b>compat</b><u>NN</u>  tag  is  used as shorthand for setting the compatibility level to <u>NN</u> using one of the following
       mechanisms.  For versions prior to bash-5.0, the compatibility level may be set using  the  corresponding
       <b>compat</b><u>NN</u> shopt option.  For bash-4.3 and later versions, the <b>BASH_COMPAT</b> variable is preferred, and it is
       required for bash-5.1 and later versions.

       <b>compat31</b>
              â€¢      quoting the rhs of the <b>[[</b> command's regexp matching operator (=~) has no special effect

       <b>compat32</b>
              â€¢      interrupting a command list such as "a ; b ; c" causes the execution of the next command in
                     the  list  (in bash-4.0 and later versions, the shell acts as if it received the interrupt,
                     so interrupting one command in a list aborts the execution of the entire list)

       <b>compat40</b>
              â€¢      the <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> operators to the <b>[[</b> command do not consider the current locale  when  comparing
                     strings;  they use ASCII ordering.  Bash versions prior to bash-4.1 use ASCII collation and
                     <u><a href="../man3/strcmp.3.html">strcmp</a></u>(3); bash-4.1 and later use the current locale's collation sequence and <u><a href="../man3/strcoll.3.html">strcoll</a></u>(3).

       <b>compat41</b>
              â€¢      in <u>posix</u> mode, <b>time</b> may be followed by options and still be recognized as a  reserved  word
                     (this is POSIX interpretation 267)
              â€¢      in  <u>posix</u>  mode, the parser requires that an even number of single quotes occur in the <u>word</u>
                     portion of  a  double-quoted  parameter  expansion  and  treats  them  specially,  so  that
                     characters  within  the  single  quotes are considered quoted (this is POSIX interpretation
                     221)

       <b>compat42</b>
              â€¢      the replacement string  in  double-quoted  pattern  substitution  does  not  undergo  quote
                     removal, as it does in versions after bash-4.2
              â€¢      in  posix  mode,  single quotes are considered special when expanding the <u>word</u> portion of a
                     double-quoted parameter expansion and can be used to quote a closing brace or other special
                     character (this is part of POSIX interpretation 221); in later versions, single quotes  are
                     not special within double-quoted word expansions

       <b>compat43</b>
              â€¢      the  shell  does not print a warning message if an attempt is made to use a quoted compound
                     assignment as an argument to declare (e.g., declare -a foo='(1 2)').  Later  versions  warn
                     that this usage is deprecated
              â€¢      word  expansion  errors  are  considered non-fatal errors that cause the current command to
                     fail, even in posix mode (the default behavior is to make them fatal errors that cause  the
                     shell to exit)
              â€¢      when  executing a shell function, the loop state (while/until/etc.)  is not reset, so <b>break</b>
                     or <b>continue</b> in that function will break or continue loops in the calling context.  Bash-4.4
                     and later reset the loop state to prevent this

       <b>compat44</b>
              â€¢      the  shell  sets  up  the  values used by <b>BASH_ARGV</b> and <b>BASH_ARGC</b> so they can expand to the
                     shell's positional parameters even if extended debugging mode is not enabled
              â€¢      a subshell inherits loops from its parent context, so <b>break</b>  or  <b>continue</b>  will  cause  the
                     subshell to exit.  Bash-5.0 and later reset the loop state to prevent the exit
              â€¢      variable  assignments  preceding  builtins  like  <b>export</b>  and  <b>readonly</b> that set attributes
                     continue to affect variables with the same name in the  calling  environment  even  if  the
                     shell is not in posix mode

       <b>compat50</b>
              â€¢      Bash-5.1 changed the way <b>$RANDOM</b> is generated to introduce slightly more randomness. If the
                     shell compatibility level is set to 50 or lower, it reverts to the method from bash-5.0 and
                     previous  versions,  so  seeding the random number generator by assigning a value to <b>RANDOM</b>
                     will produce the same sequence as in bash-5.0
              â€¢      If  the  command  hash  table  is  empty,  bash  versions  prior  to  bash-5.1  printed  an
                     informational  message  to  that  effect,  even when producing output that can be reused as
                     input. Bash-5.1 suppresses that message when the <b>-l</b> option is supplied.

       <b>compat51</b>
              â€¢      The <b>unset</b> builtin treats attempts to unset array subscripts <b>@</b> and <b>*</b>  differently  depending
                     on whether the array is indexed or associative, and differently than in previous versions.
