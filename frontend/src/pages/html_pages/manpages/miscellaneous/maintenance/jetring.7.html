       jetring - maintenance of gpg keyrings using changesets

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       jetring  is  a  collection of tools that allow for gpg keyrings to be maintained using changesets. It was
       developed with the Debian keyring in mind, and aims to solve the problem that a gpg keyring is  a  binary
       blob that's hard for multiple people to collaboratively edit.

       With  jetring,  changesets can be submitted, reviewed to see exactly what they will do, applied, and used
       to build a keyring. The origin of every change made to the keyring is available  for  auditing,  and  gpg
       signatures can be used to further secure things.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       A  jetring  directory  is  used as the "source" that a keyring is built from.  To convert an existing gpg
       keyring to such a directory, use the <b><a href="../man1/jetring-explode.1.html">jetring-explode</a></b>(1) command.

       Each change to the gpg keyring is stored in a separate changeset file in the  directory.  Changesets  can
       reflect  any set of changes to the keyring.  Changesets can also include arbitrary metadata. The <b><a href="../man1/jetringgen.1.html">jetring-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man1/jetringgen.1.html">gen</a></b>(1) command can be used to compare two keyrings and generate a changeset from one to the other.

       Changesets are never removed or modified, only new ones added, using the <b><a href="../man1/jetring-accept.1.html">jetring-accept</a></b>(1) command.

       There's an ordering of the changesets. This ordering is stored in an index file. The index file  is  only
       appended to, to add new changesets.

       Changesets can be fully examined to see what change they make before applying them. The <b><a href="../man1/jetring-review.1.html">jetring-review</a></b>(1)
       and <b><a href="../man1/jetring-diff.1.html">jetring-diff</a></b>(1) commands can be used for such review.

       To  create  a  new  keyring, or incrementally update an existing keyring, changesets are applied in order
       using the <b><a href="../man1/jetring-build.1.html">jetring-build</a></b>(1) command.

</pre><h4><b>GPG</b> <b>SIGNATURES</b></h4><pre>
       The index file can optionally be gpg signed (the signature will be stored in index.gpg); if  JETRING_SIGN
       is set to point to a gpg keyring, then jetring commands that operate on the jetring directory will always
       check  that  the  index  file  is signed with one of the keys from that keyring. Commands that modify the
       index file will update its signature.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGESET</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       A changeset file consists of one or  more  stanzas,  separated  by  blank  lines.   The  stanzas  are  in
       RFC-822-like  format.  Each stanza must have an action field, which specifies which action to take on the
       keyring, and a data field, typically a multi-line field, which contains the data to feed to  the  action.
       Supported actions are:

       <b>import</b> The data field should be an ascii-armored gpg key block, that is fed into gpg --import.

       <b>edit-key</b> <b>keyid</b>
              gpg  --edit-key  is  run  on  the specified key id. The data field is a script, each line in it is
              passed in to gpg, the same as if gpg were being driven interactively. This can  be  used  to  make
              arbitrary changes to the key.

       <b>delete-key</b> <b>keyid</b>
              The  given  key  is  deleted.  The data is fed into gpg --delete-key, and should be "y", since gpg
              expects that confirmation to deleting a key.

       Other fields can be added as desired to hold  metadata  about  the  change.   Typical  additional  fields
       include date, changed-by, and comment.

       Changesets  can be optionally have attached signatures, although such data is not automatically validated
       and is mostly useful to record who submitted or signed off on a given changeset.
