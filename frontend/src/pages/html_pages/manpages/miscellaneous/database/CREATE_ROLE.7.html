           | SYSID <u>uid</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>CREATE</b> <b>ROLE</b> adds a new role to a PostgreSQL database cluster. A role is an entity that can own database
       objects and have database privileges; a role can be considered a “user”, a “group”, or both depending on
       how it is used. Refer to Chapter 21 and Chapter 20 for information about managing users and
       authentication. You must have CREATEROLE privilege or be a database superuser to use this command.

       Note that roles are defined at the database cluster level, and so are valid in all databases in the
       cluster.

       During role creation it is possible to immediately assign the newly created role to be a member of an
       existing role, and also assign existing roles to be members of the newly created role. The rules for
       which initial role membership options are enabled are described below in the IN ROLE, ROLE, and ADMIN
       clauses. The <b><a href="../man7/GRANT.7.html">GRANT</a></b>(7) command has fine-grained option control during membership creation, and the ability
       to modify these options after the new role is created.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>name</u>
           The name of the new role.

       SUPERUSER
       NOSUPERUSER
           These clauses determine whether the new role is a “superuser”, who can override all access
           restrictions within the database. Superuser status is dangerous and should be used only when really
           needed. You must yourself be a superuser to create a new superuser. If not specified, NOSUPERUSER is
           the default.

       CREATEDB
       NOCREATEDB
           These clauses define a role's ability to create databases. If CREATEDB is specified, the role being
           defined will be allowed to create new databases. Specifying NOCREATEDB will deny a role the ability
           to create databases. If not specified, NOCREATEDB is the default. Only superuser roles or roles with
           CREATEDB can specify CREATEDB.

       CREATEROLE
       NOCREATEROLE
           These clauses determine whether a role will be permitted to create, alter, drop, comment on, and
           change the security label for other roles. See role creation for more details about what capabilities
           are conferred by this privilege. If not specified, NOCREATEROLE is the default.

       INHERIT
       NOINHERIT
           This affects the membership inheritance status when this role is added as a member of another role,
           both in this and future commands. Specifically, it controls the inheritance status of memberships
           added with this command using the IN ROLE clause, and in later commands using the ROLE clause. It is
           also used as the default inheritance status when adding this role as a member using the GRANT
           command. If not specified, INHERIT is the default.

           In PostgreSQL versions before 16, inheritance was a role-level attribute that controlled all runtime
           membership checks for that role.

       LOGIN
       NOLOGIN
           These clauses determine whether a role is allowed to log in; that is, whether the role can be given
           as the initial session authorization name during client connection. A role having the LOGIN attribute
           can be thought of as a user. Roles without this attribute are useful for managing database
           privileges, but are not users in the usual sense of the word. If not specified, NOLOGIN is the
           default, except when <b>CREATE</b> <b>ROLE</b> is invoked through its alternative spelling <b>CREATE</b> <b>USER</b>.

       REPLICATION
       NOREPLICATION
           These clauses determine whether a role is a replication role. A role must have this attribute (or be
           a superuser) in order to be able to connect to the server in replication mode (physical or logical
           replication) and in order to be able to create or drop replication slots. A role having the
           REPLICATION attribute is a very highly privileged role, and should only be used on roles actually
           used for replication. If not specified, NOREPLICATION is the default. Only superuser roles or roles
           with REPLICATION can specify REPLICATION.

       BYPASSRLS
       NOBYPASSRLS
           These clauses determine whether a role bypasses every row-level security (RLS) policy.  NOBYPASSRLS
           is the default. Only superuser roles or roles with BYPASSRLS can specify BYPASSRLS.

           Note that pg_dump will set row_security to OFF by default, to ensure all contents of a table are
           dumped out. If the user running pg_dump does not have appropriate permissions, an error will be
           returned. However, superusers and the owner of the table being dumped always bypass RLS.

       CONNECTION LIMIT <u>connlimit</u>
           If role can log in, this specifies how many concurrent connections the role can make. -1 (the
           default) means no limit. Note that only normal connections are counted towards this limit. Neither
           prepared transactions nor background worker connections are counted towards this limit.

       [ ENCRYPTED ] PASSWORD '<u>password</u>'
       PASSWORD NULL
           Sets the role's password. (A password is only of use for roles having the LOGIN attribute, but you
           can nonetheless define one for roles without it.) If you do not plan to use password authentication
           you can omit this option. If no password is specified, the password will be set to null and password
           authentication will always fail for that user. A null password can optionally be written explicitly
           as PASSWORD NULL.

               <b>Note</b>
               Specifying an empty string will also set the password to null, but that was not the case before
               PostgreSQL version 10. In earlier versions, an empty string could be used, or not, depending on
               the authentication method and the exact version, and libpq would refuse to use it in any case. To
               avoid the ambiguity, specifying an empty string should be avoided.
           The password is always stored encrypted in the system catalogs. The ENCRYPTED keyword has no effect,
           but is accepted for backwards compatibility. The method of encryption is determined by the
           configuration parameter password_encryption. If the presented password string is already in
           MD5-encrypted or SCRAM-encrypted format, then it is stored as-is regardless of <u>password_encryption</u>
           (since the system cannot decrypt the specified encrypted password string, to encrypt it in a
           different format). This allows reloading of encrypted passwords during dump/restore.

       VALID UNTIL '<u>timestamp</u>'
           The VALID UNTIL clause sets a date and time after which the role's password is no longer valid. If
           this clause is omitted the password will be valid for all time.

       IN ROLE <u>role_name</u>
           The IN ROLE clause causes the new role to be automatically added as a member of the specified
           existing roles. The new membership will have the SET option enabled and the ADMIN option disabled.
           The INHERIT option will be enabled unless the NOINHERIT option is specified.

       ROLE <u>role_name</u>
           The ROLE clause causes one or more specified existing roles to be automatically added as members,
           with the SET option enabled. This in effect makes the new role a “group”. Roles named in this clause
           with the role-level INHERIT attribute will have the INHERIT option enabled in the new membership. New
           memberships will have the ADMIN option disabled.

       ADMIN <u>role_name</u>
           The ADMIN clause has the same effect as ROLE, but the named roles are added as members of the new
           role with ADMIN enabled, giving them the right to grant membership in the new role to others.

       SYSID <u>uid</u>
           The SYSID clause is ignored, but is accepted for backwards compatibility.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Use <b>ALTER</b> <b>ROLE</b> to change the attributes of a role, and <b>DROP</b> <b>ROLE</b> to remove a role. All the attributes
       specified by <b>CREATE</b> <b>ROLE</b> can be modified by later <b>ALTER</b> <b>ROLE</b> commands.

       The preferred way to add and remove members of roles that are being used as groups is to use <b>GRANT</b> and
       <b>REVOKE</b>.

       The VALID UNTIL clause defines an expiration time for a password only, not for the role per se. In
       particular, the expiration time is not enforced when logging in using a non-password-based authentication
       method.

       The role attributes defined here are non-inheritable, i.e., being a member of a role with, e.g., CREATEDB
       will not allow the member to create new databases even if the membership grant has the INHERIT option. Of
       course, if the membership grant has the SET option the member role would be able to <b>SET</b> <b>ROLE</b> to the
       createdb role and then create a new database.

       The membership grants created by the IN ROLE, ROLE, and ADMIN clauses have the role executing this
       command as the grantor.

       The INHERIT attribute is the default for reasons of backwards compatibility: in prior releases of
       PostgreSQL, users always had access to all privileges of groups they were members of. However, NOINHERIT
       provides a closer match to the semantics specified in the SQL standard.

       PostgreSQL includes a program <b><a href="../man1/createuser.1.html">createuser</a></b>(1) that has the same functionality as <b>CREATE</b> <b>ROLE</b> (in fact, it
       calls this command) but can be run from the command shell.

       The CONNECTION LIMIT option is only enforced approximately; if two new sessions start at about the same
       time when just one connection “slot” remains for the role, it is possible that both will fail. Also, the
       limit is never enforced for superusers.

       Caution must be exercised when specifying an unencrypted password with this command. The password will be
       transmitted to the server in cleartext, and it might also be logged in the client's command history or
       the server log. The command <b><a href="../man1/createuser.1.html">createuser</a></b>(1), however, transmits the password encrypted. Also, <b><a href="../man1/psql.1.html">psql</a></b>(1)
       contains a command <b>\password</b> that can be used to safely change the password later.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Create a role that can log in, but don't give it a password:

           CREATE ROLE jonathan LOGIN;

       Create a role with a password:

           CREATE USER davide WITH PASSWORD 'jw8s0F4';

       (<b>CREATE</b> <b>USER</b> is the same as <b>CREATE</b> <b>ROLE</b> except that it implies LOGIN.)

       Create a role with a password that is valid until the end of 2004. After one second has ticked in 2005,
       the password is no longer valid.

           CREATE ROLE miriam WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'jw8s0F4' VALID UNTIL '2005-01-01';

       Create a role that can create databases and manage roles:

           CREATE ROLE admin WITH CREATEDB CREATEROLE;

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>CREATE</b> <b>ROLE</b> statement is in the SQL standard, but the standard only requires the syntax

           CREATE ROLE <u>name</u> [ WITH ADMIN <u>role_name</u> ]

       Multiple initial administrators, and all the other options of <b>CREATE</b> <b>ROLE</b>, are PostgreSQL extensions.

       The SQL standard defines the concepts of users and roles, but it regards them as distinct concepts and
       leaves all commands defining users to be specified by each database implementation. In PostgreSQL we have
       chosen to unify users and roles into a single kind of entity. Roles therefore have many more optional
       attributes than they do in the standard.

       The behavior specified by the SQL standard is most closely approximated creating SQL-standard users as
       PostgreSQL roles with the NOINHERIT option, and SQL-standard roles as PostgreSQL roles with the INHERIT
       option.

       The USER clause has the same behavior as ROLE but has been deprecated:

           USER <u>role_name</u> [, ...]

       The IN GROUP clause has the same behavior as IN ROLE but has been deprecated:

           IN GROUP <u>role_name</u> [, ...]
