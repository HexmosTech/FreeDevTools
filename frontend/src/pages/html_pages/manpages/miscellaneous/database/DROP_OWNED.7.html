</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DROP_OWNED - remove database objects owned by a database role

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       DROP OWNED BY { <u>name</u> | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER } [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DROP</b> <b>OWNED</b> drops all the objects within the current database that are owned by one of the specified
       roles. Any privileges granted to the given roles on objects in the current database or on shared objects
       (databases, tablespaces, configuration parameters) will also be revoked.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>name</u>
           The name of a role whose objects will be dropped, and whose privileges will be revoked.

       CASCADE
           Automatically drop objects that depend on the affected objects, and in turn all objects that depend
           on those objects (see Section 5.15).

       RESTRICT
           Refuse to drop the objects owned by a role if any other database objects depend on one of the
           affected objects. This is the default.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DROP</b> <b>OWNED</b> is often used to prepare for the removal of one or more roles. Because <b>DROP</b> <b>OWNED</b> only affects
       the objects in the current database, it is usually necessary to execute this command in each database
       that contains objects owned by a role that is to be removed.

       Using the CASCADE option might make the command recurse to objects owned by other users.

       The <b>REASSIGN</b> <b>OWNED</b> command is an alternative that reassigns the ownership of all the database objects
       owned by one or more roles. However, <b>REASSIGN</b> <b>OWNED</b> does not deal with privileges for other objects.

       Databases and tablespaces owned by the role(s) will not be removed.

       See Section 21.4 for more discussion.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>DROP</b> <b>OWNED</b> command is a PostgreSQL extension.
