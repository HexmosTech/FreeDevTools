       vsl-query - Varnish VSL Query Expressions

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       The  Varnish  VSL Query Expressions extracts transactions from the Varnish shared memory log, and perform
       queries on the transactions before reporting matches.

       A transaction is a set of log lines that belongs together, e.g. a client request or  a  backend  request.
       The  API  monitors  the  log, and collects all log records that make up a transaction before reporting on
       that transaction. Transactions can also be grouped, meaning backend transactions  are  reported  together
       with the client transaction that initiated it.

       A query is run on a group of transactions. A query expression is true if there is a log record within the
       group  that satisfies the condition. It is false only if none of the log records satisfies the condition.
       Query expressions can be combined using boolean functions.  In addition to log records, it is possible to
       query transaction ids (vxid) in query.

</pre><h4><b>GROUPING</b></h4><pre>
       When grouping transactions, there is a hierarchy structure showing which transaction initiated what.  The
       level  increases by one on an 'initiated by' relation, so for example a backend transaction will have one
       higher level than the client transaction that initiated it on a cache miss. Request restart  transactions
       don't get their level increased to make it predictable.

       Levels start counting at 1, except when using raw where it will always be 0.

       The grouping modes are:

       • <b>session</b>

         All  transactions  initiated  by a client connection are reported together. Client connections are open
         ended when using HTTP keep-alives, so it is undefined  when  the  session  will  be  reported.  If  the
         transaction  timeout  period is exceeded an incomplete session will be reported. Non-transactional data
         (vxid == 0) is not reported.

       • <b>request</b>

         Transactions are grouped by request, where the set will include the  request  itself  as  well  as  any
         backend  requests  or  ESI-subrequests.   Session  data  and  non-transactional data (vxid == 0) is not
         reported.

       • <b>vxid</b>

         Transactions are  not  grouped,  so  each  vxid  is  reported  in  its  entirety.  Sessions,  requests,
         ESI-requests and backend requests are all reported individually. Non-transactional data is not reported
         (vxid == 0). This is the default.

       • <b>raw</b>

         Every log record will make up a transaction of its own. All data, including non-transactional data will
         be reported.

   <b>Transaction</b> <b>Hierarchy</b>
       Example transaction hierarchy using request grouping mode

          Lvl 1: Client request (cache miss)
            Lvl 2: Backend request
            Lvl 2: ESI subrequest (cache miss)
              Lvl 3: Backend request
              Lvl 3: Backend request (VCL restart)
              Lvl 3: ESI subrequest (cache miss)
                Lvl 4: Backend request
            Lvl 2: ESI subrequest (cache hit)

</pre><h4><b>MEMORY</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  API  will  use  pointers  to  shared  memory  log data as long as possible to keep memory usage at a
       minimum. But as the shared memory log is a ring buffer, data will get overwritten eventually, so the  API
       creates  local  copies  of  referenced log data when varnishd comes close to overwriting still unreported
       content.

       This process avoids loss of log data in many scenarios, but it is not failsafe: Overruns  where  varnishd
       "overtakes"  the  log  reader process in the ring buffer can still happen when API clients cannot keep up
       reading and/or copying, for instance due to output blocking.

       Though being unrelated to grouping in principle, copying of log data is particularly relevant for session
       grouping together with long lasting client connections -  for  this  grouping,  the  logging  API  client
       process is likely to consume relevant amounts of memory. As the vxid grouping also logs (potentially long
       lasting)  sessions,  it  is  also  likely  to require memory for copies of log entries, but far less than
       session grouping.

</pre><h4><b>QUERY</b> <b>LANGUAGE</b></h4><pre>
       A query expression consists of record selection criteria, and optionally an operator and a value to match
       against the selected records.

          &lt;record selection criteria&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;operand&gt;

       Additionally, a query expression can occur on the transaction itself rather than log records belonging to
       the transaction.

          vxid &lt;numerical operator&gt; &lt;integer&gt;

       A <b>vxid</b> query allows you to directly target a specific transaction, whose  id  can  be  obtained  from  an
       <b>X-Varnish</b> HTTP header, the default "guru meditation" error page, or <b>Begin</b> and <b>Link</b> log records.

       A  query  must  fit  on a single line, but it is possible to pass multiple queries at once, one query per
       line. Empty lines are ignored, and the list of queries is treated as if the 'or'  operator  was  used  to
       combine them.

       For example this list of queries:

          # catch varnish errors
          *Error

          # catch backend errors
          BerespStatus &gt;= 500

       is identical to this query:

          (*Error) or (BerespStatus &gt;= 500)

       Comments  can  be  used  and will be ignored, they start with the <b>'#'</b> character, which may be more useful
       when the query is read from a file.

       For very long queries that couldn't easily be split into multiple queries it is possible  to  break  them
       into multiple lines with a backslash preceding an end of line.

       For example this query:

          BerespStatus &gt;= 500

       is identical to this query:

          BerespStatus \
          &gt;= \
          500

       A  backslash-newline  sequence  doesn't continue a comment on the next line and isn't allowed in a quoted
       string.

   <b>Record</b> <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b>
       The record selection criteria determines what kind records from  the  transaction  group  the  expression
       applies to. Syntax:

          {level}taglist:record-prefix[field]

       Taglist is mandatory, the other components are optional.

       The  level  limits  the expression to a transaction at that level. If left unspecified, the expression is
       applied to transactions at all levels. Level is a positive integer or zero. If level is followed by a '+'
       character, it expresses greater than or equal. If level is followed by a '-', it expresses less  than  or
       equal.

       The  taglist is a comma-separated list of VSL record tags that this expression should be checked against.
       Each list element can be a tag name or a tag glob. Globs allow a '*' either in the beginning of the  name
       or  at  the  end,  and  will select all tags that match either the prefix or subscript. A single '*' will
       select all tags.

       The record prefix will further limit the matches to those records that has this  prefix  as  their  first
       part  of  the record content followed by a colon. The part of the log record matched against will then be
       limited to what follows the prefix and colon. This is useful when matching against specific HTTP headers.
       The record prefix matching is done case insensitive.

       The field will, if present, treat the log record as a white space separated list of fields, and only  the
       nth part of the record will be matched against. Fields start counting at 1.

       An  expression  using  only  a  record  selection  criteria  will  be  true if there is any record in the
       transaction group that is selected by the criteria.

   <b>Operators</b>
       The following matching operators are available:

       • == != &lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;=

         Numerical comparison. The record contents will be converted to either an  integer  or  a  float  before
         comparison, depending on the type of the operand.

       • eq ne

         String comparison. 'eq' tests string equality, 'ne' tests for not equality.

       • ~ !~

         Regular expression matching. '~' is a positive match, '!~' is a non-match.

   <b>Operand</b>
       The operand is the value the selected records will be matched against.

       An  operand  can  be  quoted  or  unquoted.  Quotes can be either single or double quotes, and for quoted
       operands a backslash can be used to escape the quotes.

       Unquoted operands can only consist of the following characters:

          a-z A-Z 0-9 + - _ . *

       The following types of operands are available:

       • Integer

         A number without any fractional part, valid for the numerical comparison operators. The integer type is
         used when the operand does not contain any period (.) nor  exponent  (e)  characters.  However  if  the
         record evaluates as a float, only its integral part is used for the comparison.

       • Float

         A  number  with a fractional part, valid for the numerical comparison operators. The float type is used
         when the operand does contain a period (.) or exponent (e) character.

       • String

         A sequence of characters, valid for the string equality operators.

       • Regular expression

         A PCRE2 regular expression. Valid for the regular expression operators.

   <b>Boolean</b> <b>functions</b>
       Query expressions can be linked together  using  boolean  functions.  The  following  are  available,  in
       decreasing precedence:

       • not &lt;expr&gt;

         Inverts the result of &lt;expr&gt;

       • &lt;expr1&gt; and &lt;expr2&gt;

         True only if both expr1 and expr2 are true

       • &lt;expr1&gt; or &lt;expr2&gt;

         True if either of expr1 or expr2 is true

       Expressions can be grouped using parenthesis.

       • Transaction group contains a request URL that equals to "/foo"

            ReqURL eq "/foo"

       • Transaction group contains a request cookie header

            ReqHeader:cookie

       • Transaction group doesn't contain a request cookie header

            not ReqHeader:cookie

       • Client request where internal handling took more than 800ms.:

            Timestamp:Process[2] &gt; 0.8

       • Transaction  group  contains  a request user-agent header that contains "iPod" and the request delivery
         time exceeds 1 second

       • Transaction group contains a backend response status larger than or equal to 500

            BerespStatus &gt;= 500

       • Transaction group contains a request response status of 304, but where the request did not  contain  an
         if-modified-since header

            RespStatus == 304 and not ReqHeader:if-modified-since

       • Transactions  that  have  had backend failures or long delivery time on their ESI subrequests. (Assumes
         request grouping mode).

            BerespStatus &gt;= 500 or {2+}Timestamp:Process[2] &gt; 1.

       • Log non-transactional errors. (Assumes raw grouping mode).

            vxid == 0 and Error
