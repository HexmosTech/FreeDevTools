</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       flaw - a Lua OO management framework for awesome WM widgets

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>flaw</b>  stands  for Fully Loaded AWesome.  It is a LUA object oriented library providing a thin abstraction
       layer above awesome widgets.  It is aimed at being simple and resources efficient.

       To achieve these goals, <b>flaw</b> provides the following concepts.

       gadgets
              To add functionality to awesome widgets, <b>flaw</b> defines gadget objects, which are a wrapper around a
              widget.  All gadgets have properties, events, a refresh mechanism and a data provider (see below).
              Gadgets can wrap all awesome widget type, namely text boxes, image boxes, graphs or progress bars.
              <b>flaw</b> provides many gadgets for common system information (like CPU or memory activity).

       provider
              <b>flaw</b> tries to minimise system access and data refresh.  Since all information do not have the same
              expiration rate, all gadgets refresh independently.  And since some gadgets can share information,
              all data is provided by providers which can be shared among gadgets.   Providers  maintain  status
              data  from  the  system  and  refreshes only when necessary (ie. when the gadget with the shortest
              refresh rate demands it).

       events Events are a way for the user to modify the gadget behaviour or properties  when  some  conditions
              are  met.   An event is composed of a trigger, which computes the condition, and an action.  Event
              triggers are tested by the providers only when data changes.  Both the condition  and  the  action
              are provided by the user.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>flaw</b> depends on the lua-filesystem package which can be found <u><a href="http://luaforge.net/projects/luafilesystem">http://luaforge.net/projects/luafilesystem</a></u>.
       Once  installed, the following statement must be inserted in awesome configuration before any <b>flaw</b> gadget
       or mechanism is used.
              require('flaw')

       Using <b>flaw</b> consists in creating gadgets, passing them parameters to customize their display and events to
       add some behaviour to them, and then adding them in a wibox like any  other  awesome  widget.   <b>flaw</b>  and
       awful gadgets can live together. The complete <b>flaw</b> documentation is available in Luadoc format. Enter the
       following command to generate it.
              LUA_PATH="path_toflaw/doclet/html/?;;" luadoc -d html --nofiles *.lua

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>flaw</b>  tries  to  recover  upon bad invocations.  When something wrong occurs, it outputs warning or error
       messages to stderr (for example,  if  awesome  was  started  with  xsession,  output  will  be  found  in
       <u><a href="file:~/.xsession-errors">~/.xsession-errors</a></u> ).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Certainly a lot.
