       FunDS9 - Funtools and DS9 Image Display

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Describes how funtools can be integrated into the ds9 Analysis menu.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       SAOImage/DS9 is an astronomical imaging and data visualization application used by astronomers around the
       world.   DS9  can  display  standard astronomical FITS images and binary tables, but also has support for
       displaying raw array files, shared memory files, and data files automatically retrieved via FTP and HTTP.
       Standard functional capabilities include multiple frame buffers, colormap and  region  manipulation,  and
       many data scaling algorithms. DS9's advanced features include TrueColor visuals, deep frame buffers, true
       PostScript  printing,  and  display  of image mosaics. The program's support of image tiling, "blinking",
       arbitrary zoom, rotation, and pan is unparalleled in  astronomy.  It  also  has  innovative  support  for
       automatic  retrieval  and display of standard image data such as the Digital Sky Survey (using servers at
       SAO, StScI, or ESO).

       DS9 can communicate with external programs such as Funtools using the XPA messaging system.  In addition,
       programs can be integrated directly into the DS9 GUI by  means  of  a  configurable  Analysis  menu.   By
       default,  the  DS9 Analysis menu contains algorithms deemed essential to the core functions of DS9, e.g.,
       display cross-cuts of data, iso-intensity contours, and WCS grids. However, new programs can be added  to
       DS9 by creating a set-up file which can be loaded into DS9 to reconfigure the Analysis menu.

       The basic format of the analysis set-up file is:

         #
         # Analysis command descriptions:
         #   menu label/description
         #   file templates for this command
         #   "menu" (add to menu) ⎪"bind" (bind to key)
         #   analysis command line

       For example, the funcnts program can be specified in this way:

         Funcnts (counts in source/bkgd regions; options: none)
         *
         menu
         funcnts $filename $regions(source,,) $regions(background,,) ⎪ $text

       As  shown  above, DS9 supports a macro facility to provide information as well as task support to command
       lines. For example, the $regions macro is expanded by DS9 to provide the current source and/or background
       region to the analysis command. The $text macro is expanded to generate a text window display. It also is
       possible to query for parameters using a $param macro, plot data using a $plot macro, etc.  See  the  DS9
       documentation for further details.

       A  set-up file called funtools.ds9 will load some useful Funtools applications (counts in regions, radial
       profile, X-ray light curve and energy spectrum, 1D histogram) into the DS9 Analysis menu (version 2.1 and
       above).  The file resides in the bin directory where Funtools programs are installed. It can be  manually
       loaded  into DS9 from the <b>Load</b> <b>Analysis</b> <b>Commands</b> <b>...</b> option of the <b>Analysis</b> menu.  Alternatively, you can
       tell  DS9  to  load  this  file  automatically  at  start-up  time  by  adding  the   pathname   to   the
       <b>Edit</b>-&gt;<b>Preferences</b>-&gt;<b>Analysis</b>   <b>Menu</b>-&gt;Analysis   File   menu   option.    (NB:   make   sure   you   select
       <b>Edit</b>-&gt;<b>Preferences</b>-&gt;<b>Save</b> <b>Preferences</b> after setting the pathname.)

       The tasks in this setup file generally process the original disk-based FITS file.  Funcnts-based  results
       (radial  profile,  counts  in  regions)  are  presented  in WCS units, if present in the FITS header. For
       situations where a disk file is not available (e.g., image data generated and sent to  DS9's  'fits'  XPA
       access point), versions of the radial profile and counts in regions tasks also are also offered utilizing
       DS9's  internal image data. Results are presented in pixels.  Aside from the units, the results should be
       identical to the file-based results.
