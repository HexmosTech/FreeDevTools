</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ossl_store-file - The store 'file' scheme loader

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;openssl/store.h&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Support for the 'file' scheme is built into "libcrypto".  Since files come in all kinds of formats and
       content types, the 'file' scheme has its own layer of functionality called "file handlers", which are
       used to try to decode diverse types of file contents.

       In case a file is formatted as PEM, each called file handler receives the PEM name (everything following
       any '"-----BEGIN "') as well as possible PEM headers, together with the decoded PEM body.  Since PEM
       formatted files can contain more than one object, the file handlers are called upon for each such object.

       If the file isn't determined to be formatted as PEM, the content is loaded in raw form in its entirety
       and passed to the available file handlers as is, with no PEM name or headers.

       Each file handler is expected to handle PEM and non-PEM content as appropriate.  Some may refuse non-PEM
       content for the sake of determinism (for example, there are keys out in the wild that are represented as
       an ASN.1 OCTET STRING.  In raw form, it's not easily possible to distinguish those from any other data
       coming as an ASN.1 OCTET STRING, so such keys would naturally be accepted as PEM files only).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       When needed, the 'file' scheme loader will require a pass phrase by using the <b>UI_METHOD</b> that was passed
       via <b>OSSL_STORE_open()</b>.  This pass phrase is expected to be UTF-8 encoded, anything else will give an
       undefined result.  The files made accessible through this loader are expected to be standard compliant
       with regards to pass phrase encoding.  Files that aren't should be re-generated with a correctly encoded
       pass phrase.  See <b><a href="../man7/passphrase-encoding.7.html">passphrase-encoding</a></b>(7) for more information.
