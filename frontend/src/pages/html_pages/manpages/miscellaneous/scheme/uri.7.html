</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  Uniform  Resource Identifier (URI) is a short string of characters identifying an abstract or physical
       resource (for example, a web page).  A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a URI that identifies a resource
       through its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network "location"), rather than by name  or  some  other
       attribute  of that resource.  A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a URI that must remain globally unique and
       persistent even when the resource ceases to exist or becomes unavailable.

       URIs are the standard way to name hypertext link destinations for tools such as web browsers.  The string
       "<a href="http://www.kernel.org">http://www.kernel.org</a>" is a URL (and thus it is also a URI).  Many people use the term URL loosely as  a
       synonym for URI (though technically URLs are a subset of URIs).

       URIs  can  be  absolute or relative.  An absolute identifier refers to a resource independent of context,
       while a relative identifier refers to a resource by describing the difference from the  current  context.
       Within  a  relative  path  reference, the complete path segments "." and ".." have special meanings: "the
       current hierarchy level" and "the level above this hierarchy level", respectively, just like they  do  in
       UNIX-like systems.  A path segment which contains a colon character can't be used as the first segment of
       a  relative  URI  path  (e.g., "this:that"), because it would be mistaken for a scheme name; precede such
       segments with ./ (e.g., "./this:that").  Note  that  descendants  of  MS-DOS  (e.g.,  Microsoft  Windows)
       replace devicename colons with the vertical bar ("|") in URIs, so "C:" becomes "C|".

       A  fragment  identifier, if included, refers to a particular named portion (fragment) of a resource; text
       after a '#' identifies the fragment.  A URI beginning with '#' refers to that  fragment  in  the  current
       resource.

   <b>Usage</b>
       There  are  many  different  URI  schemes, each with specific additional rules and meanings, but they are
       intentionally made to be as similar as possible.  For example, many URL schemes permit the  authority  to
       be the following format, called here an <u>ip_server</u> (square brackets show what's optional):

       <u>ip_server</u> <u>=</u> [<u>user</u> [ : <u>password</u> ] @ ] <u>host</u> [ : <u>port</u>]

       This  format allows you to optionally insert a username, a user plus password, and/or a port number.  The
       <u>host</u> is the name of the host computer, either its name as determined by DNS or  an  IP  address  (numbers
       separated  by periods).  Thus the URI &lt;<a href="http://fred">http://fred</a>:<a href="mailto:fredpassword@example.com">fredpassword@example.com</a>:8080/&gt; logs into a web server
       on host example.com as fred (using fredpassword) using port 8080.  Avoid including a password in a URI if
       possible because of the many security risks of having a password written down.  If  the  URL  supplies  a
       username  but  no  password,  and the remote server requests a password, the program interpreting the URL
       should request one from the user.

       Here are some of the most common schemes in use on UNIX-like systems that are understood by  many  tools.
       Note  that  many  tools  using  URIs  also have internal schemes or specialized schemes; see those tools'
       documentation for information on those schemes.

       <b>http</b> <b>-</b> <b>Web</b> <b>(HTTP)</b> <b>server</b>

       http://<u>ip_server</u>/<u>path</u>
       http://<u>ip_server</u>/<u>path</u>?<u>query</u>

       This is a URL accessing a web (HTTP) server.  The default port is 80.  If the path refers to a directory,
       the web server will choose what to return; usually if there is a file named "index.html"  or  "index.htm"
       its content is returned, otherwise, a list of the files in the current directory (with appropriate links)
       is generated and returned.  An example is &lt;<a href="http://lwn.net">http://lwn.net</a>&gt;.

       A query can be given in the archaic "isindex" format, consisting of a word or phrase and not including an
       equal  sign  (=).  A query can also be in the longer "GET" format, which has one or more query entries of
       the form <u>key</u>=<u>value</u> separated by the ampersand character (&amp;).  Note that <u>key</u> can  be  repeated  more  than
       once,  though  it's up to the web server and its application programs to determine if there's any meaning
       to that.  There is an unfortunate interaction with HTML/XML/SGML and the GET query format; when such URIs
       with more than one key are embedded in SGML/XML documents (including HTML), the ampersand (&amp;) has  to  be
       rewritten  as &amp;amp;.  Note that not all queries use this format; larger forms may be too long to store as
       a URI, so they use a different interaction mechanism (called POST) which does not include the data in the
       URI.  See the Common Gateway Interface specification at <a href="http://www.w3.org/CGI">http://www.w3.org/CGI</a> for more information.

       <b>ftp</b> <b>-</b> <b>File</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(FTP)</b>

       ftp://<u>ip_server</u>/<u>path</u>

       This is a URL accessing a file through the file transfer protocol (FTP).  The default port (for  control)
       is  21.   If no username is included, the username "anonymous" is supplied, and in that case many clients
       provide   as   the   password   the   requestor's   Internet    email    address.     An    example    is
       &lt;<a href="ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1808.txt">ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1808.txt</a>&gt;.

       <b>gopher</b> <b>-</b> <b>Gopher</b> <b>server</b>

       gopher://<u>ip_server</u>/<u>gophertype</u> <u>selector</u>
       gopher://<u>ip_server</u>/<u>gophertype</u> <u>selector</u>%09<u>search</u>
       gopher://<u>ip_server</u>/<u>gophertype</u> <u>selector</u>%09<u>search</u>%09<u>gopher+_string</u>

       The  default  gopher port is 70.  <u>gophertype</u> is a single-character field to denote the Gopher type of the
       resource to which the URL refers.  The entire path may also be empty, in which case the delimiting "/" is
       also optional and the gophertype defaults to "1".

       <u>selector</u> is the Gopher selector string.  In the Gopher protocol, Gopher selector strings are  a  sequence
       of  octets  which  may contain any octets except 09 hexadecimal (US-ASCII HT or tab), 0A hexadecimal (US-
       ASCII character LF), and 0D (US-ASCII character CR).

       <b>mailto</b> <b>-</b> <b>Email</b> <b>address</b>

       mailto:<u>email-address</u>

       This is an email address, usually of the form <u>name</u>@<u>hostname</u>.  See <b><a href="../man7/mailaddr.7.html">mailaddr</a></b>(7) for more information on the
       correct format of an email address.  Note that any % character must be rewritten as %25.  An  example  is
       &lt;<a href="mailto:dwheeler@dwheeler.com">mailto:dwheeler@dwheeler.com</a>&gt;.

       <b>news</b> <b>-</b> <b>Newsgroup</b> <b>or</b> <b>News</b> <b>message</b>

       news:<u>newsgroup-name</u>
       news:<u>message-id</u>

       A  <u>newsgroup-name</u>  is  a  period-delimited  hierarchical  name,  such as "comp.infosystems.www.misc".  If
       &lt;newsgroup-name&gt; is "*" (as in &lt;news:*&gt;), it is used to refer to "all available news groups".  An example
       is &lt;news:comp.lang.ada&gt;.

       A <u>message-id</u> corresponds to the Message-ID of IETF RFC 1036, without the enclosing "&lt;" and "&gt;"; it  takes
       the  form  <u>unique</u>@<u>full_domain_name</u>.   A message identifier may be distinguished from a news group name by
       the presence of the "@" character.

       <b>telnet</b> <b>-</b> <b>Telnet</b> <b>login</b>

       telnet://<u>ip_server</u>/

       The Telnet URL scheme is used to designate interactive text services that may be accessed by  the  Telnet
       protocol.   The  final  "/"  character  may  be  omitted.   The  default  port  is  23.   An  example  is
       &lt;telnet://melvyl.ucop.edu/&gt;.

       <b>file</b> <b>-</b> <b>Normal</b> <b>file</b>

       file://<u>ip_server</u>/<u>path_segments</u>
       file:<u>path_segments</u>

       This represents a file or directory accessible locally.  As a special case, <u>ip_server</u> can be  the  string
       "localhost"  or  the  empty  string;  this  is  interpreted  as  "the machine from which the URL is being
       interpreted".  If the path is to a directory, the viewer should display  the  directory's  contents  with
       links to each containee; not all viewers currently do this.  KDE supports generated files through the URL
       &lt;file:/cgi-bin&gt;.   If  the given file isn't found, browser writers may want to try to expand the filename
       via filename globbing (see <b><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></b>(7) and <b><a href="../man3/glob.3.html">glob</a></b>(3)).

       The second format (e.g., &lt;file:<a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>&gt;) is a correct format for referring to a local file.  However,
       older standards did not permit this format, and some programs don't recognize this  as  a  URI.   A  more
       portable  syntax  is  to  use an empty string as the server name, for example, &lt;file://<a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>&gt;; this
       form does the same thing and is easily recognized by pattern matchers and older programs as a URI.   Note
       that  if you really mean to say "start from the current location", don't specify the scheme at all; use a
       relative address like &lt;../test.txt&gt;, which has the side-effect of being scheme-independent.   An  example
       of this scheme is &lt;file://<a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>&gt;.

       <b>man</b> <b>-</b> <b>Man</b> <b>page</b> <b>documentation</b>

       man:<u>command-name</u>
       man:<u>command-name</u>(<u>section</u>)

       This refers to local online manual (man) reference pages.  The command name can optionally be followed by
       a  parenthesis and section number; see <b><a href="../man7/man.7.html">man</a></b>(7) for more information on the meaning of the section numbers.
       This URI scheme is unique to UNIX-like systems (such as Linux) and is not  currently  registered  by  the
       IETF.  An example is &lt;man:<a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a>(1)&gt;.

       <b>info</b> <b>-</b> <b>Info</b> <b>page</b> <b>documentation</b>

       info:<u>virtual-filename</u>
       info:<u>virtual-filename</u>#<u>nodename</u>
       info:(<u>virtual-filename</u>)
       info:(<u>virtual-filename</u>)<u>nodename</u>

       This  scheme refers to online info reference pages (generated from texinfo files), a documentation format
       used by programs such as the GNU tools.  This URI scheme is unique to UNIX-like systems (such  as  Linux)
       and  is  not  currently  registered  by  the IETF.  As of this writing, GNOME and KDE differ in their URI
       syntax and do not accept the other's syntax.  The first two formats are the GNOME  format;  in  nodenames
       all  spaces  are  written as underscores.  The second two formats are the KDE format; spaces in nodenames
       must be written as spaces, even though this is forbidden by the URI standards.  It's hoped  that  in  the
       future  most  tools will understand all of these formats and will always accept underscores for spaces in
       nodenames.  In both GNOME and KDE, if the form without the nodename is used the nodename is assumed to be
       "Top".  Examples of the GNOME format are &lt;info:gcc&gt; and  &lt;info:gcc#G++_and_GCC&gt;.   Examples  of  the  KDE
       format are &lt;info:(gcc)&gt; and &lt;info:(gcc)G++ and GCC&gt;.

       <b>whatis</b> <b>-</b> <b>Documentation</b> <b>search</b>

       whatis:<u>string</u>

       This  scheme  searches  the  database  of short (one-line) descriptions of commands and returns a list of
       descriptions containing that string.  Only complete word matches are returned.  See <b><a href="../man1/whatis.1.html">whatis</a></b>(1).  This  URI
       scheme is unique to UNIX-like systems (such as Linux) and is not currently registered by the IETF.

       <b>ghelp</b> <b>-</b> <b>GNOME</b> <b>help</b> <b>documentation</b>

       ghelp:<u>name-of-application</u>

       This  loads  GNOME  help for the given application.  Note that not much documentation currently exists in
       this format.

       <b>ldap</b> <b>-</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b>

       ldap://<u>hostport</u>
       ldap://<u>hostport</u>/
       ldap://<u>hostport</u>/<u>dn</u>
       ldap://<u>hostport</u>/<u>dn</u>?<u>attributes</u>
       ldap://<u>hostport</u>/<u>dn</u>?<u>attributes</u>?<u>scope</u>
       ldap://<u>hostport</u>/<u>dn</u>?<u>attributes</u>?<u>scope</u>?<u>filter</u>
       ldap://<u>hostport</u>/<u>dn</u>?<u>attributes</u>?<u>scope</u>?<u>filter</u>?<u>extensions</u>

       This scheme supports queries to the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), a protocol for querying
       a set of servers for hierarchically organized information (such as people and computing resources).   See
       RFC 2255 for more information on the LDAP URL scheme.  The components of this URL are:

       hostport
              the  LDAP  server  to  query,  written  as  a hostname optionally followed by a colon and the port
              number.  The default LDAP port is TCP port 389.  If empty, the client determines  which  the  LDAP
              server to use.

       dn     the  LDAP  Distinguished  Name,  which identifies the base object of the LDAP search (see RFC 2253
              section 3).

       attributes
              a comma-separated list of attributes to be returned; see RFC 2251 section 4.1.5.  If omitted,  all
              attributes should be returned.

       scope  specifies  the  scope  of the search, which can be one of "base" (for a base object search), "one"
              (for a one-level search), or "sub" (for a  subtree  search).   If  scope  is  omitted,  "base"  is
              assumed.

       filter specifies  the  search  filter  (subset  of entries to return).  If omitted, all entries should be
              returned.  See RFC 2254 section 4.

       extensions
              a comma-separated list of type=value pairs, where the =value portion may be  omitted  for  options
              not  requiring  it.  An extension prefixed with a '!' is critical (must be supported to be valid),
              otherwise it is noncritical (optional).

       LDAP queries are easiest to explain  by  example.   Here's  a  query  that  asks  ldap.itd.umich.edu  for
       information about the University of Michigan in the U.S.:

       ldap://ldap.itd.umich.edu/o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US

       To just get its postal address attribute, request:

       ldap://ldap.itd.umich.edu/o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US?postalAddress

       To  ask  a  host.com at port 6666 for information about the person with common name (cn) "Babs Jensen" at
       University of Michigan, request:

       ldap://host.com:6666/o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US??sub?(cn=Babs%20Jensen)

       <b>wais</b> <b>-</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Servers</b>

       wais://<u>hostport</u>/<u>database</u>
       wais://<u>hostport</u>/<u>database</u>?<u>search</u>
       wais://<u>hostport</u>/<u>database</u>/<u>wtype</u>/<u>wpath</u>

       This scheme designates a WAIS database, search, or document (see IETF RFC 1625 for  more  information  on
       WAIS).  Hostport is the hostname, optionally followed by a colon and port number (the default port number
       is 210).

       The  first form designates a WAIS database for searching.  The second form designates a particular search
       of the WAIS database <u>database</u>.  The third form designates a particular document within a WAIS database to
       be retrieved.  <u>wtype</u> is the WAIS designation of the type of the object and <u>wpath</u> is the WAIS document-id.

       <b>other</b> <b>schemes</b>

       There are many other URI schemes.  Most tools that accept URIs support a  set  of  internal  URIs  (e.g.,
       Mozilla  has  the  about: scheme for internal information, and the GNOME help browser has the toc: scheme
       for various starting locations).  There are many schemes that have been defined but  are  not  as  widely
       used  at the current time (e.g., prospero).  The nntp: scheme is deprecated in favor of the news: scheme.
       URNs are to be supported by the urn: scheme, with a hierarchical name  space  (e.g.,  urn:ietf:...  would
       identify  IETF  documents);  at  this  time  URNs  are not widely implemented.  Not all tools support all
       schemes.

   <b>Character</b> <b>encoding</b>
       URIs use a limited number of characters so that they can be typed in and used in a variety of situations.

       The following characters are reserved, that is, they may appear in a URI but  their  use  is  limited  to
       their reserved purpose (conflicting data must be escaped before forming the URI):

                  ; / ? : @ &amp; = + $ ,

       Unreserved  characters  may  be included in a URI.  Unreserved characters include uppercase and lowercase
       Latin letters, decimal digits, and the following limited set of punctuation marks and symbols:

                  - _ . ! ~ * ' ( )

       All other characters must be escaped.  An escaped octet is encoded as a character triplet, consisting  of
       the percent character "%" followed by the two hexadecimal digits representing the octet code (you can use
       uppercase  or  lowercase letters for the hexadecimal digits).  For example, a blank space must be escaped
       as "%20", a tab character as "%09", and the "&amp;" as "%26".  Because the percent "%" character  always  has
       the  reserved  purpose of being the escape indicator, it must be escaped as "%25".  It is common practice
       to escape space characters as the plus symbol (+) in query text; this practice isn't uniformly defined in
       the relevant RFCs (which recommend %20 instead) but any tool accepting URIs with  query  text  should  be
       prepared for them.  A URI is always shown in its "escaped" form.

       Unreserved  characters  can  be escaped without changing the semantics of the URI, but this should not be
       done unless the URI is being used in a context that does not allow the  unescaped  character  to  appear.
       For  example,  "%7e" is sometimes used instead of "~" in an HTTP URL path, but the two are equivalent for
       an HTTP URL.

       For URIs which must handle characters outside the US ASCII character set,  the  HTML  4.01  specification
       (section B.2) and IETF RFC 3986 (last paragraph of section 2.5) recommend the following approach:

       (1)  translate the character sequences into UTF-8 (IETF RFC 3629)—see <b><a href="../man7/utf-8.7.html">utf-8</a></b>(7)—and then

       (2)  use the URI escaping mechanism, that is, use the %HH encoding for unsafe octets.

   <b>Writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>URI</b>
       When  written,  URIs  should  be placed inside double quotes (e.g., "<a href="http://www.kernel.org">http://www.kernel.org</a>"), enclosed in
       angle brackets (e.g., &lt;<a href="http://lwn.net">http://lwn.net</a>&gt;), or placed on a line by themselves.  A warning for those who  use
       double-quotes:  <b>never</b> move extraneous punctuation (such as the period ending a sentence or the comma in a
       list) inside a URI, since this will change the value of the URI.  Instead, use angle brackets instead, or
       switch to a quoting system that never includes extraneous characters inside quotation marks.  This latter
       system, called the 'new' or 'logical' quoting system by "Hart's Rules" and  the  "Oxford  Dictionary  for
       Writers  and  Editors",  is preferred practice in Great Britain and in various European languages.  Older
       documents suggested inserting the prefix "URL:" just before the URI, but this form has never caught on.

       The URI syntax was designed to be unambiguous.  However, as URIs  have  become  commonplace,  traditional
       media (television, radio, newspapers, billboards, etc.) have increasingly used abbreviated URI references
       consisting   of   only   the   authority   and   path   portions   of   the  identified  resource  (e.g.,
       &lt;www.w3.org/Addressing&gt;).  Such references are primarily intended for human  interpretation  rather  than
       machine,  with  the  assumption  that  context-based heuristics are sufficient to complete the URI (e.g.,
       hostnames beginning with "www" are likely to have a URI prefix of "http://" and hostnames beginning  with
       "ftp"  likely  to  have  a  prefix of "ftp://").  Many client implementations heuristically resolve these
       references.  Such heuristics may change over time, particularly when new schemes are  introduced.   Since
       an  abbreviated URI has the same syntax as a relative URL path, abbreviated URI references cannot be used
       where relative URIs are permitted, and can be used only when there is no defined base (such as in  dialog
       boxes).   Don't  use  abbreviated  URIs  as hypertext links inside a document; use the standard format as
       described here.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       (IETF RFC 2396), (HTML 4.0).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Any tool accepting URIs (e.g., a web browser) on a Linux system should be able  to  handle  (directly  or
       indirectly)  all  of  the schemes described here, including the man: and info: schemes.  Handling them by
       invoking some other program is fine and in fact encouraged.

       Technically the fragment isn't part of the URI.

       For information on how to embed URIs (including URLs) in a data format, see documentation on that format.
       HTML uses the format &lt;A HREF="<u>uri</u>"&gt; <u>text</u> &lt;/A&gt;.  Texinfo files use the format @uref{<u>uri</u>}.   Man  and  mdoc
       have  the  recently added UR macro, or just include the URI in the text (viewers should be able to detect
       :// as part of a URI).

       The GNOME and KDE desktop environments currently vary in the URIs they accept,  in  particular  in  their
       respective  help  browsers.  To list man pages, GNOME uses &lt;toc:man&gt; while KDE uses &lt;man:(index)&gt;, and to
       list info pages, GNOME uses &lt;toc:info&gt; while KDE uses &lt;info:(dir)&gt; (the author of this man  page  prefers
       the  KDE  approach  here,  though  a  more  regular  format  would be even better).  In general, KDE uses
       &lt;file:/cgi-bin/&gt; as a prefix to a set of generated files.  KDE prefers documentation  in  HTML,  accessed
       via  the  &lt;file:/cgi-bin/helpindex&gt;.   GNOME  prefers  the  ghelp scheme to store and find documentation.
       Neither browser handles file: references to directories at the time of this writing, making it  difficult
       to  refer  to an entire directory with a browsable URI.  As noted above, these environments differ in how
       they handle the info: scheme, probably the most important variation.  It is expected that GNOME  and  KDE
       will  converge  to  common URI formats, and a future version of this man page will describe the converged
       result.  Efforts to aid this convergence are encouraged.

   <b>Security</b>
       A URI does not in itself pose a security threat.  There is no general guarantee that a URL, which at  one
       time  located  a  given resource, will continue to do so.  Nor is there any guarantee that a URL will not
       locate a different resource at some later point in time; such a guarantee can be obtained only  from  the
       person(s) controlling that namespace and the resource in question.

       It  is  sometimes  possible  to  construct  a  URL  such  that an attempt to perform a seemingly harmless
       operation, such as the retrieval of an entity associated with the resource, will in fact cause a possibly
       damaging remote operation to occur.  The unsafe URL is typically constructed by specifying a port  number
       other  than  that  reserved for the network protocol in question.  The client unwittingly contacts a site
       that is in fact running a different protocol.  The content of the URL contains  instructions  that,  when
       interpreted according to this other protocol, cause an unexpected operation.  An example has been the use
       of a gopher URL to cause an unintended or impersonating message to be sent via a SMTP server.

       Caution  should  be  used  when using any URL that specifies a port number other than the default for the
       protocol, especially when it is a number within the reserved space.

       Care should be taken when a URI contains escaped delimiters for a given protocol (for example, CR and  LF
       characters  for  telnet  protocols) that these are not unescaped before transmission.  This might violate
       the protocol, but avoids the potential for such characters to be used to simulate an extra  operation  or
       parameter in that protocol, which might lead to an unexpected and possibly harmful remote operation to be
       performed.

       It  is  clearly  unwise  to  use  a  URI  that  contains  a  password which is intended to be secret.  In
       particular, the use of a password within the "userinfo"  component  of  a  URI  is  strongly  recommended
       against except in those rare cases where the "password" parameter is intended to be public.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Documentation  may  be  placed  in a variety of locations, so there currently isn't a good URI scheme for
       general online documentation in arbitrary formats.  References of the  form  &lt;file:///usr/doc/ZZZ&gt;  don't
       work because different distributions and local installation requirements may place the files in different
       directories  (it  may  be  in  /usr/doc, or /usr/local/doc, or <a href="file:/usr/share">/usr/share</a>, or somewhere else).  Also, the
       directory ZZZ usually changes when a version changes (though filename globbing could  partially  overcome
       this).   Finally, using the file: scheme doesn't easily support people who dynamically load documentation
       from the Internet (instead of loading the files onto a local filesystem).  A future  URI  scheme  may  be
       added  (e.g.,  "userdoc:")  to permit programs to include cross-references to more detailed documentation
       without having to know the exact location of that documentation.  Alternatively, a future version of  the
       filesystem specification may specify file locations sufficiently so that the file: scheme will be able to
       locate documentation.

       Many programs and file formats don't include a way to incorporate or implement links using URIs.

       Many  programs  can't  handle all of these different URI formats; there should be a standard mechanism to
       load an arbitrary URI that automatically detects the users' environment (e.g., text or graphics,  desktop
       environment,  local  user  preferences, and currently executing tools) and invokes the right tool for any
       URI.
