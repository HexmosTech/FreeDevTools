       passphrase-encoding - How diverse parts of OpenSSL treat pass phrases character encoding

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In a modern world with all sorts of character encodings, the treatment of pass phrases has become
       increasingly complex.  This manual page attempts to give an overview over how this problem is currently
       addressed in different parts of the OpenSSL library.

   <b>The</b> <b>general</b> <b>case</b>
       The OpenSSL library doesn't treat pass phrases in any special way as a general rule, and trusts the
       application or user to choose a suitable character set and stick to that throughout the lifetime of
       affected objects.  This means that for an object that was encrypted using a pass phrase encoded in
       ISO-8859-1, that object needs to be decrypted using a pass phrase encoded in ISO-8859-1.  Using the wrong
       encoding is expected to cause a decryption failure.

   <b>PKCS#12</b>
       PKCS#12 is a bit different regarding pass phrase encoding.  The standard stipulates that the pass phrase
       shall be encoded as an ASN.1 BMPString, which consists of the code points of the basic multilingual
       plane, encoded in big endian (UCS-2 BE).

       OpenSSL tries to adapt to this requirements in one of the following manners:

       1.  Treats  the  received  pass phrase as UTF-8 encoded and tries to re-encode it to UTF-16 (which is the
           same as UCS-2 for characters U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+FFFF, but becomes an expansion for  any
           other character), or failing that, proceeds with step 2.

       2.  Assumes  that  the  pass phrase is encoded in ASCII or ISO-8859-1 and opportunistically prepends each
           byte with a zero byte to obtain the UCS-2 encoding of the characters, which it stores as a BMPString.

           Note that since there is no check of your locale, this may produce UCS-2 / UTF-16 characters that  do
           not  correspond  to  the  original  pass  phrase  characters  for  other  character sets, such as any
           ISO-8859-X encoding other than ISO-8859-1 (or for Windows, CP  1252  with  exception  for  the  extra
           "graphical" characters in the 0x80-0x9F range).

       OpenSSL  versions older than 1.1.0 do variant 2 only, and that is the reason why OpenSSL still does this,
       to be able to read files produced with older versions.

       It should be noted that this approach isn't entirely fault free.

       A pass phrase encoded in ISO-8859-2 could very well have a sequence such as 0xC3 0xAF (which is  the  two
       characters  "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH BREVE" and "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z WITH DOT ABOVE" in ISO-8859-2
       encoding), but would be misinterpreted as the perfectly valid UTF-8  encoded  code  point  U+00EF  (LATIN
       SMALL  LETTER  I WITH DIAERESIS) <u>if</u> <u>the</u> <u>pass</u> <u>phrase</u> <u>doesn't</u> <u>contain</u> <u>anything</u> <u>that</u> <u>would</u> <u>be</u> <u>invalid</u> <u>UTF-8</u>.
       A pass phrase that contains this kind of byte sequence will give a different outcome in OpenSSL 1.1.0 and
       newer than in OpenSSL older than 1.1.0.

        0x00 0xC3 0x00 0xAF                    # OpenSSL older than 1.1.0
        0x00 0xEF                              # OpenSSL 1.1.0 and newer

       On the same accord,  anything  encoded  in  UTF-8  that  was  given  to  OpenSSL  older  than  1.1.0  was
       misinterpreted as ISO-8859-1 sequences.

   <b>OSSL_STORE</b>
       <b><a href="../man7/ossl_store.7.html">ossl_store</a></b>(7)  acts  as  a general interface to access all kinds of objects, potentially protected with a
       pass phrase, a PIN or something else.  This API stipulates that pass phrases should be UTF-8 encoded, and
       that any other pass phrase encoding may give undefined results.  This API relies on  the  application  to
       ensure UTF-8 encoding, and doesn't check that this is the case, so what it gets, it will also pass to the
       underlying loader.

</pre><h4><b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  assumes  that you know what pass phrase was used for encryption, but that it may have been
       encoded in a different character encoding than the one used by your current input method.   For  example,
       the  pass  phrase  may  have  been used at a time when your default encoding was ISO-8859-1 (i.e. "naïve"
       resulting in the byte sequence 0x6E 0x61 0xEF 0x76 0x65), and you're now in  an  environment  where  your
       default  encoding  is  UTF-8 (i.e. "naïve" resulting in the byte sequence 0x6E 0x61 0xC3 0xAF 0x76 0x65).
       Whenever it's mentioned that you should use a certain character encoding, it should  be  understood  that
       you  either  change  the input method to use the mentioned encoding when you type in your pass phrase, or
       use some suitable tool to convert your pass phrase from your default encoding to the target encoding.

       Also note that the sub-sections below discuss human readable pass phrases.  This is particularly relevant
       for PKCS#12 objects, where human  readable  pass  phrases  are  assumed.   For  other  objects,  it's  as
       legitimate  to  use  any  byte  sequence (such as a sequence of bytes from <u>/dev/urandom</u> that's been saved
       away), which makes any character encoding discussion irrelevant; in such cases, simply use the same  byte
       sequence as it is.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>new</b> <b>objects</b>
       For  creating  new pass phrase protected objects, make sure the pass phrase is encoded using UTF-8.  This
       is default on most modern Unixes, but may  involve  an  effort  on  other  platforms.   Specifically  for
       Windows,  setting  the  environment  variable  <b>OPENSSL_WIN32_UTF8</b> will have anything entered on [Windows]
       console prompt converted to UTF-8 (command line and separately prompted pass phrases alike).

   <b>Opening</b> <b>existing</b> <b>objects</b>
       For opening pass phrase protected objects where you  know  what  character  encoding  was  used  for  the
       encryption pass phrase, make sure to use the same encoding again.

       For opening pass phrase protected objects where the character encoding that was used is unknown, or where
       the producing application is unknown, try one of the following:

       1.  Try  the  pass  phrase  that  you  have as it is in the character encoding of your environment.  It's
           possible that its byte sequence is exactly right.

       2.  Convert the pass phrase to UTF-8 and try with the result.  Specifically  with  PKCS#12,  this  should
           open up any object that was created according to the specification.

       3.  Do  a  naïve (i.e. purely mathematical) ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8 conversion and try with the result.  This
           differs from the previous attempt because ISO-8859-1 maps directly to U+0000 to U+00FF,  which  other
           non-UTF-8 character sets do not.

           This  also takes care of the case when a UTF-8 encoded string was used with OpenSSL older than 1.1.0.
           (for example, "ï", which is 0xC3 0xAF when encoded in UTF-8, would become 0xC3 0x83  0xC2  0xAF  when
           re-encoded  in  the  naïve  manner.  The conversion to BMPString would then yield 0x00 0xC3 0x00 0xA4
           0x00 0x00, the erroneous/non-compliant encoding used by OpenSSL older than 1.1.0)
