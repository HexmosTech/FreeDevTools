       nng_push - push protocol

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           #include &lt;nng/protocol/pipeline0/push.h&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>push</u> protocol is one half of a pipeline pattern. The other side is the <u>pull</u> protocol.

       In the pipeline pattern, pushers distribute messages to pullers. Each message sent by a pusher will be
       sent to one of its peer pullers, chosen in a round-robin fashion from the set of connected peers
       available for receiving. This property makes this pattern useful in load-balancing scenarios.

   <b>Socket</b> <b>Operations</b>
       The nng_push0_open() call creates a pusher socket. This socket may be used to send messages, but is
       unable to receive them. Attempts to receive messages will result in NNG_ENOTSUP.

       Send operations will observe flow control (back-pressure), so that only peers capable of accepting a
       message will be considered. If no peer is available to receive a message, then the send operation will
       wait until one is available, or the operation times out.

           <b>Note</b>

           Although the pipeline protocol honors flow control, and attempts to avoid dropping messages, no
           guarantee of delivery is made. Furthermore, as there is no capability for message acknowledgment,
           applications that need reliable delivery are encouraged to consider the <u>req</u> protocol instead.

   <b>Protocol</b> <b>Versions</b>
       Only version 0 of this protocol is supported. (At the time of writing, no other versions of this protocol
       have been defined.)

   <b>Protocol</b> <b>Options</b>
       NNG_OPT_SENDBUF
           (int, 0 - 8192) Normally this is set to zero, indicating that send operations are unbuffered. In
           unbuffered operation, send operations will wait until a suitable peer is available to receive the
           message. If this is set to a positive value (up to 8192), then an intermediate buffer is provided for
           the socket with the specified depth (in messages).

           <b>Note</b>

           Transport layer buffering may occur in addition to any socket buffer determined by this option.

   <b>Protocol</b> <b>Headers</b>
       The <u>push</u> protocol has no protocol-specific headers.
