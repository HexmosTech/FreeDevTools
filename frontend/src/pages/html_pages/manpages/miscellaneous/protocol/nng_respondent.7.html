       nng_respondent - respondent protocol

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           #include &lt;nng/protocol/survey0/respond.h&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>respondent</u> protocol is one half of a survey pattern. In this pattern, a surveyor sends a survey,
       which is broadcast to all peer respondents. The respondents then have a chance to reply (but are not
       obliged to reply). The survey itself is a timed event, so that responses received after the survey has
       finished are discarded.

           <b>Tip</b>

           This protocol is useful in solving voting problems, such as leader election in cluster
           configurations, as well as certain kinds of service discovery problems.

       The <u>respondent</u> protocol is the respondent side, and the <u>surveyor</u> protocol is the surveyor side.

   <b>Socket</b> <b>Operations</b>
       The nng_respondent0_open() functions create a respondent socket. This socket may be used to receive
       messages, and then to send replies. A reply can only be sent after receiving a survey, and generally the
       reply will be sent to surveyor from whom the last survey was received.

       Respondents may discard a survey by simply not replying to it.

       Raw mode sockets (set with NNG_OPT_RAW) ignore all these restrictions.

   <b>Context</b> <b>Operations</b>
       This protocol supports the creation of contexts for concurrent use cases using nng_ctx_open().

       Incoming surveys will be routed to and received by only one context. Additional surveys may be received
       by other contexts in parallel. Replies made using a context will be returned to the the surveyor that
       issued the survey most recently received by that context. The restrictions for order of operations with
       sockets apply equally well for contexts, except that each context will be treated as if it were a
       separate socket.

   <b>Protocol</b> <b>Versions</b>
       Only version 0 of this protocol is supported. (At the time of writing, no other versions of this protocol
       have been defined. An earlier and incompatible version of the protocol was used in older pre-releases of
       nanomsg &lt;<a href="http://nanomsg.org">http://nanomsg.org</a>&gt;, but was not released in any production version.)

   <b>Protocol</b> <b>Options</b>
       The <u>respondent</u> protocol has no protocol-specific options.

   <b>Protocol</b> <b>Headers</b>
       The <u>respondent</u> protocol uses a <u>backtrace</u> in the header. This is more fully documented in the <u>surveyor</u>
       manual.
