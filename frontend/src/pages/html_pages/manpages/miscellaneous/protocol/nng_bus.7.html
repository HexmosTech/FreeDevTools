       nng_bus - bus protocol

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           #include &lt;nng/protocol/bus0/bus.h&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>bus</u> protocol provides for building mesh networks where every peer is connected to every other peer.
       In this protocol, each message sent by a node is sent to every one of its directly connected peers.

           <b>Tip</b>

           Messages are only sent to directly connected peers. This means that in the event that a peer is
           connected indirectly, it will not receive messages. When using this protocol to build mesh networks,
           it is therefore important that a <u>fully-connected</u> mesh network be constructed.

       All message delivery in this pattern is best-effort, which means that peers may not receive messages.
       Furthermore, delivery may occur to some, all, or none of the directly connected peers. (Messages are not
       delivered when peer nodes are unable to receive.) Hence, send operations will never block; instead if the
       message cannot be delivered for any reason it is discarded.

           <b>Tip</b>

           In order to minimize the likelihood of message loss, this protocol should not be used for high
           throughput communications. Furthermore, the more traffic <u>in</u> <u>aggregate</u> that occurs across the
           topology, the more likely that message loss is to occur.

   <b>Socket</b> <b>Operations</b>
       The nng_bus0_open() functions create a bus socket. This socket may be used to send and receive messages.
       Sending messages will attempt to deliver to each directly connected peer.

   <b>Protocol</b> <b>Versions</b>
       Only version 0 of this protocol is supported. (At the time of writing, no other versions of this protocol
       have been defined.)

   <b>Protocol</b> <b>Options</b>
       The <u>bus</u> protocol has no protocol-specific options.

   <b>Protocol</b> <b>Headers</b>
       When using a <u>bus</u> socket in raw mode, received messages will contain the incoming pipe ID as the sole
       element in the header. If a message containing such a header is sent using a raw <u>bus</u> socket, then, the
       message will be delivered to all connected pipes <u>except</u> the one identified in the header. This behavior
       is intended for use with device configurations consisting of just a single socket. Such configurations
       are useful in the creation of rebroadcasters, and this capability prevents a message from being routed
       back to its source. If no header is present, then a message is sent to all connected pipes.

       When using normal (cooked mode) <u>bus</u> sockets, no message headers are present.
