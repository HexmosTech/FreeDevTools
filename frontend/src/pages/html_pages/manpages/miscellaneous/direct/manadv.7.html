       manadv - Direct verbs for mana devices

       This  provides  low  level access to mana devices to perform direct operations, without general branching
       performed by libibverbs.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  libibverbs  API  is  an  abstract  one.   It  is  agnostic  to  any  underlying  provider   specific
       implementation.   While  this  abstraction  has  the advantage of user applications portability, it has a
       performance penalty.  For some applications optimizing performance is more important than portability.

       The mana direct verbs API is intended  for  such  applications.   It  exposes  mana  specific  low  level
       operations, allowing the application to bypass the libibverbs API.

       This  version  of  the  driver  supports  one  QP  type:  IBV_QPT_RAW_PACKET.   To  use this QP type, the
       application is required to use manadv_set_context_attr() to set external buffer allocators for allocating
       queues, and use manadv_init_obj() to obtain all the queue information.  The  application  implements  its
       own  queue  operations,  bypassing  libibverbs  API  for  sending/receiving  traffic over the queues.  At
       hardware layer, IBV_QPT_RAW_PACKET QP shares the same hardware resource as the Ethernet port used in  the
       kernel.   The  software  checks  for  exclusive  use  of the hardware Ethernet port, and will fail the QP
       creation if the port is already in use.  To create a IBV_QPT_RAW_PACKET on a  specified  port,  the  user
       needs  to  configure the system in such a way that this port is not used by any other software (including
       the Kernel).  If the port is used, ibv_create_qp() will fail with errno set to EBUSY.

       The direct include of manadv.h together with linkage to  mana  library  will  allow  usage  of  this  new
       interface.
