       std-us-notes - afnix installation guide

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b> <b>GUIDE</b></h4><pre>
       This  chapter  describes  the  installation  procedures for the  AFNIX  writing system distribution. This
       chapter explains how to set and compile this distribution.

       <b>Software</b> <b>distribution</b>
       The complete distribution can be downloaded from the AFNIX home page. The result  is  a  complete  source
       tree that is ready for compilation. The distribution contains also the documentation as well as examples.
       The  distribution is supported on a variety of platforms as indicated below that can be either 32 bits or
       64 bits machines. The distribution is also available at the FreeBSD port collection.
       Platform   Processor        Operating system
       Linux      X86-32, X86-64   Linux 3.x, 4.x, 5.x
       FreeBSD    X86-32, X86-64   FreeBSD 8.x, 9.x, 10.x.x, 11.x.x, 12.x.x
       Gnu        X86-32, X86-64   GNU KBSD, GNU Hurd

       Specific processors like the Alpha, M68K, ARM, MIPS, RISCV and  SUPERH  are  also  supported  on  certain
       distributions.  The  PowerPC  (PPC)  processor has been discontinued. The Solaris SPARC platform has been
       discontinued. Do not hesitate to contact the development team for specific processor or platform support.

       <b>Installation</b> <b>procedure</b>
       The core software is written in C++. It has been successfully built with the latest GNU GCC 10. The clang
       compiler has also been  succesfully  tested.  You  will  also  need  the  GNU  Make  package.  With  some
       distributions the command is called gmake. Note that the Makefile hierarchy is designed to operate safely
       with the -jGNU Make option.

       <u>Unpacking</u> <u>the</u> <u>distribution</u>
       The  distribution  is available as a compressed tar file. Note that the documentation is distributed in a
       separate file. The following command unpacks the distribution.

       zsh&gt; gzip -d afnix-src-[version].tar.gz
       zsh&gt; tar  xf afnix-src-[version].tar

       <u>Quick</u> <u>command</u> <u>reference</u>
       The list of commands to execute is given in the example below. A detailed description for each command is
       given hereafter. The make world command is the default command  that  builds  the  whole  tree  with  the
       default compiler.

       zsh&gt; ./cnf/bin/afnix-setup -o --prefix=/usr/local/afnix
       zsh&gt; make status
       zsh&gt; make [-j]
       zsh&gt; make test
       zsh&gt; make install
       zsh&gt; make clean

       With some platforms, the make command should be replaced by the gmake command. The make status command is
       optional  and  can  be  used  to  report  the internal value contents. In particular, the version and the
       installation parameters are reported.

       <u>Configuration</u>
       The afnix-setup command can be invoked to setup a particular configuration. You should have your compiler
       on your search path. Normally, the command given below is enough.

       zsh&gt; ./cnf/bin/afnix-setup -o --prefix=/usr/local/afnix

       This command checks that the target platform can be detected and configured. The -o option configures the
       compilation in optimized mode. Use the -g option can be used to configure  the  build  process  in  debug
       mode.  The  --prefix option sets the installation directory. Note that the compilation process is done in
       the distribution tree and that the --prefix option affects  only  the  installation  operations.  The  -v
       option is the verbose option. Other options are available for fine tuning.
       Option     Description                              Default
       -h         Print a help message                     n/a
       -v         Set the verbose mode                     n/a
       -g         Set the debug mode                       yes
       -o         Set the optimized mode                   no
       --help     Same as -h                               n/a
       --prefix   Set the target install directory         <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>
       --shrdir   Set the shared install directory         <a href="file:/usr/local/share">/usr/local/share</a>
       --altdir   Set the alternate install directory      <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>
       --sdknam   Set the target sdk by name               platform dependent
       --sdkdir   Set the target sdk directory             platform dependent
       --ccname   Set the default compiler                 platform dependent
       --shared   Compile and link dynamically             yes
       --static   Compile and link statically              no
       --openmp   Enable the optional openmp compilation   no

       The  prefix  option  set the root installation directory. The binary and library installation directories
       are derived from it. The shrdir set the shared installation directory which  is  normally  used  for  the
       installation  of  the  manual  pages  on most popular systems. the altdir sets the alternate installation
       directory. Normally this path should be empty as it affects the path for the  etc  directory.  This  flag
       should  be  used  when  using  a  prefix to unusual destination. The ccname option can be used to force a
       particular compiler with the help of a compiler configuration file. The -s or --static option can be used
       to build a static executable. Normally, this option should not be used  since  it  restrict  the  use  of
       extension  modules. The shared controls whether or not the dynamic libraries should be built. This option
       is detected automatically for a particular platform and should be used only by package maintainer.  There
       exists  also  specific  options which are mostly for package maintainers. At this time, the build process
       integrates the Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora specific packaging mechanism.
       Option     Description                              Default
       --pkgnam   Set the distribution package             none
       --pkgbin   Set the optional package bin directory   none
       --pkglib   Set the optional package lib directory   none
       --pkgprj   Set the optional package prj directory   none
       --pkghdr   Set the optional package hdr directory   none
       --pkgetc   Set the optional package etc directory   none
       --pkgman   Set the optional package man directory   none
       --pkgdoc   Set the optional package doc directory   none
       --pkgwww   Set the optional package www directory   none
       --pkgsrv   Set the optional package srv directory   none

       <u>Compiling</u> <u>the</u> <u>distribution</u>
       The compilation process is straightforward. With some platforms, the make accepts  the  -j  that  enables
       concurrent operations.

       zsh&gt; make [-j]

       This  will  build  the  complete distribution locally. If an error occurs, it is best to report it at the
       (<a href="mailto:bugs@afnix.org">bugs@afnix.org</a>) AFNIX bug report mail address.

       <u>Testing</u> <u>the</u> <u>distribution</u>
       The distribution contains all test suites. The test suites are compiled and executed with  the  following
       command.

       zsh&gt; make test

       This command run the test suites for each library as well as the test suites for each application client.
       Most  of  the base library test suites are written in C++ with the application test suites written in the
       core writing system.

       <u>Installing</u> <u>the</u> <u>distribution</u>
       Once the system has been built and tested, it can be installed. By  default,  the  distribution  tree  is
       installed  into  the  <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>  directory.  This can be overwritten with the --prefix option during the
       configuration process.

       zsh&gt; make install

       There are several variables that controls the behavior of the install rule. Each variable has its default
       value sets during the setup configuration.  However,  this  variable  can  also  be  altered  during  the
       installation process
       Variable   Description                          Default
       PREFIX     The root install directory           <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>
       SHRDIR     The shared install directory         <a href="file:/usr/local/share">/usr/local/share</a>
       ALTDIR     The shared alternate directory       <a href="file:/usr/local/etc">/usr/local/etc</a>
       SDKDIR     The system  kit directory            platform dependent
       BINDIR     The binary install directory         prefix/bin
       LIBDIR     The library install directory        prefix/lib
       HDRDIR     The header files install directory   prefix/include/afnix
       ETCDIR     The extra files install directory    altdir/etc/afnix

       <u>Installing</u> <u>the</u> <u>documentation</u>
       The  documentation  is installed independently of the software. The doc rule builds the documentation and
       the  publish  rule  installs  the  documentation.  Several  variables  also  control  the   documentation
       installation path.
       Variable   Description                           Default
       DOCDIR     The documentation install directory   shrdir/doc/afnix
       MANDIR     The manual pages install directory    shrdir/man

       <u>Cleaning</u> <u>the</u> <u>distribution</u>
       The distribution is cleaned with the clean rule.

       zsh&gt; make clean

       This rule does not clean the configuration. For a complete cleaning the reset rule is more appropriate.

       zsh&gt; make reset

       <b>Running</b> <b>AFNIX</b>
       The  axi  command  invokes the interpreter. In order to operate properly, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
       variable must be configured with the directory containing the shared libraries.  If  the  libraries  have
       been installed in a standard location like <a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a>, there is nothing to do.

       <u>Running</u> <u>some</u> <u>examples</u>
       The  directory exp contains various examples which can be run. Each example is labeled according to their
       use in the volume 1 of the documentation set. Example 0101.als prints the message  hello  world.  Example
       0501.als prints various information about the system configuration.

       zsh&gt; axi EXP0501
       major version number   : 3
       minor version number   : 8
       patch version number   : 0
       interpreter version    : 3.8.0
       program name           : axi
       operating system name  : linux
       operating system type  : unix
       machine size           : 64
       afnix official uri     : <a href="http://www.afnix.org">http://www.afnix.org</a>

       <b>Special</b> <b>features</b>
       The  build process provides several features that permits to customize the compilation process as well as
       the nature of the final executable. Most of  the  time,  these  options  are  reserved  for  the  package
       maintainer and are given below for illustration purpose.

       <u>Special</u> <u>target</u> <u>extensions</u>
       Extensions  are  specific  libraries  or  executables  which are not build automatically during the build
       process. The user is responsible to decide which extension is needed for the system  All  extensions  are
       located  under  the  src/ext  directory. Simply going into the appropriate directory and running the make
       command will build the extension.  The asi extension creates a  static  interpreter  with  all  libraries
       automatically included in the final executable. The extension is simply build with the following command.
       Note that this extension overwrite the previous executable in the bld/bin directory.

       zsh&gt; make -C src/ext/asi

       <u>Extra</u> <u>files</u>
       The  distribution  comes  with  some  extra  files.  The most important is the Emacs mode afnix-mode. The
       original source file is written in Emacs Lisp and is available in the etc directory of the  distribution.
       This file should be installed according to the current Emacs installation.

</pre><h4><b>MAINTAINER</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This  chapter  contains additional notes for the package maintainer. They are also useful for anybody who
       is in charge of integrating the distribution in a build process. The chapter describes  the  distribution
       tree with more details.

       <b>The</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>tree</b>
       The distribution tree is composed of various directories. Each of them has a Makefile which can be called
       locally or from the top level.

              <b>cnf</b>
              This  directory contains the configuration distribution and various utilities. Normally you should
              not touch it, unless you are using a compiler different than gcc.

              <b>src</b>
              This directory contains the complete source tree. The source code is written in C++. Normally this
              directory is left untouched.  If  there  are  good  reasons  to  modify  it,  please  contact  the
              development team.

              <b>tst</b>
              This  directory  contains  the  complete test suites. The test suites are used by various programs
              including the main interpreter, the compiler and the debugger. It shall be noted that the  library
              distribution also includes specific test suites.

              <b>doc</b>
              This directory contains the complete documentation written in in XML with a special DTD. It should
              be left untouched.

              <b>etc</b>
              This  directory  contains various files associated with the distribution. Some files are useful to
              be copied.

              <b>exp</b>
              This directory contains various examples. They are included for illustration purpose.

       The process of building a package solely depends on the distribution  type.  Most  likely,  the  standard
       distribution  should  contain  the  binary  executables as well as some configuration file and the manual
       pages. The documentation and the development header files can put in separate packages.

       <b>Configuration</b> <b>and</b> <b>setup</b>
       The configuration process involves the use of the afnix-setup command located in the  cnf/bin  directory.
       This  command  is  used  to configure the distribution. Package maintainers are encouraged to use it with
       specific options.

       <u>Platform</u> <u>detection</u>
       The afnix-guess command is used during the configuration process to detect  a  supported  platform.  This
       command  can  be  run  in  stand-alone  mode. Various options can be used to tune the type of information
       requested.
       Option   Description
       -h       Print a help message
       -n       Print the platform name
       -v       Print the platform version
       -M       Print the platform major number
       -m       Print the platform minor number
       -p       Print the processor name

       Without option, the utility prints a platform and processor description string.

       zsh&gt; ./cnf/bin/afnix-guess
       linux-5.4-x64

       <u>Platform</u> <u>defaults</u>
       The directory cnf/def contains a platform specific default file. The file determines what is the  default
       compiler  and  linking  mode.  This  file  is  used  by  the afnix-setup command. For example, the afnix-
       darwin.def file contains:

       compiler: gcc
       lktype  : dynamic
       lkmode  : dylib

       Such options instructs the configuration utility, that the default compiler is gcc and the  linking  mode
       should operates in dynamic mode by using the dylib rule. These default values can be overwritten with the
       equivalent option of the afnix-setup command. Note that the compiler version is automatically detected by
       the  system.  The  afnix-vcomp command will return the appropriate compiler version running on the target
       system.

       <u>C++</u> <u>source</u> <u>file</u> <u>conventions</u>
       THe source tree has two types of C++ files. The first type has the extension .cxx and the second type has
       the extension .cpp. The .cxx -- and the associated .hxx -- files are  only  used  to  indicate  a  system
       dependency.  These  files  are found only in the src/lib/plt directory. The .cxx extension indicates that
       the file might use system specific include files. The .cpp -- and the associated .hpp --  files  are  the
       normal  C++  source  files. The .cpp extension is used to indicate that these files will not use a system
       specific file. By default this rule is enforced in the compiler configuration  file  by  specifying  some
       compiler flags which do not authorize such access.

       <u>Configuration</u> <u>files</u>
       The  configurations  files  are located in the cnf/mak directory. Normally they should be left untouched.
       The most important one is the afnix-rule.mak file that defines most of the compilation and linking rules.
       Additionally, during the setup operation, the afnix-setup command creates several files  in  the  bld/cnf
       directory. The bld is the build directory. The afnix-plat.mak file is the platform configuration file and
       the afnix-comp.mak is a link to the appropriate compiler configuration file.

       <b>Compilation</b>
       Normally,  the compilation process is immediate. Just invoking the make command will do the job. However,
       some package maintainer have the desire to overwrite some flags. Some options are provided to  facilitate
       this task.

              <b>EXTCPPFLAGS</b>
              This flag can be used to add some compilation flags for all .cpp files.

              <b>EXTCXXFLAGS</b>
              This flag can be used to add some compilation flags for all .cxx files.

              <b>EXTCCDEFINE</b>
              This flag can be used to add some compilation definitions for all source files.

              <b>EXTINCLUDES</b>
              This flag can be used to add some compilation paths for the .cxx files.

       For example, it is common to have some maintainer to compile with both the debug and optimize flags. This
       can be done with the following command (assuming an optimized configuration):

       make EXTCPPFLAGS=-g EXTCXXFLAGS=-g

       All  include  files,  compiled  libraries and executables are placed in the bld directory. This directory
       contains the bld/bin for binaries, bld/lib for libraries and bld/hdr for the header files.

       <b>Building</b> <b>the</b> <b>package</b>
       The package can be built by accessing the bld directory or by  invoking  the  install  rule.  The  second
       method is not recommended for package construction, since it might trigger some file installation without
       any  control.   The  etc/unx  directory  contains  some  special files that might be used for the package
       construction. A sample list of them is given hereafter.

              <b>afnix-mode.el</b>
              This file is the Emacs mode.

              <b>afnix-gud.el</b>
              This file is the debugger Emacs gud mode.

       <b>Specific</b> <b>makefile</b> <b>rules</b>
       The top level Makefile contains several rules that might be useful for the package maintainer.

              <b>status</b>
              This rule show the configuration status for each parameters with the version.

              <b>debug</b>
              This rule invokes the default configuration in debug mode.

              <b>optimized</b>
              This rule invokes the default configuration in optimized mode.

              <b>build</b>
              This rule invokes the default configuration in debug mode and compile the whole distribution.  The
              default install directory is /usr/local.

              <b>world</b>
              This  rule invokes the default configuration in optimized mode and compile the whole distribution.
              The default install directory is /usr/local.

              <b>test</b>
              This rule runs all test suites.

              <b>doc</b>
              This rule builds the documentation.

              <b>distri</b>
              This rule builds the distribution.

              <b>install</b>
              This rule installs the distribution.

              <b>publish</b>
              This rule installs the documentation.

              <b>clean</b>
              This rule cleans the distribution but keep the configuration.

              <b>reset</b>
              This rule resets the distribution including the configuration.

</pre><h4><b>RELEASE</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This chapter contains the release notes for the different releases. Release notes are given in descending
       order for a particular version. The standard notation is major.minor.patch which represents respectively,
       the major, minor and patch number. A major version number changes indicates a substantial change  in  the
       distribution,  including  new  tools,  application  interface  and license. A minor version number change
       indicates noticeable change, with or without new tools  but  without  application  interface  change  nor
       license  change.  Finally,  a  patch  number change indicates a simple change to fix problem. There is no
       additional features in a patch nor an application interface change.

       <b>Release</b> <b>3.8</b>

              <b>Core</b> <b>engine:</b> <b>release</b> <b>3.8.0</b>
              This is a medium release in line with the previous  release  which  integrates  some  funcdamental
              restructuring  of the core interpreter in preparation for distributed execution. The module object
              has been refactored as well as the debugger.

              <b>Core</b> <b>engine:</b> <b>hyper</b> <b>threaded</b> <b>interpreter</b>

              <b>Core</b> <b>engine:</b> <b>class</b> <b>defer</b> <b>support</b>
              The concept of class defer object has been added to the  Class  object.  The  defer  mode  is  the
              opposite of the infer mode and provides a mechanism for base class creation.

              <b>Core</b> <b>engine:</b> <b>print</b> <b>table</b> <b>header</b>
              The PrintTable object has been enhanced to support the concept of table header.

              <b>Core</b> <b>engine:</b> <b>exception</b> <b>re-throwing</b>
              The exception object what can be thrown with the reserved keyword throw. This provides a mechanism
              to re-throw an exception.

              <b>Core</b> <b>engine:</b> <b>critical</b> <b>bug</b> <b>with</b> <b>return</b> <b>form</b>
              A  critical  bug in the core engine affecting the behavior of the return reserved keyword in a try
              block has been fixed. A return form inside a try block was  incorrectly  generating  an  exception
              which was subsequently caught by the try block.

              <b>Core</b> <b>modules:</b> <b>net</b> <b>module</b>
              The  base  network  module has been enhanced to better operate with IPV6. In particular, when both
              IPV4 and IPV6 stacks are present and a host name (typically localhost) have an address entry,  the
              socket constructor make sure it can build an object. The IPV6 address display has been rewritten.

              <b>Core</b> <b>modules:</b> <b>sio</b> <b>module</b>
              A  new  object  called  Pathname  has  been  added  to support the manipulation of system path. In
              addition, two new functions mkdir and  mhdir  have  been  also  added  to  support  the  directory
              creation, both normally and hierarchically.

              The  Uri  has  been  dramatically  enhanced  to  conform  to the RFC 3986. In particular, the path
              representation for urn is now working properly. The cookie object has been massaged to support the
              cookie version 1, although it does not seem to be supported (yet!) by the browsers.

              <b>Core</b> <b>modules:</b> <b>xml</b> <b>module</b>
              The xml module has been enhanced with a new parsing system called the simple model. In the  simple
              model, nodes are parsed in a linear fashion. The node content is available in the form of a string
              and its interpretation is at the user discretion.

              <b>Core</b> <b>service:</b> <b>wax</b> <b>service</b>
              The  afnix-wam  service  has been renamed as afnix-wax. The service has also been updated with two
              new objects, namely the XmlMime and XhtmlMime which permits to build a mime representation  of  an
              xml  tree. Several xhtml objects have also been added to complete the collection. This include the
              XhtmlScript for example.

              <b>Core</b> <b>service:</b> <b>xpe</b> <b>service</b>
              The afnix-xpe service has been added as a  new  service.  The  xml  processing  environment  (xpe)
              provides  a  xml processor that permits manipulate the whole xml tree with the help of various xml
              processor features. In particular, the service provides the support for the xml include extension.

              <b>Core</b> <b>projects:</b> <b>apx</b> <b>project</b>
              This release incorporates for the first time, the concept of  core  project,  which  represents  a
              librarian  or  an application. The first project is the AFNIX protocol extension or apx which is a
              message based protocol  designed  to  transport  request/reply  messages  within  a  client/server
              environment.  The  message  is  built  with  the  xml  library  and  the  librarian  provides  the
              encapsulation layer.

              The core engine has been substantially changed to support the new Unicode 5.0 standard. As of now,
              the  engine  is  in  place  internally,  but  not  fully  activated.  In  particular,  the  string
              normalization is implemented but not activated. The  next  release  should  incorporate  the  full
              system with a change that should be transparent to the user.

              <b>Core</b> <b>language:</b> <b>instance</b> <b>inference</b>
              An  instance  inference  mechanism -- which is equivalent to the concept of virtual constructor --
              has been added to the core engine. Such system permits to derive top instance from a base instance
              construction.

              <b>Core</b> <b>language:</b> <b>print</b> <b>table</b> <b>object</b>
              The PrintTable object has been enhanced with a dump method similar to the format method.

              expected in the next release.

              <b>Core</b> <b>modules:</b> <b>nwg</b> <b>module</b>
              A new module called afnix-nwg has been added. The module provides  the  support  for  the  network
              working  group  objects such like Uri object. The module also provides the foundation for the mime
              support.

              <b>Core</b> <b>modules:</b> <b>web</b> <b>module</b>
              The afnix-web module has been removed and replaced by the afnix-wam service.

              <b>Core</b> <b>service:</b> <b>wam</b> <b>service</b>
              The afnix-wam service has been added as the first service into the core  distribution.  A  service
              differs  from  a  module  in  the  sense  that  it  is a combination of different modules. The web
              application management service depends on the xml and nwg modules. The service  provides  all  the
              functionality to support a http session, including xhtml page generation and cgi request reply.

       <b>Release</b> <b>1.3</b>

              ISO-8859  codesets  which  are  mostly  used  for  the encoding of european and arabic characters.
              Depending on the locale settings, the transcoder automatically remaps the 8 bits  characters  into
              their  respective  unicode  character.  All  clients  have been updated to detect their associated
              locale and to set automatically the appropriate transcoder. A new option  -e  has  been  added  to
              force a particular encoding.

              <b>Core</b> <b>language:</b> <b>Logger</b> <b>base</b> <b>class</b>
              A logging base class has been added. The logging facility provides the interface to store messages

              <b>Core</b> <b>language:</b> <b>Date</b> <b>class</b>
              The  Time class has been completely changed and a new Date class has been added. The new mechanism
              provides a better separation between the time and the date, increase the date range and authorizes
              the support for multiple calendar.

              <b>Client:</b> <b>cross</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>client</b>
              The axs client has been modified to support the axs:insert-marker, axs:insert-header  and  insert-
              footer control commands.

              <b>Core</b> <b>modules:</b> <b>speadsheet</b> <b>module</b>
              The Folio and Sheet classes have been substantially updated to support additional information. The
              Sheet  also  supports the concept of markers that marks the sheet columns by literals. The concept
              of column tagging has been added with the associated search methods. All classes also  contain  an
              information  field.  The importation mechanism now supports a cons cell that defines both the cell
              name and the cell value.

              <b>Core</b> <b>modules:</b> <b>web</b> <b>module</b>
              The Table class has been modified to support the concept of  table  data  header.  The  associated
              methods  have  been  added  to  the  class  and  a  new  HtmlTh has been added. The concept of tag
              propagation has also been added. If a tag element already exists, this one is not added.  This  is
              particularly  true for the class tag that is now part of the class constructor. The HtmlPage class
              has been put in strict conformance with xhtml 1.1 and the XHtmlpage class has been removed.

              <b>Core</b> <b>modules:</b> <b>pim</b> <b>module</b>
              A new module called the afnix-pim module has been added to the  base  distribution.  The  personal

              A new module called the afnix-gfx module has been added  to  the  base  distribution.  The  module
              contains  the  base  class that supports the graph data structure which was previously part of the
              standard library.

       <b>Release</b> <b>1.2</b>

              <b>Core</b> <b>language:</b> <b>Unicode</b> <b>support</b>
              The core engine has been substantially modified to integrate the support for  Unicode  characters.
              Depending on the system settings the reader automatically adjust itself to operate in byte mode or
              in  UTF-8  mode. The String and Character classes are now operating with a Unicode representation.
              The design of an Unicode based engine also impacts several classes  like  the  Regex,  Buffer  and
              stream  classes.  A  new class called Byte is also designed to handle byte character. A new stream
              model with a base Stream class has also been added. The full support with Unicode character is not
              yet completed. In particular, certain codesets are not supported at all. This is particularly true
              with case-conversion functions.

              <b>Core</b> <b>language:</b> <b>orphan</b> <b>instance</b> <b>and</b> <b>reparenting</b>
              The object model now supports the creation of orphan instance which is an instance without a class
              attached to it. The instance can be later bound to a class and such  class  can  even  be  changed
              during the course of the program execution.
