</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       devscripts - scripts to ease the lives of Debian developers

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>devscripts</b>  package  provides  a  collection of scripts which may be of use to Debian developers and
       others wishing to build Debian packages.  For a summary of the available scripts,  please  see  the  file
       <u>/usr/share/doc/devscripts/README.gz</u>,  and for full details, please see the individual manpages.  They are
       contributed by multiple developers; for details of the authors, please see the code or manpages.

       Also, the directory <u>/usr/share/doc/devscripts/examples</u> contains an example <b>exim</b> script for  sorting  mail
       arriving to Debian mailing lists.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Several  scripts  of the devscripts suite use the following environment variables. Check the man pages of
       individual scripts for more details on how the variables are used.

       DEBEMAIL
           Email of the person acting on a given Debian package via devscripts.

       DEBFULLNAME
           Full name (first + family) of the person acting on a given Debian package via devscripts.

              (that  is  .deb, .dsc and .changes files).  It will keep the .diffs and original files, though, so
              that the binaries and other files can be rebuilt if necessary. *

       <u><a href="../man1/debcommit.1.html">debcommit</a></u>(1)
              Commits  changes  to  cvs,  darcs,  svn,  svk,  tla,  bzr,  git,  or  hg,  using  new  entries  in

              A program which examines two .deb files or two .changes files and reports on any difference  found
              in  their file lists.  Useful for ensuring that no files were inadvertently lost between versions.
              Can also examine two .dsc files and report on the changes between source versions.  For  a  deeper
              comparison one can use the diffoscope package. [wdiff, patchutils]*

       <u><a href="../man1/debdiff-apply.1.html">debdiff-apply</a></u>(1)
              Apply unified diffs of two Debian source packages, such as those generated by debdiff, to a target
              Debian  source  package.  Any  changes  to debian/changelog are dealt with specially, to avoid the
              conflicts that changelog diffs typically produce when applied naively. May be used to  check  that
              old  patches  still  apply  to newer versions of those packages. [python3-debian, python3-unidiff,
              quilt]

       <u><a href="../man1/debftbfs.1.html">debftbfs</a></u>(1)

              and title. [postgresql-client, python3-debian, python3-debianbts]

       <u><a href="../man1/debi.1.html">debi</a></u>(1)
              Installs  the  current  package  by using dpkg.  It assumes that the current package has just been
              built (for example by debuild), and the .deb lives in the parent directory, and  will  effectively
              run  dpkg  -i  on  the  .deb. The ability to install the package with a very short command is very
              useful when troubleshooting packages.

       <u><a href="../man1/debootsnap.1.html">debootsnap</a></u>(1)
              Combines debootstrap and snapshot.debian.org to create a chroot containing exactly  the  requested
              selection  of  packages.  This  can  be  used  to re-create a chroot from the past, for example to
              reproduce a bug. The tool is also used by debrebuild to build a package in  a  chroot  with  build
              dependencies  in  the  same  version  as  recorded  in  the  buildinfo  file.  [apt-utils, equivs,
              mmdebstrap, python3-debian, python3-pycurl, python3-requests]

       <u><a href="../man1/debrelease.1.html">debrelease</a></u>(1)
              A wrapper around dupload or dput which figures out which version to upload, and then calls dupload

       <u><a href="../man1/debrebuild.1.html">debrebuild</a></u>(1)
              Given a buildinfo file, builds the referenced source package in an environment documented  in  the
              provided  buildinfo  file.  The  build  can  be  performed by sbuild or other builders in a chroot
              environment created by debootsnap. The generated artifacts will be  verified  against  the  hashes
              from the buildinfo file. [sbuild | mmdebstrap, python3-pycurl, libdpkg-perl]

       <u><a href="../man1/debrepro.1.html">debrepro</a></u>(1)
              A  script  that  tests  reproducibility of Debian packages. It will build a given source directory
              twice, with a set of variation between the first and second build, and compare the binary packages
              produced. If diffoscope is installed, it is used to compare non-matching binaries.  If  disorderfs
              is  installed,  it  is  used  during  the  build  to  inject non-determinism in filesystem listing
              operations. [faketime, diffoscope, disorderfs]

       <u><a href="../man1/debrsign.1.html">debrsign</a></u>(1)
              This transfers a .changes/.dsc pair to a remote machine for  signing,  and  runs  debsign  on  the
              remote machine over an SSH connection. [gnupg, debian-keyring, ssh-client]

       <u><a href="../man1/debsign.1.html">debsign</a></u>(1)
              Use  GNU  Privacy  Guard  to  sign  the  changes (and possibly dsc) files created by running dpkg-
              buildpackage with no-sign options.  Useful if you are building a package on a remote  machine  and
              wish  to sign it on a local one.  This script is capable of automatically downloading the .changes
              and .dsc files from a remote machine. [gnupg, debian-keyring, ssh-client]*

       <u><a href="../man1/debsnap.1.html">debsnap</a></u>(1)

       <u><a href="../man1/debuild.1.html">debuild</a></u>(1)
              A wrapper for building a package (i.e., dpkg-buildpackage) to  avoid  problems  with  insufficient
              permissions  and  wrong  paths  etc.  Debuild  will  set  up the proper environment for building a
              package. Debuild will also run lintian to check that the package does not have  any  major  policy
              violations. [lintian, gnupg]*

       <u><a href="../man1/deb-check-file-conflicts.1.html">deb-check-file-conflicts</a></u>(1)
              Check  (using  apt-file)  if  a  Debian package installs files in the exact same path as any other
              package, and if there are Breaks/Replaces (or Conflicts) defined in debian/control  to  avoid  the
              package installation failing on file conflicts.

       <u><a href="../man1/deb-janitor.1.html">deb-janitor</a></u>(1)
              command-line client for interacting with the Debian Janitor.
