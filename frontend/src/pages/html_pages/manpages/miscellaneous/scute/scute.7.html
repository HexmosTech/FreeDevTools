</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scute.so</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Scute  is  a  PKCS#11  implementation  for the GnuPG Agent using the GnuPG Smart Card Daemon.  Currently,
       OpenPGP and PIV cards are supported.

       Scute enables the use of the OpenPGP smart card or a PIV smart card in  applications  supporting  PKCS#11
       compliant  security  tokens.  The main application at this time is client authentication in Mozilla-based
       web browsers.  In the future, other applications will be supported.

       To prepare your application for use with Scute, you have to load the Scute module  as  a  PKCS#11  module
       into the application.  See below for notes on how to do that with Firefox.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       As  a shared library, <b>scute</b> has no command line options but its behaviour can be modified by the use of a
       global configuration file or with an environment variable (see below).  The global configuration file  is
       expected  as  ‘<u>/etc/gnupg/scute.conf</u>’.  It consists of keywords and values and some meta commands.  There
       is currently only one useful option for general use, the other options are  used  for  debugging.   <b>Scute</b>
       uses the same parser as GnuPG does; thus for the meta commands please consult the GnuPG description.

       Here is the short list of supported keywords:

       <b>only-marked</b>
              Scute consideres only keys having the <b>Use-for-p11</b> as part of their meta data.

       <b>user</b> <u>name</u>
              If  Scute  is running with root permission and this option is used it runs the GnuPG components in
              the context of the user <u>name</u>.  <u>name</u> may either be a name or a numerical UID.  This allows  to  use
              the GnuPG setup of a certain user instead of running it under the root account.  This is needed to
              make Scute work smoothly as a PKCS#11 provider for OpenVPN.  If the current user is not root, this
              option has no effect.

       <b>debug</b> <u>flag</u>
              Useful values for <u>flag</u> are 1 and 3.

       <b>log-file</b> <u>file</u>
              This  has  currently  no  effect but will in a future version write the log to <u>file</u>.  Writing to a
              socket will be possible by prefixing the <u>file</u> with the string <b>socket://</b>.

       <b>assume-single-threaded</b>
              This is a hack to ignore a request to use native  threads  instead  of  user  provided  callbacks.
              Should  only be used with caution if there is no easy way to fix the caller or until we have fixed
              Scute.

       <b>no-chain</b>
              By default, when Scute is asked for a certificate, it returns the requested certificate along with
              the chain of signing certificates.  This option makes Scute return only the leaf certificate.

       In addition to the above configuration file, Scute also reads GnuPG´s ‘<u>common.conf</u>’ in the same way GnuPG
       does.  This way the <b>no-autostart</b> option is detected and Scute will not try to launch gpg-agent, which  it
       usually  does.   The important use-case here is running Scute on a server with the gpg-agent on a desktop
       box.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>(FIREFOX)</b></h4><pre>
       To use Scute with Firefox or Thunderbird, follow these instructions:

       From the menu choose <b>Edit-&gt;Preferences</b>.  In the preferences configuration dialog,  you  then  select  the
       <b>Advanced</b>  configuration  section, then the <b>Security</b> tab, and then select <b>Security</b> <b>Devices</b> in the category
       <b>Certificates</b>.  In the devices manager dialog, you can select <b>Load</b> to load a new PKCS#11 device.   In  the
       pop-up  dialog  that  follows,  you  can  give a module name (e.g. ``<b>Scute</b>'') and a module filename.  The
       latter should correspond to the full file name of the installed Scute module file ‘<u>scute.so</u>’.

       The default installation path is ‘<u><a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a></u>’, which would mean that you have  to  provide  the  file
       name  ‘<u>/usr/local/lib/scute.so</u>’.   If  you  or  your  system administrator installed Scute in a different
       location, you have to adjust the file name correspondingly.

       After confirming installation of the security device, a pop-up window should confirm that the module  was
       successfully loaded, and an entry for the security device should appear in the device manager list of

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  environment  variable  <b>SCUTE_DEBUG</b>  gives the same debug flags as described above.  This numerically
       value may be followed by a colon and the name for the log file.  The global options will  override  these
       values once they have been parsed.
