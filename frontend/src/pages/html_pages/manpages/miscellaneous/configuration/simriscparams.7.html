</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       simriscparams - The description of the  configuration files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  page describes the organization of the <b>simrisc</b> configuration files.  These files are formatted like
       standard unix configuration files. Lines are interpreted after removing initial white-space  (blanks  and
       tabs)  and after removing all characters from lines starting at the first <u>#</u> character: this is considered
       comment and is ignored. If a line (not containing a <u>#</u> character) ends in a backslash (<u>\</u>), then  the  next
       line (initial white-space removed) is appended to the current line.

       Note  that  all  parameter  identifiers  are  interpreted  case  sensitively. E.g., <u>Costs:</u> is a different
       parameter than <u>costs:</u>. The numeric values used in this man-page are for illustration purposes only.  Some
       restrictions apply though: standard deviations cannot be negative; proportions and probabilities must lie
       in  the  range  0..1;  multiple probabilities (like the ones used for breast densities) must add up to 1;
       etc. If restrictions apply then they are mentioned at the various parameter descriptions below.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file provided in the <b>simrisc</b> distribution is
       <u>/usr/share/doc/simrisc/simrisc.gz</u>.

       Usually this file is unzipped by the user to the user’s <u><a href="file:~/.config">~/.config</a></u> directory:

           gunzip &lt; /usr/share/doc/simrisc/simrisc.gz &gt; <a href="file:~/.config/">~/.config/</a>

       whereafter <u><a href="file:~/.config/simrisc">~/.config/simrisc</a></u> can be edited to contain local modifications.

       Various parameters specify probability distributions. Usually the <u>Normal</u> distribution is  specified.  The
       program  also  recognizes  the  <u>LogNormal</u>  and <u>Uniform</u> distributions, and uses the <u>Beta</u> distribution when
       handling parameter variations of the beta parameter used for  lung  cancer  simulations  (note  that  the
       similarity of the names <u>beta</u> (the parameter) and <u>Beta</u> (the distribution) is sheer accidentally).

       Parameter  specifications  start  with keywords, followed by a colon. All keywords are covered below. The
       format of the specifications is fixed, but empty lines and  white  space  may  be  used  to  improve  the
       specifications’ readabilities.

       Parameter  specifications  starting  with  uppercase  letters  (like <u>Scenario:</u>) specify (sub)sections and
       contain no additional specifications. Specifications starting with lowercase letters (like <u>ageGroup:</u>) are
       followed by actual parameter values.

       The configuration file must define all  parameters  of  all  configuration  sections,  but  configuration
       parameters  can  be  modified  using  a  separate  analysis  file or they can be modified by command-line
       parameters.

       Several section namess are optional, e.g., `<u>Scenario:</u>’.  In  this  manual  page  the  label  `<u>(opt.)</u>’  is
       appended to the names of those sections. In actual confiuration specifications they can stil be used, but
       they can also completely be omitted.

</pre><h4><b>Section</b> <b>`Scenario:’</b> <b>(opt.)</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  may  start  with  a line containing <u>Scenario:</u> and specifies some general parameters of the
       simulation process. The default configuration file contains the following specifications:

       o      <u>spread:</u> <u>false</u>
              when specified as <u>true</u> parameter spreading is used;

       o      <u>iterations:</u>  <u>1</u>
              the (positive) number of iterations used in a simulation loop;

       o      <u>generator:</u> <u>fixed</u>
              in addition to <u>fixed</u> the modes <u>random</u> and <u>increasing</u> are available.
              This parameter specificies the way <u>simrisc’s</u> random number generators are initialized.  When  mode
              <u>fixed</u>  is used the random number generators are initialized with <u>seed’s</u> value; mode <u>random</u> results
              in the random number generators being initialized by randomly selected seeds and <u>seed</u>  (below)  is
              not  used;  mode <u>increasing</u> results in incrementing the seeds of the random number generators by a
              fixed increment at each iteration;

       o      <u>seed:</u> <u>1</u>
              the (positive) value to seed the random number generator with.  This  parameter  is  ignored  when
              <u>generator:</u> <u>random</u> was specified;

       o      <u>cases:</u> <u>1000</u>
              the (positive) number of cases being simulated;

       o      <u>death:</u> <u>...</u>
              the  <u>death:</u>  parameter may either be followed by the path to a file (if its initial character is a
              tilde (~) it is replaced by the user’s home directory; if it’s a plus (+) it is  replaced  by  the
              base  directory  (specified  with  the <u>--base</u> option, see the <b><a href="../man1/simrisc.1.html">simrisc</a></b>(1) man-page)), or it must be
              followed by 101 cumulative death proportions, where each line starts with <u>&lt;nr&gt;:</u>, where <u>&lt;nr&gt;</u> is the
              next order number to read. The default configuration file specifies:

                 death:
                    1: .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000
                   11: .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000
                   21: .00000 .00014 .00028 .00042 .00056 .00070 .00106 .00142 .00178 .00214
                   31: .00250 .00382 .00514 .00646 .00778 .00910 .01118 .01326 .01534 .01742
                   41: .01950 .02312 .02674 .03036 .03398 .03760 .04414 .05068 .05722 .06376
                   51: .07030 .07776 .08522 .09268 .10014 .10760 .11564 .12368 .13172 .13976
                   61: .14780 .15718 .16656 .17594 .18532 .19470 .20658 .21846 .23034 .24222
                   71: .25410 .27560 .29710 .31860 .34010 .36160 .39368 .42576 .45784 .48992
                   81: .52200 .56240 .60280 .64320 .68360 .72400 .75826 .79252 .82678 .86104
                   91: .89530 .90962 .92394 .93826 .95258 .96690 .97104 .97518 .97932 .98346
                  101: .98760

              which are the 101 cumulative death proportions used for breast cancer simulations.

              If the 101 cumulative death proportions are available in, e.g., the user’s <u>.config/</u>  directory  as
              the file <u>cumdeath</u> then the specification could have been:

                  death:  <a href="file:~/.config/cumdeath">~/.config/cumdeath</a>

              which  might  be  convenient  when using different values in <u>Analysis:</u> specifications (see section
              <u>ANALYSES</u> in the <b><a href="../man1/simrisc.1.html">simrisc</a></b>(1) man-page).

</pre><h4><b>Section</b> <b>`Costs:’</b> <b>(opt.)</b></h4><pre>
       This section may start  with  a  line  containing  <u>Costs:</u>  and  specifies  several  parameters  used  for
       cost-calculations.  Modality-specific  cost  parameters are specified in Section <u>Modalities:</u> (see below).
       The default configuration file specifies:

       o      <u>biop:</u> <u>176</u>
              the (positive) cost of performing a biopsy;

       o      <u>diameters:</u> <u>0:</u> <u>6438</u>  <u>20:</u> <u>7128</u>  <u>50:</u> <u>7701</u>
              pairs of <u>diameter:</u> <u>cost</u> values specifying the treatment  cost  starting  at  the  specified  tumor
              diameter,  up to the next pair’s diameter (if specified) or all diameters starting at the diameter
              specified at the last pair. The first diameter <u>must</u> be 0. The second value of each pair  specifies
              the (non-negative) treatment costs for that age-group.

       o      <u>Discount:</u> <u>(opt.)</u>
              the  costs  discount  proportion  starting at some age. This line is optional but the followed two
              additional lines are required: the line <u>discount:</u> contains two  values  specifying,  respectively,
              the  discount  proportions  for  breast-  and lung-cancer simulations. When only one proportion is
              specified it represents the proportion of the actually used  simulation  type  (i.e.,  breast-  or
              lung-cancer); the line <u>age:</u> specifies the discount’s starting age (for both simulation types):

                  Discount:       # breast    lung
                      proportion:      0      .04
                      age: 50

</pre><h4><b>Section</b> <b>`BreastDensities:’</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  starts  with  a  line  containing  <u>BreastDensities:</u>  which  are  used  with  breast-cancer
       simulations. It defines breast density values for various age groups, covering ages 0 through the maximum
       age for simulated cases. The default configuration file contains the following specifications:

           #                  bi-rad:  a       b       c       d
           ageGroup:  0  - 40         0.05    0.30    0.48    0.17
                      40 - 50         0.06    0.34    0.47    0.13
                      50 - 60         0.08    0.50    0.37    0.05
                      60 - 70         0.15    0.53    0.29    0.03
                      70 - *          0.18    0.54    0.26    0.02

       Optionally, each line may start with  an  <u>ageGroup:</u>  specification,  which  is  required  for  the  first
       specification line.
       Age  groups  are  half-open ranges: starting at their first ages, and endinf at (but not including) their
       second ages. The first ages of subsequent age groups must be equal to the second ages of  their  previous
       age  groups. For the last age group the specification <u>*</u> can be used, indicating that all ages at or above
       the last age group’s begin age are handled by that group.
       For each age group the probabilities of the four bi-rad classifications must sum to 1.0.

</pre><h4><b>Section</b> <b>Modalities:</b> <b>(opt.)</b></h4><pre>
       This section may start with a line  containing  <u>Modalities:</u>  and  specifies  cancer-scanning  modalities.
       Currently  three  modalities  are  supported  for  breast-cancer  simulations:  <u>Mammo,</u> <u>Tomo,</u> <u>MRI</u>, and one
       modality is supported for lung-cancer simulations: <u>CT</u>.

       Some modalities specify age groups, which are (like the age ranges used  for  <u>breastDensities</u>)  half-open
       ranges:  they  start  at their first ages, and end at (not including) their second-ages, while subsequent
       age ranges must connect. Also, the last age group may use the end-age specification <u>*</u>.

       The default configuration file contains (below the line <u>Modalities:</u>)  the  following  specifications  (if
       modalities aren’t used their specifications are optional):

       o      <u>CT:</u>
              The  <u>CT</u>  modality  is  used  when performing lung cancer simulations. The screening costs are used
              instead of the value configured at the <u>Costs:</u> <u>biop:</u> specification. The <u>diagnosis:</u> costs  specifies
              the  costs  of performing a CT-scan. The <u>M0</u> and <u>M1</u> values specify the costs when, respectively, no
              metastatis or a matastasis has been detected.

              The radiation dose of <u>CT</u> scans is configured at  the  <u>CT:</u>  <u>dose:</u>  specification.  The  sensitivity
              depends  on  the  tumor  diameter. For tumor sizes between 3 and 5 mm. the sensitivity is computed
              using the formula <u>(.5</u> <u>*</u> <u>diameter</u> <u>-</u> <u>1..5)</u> <u>*</u> <u>100</u> (e.g., 50% for tumors of 4 mm.)

              The default configuration file contains the following <u>CT</u> specifications:

                  CT:
                      #        screening    diagnosis    M0      M1   (M0, M1: Table S3)
                      costs:      176         1908      37909   56556

                      dose:  1

                      #               diam.   value (must be integral 0..100 or -1)
                      sensitivity:    0 - 3:  0
                                      3 - 5:  -1  # formula: (.5 * diam - 1.5) * 100
                                      5 - *:  100

                      #               mean    stddev  dist
                      specificity:    .992    .076    Normal

              Optionally, each <u>sensitivity</u> specification line may start with a <u>sensitivity:</u> specification, which
              is required for the first specification line.

       o      <u>Mammo:</u>
              For the <u>Mammo</u> modality the costs, radiation doses  and  <u>m:</u>  parameter  specifications  per  bi-rad
              category,  specificity  probabilities for age groups, the parameters of the beta-function, and the
              systematic error probability must be specified.
              The <u>Mammo</u> sensitivity is computed using the  beta-function  published  by  Isheden  and  Humphreys
              (2017,  Statistical  Methods  in  Medical  Research,  <a href="../man3/28.3.html">28</a>(3),  681-702).  From a randomly generated
              probability and the case’s age the case’s bi-rad category is determined and that category is  then
              used to select the m-parameter that is used in the beta-function.
              The default configuration file contains the following <u>Mammo</u> specifications:

                  Mammo:
                      costs:          64

                      #      bi-rad:  a       b       c       d
                      dose:           3       3       3       3
                      m:             .136    .136    .136    .136

                      #             ageGroups:
                      specificity:  0 - 40:  .961     40 - *: .965

                      #       1       2       3        4
                      beta:  -4.38    .49     -1.34    -7.18

                      systematicError:  0.1

       o      <u>Tomo:</u>
              For  the  <u>Tomo</u>  modality the costs, radiation doses per bi-rad category, sensitivity probabilities
              per bi-rad category, and specificity probabilities for age groups must be specified.
              The default configuration file contains the following <u>Tomo</u> specifications:

                  Tomo:
                      costs:         64

                      #      bi-rad:  a       b       c       d
                      dose:           3       3       3       3
                      sensitivity:    .87     .84     .73     .65

                      #             ageGroups:
                      specificity:  0 - 40:  .961     40 - *: .965

       o      <u>MRI:</u>
              For the <u>MRI</u> modality the  costs,  and  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  probabilities  must  be
              specified.
              The default configuration file contains (below the line <u>MRI:</u>) the following specifications:

                      costs:         280
                      #                 proportion:
                      sensitivity:      .94
                      specificity:      .95

</pre><h4><b>Section</b> <b>`Screening:’</b> <b>(opt.)</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  may  start with a line containing <u>Screening:</u> and it specifies the ages at which screenings
       are performed, the used screening modality/modalities for each  of  the  used  screening  ages,  and  the
       probabilities  that  screening  rounds are attended. If no screening rounds should be used then specify a
       single round-specification line:

           round: none

       Otherwise, the first screening round must start with the keyword <u>round:</u> followed by an age, which in turn
       is followed by a list of at least one space delimited modality specification. Subsequent screening  round
       specifications  may  optionally  start  with  the  keyword  <u>round:</u>. Currently <u>Mammo,</u> <u>Tomo,</u> <u>MRI</u> and <u>CT</u> are
       available. <u>Mammo,</u> <u>Tomo,</u> and <u>MRI</u> can be specified when performing breast-cancer  simulations,  <u>CT</u>  can  be
       specified  when performing lung-cancer simulations. The default configuration file contains the following
       <u>round</u> specifications:

           # round:     50  CT
           #            52  CT
           #            54  CT
           #            56  CT
           #            58  CT
           #            60  CT
           #            62  CT
           #            64  CT
           #            66  CT
           #            68  CT

       The probability that a case will attend a screening round is specified by the <u>attendanceRate:</u> parameter:

           attendanceRate:     .8

</pre><h4><b>Section</b> <b>`Tumor:’</b> <b>(opt.)</b></h4><pre>
       This section may start with a line containing <u>Tumor:</u> and it  specifies  the  characteristics  of  tumors.
       Several  of  the  parameters  in  this  section  can  be varied by specifying <u>spread:</u> <u>true</u> in the section
       <u>Scenario:</u>, in which case statistical variations are applied to these parameters.

       Supported distributions are <u>Normal,</u> <u>Uniform,</u> <u>LogNormal,</u> and (for the lung-cancer’s <u>Beir7</u> parameters)  the
       <u>Beta</u>  distribution.  If  <u>value</u>  is  the  specified <u>value</u> parameter value, and <u>spread</u> the specified <u>spread</u>
       parameter then the values that are actually used during the simulations are:

       o      when using the <u>Normal</u> distribution <u>N(mean,</u> <u>stddev)</u>:
                 N(value, spread)

       o      when using the <u>Uniform</u> distribution <u>U(begin,</u> <u>end)</u>:
                 U(value - spread / 2, value + spread / 2)

       o      when using the <u>LogNormal</u> distribution <u>L(mean,</u> <u>stddev)</u>:
                 L(value, spread)

       o      the <u>Beta</u> distribution is used when requestin lung cancer  simulations.  For  male  cases  the  95%
              confidence  intervals  for  the <u>beta</u> parameters ranges from .15 to .70, for female cases it ranges
              from .94 to 2.10, and values drawn from these distributions are used when <u>spread:</u>  <u>true</u>  has  been
              specified (see also section <b>BETA</b> <b>DISTRIBUTIONS</b>).

       The  <u>spread</u> parameters may not be negative. If <u>spread</u> values are configured then their distributions must
       also be specified.  If <u>spread</u> is not specified, then the <u>value</u> parameter won’t vary if  <u>spread:</u>  <u>true</u>  is
       specified  in the <u>Scenario</u> section. The same holds true for the <u>Beta</u> distribution: if no spreading should
       be applied, even though <u>spread:</u> <u>true</u> was specified, then the <u>Beta</u> distribution’s specificatins should  be
       omitted.

       The <u>Tumor:</u> section has four subsections: <u>Beir7:,</u> <u>Growth,</u> <u>Incidence:,</u> <u>Survival:,</u> and <u>S3:</u>. They contain the
       following parameter specifications:

       <b>Beir7:</b>

       BEIR  (tumor  induction)  parameters:  only  tumor  induction  type  7 (i.e., beir7) is used. The default
       configuration file contains specifications for breast cancer simulations and for  male  and  female  lung
       cancer simulations:

               #    eta   beta  spread   dist.
           breast:  -2.0   0.51   0.32  Normal

           #                            Beta-distribution parameters:
           # LC:    eta   beta  dist    constant factor   aParam    bParam
           male:    -1.4   .32  Beta    .234091  1.72727  2.664237  5.184883
           female:  -1.4  1.40  Beta    .744828   .818966 3.366115  4.813548

       If  <u>spread:</u>  <u>true</u>  is  specified  then  the actually used <u>beta</u> parameters are drawn from their respective
       distributions.

       <b>Growth:</b>

       Tumor growth specifications consist of three  elements:  start  diameters,  self-detect  parameterss  and
       doubling time specifications.

       The  <u>start</u>  parameters  define  the  start  diameters  (in  millimeters)  of  emerging  tumors  used with
       respectively, breast and lung cancer simulations. The default configuration file specifies

               # breast lung
           start:   5     3

       The default configuration file contains the following specifications of the  self-detect  parameters  for
       breast and lung cancer simulations:

           #selfDetect:      # stdev      mean     spread    dist
         breast:             2.01375     18.5413   2.31637   Normal
         lung:               1.0141      20.8426   1.84043   Normal

       Four  parameters  are  used  when  determining  the  diameter  at which self-detection is possible. These
       parameters are:

       o      the standard deviation (<u>stdev</u>) used by the lognormal distribution to compute the diameter at which
              self-detection occurs. This parameter is required and cannot be negative;

       o      the <u>mean</u> (see below) used by the lognormal distribution. This parameter is required and cannot  be
              negative. Its value will vary using the following two parameters if <u>spread:</u> <u>true</u> was specified;

       o      the  spread (standard deviation) used by the distribution that is used to vary the mean if <u>spread:</u>
              <u>true</u> was specified. It can be omitted in which case the mean won’t vary;

       o      the distribution used to vary the mean. If the previous parameter is omitted then  this  parameter
              must also be omitted.

       The actually used self-detect diameter is computed using:

           diameter = L(mean, stdev)

       Finally,  the  <u>Growth:</u>  subsection  also  defines  tumor doubling times for various age groups when using
       breast cancer simulations and for all ages when using lung cancer simulations.

       Doubling times are computed like  the  self-detect  diameters,  i.e.,  using  millimeters  and  lognormal
       distributions.  Thus, for each age group and for the lung cancer simulation four parameters are specified
       (of which the final two are optional): the standard deviation of the  lognormal  distribution,  the  mean
       value  of  the  lognormal  distribution,  and  the  spread and name of the distribution that is used when
       <u>spread:</u> <u>true</u> was specified.

       The age groups (used with breast cancer simulations) must cover  ages  0  through  the  maximum  age  for
       simulated  cases,  and  are specified as described at section <u>BreastDensities:</u>. The default configuration
       file contains the following specifications:

           DoublingTime:
               #                    stdev      mean     spread   dist.
               ageGroup:  1 - 50:   1.84043    79.838   1.53726  Normal
                         50 - 70:   1.29693    157.591  1.1853   Normal
                         70 - * :   1.56831    188.67   1.2586   Normal

               #     all ages        stdev     mean     spread   dist.
               lung:                 1.23368   98.4944  2.09594  Normal

       Optionally, each <u>ageGroup</u> line may start with an <u>ageGroup:</u> specification, which is required for the first
       specification line.

       <b>Incidence:</b> <b>(opt.)</b>

       For breast cancer simulations three carrier types are supported: <u>Normal,</u> <u>BRCA1</u> and <u>BRCA2</u>. Each  having  a
       probability  of  occurrence.  The  probabilities  of  these  carriers  must  add  to  1.  In  the default
       configuration file <u>BRCA1</u> and <u>BRCA2</u> are specified, but their probabilties are set  to  0,  in  which  case
       their specifications can also be removed from configuration files.

       Each  carrier is identified by name (i.e., when performing breast cancer simulations <u>Breast:,</u> <u>BRCA1:</u>, and
       <u>BRCA2</u>; when  performing  lung  cancer  simulations:  <u>Male:</u>  and  <u>Female:</u>)  followed  by  their  parameter
       specifications:

       o      for breast cancer simulations: the probability that the carrier is observed;

       o      the lifetime risk: three parameters specifying a probability;

       o      the mean age: three parameters specifying the mean age,;

       o      the standard deviation used when computing the risk of getting a tumor. As this standard deviation
              is used in the denominator of expressions it must be larger than zero.

       The  lifetime risk, mean age and standard deviation parameters may optionally be followed by the standard
       deviation (spread) and distribution used to vary the probability when <u>spread:</u> <u>true</u> is specified;

       The default configuration file contains these specifications:

           Male:
               #                   value   spread  distr.
               lifetimeRisk:         .22   .005    Normal
               meanAge:            72.48  1.08     Normal
               stdDev:              9.28  1.62     Normal

           Female:
               #                   value   spread  distr.
               lifetimeRisk:         .20   .004    Normal
               meanAge:            69.62  1.49     Normal
               stdDev:              9.73  1.83     Normal

           Breast:
               probability:    1
               #                   value   spread  distr.
               lifetimeRisk:         .226  .0053   Normal
               meanAge:            72.9    .552    Normal
               stdDev:             21.1

           BRCA1:
               probability:    0
               #                   value   spread  distr.
               lifetimeRisk:         .96
               meanAge:            53.9
               stdDev:             16.51

            BRCA2:
               probability:    0
               #                   value   spread  distr.
               lifetimeRisk:         .96
               meanAge:            53.9
               stdDev:             16.51

       Instead of specifying the parameters of a distribution, a <u>riskTable</u> can also be used. If a  <u>riskTable</u>  is
       specified at a category (i.e., <u>Male:</u> <u>..</u> <u>BRCA2:</u>) then the <u>lifetimeRisk,</u> <u>meanAge,</u> and <u>stdDev</u> parameters are
       ignored.  A <u>riskTable</u> specification contains pairs of values. The first value of a pair specifies an age,
       the second value the probability of a tumor developing until that age. Both ages and  probabilities  must
       be cumulative and at least two pairs must be specified.

       Unless  specified  in the <u>riskTable</u> specification itself <b>simrisc</b> adds a pair <u>0,</u> <u>.00</u> at the beginning, and
       an age specification <u>100</u>  at  the  end.  Its  cumulative  tumor  probability  is  computed  using  linear
       extrapolation  of  the two age values before age 100, using a maximum value of 1.00.  For ages in between
       pairs of age values linear interpolation is used, using the surrounding age  specifications.  Here  is  a
       (fictitious) example of a <u>riskTable</u> specification in the <u>Male:</u> category:

           Male:
               riskTable:
                   40 .01      50 .1       55 .15      60 .22
                   65 .55      70 .62      75 .67

       <b>Survival:</b> <b>(opt.)</b>

       For  breast  cancer  simulations  four  types  of survival parameters must be specified. Each type (a..d)
       specifies a mean, and (optionally) a spread and distribution (which are used when <u>spread:</u> <u>true</u>  has  been
       specified). The default configuration file specifies:

           #              value        spread      dist:
           type:  a        .00004475   .000004392  Normal
                  b       1.85867      .0420       Normal
                  c       -.271        .0101       Normal
                  d       2.0167       .0366       Normal
                  e       1.00         .01         Normal

       Optionally, each line may start with a <u>type:</u> specification, which is required for the first specification
       line.

       The  <u>e</u>  parameters  can  be  used to estimate relative survival if not enough data are available (and can
       reflect the quality of care). The value 1 indicates that enough data are available to  estimate  survival
       using  the <u>a</u> to <u>d</u> parameters.  If not enough data are available the <u>e</u> parameter can be used to adjust the
       survival estimate to correct the use of the <u>a</u> to <u>f</u> parameters to the quality level of  the  medical  care
       relative  to  a  country  for  which  the  <u>a</u>  to <u>d</u> parameters are available. E.g., in Dutch breast cancer
       research studying the survival in Indonesia the value 0.9 was used since using that factor in combination
       with the provided <u>a</u> to <u>d</u> parameter values the correct survival probabilities for Indonesia were obtained.

       When performing breast cancer simulations TNM indices (cf. the description of the  S3  table  below)  are
       also determined. With breast cancer simulations the second TNM value is always 0, and the first TNM value
       is,  as  with  table  S3, determined by the tumor’s diameter. The default configuration file contains the
       following <u>bc:</u> specification (see also option <u>--tnm</u>):

           #  BC TNM categories thru (&lt;=) diameters (mm):
           bc:        20  50   *
           #  TNM:    T1  T2  T3

       (cf.  https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/breast-cancer/stages-types-grades/tnm-staging).

       For lung cancer simulations table <u>S4</u> is used to determine the a..e parameters.  Table  <u>S4</u>  contains  four
       categories  (lung0..lung3)  defining  these  a..e  parameters,  where (for a known cancer’s diameter) the
       category is randomly determined using table <u>S3</u> (see below).

       Table <u>S4</u> is appended to the breast cancer specifications. The default  configuration  file  contains  the
       following specifications of table <u>S4</u>:

          # table S4: 4 columns per a..d parameter
          # lungX: X is table S4’s column index
          lung0: a        .00143      .00095      Normal

                 e       1.00         .01         Normal

       Optionally,  each  subsequent  line  following  the  first <u>lung0:</u> <u>..</u> <u>lung3:</u> line may repeat its <u>lung1:</u> <u>..</u>
       <u>lung3:</u> label.

       <b>S3:</b> <b>(opt.)</b>

       With lung cancer specifications tables <u>S3</u> and <u>S4</u> are used  to  determine  the  survival  parameters.  The
       tumor’s  diameter  determines  the  row of table S3, and then its column is randomly determined using the
       probabilities listed in S3’s rows. For each row the probabilities must sum to 1. Once the S3  column  has
       been  determined  the column index which of the <u>lungX:</u> specifications is used. The row and column indices
       are 0-based. E.g., if a tumor diameter is 24, then row 2 (diameter &lt;=  30)  is  selected.  Then,  if  the
       random  value  is  .630,  column  1 is used (column N1-3,M0).  Whenever a tumor is present these pairs of
       indices are reported in the comma-separated data file in the column marked as <u>TNM</u>, using  an  entry  like
       <u>2,1</u>.

       The default configuration file contains the following table <u>S3</u>:

           S3:
              #      diameter (mm)
              # T-row    &lt;=       N0,M0   N1-3,M0   N1-3,M1a-b   N0-3M1c
              prob:      10:       .756    .157      .048        .039       # T1a,b

</pre><h4><b>BETA</b> <b>DISTRIBUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Values    generated    from     Beta     distributions     range     between     0     and     1     (cf.
       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution).  The  Beta  distribution  is  computed  using two Gamma
       distributions       (cf.         https://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/datasets/techrep/tr03tb1/tr03tb1/node24.html,
       https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/502146/how-does-numpy-generate-samples-from-a-beta-distribution):

           gamma1 = Gamma(aParam, 1)
           Beta(aParam, bParam) = gamma1 / (gamma1 + Gamma(bParam, 1))

       When  using  lung  cancer  simulations the 95% confidence interval (CI) for male cases ranges from .15 to
       .70, with a mean value of .32, and for women ranging from .94 to 2.10 with a mean value of 1.40.

       The male and female CI ranges are transformed to .025 to .975 ranges  using  linear  transformations.  To
       transform  values  <u>x</u>  from  the male range to the .025 to .975 range the transformation <u>y</u> <u>=</u> <u>1.72727</u> <u>*</u> <u>x</u> <u>-</u>
       <u>.234091</u> is used, and to transform back the transformation <u>(y</u> <u>+</u> <u>.234091)</u>  <u>/</u>  <u>1.72727</u>  is  used.   For  the
       female CI the transformations are <u>y</u> <u>=</u> <u>.818966</u> <u>*</u> <u>x</u> <u>-</u> <u>.744828</u> and <u>(y</u> <u>+</u> <u>.744828)</u> <u>/</u> <u>.818966</u>.

       The  <u>aParam</u>  and  <u>bParam</u>  values are determined by first generating 1000 values so that their CI span the
       range 0.025 to .975, with a mean value of 0.318635 (for male cases) and 0.401724 (for female cases). Next
       the parameters of the corresponding beta distribution were estimated using  maximum  likelihood  fitting,
       resulting  in  <u>aParam</u>  <u>=</u>  <u>2.664237</u>  and  <u>bParam</u> <u>=</u> <u>5.184883</u> for the distribution used with male lungcancer
       simulations, and <u>aParam</u> <u>=</u> <u>3.366115</u> and <u>bParam</u> <u>=</u> <u>4.813548</u> for the distribution used with female lungcancer
       simulations.

       The default configuration file shows these values at the Beir7 beta parameters.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETER</b> <b>RESPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       Parameters can be respecified by defining  a  separate  parameter  configuration  file  or  by  providing
       alternate  parameter  specifications  in  <u>Analysis:</u> sections of the program’s input file, or by providing
       alternative parameter specifications as command-line arguments (cf. the <b><a href="../man1/simrisc.1.html">simrisc</a></b>(1) man-page)

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Configuration</b> <b>files</b>

       o      <u><a href="file:~/.config/simrisc">~/.config/simrisc</a></u>: the default location of the program’s configuration file;

       o      the   <b>simrisc</b>   distribution   archive   contains    the    default    configuration    file    as
              <u>simrisc-VERSION/stdconfig/simrisc</u>, where <u>VERSION</u> is replaced by <b>simrisc</b>’s actual release version;

       o      when  installing  <b>simrisc</b>  using  Linux  distribution  archives  (e.g.,  <u>.deb</u>  files)  the default
              configuration file is commonly available as <u>/usr/shared/doc/simrisc/simrisc.gz</u>
