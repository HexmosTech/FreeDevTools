</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       file-hierarchy - File system hierarchy overview

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Operating systems using the <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) system and service manager are organized based on a file system
       hierarchy inspired by UNIX, more specifically the hierarchy described in the <b>File</b> <b>System</b> <b>Hierarchy</b>[1]
       specification and <b><a href="../man7/hier.7.html">hier</a></b>(7), with various extensions, partially documented in the <b>XDG</b> <b>Base</b> <b>Directory</b>
       <b>Specification</b>[2] and <b>XDG</b> <b>User</b> <b>Directories</b>[3]. This manual page describes a more generalized, though
       minimal and modernized subset of these specifications that defines more strictly the suggestions and
       restrictions systemd makes on the file system hierarchy. Note that this document makes no attempt to
       define the directory structure comprehensively, it only documents a skeleton of a directory tree, that
       downstreams can extend. Because of that traditional directories such as <a href="file:/usr/include/">/usr/include/</a> or <a href="file:/var/spool/">/var/spool/</a> are
       not covered, even though it might (or might not) make a lot of sense to include them in the structure of
       an actually deployed OS.

       Many of the paths described here can be queried with the <b><a href="../man1/systemd-path.1.html">systemd-path</a></b>(1) tool.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>STRUCTURE</b></h4><pre>
       /
           The file system root. Usually writable, but this is not required. Possibly a temporary file system
           ("tmpfs"). Not shared with other hosts (unless read-only).

       <a href="file:/boot/">/boot/</a>
           The boot partition used for bringing up the system. On EFI systems, this is possibly the EFI System
           Partition (ESP), also see <b><a href="../man8/systemd-gpt-auto-generator.8.html">systemd-gpt-auto-generator</a></b>(8). This directory is usually strictly local to
           the host, and should be considered read-only, except when a new kernel or boot loader is installed.
           This directory only exists on systems that run on physical or emulated hardware that requires boot
           loaders.

       /efi/
           If the boot partition <a href="file:/boot/">/boot/</a> is maintained separately from the EFI System Partition (ESP), the latter
           is mounted here. Tools that need to operate on the EFI system partition should look for it at this
           mount point first, and fall back to <a href="file:/boot/">/boot/</a> — if the former does not qualify (for example if it is not
           a mount point or does not have the correct file system type <b>MSDOS_SUPER_MAGIC</b>).

       <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>
           System-specific configuration. This directory may or may not be read-only. Frequently, this directory
           is pre-populated with vendor-supplied configuration files, but applications should not make
           assumptions about this directory being fully populated or populated at all, and should fall back to
           defaults if configuration is missing.

       <a href="file:/home/">/home/</a>
           The location for normal user's home directories. Possibly shared with other systems, and never
           read-only. This directory should only be used for normal users, never for system users. This
           directory and possibly the directories contained within it might only become available or writable in
           late boot or even only after user authentication. This directory might be placed on
           limited-functionality network file systems, hence applications should not assume the full set of file
           API is available on this directory. Applications should generally not reference this directory
           directly, but via the per-user <u>$HOME</u> environment variable, or via the home directory field of the
           user database.

       <a href="file:/root/">/root/</a>
           The home directory of the root user. The root user's home directory is located outside of <a href="file:/home/">/home/</a> in
           order to make sure the root user may log in even without <a href="file:/home/">/home/</a> being available and mounted.

       <a href="file:/srv/">/srv/</a>
           The place to store general server payload, managed by the administrator. No restrictions are made how
           this directory is organized internally. Generally writable, and possibly shared among systems. This
           directory might become available or writable only very late during boot.

       <a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>
           The place for small temporary files. This directory is usually mounted as a "tmpfs" instance, and
           should hence not be used for larger files. (Use <a href="file:/var/tmp/">/var/tmp/</a> for larger files.) This directory is
           usually flushed at boot-up. Also, files that are not accessed within a certain time may be
           automatically deleted.

           If applications find the environment variable <u>$TMPDIR</u> set, they should use the directory specified in
           it instead of <a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a> (see <b><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></b>(7) and <b>IEEE</b> <b>Std</b> <b>1003.1</b>[4] for details).

           Since <a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a> is accessible to other users of the system, it is essential that files and subdirectories
           under this directory are only created with <b><a href="../man3/mkstemp.3.html">mkstemp</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/mkdtemp.3.html">mkdtemp</a></b>(3), and similar calls. For more
           details, see <b>Using</b> <b><a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a></b> <b>and</b> <b><a href="file:/var/tmp/">/var/tmp/</a></b> <b>Safely</b>[5].

</pre><h4><b>RUNTIME</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>
           A "tmpfs" file system for system packages to place runtime data, socket files, and similar. This
           directory is flushed on boot, and generally writable for privileged programs only. Always writable.

       <a href="file:/run/log/">/run/log/</a>
           Runtime system logs. System components may place private logs in this directory. Always writable,
           even when <a href="file:/var/log/">/var/log/</a> might not be accessible yet.

       <a href="file:/run/user/">/run/user/</a>
           Contains per-user runtime directories, each usually individually mounted "tmpfs" instances. Always
           writable, flushed at each reboot and when the user logs out. User code should not reference this
           directory directly, but via the <u>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</u> environment variable, as documented in the <b>XDG</b> <b>Base</b>
           <b>Directory</b> <b>Specification</b>[2].

</pre><h4><b>VENDOR-SUPPLIED</b> <b>OPERATING</b> <b>SYSTEM</b> <b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>
           Vendor-supplied operating system resources. Usually read-only, but this is not required. Possibly
           shared between multiple hosts. This directory should not be modified by the administrator, except
           when installing or removing vendor-supplied packages.

       <a href="file:/usr/bin/">/usr/bin/</a>
           Binaries and executables for user commands that shall appear in the <u>$PATH</u> search path. It is
           recommended not to place binaries in this directory that are not useful for invocation from a shell
           (such as daemon binaries); these should be placed in a subdirectory of <a href="file:/usr/lib/">/usr/lib/</a> instead.

       <a href="file:/usr/lib/">/usr/lib/</a>
           Static, private vendor data that is compatible with all architectures (though not necessarily
           architecture-independent). Note that this includes internal executables or other binaries that are
           not regularly invoked from a shell. Such binaries may be for any architecture supported by the
           system. Do not place public libraries in this directory, use <u>$libdir</u> (see below), instead.

       <a href="file:/usr/lib/">/usr/lib/</a><u>arch-id</u>/
           Location for placing dynamic libraries into, also called <u>$libdir</u>. The architecture identifier to use
           is defined on <b>Multiarch</b> <b>Architecture</b> <b>Specifiers</b> <b>(Tuples)</b>[6] list. Legacy locations of <u>$libdir</u> are
           <a href="file:/usr/lib/">/usr/lib/</a>, <a href="file:/usr/lib64/.">/usr/lib64/.</a> This directory should not be used for package-specific data, unless this data
           is architecture-dependent, too.

           To query <u>$libdir</u> for the primary architecture of the system, invoke:

               systemd-path system-library-arch

       <a href="file:/usr/share/">/usr/share/</a>
           Resources shared between multiple packages, such as documentation, man pages, time zone information,
           fonts and other resources. Usually, the precise location and format of files stored below this
           directory is subject to specifications that ensure interoperability.

           Note that resources placed in this directory typically are under shared ownership, i.e. multiple
           different packages have provided and consumed these resources, on equal footing, without any obvious
           primary owner. This makes things systematically different from <a href="file:/usr/lib/">/usr/lib/</a>, where ownership is
           generally not shared.

       <a href="file:/usr/share/doc/">/usr/share/doc/</a>
           Documentation for the operating system or system packages.

       /usr/share/factory/etc/
           Repository for vendor-supplied default configuration files. This directory should be populated with
           pristine vendor versions of all configuration files that may be placed in <a href="file:/etc/.">/etc/.</a> This is useful to
           compare the local configuration of a system with vendor defaults and to populate the local
           configuration with defaults.

       /usr/share/factory/var/
           Similar to /usr/share/factory/etc/, but for vendor versions of files in the variable, persistent data
           directory <a href="file:/var/.">/var/.</a>

</pre><h4><b>PERSISTENT</b> <b>VARIABLE</b> <b>SYSTEM</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/var/">/var/</a>
           Persistent, variable system data. Writable during normal system operation. This directory might be
           pre-populated with vendor-supplied data, but applications should be able to reconstruct necessary
           files and directories in this subhierarchy should they be missing, as the system might start up
           without this directory being populated. Persistency is recommended, but optional, to support
           ephemeral systems. This directory might become available or writable only very late during boot.
           Components that are required to operate during early boot hence shall not unconditionally rely on
           this directory.

       <a href="file:/var/cache/">/var/cache/</a>
           Persistent system cache data. System components may place non-essential data in this directory.
           Flushing this directory should have no effect on operation of programs, except for increased runtimes
           necessary to rebuild these caches.

       <a href="file:/var/lib/">/var/lib/</a>
           Persistent system data. System components may place private data in this directory.

       <a href="file:/var/log/">/var/log/</a>
           Persistent system logs. System components may place private logs in this directory, though it is
           recommended to do most logging via the <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3) and <b><a href="../man3/sd_journal_print.3.html">sd_journal_print</a></b>(3) calls.

       <a href="file:/var/tmp/">/var/tmp/</a>
           The place for larger and persistent temporary files. In contrast to <a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>, this directory is usually
           mounted from a persistent physical file system and can thus accept larger files. (Use <a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a> for small
           ephemeral files.) This directory is generally not flushed at boot-up, but time-based cleanup of files
           that have not been accessed for a certain time is applied.

           If applications find the environment variable <u>$TMPDIR</u> set, they should use the directory specified in
           it instead of <a href="file:/var/tmp/">/var/tmp/</a> (see <b><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></b>(7) for details).

           The same security restrictions as with <a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a> apply: <b><a href="../man3/mkstemp.3.html">mkstemp</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/mkdtemp.3.html">mkdtemp</a></b>(3), and similar calls should
           be used. For further details about this directory, see <b>Using</b> <b><a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a></b> <b>and</b> <b><a href="file:/var/tmp/">/var/tmp/</a></b> <b>Safely</b>[5].

</pre><h4><b>VIRTUAL</b> <b>KERNEL</b> <b>AND</b> <b>API</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>SYSTEMS</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>
           The root directory for device nodes. Usually, this directory is mounted as a "devtmpfs" instance, but
           might be of a different type in sandboxed/containerized setups. This directory is managed jointly by
           the kernel and <b><a href="../man8/systemd-udevd.8.html">systemd-udevd</a></b>(8), and should not be written to by other components. A number of
           special purpose virtual file systems might be mounted below this directory.

       <a href="file:/dev/shm/">/dev/shm/</a>
           Place for POSIX shared memory segments, as created via <b><a href="../man3/shm_open.3.html">shm_open</a></b>(3). This directory is flushed on
           boot, and is a "tmpfs" file system. Since all users have write access to this directory, special care
           should be taken to avoid name clashes and vulnerabilities. For normal users, shared memory segments
           in this directory are usually deleted when the user logs out. Usually, it is a better idea to use
           memory mapped files in <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a> (for system programs) or <u>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</u> (for user programs) instead of
           POSIX shared memory segments, since these directories are not world-writable and hence not vulnerable
           to security-sensitive name clashes.

       <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>
           A virtual kernel file system exposing the process list and other functionality. This file system is
           mostly an API to interface with the kernel and not a place where normal files may be stored. For
           details, see <b><a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</a></b>(5). A number of special purpose virtual file systems might be mounted below this
           directory.

       <a href="file:/proc/sys/">/proc/sys/</a>
           A hierarchy below <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a> that exposes a number of kernel tunables. The primary way to configure the
           settings in this API file tree is via <b><a href="../man5/sysctl.d.5.html">sysctl.d</a></b>(5) files. In sandboxed/containerized setups, this
           directory is generally mounted read-only.

       <a href="file:/sys/">/sys/</a>
           A virtual kernel file system exposing discovered devices and other functionality. This file system is
           mostly an API to interface with the kernel and not a place where normal files may be stored. In
           sandboxed/containerized setups, this directory is generally mounted read-only. A number of special
           purpose virtual file systems might be mounted below this directory.

       <a href="file:/sys/fs/cgroup/">/sys/fs/cgroup/</a>
           A virtual kernel file system exposing process control groups (cgroups). This file system is an API to
           interface with the kernel and not a place where normal files may be stored. On current systems
           running in the default "unified" mode, this directory serves as the mount point for the "cgroup2"
           filesystem, which provides a unified cgroup hierarchy for all resource controllers. On systems with
           non-default configurations, this directory may instead be a tmpfs filesystem containing mount points
           for various "cgroup" (v1) resource controllers; in such configurations, if "cgroup2" is mounted it
           will be mounted on /sys/fs/cgroup/unified/, but cgroup2 will not have resource controllers attached.
           In sandboxed/containerized setups, this directory may either not exist or may include a subset of
           functionality.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>SYMLINKS</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/bin/">/bin/</a>, <a href="file:/sbin/">/sbin/</a>, <a href="file:/usr/sbin/">/usr/sbin/</a>
           These compatibility symlinks point to <a href="file:/usr/bin/">/usr/bin/</a>, ensuring that scripts and binaries referencing these
           legacy paths correctly find their binaries.

       <a href="file:/lib/">/lib/</a>
           This compatibility symlink points to <a href="file:/usr/lib/">/usr/lib/</a>, ensuring that programs referencing this legacy path
           correctly find their resources.

       <a href="file:/lib64/">/lib64/</a>
           On some architecture ABIs, this compatibility symlink points to <u>$libdir</u>, ensuring that binaries
           referencing this legacy path correctly find their dynamic loader. This symlink only exists on
           architectures whose ABI places the dynamic loader in this path.

       <a href="file:/var/run/">/var/run/</a>
           This compatibility symlink points to <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>, ensuring that programs referencing this legacy path
           correctly find their runtime data.

</pre><h4><b>HOME</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b></h4><pre>
       User applications may want to place files and directories in the user's home directory. They should
       follow the following basic structure. Note that some of these directories are also standardized (though
       more weakly) by the <b>XDG</b> <b>Base</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Specification</b>[2]. Additional locations for high-level user
       resources are defined by <b>xdg-user-dirs</b>[3].

       <a href="file:~/.cache/">~/.cache/</a>
           Persistent user cache data. User programs may place non-essential data in this directory. Flushing
           this directory should have no effect on operation of programs, except for increased runtimes
           necessary to rebuild these caches. If an application finds <u>$XDG_CACHE_HOME</u> set, it should use the
           directory specified in it instead of this directory.

       <a href="file:~/.config/">~/.config/</a>
           Application configuration. When a new user is created, this directory will be empty or not exist at
           all. Applications should fall back to defaults should their configuration in this directory be
           missing. If an application finds <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</u> set, it should use the directory specified in it
           instead of this directory.

       <a href="file:~/.local/bin/">~/.local/bin/</a>
           Executables that shall appear in the user's <u>$PATH</u> search path. It is recommended not to place
           executables in this directory that are not useful for invocation from a shell; these should be placed
           in a subdirectory of <a href="file:~/.local/lib/">~/.local/lib/</a> instead. Care should be taken when placing architecture-dependent
           binaries in this place, which might be problematic if the home directory is shared between multiple
           hosts with different architectures.

       <a href="file:~/.local/lib/">~/.local/lib/</a>
           Static, private vendor data that is compatible with all architectures.

       <a href="file:~/.local/lib/">~/.local/lib/</a><u>arch-id</u>/
           Location for placing public dynamic libraries. The architecture identifier to use is defined on
           <b>Multiarch</b> <b>Architecture</b> <b>Specifiers</b> <b>(Tuples)</b>[6] list.

       <a href="file:~/.local/share/">~/.local/share/</a>
           Resources shared between multiple packages, such as fonts or artwork. Usually, the precise location
           and format of files stored below this directory is subject to specifications that ensure
           interoperability. If an application finds <u>$XDG_DATA_HOME</u> set, it should use the directory specified
           in it instead of this directory.

       <a href="file:~/.local/state/">~/.local/state/</a>
           Application state. When a new user is created, this directory will be empty or not exist at all.
           Applications should fall back to defaults should their state in this directory be missing. If an
           application finds <u>$XDG_STATE_HOME</u> set, it should use the directory specified in it instead of this
           directory.

</pre><h4><b>WRITE</b> <b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Unprivileged</b> <b>Write</b> <b>Access</b>
       Unprivileged processes generally lack write access to most of the hierarchy.

       The exceptions for normal users are <a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>, <a href="file:/var/tmp/">/var/tmp/</a>, <a href="file:/dev/shm/">/dev/shm/</a>, as well as the home directory <u>$HOME</u>
       (usually found below <a href="file:/home/">/home/</a>) and the runtime directory <u>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</u> (found below <a href="file:/run/user/">/run/user/</a>) of the
       user, which are all writable.

       For unprivileged system processes, only <a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>, <a href="file:/var/tmp/">/var/tmp/</a> and <a href="file:/dev/shm/">/dev/shm/</a> are writable. If an unprivileged
       system process needs a private writable directory in <a href="file:/var/">/var/</a> or <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>, it is recommended to either create
       it before dropping privileges in the daemon code, to create it via <b><a href="../man5/tmpfiles.d.5.html">tmpfiles.d</a></b>(5) fragments during boot,
       or via the <u>StateDirectory=</u> and <u>RuntimeDirectory=</u> directives of service units (see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5) for
       details).

       <a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>, <a href="file:/var/tmp/">/var/tmp/</a> and <a href="file:/dev/shm/">/dev/shm/</a> should be mounted <b>nosuid</b> and <b>nodev</b>, which means that set-user-id mode and
       character or block special devices are not interpreted on those file systems. In general it is not
       possible to mount them <b>noexec</b>, because various programs use those directories for dynamically generated
       or optimized code, and with that flag those use cases would break. Using this flag is OK on
       special-purpose installations or systems where all software that may be installed is known and does not
       require such functionality. See the discussion of <b>nosuid</b>/<b>nodev</b>/<b>noexec</b> in <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8) and <b>PROT_EXEC</b> in
       <b><a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a></b>(2).

   <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>Write</b> <b>Access</b> <b>on</b> <b>Read-Only</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>and</b> <b>during</b> <b>System</b> <b>Recovery</b>
       As noted above, some systems operate with the <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> and <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a> hierarchies mounted read-only, possibly only
       allowing write access during package upgrades. Other part of the hierarchy are generally mounted
       read-write (in particular <a href="file:/var">/var</a> and <a href="file:/var/tmp">/var/tmp</a>), but may be read-only when the kernel remounts the file
       system read-only in response to errors, or when the system is booted read-only for recovery purposes. To
       the extent reasonable, applications should be prepared to execute without write access, so that for
       example, failure to save non-essential data to <a href="file:/var/cache/">/var/cache/</a> or failure to create a custom log file under
       <a href="file:/var/log">/var/log</a> does not prevent the application from running.

       The <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a> directory is available since the earliest boot and is always writable. It should be used for
       any runtime data and sockets, so that write access to e.g.  <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a> or <a href="file:/var">/var</a> is not needed.

</pre><h4><b>NODE</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       Unix file systems support different types of file nodes, including regular files, directories, symlinks,
       character and block device nodes, sockets and FIFOs.

       It is strongly recommended that <a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a> is the only location below which device nodes shall be placed.
       Similarly, <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a> shall be the only location to place sockets and FIFOs. Regular files, directories and
       symlinks may be used in all directories.

       Applications should expect that a security policy might be enforced on a system that enforces these
       rules.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>PACKAGES</b></h4><pre>
       Developers of system packages should follow strict rules when placing their files in the file system. The
       following table lists recommended locations for specific types of files supplied by the vendor.
