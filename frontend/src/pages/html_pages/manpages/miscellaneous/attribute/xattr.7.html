       xattr - Extended attributes

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Extended  attributes  are  name:value pairs associated permanently with files and directories, similar to
       the environment strings associated with a process.  An attribute may be defined or undefined.  If  it  is
       defined, its value may be empty or non-empty.

       Extended  attributes  are extensions to the normal attributes which are associated with all inodes in the
       system (i.e., the <b><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></b>(2)  data).   They  are  often  used  to  provide  additional  functionality  to  a
       filesystemâ€”for  example,  additional  security  features  such  as  Access  Control  Lists  (ACLs) may be
       implemented using extended attributes.

       Users with search access to a file or directory may use <b><a href="../man2/listxattr.2.html">listxattr</a></b>(2) to  retrieve  a  list  of  attribute
       names defined for that file or directory.

       Extended  attributes  are accessed as atomic objects.  Reading (<b><a href="../man2/getxattr.2.html">getxattr</a></b>(2)) retrieves the whole value of
       an attribute and stores it in a buffer.  Writing (<b><a href="../man2/setxattr.2.html">setxattr</a></b>(2)) replaces any previous value with  the  new
       value.

       Space  consumed for extended attributes may be counted towards the disk quotas of the file owner and file
       group.

   <b>Extended</b> <b>attribute</b> <b>namespaces</b>
       Attribute names are null-terminated strings.  The  attribute  name  is  always  specified  in  the  fully
       qualified <u>namespace.attribute</u> form, for example, <u>user.mime_type</u>, <u>trusted.md5sum</u>, <u>system.posix_acl_access</u>,
       or <u>security.selinux</u>.

       The  namespace  mechanism  is  used  to define different classes of extended attributes.  These different
       classes  exist  for  several  reasons;  for  example,  the  permissions  and  capabilities  required  for
       manipulating extended attributes of one namespace may differ to another.

       Currently,  the  <u>security</u>,  <u>system</u>, <u>trusted</u>, and <u>user</u> extended attribute classes are defined as described
       below.  Additional classes may be added in the future.

   <b>Extended</b> <b>security</b> <b>attributes</b>
       The security attribute namespace is used by kernel security modules, such as Security Enhanced Linux, and
       also to implement file capabilities (see <b><a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</a></b>(7)).  Read and write access permissions to security
       attributes depend on the policy implemented for each security attribute by the security module.  When  no
       security  module  is  loaded,  all  processes have read access to extended security attributes, and write
       access is limited to processes that have the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability.

   <b>System</b> <b>extended</b> <b>attributes</b>
       System extended attributes are used by the kernel to store system objects such as Access  Control  Lists.
       Read  and  write access permissions to system attributes depend on the policy implemented for each system
       attribute implemented by filesystems in the kernel.

   <b>Trusted</b> <b>extended</b> <b>attributes</b>
       Trusted extended attributes are visible and accessible only to  processes  that  have  the  <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>
       capability.   Attributes  in this class are used to implement mechanisms in user space (i.e., outside the
       kernel) which keep information in extended attributes to which ordinary processes should not have access.

   <b>User</b> <b>extended</b> <b>attributes</b>
       User extended attributes may be assigned to  files  and  directories  for  storing  arbitrary  additional
       information  such as the mime type, character set or encoding of a file.  The access permissions for user
       attributes are defined by the file permission bits: read permission is required to retrieve the attribute
       value, and writer permission is required to change it.

       The file permission bits of regular files and directories  are  interpreted  differently  from  the  file
       permission  bits  of  special  files  and  symbolic  links.   For  regular files and directories the file
       permission bits define access to the file's contents, while for device special files they  define  access
       to  the  device  described  by  the special file.  The file permissions of symbolic links are not used in
       access checks.  These differences would allow  users  to  consume  filesystem  resources  in  a  way  not
       controllable by disk quotas for group or world writable special files and directories.

       For  this reason, user extended attributes are allowed only for regular files and directories, and access
       to user extended attributes is restricted to the owner and to users  with  appropriate  capabilities  for
       directories with the sticky bit set (see the <b><a href="../man1/chmod.1.html">chmod</a></b>(1) manual page for an explanation of the sticky bit).

   <b>Filesystem</b> <b>differences</b>
       The kernel and the filesystem may place limits on the maximum number and size of extended attributes that
       can  be  associated  with a file.  The VFS-imposed limits on attribute names and values are 255 bytes and
       64 kB, respectively.  The list of attribute names that can be returned is also limited to 64 kB (see BUGS
       in <b><a href="../man2/listxattr.2.html">listxattr</a></b>(2)).

       Some filesystems, such as Reiserfs (and, historically, ext2 and  ext3),  require  the  filesystem  to  be
       mounted with the <b>user_xattr</b> mount option in order for user extended attributes to be used.

       In  the  current  ext2,  ext3, and ext4 filesystem implementations, the total bytes used by the names and
       values of all of a file's extended attributes must fit in a single filesystem block (1024, 2048  or  4096
       bytes, depending on the block size specified when the filesystem was created).

       In  the Btrfs, XFS, and Reiserfs filesystem implementations, there is no practical limit on the number of
       extended attributes associated with  a  file,  and  the  algorithms  used  to  store  extended  attribute
       information on disk are scalable.

       In  the  JFS, XFS, and Reiserfs filesystem implementations, the limit on bytes used in an EA value is the
       ceiling imposed by the VFS.

       In the Btrfs filesystem implementation, the total bytes used for  the  name,  value,  and  implementation
       overhead bytes is limited to the filesystem <u>nodesize</u> value (16 kB by default).

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       Extended  attributes  are  not  specified in POSIX.1, but some other systems (e.g., the BSDs and Solaris)
       provide a similar feature.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Since the filesystems on which extended attributes are stored might also be used on architectures with  a
       different  byte  order  and  machine  word  size,  care  should  be taken to store attribute values in an
       architecture-independent format.
