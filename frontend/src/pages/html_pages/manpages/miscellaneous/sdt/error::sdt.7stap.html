</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       error::sdt - &lt;sys/sdt.h&gt; marker failures

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Systemtap's  <b>&lt;sys/sdt.h&gt;</b>  probes  are modeled after the dtrace USDT API, but are implemented differently.
       They leave a only a NOP instruction in the userspace program's text segment, and add an ELF note  to  the
       binary  with  metadata.   This  metadata  describes  the  marker's name and parameters.  This encoding is
       designed to be parseable by multiple tools (not just systemtap: GDB,  the  GNU  Debugger,  also  contains
       support).  These allow the tools to find parameters and their types, wherever they happen to reside, even
       without DWARF debuginfo.

       The  reason  finding  parameters  is  tricky  is  because  the STAP_PROBE / DTRACE_PROBE markers store an
       assembly language expression for each operand, as a result of use of gcc inline-assembly directives.  The
       compiler is given a broad gcc operand constraint string ("nor") for the  operands,  which  usually  works
       well.   Usually,  it  does  not force the compiler to load the parameters into or out of registers, which
       would slow down an instrumented program.  However, some instrumentation sites with some parameters do not
       work well with the default "nor" constraint.

       unresolveable at run-time
              GCC may emit strings that an assembler could resolve (from the context of compiling  the  original
              program), but a run-time tool cannot.  For example, the operand string might refer to a label of a
              local  symbol  that  is not emitted into the ELF object file at all, which leaves no trace for the
              run-time.  Reference to such  parameters  from  within  systemtap  can  result  in  "SDT  asm  not
              understood" errors.

       too complicated expression
              GCC  might  synthesize  very  complicated  assembly  addressing  modes from complex C data types /
              pointer expressions.  systemtap or gdb may not  be  able  to  parse  some  valid  but  complicated
              expressions.   Reference  to  such  parameters  from  within  systemtap can result in "SDT asm not
              understood" errors.

       overly restrictive constraint
              GCC might not be able to even compile the original program with the default "nor"  constraint  due
              to  shortage  of  registers  or  other reasons.  A compile-time gcc error such as "asm operand has
              impossible constraints" may result.

       There are two general workarounds to this family of problems.

       change the constraints
              While compiling the original  instrumented  program,  set  the  <u>STAP_SDT_ARG_CONSTRAINT</u>  macro  to
              different  constraint  strings.   See  the GCC manual about various options.  For example, on many
              machine architectures, "r" forces operands into registers, and  "g"  leaves  operands  essentially
              unconstrained.

       revert to debuginfo
              As  long as the instrumented program compiles, it may be fine simply to keep using &lt;sys/sdt.h&gt; but
              eschew extraction of a few individual parameters.  In the worst case, disable  &lt;sys/sdt.h&gt;  macros
              entirely  to  eschew  the  compiled-in  instrumentation.   If  DWARF  debuginfo  was generated and
              preserved, a systemtap script could refer to the underlying source context  variables  instead  of
              the positional STAP_PROBE parameters.
