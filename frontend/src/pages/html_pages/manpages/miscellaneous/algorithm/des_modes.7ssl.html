       des_modes - the variants of DES and other crypto algorithms of OpenSSL

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Several crypto algorithms for OpenSSL can be used in a number of modes.  Those are used for using block
       ciphers in a way similar to stream ciphers, among other things.

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Electronic</b> <b>Codebook</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>(ECB)</b>
       Normally, this is found as the function <u>algorithm</u><b>_ecb_encrypt()</b>.

       • 64 bits are enciphered at a time.

       • The order of the blocks can be rearranged without detection.

       • The  same  plaintext  block  always  produces  the  same  ciphertext block (for the same key) making it
         vulnerable to a 'dictionary attack'.

       • An error will only affect one ciphertext block.

   <b>Cipher</b> <b>Block</b> <b>Chaining</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>(CBC)</b>
       Normally, this is found as the function <u>algorithm</u><b>_cbc_encrypt()</b>.  Be aware that <b>des_cbc_encrypt()</b> is  not
       really DES CBC (it does not update the IV); use <b>des_ncbc_encrypt()</b> instead.

       • a multiple of 64 bits are enciphered at a time.

       • The  CBC  mode produces the same ciphertext whenever the same plaintext is encrypted using the same key
         and starting variable.

       • The chaining operation makes the ciphertext blocks dependent on the current and all preceding plaintext
         blocks and therefore blocks can not be rearranged.

       • The use of different starting variables prevents the same plaintext enciphering to the same ciphertext.

       • An error will affect the current and the following ciphertext blocks.

   <b>Cipher</b> <b>Feedback</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>(CFB)</b>
       Normally, this is found as the function <u>algorithm</u><b>_cfb_encrypt()</b>.

       • a number of bits (j) &lt;= 64 are enciphered at a time.

       • The CFB mode produces the same ciphertext whenever the same plaintext is encrypted using the  same  key
         and starting variable.

       • The  chaining  operation  makes  the  ciphertext  variables  dependent on the current and all preceding
         variables and therefore j-bit variables are chained together and can not be rearranged.

       • The use of different starting variables prevents the same plaintext enciphering to the same ciphertext.

       • The strength of the CFB mode depends on the size of k (maximal if j == k).  In my  implementation  this
         is always the case.

       • Selection  of  a small value for j will require more cycles through the encipherment algorithm per unit
         of plaintext and thus cause greater processing overheads.

       • Only multiples of j bits can be enciphered.

       • An error will affect the current and the following ciphertext variables.

   <b>Output</b> <b>Feedback</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>(OFB)</b>
       Normally, this is found as the function <u>algorithm</u><b>_ofb_encrypt()</b>.

       • a number of bits (j) &lt;= 64 are enciphered at a time.

       • The OFB mode produces the same ciphertext whenever the same plaintext enciphered using the same key and
         starting variable.  More over, in the OFB mode the same key stream is produced when the  same  key  and
         start  variable  are used.  Consequently, for security reasons a specific start variable should be used
         only once for a given key.

       • The absence of chaining makes the OFB more vulnerable to specific attacks.

       • The use of different start variables values  prevents  the  same  plaintext  enciphering  to  the  same
         ciphertext, by producing different key streams.

       • Selection  of  a small value for j will require more cycles through the encipherment algorithm per unit
         of plaintext and thus cause greater processing overheads.

       • Only multiples of j bits can be enciphered.

       • OFB mode of operation does not extend ciphertext errors in the resultant plaintext output.   Every  bit
         error in the ciphertext causes only one bit to be in error in the deciphered plaintext.

       • OFB  mode  is not self-synchronizing.  If the two operation of encipherment and decipherment get out of
         synchronism, the system needs to be re-initialized.

       • Each re-initialization should use a value of the start  variable  different  from  the  start  variable
         values  used  before  with  the same key.  The reason for this is that an identical bit stream would be
         produced each time from the same parameters.  This would be susceptible to a 'known plaintext' attack.

   <b>Triple</b> <b>ECB</b> <b>Mode</b>
       Normally, this is found as the function <u>algorithm</u><b>_ecb3_encrypt()</b>.

       • Encrypt with key1, decrypt with key2 and encrypt with key3 again.

       • As for ECB encryption but increases the key length to 168 bits.  There are theoretic attacks  that  can
         be  used  that  make  the  effective  key length 112 bits, but this attack also requires 2^56 blocks of
         memory, not very likely, even for the NSA.

       • If both keys are the same it is equivalent to encrypting once with just one key.

       • If the first and last key are the same, the key length is 112  bits.   There  are  attacks  that  could
         reduce  the  effective  key  strength  to  only  slightly more than 56 bits, but these require a lot of
         memory.

       • If all 3 keys are the same, this is effectively the same as normal ecb mode.

   <b>Triple</b> <b>CBC</b> <b>Mode</b>
       Normally, this is found as the function <u>algorithm</u><b>_ede3_cbc_encrypt()</b>.

       • Encrypt with key1, decrypt with key2 and then encrypt with key3.

       • As for CBC encryption but increases the key length to 168 bits with the same restrictions as for triple
         ecb mode.
