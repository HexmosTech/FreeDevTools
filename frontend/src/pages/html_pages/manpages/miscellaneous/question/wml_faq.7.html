   <b>GENERAL</b> <b>QUESTIONS</b>
       <b>G01:</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>WML?</b>
            WML  is  a  free and extensible Webdesigner's off-line HTML generation toolkit for Unix, distributed
            under the GNU General Public License (GPL v2).

            WML consists of a control frontend driving  up  to  nine  backends  in  a  sequential  pass-oriented
            filtering  scheme.  Each  backend  provides  one  particular  core  language.  For maximum power WML
            additionally ships with a well-suited set of include files which provide higher-level features build
            on top of the backends core languages. While not trivial and idiot proof WML provides  most  of  the
            core features real hackers always wanted for HTML generation.

       <b>G02:</b> <b>WML</b> <b>is</b> <b>distributed</b> <b>as</b> <b>free</b> <b>software,</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge?</b>
            Yes,  WML  can be distributed free of charge and used free of charge without any exceptions. You can
            even use WML to generate a commercial website, no problem.  But please give  credit  to  the  author
            where  credit  is  due.  Either  by  using  <b>wml::std::<a href="../man3/info.3.html">info</a></b>(3)  which includes a WML identifier or by
            explicitly saying somewhere on the generated website that you used WML. This just would be fair.

       <b>G03:</b> <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>WML</b> <b>a</b> <b>toolkit</b> <b>of</b> <b>disjunct</b> <b>programs</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>big</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>program?</b>
            The first reason is because WML was born out of the need to generate a huge webarea in  spring  1997
            (<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/">http://www.engelschall.com/sw/</a>)  and  an  appropriate  tool  had to be found in finite time. So the
            author decided to use maximum software leverage and just compiled a toolkit of existing programs and
            only programmed the missing stuff itself.

            After this approach showed that WML is flexible and powerful enough as the solution to generate huge
            webareas, the author started to compactify it and stripped the toolkit to its essential  parts.  But
            it is still a toolkit, even when you have only one frontend to control the parts.

       <b>G04:</b> <b>Which</b> <b>tools</b> <b>are</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>WML</b> <b>distribution?</b>
            Well,  you certainly know "wml", the front-end for WML.  But there are other cool front-ends for the
            most useful tasks:

            "wmk" - Website META Language Make
                Build your web pages without writing Makefiles.

            "wmd" - Website META Language Documentation Browser
                This is your visa for all the documentation you want.

            "wmb" - Website META Language Bug Reporting Tool
                The preferred way to report a bug, this tool will send  a  mail  to  the  maintainer  with  your
                problem and the characteristics of your installation.

            "wmu" - Website META Language Upgrade Utility
                Upgrade  and  build  new  versions  of  WML like a charm, with the same options as those of your
                current installation.

       <b>G05:</b> <b>WML</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can,</b> <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>even</b> <b>any</b> <b>restrictions?</b>
            Sure, WML has some restrictions which cannot be eliminated easily.

            o there is no real debugging mode which makes tracing back of problems very hard, especially for the
              ePerl pass.  Currently the best way to debug is to use the <b>-p</b> option with args `1', then `12' then
              `123' etc.  and comparing the result in each step.

            o the WML language is very complex because of the 9 independent languages which are used intermixed.
              Because of this WML is not easy to understand and use for the average webdesigner.

       <b>G06:</b> <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>documentation?</b>
            o Invoke the Documentation Browser by typing <u>wmd</u> and navigate through the installed documentation.

            o The WML Online documentation is located at

              &lt;https://thewml.github.io/&gt;

              The webpages are the same as the ones viewed with <u>wmd</u>.

       <b>G07:</b> <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>official</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>WML?</b>
            Yes, there is. First there is an official support mailing list for WML users:

              <a href="mailto:sw-wml@engelschall.com">sw-wml@engelschall.com</a>

            Here you can reach the WML author Ralf S. Engelschall, the current maintainer Denis Barbier, and the
            other people who use WML and which can help you in case of problems. Use this forum to  spread  your
            WML-related ideas and suggestion, too. Feel free to ask anything WML-related you want.

            To   subscribe   to   this   Majordomo-controlled   mailing   list,   just   send   an   E-mail   to
            <a href="mailto:majordomo@engelschall.com">majordomo@engelschall.com</a> with only

              subscribe sw-wml <a href="mailto:you@domain.dom">you@domain.dom</a>

            in the <u>body</u> (leave  the  subject  empty).  After  sending  this,  Majordomo  will  respond  with  an
            authentication  challenge  which  has  to send back again for security reasons (to avoid that others
            subscribe you without your ok). Now you are successfully subscribed to this list.

            Second you  can  directly  contact  Ralf  S.  Engelschall  &lt;<a href="mailto:rse@engelschall.com">rse@engelschall.com</a>&gt;  or  Denis  Barbier
            &lt;<a href="mailto:barbier@engelschall.com">barbier@engelschall.com</a>&gt; via E-mail in case of very important problems.

       <b>G08:</b> <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>bug</b> <b>report</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>author?</b>
            You have four options:

            Bug Reporting Tool WMb
                This  is  the  recommended  way  because  it  automatically  includes all parameters of your WML
                installation in the bug report which (most of the time) is essentially for the author to be able
                to successfully  solve  your  problem.   Just  run  the  <u>wmb</u>  program  and  enter  your  problem
                description. But make sure you have at least a workable E-mail link to the Internet, because WMb
                wants to send the bug report via E-mail to <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a> .

            Bug Reporting Webpage
                This is the general bug report webpage on

                &lt;https://github.com/thewml/website-meta-language/issues&gt;

                for all programs from Ralf S. Engelschall. Please include your `wml -V3' output, too.

            Mailing List
                This is the official support mailing list for WML which can be contacted via

                  <a href="mailto:sw-wml@engelschall.com">sw-wml@engelschall.com</a>

            Direct Contact
                This is the last chance, if all others failed. Just send your problem directly to the maintainer
                via <a href="mailto:barbier@engelschall.com">barbier@engelschall.com</a>

       <b>G09:</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>WML</b> <b>for</b> <b>textprocessing</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> <b>such</b> <b>powerful,</b> <b>isn't</b> <b>it?</b>
            Yes, WML is, but only for HTML generation.

            Although  WML  provides  a  lot of hot features (like Slicing or Diversion) one often also wants for
            textprocessing, WML is not a general textprocessing language.  WML is HTML-dependend  at  a  lot  of
            edges and it lacks features which a text-processor really needs (like paragraph formatting, footnote
            support,  etc).  And  even  if  you  really decide to use WML for writing other stuff than HTML, you
            should be as crazy as you have time. Because WML is slow compared with  any  general  textprocessing
            tool  like  TeX  or  even  SGML-Tools.  For  its target format HTML this was and is never a problem,
            because  the  largest  Webpage  is  never  greater  then  approximately  10-100  KB.  But  for  real
            textprocessing this size is peanuts.

            So,  please  don't  think  about  using  WML for text-processing, even if one of your primary target
            formats is HTML. Instead use a language like LaTeX2HTML, SDF or SGML-Tools to create the HTML format
            and <u>only</u> <u>post-process</u> this via WML. In other words: Use WML only for the dirty work of including the
            generated HTML stuff into your webpages. But don't think any longer  about  using  WML  as  a  text-
            processor.

   <b>QUESTIONS</b> <b>ABOUT</b> <b>PASSES</b>
       <b>P01:</b> <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>WML</b> <b>pass?</b>
            When  you are sure you don't need this particular pass, you can use WML option <b>-p</b> and just leave out
            the number of the pass.

       <b>P02:</b> <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>WML</b> <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>file?</b>
            Use the internal "&lt;protect&gt;" container tag which entirely protects its body from evaluation  by  any
            pass. To protect the body from evaluation by a particular pass only, you can use "&lt;protect pass=N&gt;".

       <b>P03:</b> <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>pass</b> <b>order?</b>
            Yes,  since WML 1.7.3, you may change it with the <b>-p</b> flag. But you are warned this should be used by
            WML gurus only and for very particular reasons. For some internal reasons,  processing  will  always
            stop  after  pass  9, even if you specify additional passes. This is a feature and is not subject to
            change on future releases.

       <b>P04:</b> <b>Why</b> <b>shall</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> <b>original</b> <b>pass</b> <b>order?</b>
            WML has been designed to use passes in numerical order. This feature has a strong influence  on  how
            WML  include  files  are  written  and there is no warranty these include files will still work when
            changing pass order.

   <b>QUESTIONS</b> <b>ABOUT</b> <b>INCLUDE</b> <b>FILES</b>
       <b>I01:</b> <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>install</b> <b>or</b> <b>activate</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>include</b> <b>files?</b>
            There are many ways, but the most elegant and useful way is the following: First create a  directory
            named <u>$HOME/.wml/</u> and then a directory named <u>$HOME/.wml/home/</u> via

              $ cd $HOME
              $ mkdir .wml
              $ mkdir .wml/home

            Then create a <u>$HOME/.wmlrc</u> file with at least the following contents:

              -I .wml
              -D HOME~.

            Now  just  install  your  private  include  file  <u>foo.tmpl</u>  as  <u>$HOME/.wml/home/foo.tmpl</u> and you are
            automatically be able to use it via

              #use tmpl::home::foo

            from within any WML source.

       <b>I02:</b> <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>overwrite</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>info-tag</b> <b>from</b> <b>wml::std:info?</b>
            Because the "&lt;info&gt;" tag constructs its information out of "WML_GEN_XXXX" variables which  theirself
            can  be  overwritten  by the <b>-D</b> option, you can just do this in your <u>$HOME/.wmlrc</u> file. For instance
            the authors <u>$HOME/.wmlrc</u> file contains the following three lines:

              -D WML_GEN_REALNAME="Ralf S. Engelschall"
              -D WML_GEN_USERNAME=rse
              -D WML_GEN_HOSTNAME=engelschall.com

            The most important one here is "WML_SRC_HOSTNAME" for the construction of the email address. Because
            WML cannot know the email domainname we really have to help it here.

       <b>I03:</b> <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>combine</b> <b>the</b> <b>gfont-</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>href-tag?</b>
            Just put the "&lt;gfont&gt;" tag directly into the "name" attribute of "&lt;href&gt;":

              &lt;href name="&lt;gfont&gt;The Hyperlink Text&lt;/gfont&gt;"
                    url="http://..."&gt;

       <b>I04:</b> <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>combine</b> <b>the</b> <b>gfont-</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rollover-tag?</b>
            Use "&lt;gfont&gt;"'s "notag" in combination with its "file" attribute as follows:

              &lt;gfont file=button-n.gif bgcolor="#ffffff" notag&gt;Text&lt;/gfont&gt;
              &lt;gfont file=button-o.gif bgcolor="#ccccff" notag&gt;Text&lt;/gfont&gt;
              &lt;rollover src=button-n.gif oversrc=button-o.gif url="http://..."&gt;

   <b>ERROR</b> <b>MESSAGES</b>
       <b>E01:</b> <b>Cannot</b> <b>load</b> <b>"/tmp/wml..."</b> <b>for</b> <b>unprotection</b>
            One pass did not produce any output. This message certainly indicates a WML's bug, and so should  be
            reported.

       <b>E02:</b> <b>ePerl:Error:</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>runtime</b> <b>error</b>
            An error occurred during pass 3 ("eperl"). The contents of the standard error channel is printed and
            may contain useful information for debugging.
