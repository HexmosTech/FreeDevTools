       shape_stdrul - shapeTools RMS general version selection rules

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  shape  release management system requires a set of standard version selection rules to be accessible
       project wide. These are defined in the <u>stdrules</u> file, which is to be included into the Shapefiles of  any
       part  of the system controlled by the shapeTools release management system. Version selection rules drive
       the binding of component names in the Shapefile to specific versions during a build  or  release  process
       (or  better:  any  process  performed  by  invocation  of  <a href="../man1/shape.1.html">shape</a>(1)  ). Some functions of shape_RMS allow
       definition of the version binding rule being active by defining the VERSIONS macro on the  command  line.
       This may be set to any of the rule names listed below.

       If  you  want  to  introduce  new  version  selection rules for project wide use, you may add them to the
       stdrules file. You should be very careful, when altering this file.  Do  not  remove  any  of  the  rules
       defined  in  the original version of stdrules (as it comes from the shapeTools distribution tape) because
       these are essential for the release management system. When altering one of the original selection rules,
       you should be very concious of what you are doing, as you may affect the operationality of shape RMS. For
       a description of the syntax of rule definitions, see the <a href="../man1/shape.1.html">shape</a>(1) manual.

       The standard version selection rules are:

       most_recent
                 For each component select a busy version if available, the most recent saved version otherwise.

       last_proposed
                 Use the last proposed version of each component. This rule fails, if  no  proposed  version  is
                 available

       last_released
                 Select versions from the last generated release.

       last_prereleased
                 Select versions from the last generated prerelease.

       recent_release
                 Select versions included in the last release or prerelease, whichever is newer.

       from_release
                 Select  versions  from a specific release or prerelease.  When using this rule the value of the
                 macro <u>RELEASENAME</u> has to be set to the name of the desired (pre)release.

       extern    Always select a busy version (a regular UNIX file). This rule should be applied to  all  extern
                 components that are not under control of the shapeTools version control system.
