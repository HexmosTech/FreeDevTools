       zfsprops — native and user-defined properties of ZFS datasets

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Properties are divided into two types, native properties and user-defined (or "user") properties.  Native
       properties either export internal statistics or control ZFS behavior.  In addition, native properties are
       either  editable  or  read-only.  User properties have no effect on ZFS behavior, but you can use them to
       annotate datasets in a way that is meaningful in your  environment.   For  more  information  about  user
       properties, see the “User Properties” section, below.

   <b>Native</b> <b>Properties</b>
       Every dataset has a set of properties that export statistics about the dataset as well as control various
       behaviors.   Properties  are  inherited  from the parent unless overridden by the child.  Some properties
       apply only to certain types of datasets (file systems, volumes, or snapshots).

       The values of numeric properties can be specified using human-readable suffixes (for example, <b>k</b>,  <b>KB</b>,  <b>M</b>,
       <b>Gb</b>, and so forth, up to <b>Z</b> for zettabyte).  The following are all valid (and equal) specifications: <b>1536M</b>,
       <b>1.5g</b>, <b>1.50GB</b>.

       The  values  of  non-numeric  properties are case sensitive and must be lowercase, except for <b>mountpoint</b>,
       <b>sharenfs</b>, and <b>sharesmb</b>.

       The following native properties consist of read-only statistics about the dataset.  These properties  can
       be neither set, nor inherited.  Native properties apply to all dataset types unless otherwise noted.

       <b>available</b>             The  amount  of  space available to the dataset and all its children, assuming that
                             there is no other activity in the pool.  Because space is  shared  within  a  pool,
                             availability can be limited by any number of factors, including physical pool size,
                             quotas, reservations, or other datasets within the pool.

                             This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>avail</b>.

       <b>compressratio</b>         For  non-snapshots,  the  compression  ratio  achieved  for  the <b>used</b> space of this
                             dataset,  expressed  as  a  multiplier.   The  <b>used</b>  property  includes  descendant
                             datasets,  and,  for  clones,  does  not  include  the space shared with the origin
                             snapshot.  For snapshots, the <b>compressratio</b> is the  same  as  the  <b>refcompressratio</b>
                             property.  Compression can be turned on by running: <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> <b>compression</b>=<b>on</b> <u>dataset</u>.
                             The default value is <b>off</b>.

       <b>createtxg</b>             The  transaction  group (txg) in which the dataset was created.  Bookmarks have the
                             same <b>createtxg</b> as the snapshot they  are  initially  tied  to.   This  property  is
                             suitable for ordering a list of snapshots, e.g. for incremental send and receive.

       <b>creation</b>              The time this dataset was created.

       <b>clones</b>                For  snapshots,  this  property is a comma-separated list of filesystems or volumes
                             which are clones of this snapshot.  The clones' <b>origin</b> property is  this  snapshot.
                             If  the <b>clones</b> property is not empty, then this snapshot can not be destroyed (even
                             with the <b>-r</b> or <b>-f</b> options).  The roles of  origin  and  clone  can  be  swapped  by
                             promoting the clone with the <b>zfs</b> <b>promote</b> command.

       <b>defer_destroy</b>         This  property  is <b>on</b> if the snapshot has been marked for deferred destroy by using
                             the <b>zfs</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>-d</b> command.  Otherwise, the property is <b>off</b>.

       <b>encryptionroot</b>        For encrypted datasets, indicates where the dataset  is  currently  inheriting  its
                             encryption  key  from.   Loading  or  unloading  a  key for the <b>encryptionroot</b> will
                             implicitly load / unload the key for any inheriting datasets (see <b>zfs</b> <b>load-key</b>  and
                             <b>zfs</b> <b>unload-key</b> for details).  Clones will always share an encryption key with their
                             origin.  See the “Encryption” section of <u><a href="../man8/zfs-load-key.8.html">zfs-load-key</a></u>(8) for details.

       <b>filesystem_count</b>      The  total  number of filesystems and volumes that exist under this location in the
                             dataset tree.  This value is only available when a <b>filesystem_limit</b>  has  been  set
                             somewhere in the tree under which the dataset resides.

       <b>keystatus</b>             Indicates  if  an encryption key is currently loaded into ZFS.  The possible values
                             are <b>none</b>, <b>available</b>, and <b>unavailable</b>.  See <b>zfs</b> <b>load-key</b> and <b>zfs</b> <b>unload-key</b>.

       <b>guid</b>                  The 64 bit GUID of this dataset or bookmark which does not change over  its  entire
                             lifetime.   When  a snapshot is sent to another pool, the received snapshot has the
                             same GUID.  Thus, the <b>guid</b> is suitable to identify a snapshot across pools.

       <b>logicalreferenced</b>     The amount of space that is  "logically"  accessible  by  this  dataset.   See  the
                             <b>referenced</b>  property.   The logical space ignores the effect of the <b>compression</b> and
                             <b>copies</b> properties, giving a quantity closer to the amount of data that applications
                             see.  However, it does include space consumed by metadata.

                             This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>lrefer</b>.

       <b>logicalused</b>           The amount of space that is "logically"  consumed  by  this  dataset  and  all  its
                             descendants.   See  the <b>used</b> property.  The logical space ignores the effect of the
                             <b>compression</b> and <b>copies</b> properties, giving a quantity closer to the amount  of  data
                             that applications see.  However, it does include space consumed by metadata.

                             This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>lused</b>.

       <b>mounted</b>               For  file  systems,  indicates  whether the file system is currently mounted.  This
                             property can be either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>.

       <b>objsetid</b>              A unique identifier for this dataset within the pool.  Unlike the  dataset's  <b>guid</b>,
                             the  <b>objsetid</b>  of  a dataset is not transferred to other pools when the snapshot is
                             copied with a send/receive operation.  The  <b>objsetid</b>  can  be  reused  (for  a  new
                             dataset) after the dataset is deleted.

       <b>origin</b>                For  cloned file systems or volumes, the snapshot from which the clone was created.
                             See also the <b>clones</b> property.

       <b>receive_resume_token</b>  For filesystems or volumes which have  saved  partially-completed  state  from  <b>zfs</b>
                             <b>receive</b> <b>-s</b>, this opaque token can be provided to <b>zfs</b> <b>send</b> <b>-t</b> to resume and complete
                             the <b>zfs</b> <b>receive</b>.

       <b>redact_snaps</b>          For bookmarks, this is the list of snapshot GUIDs the bookmark contains a redaction
                             list  for.   For  snapshots,  this  is  the  list of snapshot GUIDs the snapshot is
                             redacted with respect to.

       <b>referenced</b>            The amount of data that is accessible by this dataset, which  may  or  may  not  be
                             shared  with  other  datasets in the pool.  When a snapshot or clone is created, it
                             initially references the same amount of space as the file system or snapshot it was
                             created from, since its contents are identical.

                             This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>refer</b>.

       <b>refcompressratio</b>      The compression ratio achieved for the <b>referenced</b> space of this dataset,  expressed
                             as a multiplier.  See also the <b>compressratio</b> property.

       <b>snapshot_count</b>        The  total  number of snapshots that exist under this location in the dataset tree.
                             This value is only available when a <b>snapshot_limit</b> has been set  somewhere  in  the
                             tree under which the dataset resides.

       <b>type</b>                  The type of dataset: <b>filesystem</b>, <b>volume</b>, <b>snapshot</b>, or <b>bookmark</b>.

       <b>used</b>                  The  amount of space consumed by this dataset and all its descendants.  This is the
                             value that is checked against this dataset's quota and reservation.  The space used
                             does not include this  dataset's  reservation,  but  does  take  into  account  the
                             reservations  of  any  descendent  datasets.   The  amount  of space that a dataset
                             consumes from its parent, as well as the amount of space  that  is  freed  if  this
                             dataset  is  recursively  destroyed,  is  the  greater  of  its  space used and its
                             reservation.

                             The used space of a snapshot (see the “Snapshots”  section  of  <u><a href="../man7/zfsconcepts.7.html">zfsconcepts</a></u>(7))  is
                             space  that  is  referenced  exclusively  by  this  snapshot.   If this snapshot is
                             destroyed, the amount of <b>used</b> space  will  be  freed.   Space  that  is  shared  by
                             multiple  snapshots  isn't  accounted  for  in  this  metric.   When  a snapshot is
                             destroyed, space that was previously shared with this snapshot can become unique to
                             snapshots adjacent to it, thus changing the used space  of  those  snapshots.   The
                             used  space  of  the  latest  snapshot  can also be affected by changes in the file
                             system.  Note that the <b>used</b> space of a snapshot is a subset of the <b>written</b> space of
                             the snapshot.

                             The amount of space used, available, or  referenced  does  not  take  into  account
                             pending changes.  Pending changes are generally accounted for within a few seconds.
                             Committing  a  change  to  a  disk  using  <u><a href="../man2/fsync.2.html">fsync</a></u>(2)  or <b>O_SYNC</b> does not necessarily
                             guarantee that the space usage information is updated immediately.

       <b>usedby*</b>               The <b>usedby*</b> properties decompose the <b>used</b> properties into the various reasons  that
                             space   is   used.    Specifically,   <b>used</b>   =  <b>usedbychildren</b>  +  <b>usedbydataset</b>  +
                             <b>usedbyrefreservation</b> + <b>usedbysnapshots</b>.  These properties are  only  available  for
                             datasets created on <b>zpool</b> "version 13" pools.

       <b>usedbychildren</b>        The  amount  of space used by children of this dataset, which would be freed if all
                             the dataset's children were destroyed.

       <b>usedbydataset</b>         The amount of space used by this dataset  itself,  which  would  be  freed  if  the
                             dataset  were destroyed (after first removing any <b>refreservation</b> and destroying any
                             necessary snapshots or descendants).

       <b>usedbyrefreservation</b>  The amount of space used by a <b>refreservation</b> set on this dataset,  which  would  be
                             freed if the <b>refreservation</b> was removed.

       <b>usedbysnapshots</b>       The  amount  of  space consumed by snapshots of this dataset.  In particular, it is
                             the amount of space that would be freed if all of  this  dataset's  snapshots  were
                             destroyed.   Note that this is not simply the sum of the snapshots' <b>used</b> properties
                             because space can be shared by multiple snapshots.

       <b>userused</b>@<u>user</u>         The amount of space consumed by the specified  user  in  this  dataset.   Space  is
                             charged  to  the  owner  of  each file, as displayed by <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b>.  The amount of space
                             charged is displayed by <b>du</b> and <b>ls</b> <b>-s</b>.  See  the  <b>zfs</b>  <b>userspace</b>  command  for  more
                             information.

                             Unprivileged users can access only their own space usage.  The root user, or a user
                             who  has  been granted the <b>userused</b> privilege with <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b>, can access everyone's
                             usage.

                             The <b>userused</b>@<u>…</u> properties are not displayed by <b>zfs</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b>.  The user's  name  must
                             be appended after the <b>@</b> symbol, using one of the following forms:
                                 <b>•</b>   POSIX name ("joe")
                                 <b>•</b>   POSIX numeric ID ("789")
                                 <b>•</b>   SID name ("joe.smith@mydomain")
                                 <b>•</b>   SID numeric ID ("S-1-123-456-789")

                             Files created on Linux always have POSIX owners.

       <b>userobjused</b>@<u>user</u>      The <b>userobjused</b> property is similar to <b>userused</b> but instead it counts the number of
                             objects  consumed  by a user.  This property counts all objects allocated on behalf
                             of the user, it may differ from the results of system tools such as <b>df</b> <b>-i</b>.

                             When the property <b>xattr</b>=<b>on</b> is set on a  file  system  additional  objects  will  be
                             created  per-file  to  store  extended  attributes.   These  additional objects are
                             reflected in the <b>userobjused</b> value and are counted against the user's <b>userobjquota</b>.
                             When a file system is configured to use <b>xattr</b>=<b>sa</b> no additional internal objects are
                             normally required.

       <b>userrefs</b>              This property is set to the number of user holds on this snapshot.  User holds  are
                             set by using the <b>zfs</b> <b>hold</b> command.

       <b>groupused</b>@<u>group</u>       The  amount  of  space  consumed  by the specified group in this dataset.  Space is
                             charged to the group of each file, as displayed by <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b>.   See  the  <b>userused</b>@<u>user</u>
                             property for more information.

                             Unprivileged  users  can only access their own groups' space usage.  The root user,
                             or a user who has been granted the <b>groupused</b> privilege with <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b>,  can  access
                             all groups' usage.

       <b>groupobjused</b>@<u>group</u>    The  number  of  objects consumed by the specified group in this dataset.  Multiple
                             objects may be charged to the group for each file when extended attributes  are  in
                             use.  See the <b>userobjused</b>@<u>user</u> property for more information.

                             Unprivileged  users  can only access their own groups' space usage.  The root user,
                             or a user who has been granted the  <b>groupobjused</b>  privilege  with  <b>zfs</b>  <b>allow</b>,  can
                             access all groups' usage.

       <b>projectused</b>@<u>project</u>   The  amount of space consumed by the specified project in this dataset.  Project is
                             identified via the project identifier (ID) that is object-based numeral  attribute.
                             An  object can inherit the project ID from its parent object (if the parent has the
                             flag of inherit project ID that can be set and  changed  via  <b>chattr</b>  <b>-/+P</b>  or  <b>zfs</b>
                             <b>project</b>  <b>-s</b>)  when  being created.  The privileged user can set and change object's
                             project ID via <b>chattr</b> <b>-p</b> or <b>zfs</b> <b>project</b>  <b>-s</b>  anytime.   Space  is  charged  to  the
                             project  of  each  file,  as  displayed  by  <b>lsattr</b>  <b>-p</b>  or  <b>zfs</b>  <b>project</b>.  See the
                             <b>userused</b>@<u>user</u> property for more information.

                             The root user, or a user who has been granted the <b>projectused</b>  privilege  with  <b>zfs</b>
                             <b>allow</b>, can access all projects' usage.

       <b>projectobjused</b>@<u>project</u>
                             The  <b>projectobjused</b>  is  similar to <b>projectused</b> but instead it counts the number of
                             objects consumed by project.  When the property <b>xattr</b>=<b>on</b> is set on a  fileset,  ZFS
                             will  create  additional  objects  per-file  to  store  extended attributes.  These
                             additional objects are reflected  in  the  <b>projectobjused</b>  value  and  are  counted
                             against  the  project's  <b>projectobjquota</b>.   When  a filesystem is configured to use
                             <b>xattr</b>=<b>sa</b> no additional internal objects are  required.   See  the  <b>userobjused</b>@<u>user</u>
                             property for more information.

                             The root user, or a user who has been granted the <b>projectobjused</b> privilege with <b>zfs</b>
                             <b>allow</b>, can access all projects' objects usage.

       <b>snapshots_changed</b>     Provides a mechanism to quickly determine whether snapshot list has changed without
                             having  to  mount  a  dataset  or iterate the snapshot list.  Specifies the time at
                             which a snapshot for a dataset was last created or deleted.

                             This allows us to be more efficient how often we query snapshots.  The property  is
                             persistent  across  mount  and  unmount  operations  only if the <b>extensible_dataset</b>
                             feature is enabled.

       <b>volblocksize</b>          For volumes, specifies the block size of  the  volume.   The  <b>blocksize</b>  cannot  be
                             changed  once  the  volume has been written, so it should be set at volume creation
                             time.  The default <b>blocksize</b> for volumes is 16 KiB.  Any power of 2 from 512  bytes
                             to 128 KiB is valid.

                             This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>volblock</b>.

       <b>written</b>               The amount of space <b>referenced</b> by this dataset, that was written since the previous
                             snapshot (i.e. that is not referenced by the previous snapshot).

       <b>written</b>@<u>snapshot</u>      The  amount  of  <b>referenced</b>  space  written  to  this  dataset  since the specified
                             snapshot.  This is the space that  is  referenced  by  this  dataset  but  was  not
                             referenced by the specified snapshot.

                             The <u>snapshot</u> may be specified as a short snapshot name (just the part after the <b>@</b>),
                             in  which  case it will be interpreted as a snapshot in the same filesystem as this
                             dataset.  The <u>snapshot</u> may be a full snapshot name (<u>filesystem</u>@<u>snapshot</u>), which for
                             clones may be a snapshot in the origin's filesystem (or the origin of the  origin's
                             filesystem, etc.)

       The following native properties can be used to change the behavior of a ZFS dataset.

       <b>aclinherit</b>=<b>discard</b>|<b>noallow</b>|<b>restricted</b>|<b>passthrough</b>|<b>passthrough-x</b>
         Controls how ACEs are inherited when files and directories are created.
             <b>discard</b>        does not inherit any ACEs.
             <b>noallow</b>        only inherits inheritable ACEs that specify "deny" permissions.
             <b>restricted</b>     default,  removes  the  <b>write_acl</b>  and  <b>write_owner</b>  permissions  when  the  ACE  is
                            inherited.
             <b>passthrough</b>    inherits all inheritable ACEs without any modifications.
             <b>passthrough-x</b>  same meaning as <b>passthrough</b>, except that the  <b>owner@</b>,  <b>group@</b>,  and  <b>everyone@</b>  ACEs
                            inherit  the  execute  permission  only  if the file creation mode also requests the
                            execute bit.

         When the property value is set to <b>passthrough</b>,  files  are  created  with  a  mode  determined  by  the
         inheritable  ACEs.   If  no  inheritable  ACEs  exist  that  affect  the  mode, then the mode is set in
         accordance to the requested mode from the application.

         The <b>aclinherit</b> property does not apply to POSIX ACLs.

       <b>aclmode</b>=<b>discard</b>|<b>groupmask</b>|<b>passthrough</b>|<b>restricted</b>
         Controls how an ACL is modified during <a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</a>(2) and  how  inherited  ACEs  are  modified  by  the  file
         creation mode:
             <b>discard</b>      default,  deletes  all  <b>ACEs</b>  except  for  those  representing the mode of the file or
                          directory requested by <u><a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</a></u>(2).
             <b>groupmask</b>    reduces permissions granted in all <b>ALLOW</b> entries found in the <b>ACL</b> such that  they  are
                          no greater than the group permissions specified by <u><a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</a></u>(2).
             <b>passthrough</b>  indicates  that  no  changes  are  made to the ACL other than creating or updating the
                          necessary ACL entries to represent the new mode of the file or directory.
             <b>restricted</b>   will cause the <u><a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</a></u>(2) operation to  return  an  error  when  used  on  any  file  or
                          directory  which has a non-trivial ACL whose entries can not be represented by a mode.
                          <u><a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</a></u>(2) is required to change the set user ID, set group ID, or sticky bits on a file
                          or directory, as they do not have equivalent ACL entries.  In order to use <u><a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</a></u>(2) on
                          a file or directory with a non-trivial ACL when <b>aclmode</b> is set to <b>restricted</b>, you must
                          first remove all ACL entries which do not represent the current mode.

       <b>acltype</b>=<b>off</b>|<b>nfsv4</b>|<b>posix</b>
         Controls whether ACLs are enabled and if so what type of ACL to use.  When this property is  set  to  a
         type of ACL not supported by the current platform, the behavior is the same as if it were set to <b>off</b>.
             <b>off</b>       default  on  Linux,  when a file system has the <b>acltype</b> property set to off then ACLs are
                       disabled.
             <b>noacl</b>     an alias for <b>off</b>
             <b>nfsv4</b>     default on FreeBSD, indicates that NFSv4-style ZFS ACLs should be used.  These  ACLs  can
                       be  managed  with  the  <u><a href="../man1/getfacl.1.html">getfacl</a></u>(1)  and  <u><a href="../man1/setfacl.1.html">setfacl</a></u>(1).   The  <b>nfsv4</b> ZFS ACL type is not yet
                       supported on Linux.
             <b>posix</b>     indicates POSIX ACLs should be used.  POSIX ACLs  are  specific  to  Linux  and  are  not
                       functional  on  other  platforms.   POSIX  ACLs  are  stored as an extended attribute and
                       therefore will not overwrite any existing NFSv4 ACLs which may be set.
             <b>posixacl</b>  an alias for <b>posix</b>

         To obtain the best performance when setting <b>posix</b> users are strongly encouraged  to  set  the  <b>xattr</b>=<b>sa</b>
         property.   This  will  result  in  the  POSIX  ACL  being  stored  more efficiently on disk.  But as a
         consequence, all new extended attributes will only be accessible  from  OpenZFS  implementations  which
         support the <b>xattr</b>=<b>sa</b> property.  See the <b>xattr</b> property for more details.

       <b>atime</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>
         Controls  whether  the  access time for files is updated when they are read.  Turning this property off
         avoids producing write traffic when reading files and can  result  in  significant  performance  gains,
         though  it  might confuse mailers and other similar utilities.  The values <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> are equivalent to
         the <b>atime</b> and <b>noatime</b> mount options.  The default value is <b>on</b>.  See also <b>relatime</b> below.

       <b>canmount</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>|<b>noauto</b>
         If this property is set to <b>off</b>, the file system cannot be mounted, and is  ignored  by  <b>zfs</b>  <b>mount</b>  <b>-a</b>.
         Setting  this  property  to  <b>off</b> is similar to setting the <b>mountpoint</b> property to <b>none</b>, except that the
         dataset still has a normal <b>mountpoint</b> property, which can be inherited.  Setting this property  to  <b>off</b>
         allows  datasets  to  be  used  solely  as  a  mechanism to inherit properties.  One example of setting
         <b>canmount</b>=<b>off</b> is to have two datasets with the same <b>mountpoint</b>, so that the children  of  both  datasets
         appear in the same directory, but might have different inherited characteristics.

         When set to <b>noauto</b>, a dataset can only be mounted and unmounted explicitly.  The dataset is not mounted
         automatically when the dataset is created or imported, nor is it mounted by the <b>zfs</b> <b>mount</b> <b>-a</b> command or
         unmounted by the <b>zfs</b> <b>unmount</b> <b>-a</b> command.

         This property is not inherited.

       <b>checksum</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>|<b>fletcher2</b>|<b>fletcher4</b>|<b>sha256</b>|<b>noparity</b>|<b>sha512</b>|<b>skein</b>|<b>edonr</b>|<b>blake3</b>
         Controls  the  checksum  used  to  verify data integrity.  The default value is <b>on</b>, which automatically
         selects an appropriate algorithm (currently, <b>fletcher4</b>, but this may change in future  releases).   The
         value <b>off</b> disables integrity checking on user data.  The value <b>noparity</b> not only disables integrity but
         also  disables  maintaining  parity  for  user  data.  This setting is used internally by a dump device
         residing on a RAID-Z pool and should not be used by any other dataset.  Disabling checksums  is  <u>NOT</u>  a
         recommended practice.

         The  <b>sha512</b>,  <b>skein</b>, <b>edonr</b>, and <b>blake3</b> checksum algorithms require enabling the appropriate features on
         the pool.

         Please see <u><a href="../man7/zpool-features.7.html">zpool-features</a></u>(7) for more information on these algorithms.

         Changing this property affects only newly-written data.

       <b>compression</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>|<b>gzip</b>|<b>gzip-</b><u>N</u>|<b>lz4</b>|<b>lzjb</b>|<b>zle</b>|<b>zstd</b>|<b>zstd-</b><u>N</u>|<b>zstd-fast</b>|<b>zstd-fast-</b><u>N</u>
         Controls the compression algorithm used for this dataset.

         When set to <b>on</b> (the default), indicates that the current default compression algorithm should be  used.
         The  default  balances  compression  and decompression speed, with compression ratio and is expected to
         work well on a wide variety of workloads.  Unlike all other settings for this  property,  <b>on</b>  does  not
         select a fixed compression type.  As new compression algorithms are added to ZFS and enabled on a pool,
         the default compression algorithm may change.  The current default compression algorithm is either <b>lzjb</b>
         or, if the <b>lz4_compress</b> feature is enabled, <b>lz4</b>.

         The  <b>lz4</b>  compression  algorithm is a high-performance replacement for the <b>lzjb</b> algorithm.  It features
         significantly faster compression and decompression, as well as a moderately  higher  compression  ratio
         than  <b>lzjb</b>,  but  can  only  be  used  on  pools  with  the  <b>lz4_compress</b>  feature set to <b>enabled</b>.  See
         <u><a href="../man7/zpool-features.7.html">zpool-features</a></u>(7) for details on ZFS feature flags and the <b>lz4_compress</b> feature.

         The <b>lzjb</b> compression algorithm is optimized for performance while providing decent data compression.

         The <b>gzip</b> compression algorithm uses the same compression as the <u><a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a></u>(1) command.  You can  specify  the
         <b>gzip</b>  level  by  using  the value <b>gzip-</b><u>N</u>, where <u>N</u> is an integer from 1 (fastest) to 9 (best compression
         ratio).  Currently, <b>gzip</b> is equivalent to <b>gzip-6</b> (which is also the default for <u><a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a></u>(1)).

         The <b>zstd</b> compression algorithm provides both high compression ratios and  good  performance.   You  can
         specify  the  <b>zstd</b>  level by using the value <b>zstd-</b><u>N</u>, where <u>N</u> is an integer from 1 (fastest) to 19 (best
         compression ratio).  <b>zstd</b> is equivalent to <b>zstd-3</b>.

         Faster speeds at the cost of the compression ratio can be requested by setting a negative  <b>zstd</b>  level.
         This  is  done using <b>zstd-fast-</b><u>N</u>, where <u>N</u> is an integer in [<b>1</b>-<b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, …, <b>100</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>1000</b>] which maps
         to a negative <b>zstd</b> level.  The lower the level the faster the compression — <b>1000</b> provides  the  fastest
         compression and lowest compression ratio.  <b>zstd-fast</b> is equivalent to <b>zstd-fast-</b><u>1</u>.

         The <b>zle</b> compression algorithm compresses runs of zeros.

         This  property  can  also be referred to by its shortened column name <b>compress</b>.  Changing this property
         affects only newly-written data.

         When any setting except <b>off</b> is selected, compression will explicitly check  for  blocks  consisting  of
         only  zeroes  (the  NUL  byte).   When  a zero-filled block is detected, it is stored as a hole and not
         compressed using the indicated compression algorithm.

         All blocks are allocated as a whole number of sectors (chunks of 2^<b>ashift</b> bytes,  e.g.  <b>512B</b>  or  <b>4KB</b>).
         Compression  may  result  in  a  non-sector-aligned size, which will be rounded up to a whole number of
         sectors.  If compression saves less than one whole sector,  the  block  will  be  stored  uncompressed.
         Therefore,  blocks  whose  logical  size  is a small number of sectors will experience less compression
         (e.g. for <b>recordsize</b>=<b>16K</b> with <b>4K</b> sectors, which have 4 sectors per block, compression needs to save  at
         least 25% to actually save space on disk).

         There is <b>12.5%</b> default compression threshold in addition to sector rounding.

       <b>context</b>=<b>none</b>|<u>SELinux-User</u>:<u>SELinux-Role</u>:<u>SELinux-Type</u>:<u>Sensitivity-Level</u>
         This  flag  sets the SELinux context for all files in the file system under a mount point for that file
         system.  See <u><a href="../man8/selinux.8.html">selinux</a></u>(8) for more information.

       <b>fscontext</b>=<b>none</b>|<u>SELinux-User</u>:<u>SELinux-Role</u>:<u>SELinux-Type</u>:<u>Sensitivity-Level</u>
         This flag sets the SELinux context for the file system file system being mounted.  See  <u><a href="../man8/selinux.8.html">selinux</a></u>(8)  for
         more information.

       <b>defcontext</b>=<b>none</b>|<u>SELinux-User</u>:<u>SELinux-Role</u>:<u>SELinux-Type</u>:<u>Sensitivity-Level</u>
         This flag sets the SELinux default context for unlabeled files.  See <u><a href="../man8/selinux.8.html">selinux</a></u>(8) for more information.

       <b>rootcontext</b>=<b>none</b>|<u>SELinux-User</u>:<u>SELinux-Role</u>:<u>SELinux-Type</u>:<u>Sensitivity-Level</u>
         This  flag  sets  the  SELinux  context for the root inode of the file system.  See <u><a href="../man8/selinux.8.html">selinux</a></u>(8) for more
         information.

       <b>copies</b>=<b>1</b>|<b>2</b>|<b>3</b>
         Controls the number of copies of data stored for this dataset.  These copies are  in  addition  to  any
         redundancy  provided by the pool, for example, mirroring or RAID-Z.  The copies are stored on different
         disks, if possible.  The space used by multiple copies is charged to the associated file  and  dataset,
         changing the <b>used</b> property and counting against quotas and reservations.

         Changing  this  property  only affects newly-written data.  Therefore, set this property at file system
         creation time by using the <b>-o</b> <b>copies</b>=<u>N</u> option.

         Remember that ZFS will not import a pool with a missing top-level vdev.  Do <u>NOT</u> create, for  example  a
         two-disk  striped  pool  and set <b>copies</b>=<u>2</u> on some datasets thinking you have setup redundancy for them.
         When a disk fails you will not be able to import the pool and will have lost all of your data.

         Encrypted datasets may not have <b>copies</b>=<u>3</u> since the implementation stores some encryption metadata where
         the third copy would normally be.

       <b>devices</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>
         Controls whether device nodes can be opened on this file system.  The default value is <b>on</b>.  The  values
         <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> are equivalent to the <b>dev</b> and <b>nodev</b> mount options.

       <b>dedup</b>=<b>off</b>|<b>on</b>|<b>verify</b>|<b>sha256</b>[,<b>verify</b>]|<b>sha512</b>[,<b>verify</b>]|<b>skein</b>[,<b>verify</b>]|<b>edonr</b>,<b>verify</b>|<b>blake3</b>[,<b>verify</b>]
         Configures  deduplication for a dataset.  The default value is <b>off</b>.  The default deduplication checksum
         is <b>sha256</b> (this may change in the future).  When <b>dedup</b> is enabled, the checksum defined here  overrides
         the <b>checksum</b> property.  Setting the value to <b>verify</b> has the same effect as the setting <b>sha256</b>,<b>verify</b>.

         If set to <b>verify</b>, ZFS will do a byte-to-byte comparison in case of two blocks having the same signature
         to make sure the block contents are identical.  Specifying <b>verify</b> is mandatory for the <b>edonr</b> algorithm.

         Unless  necessary, deduplication should <u>not</u> be enabled on a system.  See the “Deduplication” section of
         <u><a href="../man7/zfsconcepts.7.html">zfsconcepts</a></u>(7).

       <b>direct</b>=<b>disabled</b>|<b>standard</b>|<b>always</b>
         Controls the behavior of Direct I/O requests (e.g. O_DIRECT).  The <b>standard</b>  behavior  for  Direct  I/O
         requests is to bypass the ARC when possible.  These requests will not be cached and performance will be
         limited  by  the raw speed of the underlying disks (this is the default).  <b>always</b> causes every properly
         aligned read or write to be treated as a direct request.  <b>disabled</b>  causes  the  O_DIRECT  flag  to  be
         silently  ignored and all direct requests will be handled by the ARC.  This is the default behavior for
         OpenZFS 2.2 and prior releases.

         Bypassing the ARC requires that a direct request be correctly aligned.  For write requests the starting
         offset and size of the request must be <b>recordsize</b>-aligned, if not then the  unaligned  portion  of  the
         request  will  be  silently  redirected  through  the  ARC.   For  read requests there is no <b>recordsize</b>
         alignment restriction on either the starting offset or size.  All direct  requests  must  use  a  page-
         aligned memory buffer and the request size must be a multiple of the page size or an error is returned.

         Concurrently  mixing  buffered  and  direct  requests  to  overlapping  regions  of a file can decrease
         performance.  However, the resulting file will always be coherent.  For example, a direct read after  a
         buffered  write  will  return  the  data  from the buffered write.  Furthermore, if an application uses
         <u><a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a></u>(2) based file access then in order to maintain coherency all  direct  requests  are  converted  to
         buffered  requests  while  the  file  is mapped.  Currently Direct I/O is not supported with zvols.  If
         dedup is enabled on a dataset, Direct I/O writes will not check for deduplication.   Deduplication  and
         Direct I/O writes are currently incompatible.

       <b>dnodesize</b>=<b>legacy</b>|<b>auto</b>|<b>1k</b>|<b>2k</b>|<b>4k</b>|<b>8k</b>|<b>16k</b>
         Specifies a compatibility mode or literal value for the size of dnodes in the file system.  The default
         value  is  <b>legacy</b>.   Setting  this  property to a value other than <b>legacy</b> requires the <b>large_dnode</b> pool
         feature to be enabled.

         Consider setting <b>dnodesize</b> to <b>auto</b> if the dataset uses the <b>xattr</b>=<b>sa</b> property setting and  the  workload
         makes  heavy  use  of  extended  attributes.  This may be applicable to SELinux-enabled systems, Lustre
         servers, and Samba servers, for example.  Literal values are supported for cases where the optimal size
         is known in advance and for performance testing.

         Leave <b>dnodesize</b> set to <b>legacy</b> if you need to receive a send stream of  this  dataset  on  a  pool  that
         doesn't  enable  the  <b>large_dnode</b>  feature, or if you need to import this pool on a system that doesn't
         support the <b>large_dnode</b> feature.

         This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>dnsize</b>.

       <b>encryption</b>=<b>off</b>|<b>on</b>|<b>aes-128-ccm</b>|<b>aes-192-ccm</b>|<b>aes-256-ccm</b>|<b>aes-128-gcm</b>|<b>aes-192-gcm</b>|<b>aes-256-gcm</b>
         Controls the encryption cipher suite (block cipher, key  length,  and  mode)  used  for  this  dataset.
         Requires  the  <b>encryption</b> feature to be enabled on the pool.  Requires a <b>keyformat</b> to be set at dataset
         creation time.

         Selecting <b>encryption</b>=<b>on</b> when creating a dataset indicates that the default  encryption  suite  will  be
         selected,  which  is currently <b>aes-256-gcm</b>.  In order to provide consistent data protection, encryption
         must be specified at dataset creation time and it cannot be changed afterwards.

         For more details and caveats about encryption see the “Encryption” section of <u><a href="../man8/zfs-load-key.8.html">zfs-load-key</a></u>(8).

       <b>keyformat</b>=<b>raw</b>|<b>hex</b>|<b>passphrase</b>
         Controls what format the user's encryption key will be provided as.  This property is only set when the
         dataset is encrypted.

         Raw keys and hex keys must be 32 bytes long (regardless of the chosen encryption  suite)  and  must  be
         randomly generated.  A raw key can be generated with the following command:
               <b>#</b> <b>dd</b> <b>if=/dev/urandom</b> <b>bs=32</b> <b>count=1</b> <b>of=</b><u>/path/to/output/key</u>

         Passphrases must be between 8 and 512 bytes long and will be processed through PBKDF2 before being used
         (see  the  <b>pbkdf2iters</b>  property).   Even  though  the encryption suite cannot be changed after dataset
         creation, the keyformat can be with <b>zfs</b> <b>change-key</b>.

       <b>keylocation</b>=<b>prompt</b>|<b>file://</b><u>/absolute/file/path</u>|<b>https://</b><u>address</u>|<b>http://</b><u>address</u>
         Controls where the user's encryption key will be loaded from  by  default  for  commands  such  as  <b>zfs</b>
         <b>load-key</b>  and  <b>zfs</b>  <b>mount</b>  <b>-l</b>.   This  property is only set for encrypted datasets which are encryption
         roots.  If unspecified, the default is <b>prompt</b>.

         Even though the encryption suite cannot be changed after dataset creation, the keylocation can be  with
         either <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> or <b>zfs</b> <b>change-key</b>.  If <b>prompt</b> is selected ZFS will ask for the key at the command prompt
         when  it  is  required  to access the encrypted data (see <b>zfs</b> <b>load-key</b> for details).  This setting will
         also allow the key to be passed in via the standard input stream, but users should be  careful  not  to
         place keys which should be kept secret on the command line.  If a file URI is selected, the key will be
         loaded  from  the specified absolute file path.  If an HTTPS or HTTP URL is selected, it will be GETted
         using <u><a href="../man3/fetch.3.html">fetch</a></u>(3), libcurl, or nothing, depending on compile-time configuration and run-time availability.
         The <b>SSL_CA_CERT_FILE</b> environment  variable  can  be  set  to  set  the  location  of  the  concatenated
         certificate  store.   The  <b>SSL_CA_CERT_PATH</b> environment variable can be set to override the location of
         the  directory  containing  the   certificate   authority   bundle.    The   <b>SSL_CLIENT_CERT_FILE</b>   and
         <b>SSL_CLIENT_KEY_FILE</b>  environment  variables  can be set to configure the path to the client certificate
         and its key.

       <b>pbkdf2iters</b>=<u>iterations</u>
         Controls the number of PBKDF2 iterations that a <b>passphrase</b> encryption key should be  run  through  when
         processing  it  into an encryption key.  This property is only defined when encryption is enabled and a
         keyformat of <b>passphrase</b> is selected.  The goal of PBKDF2 is to significantly increase the computational
         difficulty needed to brute force a user's passphrase.  This is accomplished by forcing the attacker  to
         run  each passphrase through a computationally expensive hashing function many times before they arrive
         at the resulting key.  A user who actually knows the passphrase will only have to pay this  cost  once.
         As  CPUs  become better at processing, this number should be raised to ensure that a brute force attack
         is still not possible.  The current default is <b>350000</b> and the minimum is <b>100000</b>.  This property may  be
         changed with <b>zfs</b> <b>change-key</b>.

       <b>exec</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>
         Controls whether processes can be executed from within this file system.  The default value is <b>on</b>.  The
         values <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> are equivalent to the <b>exec</b> and <b>noexec</b> mount options.

       <b>volthreading</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>
         Controls  internal  zvol  threading.   The  value  <b>off</b>  disables  zvol  threading,  and  zvol relies on
         application threads.  The default value is <b>on</b>, which enables threading within a zvol.  Please note that
         this property will be  overridden  by  <b>zvol_request_sync</b>  module  parameter.   This  property  is  only
         applicable to Linux.

       <b>filesystem_limit</b>=<u>count</u>|<b>none</b>
         Limits  the number of filesystems and volumes that can exist under this point in the dataset tree.  The
         limit is not enforced if the user is allowed to change the limit.  Setting a <b>filesystem_limit</b> to  <b>on</b>  a
         descendant  of  a  filesystem  that  already  has  a  <b>filesystem_limit</b> does not override the ancestor's
         <b>filesystem_limit</b>, but rather imposes an additional limit.  This feature must be enabled to be used (see
         <u><a href="../man7/zpool-features.7.html">zpool-features</a></u>(7)).

       <b>special_small_blocks</b>=<u>size</u>
         This value represents the threshold block size  for  including  small  file  blocks  into  the  special
         allocation  class.   Blocks  smaller  than  or  equal  to  this  value  will be assigned to the special
         allocation class while greater blocks will be assigned to the regular class.  Valid values are zero  or
         a  power of two from 512 up to 1048576 (1 MiB).  The default size is 0 which means no small file blocks
         will be allocated in the special class.

         Before setting this property, a special class vdev must be added to the pool.  See <u><a href="../man7/zpoolconcepts.7.html">zpoolconcepts</a></u>(7) for
         more details on the special allocation class.

       <b>mountpoint</b>=<u>path</u>|<b>none</b>|<b>legacy</b>
         Controls the mount point used for this file system.  See the “Mount Points” section  of  <u><a href="../man7/zfsconcepts.7.html">zfsconcepts</a></u>(7)
         for more information on how this property is used.

         When  the  <b>mountpoint</b>  property  is  changed  for  a file system, the file system and any children that
         inherit the mount point are unmounted.  If the  new  value  is  <b>legacy</b>,  then  they  remain  unmounted.
         Otherwise,  they  are automatically remounted in the new location if the property was previously <b>legacy</b>
         or <b>none</b>.  In addition, any shared file systems are unshared and shared in the new location.

         When the <b>mountpoint</b> property is set with <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> <b>-u</b> , the <b>mountpoint</b> property is updated but dataset is
         not mounted or unmounted and remains as it was before.

       <b>nbmand</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>
         Controls whether the file system should be mounted with <b>nbmand</b> (Non-blocking mandatory locks).  Changes
         to this property only take effect when the file system is  unmounted  and  remounted.   This  was  only
         supported  by  Linux  prior  to 5.15, and was buggy there, and is not supported by FreeBSD.  On Solaris
         it's used for SMB clients.

       <b>overlay</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>
         Allow mounting on a busy directory or a directory which already contains files or directories.  This is
         the default mount behavior for Linux and FreeBSD file systems.  On these platforms the property  is  <b>on</b>
         by default.  Set to <b>off</b> to disable overlay mounts for consistency with OpenZFS on other platforms.

       <b>primarycache</b>=<b>all</b>|<b>none</b>|<b>metadata</b>
         Controls  what  is  cached  in the primary cache (ARC).  If this property is set to <b>all</b>, then both user
         data and metadata is cached.  If this property is set to <b>none</b>, then neither user data nor  metadata  is
         cached.  If this property is set to <b>metadata</b>, then only metadata is cached.  The default value is <b>all</b>.

       <b>quota</b>=<u>size</u>|<b>none</b>
         Limits  the  amount  of space a dataset and its descendants can consume.  This property enforces a hard
         limit on the amount of space used.  This includes all space consumed  by  descendants,  including  file
         systems  and snapshots.  Setting a quota on a descendant of a dataset that already has a quota does not
         override the ancestor's quota, but rather imposes an additional limit.

         Quotas cannot be set on volumes, as the <b>volsize</b> property acts as an implicit quota.

       <b>snapshot_limit</b>=<u>count</u>|<b>none</b>
         Limits the number of snapshots that can be created  on  a  dataset  and  its  descendants.   Setting  a
         <b>snapshot_limit</b>  on  a  descendant  of a dataset that already has a <b>snapshot_limit</b> does not override the
         ancestor's <b>snapshot_limit</b>, but rather imposes an additional limit.  The limit is not  enforced  if  the
         user  is  allowed to change the limit.  For example, this means that recursive snapshots taken from the
         global zone are counted against each delegated dataset within a zone.  This feature must be enabled  to
         be used (see <u><a href="../man7/zpool-features.7.html">zpool-features</a></u>(7)).

       <b>userquota@</b><u>user</u>=<u>size</u>|<b>none</b>
         Limits the amount of space consumed by the specified user.  User space consumption is identified by the
         <b>userspace@</b><u>user</u> property.

         Enforcement  of  user  quotas  may  be  delayed by several seconds.  This delay means that a user might
         exceed their quota before the system notices that they are over quota and begins to  refuse  additional
         writes with the EDQUOT error message.  See the <b>zfs</b> <b>userspace</b> command for more information.

         Unprivileged  users  can  only  access their own groups' space usage.  The root user, or a user who has
         been granted the <b>userquota</b> privilege with <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b>, can get and set everyone's quota.

         This property is not available on volumes, on file systems before version 4, or on pools before version
         15.  The <b>userquota@</b><u>…</u> properties are not displayed by <b>zfs</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b>.  The user's  name  must  be  appended
         after the <b>@</b> symbol, using one of the following forms:
             <b>•</b>   POSIX name ("joe")
             <b>•</b>   POSIX numeric ID ("789")
             <b>•</b>   SID name ("joe.smith@mydomain")
             <b>•</b>   SID numeric ID ("S-1-123-456-789")

         Files created on Linux always have POSIX owners.

       <b>userobjquota@</b><u>user</u>=<u>size</u>|<b>none</b>
         The <b>userobjquota</b> is similar to <b>userquota</b> but it limits the number of objects a user can create.  Please
         refer to <b>userobjused</b> for more information about how objects are counted.

       <b>groupquota@</b><u>group</u>=<u>size</u>|<b>none</b>
         Limits  the  amount of space consumed by the specified group.  Group space consumption is identified by
         the <b>groupused@</b><u>group</u> property.

         Unprivileged users can access only their own groups' space usage.  The root user, or  a  user  who  has
         been granted the <b>groupquota</b> privilege with <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b>, can get and set all groups' quotas.

       <b>groupobjquota@</b><u>group</u>=<u>size</u>|<b>none</b>
         The <b>groupobjquota</b> is similar to <b>groupquota</b> but it limits number of objects a group can consume.  Please
         refer to <b>userobjused</b> for more information about how objects are counted.

       <b>projectquota@</b><u>project</u>=<u>size</u>|<b>none</b>
         Limits  the amount of space consumed by the specified project.  Project space consumption is identified
         by the <b>projectused@</b><u>project</u> property.  Please refer  to  <b>projectused</b>  for  more  information  about  how
         project is identified and set/changed.

         The root user, or a user who has been granted the <b>projectquota</b> privilege with <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b>, can access all
         projects' quota.

       <b>projectobjquota@</b><u>project</u>=<u>size</u>|<b>none</b>
         The  <b>projectobjquota</b>  is similar to <b>projectquota</b> but it limits number of objects a project can consume.
         Please refer to <b>userobjused</b> for more information about how objects are counted.

       <b>readonly</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>
         Controls whether this dataset can be modified.  The default value is <b>off</b>.  The values <b>on</b>  and  <b>off</b>  are
         equivalent to the <b>ro</b> and <b>rw</b> mount options.

         This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>rdonly</b>.

       <b>recordsize</b>=<u>size</u>
         Specifies  a  suggested  block size for files in the file system.  This property is designed solely for
         use with database workloads that access files in fixed-size records.   ZFS  automatically  tunes  block
         sizes according to internal algorithms optimized for typical access patterns.

         For databases that create very large files but access them in small random chunks, these algorithms may
         be  suboptimal.   Specifying  a <b>recordsize</b> greater than or equal to the record size of the database can
         result in significant performance gains.  Use of this property for  general  purpose  file  systems  is
         strongly discouraged, and may adversely affect performance.

         The  size specified must be a power of two greater than or equal to <u>512</u> <u>B</u> and less than or equal to <u>128</u>
         <u>KiB</u>.  If the <b>large_blocks</b> feature is enabled on  the  pool,  the  size  may  be  up  to  <u>16</u>  <u>MiB</u>.   See
         <u><a href="../man7/zpool-features.7.html">zpool-features</a></u>(7) for details on ZFS feature flags.

         However,  blocks larger than <u>1</u> <u>MiB</u> can have an impact on i/o latency (e.g. tying up a spinning disk for
         ~300ms), and also potentially on the memory allocator.

         Note that maximum size is still limited by default to <u>1</u> <u>MiB</u> on x86_32,  see  <b>zfs_max_recordsize</b>  module
         parameter.

         Changing  the  file  system's  <b>recordsize</b>  affects  only  files  created  afterward; existing files are
         unaffected.

         This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>recsize</b>.

       <b>redundant_metadata</b>=<b>all</b>|<b>most</b>|<b>some</b>|<b>none</b>
         Controls what types of metadata are stored redundantly.  ZFS stores an extra copy of metadata, so  that
         if  a  single  block  is  corrupted,  the  amount  of user data lost is limited.  This extra copy is in
         addition to any redundancy provided at the pool level (e.g. by mirroring or RAID-Z), and is in addition
         to an extra copy specified by the <b>copies</b> property (up to a total of 3 copies).  For example if the pool
         is mirrored, <b>copies</b>=2, and <b>redundant_metadata</b>=<b>most</b>, then ZFS stores 6 copies of most  metadata,  and  4
         copies of data and some metadata.

         When  set  to  <b>all</b>, ZFS stores an extra copy of all metadata.  If a single on-disk block is corrupt, at
         worst a single block of user data (which is <b>recordsize</b> bytes long) can be lost.

         When set to <b>most</b>, ZFS stores an extra copy of most types of metadata.  This can improve performance  of
         random  writes,  because  less  metadata  must be written.  In practice, at worst about 1000 blocks (of
         <b>recordsize</b> bytes each) of user data can be lost if a  single  on-disk  block  is  corrupt.   The  exact
         behavior of which metadata blocks are stored redundantly may change in future releases.

         When  set  to  <b>some</b>,  ZFS stores an extra copy of only critical metadata.  This can improve file create
         performance since less metadata needs to be written.  If a single on-disk block is corrupt, at worst  a
         single user file can be lost.

         When  set to <b>none</b>, ZFS does not store any copies of metadata redundantly.  If a single on-disk block is
         corrupt, an entire dataset can be lost.

         The default value is <b>all</b>.

       <b>refquota</b>=<u>size</u>|<b>none</b>
         Limits the amount of space a dataset can consume.  This property enforces a hard limit on the amount of
         space used.  This hard limit does not include space used by descendants,  including  file  systems  and
         snapshots.

       <b>refreservation</b>=<u>size</u>|<b>none</b>|<b>auto</b>
         The minimum amount of space guaranteed to a dataset, not including its descendants.  When the amount of
         space  used  is  below  this  value, the dataset is treated as if it were taking up the amount of space
         specified by <b>refreservation</b>.  The <b>refreservation</b> reservation is accounted for in the  parent  datasets'
         space used, and counts against the parent datasets' quotas and reservations.

         If <b>refreservation</b> is set, a snapshot is only allowed if there is enough free pool space outside of this
         reservation to accommodate the current number of "referenced" bytes in the dataset.

         If <b>refreservation</b> is set to <b>auto</b>, a volume is thick provisioned (or "not sparse").  <b>refreservation</b>=<b>auto</b>
         is  only  supported  on  volumes.   See <b>volsize</b> in the “Native Properties” section for more information
         about sparse volumes.

         This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>refreserv</b>.

       <b>relatime</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>
         Controls the manner in which the access time is updated when <b>atime</b>=<b>on</b> is set.  Turning this property on
         causes the access time to be updated relative to the modify  or  change  time.   Access  time  is  only
         updated  if  the  previous  access  time  was  earlier than the current modify or change time or if the
         existing access time hasn't been updated within the past 24 hours.   The  default  value  is  <b>on</b>.   The
         values <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> are equivalent to the <b>relatime</b> and <b>norelatime</b> mount options.

       <b>reservation</b>=<u>size</u>|<b>none</b>
         The minimum amount of space guaranteed to a dataset and its descendants.  When the amount of space used
         is  below  this  value, the dataset is treated as if it were taking up the amount of space specified by
         its reservation.  Reservations are accounted for in the parent datasets' space used, and count  against
         the parent datasets' quotas and reservations.

         This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>reserv</b>.

       <b>secondarycache</b>=<b>all</b>|<b>none</b>|<b>metadata</b>
         Controls what is cached in the secondary cache (L2ARC).  If this property is set to <b>all</b>, then both user
         data  and  metadata is cached.  If this property is set to <b>none</b>, then neither user data nor metadata is
         cached.  If this property is set to <b>metadata</b>, then only metadata is cached.  The default value is <b>all</b>.

       <b>prefetch</b>=<b>all</b>|<b>none</b>|<b>metadata</b>
         Controls what speculative prefetch does.  If this property is set to  <b>all</b>,  then  both  user  data  and
         metadata  are  prefetched.   If  this  property is set to <b>none</b>, then neither user data nor metadata are
         prefetched.  If this property is set to <b>metadata</b>, then only metadata are prefetched.  The default value
         is <b>all</b>.

         Please note that the module parameter zfs_prefetch_disable=1 can be used to totally disable speculative
         prefetch, bypassing anything this property does.

       <b>setuid</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>
         Controls whether the setuid bit is respected for the file system.  The default value is <b>on</b>.  The values
         <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> are equivalent to the <b>suid</b> and <b>nosuid</b> mount options.

       <b>sharesmb</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>|<u>opts</u>
         Controls whether the file system is shared by using <b>Samba</b> <b>USERSHARES</b> and what options are to  be  used.
         Otherwise,  the  file  system  is  automatically shared and unshared with the <b>zfs</b> <b>share</b> and <b>zfs</b> <b>unshare</b>
         commands.  If the property is set to on, the <u><a href="../man8/net.8.html">net</a></u>(8) command is invoked to create a <b>USERSHARE</b>.

         Because SMB shares requires a resource name, a unique resource name is  constructed  from  the  dataset
         name.   The  constructed  name  is a copy of the dataset name except that the characters in the dataset
         name, which would be invalid in the resource name, are replaced with underscore (_) characters.   Linux
         does not currently support additional options which might be available on Solaris.

         If the <b>sharesmb</b> property is set to <b>off</b>, the file systems are unshared.

         The  share  is  created  with  the  ACL  (Access  Control  List)  "Everyone:F"  ("F"  stands  for "full
         permissions", i.e. read and write permissions) and no guest access (which means Samba must be  able  to
         authenticate  a  real user — <u><a href="../man5/passwd.5.html">passwd</a></u>(5)/<u><a href="../man5/shadow.5.html">shadow</a></u>(5)-, LDAP- or <u><a href="../man5/smbpasswd.5.html">smbpasswd</a></u>(5)-based) by default.  This means
         that any additional access control (disallow specific user specific access etc) must  be  done  on  the
         underlying file system.

         When  the  <b>sharesmb</b> property is updated with <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> <b>-u</b> , the property is set to desired value, but the
         operation to share, reshare or unshare the the dataset is not performed.

       <b>sharenfs</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>|<u>opts</u>
         Controls whether the file system is shared via NFS, and what options are to be  used.   A  file  system
         with a <b>sharenfs</b> property of <b>off</b> is managed with the <u><a href="../man8/exportfs.8.html">exportfs</a></u>(8) command and entries in the <u>/etc/exports</u>
         file.   Otherwise,  the  file  system  is  automatically shared and unshared with the <b>zfs</b> <b>share</b> and <b>zfs</b>
         <b>unshare</b> commands.  If the property is set to <b>on</b>, the dataset is shared using the default options:
               <b>sec=sys,rw,crossmnt,no_subtree_check</b>

         Please note that the options are comma-separated, unlike those found in <u><a href="../man5/exports.5.html">exports</a></u>(5).  This  is  done  to
         negate the need for quoting, as well as to make parsing with scripts easier.

         For FreeBSD, there may be multiple sets of options separated by semicolon(s).  Each set of options must
         apply  to  different  hosts  or  networks  and  each  set  of  options  will create a separate line for
         <u><a href="../man5/exports.5.html">exports</a></u>(5).  Any semicolon separated option set that consists entirely of whitespace will  be  ignored.
         This use of semicolons is only for FreeBSD at this time.

         See  <u><a href="../man5/exports.5.html">exports</a></u>(5)  for the meaning of the default options.  Otherwise, the <u><a href="../man8/exportfs.8.html">exportfs</a></u>(8) command is invoked
         with options equivalent to the contents of this property.

         When the <b>sharenfs</b> property is changed for a dataset,  the  dataset  and  any  children  inheriting  the
         property  are  re-shared with the new options, only if the property was previously <b>off</b>, or if they were
         shared before the property was changed.  If the new property is <b>off</b>, the file systems are unshared.

         When the <b>sharenfs</b> property is updated with <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> <b>-u</b> , the property is set to desired value,  but  the
         operation to share, reshare or unshare the the dataset is not performed.

       <b>logbias</b>=<b>latency</b>|<b>throughput</b>
         Provide  a  hint  to  ZFS about handling of synchronous requests in this dataset.  If <b>logbias</b> is set to
         <b>latency</b> (the default), ZFS will use pool log devices (if configured) to  handle  the  requests  at  low
         latency.   If  <b>logbias</b>  is  set  to <b>throughput</b>, ZFS will not use configured pool log devices.  ZFS will
         instead optimize synchronous operations for global pool throughput and efficient use of resources.

       <b>snapdev</b>=<b>hidden</b>|<b>visible</b>
         Controls whether the volume snapshot devices under <u>/dev/zvol/</u>⟨<u>pool</u>⟩ are hidden or visible.  The default
         value is <b>hidden</b>.

       <b>snapdir</b>=<b>disabled</b>|<b>hidden</b>|<b>visible</b>
         Controls whether the <u>.zfs</u> directory is disabled, hidden or visible in the root of the  file  system  as
         discussed in the “Snapshots” section of <u><a href="../man7/zfsconcepts.7.html">zfsconcepts</a></u>(7).  The default value is <b>hidden</b>.

       <b>sync</b>=<b>standard</b>|<b>always</b>|<b>disabled</b>
         Controls  the  behavior of synchronous requests (e.g. fsync, O_DSYNC).  <b>standard</b> is the POSIX-specified
         behavior of ensuring all synchronous requests are written to stable storage and all devices are flushed
         to ensure data is not cached by device controllers (this is the default).   <b>always</b>  causes  every  file
         system  transaction  to  be  written  and  flushed  before  its  system call returns.  This has a large
         performance penalty.  <b>disabled</b> disables  synchronous  requests.   File  system  transactions  are  only
         committed  to stable storage periodically.  This option will give the highest performance.  However, it
         is very dangerous as ZFS would be ignoring the synchronous transaction demands of applications such  as
         databases or NFS.  Administrators should only use this option when the risks are understood.

       <b>version</b>=<u>N</u>|<b>current</b>
         The  on-disk  version of this file system, which is independent of the pool version.  This property can
         only be set to later supported versions.  See the <b>zfs</b> <b>upgrade</b> command.

       <b>volsize</b>=<u>size</u>
         For volumes, specifies the logical size of the volume.  By default, creating  a  volume  establishes  a
         reservation of equal size.  For storage pools with a version number of 9 or higher, a <b>refreservation</b> is
         set  instead.   Any  changes  to  <b>volsize</b>  are reflected in an equivalent change to the reservation (or
         <b>refreservation</b>).  The <b>volsize</b> can only be set to a multiple of <b>volblocksize</b>, and cannot be zero.

         The reservation is kept equal  to  the  volume's  logical  size  to  prevent  unexpected  behavior  for
         consumers.  Without the reservation, the volume could run out of space, resulting in undefined behavior
         or  data corruption, depending on how the volume is used.  These effects can also occur when the volume
         size is changed while it is in use (particularly when shrinking the size).  Extreme care should be used
         when adjusting the volume size.

         Though not recommended, a "sparse volume"  (also  known  as  "thin  provisioned")  can  be  created  by
         specifying  the  <b>-s</b> option to the <b>zfs</b> <b>create</b> <b>-V</b> command, or by changing the value of the <b>refreservation</b>
         property (or <b>reservation</b> property on pool version 8 or earlier) after the volume has been  created.   A
         "sparse  volume" is a volume where the value of <b>refreservation</b> is less than the size of the volume plus
         the space required to store its metadata.  Consequently, writes to a sparse volume can fail with ENOSPC
         when the pool is low on space.  For a sparse volume, changes  to  <b>volsize</b>  are  not  reflected  in  the
         <b>refreservation</b>.   A  volume  that is not sparse is said to be "thick provisioned".  A sparse volume can
         become thick provisioned by setting <b>refreservation</b> to <b>auto</b>.

       <b>volmode</b>=<b>default</b>|<b>full</b>|<b>geom</b>|<b>dev</b>|<b>none</b>
         This property specifies how volumes should be exposed to the OS.  Setting it to <b>full</b> exposes volumes as
         fully fledged block devices, providing maximal functionality.  The value <b>geom</b> is just an alias for <b>full</b>
         and is kept for compatibility.  Setting it to <b>dev</b> hides its partitions.  Volumes with property  set  to
         <b>none</b> are not exposed outside ZFS, but can be snapshotted, cloned, replicated, etc, that can be suitable
         for  backup purposes.  Value <b>default</b> means that volumes exposition is controlled by system-wide tunable
         <b>zvol_volmode</b>, where <b>full</b>, <b>dev</b> and <b>none</b> are encoded as 1, 2 and 3 respectively.  The  default  value  is
         <b>full</b>.

       <b>vscan</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>
         Controls  whether  regular  files  should  be scanned for viruses when a file is opened and closed.  In
         addition to enabling this property, the virus scan service must also be enabled for virus  scanning  to
         occur.  The default value is <b>off</b>.  This property is not used by OpenZFS.

       <b>xattr</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>|<b>dir</b>|<b>sa</b>
         Controls  whether  extended  attributes  are  enabled  for  this  file  system.  Two styles of extended
         attributes are supported: either directory-based or system-attribute-based.

         Directory-based extended attributes can be enabled by setting the value to <b>dir</b>.  This style of extended
         attribute imposes no practical limit on either the size or number of attributes which can be set  on  a
         file.  Although under Linux the <u><a href="../man2/getxattr.2.html">getxattr</a></u>(2) and <u><a href="../man2/setxattr.2.html">setxattr</a></u>(2) system calls limit the maximum size to <b>64K</b>.
         This is the most compatible style of extended attribute and is supported by all ZFS implementations.

         System-attribute-based  xattrs  can  be enabled by setting the value to <b>sa</b> (default and equal to <b>on</b> ) .
         The key advantage of this type of xattr is improved performance.  Storing extended attributes as system
         attributes significantly decreases the amount of disk I/O required.  Up to <b>64K</b> of data  may  be  stored
         per-file  in  the  space reserved for system attributes.  If there is not enough space available for an
         extended attribute then it will be automatically written as a directory-based xattr.  System-attribute-
         based extended attributes are not accessible on platforms which do not support  the  <b>xattr</b>=<b>sa</b>  feature.
         OpenZFS supports <b>xattr</b>=<b>sa</b> on both FreeBSD and Linux.

         The  use  of  system-attribute-based  xattrs is strongly encouraged for users of SELinux or POSIX ACLs.
         Both of these features heavily rely on extended attributes and benefit significantly from  the  reduced
         access time.

         The values <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> are equivalent to the <b>xattr</b> and <b>noxattr</b> mount options.

       <b>jailed</b>=<b>off</b>|<b>on</b>
         Controls  whether the dataset is managed from a jail.  See <u><a href="../man8/zfs-jail.8.html">zfs-jail</a></u>(8) for more information.  Jails are
         a FreeBSD feature and this property is not available on other platforms.

       <b>zoned</b>=<b>off</b>|<b>on</b>
         Controls whether the dataset is managed from a non-global zone or namespace.  See <u><a href="../man8/zfs-zone.8.html">zfs-zone</a></u>(8) for  more
         information.  Zoning is a Linux feature and this property is not available on other platforms.

       The  following three properties cannot be changed after the file system is created, and therefore, should
       be set when the file system is created.  If the properties are not set  with  the  <b>zfs</b>  <b>create</b>  or  <b>zpool</b>
       <b>create</b>  commands,  these  properties  are inherited from the parent dataset.  If the parent dataset lacks
       these properties due to having been created prior to these features being supported, the new file  system
       will have the default values for these properties.

       <b>casesensitivity</b>=<b>sensitive</b>|<b>insensitive</b>|<b>mixed</b>
         Indicates  whether  the  file name matching algorithm used by the file system should be case-sensitive,
         case-insensitive, or allow a combination of both  styles  of  matching.   The  default  value  for  the
         <b>casesensitivity</b>  property is <b>sensitive</b>.  Traditionally, Unix and POSIX file systems have case-sensitive
         file names.

         The <b>mixed</b> value for the <b>casesensitivity</b> property indicates that the file system  can  support  requests
         for  both  case-sensitive and case-insensitive matching behavior.  Currently, case-insensitive matching
         behavior on a file system that supports mixed behavior is limited to the SMB server product.  For  more
         information about the <b>mixed</b> value behavior, see the "ZFS Administration Guide".

       <b>normalization</b>=<b>none</b>|<b>formC</b>|<b>formD</b>|<b>formKC</b>|<b>formKD</b>
         Indicates  whether  the  file  system should perform a <b>Unicode</b> normalization of file names whenever two
         file names are compared, and which normalization algorithm should  be  used.   File  names  are  always
         stored  unmodified, names are normalized as part of any comparison process.  If this property is set to
         a legal value other than <b>none</b>, and the <b>utf8only</b> property was left unspecified, the <b>utf8only</b> property is
         automatically set to <b>on</b>.  The default value of the  <b>normalization</b>  property  is  <b>none</b>.   This  property
         cannot be changed after the file system is created.

       <b>utf8only</b>=<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>
         Indicates whether the file system should reject file names that include characters that are not present
         in the <b>UTF-8</b> character code set.  If this property is explicitly set to <b>off</b>, the normalization property
         must  either  not  be explicitly set or be set to <b>none</b>.  The default value for the <b>utf8only</b> property is
         <b>off</b>.  This property cannot be changed after the file system is created.

       The <b>casesensitivity</b>, <b>normalization</b>, and <b>utf8only</b> properties are also new permissions that can be assigned
       to non-privileged users by using the ZFS delegated administration feature.

   <b>Temporary</b> <b>Mount</b> <b>Point</b> <b>Properties</b>
       When a file system is mounted, either through <u><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></u>(8) for legacy mounts or the  <b>zfs</b>  <b>mount</b>  command  for
       normal  file  systems,  its  mount  options are set according to its properties.  The correlation between
       properties and mount options is as follows:
             <b>atime</b>         atime/noatime
             <b>canmount</b>      auto/noauto
             <b>devices</b>       dev/nodev
             <b>exec</b>          exec/noexec
             <b>readonly</b>      ro/rw
             <b>relatime</b>      relatime/norelatime
             <b>setuid</b>        suid/nosuid
             <b>xattr</b>         xattr/noxattr
             <b>nbmand</b>        mand/nomand
             <b>context</b>=      context=
             <b>fscontext</b>=    fscontext=
             <b>defcontext</b>=   defcontext=
             <b>rootcontext</b>=  rootcontext=

       In addition, these options can be set on a per-mount basis using the <b>-o</b>  option,  without  affecting  the
       property  that is stored on disk.  The values specified on the command line override the values stored in
       the dataset.  The <b>nosuid</b> option is an alias for <b>nodevices</b>,<b>nosetuid</b>.  These  properties  are  reported  as
       "temporary"  by the <b>zfs</b> <b>get</b> command.  If the properties are changed while the dataset is mounted, the new
       setting overrides any temporary settings.

   <b>User</b> <b>Properties</b>
       In addition to the standard native properties, ZFS supports arbitrary user properties.   User  properties
       have  no  effect  on  ZFS  behavior, but applications or administrators can use them to annotate datasets
       (file systems, volumes, and snapshots).

       User property names must contain a colon ("<b>:</b>") character to  distinguish  them  from  native  properties.
       They  may contain lowercase letters, numbers, and the following punctuation characters: colon ("<b>:</b>"), dash
       ("<b>-</b>"), period ("<b>.</b>"), and underscore ("<b>_</b>").  The expected convention is that the property name is  divided
       into  two  portions  such  as  <u>module</u>:<u>property</u>, but this namespace is not enforced by ZFS.  User property
       names can be at most 256 characters, and cannot begin with a dash ("<b>-</b>").

       When making programmatic use of user properties, it is strongly suggested to use a  reversed  DNS  domain
       name  for  the  <u>module</u>  component of property names to reduce the chance that two independently-developed
       packages use the same property name for different purposes.

       The values of user properties are arbitrary strings, are always inherited, and are never validated.   All
       of  the  commands  that  operate  on properties (<b>zfs</b> <b>list</b>, <b>zfs</b> <b>get</b>, <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b>, and so forth) can be used to
       manipulate both native properties and user properties.  Use the <b>zfs</b>  <b>inherit</b>  command  to  clear  a  user
       property.  If the property is not defined in any parent dataset, it is removed entirely.  Property values
       are limited to 8192 bytes.

OpenZFS                                           June 29, 2024                                      <u><a href="../man7/ZFSPROPS.7.html">ZFSPROPS</a></u>(7)
