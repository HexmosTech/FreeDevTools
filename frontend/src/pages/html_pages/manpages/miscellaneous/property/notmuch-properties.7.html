</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Several  notmuch  commands  can  search  for,  modify,  add or remove properties associated with specific
       messages.  Properties are key/value pairs, and a message can have more than one key/value  pair  for  the
       same key.

       While  users can select based on a specific property in their search terms with the prefix <b>property:</b>, the
       notmuch command-line interface does not provide mechanisms for modifying properties directly to the user.

       Instead, message properties are expected to be set and  used  programmatically,  according  to  logic  in
       notmuch itself, or in extensions to it.

       Extensions  to notmuch which make use of properties are encouraged to report the specific properties used
       to the upstream notmuch project, as a way of avoiding collisions in the property namespace.

</pre><h4><b>CONVENTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Any property with a key that starts with "index." will be removed (and possibly re-set)  upon  reindexing
       (see <u>notmuch-reindex</u>).

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGE</b> <b>PROPERTIES</b></h4><pre>
       The following properties are set by notmuch internally in the course of its normal activity.

       <b>index.decryption</b>
              If  a  message  contains  encrypted  content,  and  notmuch  tries  to decrypt that content during
              indexing, it will add the property <b>index.decryption=success</b> when the  cleartext  was  successfully
              indexed.  If notmuch attempts to decrypt any part of a message during indexing and that decryption
              attempt fails, it will add the property <b>index.decryption=failure</b> to the message.

              Note  that  it's  possible  for  a  single  message  to  have  both  <b>index.decryption=success</b>  and
              <b>index.decryption=failure</b>.  Consider an encrypted e-mail message that  contains  another  encrypted
              e-mail  message  as  an attachment -- if the outer message can be decrypted, but the attached part
              cannot, then both properties will be set on the message as a whole.

              If notmuch never tried to decrypt an encrypted message during indexing (which is the default,  see
              <b>index.decrypt</b> in <u>notmuch-config</u>), then this property will not be set on that message.

       <b>session-key</b>
              When <u>notmuch-show</u> or <u>notmuch-reply</u> encounters a message with an encrypted part, if notmuch finds a
              <b>session-key</b>  property  associated  with  the  message,  it  will  try that stashed session key for
              decryption.

              If you do not want to use any stashed session keys that might be present, you  should  pass  those
              programs <b>--decrypt=false</b>.

              Using a stashed session key with "notmuch show" will speed up rendering of long encrypted threads.
              It  also allows the user to destroy the secret part of any expired encryption-capable subkey while
              still being able to read any retained messages for which they have stashed the session key.   This
              enables  truly  deletable  e-mail,  since  (once  the  session  key and asymmetric subkey are both
              destroyed) there are no keys left that can be used to decrypt any copy  of  the  original  message
              previously stored by an adversary.

              However,  access  to  the  stashed session key for an encrypted message permits full byte-for-byte
              reconstruction of the cleartext message.  This includes attachments, cryptographic signatures, and
              other material that cannot be reconstructed from the index alone.

              See <b>index.decrypt</b> in <u>notmuch-config</u> for more details about how to set notmuch's policy on when  to
              store session keys.

              The session key should be in the ASCII text form produced by GnuPG.  For OpenPGP, that consists of
              a  decimal  representation  of the hash algorithm used (identified by number from RFC 4880, e.g. 9
              means  AES-256)  followed  by  a  colon,  followed  by  a  hexadecimal   representation   of   the
              algorithm-specific  key.   For  example, an AES-128 key might be stashed in a notmuch property as:
              <b>session-key=7:14B16AF65536C28AF209828DFE34C9E0</b>.

       <b>index.repaired</b>
              Some messages arrive in forms that are confusing to view; they can be mangled  by  mail  transport
              agents,  or the sending mail user agent may structure them in a way that is confusing.  If notmuch
              knows how to both detect and repair such a problematic message, it will do so during indexing.

              If it applies a message repair during indexing, it will use the <b>index.repaired</b>  property  to  note
              the type of repair(s) it performed.

              <b>index.repaired=skip-protected-headers-legacy-display</b> indicates that when indexing the cleartext of
              an  encrypted  message,  notmuch  skipped over a "legacy-display" text/rfc822-headers part that it
              found in that message, since it was able to index the built-in protected headers directly.

              <b>index.repaired=mixedup</b> indicates the repair of a "Mixed Up" encrypted PGP/MIME message, a mangling
              typically       produced       by       Microsoft's       Exchange       MTA.         See        ‚Äê
              <u>https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dkg-openpgp-pgpmime-message-mangling</u> for more information.
