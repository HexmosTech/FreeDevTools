       vdevprops — native and user-defined properties of ZFS vdevs

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Properties are divided into two types, native properties and user-defined (or "user") properties.  Native
       properties either export internal statistics or control ZFS behavior.  In addition, native properties are
       either  editable  or  read-only.  User properties have no effect on ZFS behavior, but you can use them to
       annotate vdevs in a way that is  meaningful  in  your  environment.   For  more  information  about  user
       properties, see the “User Properties” section, below.

   <b>Native</b> <b>Properties</b>
       Every  vdev  has  a  set  of  properties that export statistics about the vdev as well as control various
       behaviors.  Properties are not  inherited  from  top-level  vdevs,  with  the  exception  of  checksum_n,
       checksum_t, io_n, io_t, slow_io_n, and slow_io_t.

       The  values  of numeric properties can be specified using human-readable suffixes (for example, <b>k</b>, <b>KB</b>, <b>M</b>,
       <b>Gb</b>, and so forth, up to <b>Z</b> for zettabyte).  The following are all valid (and equal) specifications: <b>1536M</b>,
       <b>1.5g</b>, <b>1.50GB</b>.

       The values of non-numeric properties are case sensitive and must be lowercase.

       The following native properties consist of read-only statistics about the vdev.  These properties can not
       be changed.

       <b>capacity</b>       Percentage of vdev space used

       <b>state</b>          state of this vdev such as online, faulted, or offline

       <b>guid</b>           globally unique id of this vdev

       <b>asize</b>          The allocatable size of this vdev

       <b>psize</b>          The physical size of this vdev

       <b>ashift</b>         The physical sector size of this vdev expressed as the power of two

       <b>size</b>           The total size of this vdev

       <b>free</b>           The amount of remaining free space on this vdev

       <b>allocated</b>      The amount of allocated space on this vdev

       <b>expandsize</b>     How much this vdev can expand by

       <b>fragmentation</b>  Percent of fragmentation in this vdev

       <b>parity</b>         The level of parity for this vdev

       <b>devid</b>          The device id for this vdev

       <b>physpath</b>       The physical path to the device

       <b>encpath</b>        The enclosure path to the device

       <b>fru</b>            Field Replaceable Unit, usually a model number

       <b>parent</b>         Parent of this vdev

       <b>children</b>       Comma separated list of children of this vdev

       <b>numchildren</b>    The number of children belonging to this vdev

       <b>read_errors</b>, <b>write_errors</b>, <b>checksum_errors</b>, <b>initialize_errors</b>, <b>trim_errors</b>
                      The number of errors of each type encountered by this vdev

       <b>slow_ios</b>       The number of slow I/Os encountered by this vdev,  These  represent  I/O  operations  that
                      didn't complete in <b>zio_slow_io_ms</b> milliseconds (<b>30000</b> by default).

       <b>null_ops</b>, <b>read_ops</b>, <b>write_ops</b>, <b>free_ops</b>, <b>claim_ops</b>, <b>trim_ops</b>
                      The number of I/O operations of each type performed by this vdev

       <b>null_bytes</b>, <b>read_bytes</b>, <b>write_bytes</b>, <b>free_bytes</b>, <b>claim_bytes</b>, <b>trim_bytes</b>
                      The cumulative size of all operations of each type performed by this vdev

       <b>removing</b>       If this device is currently being removed from the pool

       <b>trim_support</b>   Indicates if a leaf device supports trim operations.

       The following native properties can be used to change the behavior of a vdev.

       <b>checksum_n</b>, <b>checksum_t</b>, <b>io_n</b>, <b>io_t</b>, <b>slow_io_n</b>, <b>slow_io_t</b>
                   Tune  the  fault  management daemon by specifying checksum/io thresholds of &lt;N&gt; errors in &lt;T&gt;
                   seconds, respectively.  These properties can be set on leaf and top-level  vdevs.   When  the
                   property  is set on the leaf and top-level vdev, the value of the leaf vdev will be used.  If
                   the property is only set on the top-level vdev, this value will be used.  The value of  these
                   properties  do  not persist across vdev replacement.  For this reason, it is advisable to set
                   the property on the top-level vdev - not on the leaf vdev itself.   The  default  values  for
                   <b>OpenZFS</b> <b>on</b> <b>Linux</b> are 10 errors in 600 seconds.  For <b>OpenZFS</b> <b>on</b> <b>FreeBSD</b> defaults see <u><a href="../man8/zfsd.8.html">zfsd</a></u>(8).

       <b>comment</b>     A text comment up to 8192 characters long

       <b>bootsize</b>    The amount of space to reserve for the EFI system partition

       <b>failfast</b>    If this device should propagate BIO errors back to ZFS, used to disable failfast.

       <b>path</b>        The path to the device for this vdev

       <b>allocating</b>  If  this device should perform new allocations, used to disable a device when it is scheduled
                   for later removal.  See <u><a href="../man8/zpool-remove.8.html">zpool-remove</a></u>(8).

   <b>User</b> <b>Properties</b>
       In addition to the standard native properties, ZFS supports arbitrary user properties.   User  properties
       have no effect on ZFS behavior, but applications or administrators can use them to annotate vdevs.

       User  property  names  must  contain  a colon ("<b>:</b>") character to distinguish them from native properties.
       They may contain lowercase letters, numbers, and the following punctuation characters: colon ("<b>:</b>"),  dash
       ("<b>-</b>"),  period ("<b>.</b>"), and underscore ("<b>_</b>").  The expected convention is that the property name is divided
       into two portions such as <u>module</u>:<u>property</u>, but this namespace is not  enforced  by  ZFS.   User  property
       names can be at most 256 characters, and cannot begin with a dash ("<b>-</b>").

       When  making  programmatic  use of user properties, it is strongly suggested to use a reversed DNS domain
       name for the <u>module</u> component of property names to reduce the  chance  that  two  independently-developed
       packages use the same property name for different purposes.

       The  values  of user properties are arbitrary strings and are never validated.  Use the <b>zpool</b> <b>set</b> command
       with a blank value to clear a user property.  Property values are limited to 8192 bytes.
