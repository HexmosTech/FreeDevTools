</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tbl — tbl language reference for mandoc

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>tbl</b> language formats tables.  It is used within <u><a href="../man7/mdoc.7.html">mdoc</a></u>(7) and <u><a href="../man7/man.7.html">man</a></u>(7) pages.  This manual describes the
       subset of the <b>tbl</b> language accepted by the <u><a href="../man1/mandoc.1.html">mandoc</a></u>(1) utility.

       Each table is started with a <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) <b>TS</b> macro, consist of at most one line  of  “Options”,  one  or  more
       “Layout” lines, one or more “Data” lines, and ends with a <b>TE</b> macro.  All input must be 7-bit ASCII.

   <b>Options</b>
       If  the first input line of a table ends with a semicolon, it contains case-insensitive options separated
       by spaces, tabs, or commas.  Otherwise, it is interpreted as the first “Layout” line.

       The following options are available.  Some of them require arguments enclosed in parentheses:

       <b>allbox</b>  Draw a single-line box around each table cell.

       <b>box</b>     Draw a single-line box around the table.  For GNU compatibility, this may also  be  invoked  with
               <b>frame</b>.

       <b>center</b>  Center  the  table instead of left-adjusting it.  For GNU compatibility, this may also be invoked
               with <b>centre</b>.

       <b>decimalpoint</b>
               Use the single-character argument as the decimal point with the <b>n</b> layout  key.   This  is  a  GNU
               extension.

       <b>delim</b>   Use the two characters of the argument as <u><a href="../man7/eqn.7.html">eqn</a></u>(7) delimiters.  Currently unsupported.

       <b>doublebox</b>
               Draw  a  double-line  box around the table.  For GNU compatibility, this may also be invoked with
               <b>doubleframe</b>.

       <b>expand</b>  Increase the width of the table to the current line length.  Currently ignored.

       <b>linesize</b>
               Draw lines with the point size given by the unsigned integer argument.  Currently ignored.

       <b>nokeep</b>  Allow page breaks within the table.  This is a GNU extension and currently ignored.

       <b>nospaces</b>
               Ignore leading and trailing spaces in data cells.  This is a GNU extension.

       <b>nowarn</b>  Suppress warnings about tables exceeding the current line length.  This is a  GNU  extension  and
               currently ignored.

       <b>tab</b>     Use  the single-character argument as a delimiter between data cells.  By default, the horizontal
               tabulator character is used.

   <b>Layout</b>
       The table layout follows an “Options” line or a <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) <b>TS</b> or <b>T&amp;</b> macro.  Each layout line  specifies  how
       one  line  of  “Data”  is formatted.  The last layout line ends with a full stop.  It also applies to all
       remaining data lines.  Multiple layout lines can be joined by commas on a single physical input line.

       Each layout line consists of one or more layout cell specifications, optionally separated by  whitespace.
       The following case-insensitive key characters start a new cell specification:

       <b>c</b>   Center the string in this cell.

       <b>r</b>   Right-justify the string in this cell.

       <b>l</b>   Left-justify the string in this cell.

       <b>n</b>   Justify  a  number  around its last decimal point.  If no decimal point is found in the number, it is
           assumed to trail the number.

       <b>s</b>   Horizontally span columns from the last non-<b>s</b> layout cell.  It is an error if a column span follows a
           <b>_</b> or <b>=</b> cell, or comes first on a layout line.  The combined cell as a whole consumes only one cell of
           the corresponding data line.

       <b>a</b>   Left-justify a string and pad with one space.

       <b>^</b>   Vertically span rows from the last non-<b>^</b> layout cell.  It is an error to invoke a  vertical  span  on
           the  first  layout line.  Unlike a horizontal span, a vertical span consumes a data cell and discards
           the content.

       <b>_</b>   Draw a single horizontal line in this cell.  This consumes a data cell and discards the content.   It
           may also be invoked with <b>-</b>.

       <b>=</b>   Draw a double horizontal line in this cell.  This consumes a data cell and discards the content.

       Each cell key may be followed by zero or more of the following case-insensitive modifiers:

       <b>b</b>   Use a bold font for the contents of this cell.

       <b>d</b>   Move content down to the last row of this vertical span.  Currently ignored.

       <b>e</b>   Make this column wider to match the maximum width of any other column also having the <b>e</b> modifier.

       <b>f</b>   The  next  one or two characters select the font to use for this cell.  One-character font names must
           be followed by a blank or period.  See the <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) manual for supported font names.

       <b>i</b>   Use an italic font for the contents of this cell.

       <b>m</b>   Specify a cell start macro.  This is a GNU extension and currently unsupported.

       <b>p</b>   Set the point size to the following unsigned argument, or change it by the following signed argument.
           Currently ignored.

       <b>v</b>   Set the vertical line spacing to the following unsigned argument,  or  change  it  by  the  following
           signed argument.  Currently ignored.

       <b>t</b>   Do not vertically center content in this vertical span, leave it in the top row.  Currently ignored.

       <b>u</b>   Move cell content up by half a table row.  Currently ignored.

       <b>w</b>   Specify a minimum column width.

       <b>x</b>   After  determining  the  width of all other columns, distribute the rest of the line length among all
           columns having the <b>x</b> modifier.

       <b>z</b>   Do not use this cell for determining the width of this column.

       <b>|</b>   Draw a single vertical line to the right of this cell.

       <b>||</b>  Draw a double vertical line to the right of this cell.

       If a modifier consists of decimal digits, it specifies a minimum spacing  in  units  of  <b>n</b>  between  this
       column  and  the  next  column to the right.  The default is 3.  If there is a vertical line, it is drawn
       inside the spacing.

   <b>Data</b>
       The data section follows the last “Layout” line.  Each data line consists of  one  or  more  data  cells,
       delimited by <b>tab</b> characters.

       If  a  data  cell  contains  only  the two bytes ‘\^’, the cell above spans to this row, as if the layout
       specification of this cell were <b>^</b>.

       If a data cell contains only the single character ‘_’ or ‘=’, a single or double horizontal line is drawn
       across the cell, joining its neighbours.  If a data cell contains only the two character sequence ‘\_’ or
       ‘\=’, a single or double horizontal line is drawn inside the cell, not joining its neighbours.  If a data
       line contains nothing but the single character ‘_’ or ‘=’, a horizontal line across the  whole  table  is
       inserted without consuming a layout row.

       In  place  of  any data cell, a text block can be used.  It starts with <b>T{</b> at the end of a physical input
       line.  Input line breaks inside the text block neither end the text block nor its  data  cell.   It  only
       ends  if <b>T}</b> occurs at the beginning of a physical input line and is followed by an end-of-cell indicator.
       If the <b>T}</b> is followed by the end of the physical input line, the text block, the data cell, and the  data
       line  ends  at  this point.  If the <b>T}</b> is followed by the <b>tab</b> character, only the text block and the data
       cell end, but the data line continues with the data cell following the <b>tab</b> character.  If <b>T}</b> is  followed
       by any other character, it does not end the text block, which instead continues to the following physical
       input line.

       M. E. Lesk, <u>Tbl</u> <u>—</u> <u>A</u> <u>Program</u> <u>to</u> <u>Format</u> <u>Tables</u>, June 11, 1976.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The tbl utility, a preprocessor for troff, was originally written by M.  E. Lesk at Bell  Labs  in  1975.
       The  GNU  reimplementation  of  tbl,  part  of the groff package, was released in 1990 by James Clark.  A
       standalone tbl implementation was written by Kristaps Dzonsons in 2010.  This formed  the  basis  of  the
       implementation that first appeared in OpenBSD 4.9 as a part of the <u><a href="../man1/mandoc.1.html">mandoc</a></u>(1) utility.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       This <b>tbl</b> reference was written by Kristaps Dzonsons &lt;<u><a href="mailto:kristaps@bsd.lv">kristaps@bsd.lv</a></u>&gt; and
       Ingo Schwarze &lt;<u><a href="mailto:schwarze@openbsd.org">schwarze@openbsd.org</a></u>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       In  <b>-T</b>  <b>utf8</b> output mode, heavy lines are drawn instead of double lines.  This cannot be improved because
       the Unicode standard only provides an incomplete set of box drawing characters with double lines, whereas
       it provides a full set of box drawing characters with heavy lines.  It is unlikely this can  be  improved
       in  the  future  because  the box drawing characters are already marked in Unicode as characters intended
       only for backward compatibility with legacy systems, and their  use  is  not  encouraged.   So  it  seems
       unlikely that the missing ones might get added in the future.
