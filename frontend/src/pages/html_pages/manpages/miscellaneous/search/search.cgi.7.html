       search.cgi -- Example Perl program for searching with Swish-e and SWISH::API

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a very simple program that shows how to use the SWISH::API module in a CGI script or mod_perl
       handler using Template-Toolkit to generate output.  This program is intended for programmers that want to
       create a custom search script.

       Unlike <u>swish.cgi</u> this script does not have many features, and provides no external configuration (with
       the execption of a few config options under mod_perl).  So don't ask why it doesn't do something.  The
       point is that this script is used as a starting point that YOU customize.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       You must have swish-e and the SWISH::API module installed.  See the README and INSTALL documents in the
       swish-e distribution.  As of this writing SWISH::API is part of the swish-e distribution, but in the
       future may be provided as a separate package (provided on the CPAN).  In either case SWISH::API is a
       separate installation procedure from installing swish-e.  The Storable module is also required if using
       mod_perl.

       This program does require that some modules are installed from CPAN.  You will need Template-Toolkit and
       HTML::FillInForm (which depends on HTML::Parser).  How those are installed depends on your computer's
       packaging system.

       You will need a web server, obviously.  The discussion below assumes Apache is used.  If you are using MS
       IIS take note that IIS works differently in a number of ways.

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>search.cgi</u> script and related templates are installed when swish-e is installed.  <u>search.cgi</u> is
       installed in $prefix/lib/swish-e/ and templates are installed in $prefix/share/swish-e/templates/.
       $prefix is <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a> by default but can be changed when running the swish-e <u>configure</u> script.  Upon
       installation <u>search.cgi</u> is updated with correct paths to your perl binary and

       When running as a CGI script <u>search.cgi</u> is copied or symlinked to the location of your CGI scripts (or
       any directory that allows CGI scripts).  By default, the <u>search.cgi</u> script looks for the index
       <u>index.swish-e</u> in the current directory (that's what the web server considers the current directory).  On
       Apache running mod-cgi that's the same place as the script.  On IIS it's not.  If your index is elsewhere
       you will need to modify the script.

       The script works by parsing the query, calling SWISH::API to run the actual search, then calls Template-
       Toolkit to generate the ouput.

       The script calls the <u>search.tt</u> template.  This template generates the query form and the search results.
       The <u>search.tt</u> template uses a Template-Toolkit "WRAPPER" function to wrap the search form and results in
       your site's design.   This design is in the <u>page_layout</u> template.   The idea is if you use Template-
       Toolkit to manage your entire site then your entire site would be formatted by the same <u>page_layout</u>
       template.  The <u>page_layout</u> template calls two other templates <u>common_header</u> and <u>common_footer</u> to generate
       a common header and footer for the site.  Those are just demonstrating Template-Toolkit's features.

       The <u>page_layout</u> page only defines the basic structure of the site.  The true design of the site is
       managed by style sheets.  <u>style.css</u> defines the basic layout and <u>markup.css</u> sets fonts and colors.

       Note: these style sheets are included directly in the output of the CGI script.  In production the style
       sheets would be stored as separate style sheet files and imported by the browser instead of directly
       included in the search results page.

       See the section MOD_PERL below for more on templates.

       Highlighting of search terms is provided by the SWISH::PhraseHighlight module.  That is a very slow
       module, so you may wish to disable it if you expect a lot of traffic.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b> <b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Enough talking, sometimes it's nice to see a complete example.  Below swish-e is installed in the default
       location (<a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>).  The "$" is a normal user prompt, where "#" is a root prompt.  Use ./configure
       --prefix to install in another location (e.g. if you do not have root access).

       Download and install swish-e

           $ wget -q <a href="http://swish-e.org/Download/latest.tar.gz">http://swish-e.org/Download/latest.tar.gz</a>
           $ tar zxf latest.tar.gz
           $ cd swish-e-2.x.x
           $ (./configure &amp;&amp; make) &gt;/dev/null
           $ make check
           $ su
           # make install
           # exit

       Install SWISH::API

           $ cd perl
           $ perl Makefile.PL &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make test
           $ su
           # make install
           $ exit

       Install requried Perl modules.  You can install via RPMs, Debs or directly from the CPAN or by using the
       CPAN shell.

           # su
           # perl -MCPAN -e 'install Template'
           # perl -MCPAN -e 'install HTML::FillInForm'
           # exit

       Now setup the script in someplace that allows CGI scripts.

           $ cd $HOME/apache
           $ ln -s /usr/local/lib/swish-e/search.cgi .
           $ cat .htaccess
           deny from all
           &lt;files search.cgi&gt;
               allow from all
               SetHandler cgi-script
               Options +ExecCGI
           &lt;/files&gt;

       Create an index

           $ cat swish.config
           IndexOnly .htm .html
           DefaultContents HTML*
           StoreDescription HTML* &lt;body&gt;
           metanames swishtitle swishdocpath

           $ swish-e -c swish.config -i /usr/share/doc/apache-doc/manual

       Test the index and the CGI script:

           $ swish-e -w apache -m1 | grep hits
           # Number of hits: 152

           $ lynx -dump <a href="http://localhost/apache/search.cgi">http://localhost/apache/search.cgi</a>?query=apache | grep hits
               Showing page 1 (1 - 10 of 152 hits) [3]Next
                     'hits' =&gt; 152,

       Now, the above isn't very helpful because the Apache documentation indexed is not in the web space.  You
       would likely index content available on your web site.

</pre><h4><b>Using</b> <b>with</b> <b>SpeedyCGI</b></h4><pre>
       Perl CGI script must be compiled for each request.  SpeedyCGI is a tool to speed up scripts by running
       them persistently.  To run <u>search.cgi</u> with SpeedyCGI install the program (you can Google, right?) and
       then change the first line of <u>search.cgi</u> to run the <u>speedy</u> program.

       For example:

           #!/usr/bin/speedy -w

</pre><h4><b>Using</b> <b>with</b> <b>MOD_PERL</b></h4><pre>
       This script can be run directly as a mod_perl handler, and the same code can be used to run multiple
       sites by using separate Location directives and passing in a "site id."  The script caches in memory
       different configurations based on this site id.

       Below is a complete httpd.conf file.  It requires an Apache httpd that has mod_perl compiled in
       statically.  It runs mod_perl on a high port (port 5000) listening to all interfaces.

       For testing I put this config file in a directory along with <u>search.cgi</u>, but that's just done to make the
       example simple (i.e. so I don't have to show any absolute paths).  Normally the httpd.conf and the
       swish.cgi "module" would be in separate locations.

           # httpd.conf -- test file for search.cgi as mod_perl handler

           &lt;ifModule mod_so.c&gt;
               LoadModule mime_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_mime.so
           &lt;/IfModule&gt;

           ErrorLog swish_error_log
           PidFile swish_httpd.pid

           Listen *:5000

           &lt;perl&gt;
               push @PerlSetVar, [
                   index  =&gt; Apache-&gt;server_root_relative( 'index.swish-e'),
               ];
               $DocumentRoot =  Apache-&gt;server_root_relative;
               require "search.cgi";
           &lt;/perl&gt;

           NameVirtualHost *:5000
           &lt;VirtualHost *:5000&gt;

               ServerName localhost

               &lt;Location /search&gt;
                   SetHandler  perl-script
                   PerlHandler SwishAPISearch
               &lt;/Location&gt;

               &lt;Location /othersite&gt;
                   SetHandler perl-script
                   PerlHandler SwishAPISearch
                   # Define this site
                   PerlSetVar  site_id othersite
                   PerlSetVar  title "Some other Site"
               &lt;/Location&gt;

           &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

       The server is started using this command:

           $ /usr/sbin/apache-perl -d $(pwd) -f $(pwd)/httpd.conf

       which says to use the current directory as the ServerRoot.  (See comments below.)  Stop the server like:

           $ kill `cat swish_httpd.pid`

       Then access either:

           <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:5000/search
           <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:5000/othersite

       A few Notes:

       I like test configurations to not care where things are located.  Thus, the above httpd.conf does a few
       tricks in the "Perl Section" shown.

       First, mod_perl, unlike CGI, doesn't set the working directory.  So, the index file name must be
       absolute.  This is accomplished by a PerlSetVar entry building the index file name from the ServerRoot.

       Second, the DocumentRoot is set to the same as the ServerRoot.  The DocumentRoot needs to be set so
       search.cgi can figure out the path to the script (for creating next and previous links).

       Third, the script is loaded by a "require" statement.  This works only because the current directory "."
       is in Perl's @INC path at Apache start up time and <u>search.cgi</u> is also in the current directory.
       Normally, set PERL5LIB on server startup or use a "use lib" line in your startup.pl file to point to the
       location of search.cgi.

       The "PerlSetVar" lines pass config information into the script.  Note that they can be set globally or
       specific to a given Location.

       The following config options are currently available:

       site_id
           The  site_id  options  allow  caching  of  configurations on a per-site basis.  It's overkill in this
           example, but normally you might have expensive configuration processes that you might want to do only
           once.  But, since there is caching by this id it's a good id to set a site_id if using more than  one
           Location directive.

       index
           This  specifies  the  index  file  to  use.   The index file needs to be absolute as discussed above.
           Example:

               PerlSetVar index /usr/share/swish/site.index

       title
           This options sets the title that's passed into the template.

       template
           Sets the file name of the template use to generate the form.  This might be useful  if  you  want  an
           "advanced" form, for example.

       template_path
           This  can  be  used  to update the path where templates are searched.  Useful if you wish to override
           templates.

       page_size
           This allow changing the default number of results shown per page.
