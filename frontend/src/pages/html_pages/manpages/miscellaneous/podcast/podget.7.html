</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Podget</b> - Simple tool to automate downloading of podcasts.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>podget</b> &lt;options&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Podget is a simple podcast aggregator/downloader optimized for scheduled background jobs (i.e. cron).

       It features support for:
       - Downloading podcasts from RSS and ATOM XML feeds.
       - For sorting the files into folders and categories.
       - For importing URLs from iTunes PCAST files and OPML lists.
       - Automatic M3U &amp; ASX playlist creation.
       - Cleanup of old files.
       - Automatic UTF-16 conversion for feeds hosted on MS Windows Servers.

       Podget  works by extracting the &lt;enclosure&gt; tags from the feed then downloading the specified URL.  There
       is  one  exception  when  Podget  will  ignore  &lt;enclosure&gt;  tags  and  that  is  when  they  are  within
       &lt;podcast:liveItem&gt;  tags  because  Podget is an aggregator and not a player so has not been optimized for
       live content.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       By default, Podget relies on two configuration files.

       <u>podgetrc</u>
              This is a file with most options for how Podget should run.

              If it is required to run  podget  with  different  options  for  certain  feeds,  then  additional
              configuration  files  can be created and used with the --config or -c option.  When this option is
              run with a new filename that does not exist yet, the file is created with default options that can
              then be customized as necessary.

       <u>serverlist</u>
              This is a file of all the feeds that Podget should monitor and download from.

              If you need to separate your feeds into multiple lists, then additional files can be created  with
              the --serverlist option.  When this option is run with a new filename that does not exist yet, the
              file is created with a default list of a single feed.  Whenever a new list is created, Podget will
              download  a  single  item  from  the  single feed included by default to verify that everything is
              working.

              For a description of the options available  for  this  file,  please  refer  to  the  SERVER  LIST
              CONFIGURATION section of this document.

   <b>USER</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b>
       The  first time a user runs podget, it will create a configuration directory.  In this directory, it will
       install the default configuration files.

       Where this configuration directory is automatically placed is dependent upon the version of  Podget  that
       you used when you first ran it.

       For version 0.8.10 and before:
              $HOME/.podget

       For later versions:
              If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set then it will be placed in:  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/podget
              IF unset, then it will be placed in: $HOME/.config/podget

       If  a  user  wants  to clean up their $HOME directory by moving their existing configuration directory to
       either of the new locations, it can be done but it is necessary to remember to remove the leading  period
       so it is no longer a hidden directory.
              Example:  mv $HOME/.podget $HOME/.config/podget

       These locations can be overridden by the use of the --dir_config or -d option when you run podget.

   <b>WHICH</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>IS</b> <b>USED</b>
       Since there are at least three possible locations for the configuration directory then it is necessary to
       know  which  one podget will use.  To keep things simple, Podget uses the first one it finds and tests in
       the following order:

         1.  $HOME/.podget
         2.  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/podget
         3.  $HOME/.config/podget

       This location testing is skipped by the use of the --dir_config or -d option.

   <b>AUTOMATIC</b> <b>CLEANUP</b>
       You can enable automatic cleanup with every run by configuring it in your podgetrc file. Simply  set  the
       following options:

         # Autocleanup.
         # 0 == disabled
         # 1 == delete any old content
         cleanup=1

         # Number of days to keep files.   Cleanup will remove anything
         # older than this.
         cleanup_days=7

       However,  some  people  prefer  to run cleanup as a separate cron session. To do that, set the options in
       podgetrc to:

         # Autocleanup.
         # 0 == disabled
         # 1 == delete any old content
         cleanup=0

         # Number of days to keep files.   Cleanup will remove anything
         # older than this.
         cleanup_days=7

       Then add something similar to this example to your crontab:

         # Once a week on Sunday at 04:07AM
         07 04 * * Sun /usr/bin/podget -C

   <b>MULTIPLE</b> <b>CONCURRENT</b> <b>SESSIONS</b>
       Podget checks for sessions using the same core configuration file that may already  be  running  when  it
       starts  and  exits  if any are found.  This insures that any long running sessions are not interrupted by
       new ones.

       If you have feeds that require distinct configurations, then you can enable them to run simultaneously by
       using separate configuration files for each.  Then if you have sufficient bandwidth, you  can  call  them
       all at the same time.

       Example Crontab configuration:

         00 02 * * * /usr/bin/podget -c podgetrc-group1
         00 02 * * * /usr/bin/podget -c podgetrc-group2

   <b>SEQUENTIAL</b> <b>SESSIONS</b>
       Sometimes,  you have feed lists that use the same configuration but you wish to keep separate.  There are
       two ways to handle this.

       First, run then separately from crontab with sufficient time in between so they don't interfere with each
       other.

         00 02 * * * /usr/bin/podget --serverlist RSS-Feeds
         00 03 * * * /usr/bin/podget --serverlist ATOM-Feeds

       The second option is to place them into a shell script  so  they  are  called  sequentially  and  do  not
       interfere with each other and then add it to your crontab.

         #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?env">/usr/bin/env</a> bash
         /usr/bin/podget --serverlist RSS-Feeds
         /usr/bin/podget --serverlist ATOM-Feeds

   <b>ENABLING</b> <b>DEBUG</b> <b>OUTPUT</b>
       Debug output can be enabled in two ways.

       The  first  way is by uncommenting the DEBUG option in your podgetrc and setting it to '1'.  However this
       way will not enable DEBUG until just over 1400 lines of script have run and  when   podgetrc  finally  is
       read.  This is sufficient for most issues.

       The second way is from the command-line and enables debug as early as possible.

       Simply execute podget like so:

         $ DEBUG=1 podget -vvvv

       You  can enable other options as well if you need to but for debugging purposes, it is highly recommended
       that you enabled as much verbosity as possible.

   <b>SERVER</b> <b>LIST</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       By default, Podget uses serverlist for the default list of servers to contact. However you can  configure
       the name with the config_serverlist variable in your podgetrc file.

       Feeds are listed one per line in the serverlist file.

       Default format with category and name:
              &lt;url&gt; &lt;category&gt; &lt;name&gt;

       Alternate Formats:
       1. With a category but no name.
              &lt;url&gt; &lt;category&gt;
       2. With a name but no category (2 ways).
              &lt;url&gt; No_Category &lt;name&gt;
              &lt;url&gt; . &lt;name&gt;
       3. With neither a category or name.
              &lt;url&gt;

       1. URL Rules:
              A. Any spaces in the URL need to be converted to %20
       2. Category Rules:
              A. Must be one word without spaces.
              B. You may use underscores and dashes.
              C. You can insert date substitutions.
                     %YY%  ==  Year
                     %MM%  ==  Month
                     %DD%  ==  Day
              D. Category disabling:
                     - With a name, the category must either be a single period (.) or 'No_Category'.
                     - If the name is blank, the category can also be blank.
       3. Name Rules:
              A.  If  you are creating ASX playlists, make sure the feed name does not have any spaces in it and
              the filename cannot be blank.
              B. You can leave the feed name blank, and files will be saved in the category directory.
              C. Names with spaces are only compatible with filesystems that allow for spaces in filenames.  For
              example, spaces in feed names are OK for feeds saved to Linux ext partitions but are  not  OK  for
              those saved to Microsoft FAT partitions.
              D. Feed names can be disabled by leaving them blank.
       4. Disable the downloading of any feed by commenting it out with a leading #.

       Example:
        <a href="http://www.lugradio.org/episodes.rss">http://www.lugradio.org/episodes.rss</a> Linux LUG Radio

       Example with date substitution in the category and a blank feed name:
        https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/downloadtrial/worldservice/summary/rss.xml News-%YY%-%MM%-%DD%

       Example of two ways to do a feed with authentication:
        <a href="http://somesite.com/feed.rss">http://somesite.com/feed.rss</a> CATEGORY Feed Name USER:username PASS:password
        <a href="http://username">http://username</a>:<a href="mailto:password@somesite.com">password@somesite.com</a>/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name

              NOTE:  The  second  method  will  fail  if  a colon (:) is part of the username or password.  Both
              methods will fail if a space is part of the username or password.

       <b>Common</b> <b>Options:</b>

       <u>OPT_CONTENT_DISPOSITION</u>
              Attempt to get filename from the Content-Disposition tag that is part of wget --server-response.

       <u>OPT_DISPOSITION_FAIL</u>
              This option works in conjunction with OPT_CONTENT_DISPOSITION by removing any URLs  that  fail  to
              receive  a filename from the COMPLETED log.  This allows them to be automatically retried the next
              time a session runs.  If this option is added to a feed that has already been downloaded then  the
              user  will  need  to remove the URLs for the problematic files from the COMPLETED log manually. On
              one feed this allowed for the improvement of the number of filename  problems  from  approximately
              15%  to  under 2% over the course of 6 sessions.  Those sessions can occur sequentially on one day
              or as part of your established cron rotation.

       <u>OPT_FEED_ORDER_ASCENDING</u>
              By default, Podget assumes that items in a feed will be listed from newest to  oldest  (descending
              order).   This  option  will  modify  Podget's handling of the feed for those that are listed from
              oldest to newest.  This option will not have any noticeable effect for feeds  where  you  want  to
              download every item.  It will have an effect for new feeds when combined with the --recent [COUNT]
              option.

       <u>OPT_FEED_PLAYLIST_NEWFIRST</u>
              Most  playlist  options  create  lists  of  just  the new items that are downloaded in the current
              session.  This option creates or updates a full playlist for all items available for a feed sorted
              from newest to oldest based on the modification date/time of the file.

       <u>OPT_FEED_PLAYLIST_OLDFIRST</u>
              Same as OPT_FEED_PLAYLIST_NEWFIRST except playlist is ordered from oldest to newest.

       <u>OPT_FILENAME_LOCATION</u>
              Some feeds do not have the detailed filename listed in the FEED but  rather  rename  the  file  on
              redirection.   This  option  addresses that issue by attempting to grab the filename from the last
              'Location:' tag in the output of 'wget --server-response'.

       <u>OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_MDATE</u>
              For feeds that use a singular filename for each  item  that  is  identified  by  a  long  somewhat
              incomprehensible  string  in  the URL.  These feeds were previously fixed with FILENAME_FORMATFIX4
              which would append the string to the common filename to produce unique filenames  for  each  item.
              However  this  produced  filenames  that  were  not very easy to understand.  This option gives us
              another method for dealing with these common filenames.  This appends the date of the  files  last
              change  (modification  date) as a prefix to the filename in the format of YYYYMMDD_HHhMMm_&lt;common-
              part&gt;.  This makes the filenames sortable and gives the  user  something  that  makes  a  moderate
              amount  of sense.  Does not work for all feeds, for some feeds the last modification time for each
              file is the time of download.  Which may be acceptable in some situations but can cause  confusion
              when downloading more than one item at a time from a feed.

       <u>OPT_WGET_DEFUSERAGENT</u>
              Configure Wget to use it's default user-agent (normally formatted similar to "Wget/1.21.2") and to
              not  use  either  Podget's default user-agent ("Podget") or a custom agent set in WGET_BASEOPTS in
              podgetrc.

       <u>OPT_NO_CERT_CHECK</u>
              Disable wget SSL certificate verification.  This is common used for feeds  that  are  using  self-
              signed certificates.

       <u>OPT_PREFER_IPv4</u> or <u>OPT_PREFER_IPv6</u>
              Configure  wget  so  that  when  a  DNS  lookup gives a choice of several addresses that it should
              connect to the specified family first.

       Examples:
        <a href="http://somesite.com/feed.rss">http://somesite.com/feed.rss</a> CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_PREFER_IPv4
        <a href="http://somesite.com/feed.rss">http://somesite.com/feed.rss</a> CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_PREFER_IPv6

       <b>RSS</b> <b>Feed</b> <b>Options:</b>
              There are three options for RSS Feeds that are not supported for ATOM feeds.

              The first two are related with the renaming the downloaded files with the contents of the  &lt;TITLE&gt;
              tag from the HTML and the third is to expand what tags Podget gets content from.

       <u>OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_TITLETAG</u>
              This  first  version  is for handling feeds that place the &lt;TITLE&gt; tag before the &lt;ENCLOSURE&gt; tag.
              The majority of tested feeds that use &lt;TITLE&gt; tags follow this order.

       <u>OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_REVTITLETAG</u>
              The second version is for handling feeds that have the  &lt;ENCLOSURE&gt;  tag  first  followed  by  the
              &lt;TITLE&gt; tag.

       <u>OPT_RSS_MEDIACONTENT</u>
              This  third option will enable Podget to download content from &lt;MEDIA:CONTENT&gt; tags in addition to
              &lt;ENCLOSURE&gt; tags.

       Examples:
        <a href="http://somesite.com/feed.rss">http://somesite.com/feed.rss</a> CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_TITLETAG
        <a href="http://somesite.com/feed.rss">http://somesite.com/feed.rss</a> CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_TITLETAG OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_MDATE
        <a href="http://somesite.com/feed.rss">http://somesite.com/feed.rss</a> CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_REVTITLETAG
        <a href="http://somesite.com/feed.rss">http://somesite.com/feed.rss</a> CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_RSS_MEDIACONTENT

       To determine if the feed uses &lt;TITLE&gt; tags and in which order, run the following with  the  URL  for  the
       feed:

               wget -O - <a href="http://somesite.com/feed.rss">http://somesite.com/feed.rss</a> | sed -n -e :a -e 's/.*&lt;enclosure.*url\s*=\s*"\([^"]+\)".*/URL 1/Ip' -e t -e "s/.*&lt;enclosure.*url\s*'=\s*\([^i]\+\)'.*/URL \1/Ip" -e t -e 's/.*&lt;title&gt;\(.*\)&lt;[/]title&gt;.*$/TITLE 1/Ip' -e t -e '/\(&lt;enclosure\|&lt;title&gt;\).*/I{N;s/ *0 /;T;ba}'

       This  will produce a list of lines that start with either TITLE or URL.  The  URL is from the &lt;ENCLOSURE&gt;
       tag and the TITLE is obviously from the &lt;TITLE&gt; tag.  On many feeds the first thing you will notice is  a
       few  uses of the &lt;TITLE&gt; tag before the first URL is specified.  In that case, Podget uses the last TITLE
       found, so the earlier ones are discard.  The important part is when we get to the first URL,  from  there
       we  need to determine if the title for that item came before or after the URL.  If it comes first then we
       use   OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_TITLETAG   for   it.    If   the   title   comes    second    then    we    use
       OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_REVTITLETAG.

       On  some feeds, the downloaded filename will not have anything identifiable to determine which TITLE goes
       with it.  In those cases it may be necessary to download a few items and  listen  to  them  to  determine
       which order they use.

       On  some  feeds,  it  will be discovered that the downloaded filename and the TITLE are very similar.  In
       those cases, it is left to the user to determine which they prefer.

       On some feeds, the TITLE will have very little to specify when it was recorded and it may  be  useful  to
       use the OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_MDATE option to add a date tag to each filename as it is converted.

       And  on  some  feeds, there will be a complete absence of TITLE lines.  Those feeds do not use the tag so
       using either option will not produce any changes.

       <b>Atom</b> <b>Feed</b> <b>Options:</b>
              The following options are available for advanced handling of Atom feeds.

       <u>ATOM_FILTER_SIMPLE</u>
              This option will enable filtering for just audio or video files from a feed.

       <u>ATOM_FILTER_TYPE="type"</u>
              This option allows more detailed filtering of the variety of types available.  This can limit  the
              files   downloaded   to   one   type   (example:   "audio/mpeg")  or  to  a  few  types  (example:
              "(audio|video)<a href="file:/.">/.</a>*" for all audio and video types, OR "audio/.*" for all audio types).

       <u>ATOM_FILTER_LANG="language"</u>
              If an Atom feed supports multiple languages for enclosures, then you can use this option to filter
              to only those you desire.  You can limit to one language  (example:  "en"  for  just  English)  or
              combine  several  supported  languages to get them all (example: "(en|es|fr)" to download files in
              English, Spanish and French.  How the languages are defined may vary from feed to feed.

       Note:  If you do not enable any of the ATOM_FILTER options on a feed with multiple enclosures  per  item,
       when  you  run  podget  it  will tell you the count per type or language to help you decide if you should
       enable the filters to reduce the number of files to be downloaded.

       Examples:
        <a href="http://somesite.com/feed">http://somesite.com/feed</a> CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_SIMPLE
        <a href="http://somesite.com/feed">http://somesite.com/feed</a> CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_TYPE="audio/mpeg"
        <a href="http://somesite.com/feed">http://somesite.com/feed</a> CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_TYPE="(audio|video)<a href="file:/.">/.</a>*"
        <a href="http://somesite.com/feed">http://somesite.com/feed</a> CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_LANG="en"
        <a href="http://somesite.com/feed">http://somesite.com/feed</a> CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_LANG="(en|es|fr)"
        <a href="http://somesite.com/feed">http://somesite.com/feed</a> CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_TYPE="audio/mpeg" ATOM_FILTER_LANG="en"

   <b>HANDLING</b> <b>UTF-16</b> <b>FEEDS</b>
       Some servers provide their feeds in UTF-16 format rather than the more common UTF-8.

       To automatically convert these files, create a secondary serverlist in your configuration directory:

               serverlist.utf16

       Remember to change the name of the serverlist to match what you set it to with config_serverlist  if  you
       changed it.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>CRON</b> <b>JOB</b></h4><pre>
       Once podget is running correctly, it's most useful if you run it from a cron job so that the new episodes
       are available to play or load onto a portable player and you don't have to wait for them to download.

       To edit your crontab, do:

         $ crontab -e

       Then add one line similar to this example:

         15 04 * * * /usr/bin/podget -s

       This will run podget at 4:15 AM every day.

       In  some  cases,  you  might  need to add a few directories to your PATH variable so that Podget can find
       everything it needs.

       Then the job might look like:

         15 04 * * * PATH=/opt/local/bin:<a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>:$PATH /usr/bin/podget -s

</pre><h4><b>INFORMATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DEBUG</b> <b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       Sometimes when you are running Podget, it is nice to get a bit more information about what  is  happening
       to  pinpoint  what  is causing a problem.  With that in mind, Podget makes it possible to display more of
       what is happening behind the scenes.

       For informational messages:

         $ INFO= podget

       INFO can be set to any value or none.  It just matters that the variable is set.

       By default any informational message line will be prefixed with 'INFO  --'.

       Debug messages get deeper into what is happening and are available in 5 levels.

       By default Debug messages are disabled and are the equivalent of running:

         $ DEBUG=0 podget

       Higher Debug levels can be enabled and include these options.

         $ DEBUG=1 podget

       Level 1 Debug includes:
       - Informational messages.
       - Debugging messages (by default prefixed with 'DEBUG --').

         $ DEBUG=2 podget

       Level 2 Debug includes:
       - Informational messages.
       - Debugging messages.
       - Enable Bash Shell option for xtrace.  The shell will print the expanded version  of  each  command  and
       arguments as they are run.

         $ DEBUG=3 podget

       Level 3 Debug includes:
       - Informational messages.
       - Debugging messages.
       - Enable Bash Shell option for xtrace.
       -  Enable  Bash Shell option for verbose.  This will cause the script to print each line as they are read
       without expanding anything.

         $ DEBUG=4 podget

       Level 4 Debug includes:
       - Informational messages.
       - Debugging messages.
       - Enable Bash Shell option for xtrace.
       - Enable Bash Shell option for functrace.  When enabled any traps on DEBUG and RETURN  are  inherited  by
       shell functions, command substitutions and subshells.
       - Enable Bash shell debug trap.  Podget uses a very simple debug trap that causes each line as it is read
       to be printed with the line number it is on.  This is effectively a slightly improved version of what the
       verbose option tells us.

   <b>Special</b> <b>Handling</b> <b>for</b> <b>Debug</b> <b>messages.</b>
       The  majority  of the output from Podget is set to the STDOUT stream.  However, when using Debug modes at
       level 2 or above, the additional messages are sent to the STDERR stream.  For most  uses,  this  is  just
       fine.   However  if  you wish to pipe the output to another command then it may be necessary to merge the
       two streams back together so they are displayed in the expected order.

       For example to pipe the output of Podget to less, you could run:

         $ DEBUG=2 podget 2&gt;&amp;1 | less
