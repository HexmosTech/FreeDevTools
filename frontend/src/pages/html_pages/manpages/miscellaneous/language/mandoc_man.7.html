</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       man — legacy formatting language for manual pages

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>man</b>  language was the standard formatting language for AT&amp;T UNIX manual pages from 1979 to 1989.  Do
       not use it to write new manual pages: it is a  purely  presentational  language  and  lacks  support  for
       semantic markup.  Use the <u><a href="../man7/mdoc.7.html">mdoc</a></u>(7) language, instead.

       In  a  <b>man</b>  document, lines beginning with the control character ‘.’ are called “macro lines”.  The first
       word is the macro name.  It usually consists of two capital letters.  For a list of portable macros,  see
       “MACRO OVERVIEW”.  The words following the macro name are arguments to the macro.

       Lines  not  beginning with the control character are called “text lines”.  They provide free-form text to
       be printed; the formatting of the text depends on the respective processing context:

             .SH Macro lines change control state.
             Text lines are interpreted within the current state.

       Many aspects of the basic syntax of the <b>man</b> language are based on the <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) language; see the  <u>LANGUAGE</u>
       <u>SYNTAX</u>  and  <u>MACRO</u>  <u>SYNTAX</u>  sections in the <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) manual for details, in particular regarding comments,
       escape sequences, whitespace, and quoting.

       Each <b>man</b> document starts with the <b>TH</b> macro specifying the document's name and section,  followed  by  the
       “NAME” section formatted as follows:

             .TH PROGNAME 1 1979-01-10
             .SH NAME
             \fBprogname\fR \(en one line about what it does

</pre><h4><b>MACRO</b> <b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       This  overview  is  sorted  such that macros of similar purpose are listed together.  Deprecated and non-
       portable macros are not included in the overview, but can be found in the alphabetical reference below.

       <b>RB</b>        alternate between roman and boldface fonts
       <b>RI</b>        alternate between roman and italic fonts

</pre><h4><b>MACRO</b> <b>REFERENCE</b></h4><pre>
       This section is a canonical reference to  all  macros,  arranged  alphabetically.   For  the  scoping  of
       individual macros, see “MACRO SYNTAX”.

       <b>AT</b>   Sets  the  volume  for  the  footer  for  compatibility with man pages from AT&amp;T UNIX releases.  The
            optional arguments specify which release it is from.  This macro is an extension that first appeared
            in 4.3BSD.

       <b>B</b>    Text is rendered in bold face.

       <b>BI</b>   Text is rendered alternately in bold face and italic.  Thus, ‘.BI this word and that’ causes  ‘this’
            and  ‘and’  to  render  in bold face, while ‘word’ and ‘that’ render in italics.  Whitespace between
            arguments is omitted in output.

            Example:

                  <b>.BI</b> <b>bold</b> <b>italic</b> <b>bold</b> <b>italic</b>

       <b>BR</b>   Text is rendered alternately in  bold  face  and  roman  (the  default  font).   Whitespace  between
            arguments is omitted in output.  See also <b>BI</b>.

       <b>DT</b>   Restore  the  default tabulator positions.  They are at intervals of 0.5 inches.  This has no effect
            unless the tabulator positions were changed with the <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) <b>ta</b> request.

       <b>EE</b>   This is a non-standard Version 9 AT&amp;T UNIX extension later adopted by GNU.  In  <u><a href="../man1/mandoc.1.html">mandoc</a></u>(1),  it  does
            the same as the <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) <b>fi</b> request (switch to fill mode).

       <b>EX</b>   This  is  a  non-standard Version 9 AT&amp;T UNIX extension later adopted by GNU.  In <u><a href="../man1/mandoc.1.html">mandoc</a></u>(1), it does
            the same as the <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) <b>nf</b> request (switch to no-fill mode).

       <b>HP</b>   Begin a paragraph whose initial output line is  left-justified,  but  subsequent  output  lines  are
            indented, with the following syntax:

                  .<b>HP</b> [<u>width</u>]

            The  <u>width</u>  argument  is a <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) scaling width.  If specified, it's saved for later paragraph left
            margins; if unspecified, the saved or default width is used.

            This macro is portable, but deprecated because it has no good representation in HTML output, usually
            ending up indistinguishable from <b>PP</b>.

       <b>I</b>    Text is rendered in italics.

       <b>IB</b>   Text is rendered alternately in italics and bold face.  Whitespace between arguments is  omitted  in
            output.  See also <b>BI</b>.

       <b>IP</b>   Begin an indented paragraph with the following syntax:

                  .<b>IP</b> [<u>head</u> [<u>width</u>]]

            The  <u>width</u>  argument  is  a  <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7)  scaling  width defining the left margin.  It's saved for later
            paragraph left-margins; if unspecified, the saved or default width is used.

            The <u>head</u> argument is used as a leading term, flushed  to  the  left  margin.   This  is  useful  for
            bulleted paragraphs and so on.

       <b>IR</b>   Text  is rendered alternately in italics and roman (the default font).  Whitespace between arguments
            is omitted in output.  See also <b>BI</b>.

       <b>LP</b>   A synonym for <b>PP</b>.

       <b>ME</b>   End a mailto block started with <b>MT</b>.  This is a non-standard GNU extension.

       <b>MT</b>   Begin a mailto block.  This is a non-standard GNU extension.  It has the following syntax:

                  .<b>MT</b> <u>address</u>
                  link description to be shown
                  .<b>ME</b>

       <b>OP</b>   Optional command-line argument.  This is a non-standard DWB extension.  It has the following syntax:

                  .<b>OP</b> <u>key</u> [<u>value</u>]

            The <u>key</u> is usually a command-line flag and <u>value</u> its argument.

       <b>P</b>    This synonym for <b>PP</b> is an AT&amp;T System III UNIX extension later adopted by 4.3BSD.

       <b>PD</b>   Specify the vertical space to be inserted before each new paragraph.
            The syntax is as follows:

                  .<b>PD</b> [<u>height</u>]

            The <u>height</u> argument is a <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) scaling width.  It defaults to <b>1v</b>.  If the unit is  omitted,  <b>v</b>  is
            assumed.

            This macro affects the spacing before any subsequent instances of <b>HP</b>, <b>IP</b>, <b>LP</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>PP</b>, <b>SH</b>, <b>SS</b>, <b>SY</b>, and
            <b>TP</b>.

       <b>PP</b>   Begin  an undecorated paragraph.  The scope of a paragraph is closed by a subsequent paragraph, sub-
            section, section, or end of file.  The saved paragraph left-margin width is reset to the default.

       <b>RB</b>   Text is rendered alternately in  roman  (the  default  font)  and  bold  face.   Whitespace  between
            arguments is omitted in output.  See also <b>BI</b>.

       <b>RE</b>   Explicitly  close  out  the  scope  of a prior <b>RS</b>.  The default left margin is restored to the state
            before that <b>RS</b> invocation.

            The syntax is as follows:

                  .<b>RE</b> [<u>level</u>]

            Without an argument, the most recent <b>RS</b> block is closed out.  If <u>level</u> is 1, all open <b>RS</b> blocks  are
            closed out.  Otherwise, <u>level</u> − 1 nested <b>RS</b> blocks remain open.

       <b>RI</b>   Text  is rendered alternately in roman (the default font) and italics.  Whitespace between arguments
            is omitted in output.  See also <b>BI</b>.

       <b>RS</b>   Temporarily reset the default left margin.  This has the following syntax:

                  .<b>RS</b> [<u>width</u>]

            The <u>width</u> argument is a <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) scaling width.  If not specified, the  saved  or  default  width  is
            used.

            See also <b>RE</b>.

       <b>SB</b>   Text  is  rendered in small size (one point smaller than the default font) bold face.  This macro is
            an extension that probably first appeared in SunOS 4.0 and was later adopted by GNU and by 4.4BSD.

       <b>SH</b>   Begin a section.  The scope of a section is only closed by another section or the end of file.   The
            paragraph left-margin width is reset to the default.

       <b>SM</b>   Text is rendered in small size (one point smaller than the default font).

       <b>SS</b>   Begin  a sub-section.  The scope of a sub-section is closed by a subsequent sub-section, section, or
            end of file.  The paragraph left-margin width is reset to the default.

       <b>SY</b>   Begin a synopsis block with the following syntax:

                  .<b>SY</b> <u>command</u>
                  <u>arguments</u>
                  .<b>YS</b>

            This is a non-standard GNU extension and very rarely used even in GNU manual pages.   Formatting  is
            similar to <b>IP</b>.

       <b>TH</b>   Set the name of the manual page for use in the page header and footer with the following syntax:

                  .<b>TH</b> <u>name</u> <u>section</u> <u>date</u> [<u>source</u> [<u>volume</u>]]

            Conventionally, the document <u>name</u> is given in all caps.  The <u>section</u> is usually a single digit, in a
            few  cases  followed  by  a  letter.   The recommended <u>date</u> format is <b>YYYY-MM-DD</b> as specified in the
            ISO-8601 standard; if the argument does not conform, it is printed verbatim.  If the <u>date</u>  is  empty
            or  not  specified, the current date is used.  The optional <u>source</u> string specifies the organisation
            providing the utility.  When unspecified, <u><a href="../man1/mandoc.1.html">mandoc</a></u>(1) uses  its  <b>-Ios</b>  argument.   The  <u>volume</u>  string
            replaces the default volume title of the <u>section</u>.

            Examples:

                  <b>.TH</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>5</b> <b>1992-02-12</b> <b>GNU</b>

       <b>TP</b>   Begin  a  paragraph where the head, if exceeding the indentation width, is followed by a newline; if
            not, the body follows on the same line after advancing to the indentation width.  Subsequent  output
            lines are indented.  The syntax is as follows:

                  .<b>TP</b> [<u>width</u>]
                  <u>head</u> \" one line
                  <u>body</u>

            The  <u>width</u>  argument is a <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) scaling width.  If specified, it's saved for later paragraph left-
            margins; if unspecified, the saved or default width is used.

       <b>TQ</b>   Like <b>TP</b>, except that no vertical spacing is inserted before the paragraph.  This is  a  non-standard
            GNU extension and very rarely used even in GNU manual pages.

       <b>UC</b>   Sets  the  volume  for  the footer for compatibility with man pages from BSD releases.  The optional
            first argument specifies which release it is from.  This macro is an extension that  first  appeared
            in 3BSD.

       <b>UE</b>   End a uniform resource identifier block started with <b>UR</b>.  This is a non-standard GNU extension.

       <b>UR</b>   Begin  a  uniform  resource  identifier  block.   This  is a non-standard GNU extension.  It has the
            following syntax:

                  .<b>UR</b> <u>uri</u>
                  link description to be shown
                  .<b>UE</b>

       <b>YS</b>   End a synopsis block started with <b>SY</b>.  This is a non-standard GNU extension.

       <b>in</b>   Indent relative to the current indentation:

                  .<b>in</b> [<u>width</u>]

            If <u>width</u> is signed, the new offset is relative.  Otherwise, it is absolute.   This  value  is  reset
            upon the next paragraph, section, or sub-section.

</pre><h4><b>MACRO</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>man</b>  macros  are classified by scope: line scope or block scope.  Line macros are only scoped to the
       current line (and, in some situations, the subsequent line).  Block macros are scoped to the current line
       and subsequent lines until closed by another block macro.

   <b>Line</b> <b>Macros</b>
       Line macros are generally scoped to the current line, with the body consisting of zero or more arguments.
       If a macro is scoped to the next line and the line arguments are empty, the  next  line,  which  must  be
       text, is used instead.  Thus:

             .I
             foo

       is  equivalent  to ‘.I foo’.  If next-line macros are invoked consecutively, only the last is used.  If a
       next-line macro is followed by a non-next-line macro, an error is raised.

       The syntax is as follows:

             .YO [body...]
             [body...]

   <b>Block</b> <b>Macros</b>
       Block macros comprise a head and body.  As with in-line macros, the head is scoped to  the  current  line
       and,  in  one  circumstance,  the next line (the next-line stipulations as in “Line Macros” apply here as
       well).

       The syntax is as follows:

             .YO [head...]
             [head...]
             [body...]

       The closure of body scope may be to the section, where a macro is closed by <b>SH</b>; sub-section, closed by  a
       section  or  <b>SS</b>;  or  paragraph,  closed by a section, sub-section, <b>HP</b>, <b>IP</b>, <b>LP</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>PP</b>, <b>RE</b>, <b>SY</b>, or <b>TP</b>.  No
       closure refers to an explicit block closing macro.

       As a rule, block macros may not be nested; thus, calling a block macro while another block macro scope is
       open, and the open scope is not implicitly closed, is syntactically incorrect.

       If a block macro is next-line scoped, it may only be followed by in-line macros for decorating text.

   <b>Font</b> <b>handling</b>
       In <b>man</b> documents, both “Physical markup” macros and <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) ‘\f’ font escape sequences  can  be  used  to
       choose  fonts.   In  text lines, the effect of manual font selection by escape sequences only lasts until
       the next macro invocation; in macro lines, it only lasts until the end of the  macro  scope.   Note  that
       macros like <b>BR</b> open and close a font scope for each argument.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>man</b>  language  first  appeared  as a macro package for the roff typesetting system in Version 7 AT&amp;T
       UNIX.

       The stand-alone implementation that is part of the <u><a href="../man1/mandoc.1.html">mandoc</a></u>(1) utility first appeared in OpenBSD 4.6.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       Douglas McIlroy &lt;<u><a href="mailto:m.douglas.mcilroy@dartmouth.edu">m.douglas.mcilroy@dartmouth.edu</a></u>&gt; designed and implemented the original version of  these
       macros,  wrote  the  original  version  of this manual page, and was the first to use them when he edited
       volume 1 of the Version 7 AT&amp;T UNIX manual pages.

       James Clark later rewrote the macros for groff.  Eric S. Raymond  &lt;<u><a href="mailto:esr@thyrsus.com">esr@thyrsus.com</a></u>&gt;  and  Werner  Lemberg
       &lt;<u><a href="mailto:wl@gnu.org">wl@gnu.org</a></u>&gt; added the extended <b>man</b> macros to groff in 2007.

       The <u><a href="../man1/mandoc.1.html">mandoc</a></u>(1) program and this <b>man</b> reference were written by Kristaps Dzonsons &lt;<u><a href="mailto:kristaps@bsd.lv">kristaps@bsd.lv</a></u>&gt;.
