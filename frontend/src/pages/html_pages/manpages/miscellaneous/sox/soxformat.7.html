</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SoX - Sound eXchange, the Swiss Army knife of audio manipulation

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  describes SoX supported file formats and audio device types; the SoX manual set starts with
       <b><a href="../man1/sox.1.html">sox</a></b>(1).

       Format types that can SoX can determine by a filename extension are listed with their names preceded by a
       dot.  Format types that are optionally built into SoX are marked `(optional)'.

       Format types that can be handled by an external library via  an  optional  pseudo  file  type  (currently
       <b>sndfile</b>)  are marked e.g. `(also with <b>-t</b> <b>sndfile</b>)'.  This might be useful if you have a file that doesn't
       work with SoX's default format readers and writers, and there's an external reader  or  writer  for  that
       format.

       To  see if SoX has support for an optional format or device, enter <b>sox</b> <b>-h</b> and look for its name under the
       list: `AUDIO FILE FORMATS' or `AUDIO DEVICE DRIVERS'.

   <b>SOX</b> <b>FORMATS</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>DRIVERS</b>
       <b>.raw</b> (also with <b>-t</b> <b>sndfile</b>), <b>.f32</b>, <b>.f64</b>, <b>.s8</b>, <b>.s16</b>, <b>.s24</b>, <b>.s32</b>,
       <b>.u8</b>, <b>.u16</b>, <b>.u24</b>, <b>.u32</b>, <b>.ul</b>, <b>.al</b>, <b>.lu</b>, <b>.la</b>
              Raw (headerless) audio files.  For <b>raw</b>, the sample rate and the data encoding must be given  using
              command-line format options; for the other listed types, the sample rate defaults to 8kHz (but may
              be  overridden),  and the data encoding is defined by the given suffix.  Thus <b>f32</b> and <b>f64</b> indicate
              files encoded as 32 and 64-bit (IEEE single and double precision) floating point PCM respectively;
              <b>s8</b>, <b>s16</b>, <b>s24</b>, and <b>s32</b> indicate 8, 16, 24, and 32-bit signed integer  PCM  respectively;  <b>u8</b>,  <b>u16</b>,
              <b>u24</b>,  and  <b>u32</b>  indicate  8,  16,  24,  and 32-bit unsigned integer PCM respectively; <b>ul</b> indicates
              `μ-law' (8-bit), <b>al</b> indicates `A-law' (8-bit), and <b>lu</b> and <b>la</b> are inverse  bit  order  `μ-law'  and
              inverse bit order `A-law' respectively.  For all raw formats, the number of channels defaults to 1
              (but may be overridden).

              Headerless  audio  files  on  a  SPARC  computer are likely to be of format <b>ul</b>;  on a Mac, they're
              likely to be <b>u8</b> but with a sample rate of 11025 or 22050 Hz.

              See <b>.ima</b> and <b>.vox</b> for raw ADPCM formats, and <b>.cdda</b> for raw CD digital audio.

       <b>.f4</b>, <b>.f8</b>, <b>.s1</b>, <b>.s2</b>, <b>.s3</b>, <b>.s4</b>,
       <b>.u1</b>, <b>.u2</b>, <b>.u3</b>, <b>.u4</b>, <b>.sb</b>, <b>.sw</b>, <b>.sl</b>, <b>.ub</b>, <b>.uw</b>
              Deprecated aliases for <b>f32</b>, <b>f64</b>, <b>s8</b>, <b>s16</b>, <b>s24</b>, <b>s32</b>,
              <b>u8</b>, <b>u16</b>, <b>u24</b>, <b>u32</b>, <b>s8</b>, <b>s16</b>, <b>s32</b>, <b>u8</b>, and <b>u16</b> respectively.

       <b>.8svx</b> (also with <b>-t</b> <b>sndfile</b>)
              Amiga 8SVX musical instrument description format.

       <b>.aiff</b>, <b>.aif</b> (also with <b>-t</b> <b>sndfile</b>)
              AIFF files as used on old Apple Macs, Apple IIc/IIgs and SGI.  SoX's AIFF support does not include
              multiple audio chunks, or  the  8SVX  musical  instrument  description  format.   AIFF  files  are
              multimedia  archives  and  can  have  multiple  audio and picture chunks - you may need a separate
              archiver to work with them.  With Mac OS X, AIFF has been superseded by CAF.

       <b>.aiffc</b>, <b>.aifc</b> (also with <b>-t</b> <b>sndfile</b>)
              AIFF-C is a format based on AIFF that was created to allow handling compressed audio.  It can also
              handle little endian uncompressed linear data that is often referred to as  <b>sowt</b>  encoding.   This
              encoding  has  also  become  the  defacto  format produced by modern Macs as well as iTunes on any
              platform.  AIFF-C files produced by other applications typically have the file extension .aif  and
              require  looking  at its header to detect the true format.  The <b>sowt</b> encoding is the only encoding
              that SoX can handle with this format.

              AIFF-C is defined in DAVIC 1.4 Part 9 Annex B.  This format is referred from ARIB  STD-B24,  which
              is specified for Japanese data broadcasting.  Any private chunks are not supported.

       <b>alsa</b> (optional)
              Advanced  Linux Sound Architecture device driver; supports both playing and recording audio.  ALSA
              is only used in Linux-based operating systems, though these often support OSS (see below) as well.
              Examples:
                   sox infile -t alsa
                   sox infile -t alsa default
                   sox infile -t alsa plughw:0,0
                   sox -b 16 -t alsa hw:1 outfile
              See also <b><a href="../man1/play.1.html">play</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/rec.1.html">rec</a></b>(1), and <b><a href="../man1/sox.1.html">sox</a></b>(1) <b>-d</b>.

       <b>.amb</b>   Ambisonic B-Format: a specialisation of <b>.wav</b> with between 3 and 16 channels of audio for use  with
              an  Ambisonic  decoder.   See <a href="http://www.ambisonia.com/Members/mleese/file-format-for-b-format">http://www.ambisonia.com/Members/mleese/file-format-for-b-format</a> for
              details.  It is up to the user to get the channels together in the right order and at the  correct
              amplitude.

       <b>.amr-nb</b> (optional)
              Adaptive  Multi  Rate  -  Narrow  Band  speech codec; a lossy format used in 3rd generation mobile
              telephony and defined in 3GPP TS 26.071 et al.

              AMR-NB audio has a fixed sampling rate of 8 kHz and supports encoding to the  following  bit-rates
              (as  selected by the <b>-C</b> option): 0 = 4.75 kbit/s, 1 = 5.15 kbit/s, 2 = 5.9 kbit/s, 3 = 6.7 kbit/s,
              4 = 7.4 kbit/s 5 = 7.95 kbit/s, 6 = 10.2 kbit/s, 7 = 12.2 kbit/s.

       <b>.amr-wb</b> (optional)
              Adaptive Multi Rate - Wide Band speech codec;  a  lossy  format  used  in  3rd  generation  mobile
              telephony and defined in 3GPP TS 26.171 et al.

              AMR-WB  audio has a fixed sampling rate of 16 kHz and supports encoding to the following bit-rates
              (as selected by the <b>-C</b> option): 0 = 6.6 kbit/s, 1 = 8.85 kbit/s, 2  =  12.65  kbit/s,  3  =  14.25
              kbit/s, 4 = 15.85 kbit/s 5 = 18.25 kbit/s, 6 = 19.85 kbit/s, 7 = 23.05 kbit/s, 8 = 23.85 kbit/s.

       <b>ao</b> (optional)
              Xiph.org's  Audio Output device driver; works only for playing audio.  It supports a wide range of
              devices and sound systems - see its documentation for the full range.  For the  most  part,  SoX's
              use of libao cannot be configured directly; instead, libao configuration files must be used.

              The  filename  specified  is  used  to  determine which libao plugin to use.  Normally, you should
              specify `default' as the filename.  If that doesn't give the desired behavior then you can specify
              the short name for a given plugin (such as <b>pulse</b> for pulse audio plugin).  Examples:
                   sox infile -t ao
                   sox infile -t ao default
                   sox infile -t ao pulse
              See also <b><a href="../man1/play.1.html">play</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/sox.1.html">sox</a></b>(1) <b>-d</b>.

       <b>.au</b>, <b>.snd</b> (also with <b>-t</b> <b>sndfile</b>)
              Sun Microsystems AU files.  There are many types of AU file; DEC  has  invented  its  own  with  a
              different  magic  number  and  byte order.  To write a DEC file, use the <b>-L</b> option with the output
              file options.

              Some .au files are known to have invalid AU headers; these are probably original Sun μ-law 8000 Hz
              files and can be dealt with using the <b>.ul</b> format (see below).

              It is possible to override AU file header information with the <b>-r</b> and <b>-c</b> options,  in  which  case
              SoX will issue a warning to that effect.

       <b>.avr</b>   Audio Visual Research format; used by a number of commercial packages on the Mac.

       <b>.caf</b> (optional)
              Apple's Core Audio File format.

       <b>.cdda</b>, <b>.cdr</b>
              `Red  Book'  Compact  Disc  Digital  Audio  (raw audio).  CDDA has two audio channels formatted as
              16-bit signed integers (big endian)at a sample rate of 44.1 kHz.  The number of  (stereo)  samples
              in each CDDA track is always a multiple of 588.

       <b>coreaudio</b> (optional)
              Mac  OSX CoreAudio device driver: supports both playing and recording audio.  If a filename is not
              specific or if the name is "default" then the default audio device is selected.   Any  other  name
              will  be  used  to  select  a  specific  device.   The  valid  names  can  be  seen  in the System
              Preferences-&gt;Sound menu and then under the Output and Input tabs.

              Examples:
                   sox infile -t coreaudio
                   sox infile -t coreaudio default
                   sox infile -t coreaudio "Internal Speakers"
              See also <b><a href="../man1/play.1.html">play</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/rec.1.html">rec</a></b>(1), and <b><a href="../man1/sox.1.html">sox</a></b>(1) <b>-d</b>.

       <b>.cvsd</b>, <b>.cvs</b>
              Continuously Variable Slope Delta modulation.  A headerless format used to compress  speech  audio
              for  applications  such  as voice mail.  This format is sometimes used with bit-reversed samples -
              the <b>-X</b> format option can be used to set the bit-order.

       <b>.cvu</b>   Continuously Variable Slope Delta modulation (unfiltered).  This is  an  alternative  handler  for
              CVSD that is unfiltered but can be used with any bit-rate.  E.g.
                   sox infile outfile.cvu rate 28k
                   play -r 28k outfile.cvu sinc -3.4k

       <b>.dat</b>   Text  Data  files.  These files contain a textual representation of the sample data.  There is one
              line at the beginning that contains the sample rate, and one line  that  contains  the  number  of
              channels.   Subsequent lines contain two or more numeric data intems: the time since the beginning
              of the first sample and the sample value for each channel.

              Values are normalized so that the maximum and minimum are 1 and -1.  This file format can be  used
              to  create data files for external programs such as FFT analysers or graph routines.  SoX can also
              convert a file in this format back into one of the other file formats.

              Example containing only 2 stereo samples of silence:

                  ; Sample Rate 8012
                  ; Channels 2
                              0    0    0
                  0.00012481278  0    0

       <b>.dvms</b>, <b>.vms</b>
              Used in Germany to compress speech audio for voice mail.  A self-describing variant of <b>cvsd</b>.

       <b>.fap</b> (optional)
              See <b>.paf</b>.

       <b>.flac</b> (optional; also with <b>-t</b> <b>sndfile</b>)
              Xiph.org's Free Lossless Audio CODEC  compressed  audio.   FLAC  is  an  open,  patent-free  CODEC
              designed  for  compressing music.  It is similar to MP3 and Ogg Vorbis, but lossless, meaning that
              audio is compressed in FLAC without any loss in quality.

              SoX can read native FLAC files (.flac) but not Ogg FLAC files (.ogg).  [But  see  <b>.ogg</b>  below  for
              information relating to support for Ogg Vorbis files.]

              SoX  can  write  native  FLAC  files  according to a given or default compression level.  8 is the
              default compression level and gives the best (but slowest) compression; 0  gives  the  least  (but
              fastest)  compression.   The compression level is selected using the <b>-C</b> option [see <b><a href="../man1/sox.1.html">sox</a></b>(1)] with a
              whole number from 0 to 8.

       <b>.fssd</b>  An alias for the <b>.u8</b> format.

       <b>.gsrt</b>  Grandstream ring-tone files.  Whilst this file format can contain A-Law, μ-law, GSM, G.722, G.723,
              G.726, G.728, or iLBC encoded audio, SoX supports reading and writing only A-Law and μ-law.  E.g.
                 sox music.wav -t gsrt ring.bin
                 play ring.bin

       <b>.gsm</b> (optional; also with <b>-t</b> <b>sndfile</b>)
              GSM 06.10 Lossy Speech Compression.  A lossy format for compressing speech which is  used  in  the
              Global  Standard  for Mobile telecommunications (GSM).  It's good for its purpose, shrinking audio
              data size, but it will introduce lots of noise when a given audio signal is  encoded  and  decoded
              multiple times.  This format is used by some voice mail applications.  It is rather CPU intensive.

       <b>.hcom</b>  Macintosh HCOM files.  These are Mac FSSD files with Huffman compression.

       <b>.htk</b>   Single  channel  16-bit  PCM format used by HTK, a toolkit for building Hidden Markov Model speech
              processing tools.

       <b>.ircam</b> (also with <b>-t</b> <b>sndfile</b>)
              Another name for <b>.sf</b>.

       <b>.ima</b> (also with <b>-t</b> <b>sndfile</b>)
              A headerless file of IMA ADPCM audio data. IMA ADPCM claims 16-bit precision packed  into  only  4
              bits, but in fact sounds no better than <b>.vox</b>.

       <b>.lpc</b>, <b>.lpc10</b>
              LPC-10   is   a   compression   scheme   for   speech   developed   in   the  United  States.  See
              <a href="http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~jaf/lpc/">http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~jaf/lpc/</a> for details. There is  no  associated  file  format,  so  SoX's
              implementation is headerless.

       <b>.mat</b>, <b>.mat4</b>, <b>.mat5</b> (optional)
              Matlab 4.2/5.0 (respectively GNU Octave 2.0/2.1) format (.mat is the same as .mat4).

       <b>.m3u</b>   A  <u>playlist</u> format; contains a list of audio files.  SoX can read, but not write this file format.
              See [1] for details of this format.

       <b>.maud</b>  An IFF-conforming audio file type, registered by MS MacroSystem  Computer  GmbH,  published  along
              with  the  `Toccata'  sound-card  on the Amiga.  Allows 8bit linear, 16bit linear, A-Law, μ-law in
              mono and stereo.

       <b>.mp3</b>, <b>.mp2</b> (optional read, optional write)
              MP3 compressed audio; MP3 (MPEG Layer 3) is a part of the  patent-encumbered  MPEG  standards  for
              audio  and  video  compression.   It  is a lossy compression format that achieves good compression
              rates with little quality loss.

              Because MP3 is patented, SoX cannot be distributed with MP3 support without incurring  the  patent
              holder's  fees.   Users who require SoX with MP3 support must currently compile and build SoX with
              the MP3 libraries (LAME &amp; MAD) from source code, or, in some cases, obtain  pre-built  dynamically
              loadable libraries.

              When  reading MP3 files, up to 28 bits of precision is stored although only 16 bits is reported to
              user.  This is to allow default behavior of writing 16 bit output files.  A  user  can  specify  a
              higher  precision for the output file to prevent lossing this extra information.  MP3 output files
              will use up to 24 bits of precision while encoding.

              MP3 compression parameters can be selected using SoX's <b>-C</b> option as follows (note that the current
              syntax is subject to change):

              The primary parameter to the LAME encoder is the bit rate. If the value  of  the  <b>-C</b>  value  is  a
              positive integer, it's taken as the bitrate in kbps (e.g. if you specify 128, it uses 128 kbps).

              The  second  most  important  parameter  is  probably "quality" (really performance), which allows
              balancing encoding speed vs. quality.  In LAME, 0 specifies highest  quality  but  is  very  slow,
              while 9 selects poor quality, but is fast. (5 is the default and 2 is recommended as a good trade-
              off for high quality encodes.)

              Because  the <b>-C</b> value is a float, the fractional part is used to select quality. 128.2 selects 128
              kbps encoding with a quality of 2. There is one problem with this approach. We need 128 to specify
              128 kbps encoding with default quality, so 0 means use default. Instead of 0 you have to  use  .01
              (or .99) to specify the highest quality (128.01 or 128.99).

              LAME uses bitrate to specify a constant bitrate, but higher quality can be achieved using Variable
              Bit Rate (VBR). VBR quality (really size) is selected using a number from 0 to 9. Use a value of 0
              for high quality, larger files, and 9 for smaller files of lower quality. 4 is the default.

              In  order  to  squeeze the selection of VBR into the the <b>-C</b> value float we use negative numbers to
              select VRR. -4.2 would select default VBR encoding (size) with high quality (speed).  One  special
              case  is 0, which is a valid VBR encoding parameter but not a valid bitrate.  Compression value of
              0 is always treated as a high quality vbr, as a result both -0.2 and 0.2 are  treated  as  highest
              quality VBR (size) and high quality (speed).

              See also <b>Ogg</b> <b>Vorbis</b> for a similar format.

              streaming audio.  It is a lossy compression format (similar to MP3, VQF &amp; AAC) that achieves  good
              compression rates with a minimum amount of quality loss.

              SoX  can  decode  all  types  of  Ogg  Vorbis  files,  and  can  encode  at  different compression
              levels/qualities given as a number from -1 (highest  compression/lowest  quality)  to  10  (lowest
              compression, highest quality).  By default the encoding quality level is 3 (which gives an encoded
              rate  of  approx.  112kbps), but this can be changed using the <b>-C</b> option (see above) with a number
              from -1 to 10; fractional numbers  (e.g.   3.6)  are  also  allowed.   Decoding  is  somewhat  CPU
              intensive and encoding is very CPU intensive.

              See also <b>.mp3</b> for a similar format.

       <b>.opus</b> (optional)
              Xiph.org's  Opus  compressed  audio;  an  open,  lossy, low-latency codec offering a wide range of
              compression rates. It uses the Ogg container.

              SoX can only read Opus files, not write them.

       <b>oss</b> (optional)
              Open Sound System /dev/dsp device driver; supports both playing and recording audio.  OSS  support
              is  available  in  Unix-like  operating systems, sometimes together with alternative sound systems
              (such as ALSA).  Examples:
                   sox infile -t oss
                   sox infile -t oss /dev/dsp
                   sox -b 16 -t oss /dev/dsp outfile
              See also <b><a href="../man1/play.1.html">play</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/rec.1.html">rec</a></b>(1), and <b><a href="../man1/sox.1.html">sox</a></b>(1) <b>-d</b>.

       <b>.paf</b>, <b>.fap</b> (optional)
              Ensoniq PARIS file format (big and little-endian respectively).

       <b>.pls</b>   A <u>playlist</u> format; contains a list of audio files.  SoX can read, but not write this file  format.
              See [2] for details of this format.

              Note:  SoX  support  for  SHOUTcast  PLS  relies  on <b><a href="../man1/wget.1.html">wget</a></b>(1) and is only partially supported: it's
              necessary to specify the audio type manually, e.g.
                   play -t mp3 "<a href="http://a.server/pls">http://a.server/pls</a>?rn=265&amp;file=filename.pls"
              and SoX does not know about alternative servers - hit Ctrl-C twice in quick succession to quit.

       <b>.prc</b>   Psion Record. Used in Psion EPOC  PDAs  (Series  5,  Revo  and  similar)  for  System  alarms  and
              recordings made by the built-in Record application.  When writing, SoX defaults to A-law, which is
              recommended;  if  you  must use ADPCM, then use the <b>-e</b> <b>ima-adpcm</b> switch. The sound quality is poor
              because Psion Record seems to insist on frames of 800 samples or fewer, so that  the  ADPCM  CODEC
              has to be reset at every 800 frames, which causes the sound to glitch every tenth of a second.

       <b>pulseaudio</b> (optional)
              PulseAudio  driver;  supports both playing and recording of audio.  PulseAudio is a cross platform
              networked sound server.  If a file name is specified with this driver, it is ignored.  Examples:
                   sox infile -t pulseaudio
                   sox infile -t pulseaudio default
              See also <b><a href="../man1/play.1.html">play</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/rec.1.html">rec</a></b>(1), and <b><a href="../man1/sox.1.html">sox</a></b>(1) <b>-d</b>.

       <b>.pvf</b> (optional)
              Portable Voice Format.

       <b>.sd2</b> (optional)
              Sound Designer 2 format.

       <b>.sds</b> (optional)
              MIDI Sample Dump Standard.

       <b>.sf</b> (also with <b>-t</b> <b>sndfile</b>)
              IRCAM SDIF (Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique Sound Description Interchange
              Format). Used by academic music software such as the CSound package, and the MixView sound  sample
              editor.

       <b>.sln</b>   Asterisk PBX `signed linear' 8khz, 16-bit signed integer, little-endian raw format.

       <b>.sph</b>, <b>.nist</b> (also with <b>-t</b> <b>sndfile</b>)
              SPHERE (SPeech HEader Resources) is a file format defined by NIST (National Institute of Standards
              and  Technology)  and is used with speech audio.  SoX can read these files when they contain μ-law
              and PCM data.  It will ignore any header information  that  says  the  data  is  compressed  using
              <u>shorten</u>  compression  and will treat the data as either μ-law or PCM.  This will allow SoX and the
              command line <u>shorten</u> program to be run together using pipes to encompasses the data and then  pass
              the result to SoX for processing.

       <b>.smp</b>   Turtle  Beach  SampleVision  files.  SMP files are for use with the PC-DOS package SampleVision by
              Turtle Beach Softworks.  This package is for communication to several MIDI samplers.   All  sample
              rates  are  supported  by  the package, although not all are supported by the samplers themselves.
              Currently loop points are ignored.

       <b>.snd</b>   See <b>.au</b>, <b>.sndr</b> and <b>.sndt</b>.

       <b>sndfile</b> (optional)
              This is a pseudo-type that forces libsndfile to be used. For writing files, the actual  file  type
              is then taken from the output file name; for reading them, it is deduced from the file.

       <b>sndio</b> (optional)
              OpenBSD audio device driver; supports both playing and recording audio.
                   sox infile -t sndio
              See also <b><a href="../man1/play.1.html">play</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/rec.1.html">rec</a></b>(1), and <b><a href="../man1/sox.1.html">sox</a></b>(1) <b>-d</b>.

       <b>.sndr</b>  Sounder  files.   An  MS-DOS/Windows  format  from the early '90s.  Sounder files usually have the
              extension `.SND'.

       <b>.sndt</b>  SoundTool files.  An MS-DOS/Windows format from the early '90s.  SoundTool files usually have  the
              extension `.SND'.

       <b>.sou</b>   An alias for the <b>.u8</b> raw format.

       <b>.sox</b>   SoX's  native  uncompressed  PCM  format,  intended  for storing (or piping) audio at intermediate
              processing points (i.e. between SoX invocations).  It has much in common  with  the  popular  WAV,
              AIFF,  and  AU  uncompressed  PCM formats, but has the following specific characteristics: the PCM
              samples are always stored as 32 bit signed integers,  the  samples  are  stored  (by  default)  as
              `native  endian', and the number of samples in the file is recorded as a 64-bit integer.  Comments
              are also supported.

              See `Special Filenames' in <b><a href="../man1/sox.1.html">sox</a></b>(1) for examples of using the <b>.sox</b> format with `pipes'.

       <b>sunau</b> (optional)
              Sun /dev/audio device driver; supports both playing and recording audio.  For example:
                   sox infile -t sunau /dev/audio
              or
                   sox infile -t sunau -e mu-law -c 1 /dev/audio
              for older sun equipment.

       <b>.txw</b>   Yamaha TX-16W sampler.  A file format from a Yamaha sampling keyboard which  wrote  IBM-PC  format
              3.5" floppies.  Handles reading of files which do not have the sample rate field set to one of the
              expected by looking at some other bytes in the attack/loop length fields, and defaulting to 33 kHz
              if the sample rate is still unknown.

       <b>.vms</b>   See <b>.dvms</b>.

       <b>.voc</b> (also with <b>-t</b> <b>sndfile</b>)
              Sound  Blaster  VOC  files.   VOC  files  are  multi-part  and contain silence parts, looping, and
              different sample rates for different chunks.  On input, the silence parts are  filled  out,  loops
              are rejected, and sample data with a new sample rate is rejected.  Silence with a different sample
              rate  is  generated  appropriately.  On output, silence is not detected, nor are impossible sample
              rates.  SoX supports reading  (but  not  writing)  VOC  files  with  multiple  blocks,  and  files
              containing μ-law, A-law, and 2/3/4-bit ADPCM samples.

       <b>.vorbis</b>
              See <b>.ogg</b>.

       <b>.vox</b> (also with <b>-t</b> <b>sndfile</b>)
              A  headerless  file of Dialogic/OKI ADPCM audio data commonly comes with the extension .vox.  This
              ADPCM data has 12-bit precision packed into only 4-bits.

              Note: some early Dialogic hardware does not always reset the ADPCM encoder at the  start  of  each
              vox  file.   This  can  result in clipping and/or DC offset problems when it comes to decoding the
              audio.  Whilst little can be done about the clipping, a DC offset can be removed  by  passing  the
              decoded audio through a high-pass filter, e.g.:
                   sox input.vox output.wav highpass 10

       <b>.w64</b> (optional)
              Sonic Foundry's 64-bit RIFF/WAV format.

       <b>.wav</b> (also with <b>-t</b> <b>sndfile</b>)
              Microsoft  .WAV  RIFF files.  This is the native audio file format of Windows, and widely used for
              uncompressed audio.

              Normally <b>.wav</b> files have all formatting information in their headers,  and  so  do  not  need  any
              format  options  specified for an input file.  If any are, they will override the file header, and
              you will be warned to this effect.  You had better know what you are doing! Output format  options
              will cause a format conversion, and the <b>.wav</b> will written appropriately.

              SoX  can read and write linear PCM, floating point, μ-law, A-law, MS ADPCM, and IMA (or DVI) ADPCM
              encoded samples.  WAV files can also contain audio encoded  in  many  other  ways  (not  currently
              supported with SoX) e.g. MP3; in some cases such a file can still be read by SoX by overriding the
              file type, e.g.
                 play -t mp3 mp3-encoded.wav
              Big endian versions of RIFF files, called RIFX, are also supported.  To write a RIFX file, use the
              <b>-B</b> option with the output file options.

       <b>waveaudio</b> (optional)
              MS-Windows native audio device driver.  Examples:
                   sox infile -t waveaudio
                   sox infile -t waveaudio default
                   sox infile -t waveaudio 1
                   sox infile -t waveaudio "High Definition Audio Device ("
              If  the  device  name is omitted, <b>-1</b>, or <b>default</b>, then you get the `Microsoft Wave Mapper' device.
              Wave Mapper means `use the system default audio devices'.  You can control  what  `default'  means
              via the OS Control Panel.

              If  the  device  name given is some other number, you get that audio device by index; so recording
              with device name <b>0</b> would get the first input device (perhaps the  microphone),  <b>1</b>  would  get  the
              second  (perhaps  line  in),  etc.  Playback using <b>0</b> will get the first output device (usually the
              only audio device).

              If the device name given is something other than a number, SoX  tries  to  match  it  (maximum  31
              characters) against the names of the available devices.

              See also <b><a href="../man1/play.1.html">play</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/rec.1.html">rec</a></b>(1), and <b><a href="../man1/sox.1.html">sox</a></b>(1) <b>-d</b>.

       <b>.wavpcm</b>
              A  non-standard,  but  widely used, variant of <b>.wav</b>.  Some applications cannot read a standard WAV
              file header for PCM-encoded data with sample-size greater than  16-bits  or  with  more  than  two
              channels,  but  can  read  a  non-standard  WAV  header.  It is likely that such applications will
              eventually be updated to support the standard header, but in the mean time, this SoX format can be
              used to create files with the non-standard header that should work with these applications.  (Note
              that SoX will automatically detect and read WAV files with the non-standard header.)

              The most common use of this file-type is likely to be along the following lines:
                   sox infile.any -t wavpcm -e signed-integer outfile.wav

       <b>.wv</b> (optional)
              WavPack lossless audio compression.  Note that, when converting  <b>.wav</b>  to  this  format  and  back
              again, the RIFF header is not necessarily preserved losslessly (though the audio is).

       <b>.wve</b> (also with <b>-t</b> <b>sndfile</b>)
              Psion  8-bit A-law.  Used on Psion SIBO PDAs (Series 3 and similar).  This format is deprecated in
              SoX, but will continue to be used in libsndfile.

       <b>.xa</b>    Maxis XA files.  These are 16-bit ADPCM audio files used by Maxis games.   Writing  .xa  files  is
              currently not supported, although adding write support should not be very difficult.

       <b>.xi</b> (optional)
              Fasttracker 2 Extended Instrument format.
