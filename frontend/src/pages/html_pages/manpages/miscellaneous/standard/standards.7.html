       standards - C and UNIX Standards

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  STANDARDS  section  that  appears  in  many  manual  pages identifies various standards to which the
       documented interface conforms.  The following list briefly describes these standards.

       <b>V7</b>     Version 7 (also known as Seventh Edition) UNIX, released by AT&amp;T/Bell Labs in  1979.   After  this
              point, UNIX systems diverged into two main dialects: BSD and System V.

       <b>4.2BSD</b> This  is  an  implementation  standard  defined  by  the  4.2  release  of  the  <u>Berkeley</u> <u>Software</u>
              <u>Distribution</u>, released by the University of California at Berkeley.  This was the  first  Berkeley
              release that contained a TCP/IP stack and the sockets API.  4.2BSD was released in 1983.

              Earlier major BSD releases included <u>3BSD</u> (1980), <u>4BSD</u> (1980), and <u>4.1BSD</u> (1981).

       <b>4.3BSD</b> The successor to 4.2BSD, released in 1986.

       <b>4.4BSD</b> The successor to 4.3BSD, released in 1993.  This was the last major Berkeley release.

       <b>System</b> <b>V</b>
              This  is  an  implementation  standard  defined by AT&amp;T's milestone 1983 release of its commercial
              System V (five) release.  The previous major AT&amp;T release was <u>System</u> <u>III</u>, released in 1981.

       <b>System</b> <b>V</b> <b>release</b> <b>2</b> <b>(SVr2)</b>
              This was the next System V release, made in 1985.  The SVr2 was formally described in the <u>System</u> <u>V</u>
              <u>Interface</u> <u>Definition</u> <u>version</u> <u>1</u> (<u>SVID</u> <u>1</u>) published in 1985.

       <b>System</b> <b>V</b> <b>release</b> <b>3</b> <b>(SVr3)</b>
              This was the successor to SVr2, released in 1986.  This release  was  formally  described  in  the
              <u>System</u> <u>V</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>Definition</u> <u>version</u> <u>2</u> (<u>SVID</u> <u>2</u>).

       <b>System</b> <b>V</b> <b>release</b> <b>4</b> <b>(SVr4)</b>
              This  was  the  successor to SVr3, released in 1989.  This version of System V is described in the
              "Programmer's Reference Manual: Operating System API (Intel processors)" (Prentice-Hall 1992, ISBN
              0-13-951294-2) This release was formally described in the <u>System</u> <u>V</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>Definition</u> <u>version</u>  <u>3</u>
              (<u>SVID</u> <u>3</u>), and is considered the definitive System V release.

       <b>SVID</b> <b>4</b> System  V  Interface Definition version 4, issued in 1995.  Available online at <a href="http://www.sco.com">http://www.sco.com</a>
              /developers/devspecs/.

       <b>C89</b>    This was the first C language standard, ratified by ANSI (American National  Standards  Institute)
              in 1989 (<u>X3.159-1989</u>).  Sometimes this is known as <u>ANSI</u> <u>C</u>, but since C99 is also an ANSI standard,
              this  term  is  ambiguous.   This  standard  was  also  ratified  by  ISO (International Standards
              Organization) in 1990 (<u>ISO/IEC</u> <u>9899:1990</u>), and is thus occasionally referred to as <u>ISO</u> <u>C90</u>.

       <b>C99</b>    This revision of the C language  standard  was  ratified  by  ISO  in  1999  (<u>ISO/IEC</u>  <u>9899:1999</u>).
              Available online at <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards</a>.

       <b>C11</b>    This revision of the C language standard was ratified by ISO in 2011 (<u>ISO/IEC</u> <u>9899:2011</u>).

       <b>LFS</b>    The  Large  File  Summit  specification, completed in 1996.  This specification defined mechanisms
              that allowed 32-bit systems to support the use of large files (i.e., 64-bit  file  offsets).   See
              https://www.opengroup.org/platform/lfs.html.

       <b>POSIX.1-1988</b>
              This  was  the  first  POSIX  standard, ratified by IEEE as IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, and subsequently
              adopted (with minor revisions) as an ISO standard in 1990.  The term "POSIX" was coined by Richard
              Stallman.

       <b>POSIX.1-1990</b>
              "Portable Operating System Interface  for  Computing  Environments".   IEEE  1003.1-1990  part  1,
              ratified by ISO in 1990 (<u>ISO/IEC</u> <u>9945-1:1990</u>).

       <b>POSIX.2</b>
              IEEE  Std  1003.2-1992,  describing  commands  and  utilities,  ratified  by  ISO in 1993 (<u>ISO/IEC</u>
              <u>9945-2:1993</u>).

       <b>POSIX.1b</b> (formerly known as <u>POSIX.4</u>)
              IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993, describing real-time facilities for portable operating systems, ratified by
              ISO in 1996 (<u>ISO/IEC</u> <u>9945-1:1996</u>).

       <b>POSIX.1c</b> (formerly known as <u>POSIX.4a</u>)
              IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995, which describes the POSIX threads interfaces.

       <b>POSIX.1d</b>
              IEEE Std 1003.1d-1999, which describes additional real-time extensions.

       <b>POSIX.1g</b>
              IEEE Std 1003.1g-2000, which describes networking APIs (including sockets).

       <b>POSIX.1j</b>
              IEEE Std 1003.1j-2000, which describes advanced real-time extensions.

       <b>POSIX.1-1996</b>
              A 1996 revision of POSIX.1 which incorporated POSIX.1b and POSIX.1c.

       <b>XPG3</b>   Released in 1989, this was the first release of the X/Open Portability Guide  to  be  based  on  a
              POSIX  standard  (POSIX.1-1988).   This  multivolume  guide  was  developed by the X/Open Group, a
              multivendor consortium.

       <b>XPG4</b>   A revision of the X/Open Portability Guide, released in 1992.  This revision incorporated POSIX.2.

       <b>XPG4v2</b> A 1994 revision of XPG4.  This is also referred to as <u>Spec</u> <u>1170</u>, where 1170 referred to the number
              of interfaces defined by this standard.

       <b>SUS</b> <b>(SUSv1)</b>
              Single UNIX Specification.  This was a repackaging of XPG4v2 and other  X/Open  standards  (X/Open
              Curses  Issue  4  version 2, X/Open Networking Service (XNS) Issue 4).  Systems conforming to this
              standard can be branded <u>UNIX</u> <u>95</u>.

       <b>SUSv2</b>  Single UNIX Specification version 2.  Sometimes also referred  to  (incorrectly)  as  <u>XPG5</u>.   This
              standard  appeared in 1997.  Systems conforming to this standard can be branded <u>UNIX</u> <u>98</u>.  See also
              <a href="http://www.unix.org/version2/">http://www.unix.org/version2/</a>.)

       <b>POSIX.1-2001</b>
       <b>SUSv3</b>  This was a 2001 revision and consolidation of the POSIX.1,  POSIX.2,  and  SUS  standards  into  a
              single  document,  conducted  under  the  auspices  of  the  Austin Group <a href="http://www.opengroup.org">http://www.opengroup.org</a>
              /austin/.  The standard is available online at <a href="http://www.unix.org/version3/">http://www.unix.org/version3/</a>.

              The standard defines two levels of conformance: <u>POSIX</u> <u>conformance</u>, which  is  a  baseline  set  of
              interfaces required of a conforming system; and <u>XSI</u> <u>Conformance</u>, which additionally mandates a set
              of interfaces (the "XSI extension") which are only optional for POSIX conformance.  XSI-conformant
              systems can be branded <u>UNIX</u> <u>03</u>.

              The POSIX.1-2001 document is broken into four parts:

              <b>XBD</b>: Definitions, terms, and concepts, header file specifications.

              <b>XSH</b>:   Specifications   of   functions  (i.e.,  system  calls  and  library  functions  in  actual
              implementations).

              <b>XCU</b>: Specifications of commands and utilities (i.e., the area formerly described by POSIX.2).

              <b>XRAT</b>: Informative text on the other parts of the standard.

              POSIX.1-2001 is aligned with C99, so that all of the library functions  standardized  in  C99  are
              also standardized in POSIX.1-2001.

              The  Single UNIX Specification version 3 (SUSv3) comprises the Base Specifications containing XBD,
              XSH, XCU, and XRAT as above, plus X/Open Curses Issue 4 version 2 as an extra volume that  is  not
              in POSIX.1-2001.

              Two  Technical  Corrigenda  (minor  fixes  and  improvements)  of  the original 2001 standard have
              occurred: TC1 in 2003 and TC2 in 2004.

       <b>POSIX.1-2008</b>
       <b>SUSv4</b>  Work on the next revision of POSIX.1/SUS was completed and ratified  in  2008.   The  standard  is
              available online at <a href="http://www.unix.org/version4/">http://www.unix.org/version4/</a>.

              The changes in this revision are not as large as those that occurred for POSIX.1-2001/SUSv3, but a
              number  of  new  interfaces are added and various details of existing specifications are modified.
              Many of the interfaces that were optional in POSIX.1-2001 become mandatory in the 2008 revision of
              the standard.  A few interfaces that are  present  in  POSIX.1-2001  are  marked  as  obsolete  in
              POSIX.1-2008, or removed from the standard altogether.

              The  revised  standard  is  structured  in  the  same  way  as  its  predecessor.  The Single UNIX
              Specification version 4 (SUSv4) comprises the Base Specifications containing XBD,  XSH,  XCU,  and
              XRAT, plus X/Open Curses Issue 7 as an extra volume that is not in POSIX.1-2008.

              Again  there  are  two levels of conformance: the baseline <u>POSIX</u> <u>Conformance</u>, and <u>XSI</u> <u>Conformance</u>,
              which mandates an additional set of interfaces beyond those in the base specification.

              In general, where the STANDARDS section of a manual page lists POSIX.1-2001,  it  can  be  assumed
              that the interface also conforms to POSIX.1-2008, unless otherwise noted.

              Technical Corrigendum 1 (minor fixes and improvements) of this standard was released in 2013.

              Technical Corrigendum 2 of this standard was released in 2016.

              Further information can be found on the Austin Group web site, <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/">http://www.opengroup.org/austin/</a>.

       <b>SUSv4</b> <b>2016</b> <b>edition</b>
              This  is  equivalent  to  POSIX.1-2008,  with the addition of Technical Corrigenda 1 and 2 and the
              XCurses specification.

       <b>POSIX.1-2017</b>
              This revision of POSIX is technically identical to POSIX.1-2008 with Technical Corrigenda 1 and  2
              applied.

       <b>SUSv4</b> <b>2018</b> <b>edition</b>
              This is equivalent to POSIX.1-2017, with the addition of the XCurses specification.

       The  interfaces documented in POSIX.1/SUS are available as manual pages under sections 0p (header files),
       1p (commands), and 3p (functions); thus one can write "man 3p open".
