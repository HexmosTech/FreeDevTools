</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       stddef.h — standard type definitions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;stddef.h&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <u>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</u> header shall define the following macros:

       NULL      Null pointer constant.  The macro shall expand to an integer constant expression with the value
                 0 cast to type <b>void</b> <b>*</b>.

       offsetof(<u>type</u>, <u>member-designator</u>)
                 Integer  constant  expression  of type <b>size_t</b>, the value of which is the offset in bytes to the
                 structure member (<u>member-designator</u>), from the beginning of its structure (<u>type</u>).

       The <u>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</u> header shall define the following types:

       <b>ptrdiff_t</b> Signed integer type of the result of subtracting two pointers.

       <b>wchar_t</b>   Integer type whose range of values can represent distinct codes for all members of the  largest
                 extended character set specified among the supported locales; the null character shall have the
                 code  value  zero.  Each member of the basic character set shall have a code value equal to its
                 value when used as the lone character in an integer character  constant  if  an  implementation
                 does not define __STDC_MB_MIGHT_NEQ_WC__.

       <b>size_t</b>    Unsigned integer type of the result of the <u>sizeof</u> operator.

       The  implementation  shall support one or more programming environments in which the widths of <b>ptrdiff_t</b>,
       <b>size_t</b>, and <b>wchar_t</b> are no greater than  the  width  of  type  <b>long</b>.   The  names  of  these  programming
       environments can be obtained using the <u>confstr</u>() function or the <u>getconf</u> utility.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  ISO C standard does not require the NULL macro to include the cast to type <b>void</b> <b>*</b> and specifies that
       the NULL macro be implementation-defined. POSIX.1‐2008 requires  the  cast  and  therefore  need  not  be
       implementation-defined.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
