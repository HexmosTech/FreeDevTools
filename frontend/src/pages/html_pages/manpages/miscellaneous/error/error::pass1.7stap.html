       error::pass1 - systemtap pass-1 errors

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Errors  that occur during pass 1 (parsing) usually mean a basic syntax error of some sort occurred in the
       systemtap script.  There are several classes of problems possible:

       plain syntax error
              The systemtap script parser detects a large variety of  errors,  such  as  missing  operands,  bad
              punctuation.   It  tries  to  list what kinds of tokens it was expecting to see, and will show the
              region of the source code with the problem.   Please  review  the  <u><a href="../man1/stap.1.html">stap</a></u>(1)  man  page  and/or  the
              tutorial, to correct the script's syntax.

       grammar ambiguities
              There  is at least one known ambiguity in the systemtap grammar.  It relates to the optionality of
              <u>;</u> (semicolon) separators between statements, and the <u>++</u> and <u>--</u> increment/decrement operators.   If
              the  parser  indicates  an  error,  consider  adding  some  explicit  <u>;</u>  separators between nearby
              statements and try again.

       missing command line arguments
              A systemtap script that uses the <u>$N</u> and <u>@N</u> constructs for substituting in command-line options may
              fail if not enough options were given on the stap command line.

       compatibility changes
              Some versions of systemtap have changed the language  incompatibly,  for  example  by  adding  the
              try/catch   keywords   for   exception   handling.   In  such  cases,  rerun  systemtap  with  the
              <u>--compatibility=VERSION</u> option, substituting the last systemtap  version  where  your  script  was
              known to work.  You may also check the release-history NEWS file for compatibility changes.

</pre><h4><b>GATHERING</b> <b>MORE</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       Increasing the verbosity of pass-1 with an option such as <u>--vp</u> <u>1</u> can help pinpoint the problem.
