</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The  GNU  implementation of the <u>man</u> macro package is part of the <u>groff</u> document formatting system.  It is
       used to produce manual pages (“man pages”) like the one you are reading.

       This document presents the macros thematically; for those needing only a quick reference,  the  following
       table lists them alphabetically, with cross references to appropriate subsections below.

       Man   page  authors  and  maintainers  who  are  not  already  experienced  <u>groff</u>  users  should  consult
       <u><a href="../man7/groff_man_style.7.html">groff_man_style</a></u>(7), an expanded version of this document, for additional  explanations  and  advice.   It
       covers  only  those  concepts required for man page document maintenance, and not the full breadth of the
       <u>groff</u> typesetting system.

       We discuss other macros (<b>.AT</b>, <b>.DT</b>, <b>.HP</b>, <b>.OP</b>, <b>.PD</b>, and <b>.UC</b>) in subsection “Deprecated features” below.

       Throughout Unix documentation, a manual entry is referred to simply as a “man page”,  regardless  of  its
       length, without gendered implication, and irrespective of the macro package selected for its composition.

   <b>Macro</b> <b>reference</b> <b>preliminaries</b>
       A tagged paragraph describes each macro.  We present coupled pairs together, as with <b>.EX</b> and <b>.EE</b>.

       An  empty  macro  argument  can  be  specified  with a pair of double-quotes (""), but the <u>man</u> package is
       designed such that this should seldom be necessary.  Most macro arguments will be formatted  as  text  in
       the output; exceptions are noted.

   <b>Document</b> <b>structure</b> <b>macros</b>
       Document  structure macros organize a man page's content.  All of them break the output line.  <b>.TH</b> (title
       heading) identifies the document as a man page and configures the  page  headers  and  footers.   Section
       headings  (<b>.SH</b>),  one  of  which  is  mandatory and many of which are conventionally expected, facilitate
       location of material by the reader and aid the man page writer to discuss all essential  aspects  of  the
       topic.   Subsection  headings  (<b>.SS</b>)  are  optional  and  permit  sections that grow long to develop in a
       controlled way.  Many technical  discussions  benefit  from  examples;  lengthy  ones,  especially  those
       reflecting  multiple  lines of input to or output from the system, are usefully bracketed by <b>.EX</b> and <b>.EE</b>.
       When none of the  foregoing  meets  a  structural  demand,  use  <b>.RS</b>/<b>.RE</b>  to  inset  a  region  within  a
       (sub)section.

       <b>.TH</b> <u>topic</u> <u>section</u> [<u>footer-middle</u>] [<u>footer-inside</u>] [<u>header-middle</u>]
              Determine  the  contents  of the page header and footer.  The subject of the man page is <u>topic</u> and
              the section of the manual to which it belongs is <u>section.</u>  See <u><a href="../man1/man.1.html">man</a></u>(1) or <u><a href="../man1/intro.1.html">intro</a></u>(1) for  the  manual
              sectioning  applicable  to your system.  <u>topic</u> and <u>section</u> are positioned together at the left and
              right in the header (with <u>section</u> in parentheses immediately appended to <u>topic</u>).  <u>footer-middle</u> is
              centered in the footer.  The arrangement of the rest of the footer depends on whether double-sided
              layout is enabled with the option <b>-rD1</b>.  When disabled (the default), <u>footer-inside</u> is  positioned
              at  the  bottom left.  Otherwise, <u>footer-inside</u> appears at the bottom left on recto (odd-numbered)
              pages, and at the bottom right on verso (even-numbered) pages.  The outside  footer  is  the  page
              number,  except in the continuous-rendering mode enabled by the option <b>-rcR=1</b>, in which case it is
              the <u>topic</u> and <u>section,</u> as in the header.  <u>header-middle</u> is centered in the header.  If <u>section</u>  is
              an  integer  between  1 and 9 (inclusive), there is no need to specify <u>header-middle;</u> <u>an.tmac</u> will
              supply text for it.  The macro package may also abbreviate <u>topic</u> and <u>footer-inside</u>  with  ellipses
              if  they  would  overrun  the  space  available  in the header and footer, respectively.  For HTML
              output, headers and footers are suppressed.

              Additionally, this macro breaks the page, resetting the number to 1 (unless  the  <b>-rC1</b>  option  is
              given).  This feature is intended only for formatting multiple <u>man</u> documents in sequence.

              A valid <u>man</u> document calls <b>.TH</b> once, early in the file, prior to any other macro calls.

       <b>.SH</b> [<u>heading-text</u>]
              Set <u>heading-text</u> as a section heading.  If no argument is given, a one-line input trap is planted;
              text  on  the next line becomes <u>heading-text.</u>  The left margin is reset to zero to set the heading
              text in bold (or the font specified by the string  <b>HF</b>),  and,  on  typesetting  devices,  slightly
              larger  than  the  base  type size.  If the heading font <b>\*[HF]</b> is bold, use of an italic style in
              <u>heading-text</u> is mapped to the bold-italic style if available in the font family.  The inset  level
              is  reset  to 1, setting the left margin to the value of the <b>IN</b> register.  Text after <u>heading-text</u>
              is set as an ordinary paragraph (<b>.P</b>).

              The content of <u>heading-text</u> and ordering of sections follows a set of  common  practices,  as  has
              much  of  the  layout of material within sections.  For example, a section called “Name” or “NAME”
              must exist, must be the first section after the <b>.TH</b> call, and must contain only text of the form
                     <u>topic</u>[<b>,</b> <u>another-topic</u>]... \- <u>summary-description</u>
              for a man page to be properly indexed.  See <u><a href="../man7/groff_man_style.7.html">groff_man_style</a></u>(7) for suggestions and <u><a href="../man7/man.7.html">man</a></u>(7) for  the
              conventions prevailing on your system.

       <b>.SS</b> [<u>subheading-text</u>]
              Set  <u>subheading-text</u>  as  a  subsection heading indented between a section heading and an ordinary
              paragraph (<b>.P</b>).  If no argument is given, a one-line input trap is planted; text on the next  line
              becomes  <u>subheading-text.</u>   The  left  margin  is reset to the value of the <b>SN</b> register to set the
              heading text in bold (or the font specified by the string <b>HF</b>).  If  the  heading  font  <b>\*[HF]</b>  is
              bold, use of an italic style in <u>subheading-text</u> is mapped to the bold-italic style if available in
              the  font  family.   The inset level is reset to 1, setting the left margin to the value of the <b>IN</b>
              register.  Text after <u>subheading-text</u> is set as an ordinary paragraph (<b>.P</b>).

       <b>.EX</b>
       <b>.EE</b>    Begin and end example.  After <b>.EX</b>, filling is disabled and a constant-width (monospaced)  font  is
              selected.  Calling <b>.EE</b> enables filling and restores the previous font.

              These  macros  are  extensions  introduced  in  Ninth Edition Research Unix.  Systems running that
              <u>troff</u>, or those from Documenter's Workbench, Heirloom Doctools, or Plan 9 <u>troff</u> support them.   To
              be  certain  your  page  will  be portable to systems that do not, copy their definitions from the
              <u>an-ext.tmac</u> file of a <u>groff</u> installation.

       <b>.RS</b> [<u>inset-amount</u>]
              Start a new relative inset level.  The position of the left margin is saved, then moved  right  by
              <u>inset-amount,</u>  if  specified, and by the amount of the <b>IN</b> register otherwise.  Calls to <b>.RS</b> can be
              nested; each increments by 1 the inset level used by <b>.RE</b>.  The level prior to any <b>.RS</b> calls is 1.

       <b>.RE</b> [<u>level</u>]
              End a relative inset.  The left margin corresponding to inset level  <u>level</u>  is  restored.   If  no
              argument is given, the inset level is reduced by 1.

   <b>Paragraphing</b> <b>macros</b>
       An  ordinary  paragraph  (<b>.P</b>) is set without a first-line indentation at the current left margin.  In man
       pages and other technical literature, definition lists are frequently encountered; these can  be  set  as
       “tagged  paragraphs”, which have one (<b>.TP</b>) or more (<b>.TQ</b>) leading tags followed by a paragraph that has an
       additional indentation.  The indented paragraph (<b>.IP</b>) macro is useful to continue the indented content of
       a narrative started with <b>.TP</b>, or to present an itemized or ordered list.  All of these macros  break  the
       output  line.   If  another  paragraph macro has occurred since the previous <b>.SH</b> or <b>.SS</b>, they (except for
       <b>.TQ</b>) follow the break with a default amount of vertical space, which can be changed by the deprecated <b>.PD</b>
       macro; see subsection “Horizontal and vertical spacing” below.  They also reset the type  size  and  font
       style to defaults (<b>.TQ</b> again excepted); see subsection “Font style macros” below.

       <b>.P</b>
       <b>.LP</b>
       <b>.PP</b>    Begin  a  new  paragraph;  these  macros  are synonymous.  The indentation is reset to the default
              value; the left margin, as affected by <b>.RS</b> and <b>.RE</b>, is not.

       <b>.TP</b> [<u>indentation</u>]
              Set a paragraph with a leading tag, and the remainder of the paragraph indented.  A one-line input
              trap is planted; text on the next line, which can be formatted with  a  macro,  becomes  the  tag,
              which  is placed at the current left margin.  The tag can be extended with the <b>\c</b> escape sequence.
              Subsequent text is indented by <u>indentation,</u> if specified, and by the amount  of  the  <b>IN</b>  register
              otherwise.  If the tag is not as wide as the indentation, the paragraph starts on the same line as
              the  tag,  at  the  applicable  indentation, and continues on the following lines.  Otherwise, the
              descriptive part of the paragraph begins on the line following the tag.

       <b>.TQ</b>    Set an additional tag for a paragraph tagged with <b>.TP</b>.  An input trap is planted as with <b>.TP</b>.

              This macro is a GNU extension not defined on systems running AT&amp;T, Plan 9, or Solaris  <u>troff</u>;  see
              <u>an-ext.tmac</u> in section “Files” below.

       <b>.IP</b> [<u>tag</u>] [<u>indentation</u>]
              Set  an  indented  paragraph with an optional tag.  The <u>tag</u> and <u>indentation</u> arguments, if present,
              are handled as with <b>.TP</b>, with the exception that the <u>tag</u> argument to <b>.IP</b> cannot  include  a  macro
              call.

   <b>Command</b> <b>synopsis</b> <b>macros</b>
       <b>.SY</b>  and  <b>.YS</b> aid you to construct a command synopsis that has the classical Unix appearance.  They break
       the output line.

       These macros are GNU extensions not defined on systems running  AT&amp;T,  Plan  9,  or  Solaris  <u>troff</u>;  see
       <u>an-ext.tmac</u> in section “Files” below.

       <b>.SY</b> <u>command</u>
              Begin  synopsis.   A  new  paragraph  begins at the left margin unless <b>.SY</b> has already been called
              without a corresponding <b>.YS</b>, in which case only a break is performed.   Adjustment  and  automatic
              hyphenation  are disabled.  <u>command</u> is set in bold.  If a break is required, lines after the first
              are indented by the width of <u>command</u> plus a space.

       <b>.YS</b>    End synopsis.  Indentation, adjustment, and hyphenation are restored to their previous states.

   <b>Hyperlink</b> <b>macros</b>
       Man page cross references are best presented with <b>.MR</b>.  Text may be hyperlinked to email  addresses  with
       <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME</b>  or  other URIs with <b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE</b>.  Hyperlinked text is supported on HTML and terminal output devices;
       terminals and pager programs must support ECMA-48 OSC 8 escape sequences (see  <u><a href="../man1/grotty.1.html">grotty</a></u>(1)).   When  device
       support  is  unavailable  or disabled with the <b>U</b> register (see section “Options” below), <b>.MT</b> and <b>.UR</b> URIs
       are rendered between angle brackets after the linked text.

       <b>.MT</b>, <b>.ME</b>, <b>.UR</b>, and <b>.UE</b> are GNU extensions not defined on systems running AT&amp;T, Plan 9, or Solaris  <u>troff</u>;
       see <u>an-ext.tmac</u> in section “Files” below.  Plan 9 from User Space's <u>troff</u> implements <b>.MR</b>.

       The  arguments  to  <b>.MR</b>,  <b>.MT</b>,  and  <b>.UR</b>  should be prepared for typesetting since they can appear in the
       output.  Use special character escape sequences to encode Unicode basic Latin characters where necessary,
       particularly the hyphen-minus.  The formatter removes <b>\:</b> escape sequences from hyperlinks when  supplying
       device control commands to output drivers.

       <b>.MR</b> <u>topic</u> <u>manual-section</u> [<u>trailing-text</u>]
              <u>(since</u>  groff  <u>1.23)</u>  Set a man page cross reference as “<u>topic</u><b>(</b><u>manual-section</u><b>)</b>”.  If <u>trailing-text</u>
              (typically punctuation) is specified, it  follows  the  closing  parenthesis  without  intervening
              space.   Hyphenation  is  disabled  while  the  cross  reference is set.  <u>topic</u> is set in the font
              specified  by  the  <b>MF</b>  string.   The  cross  reference  hyperlinks  to  a   URI   of   the   form
              “<b>man:</b><u>topic</u>(<u>manual-section</u>)”.

       <b>.MT</b> <u>address</u>
       <b>.ME</b> [<u>trailing-text</u>]
              Identify  <u>address</u> as an RFC 6068 <u>addr-spec</u> for a “mailto:” URI with the text between the two macro
              calls as the link text.  An argument to <b>.ME</b> is placed after  the  link  text  without  intervening
              space.   <u>address</u>  may  not  be  visible  in  the  rendered  document if hyperlinks are enabled and
              supported by the output driver.  If they are not, <u>address</u> is set in angle brackets after the  link
              text  and  before <u>trailing-text.</u>  If hyperlinking is enabled but there is no link text, <u>address</u> is
              formatted and hyperlinked <u>without</u> angle brackets.

       <b>.UR</b> <u>uri</u>
       <b>.UE</b> [<u>trailing-text</u>]
              Identify <u>uri</u> as an RFC 3986 URI hyperlink with the text between the two macro calls  as  the  link
              text.  An argument to <b>.UE</b> is placed after the link text without intervening space.  <u>uri</u> may not be
              visible in the rendered document if hyperlinks are enabled and supported by the output driver.  If
              they  are  not,  <u>uri</u>  is  set  in angle brackets after the link text and before <u>trailing-text.</u>  If
              hyperlinking is enabled but there is no link text, <u>uri</u> is formatted and hyperlinked <u>without</u>  angle
              brackets.

       The  hyperlinking  of <b>.TP</b> paragraph tags with <b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE</b> and <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME</b> is not yet supported; if attempted, the
       hyperlink will be typeset at the  beginning  of  the  indented  paragraph  even  on  hyperlink-supporting
       devices.

   <b>Font</b> <b>style</b> <b>macros</b>
       The  <u>man</u>  macro package is limited in its font styling options, offering only <b>bold</b> (<b>.B</b>), <u>italic</u> (<b>.I</b>), and
       roman.  Italic text is usually set underscored instead on terminal devices.  The <b>.SM</b> and <b>.SB</b>  macros  set
       text  in  roman  or  bold, respectively, at a smaller type size; these differ visually from regular-sized
       roman or bold text only on typesetting devices.  It is often necessary to set text  in  different  styles
       without intervening space.  The macros <b>.BI</b>, <b>.BR</b>, <b>.IB</b>, <b>.IR</b>, <b>.RB</b>, and <b>.RI</b>, where “B”, “I”, and “R” indicate
       bold,  italic, and roman, respectively, set their odd- and even-numbered arguments in alternating styles,
       with no space separating them.

       The default type size and family for typesetting devices is 10-point Times,  except  on  the  <b>X75-12</b>  and
       <b>X100-12</b> devices where the type size is 12 points.  The default style is roman.

       <b>.B</b> [<u>text</u>]
              Set  <u>text</u>  in  bold.   If no argument is given, a one-line input trap is planted; text on the next
              line, which can be further formatted with a macro, is set in bold.

       <b>.I</b> [<u>text</u>]
              Set <u>text</u> in an italic or oblique face.  If no argument is given, a one-line input trap is planted;
              text on the next line, which can be further formatted with a macro, is set in an italic or oblique
              face.

       <b>.SM</b> [<u>text</u>]
              Set <u>text</u> one point smaller than the default type size on typesetting devices.  If no  argument  is
              given,  a  one-line  input  trap is planted; text on the next line, which can be further formatted
              with a macro, is set smaller.

       <b>.SB</b> [<u>text</u>]
              Set <u>text</u> in bold and (on typesetting devices) one point smaller than the default type size.  If no
              argument is given, a one-line input trap is planted; text on the next line, which can  be  further
              formatted  with  a  macro,  is  set smaller and in bold.  This macro is an extension introduced in
              SunOS 4.0.

       Unlike the above font style macros, the font style alternation macros below set no input traps; they must
       be given arguments to have effect.  Italic corrections are applied as appropriate.

       <b>.BI</b> <u>bold-text</u> <u>italic-text</u> ...
              Set each argument in bold and italics, alternately.

       <b>.BR</b> <u>bold-text</u> <u>roman-text</u> ...
              Set each argument in bold and roman, alternately.

       <b>.IB</b> <u>italic-text</u> <u>bold-text</u> ...
              Set each argument in italics and bold, alternately.

       <b>.IR</b> <u>italic-text</u> <u>roman-text</u> ...
              Set each argument in italics and roman, alternately.

       <b>.RB</b> <u>roman-text</u> <u>bold-text</u> ...
              Set each argument in roman and bold, alternately.

       <b>.RI</b> <u>roman-text</u> <u>italic-text</u> ...
              Set each argument in roman and italics, alternately.

   <b>Horizontal</b> <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>spacing</b>
       The <u>indentation</u> argument accepted by <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, and the deprecated  <b>.HP</b>  is  a  number  plus  an  optional
       scaling  unit,  as  is <b>.RS</b>'s <u>inset-amount</u>.  If no scaling unit is given, the <u>man</u> package assumes “n”.  An
       indentation specified in a call to <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, or the deprecated <b>.HP</b> persists until (1)  another  of  these
       macros  is  called  with an <u>indentation</u> argument, or (2) <b>.SH</b>, <b>.SS</b>, or <b>.P</b> or its synonyms is called; these
       clear the indentation entirely.

       The left margin used by ordinary paragraphs set with <b>.P</b> (and its synonyms) not within an <b>.RS</b>/<b>.RE</b> relative
       inset is 7.2n for typesetting devices and 7n for terminal devices (but see the  <b>-rIN</b>  option).   Headers,
       footers  (both  set  with  <b>.TH</b>), and section headings (<b>.SH</b>) are set at the page offset (see <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7)) and
       subsection headings (<b>.SS</b>) indented from it by 3n (but see the <b>-rSN</b> option).

       Several macros insert vertical space: <b>.SH</b>, <b>.SS</b>, <b>.TP</b>, <b>.P</b> (and its synonyms), <b>.IP</b>, and the deprecated  <b>.HP</b>.
       The  default  inter-section  and  inter-paragraph  spacing  is  is  1v  for terminal devices and 0.4v for
       typesetting devices.  (The deprecated macro <b>.PD</b>  can  change  this  vertical  spacing,  but  its  use  is
       discouraged.)  Between <b>.EX</b> and <b>.EE</b> calls, the inter-paragraph spacing is 1v regardless of output device.

   <b>Registers</b>
       Registers  are described in section “Options” below.  They can be set not only on the command line but in
       the site <u>man.local</u> file as well; see section “Files” below.

   <b>Strings</b>
       The following strings are defined for use in man pages.  None of these is necessary in a contemporary man
       page; see <u><a href="../man7/groff_man_style.7.html">groff_man_style</a></u>(7).  Others are  supported  for  configuration  of  rendering  parameters;  see
       section “Options” below.

       <b>\*R</b>    interpolates  a  special  character  escape  sequence  for  the  “registered sign” glyph, <b>\(rg</b>, if
              available, and “(Reg.)” otherwise.

       <b>\*S</b>    interpolates an escape sequence setting the type size to the document default.

       <b>\*(lq</b>
       <b>\*(rq</b>  interpolate special character escape sequences for left and right double-quotation marks, <b>\(lq</b> and
              <b>\(rq</b>, respectively.

       <b>\*(Tm</b>  interpolates a special character escape sequence  for  the  “trade  mark  sign”  glyph,  <b>\(tm</b>,  if
              available, and “(TM)” otherwise.

   <b>Hooks</b>
       Two  macros,  both  GNU extensions, are called internally by the <u>groff</u> <u>man</u> package to format page headers
       and footers and can be redefined by the administrator in a site's <u>man.local</u>  file  (see  section  “Files”
       below).   The  presentation of <b>.TH</b> above describes the default headers and footers.  Because these macros
       are hooks for <u>groff</u> <u>man</u> internals, man pages have no reason to call them.   Such  hook  definitions  will
       likely  consist of “.sp” and “.tl” requests.  They must also increase the page length with “.pl” requests
       in continuous rendering mode; <b>.PT</b> furthermore has the responsibility of emitting  a  PDF  bookmark  after
       writing  the  first  page  header  in  a  document.  Consult the existing implementations in <u>an.tmac</u> when
       drafting replacements.

       <b>.BT</b>    Set the page footer text (“bottom trap”).

       <b>.PT</b>    Set the page header text (“page trap”).

       To remove a page header or footer entirely, define the appropriate macro as empty  rather  than  deleting
       it.

   <b>Deprecated</b> <b>features</b>
       Use of the following in man pages for public distribution is discouraged.

       <b>.AT</b> [<u>system</u> [<u>release</u>]]
              Alter  the  footer  for  use  with legacy AT&amp;T man pages, overriding any definition of the <u>footer-</u>
              <u>inside</u> argument to <b>.TH</b>.  This macro exists only to render man pages from historical systems.

              <u>system</u> can be any of the following.

                     3      7th edition <u>(default)</u>

                     4      System III

                     5      System V

              The optional <u>release</u> argument specifies the release number, as in “System V Release 3”.

       <b>.DT</b>    Reset tab stops to the default (every 0.5i).

              Use of this presentation-oriented macro is deprecated.  It translates poorly to HTML, under  which
              exact  space  control and tabulation are not readily available.  Thus, information or distinctions
              that you use tab stops to express are likely to be lost.  If you feel tempted to  change  the  tab
              stops  such  that  calling  this  macro later is desirable to restore them, you should probably be
              composing a table using <u><a href="../man1/tbl.1.html">tbl</a></u>(1) instead.

       <b>.HP</b> [<u>indentation</u>]
              Set up a paragraph with a hanging left indentation.  The  <u>indentation</u>  argument,  if  present,  is
              handled as with <b>.TP</b>.

              Use  of this presentation-oriented macro is deprecated.  A hanging indentation cannot be expressed
              naturally under HTML, and non-<u>roff</u>-based man page  interpreters  may  treat  <b>.HP</b>  as  an  ordinary
              paragraph.  Thus, information or distinctions you mean to express with indentation may be lost.

       <b>.OP</b> <u>option-name</u> [<u>option-argument</u>]
              Indicate  an  optional  command parameter called <u>option-name</u>, which is set in bold.  If the option
              takes an argument, specify <u>option-argument</u> using a noun, abbreviation, or hyphenated noun  phrase.
              If  present,  <u>option-argument</u> is preceded by a space and set in italics.  Square brackets in roman
              surround both arguments.

              Use of this quasi-semantic macro, an extension originating in  Documenter's  Workbench  <u>troff</u>,  is
              deprecated.   It cannot easily be used to annotate options that take optional arguments or options
              whose arguments have internal structure (such as a mixture of literal  and  variable  components).
              One could work around these limitations with font selection escape sequences, but it is preferable
              to use font style alternation macros, which afford greater flexibility.

       <b>.PD</b> [<u>vertical-space</u>]
              Define  the  vertical  space between paragraphs or (sub)sections.  The optional argument <u>vertical-</u>
              <u>space</u> specifies the amount; the default scaling unit is “v”.  Without an argument, the spacing  is
              reset to its default value; see subsection “Horizontal and vertical spacing” above.

              Use  of this presentation-oriented macro is deprecated.  It translates poorly to HTML, under which
              exact control  of  inter-paragraph  spacing  is  not  readily  available.   Thus,  information  or
              distinctions that you use <b>.PD</b> to express are likely to be lost.

       <b>.UC</b> [<u>version</u>]
              Alter the footer for use with legacy BSD man pages, overriding any definition of the <u>footer-inside</u>
              argument to <b>.TH</b>.  This macro exists only to render man pages from historical systems.

              <u>version</u> can be any of the following.

                     3      3rd Berkeley Distribution <u>(default)</u>

                     4      4th Berkeley Distribution

                     5      4.2 Berkeley Distribution

                     6      4.3 Berkeley Distribution

                     7      4.4 Berkeley Distribution

   <b>History</b>
       M. Douglas McIlroy  designed,  implemented,  and documented the AT&amp;T <u>man</u> macros for Unix Version 7 (1979)
       and employed them to edit the first volume of its <u>Programmer's</u> <u>Manual</u>, a compilation  of  all  man  pages
       supplied  by  the system.  That <u>man</u> supported the macros listed in this page not described as extensions,
       except <b>.P</b> and the deprecated <b>.AT</b> and <b>.UC</b>.  The only strings defined were  <b>R</b>  and  <b>S</b>;  no  registers  were
       documented.

       <b>.UC</b>  appeared  in 3BSD (1980).  Unix System III (1980) introduced <b>.P</b> and exposed the registers <b>IN</b> and <b>LL</b>,
       which had been internal to Seventh Edition Unix <u>man</u>.  PWB/UNIX 2.0 (1980)  added  the  <b>Tm</b>  string.   4BSD
       (1980)  added  <b>lq</b>  and  <b>rq</b> strings.  SunOS 2.0 (1985) recognized <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>P</b>, and <b>X</b> registers.  4.3BSD (1986)
       added <b>.AT</b> and <b>.P</b>.  Ninth Edition Research Unix (1986) introduced <b>.EX</b> and <b>.EE</b>.   SunOS  4.0  (1988)  added
       <b>.SB</b>.

       The  foregoing  features were what James Clark implemented in early versions of <u>groff</u>.  Later, <u>groff</u> 1.20
       (2009) originated <b>.SY</b>/<b>.YS</b>, <b>.TQ</b>, <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME</b>, and <b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE</b>.  Plan 9 from User Space's <u>troff</u> introduced  <b>.MR</b>  in
       2020.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       The  following <u>groff</u> options set registers (with <b>-r</b>) and strings (with <b>-d</b>) recognized and used by the <u>man</u>
       macro package.  To ensure rendering consistent with output device capabilities  and  reader  preferences,
       man pages should never manipulate them.

       <b>-dAD=</b><u>adjustment-mode</u>
              Set line adjustment to <u>adjustment-mode,</u> which is typically “<b>b</b>” for adjustment to both margins (the
              default),  or  “<b>l</b>”  for left alignment (ragged right margin).  Any valid argument to <u>groff</u>'s “.ad”
              request may be used.  See <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7) for less-common choices.

       <b>-rcR=1</b> Enable continuous rendering.  Output is not paginated; instead, one (potentially very  long)  page
              is  produced.   This  is  the  default for terminal and HTML devices.  Use <b>-rcR=0</b> to disable it on
              terminal devices; on HTML devices, it cannot be disabled.

       <b>-rC1</b>   Number output pages consecutively, in strictly increasing sequence, rather than resetting the page
              number to 1 (or the value of register <b>P</b>) with each new <u>man</u> document.

       <b>-rCS=1</b> Set section headings (the argument(s) to <b>.SH</b>) in full capitals.  This  transformation  is  off  by
              default because it discards case distinction information.

       <b>-rCT=1</b> Set  the man page topic (the first argument to <b>.TH</b>) in full capitals in headers and footers.  This
              transformation is off by default because it discards case distinction information.

       <b>-rD1</b>   Enable double-sided layout, formatting footers  for  even  and  odd  pages  differently;  see  the
              description of <b>.TH</b> in subsection “Document structure macros” above.

       <b>-rFT=</b><u>footer-distance</u>
              Set  distance  of the footer relative to the bottom of the page to <u>footer-distance;</u> this amount is
              always negative.  At one half-inch above this location, the page text is broken before writing the
              footer.  Ignored if continuous rendering is enabled.  The default is -0.5i.

       <b>-dHF=</b><u>heading-font</u>
              Set the font used for section and subsection headings; the default  is  “<b>B</b>”  (bold  style  of  the
              default family).  Any valid argument to <u>groff</u>'s “.ft” request may be used.  See <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7).

       <b>-rHY=0</b> Disable  automatic  hyphenation.  Normally, it is enabled (1).  The hyphenation mode is determined
              by the <u>groff</u> locale; see section “Localization“ of <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7).

       <b>-rIN=</b><u>standard-indentation</u>
              Set the amount of indentation used for ordinary paragraphs (<b>.P</b> and its synonyms) and  the  default
              indentation  amount used by <b>.IP</b>, <b>.RS</b>, <b>.TP</b>, and the deprecated <b>.HP</b>.  See subsection “Horizontal and
              vertical spacing” above for the default.  For terminal devices, <u>standard-indentation</u> should always
              be an integer multiple of unit “n” to get consistent indentation.

       <b>-rLL=</b><u>line-length</u>
              Set line length; the default is 78n for terminal devices and 6.5i for typesetting devices.

       <b>-rLT=</b><u>title-length</u>
              Set the line length for titles.  By default, it is set to the line length (see <b>-rLL</b> above).

       <b>-dMF=</b><u>man-page-topic-font</u>
              Set the font used for man page topics named in <b>.TH</b> and <b>.MR</b> calls; the default is “<b>I</b>” (italic style
              of the default family).  Any valid argument to <u>groff</u>'s “.ft” request  may  be  used.   If  the  <b>MF</b>
              string  ends  in  “I”, it is assumed to be an oblique typeface, and italic corrections are applied
              before and after man page topics.

       <b>-rP</b><u>n</u>   Start enumeration of pages at <u>n</u>.  The default is 1.

       <b>-rS</b><u>type-size</u>
              Use <u>type-size</u> for the document's body text; acceptable values are  10,  11,  or  12  points.   See
              subsection “Font style macros” above for the default.

       <b>-rSN=</b><u>subsection-indentation</u>
              Set  indentation of subsection headings to <u>subsection-indentation.</u>  See subsection “Horizontal and
              vertical spacing” above for the default.

       <b>-rU1</b>   Enable generation of URI hyperlinks in the <u>grohtml</u> and <u>grotty</u>  output  drivers.   <u>grohtml</u>  enables
              them  by  default;  <u>grotty</u>  does  not,  pending  more  widespread  pager  support for OSC 8 escape
              sequences.  Use <b>-rU0</b> to disable hyperlinks; this will make  the  arguments  to  <b>MT</b>  and  <b>UR</b>  calls
              visible in the document text produced by link-capable drivers.

       <b>-rX</b><u>p</u>   Number  successors of page <u>p</u> as <u>p</u>a, <u>p</u>b, <u>p</u>c, and so forth.  The register tracking the suffixed page
              letter uses format “a” (see the “.af” request in <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7)).

</pre><h4><b>Files</b></h4><pre>

              Most <u>man</u> macros are defined in this file.  It also loads extensions from <u>an-ext.tmac</u> (see below).

       <u><a href="file:/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/andoc.tmac">/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/andoc.tmac</a></u>
              This brief <u>groff</u> program detects whether the <u>man</u> or <u>mdoc</u> macro package is being used by a document
              and loads the correct macro definitions, taking advantage of the fact that pages using  them  must
              call  <b>.TH</b>  or  <b>.Dd</b>,  respectively,  before  any  other  macros.  A <u>man</u> program or user typing, for
              example, “<b>groff</b> <b>-mandoc</b> <b>page.1</b>”, need not know which package the file <u>page.1</u> uses.   Multiple  man
              pages, in either format, can be handled; <u>andoc</u> reloads each macro package as necessary.

       <u><a href="file:/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/an-ext.tmac">/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/an-ext.tmac</a></u>
              Except for <b>.SB</b>, definitions of macros described above as extensions are contained in this file; in
              some  cases, they are simpler versions of definitions appearing in <u>an.tmac</u>, and are ignored if the
              formatter is GNU <u>troff</u>.  They are written to  be  compatible  with  AT&amp;T  <u>troff</u>  and  permissively
              licensed—not  copylefted.   To reduce the risk of name space collisions, string and register names
              begin only with “<b>m</b>”<b>.</b>  We encourage man page authors who are concerned about portability to  legacy
              Unix  systems to copy these definitions into their pages, and maintainers of <u>troff</u> implementations
              or work-alike systems that format man pages to re-use them.

              The definitions for these macros are read after a page calls <b>.TH</b>, so they will replace any  macros
              of the same names preceding it in your file.  If you use your own implementations of these macros,
              they  must  be  defined after <b>.TH</b> is called to have any effect.  Furthermore, it is wise to define
              such page-local macros (if at all) after the “Name” section to  accommodate  timid  <u>makewhatis</u>  or
              <u>mandb</u> implementations that may give up their scan for indexing material early.

</pre><h4><b>Authors</b></h4><pre>
       The  initial  GNU  implementation  of  the  <u>man</u>  macro package was written by James Clark.  Later, Werner
       Lemberg supplied the <b>S</b>, <b>LT</b>, and <b>cR</b> registers, the last a 4.3BSD-Reno <u><a href="../man7/mdoc.7.html">mdoc</a></u>(7) feature.  Larry Kollar added
       the <b>FT</b>, <b>HY</b>, and <b>SN</b> registers; the <b>HF</b> string; and the <b>PT</b> and <b>BT</b> macros.   G. Branden Robinson  implemented
       the  <b>AD</b>  and <b>MF</b> strings; <b>CS</b>, <b>CT</b>, and <b>U</b> registers; and the <b>MR</b> macro.  Except for <b>.SB</b>, the extension macros
       were written by Lemberg, Eric S. Raymond, and Robinson.

       This document was originally written for the Debian  GNU/Linux  system  by  Susan G. Kleinmann.   It  was
       corrected  and  updated  by  Lemberg  and  Robinson.  The extension macros were documented by Raymond and
       Robinson.
