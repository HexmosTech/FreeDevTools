</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XConsortium - X Consortium information

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Releases 6.0 through 6.3 of X Version 11 were brought to you by the X Consortium, Inc.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  X  Consortium  was an independent, not-for-profit Delaware membership corporation.  It was formed in
       1993 as the successor to the MIT X Consortium.  The purpose  of  the  X  Consortium  was  to  foster  the
       development,  evolution,  and  maintenance of the X Window System, a comprehensive set of vendor-neutral,
       system-architecture neutral, network-transparent windowing and user interface standards.

       The X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  In  1988,
       MIT formed a member-funded consortium to provide the technical and administrative leadership necessary to
       support  further  development  of the X Window System.  In 1992, MIT and the membership decided it was in
       their best interests  to  move  the  consortium  out  of  MIT  and  create  an  independent,  stand-alone
       organization.  All rights to the X Window System were assigned by MIT to X Consortium, Inc. on January 1,
       1994.   X Consortium, Inc. closed its doors on December 31, 1996.  All rights to the X Window System have
       been assigned to the Open Software Foundation.

       The X Consortium was financially self-supporting through membership fees.   There  are  no  license  fees
       associated  with the use of X Window System standards and code developed by the X Consortium.  Membership
       in the X Consortium was open to any organization willing to execute a membership agreement.

       The X Consortium was a highly participative body.  Members were encouraged to actively cooperate with the
       staff and other members in the design and review of proposed specifications, and in  the  design,  coding
       and testing of sample implementations of those specifications.

       The  X  Consortium accomplished most of its work using electronic mail over the Internet, with individual
       mailing lists for working groups.  Internet electronic mail connectivity was viewed as a requirement  for
       useful  participation  in X Consortium activities.  Meetings were held as necessary, often in conjunction
       with industry conferences and trade shows.
