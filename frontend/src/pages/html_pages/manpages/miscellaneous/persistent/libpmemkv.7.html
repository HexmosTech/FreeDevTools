</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pmemkv</b> - Key/Value Datastore for Persistent Memory

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pmemkv</b>  is a key-value datastore framework optimized for persistent memory.  It provides native C API and
       C++ headers.  Support for other languages is described in the <b>BINDINGS</b> section below.

       It has multiple storage engines, each optimized for a different use case.  They differ in  implementation
       and capabilities:

       • persistence  - this is a trade-off between data preservation and performance; persistent engines retain
         their content and are power fail/crash safe, but are slower; volatile  engines  are  faster,  but  keep
         their content only until the database is closed (or application crashes; power fail occurs)

       • concurrency  - engines provide a varying degree of write scalability in multi-threaded workloads.  Con‐
         current engines support non-blocking retrievals and, on average, highly scalable updates.  For  details
         see the description of individual engines.

       • keys’ ordering - “sorted” engines support querying above/below the given key.  Most sorted engines also
         support  passing  a custom comparator object (see <b><a href="../man3/libpmemkv_config.3.html">libpmemkv_config</a></b>(3)).  By default, pmemkv stores ele‐
         ments in binary order (comparison is done using a function equivalent to std::string::compare).

       Persistent engines usually use libpmemobj++ and PMDK to access NVDIMMs.  They can work with files on  DAX
       filesystem (fsdax) or DAX device.

                     returns nothing

       The most mature and recommended engine to use for persistent use-cases is <b>cmap</b>.  It provides good perfor‐
       mance results and stability.

       Each engine can be manually turned on and off at build time, using CMake  options.   All  engines  listed
       here are enabled and ready to use.

       To  configure  an  engine, pmemkv_config is used (<b><a href="../man3/libpmemkv_config.3.html">libpmemkv_config</a></b>(3)).  Below is a list of engines along
       with config parameters they expect.  Each parameter has corresponding  function  (pmemkv_config_put_path,
       pmemkv_config_put_comparator,  etc.), which guarantees type safety.  For example to insert path parameter
       to the config, user should call pmemkv_config_put_path().  For some use cases, like creating config  from
       parsed input, it may be more convenient to insert parameters by their type instead of name.  Each parame‐
       ter  has  a  certain  type  and  may  be  inserted  to  a  config using appropriate function (pmemkv_con‐
       fig_put_string, pmemkv_config_put_int64, etc.).  For example, to  insert  a  parameter  of  type  string,
       pmemkv_config_put_string function may be used.  Those two ways of inserting parameters into config may be
       used interchangeably.

       For description of pmemkv core API see <b><a href="../man3/libpmemkv.3.html">libpmemkv</a></b>(3).

   <b>cmap</b>
       A persistent concurrent engine, backed by a hashmap that allows calling get, put, and remove concurrently
       from  multiple  threads and ensures good scalability.  Rest of the methods (e.g. range query methods) are
       not thread-safe and should not be called from more than one thread.  Data stored  using  this  engine  is
       persistent  and  guaranteed  to  be  consistent in case of any kind of interruption (crash / power loss /
       etc).

       Internally this engine uses persistent concurrent hashmap and persistent string from  libpmemobj-cpp  li‐
       brary (for details see &lt;https://github.com/pmem/libpmemobj-cpp&gt;).  Persistent string is used as a type of
       a key and a value.  Engine’s functions should not be called within libpmemobj transactions (improper call
       by user will result thrown exception).

       This  engine  requires  the  following  config parameters (see <b><a href="../man3/libpmemkv_config.3.html">libpmemkv_config</a></b>(3) for details how to set
       them):

       • <b>path</b> – Path to a database file or to a poolset file (see <b><a href="../man5/poolset.5.html">poolset</a></b>(5) for details).  Note that when using
         poolset file, size should be 0.  It’s used to open or create pool (layout “pmemkv”).

         • type: string

       • <b>create_if_missing</b> – If 1, pmemkv tries to open the pool and if that doesn’t succeed, it creates it.  If
         0, pmemkv will rely on <b>create_or_error_if_exists</b> flag setting.  If both <b>create_*</b> flags will be false  -
         pmemkv will open the pool (unless the path does not exist - then it’ll fail).

         • type: uint64_t

         • default value: 0

       • <b>create_or_error_if_exists</b>  –  If  1,  pmemkv creates the file (but it will fail if path exists).  If 0,
         pmemkv will rely on <b>create_if_missing</b> flag setting.  If both <b>create_*</b> flags will be false - pmemkv will
         open the pool (unless the path does not exist - then it’ll fail).

         • type: uint64_t

         • default value: 0

       • <b>size</b> – Only needed if any of the above flags is 1.  It specifies size of the  database  [in  bytes]  to
         create.

         • type: uint64_t

         • min value: 8388608 (8MB)

       • <b>oid</b>  – Pointer to oid (for details see <b><a href="../man7/libpmemobj.7.html">libpmemobj</a></b>(7)) which points to engine data.  If oid is null, en‐
         gine will allocate new data, otherwise it will use existing one.

         • type: object

       The following table shows four possible combinations of parameters (where `-' means `cannot be set'):

       <b>#</b>   <b>path</b>   <b>create_if_miss‐</b>   <b>create_or_er‐</b>   <b>size</b>   <b>oid</b>
                  <b>ing</b>               <b>ror_if_exists</b>
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>1</b>   set           0                0         N/A     -
       <b>2</b>   set           1                -         set     -
       <b>3</b>   set           -                1         set     -
       <b>4</b>    -           N/A              N/A        N/A    set

              <u>ad</u> <u>1</u>: If none of the flags are set (default flags’ value is false), pmemkv will only try  to  open
              the file and it fails if the path does not exist.  Size is ignored.

              <u>ad</u> <u>2</u>: If <b>create_if_missing</b> flag is set, pmemkv will try to open the file (based on path) and if it
              doesn’t succeed, pmemkv tries to create the file.  Flag <b>create_or_error_if_exists</b> can’t be set (or
              it should be set to 0).

              <u>ad</u>  <u>3</u>:  If <b>create_or_error_if_exists</b> flag is set, pmemkv will try to create the file (and fails if
              it exists).  Flag <b>create_if_missing</b> can’t be set (or it should be set to 0).

              <u>ad</u> <u>4</u>: If <b>oid</b> is set, path should not be set.  Both flags and size are ignored.

       A database file or a poolset file can also be created using <b>pmempool</b>  utility  (see  <b><a href="../man1/pmempool-create.1.html">pmempool-create</a></b>(1)).
       When  using  <b>pmempool</b>  <b>create</b>,  “pmemkv”  should be passed as layout for cmap engine and “pmemkv_&lt;engine-
       name&gt;” for other engines (e.g. “pmemkv_stree” for stree engine).  Only PMEMOBJ pools are supported.

   <b>vcmap</b>
       A volatile concurrent engine, backed by memkind.  Data written using this engine is lost  after  database
       is closed.

       This engine is built on top of tbb::concurrent_hash_map data structure and uses PMEM C++ allocator to al‐
       locate  memory.   std::basic_string is used as a type of a key and a value.  Memkind and TBB packages are
       required.

       This engine requires the following config parameters (see <b><a href="../man3/libpmemkv_config.3.html">libpmemkv_config</a></b>(3)  for  details  how  to  set
       them):

       • <b>path</b> – Path to an existing directory

         • type: string

       • <b>size</b> – Specifies size of the database [in bytes]

         • type: uint64_t

         • min value: 16777216 (16MB) (value MEMKIND_PMEM_MIN_SIZE is specified in memkind.h)

   <b>vsmap</b>
       A  volatile single-threaded sorted engine, backed by memkind.  Data written using this engine is lost af‐
       ter database is closed.

       This engine is built on top of std::map and  uses  PMEM  C++  allocator  to  allocate  memory.   std::ba‐
       sic_string is used as a type of a key and a value.  Memkind package is required.

       This  engine  requires  the  following  config parameters (see <b><a href="../man3/libpmemkv_config.3.html">libpmemkv_config</a></b>(3) for details how to set
       them):

       • <b>path</b> – Path to an existing directory

         • type: string

       • <b>size</b> – Specifies size of the database [in bytes]

         • type: uint64_t

         • min value: 16777216 (16MB) (value MEMKIND_PMEM_MIN_SIZE is specified in memkind.h)

       • <b>comparator</b> – (optional) Specified comparator used by the engine

         • type: object

   <b>blackhole</b>
       A volatile engine that accepts an unlimited amount of data,  but  never  returns  anything.   Internally,
       blackhole does not use a persistent pool or any durable structure.  The intended use of this engine is to
       profile and tune high-level bindings, and similar cases when persistence should be intentionally skipped.
       No additional packages are required.  No supported configuration parameters.

   <b>Experimental</b> <b>engines</b>
       There    are    also    more    engines   in   various   states   of   development,   for   details   see
       &lt;https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv/blob/master/doc/ENGINES-experimental.md&gt;.  Some of  them  (radix,  tree3,
       stree and csmap) requires the config parameters like cmap and similarly to cmap should not be used within
       libpmemobj transaction(s).
