       ycm-using - Using YCM in your project

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>USE</b> <b>YCM</b> <b>IN</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>PROJECT</b></h4><pre>
       In  order to use YCM in your project, your software will have to depend on CMake 3.12 or later. Therefore
       your   <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>   file   should   include   a   <b>cmake_minimum_required()</b>   call    to    set    the
       <b>CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION</b> and the relative CMake policies.

          cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.12)

       Now  you  have  to  set  variables that control which components are enabled (all the following variables
       should be set before calling <b>find_package(YCM)</b>, it is not possible to change their value later):

       By default, YCM makes available some modules from CMake, that received bugfix, enhancement, or simply are
       not available in all the supported versions.  If you want you can disable this behaviour by  setting  the
       :variable`YCM_USE_CMAKE_&lt;VERSION&gt;` and <u>YCM_USE_CMAKE_NEXT</u> variables to <b>OFF</b>.

          # set(YCM_USE_CMAKE_3_13 OFF) # Disable modules from CMake 3.13
          # set(YCM_USE_CMAKE_3_14 OFF) # Disable modules from CMake 3.14
          # set(YCM_USE_CMAKE_3_15 OFF) # Disable modules from CMake 3.15
          # set(YCM_USE_CMAKE_NEXT OFF) # Disable modules from CMake git repository

       These options, are turned on by default, but they can be turned off if they are not needed.

       <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
          <u>YCM_USE_CMAKE_&lt;VERSION&gt;</u>, <u>YCM_USE_CMAKE_NEXT</u>.

       YCM  contains  also some CMake modules with unmerged patches. These are turned off by default, but can be
       enabled using the <u>YCM_USE_CMAKE_PROPOSED</u> variable.

          set(YCM_USE_CMAKE_PROPOSED ON) # Enables unmerged patches to CMake modules

       These options, is turned on by default, but it can be turned  off  if  needed.   At  the  moment,  it  is
       recommended to turn it on for YCM superbuilds.

       <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
          <u>YCM_USE_CMAKE_PROPOSED</u>.

       All  the  <b>YCM_USE_CMAKE_</b>  options can be disabled simultaneously by setting the <u>YCM_USE_CMAKE</u> variable to
       <b>OFF</b>.

       <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
          <u>YCM_USE_CMAKE</u>.

       YCM makes available a few 3rd party modules. These modules can have licenses that are not the same as YCM
       license. If you are using these module, you should check each license to ensure  that  it  is  compatible
       with  your  code.  If you want to disable all 3rd party modules you can set the <u>YCM_USE_3RDPARTY</u> variable
       to <b>OFF</b>.

          # set(YCM_USE_3RDPARTY OFF) # Disable 3rd party modules

       Also this option is turned on by default, but it can be turned off if it is not needed.

       <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
          <u>YCM_USE_3RDPARTY</u>

       Finally, YCM makes available a few modules that are considered deprecated.  <u>YCM_USE_DEPRECATED</u>  variable.
       Please  note  that  these  modules  are  deprecated for a reason, therefore they are not supported, might
       contain bugs, and could be removed in future releases.  They are still available to support old code, but
       it is strongly recommended to avoid them in new code.  If you want to disable the deprecated modules, you
       can set the <u>YCM_USE_DEPRECATED</u> to <b>OFF</b>

          # set(YCM_USE_DEPRECATED OFF) # Disable deprecated modules

       <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
          <u>YCM_USE_DEPRECATED</u>

       YCM can be both a hard dependency or a soft dependency in your project.  In the first case, your  package
       will  not  build if the YCM package is not installed, in the second case, if it is not installed, it will
       be downloaded and built during the configure phase of your project.

   <b>Using</b> <b>YCM</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hard</b> <b>Dependency</b>
       In order to make it a hard dependency, you can just use it like any other package:

          # Find YCM
          find_package(YCM [version] REQUIRED)

       This is the recommended mode to use it when you just want to use YCM modules, because  in  this  way  you
       will not need a network connection when building the package.

   <b>Using</b> <b>YCM</b> <b>as</b> <b>Soft</b> <b>Dependency</b>
       In  order  to  make  it  a  soft  dependency, you will need to get the files <b>tools/YCMBootstrap.cmake</b> and
       <b>modules/IncludeUrl.cmake</b> from the YCM sources (see <u><a href="../man7/ycm-installing.7.html">ycm-installing</a>(7)</u> for instructions on how to  download
       YCM) and copy them inside your project tree:

          cd &lt;YOUR_PROJECT_DIR&gt;
          mkdir cmake
          cp &lt;PATH_TO_YCM_SOURCES&gt;/tools/YCMBootstrap.cmake cmake
          cp modules/IncludeUrl.cmake cmake

       These files must be in a folder included in <b>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</b> for your project:

          list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake")

       Now you can include <b>YCMBootstrap.cmake</b>:

          # Uncomment the next line to specify a tag or a version.
          # set(YCM_TAG [tag, branch, or commit hash])

          # Bootstrap YCM
          include(YCMBootstrap)

       This  is  the  suggested method when you build a superbuild. Downloading all your project would require a
       network connection anyway, therefore you will need to install.

       In both cases, you can use YCM modules right after this declaration.
