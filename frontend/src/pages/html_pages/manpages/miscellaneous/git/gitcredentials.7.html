</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gitcredentials - Providing usernames and passwords to Git

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       git config credential.https://example.com.username myusername
       git config credential.helper "$helper $options"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Git will sometimes need credentials from the user in order to perform operations; for example, it may
       need to ask for a username and password in order to access a remote repository over HTTP. Some remotes
       accept a personal access token or OAuth access token as a password. This manual describes the mechanisms
       Git uses to request these credentials, as well as some features to avoid inputting these credentials
       repeatedly.

</pre><h4><b>REQUESTING</b> <b>CREDENTIALS</b></h4><pre>
       Without any credential helpers defined, Git will try the following strategies to ask the user for
       usernames and passwords:

        1. If the <b>GIT_ASKPASS</b> environment variable is set, the program specified by the variable is invoked. A
           suitable prompt is provided to the program on the command line, and the user’s input is read from its
           standard output.

        2. Otherwise, if the <b>core.askPass</b> configuration variable is set, its value is used as above.

        3. Otherwise, if the <b>SSH_ASKPASS</b> environment variable is set, its value is used as above.

        4. Otherwise, the user is prompted on the terminal.

</pre><h4><b>AVOIDING</b> <b>REPETITION</b></h4><pre>
       It can be cumbersome to input the same credentials over and over. Git provides two methods to reduce this
       annoyance:

        1. Static configuration of usernames for a given authentication context.

        2. Credential helpers to cache or store passwords, or to interact with a system password wallet or
           keychain.

       The first is simple and appropriate if you do not have secure storage available for a password. It is
       generally configured by adding this to your config:

           [credential "https://example.com"]
                   username = me

       Credential helpers, on the other hand, are external programs from which Git can request both usernames
       and passwords; they typically interface with secure storage provided by the OS or other programs.
       Alternatively, a credential-generating helper might generate credentials for certain servers via some
       API.

       To use a helper, you must first select one to use (see below for a list).

       You may also have third-party helpers installed; search for <b>credential-*</b> in the output of <b>git</b> <b>help</b> <b>-a</b>,
       and consult the documentation of individual helpers. Once you have selected a helper, you can tell Git to
       use it by putting its name into the credential.helper variable.

        1. Find a helper.

               $ git help -a | grep credential-
               credential-foo

        2. Read its description.

               $ git help credential-foo

        3. Tell Git to use it.

               $ git config --global credential.helper foo

   <b>Available</b> <b>helpers</b>
       Git currently includes the following helpers:

       cache
           Cache credentials in memory for a short period of time. See <b><a href="../man1/git-credential-cache.1.html">git-credential-cache</a></b>(1) for details.

       store
           Store credentials indefinitely on disk. See <b><a href="../man1/git-credential-store.1.html">git-credential-store</a></b>(1) for details.

       Popular helpers with secure persistent storage include:

       •   git-credential-libsecret (Linux)

       •   git-credential-osxkeychain (macOS)

       •   git-credential-wincred (Windows)

       •   <b>Git</b> <b>Credential</b> <b>Manager</b>[1] (cross platform, included in Git for Windows)

       The community maintains a comprehensive list of Git credential helpers at
       <b>https://git-scm.com/doc/credential-helpers</b>.

   <b>OAuth</b>
       An alternative to inputting passwords or personal access tokens is to use an OAuth credential helper.
       Initial authentication opens a browser window to the host. Subsequent authentication happens in the
       background. Many popular Git hosts support OAuth.

       Popular helpers with OAuth support include:

       •   <b>Git</b> <b>Credential</b> <b>Manager</b>[1] (cross platform, included in Git for Windows)

       •   <b>git-credential-oauth</b>[2] (cross platform, included in many Linux distributions)

       •   <b>git-credential-gmail</b>[3] (cross platform, dedicated helper to authenticate Gmail accounts for <b><a href="../man1/gitsend-email.1.html">git-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man1/gitsend-email.1.html">send-email</a></b>(1))

       •   <b>git-credential-outlook</b>[3] (cross platform, dedicated helper to authenticate Microsoft Outlook
           accounts for <b><a href="../man1/git-send-email.1.html">git-send-email</a></b>(1))

</pre><h4><b>CREDENTIAL</b> <b>CONTEXTS</b></h4><pre>
       Git considers each credential to have a context defined by a URL. This context is used to look up
       context-specific configuration, and is passed to any helpers, which may use it as an index into secure
       storage.

       For instance, imagine we are accessing <b>https://example.com/foo.git</b>. When Git looks into a config file to
       see if a section matches this context, it will consider the two a match if the context is a more-specific
       subset of the pattern in the config file. For example, if you have this in your config file:

           [credential "https://example.com"]
                   username = foo

       then we will match: both protocols are the same, both hosts are the same, and the "pattern" URL does not
       care about the path component at all. However, this context would not match:

           [credential "https://kernel.org"]
                   username = foo

       because the hostnames differ. Nor would it match <b>foo.example.com</b>; Git compares hostnames exactly, without
       considering whether two hosts are part of the same domain. Likewise, a config entry for
       <b><a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a></b> would not match: Git compares the protocols exactly. However, you may use wildcards in
       the domain name and other pattern matching techniques as with the <b>http.</b><u>&lt;URL&gt;</u><b>.*</b> options.

       If the "pattern" URL does include a path component, then this too must match exactly: the context
       <b>https://example.com/bar/baz.git</b> will match a config entry for <b>https://example.com/bar/baz.git</b> (in
       addition to matching the config entry for <b>https://example.com</b>) but will not match a config entry for
       <b>https://example.com/bar</b>.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options for a credential context can be configured either in <b>credential.*</b> (which applies to all
       credentials), or <b>credential.</b><u>&lt;URL&gt;</u><b>.*</b>, where &lt;URL&gt; matches the context as described above.

       The following options are available in either location:

       helper
           The name of an external credential helper, and any associated options. If the helper name is not an
           absolute path, then the string <b>git</b> <b>credential-</b> is prepended. The resulting string is executed by the
           shell (so, for example, setting this to <b>foo</b> <b>--option=bar</b> will execute <b>git</b> <b>credential-foo</b> <b>--option=bar</b>
           via the shell. See the manual of specific helpers for examples of their use.

           If there are multiple instances of the <b>credential.helper</b> configuration variable, each helper will be
           tried in turn, and may provide a username, password, or nothing. Once Git has acquired both a
           username and a non-expired password, no more helpers will be tried.

           If <b>credential.helper</b> is configured to the empty string, this resets the helper list to empty (so you
           may override a helper set by a lower-priority config file by configuring the empty-string helper,
           followed by whatever set of helpers you would like).

       username
           A default username, if one is not provided in the URL.

       useHttpPath
           By default, Git does not consider the "path" component of an http URL to be worth matching via
           external helpers. This means that a credential stored for <b>https://example.com/foo.git</b> will also be
           used for <b>https://example.com/bar.git</b>. If you do want to distinguish these cases, set this option to
           <b>true</b>.

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOM</b> <b>HELPERS</b></h4><pre>
       You can write your own custom helpers to interface with any system in which you keep credentials.

       Credential helpers are programs executed by Git to fetch or save credentials from and to long-term
       storage (where "long-term" is simply longer than a single Git process; e.g., credentials may be stored
       in-memory for a few minutes, or indefinitely on disk).

       Each helper is specified by a single string in the configuration variable <b>credential.helper</b> (and others,
       see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)). The string is transformed by Git into a command to be executed using these rules:

        1. If the helper string begins with "!", it is considered a shell snippet, and everything after the "!"
           becomes the command.

        2. Otherwise, if the helper string begins with an absolute path, the verbatim helper string becomes the
           command.

        3. Otherwise, the string "git credential-" is prepended to the helper string, and the result becomes the
           command.

       The resulting command then has an "operation" argument appended to it (see below for details), and the
       result is executed by the shell.

       Here are some example specifications:

           # run "git credential-foo"
           [credential]
                   helper = foo

           # same as above, but pass an argument to the helper
           [credential]
                   helper = "foo --bar=baz"

           # the arguments are parsed by the shell, so use shell
           # quoting if necessary
           [credential]
                   helper = "foo --bar='whitespace arg'"

           # store helper (discouraged) with custom location for the db file;
           # use `--file <a href="file:~/.git-secret.txt">~/.git-secret.txt</a>`, rather than `--file=<a href="file:~/.git-secret.txt">~/.git-secret.txt</a>`,
           # to allow the shell to expand tilde to the home directory.
           [credential]
                   helper = "store --file <a href="file:~/.git-secret.txt">~/.git-secret.txt</a>"

           # you can also use an absolute path, which will not use the git wrapper
           [credential]
                   helper = "/path/to/my/helper --with-arguments"

           # or you can specify your own shell snippet
           [credential "https://example.com"]
                   username = your_user
                   helper = "!f() { test \"$1\" = get &amp;&amp; echo \"password=$(cat $HOME/.secret)\"; }; f"

       Generally speaking, rule (3) above is the simplest for users to specify. Authors of credential helpers
       should make an effort to assist their users by naming their program "git-credential-$NAME", and putting
       it in the <b>$PATH</b> or <b>$GIT_EXEC_PATH</b> during installation, which will allow a user to enable it with <b>git</b>
       <b>config</b> <b>credential.helper</b> <b>$NAME</b>.

       When a helper is executed, it will have one "operation" argument appended to its command line, which is
       one of:

       <b>get</b>
           Return a matching credential, if any exists.

       <b>store</b>
           Store the credential, if applicable to the helper.

       <b>erase</b>
           Remove matching credentials, if any, from the helper’s storage.

       The details of the credential will be provided on the helper’s stdin stream. The exact format is the same
       as the input/output format of the <b>git</b> <b>credential</b> plumbing command (see the section <b>INPUT/OUTPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b> in
       <b><a href="../man1/git-credential.1.html">git-credential</a></b>(1) for a detailed specification).

       For a <b>get</b> operation, the helper should produce a list of attributes on stdout in the same format (see
       <b><a href="../man1/git-credential.1.html">git-credential</a></b>(1) for common attributes). A helper is free to produce a subset, or even no values at all
       if it has nothing useful to provide. Any provided attributes will overwrite those already known about by
       Git’s credential subsystem. Unrecognised attributes are silently discarded.

       While it is possible to override all attributes, well behaving helpers should refrain from doing so for
       any attribute other than username and password.

       If a helper outputs a <b>quit</b> attribute with a value of <b>true</b> or <b>1</b>, no further helpers will be consulted, nor
       will the user be prompted (if no credential has been provided, the operation will then fail).

       Similarly, no more helpers will be consulted once both username and password had been provided.

       For a <b>store</b> or <b>erase</b> operation, the helper’s output is ignored.

       If a helper fails to perform the requested operation or needs to notify the user of a potential issue, it
       may write to stderr.

       If it does not support the requested operation (e.g., a read-only store or generator), it should silently
       ignore the request.

       If a helper receives any other operation, it should silently ignore the request. This leaves room for
       future operations to be added (older helpers will just ignore the new requests).
