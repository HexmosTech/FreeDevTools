       mh-sequence - sequence specification for mh message system

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  sequence  (or  sequence set) is a symbolic name representing a message or collection of messages.  <b>mmh</b>
       has several internally defined sequences, as well as allowing users to define their own sequences.

   <b>Message</b> <b>Specification</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pre-Defined</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Sequences</b>
       Most <b>mmh</b> commands accept a `msg' or `msgs' specification, where `msg' indicates one  message  and  `msgs'
       indicates one or more messages.  To designate a message, you may use either its number (e.g., 1, 10, 234)
       or one of these `reserved' message names:

            <u>Name</u>      <u>Description</u>
            f         the first message in the folder
            p         the message numerically preceding `c'
            c         the most recently accessed message
            n         the message numerically following `c'
            l         the last message in the folder

       In commands that take a `msg' argument, the default is `c'.

       For  example:  In  a folder containing five messages numbered 5, 10, 94, 177 and 325, `f' is 5 and `l' is
       325.  If `c' is 94, then `p' is 10 and `n' is 177.

       The word `msgs' indicates that one or more messages may be specified.  Such a specification  consists  of
       one  message  designation  or of several message designations separated by spaces.  A message designation
       consists either of a message name as defined above, or a message range.

       A message range is specified as `name1-name2' or `name:i', where `name', `name1' and `name2' are  message
       names, and `i' is an integer.

       The  specification  `name1-name2'  designates  all  currently  existing  messages from `name1' to `name2'
       inclusive.  The `reserved' message name `a' (``all'') is a shorthand for the message range `f-l'.

            <u>Name</u>      <u>Description</u>
            a         all messages in the folder (i.e. `f-l')

       The specification `name:i' designates up to `i' messages.  These messages start with `name' if `name'  is
       a  message number or one of the reserved names `f' `c', or `n', The messages end with `name' if `name' is
       `p' or `l'.  The interpretation of `i' may be overridden by preceding `i' with a plus or minus sign; `+i'
       always means up to `i' messages starting with `name', and `-i' always means up  to  `i'  messages  ending
       with `name'.

       In  commands  which  accept a `msgs' argument, the default is either `c' or `a', depending on which makes
       more sense for each command (see the individual man pages for details).

       Repeated specifications of the same message have the  same  effect  as  a  single  specification  of  the
       message.

       There  is  also  a  special  `reserved'  message  name `b' (``beyond'') which can be used with the <b>mhpath</b>
       command. It refers to the next (not yet used) message number after `l'.

            <u>Name</u>      <u>Description</u>
            b         the next message number beyond `l'

   <b>User-Defined</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Sequences</b>
       In addition to the `reserved' (pre-defined) message names given above, <b>mmh</b> supports user-defined sequence
       names.  User-defined sequences allow the <b>mmh</b> user a tremendous amount of power in dealing with groups  of
       messages  in  the  same  folder by allowing the user to bind a group of messages to a meaningful symbolic
       name.

       The name used to denote a message sequence must consist of an alphabetic character followed  by  zero  or
       more alphanumeric characters, and can not be one of the `reserved' message names above.  After defining a
       sequence, it can be used wherever an <b>mmh</b> command expects a `msg' or `msgs' argument.

       Some  forms of message ranges are allowed with user-defined sequences.  The specification `name:i' may be
       used, and it designates up to the first `i' messages (or last `i' messages for `-i') which  are  elements
       of the user-defined sequence `name'.

       The  specifications  `name:n'  and  `name:p'  may  also  be used, and they designate the next or previous
       message (relative to the current message) which is an element of the user-defined sequence  `name'.   The
       specifications  `name:f'  and  `name:l'  are  equivalent  to  `name:1'  and `name:-1', respectively.  The
       specification `name:c' is not allowed (use just `c' instead).  Note: The syntax of  these  message  range
       specifications is subject to change in the future.

       User-defined  sequence  names  are  specific  to  each  folder.  They are defined using the <b>pick</b> and <b>mark</b>
       commands.

   <b>Public</b> <b>and</b> <b>Private</b> <b>User-Defined</b> <b>Sequences</b>
       There are two varieties of user-defined sequences: public and private.  Public sequences of a folder  are
       accessible  to  any  <b>mmh</b>  user  that  can  read  that  folder.   They are kept in each folder in the file
       determined by the `Mh-Sequences'  profile  entry  (default  is  <u>.mh_sequences</u>).   Private  sequences  are
       accessible only to the <b>mmh</b> user that defined those sequences and are kept in the user's <b>mh</b> context file.

       In  general,  the  commands that create sequences (such as <b>pick</b> and <b>mark</b>) will create public sequences if
       the folder for which the sequences are being defined is writable by the <b>mmh</b>  user.   For  most  commands,
       this can be overridden by using the switches <b>-public</b> and <b>-private</b>.  But if the folder is read-only, or if
       the `Mh-Sequences' profile entry is defined but empty, then <u>private</u> sequences will be created instead.

   <b>Sequence</b> <b>Negation</b>
       <b>Mmh</b>  provides  the  ability  to  select  all messages <b>not</b> elements of a user-defined sequence.  A special
       string is used to preface an existing user-defined sequence name.   This  specification  then  refers  to
       those  messages  not  elements  of  the  specified  sequence  name.   The  default negation prefix is the
       exlamation mark `!', but it may be change to any string, by defining the entry `Sequence-Negation' in the
       <b>mmh</b> profile file.  For example, if the profile entry is:

            Sequence-Negation: not

       then anytime an <b>mmh</b> command is given `notfoo' as a `msg' or `msgs'  argument,  it  would  substitute  all
       messages that are not elements of the sequence `foo'.

       Obviously,  the  user  should  beware  of  defining sequences with names that begin with the value of the
       `Sequence-Negation' profile entry.  The default value `!' was chosen due to its similar meaning in the  C
       programming  language,  and  because  it  cannot  be  part  of a user-defined sequence. But if your shell
       provides history expansion, you might need to quote the exlamation mark (prefix it with a backslash).

       To deactivate the negation mechanism, define Sequence-Negation in your profile to an empty value.

   <b>The</b> <b>Previous</b> <b>Sequence</b>
       <b>Mmh</b> provides the ability to remember the `msgs' or `msg' argument last given  to  an  <b>mmh</b>  command.   The
       entry  `Previous-Sequence'  should  be defined in the <b>mmh</b> profile; its value should be a sequence name or
       multiple sequence names separated by spaces.  If this entry is defined, when an <b>mmh</b> command finishes,  it
       will  define the sequence(s) named in the value of this entry to be those messages that were specified to
       the command.  Hence, a profile entry of

            Previous-Sequence: pseq

       directs any <b>mmh</b> command that accepts a `msg' or `msgs' argument to define the sequence  `pseq'  as  those
       messages when it finishes.

       <b>Note</b>:  there  can be a performance penalty in using the `Previous-Sequence' facility.  If it is used, <b>all</b>
       <b>mmh</b> programs have to write the sequence information to the <u>.mh_sequences</u> file for the  folder  each  time
       they run.  If the `Previous-Sequence' profile entry is not included, only <b>pick</b> and <b>mark</b> will write to the
       <b>.mh_sequences</b> file.

   <b>The</b> <b>Unseen</b> <b>Sequence</b>
       Finally,  the  unseen  sequence  indicates which messages have not been previously seen by the user.  The
       commands <b>inc</b>, <b>rcvstore</b>, <b>show</b>, and <b>flist</b> honor the sequence.  Whenever new messages are placed in a folder
       (using <b>inc</b> or <b>rcvstore</b>), the new messages will also be added to the unseen sequence.

       <b>inc</b>, for example, adds new messages to  the  unseen  sequence.   Unlike  the  behavior  of  the  previous
       sequence, however, the unseen sequence will <b>not</b> be zeroed by <b>inc</b>.

       Similarly,  whenever  <b>show</b>, <b>next</b>, or <b>prev</b> display a message, that message will be removed from the unseen
       sequence.

       The default unseen sequence is named `u'.  To change, define a `Unseen-Sequence' entry in  your  profile.
       It may also contain multiple sequence names, separated by spaces.  In this case, anything that applied to
       a single unseen sequence, applies to multiple ones, too.

       The unseen sequence mechanism is automatically activated.  To deactivate it, define the `Unseen-Sequence'
       entry in your profile with an empty value.
