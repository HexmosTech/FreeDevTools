</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SET MOVE SEQUENCE - Move a sequence from one Slony-I replication set to another

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SET</b> <b>MOVE</b> <b>SEQUENCE</b> <b>(options);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Change the set a sequence belongs to. The current set and the new set must originate on the same node and
       subscribed by the same nodes.
              <b>Caution</b>

              Due  to  the  way  subscribing to new sets works make absolutely sure that the subscription of all
              nodes to the sets is completely processed before moving sequences. Moving a sequence too early  to
              a  new  set  causes  the  subscriber  to  try and add the sequence already during the subscription
              process, which fails with a duplicate key error and breaks replication.

       ORIGIN = ival
              Origin node for the set. A future version of slonik might figure out this information by itself.

       ID = ival
              Unique ID of the sequence.

       NEW SET = ival
              Unique ID of the set to which the sequence should be moved.

       This uses “schemadocsetmovesequence(p_new_set_id integer, p_seq_id integer)”  [not  available  as  a  man
       page].

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       SET MOVE SEQUENCE (
           ORIGIN = 1,
           ID = 20,
           NEW SET = 3
       );

</pre><h4><b>LOCKING</b> <b>BEHAVIOUR</b></h4><pre>
       No application-visible locking should take place.

</pre><h4><b>SLONIK</b> <b>EVENT</b> <b>CONFIRMATION</b> <b>BEHAVIOUR</b></h4><pre>
       Slonik  waits for the command submitted to the previous event node to be confirmed on the specified event
       node before submitting this command.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       This command was introduced in Slony-I 1.0.5
