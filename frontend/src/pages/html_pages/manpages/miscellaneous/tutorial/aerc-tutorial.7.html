       aerc-tutorial - tutorial for <b><a href="../man1/aerc.1.html">aerc</a></b>(1)

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       Welcome to aerc! This tutorial will guide you through your first steps in using the client. This tutorial
       is a man page - you can read it again later with <b>:help</b> <u>tutorial</u> from aerc, or <b>man</b> <b>aerc-tutorial</b> from your
       terminal.

       First, let's introduce some basic keybindings. For convention, we'll use <b>&lt;C-p&gt;</b> to represent <u>Ctrl+p</u>, which
       matches the convention used for writing keybindings for aerc.

       <b>&lt;C-p&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;C-n&gt;</b>
           Cycles to the previous or next tab

       Try  using  these  now to switch between your message list and the tutorial. In your message list, we use
       vim-style keys to get around.

       <b>k</b>, <b>j</b>
           Scrolls up and down between messages

       <b>&lt;C-u&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;C-d&gt;</b>
           Scrolls half a page up or down

       <b>g</b>, <b>G</b>
           Selects the first or last message, respectively

       <b>K</b>, <b>J</b>
           Switches between folders in the sidebar

       <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b>
           Opens the selected message

       You can also search the selected folder with <b>/</b>, or filter with <b>\</b> . When searching you can use <b>n</b> and <b>p</b>  to
       jump to the next and previous result. Filtering hides any non-matching message.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>MESSAGE</b> <b>VIEWER</b></h4><pre>
       Press  <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b> to open a message. By default, the message viewer will display your message using <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1).
       This should also have familiar, vim-like keybindings for scrolling around in your message.

       Multipart messages (messages with attachments, or messages with several alternative formats) show a  part
       selector on the bottom of the message viewer.

       <b>&lt;C-k&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;C-j&gt;</b>
           Cycle between parts of a multipart message

       <b>q</b>
           Close the message viewer

       To  show  HTML  messages  parts,  the  <u>text/html</u>  filter  in  your  <u>aerc.conf</u>  file (which is probably in
       <u><a href="file:~/.config/aerc/">~/.config/aerc/</a></u>) requires <b>w3m</b> along with optional dependencies for safer network isolation: <b>unshare</b> (from
       <b>util-linux</b>) or <b>socksify</b> (from <b>dante-utils</b>).

       You can also do many tasks you could do in the message list from here, like replying to emails,  deleting
       the email, or view the next and previous message (<b>J</b> and <b>K</b>).

</pre><h4><b>COMPOSING</b> <b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       Return  to  the  message  list  by  pressing <b>q</b> to dismiss the message viewer. Once there, let's compose a
       message.

       <b>C</b>
           Compose a new message

       <b>rr</b>
           Reply-all to a message

       <b>rq</b>
           Reply-all to a message, and pre-fill the editor with a quoted version of the message being replied to

       <b>Rr</b>
           Reply to a message

       <b>Rq</b>
           Reply to a message, and pre-fill the editor with a quoted version of the message being replied to

       For now, let's use <b>C</b> to compose a new message. The message composer will appear. You should see To, From,
       and Subject lines, as well as your <b>$EDITOR</b>. You can use <b>&lt;Tab&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;C-j&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;C-k&gt;</b> to cycle  between  these
       fields (tab won't cycle between fields once you enter the editor, but <b>&lt;C-j&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;C-k&gt;</b> will).

       Let's  send  an email to yourself. Note that the To and From headers expect RFC 5322 addresses, e.g. <b>John</b>
       <b>Doe</b> <b>&lt;<a href="mailto:john@example.org">john@example.org</a>&gt;</b>, or simply <b>&lt;<a href="mailto:john@example.org">john@example.org</a>&gt;</b>. Separate multiple recipients with commas. Go  ahead
       and fill out an email, then close the editor.

       The  message  review  screen  is  shown next. You have a chance now to revise the email before it's sent.
       Press <b>y</b> to send the email if it looks good.

       <b>Note</b>: when using the terminal in the message view, you can summon aerc's ex command line by using  <b>&lt;C-x&gt;</b>.
       <b>:</b> is sent to the editor.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>TERMINAL</b></h4><pre>
       aerc  comes with an embedded terminal, which you've already used to view and edit emails. We can also use
       this for other purposes, such as referencing a git repository while reviewing a patch. From  the  message
       list, we can use the following keybindings to open a terminal:

       <b>&lt;C-t&gt;</b>
           Opens a new terminal tab, running your shell

       <b>$</b>, <b>!</b>
           Prompts for a command to run, then opens a new terminal tab running that command

       <b>|</b>
           Prompts for a command to run, then pipes the selected email into that command and displays the result
           on a new terminal tab

       Try pressing <b>$</b> and entering <u>top</u>. You can also use the <b>:cd</b> command to change aerc's working directory, and
       the directory in which new terminals run. Use <b>:pwd</b> to see it again if you're not sure where you are.

</pre><h4><b>ADDITIONAL</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>COMMANDS</b>
       Every keybinding is ultimately bound to an aerc command. You can also summon the command line by pressing
       <b>:</b>, then entering one of these commands. See <b><a href="../man1/aerc.1.html">aerc</a></b>(1) or <b>:help</b> for a full list of commands.

   <b>MESSAGE</b> <b>FILTERS</b>
       When  displaying messages in the message viewer, aerc will pipe them through a message filter first. This
       allows you to decode messages in non-plaintext formats, add syntax highlighting, etc. aerc ships  with  a
       few default filters:

       •   <u>text/plain</u>  parts  are  piped through the <u>colorize</u> built-in filter which handles URL, quotes and diff
           coloring.
       •   <u>text/calendar</u> is processed to be human readable text
       •   <u>text/html</u> (disabled by default) can be uncommented to pipe through the built-in <u>html</u> filter.

   <b>CUSTOMIZING</b> <b>AERC</b>
       Aerc is highly customizable. Review <b><a href="../man5/aerc-config.5.html">aerc-config</a></b>(5) (or use <b>:help</b> <b>config</b>) to learn more about how  to  add
       custom keybindings, install new message filters, change its appearance and behavior, and so on.
