       cupt_tutorial - tutorial for cupt package manager

</pre><h4><b>PREFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Abstract</b>
       Cupt is a high-level package manager for Debian and Debian-derived OSes, with <u><a href="../man1/dpkg.1.html">dpkg</a>(1)</u> as a back-end.

       The  aim  of  this  manual is to describe the all features Cupt package manager has to manage the system,
       from the most basics to very advanced tuning. Please submit your proposals/patches when you see some  use
       case is not covered.

       This manual was written for the second major version of Cupt (2.x branch).

   <b>Disadvantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>advantages</b>
       You might not want to use Cupt, because:

              •  Cupt is "unofficial" package manager. Currently, nothing in Debian ecosystem uses Cupt. It also
                 means  you won't get a support for it on most of Debian resources (you can however file bugs or
                 join IRC channel, see <u><a href="../man1/cupt.1.html">cupt</a>(1)/Reporting</u>).

              •  Cupt is not very well tested by users yet. Its userbase is relatively small.  However, you  are
                 invited to test it and increase the number of users.

              •  Some features which are present in other high-level package managers are missing.

                 Among  them:  multiarch,  GUI  and  TUI  interfaces, cdrom:// URI download method, repositories
                 without a Release file, integration with <u><a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron</a>(8)</u>. And there are probably many more.

       You might want to use Cupt to have these, to my best knowledge, unique features:

              •  integration with debdelta (binary package deltas)

              •  synchronization by source versions

              •  strict, full-case, configurable problem resolver

              •  full tree errors for unresolvable dependency problems

              •  package manager shell

              •  satisfy subcommand

              •  changeset-based system modifications for systems with low free disk space

              •  option name checker (for the 'cupt::*' option family)

              •  dpkg action sequences with heuristics to make an average number of packages in  interim  states
                 low

       Also,  one  of  Cupt's  targets  is  to  have  zero  non-wishlist  bugs.  You might want to try it if you
       encountered a bug in other package manager(s).

   <b>Infrastructure</b>
       Out of existing APT infrastructure, Cupt uses (and shares):

              •  remote repositories and <u><a href="../man5/sources.list.5.html">sources.list</a>(5)</u>

              •  ".deb" archives' cache

              •  configuration (<u><a href="../man5/apt.conf.5.html">apt.conf</a>(5)</u>)

              •  preferences (<u><a href="../man5/apt_preferences.5.html">apt_preferences</a>(5)</u>)

              •  database of automatically installed packages

       The following infrastructure items are Cupt-specific:

              •  local cache of repository metadata (since version 2.1.0)

              •  Cupt-specific configuration (<u><a href="../man5/cupt.conf.5.html">cupt.conf</a>(5)</u>)

              •  system snapshots

   <b>Getting</b> <b>started</b>
       To start working with Cupt just install it using  any  present  package  manager  (for  example,  <b>apt-get</b>
       <b>install</b> <b>cupt</b> or <b>aptitude</b> <b>install</b> <b>cupt</b>) and run <b>cupt</b> <b>update</b> afterwards.

       It should be safe to co-use Cupt and any APT-based package managers.

       When  using commands that modify a system, you have to either execute <b>cupt</b> with root privileges or supply
       <b>--simulate</b> (or <b>-s</b>) option.

       Use <b>cupt</b> <b>help</b> to get a list of subcommands and their short descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>BASICS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>The</b> <b>debian</b> <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>Cupt</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b>
       Cupt package manager sees the Debian system as a set of installed packages and repositories of  available
       packages.

       Each binary package has zero, one or more versions, of which zero or one versions may be installed.

       Any  installed  package  may be marked as <b>automatically</b> <b>installed</b>, it means that user didn't ask for this
       package to be  installed,  but  it  is  needed  to  satisfy  some  dependency.  Packages  which  are  not
       automatically installed are <b>manually</b> <b>installed</b>.

       Available  versions  (including  installed  one) of the binary package have unique version strings. Since
       Cupt 2.6, Cupt-specific version string suffixes (for example, <b>^installed</b> or <b>^dhs0</b>) may be  applied.  More
       details on this here.

   <b>Errors</b> <b>and</b> <b>warnings</b>
       Cupt uses three types of output to user: information, warnings and errors.

       All warning messages are prepended with <b>W:</b>. They mean non-critical errors, which may be, depending on the
       situation, real errors or things to ignore.

       All error messages are prepended with <b>E:</b>. Most of errors block the executing of the program, but not all.

       Errors and warnings are written to the standard error.

       All other messages are the information for the user. They are written to standard output.

   <b>Exploring</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b>
   <b>what</b> <b>packages</b> <b>are</b> <b>installed?</b>
       <b>cupt</b> <b>pkgnames</b> <b>--installed-only</b>

       gives you the list, one package name per line. You can also use

       <b>dpkg</b> <b>-l</b> <b>|</b> <b>grep</b> <b>"^ii"</b>

       for more detailed information.

   <b>getting</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>installed</b> <b>package</b>
       <b>dpkg</b> <b>-s</b> <u>package_name</u>

       or

       <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>--installed-only</b> <u>package_name</u>

       A  second  command  is  preferable,  for  example,  when  you  want to know is this package automatically
       installed or not.

   <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>available</b> <b>package</b> <b>versions</b>
       To show a default package version:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <u>package_name</u>

       Example: <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>dpkg</b>

       To show all available package versions:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>--all-versions</b> <u>package_name</u>

       If you want to see a Debian changelog for a package, use the subcommand <b>changelog</b>.

       Example: <b>cupt</b> <b>changelog</b> <b>exim4</b>

       If you want to see a Debian copyright file a for a package, use the subcommand <b>copyright</b>.

       Example: <b>cupt</b> <b>copyright</b> <b>exim4</b>

       Note: Cupt can show changelogs and copyrights either for installed packages, or for packages available in
       official repositories in Debian or Ubuntu.

   <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>package</b>
       To search for a package, specify one or more regular expressions as arguments:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>search</b> <u>keyword1</u> <u>keyword2</u> ... <u>keywordN</u>

       Example: you want to find a Qt-based audio player:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>search</b> <b>audio</b> <b>qt</b> <b>player</b>: found qmmp.

       <b>cupt</b> <b>search</b> <b>music</b> <b>qt</b> <b>player</b>: found also amarok.

       Another example: you want to find GTK+-related Perl modules:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>search</b> <b>--names-only</b> <b>"gtk.*perl"</b>

   <b>Updating</b> <b>repository</b> <b>metadata</b>
       To update repository medadata, use

       <b>cupt</b> <b>update</b>

       It's recommended to update metadata every time before you install or upgrade packages.

       Note: Cupt downloads quite a many files to update repository metadata. Some files may  be  downloaded  in
       2-3  different  ways (like indexes) or are not so important (like translations for package descriptions).
       You may see some warnings, but if you don't see an error message like

       <b>E:</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>errors</b> <b>while</b> <b>downloading</b> <b>release</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>data</b>

       , the process overall went fine. You can also check program exit code.

   <b>Modifying</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b>
   <b>package</b> <b>actions</b> <b>terminology</b>
       When some package is changing its state, Cupt calls the action:

       install

              when a package which wasn't installed is now going to be installed

       remove

              when a package will be removed

       upgrade

              when a new (bigger) version of the already installed package is to be installed

       downgrade

              when an old (more less) version of the already installed package is to be installed

       purge

              when a package and its configuration files will be removed

   <b>action</b> <b>preview</b> <b>prompt</b>
       An example of action preview prompt:

       $ cupt install kdm akregator exim4

       The following packages will be installed:

       exim4 exim4-base exim4-config exim4-daemon-light

       The following packages will be upgraded:

       kde-window-manager kdebase-workspace-bin kdebase-workspace-data
       kdebase-workspace-kgreet-plugins kdm ksysguard ksysguardd libkdecorations4
       libkephal4abi1 libkscreensaver5 libksgrd4 libksignalplotter4
       libkwineffects1abi1 libkworkspace4 libplasma-geolocation-interface4
       libplasmaclock4abi1 libplasmagenericshell4 libprocesscore4abi1 libprocessui4a
       libsolidcontrol4abi1 libsolidcontrolifaces4abi1 libtaskmanager4abi1
       libweather-ion6 plasma-dataengines-workspace plasma-desktop
       plasma-widgets-workspace

       The following packages will be removed:

       libgsasl7 libntlm0 msmtp msmtp-mta

       Action summary:
         1 manually installed and 3 automatically installed packages will be installed
         1 manually installed and 25 automatically installed packages will be upgraded
         1 manually installed and 3 automatically installed packages will be removed

       Need to get 25.7MiB/83.4MiB of archives. After unpacking 3512KiB will be used.
       Do you want to continue? [y/N/q/a/?]

       In the output above you can see: lists of packages to change the state, the summary of  planned  changes,
       the  total  download  amount  of packages (83.4MiB), the download amount considering the cache of already
       downloaded archives (25.7MiB), an estimate of difference in disk usage after the  actions  (+3512KiB),  a
       user prompt what to do.

       The following answers to a user prompt are available:

   <b>installing</b> <b>packages</b>
       To install a package:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <u>package_name</u>

       Example: <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>exim4</b>

       To install several packages:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <u>package_name_1</u> <u>package_name_2</u> ... <u>package_name_N</u>

       Example: <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>exim4</b> <b>kvirc</b> <b>kdm</b>

   <b>upgrading</b> <b>packages</b>
       To upgrade one or more installed packages, use the same commands as for installing packages.

   <b>removing</b> <b>packages</b>
       To remove a package:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>remove</b> <u>package_name</u>

       Example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>remove</b> <b>gdb</b>

       To remove several packages:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>remove</b> <u>package_name_1</u> <u>package_name_2</u> ... <u>package_name_N</u>

       Example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>remove</b> <b>gdb</b> <b>kvirc</b> <b>exim4</b>

   <b>upgrading</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>system</b>
       To upgrade as many packages as possible:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>full-upgrade</b>

       In  the mode above, Cupt will even consider removing manually installed packages. If you want to restrict
       removing manually installed packages, do

       <b>cupt</b> <b>full-upgrade</b> <b>--no-remove</b>

       Or, shorter:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>safe-upgrade</b>

       There is the third upgrade mode, which is to  be  used  for  upgrades  to  the  next  major  distribution
       releases:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>dist-upgrade</b>

       This  subcommand  upgrades Cupt itself and dpkg at first, and then calls new version of itself to upgrade
       the rest.

   <b>purging</b> <b>packages</b>
       To purge a package, i.e. remove a package along with its configuration files and maybe  some  dynamically
       generated or runtime files:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>remove</b> <b>--purge</b> <u>package_name</u>

       Or:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>purge</b> <u>package_name</u>

       To purge several packages:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>purge</b> <u>package_name_1</u> <u>package_name_2</u> ... <u>package_name_N</u>

       Example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>purge</b> <b>gdb</b>

   <b>Package</b> <b>archives</b> <b>cleaning</b>
       Whenever  Cupt needs to install, upgrade or downgrade packages it downloads binary package archives (<b>.deb</b>
       files) to an archive cache. These archives are not removed after the first usage so they  can  be  reused
       later.

       If  you  do upgrades often, it's a good idea to periodically delete old package archives to save the disk
       space. It's done by the subcommand <b>autoclean</b>:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>autoclean</b>

       The command above  will  delete  all  package  archives  which  do  not  belong  to  currently  available
       repositories.

       If you want to remove all archives from the cache, do

       <b>cupt</b> <b>clean</b>

       Both  subcommands  above  will  also  remove the partially downloaded archive files which may stay around
       after the terminated download operations.

</pre><h4><b>INTERMEDIATE</b> <b>LEVEL</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Working</b> <b>with</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>package</b> <b>versions</b>
   <b>changing</b> <b>repositories</b>
       Cupt uses the same repository list format as APT. See <u><a href="../man5/sources.list.5.html">sources.list</a>(5)</u>.

   <b>release</b> <b>information</b>
       Each version of a certain package has one or more <b>source</b>s where it comes from.

       Each source consists of download information and a subrepository information, or <b>release</b> <b>information</b>.

       The following properties belong to release information:

       basic URI

              a common prefix of URIs for all files which come for this (sub)repository (also referred as <b>origin</b>
              in APT documentation)

              Example: <b><a href="http://ftp.fi.debian.org/debian">http://ftp.fi.debian.org/debian</a></b>

       archive

              a repository archive name, for example <b>testing</b> or <b>stable</b>

       codename

              a release code name, for example <b>wheezy</b> or <b>sid</b>

       component

              a subrepository component name, for example <b>main</b> or <b>non-free</b>

       vendor

              a vendor name, for example: <b>Debian</b>

       label

              a vendor-provided label, for example: <b>Debian-Security</b>

       version

              a release version, for example: <b>6.0</b>

       description

              a repository description line

       Any of properties above may be empty.

       To see available releases:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>policy</b>

       The format of lines above:

       Note that "installed" release have the archive <b>installed</b> and the codename <b>now</b>.

       To see the release descriptions of releases a version belongs to:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>--with-release-info</b> <u>package_name</u>

       Example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>--with-release-info</b> <b>dpkg</b>

   <b>version</b> <b>pinning</b> <b>system</b>
       Each package version has a <b>pin</b>, an integer number.

       Amongst all versions of the same binary package, the one who has maximal  pin  is  <b>policy</b>,  or  <b>preferred</b>
       version.  It's also <b>candidate</b> in APT terminology and in Cupt before 2.3.

       Cupt  assigns  pins to package versions according to the APT documentation (<u><a href="../man5/apt_preferences.5.html">apt_preferences</a>(5)</u>). Plus, it
       adds:

              •  1 to pin of every version which has a signed source

              •  downgrade penalty (the option <b>cupt::cache::pin::addendums::downgrade</b>)

              •  hold penalty for packages that are 'on hold' (the option <b>cupt::cache::pin::addendums::hold</b>)

              •  <b>not</b> <b>automatic</b> penalty for versions which come solely from sources marked as not automatic,  for
                 example,        from       Debian       <b>experimental</b>       distribution       (the       option
                 <b>cupt::cache::pin::addendums::not-automatic</b>)

       Note that sometimes the way APT assigns pins to versions is not the way described in  its  documentation,
       so Cupt's pins (modulo Cupt-specific additions described above) are not necessarily identical to what APT
       produces.

   <b>what</b> <b>package</b> <b>versions</b> <b>are</b> <b>available?</b>
       <b>cupt</b> <b>policy</b> <u>package_name</u>

       Example:

        $ cupt policy dpkg
        dpkg:
          Installed: 1.15.5.6
          Preferred: 1.15.8.10
          Version table:
             1.15.8.10 991
                <a href="http://ftp.fi.debian.org/debian">http://ftp.fi.debian.org/debian</a> testing/main (signed)
                <a href="http://ftp.fi.debian.org/debian">http://ftp.fi.debian.org/debian</a> unstable/main (unsigned)
                <a href="http://ftp.se.debian.org/debian">http://ftp.se.debian.org/debian</a> testing/main (signed)
                <a href="http://ftp.se.debian.org/debian">http://ftp.se.debian.org/debian</a> unstable/main (signed)
         *** 1.15.5.6 100
                <a href="file:/var/lib/dpkg/status">/var/lib/dpkg/status</a> installed/ (unsigned)
             1.14.31 -1499
                <a href="http://security.debian.org">http://security.debian.org</a> oldstable/main (signed)

       In  the  output  above  we can see: installed version ('1.15.5.6'), preferred version ('1.15.8.10') and a
       version table. In total, 3 versions of dpkg are available.

       For each version in version table we can see (on example of '1.15.8.10'): a version pin ('991'),  a  list
       of repositories where this version is available.

       Each repository line is:

       <u>basic_URI</u> <u>archive</u><b>/</b><u>component</u> (<u>signedness</u>)

       The  repository  marked  as  <b>signed</b>  if it has a valid and verified cryptographic signature, and <b>unsigned</b>
       otherwise.

   <b>version</b> <b>string</b> <b>id</b> <b>suffixes</b>
       Starting with version 2.6, Cupt's behavior regarding merging versions  having  the  same  version  string
       changed.

       Firstly, Cupt now never merges installed versions with versions from repositories, since dpkg provides no
       way  to  know if the installed version is the same as the version from repository. All version strings of
       installed versions now have <b>^installed</b> suffix, for example <b>1.2.4^installed</b>.

       Secondly, if same versions from different repositories have different hash sums,  instead  of  discarding
       everything  but  first  version  Cupt  now  append  suffixes  like <b>^dhs0</b> or <b>^dhs315</b> to version strings of
       non-first versions, for example <b>1.2.4^dhs0</b>.

   <b>selecting</b> <b>binary</b> <b>package</b> <b>versions</b>
       When there are more than one version for a package, Cupt provides following ways to select a  version  of
       the binary package in the arguments of the various subcommands:

       policy version

              to select a policy version, just specify a package name alone.

              Example:

              <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>dpkg</b>

       specific version

              to select an exact version of the package, use the suffix <b>=</b><u>version</u>.

              Example:

              <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>dpkg=1.15.8.10</b>

       by archive or codename

              to  select  a  version  in  release  with  known  archive  or codename, use the suffix <b>/</b><u>archive</u> or
              <b>/</b><u>codename</u>.

              Examples:

              <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>dpkg/unstable</b>

              <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>dpkg/sid</b>

       The syntax described above is known as <b>binary</b> <b>package</b> <b>version</b> <b>expression</b>.  In the <u><a href="../man1/cupt.1.html">cupt</a>(1)</u> manual page all
       subcommands which accept this syntax are clearly marked as such.

   <b>Combining</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>version</b> <b>arguments</b>
       Many subcommands accept several arguments of the same meaning. Examples:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>dpkg</b> <b>cupt</b> <b>libpqxx3=3.0.2-1</b>

       <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>youtube-dl</b> <b>clive/stable</b>

       <b>cupt</b> <b>remove</b> <b>libabc-dev</b> <b>libefg-dev</b> <b>libxyz-dev</b>

       <b>cupt</b> <b>policy</b> <b>perl</b> <b>perl-base</b>

       You can use wildcards <b>*</b> and <b>?</b> to select multiple package names. Examples:

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>perl-b*</b>

                 Shows policy versions of packages which names start with  <b>perl-b</b>,  for  example  <b>perl-base</b>  and
                 <b>perl-byacc</b>.

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>perl-*/experimental</b>

                 Shows experimental version of packages which names start with <b>perl-</b> and which have experimental
                 versions.  In  other  words,  packages  without a version in <b>experimental</b> distribution won't be
                 selected.

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>*=2.0.0-1</b> <b>|</b> <b>grep</b> <b>Package</b>

                 List packages which have a version <b>2.0.0-1</b>. Using wildcards with versions is maybe useless, but
                 possible.

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>full-upgrade</b> <b>xserver-xorg-*/installed</b>

                 Perform a full upgrade but keep all installed packages with names starting  with  <b>xserver-xorg-</b>
                 at their current versions.

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>?aff*</b>

                 Show  policy  versions  of  packages with names which have 'a', 'f' and 'f' on 2nd, 3rd and 4th
                 positions (starting with 1st), respectively.

   <b>Conditional</b> <b>installation</b>
       Starting with Cupt 2.4, there is a special subcommand <b>iii</b> ("install if  installed")  for  installing  new
       versions  of already installed packages while not touching uninstalled packages. It behaves like <b>install</b>,
       but ignores arguments corresponding to not installed packages.

       Examples:

              1. You want to upgrade a certain package (say, <b>git</b>) on multiple  machines,  where  some  of  these
                 machines  have that package installed and some not. If you have a mechanism to send one command
                 to all machines (say, ssh multiplexer), you can send the command

                 <b>cupt</b> <b>update</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>cupt</b> <b>iii</b> <b>git</b>

                 The second part of the command will do nothing on the machines where <b>git</b> is not  installed  and
                 will install the preferred version of the package <b>git</b> where this package was installed.

              2. You  have an X server and some X video drivers installed, and you want to upgrade all installed
                 drivers. For that you can do

                 <b>cupt</b> <b>iii</b> <b>xserver-xorg-video*</b>

   <b>Overriding</b> <b>package</b> <b>management</b> <b>actions</b>
   <b>Action</b> <b>override</b> <b>options</b>
       You can use special positional options  <b>--install</b>,  <b>--remove</b>,  <b>--purge</b>,  <b>--iii</b>,  <b>--satisfy</b>,  <b>--unsatisfy</b>,
       <b>--markauto</b>,  <b>--unmarkauto</b>,  <b>--asauto=yes</b>,  <b>--asauto=no</b>, <b>--asauto=default</b> to override the specified action
       until the end of the arguments or the next action override option.

       Examples:

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>remove</b> <b>msmtp-mta</b> <b>--install</b> <b>exim4-daemon-light</b> <b>esmtp</b>

                 Install packages <b>exim4-daemon-light</b> and <b>esmtp</b>, remove the package <b>msmtp-mta</b>.

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>exim4-daemon-light</b> <b>--remove</b> <b>msmtp-mta</b> <b>esmtp</b>

                 Remove the package <b>libass4</b>, purge packages <b>libkate1</b> and <b>libdirac-decoder0</b>.

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>lightspark</b> <b>--remove</b> <b>gnash</b> <b>--satisfy</b> <b>"iceweasel</b> <b>(&gt;=</b> <b>5)"</b>

                 Install the package <b>lightspark</b>, remove the packae <b>gnash</b>, and make sure that <b>iceweasel</b> (at least
                 of version <b>5</b>) is installed.

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>sieve-connect</b> <b>--unsatisfy</b> <b>"iceweasel</b> <b>(&lt;&lt;</b> <b>3.5.20)"</b>

                 Install the package <b>sieve-connect</b>, upgrade or remove the package <b>iceweasel</b> if it  is  installed
                 and has the version lower than <b>3.5.20</b>.

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>libv4l-0</b> <b>cupt</b> <b>--iii</b> <b>libreadline7</b> <b>vlc*</b>

                 Install  packages  <b>libv4l-0</b>  and  <b>cupt</b>,  install  the preferred version of <b>libreadline7</b> if it's
                 installed already, install the preferred versions of packages which names start  with  <b>vlc</b>  and
                 which are installed already .

              •  <b>cupt</b>  <b>remove</b>  <b>youtube-dl</b>  <b>--install</b>  <b>clive</b>  <b>--satisfy</b> <b>"iceweasel</b> <b>(&gt;=</b> <b>4)"</b> <b>--purge</b> <b>cvs</b> <b>subversion</b>

                 Install packages <b>clive</b>  and  <b>git</b>,  remove  the  package  <b>youtube-dl</b>,  purge  packages  <b>cvs</b>  and
                 <b>subversion</b>, make sure that the package <b>iceweasel</b> of version 4 or higher is installed, make sure
                 that the package <b>xinput</b> either is not installed or has the version <b>1.5</b> or higher.

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>vlc</b> <b>--markauto</b> <b>xine</b>

                 Install the package <b>vlc</b> and mark the package <b>xine</b> automatically installed.

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>remove</b> <b>bindfs</b> <b>--unmarkauto</b> <b>fuse</b>

                 You  have  a  package <b>bindfs</b> installed and now don't need it anymore.  <b>cupt</b> <b>remove</b> <b>bindfs</b> shows
                 that the package <b>fuse</b> will be removed as it was a dependency of <b>bindfs</b>; you however decide  you
                 want to keep it in the system and run the command above.

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>mumble</b> <b>libgeoip1</b> <b>geoip-dbg</b>

                 (in  this  and  following  examples  we  suppose  that  currently <b>mumble</b> is manually installed,
                 <b>libgeoip1</b> is automatically installed, <b>geoip-dbg</b> is not installed)

                 <b>geoip-dbg</b> will be manually installed.

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>--asauto=yes</b> <b>mumble</b> <b>libgeoip1</b> <b>geoip-dbg</b>

                 <b>mumble</b> will be marked as automatically installed, <b>geoip-dbg</b> will be automatically installed

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>--asauto=no</b> <b>mumble</b> <b>libgeoip1</b> <b>geoip-dbg</b>

                 <b>libgeoip1</b> will be marked as manually installed, <b>geoip-dbg</b> will be manually installed

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>--asauto=yes</b> <b>mumble</b> <b>--asauto=default</b> <b>libgeoip1</b> <b>geoip-dbg</b>

                 <b>mumble</b> will be marked as automatically installed, <b>geoip-dbg</b> will be manually installed

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>--asauto=no</b> <b>"iptables</b> <b>(&gt;=</b> <b>1.4)"</b>

                 (assuming <b>iptables</b> package not installed) if possible, install enough  recent  (<b>1.4</b>  or  later)
                 version  of  <b>iptables</b>;  <b>iptables</b>  itself  will  be  marked  as manually installed, its possible
                 dependencies as automatically installed

   <b>Package</b> <b>name</b> <b>suffixes</b>
       Alternatively, you can supply some suffixes to package names, that suffixes override the  current  action
       for the suffixed package(s) only:

       +

              "install this"

       -

              "remove this"

       You can use the <b>+</b> modifier in subcommands: <b>remove</b>, <b>purge</b>. Examples:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>remove</b> <b>youtube-dl</b> <b>clive+</b>: remove <b>youtube-dl</b>, install <b>clive</b>

       <b>cupt</b>  <b>purge</b> <b>exim4</b> <b>msmtp-mta+</b> <b>mutt/experimental+</b>: remove <b>exim4</b> along with its configuration files, install
       <b>msmtp-mta</b> and <b>mutt</b> (from experimental)

       You can use the <b>-</b> modifier in the <b>install</b> and <b>*-upgrade</b>-like subcommands. Examples:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>gnuchess/unstable</b> <b>gnome-chess</b>  <b>pychess-</b>:  install  <b>gnuchess</b>  (from  <b>unstable</b>),  <b>gnome-chess</b>,
       remove <b>pychess</b>

       <b>cupt</b> <b>full-upgrade</b> <b>cvs-</b>:

       a) <b>cvs</b> is installed -&gt; do an upgrade with removing <b>cvs</b>

       b) <b>cvs</b> is not installed -&gt; do an upgrade, keeping <b>cvs</b> uninstalled

   <b>Using</b> <b>package</b> <b>archive</b> <b>deltas</b>
       Cupt  has  an  integration  (through  a  special  download  method) with <u><a href="../man1/debdelta.1.html">debdelta</a>(1)</u>. To make Cupt try to
       download archive deltas before downloading full archives, just install the package  <b>debdelta</b>  and  that's
       it. No manual invocation of debdelta utilities is needed.

       See more about debdelta project here: <a href="http://debdelta.debian.net/">http://debdelta.debian.net/</a>.

   <b>Listing</b> <b>dependency</b> <b>information</b>
       To list the dependencies of one or more package versions, use the subcommand <b>depends</b>:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>depends</b> <b>libc6/testing</b> <b>arora/unstable</b>

       If you don't want to see Recommends there, use <b>--important</b>:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>depends</b> <b>--important</b> <b>libc6/testing</b>

       If, on the contrary, you want to see even Suggests, use <b>--with-suggests</b>:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>depends</b> <b>--with-suggests</b> <b>libc6/testing</b>

       You can also list selected relations recursively, using <b>--recurse</b>:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>depends</b> <b>--recurse</b> <b>dpkg</b>

       If you want to see a <b>reverse</b> dependencies of some version, use the subcommand <b>rdepends</b>:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>rdepends</b> <b>xz-utils</b>

       All the command switches described here are also applicable to <b>rdepends</b> as well.

   <b>Action</b> <b>preview</b> <b>prompt</b> <b>(extended)</b>
   <b>summary</b>
       Starting with Cupt 2.3 an action summary is shown by default.

       To  remove  it,  use  <b>--no-summary</b>  command-line  option. To remove it permanently, set the configuration
       option <b>cupt::console::actions-preview::show-summary</b> to <b>no</b>.

       Alternatively, you may want to hide details and view only a summary, this can be achieved  by  specifying
       <b>--summary-only</b>  command-line  option.  This  option  can  be  useful  in  a  conjunction  with <b>--simulate</b>
       command-line option to have a quick preview.

   <b>detailed</b> <b>solution</b> <b>preview</b>
       You can request more information to show in the action preview prompt:

              •  package versions

                 Use <b>--show-versions</b> (<b>-V</b>) option. Example:

                  $ cupt install gcc-4.6 -V

                  The following packages will be installed:

              •  by-package disk usage changes

                 Use <b>--show-size-changes</b> (<b>-Z</b>) option. Example:

                  $ cupt install gcc-4.6 -Z

                  The following packages will be installed:

              •  release archives

                 Use <b>--show-archives</b> (<b>-A</b>) option. Example:

                  $ cupt install gcc-4.7 -A

                  The following packages will be installed:

                  cpp-4.7 [(experimental)]
                  gcc-4.7 [(experimental)]

              •  release components

                 Use <b>--show-components</b> (<b>-C</b>) option. It's mostly useful in conjunction with  <b>--show-codenames</b>  or
                 <b>--show-archives</b>. Example:

                  $ cupt install libstreams0 -CN

                  The following packages will be upgraded:

                  libstreamanalyzer0 [(now,squeeze/main) -&gt; (wheezy/main,sid/main)]
                  libstreams0 [(now,squeeze/main) -&gt; (wheezy/main,sid/main)]

              •  release vendors

                 Use  <b>--show-vendors</b>  (<b>-O</b>)  option.  Useful if you have repositories of more than one vendor and
                 usually in conjunction with <b>-V</b>, <b>-A</b> or <b>-N</b>. Example:

                  $ cupt install libstreams0 -VNO

                  The following packages will be upgraded:

                  libstreamanalyzer0 [0.7.2-1+b1(dpkg:now,Debian:squeeze) -&gt; 0.7.7-1(Debian:wheezy,Debian:sid)]

              •  change reasons

                 To show, why resolver did the change(s), use <b>--show-reasons</b> (<b>-D</b>) option.  Example:

                  $ cupt install gcc-4.6 -D

                  The following packages will be installed:

                  cpp-4.6
                    reason: gcc-4.6 4.6.0~rc1-1 depends on 'cpp-4.6 (= 4.6.0~rc1-1)'

              •  show not preferred versions

                 To show packages which will have a not preferred version  (which  usually  means  not  (enough)
                 upgraded), use <b>--show-not-preferred</b> option.

                 This is enabled for upgrades by default.

                 For non-upgrade example, the next command may be used to determine the installed packages which
                 have a better candidate (again, usually that means they can be upgraded):

                  $ cupt install --no-auto-remove --show-not-preferred -V

                  The following packages will have a not preferred version:

       The effect above is the same as if you specified


       <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>gnash</b> <b>libgnome-keyring0-</b>
       in the command line from the start.

       Starting from Cupt 2.6 you can specify multiple expressions on the same line.

   <b>colors</b>
       Some parts of the  actions  preview  will  be  colored  if  you  enable  colors  by  setting  the  option
       <b>cupt::console::use-colors</b> to <b>auto</b> or <b>yes</b> (see <u><a href="../man5/cupt.conf.5.html">cupt.conf</a>(5)</u>).

       In the colored output different colors specify different actions types.  Manually installed package names
       and potentially unsafe actions have bold colors.

       Starting from Cupt 2.10, colors are enabled on terminals by default (<b>auto</b> setting).

   <b>Adjusting</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>variables</b>
   <b>intro</b>
       There  are two types of configuration variables - <b>regular</b> (or <b>scalar</b>) and <b>list</b> ones.  Scalar options have
       a single scalar value, and list option's value is a list of strings.  Modifying  a  scalar  option  means
       substituting  its  previous value completely in favor of new specified one, modifying a list option means
       adding one more string to the existing list.

       Cupt has many configuration variables, some  of  them  may  be  specified/overridden  using  command-line
       switches,  some  needs  to  be  modified  explicitly.  See  the  full  variable  list and descriptions at
       <u><a href="../man5/cupt.conf.5.html">cupt.conf</a>(5)</u>.

       To see the current configuration, use <b>config-dump</b> subcommand. Examples:

        $ cupt config-dump | grep recommends
        apt::install-recommends "yes";
        cupt::resolver::keep-recommends "yes";
        cupt::resolver::tune-score::failed-recommends "600";

        $ cupt config-dump | grep "methods "
        cupt::downloader::protocols::copy::methods { "file"; };
        cupt::downloader::protocols::debdelta::methods { "debdelta"; };
        cupt::downloader::protocols::file::methods { "file"; };
        cupt::downloader::protocols::ftp::methods { "curl"; };
        cupt::downloader::protocols::ftp::methods { "wget"; };
        cupt::downloader::protocols::http::methods { "curl"; };
        cupt::downloader::protocols::http::methods { "wget"; };
        cupt::downloader::protocols::https::methods { "curl"; };
        cupt::downloader::protocols::https::methods { "wget"; };

       You can distinguish list options there by figure brackets around the values.

   <b>configuration</b> <b>sources</b>
       Cupt reads configuration in the following order:

              1. from Cupt preconfiguration file (see <u><a href="../man5/cupt.conf.5.html">cupt.conf</a>(5)/cupt::directory::configuration::pre</u>)

              2. from APT configuration files (conforming to the APT documentation (<u><a href="../man5/apt.conf.5.html">apt.conf</a>(5)</u>))

              3. from Cupt-specific configuration files (see <u><a href="../man5/cupt.conf.5.html">cupt.conf</a>(5)/cupt::directory::configuration</u>)

              4. from the command line (<b>--option</b> (or  <b>-o</b>)  switches  and  dedicated  switches  corresponding  to
                 specific options)

   <b>setting</b> <b>options</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b>
       To modify a regular option in the command line, use

       <b>-o</b> <u>option_name</u><b>=</b><u>new_value</u>

       Example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>kmail</b> <b>-o</b> <b>cupt::console::assume-yes=yes</b>

       To modify a list option (i.e. add a new string) in the command line, use

       <b>-o</b> <u>option_name</u><b>::=</b><u>added_string</u>

       Example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>-s</b> <b>update</b> <b>-o</b> <b>"apt::update::pre-invoke::=ls</b> <b><a href="file:/var">/var</a>"</b>

       You can use <b>-o</b> multiple times.

   <b>Automatically</b> <b>installed</b> <b>packages</b>
   <b>view</b>
       If you want to know, is a certain package automatically installed or not, do

       <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>--installed-only</b> <u>package_name</u>

       Example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>--installed-only</b> <b>dpkg</b>

       To list manually installed packages:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>showauto</b> <b>--invert</b>

       To list automatically installed packages:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>showauto</b>

   <b>change</b>
       To mark some package(s) as automatically installed, use the <b>markauto</b> subcommand, for example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>markauto</b> <b>libqtcore4</b> <b>udev</b>

       To mark some package(s) as manually installed, use the <b>unmarkauto</b> subcommand, for example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>unmarkauto</b> <b>tar</b> <b>traceroute</b>

   <b>removal</b>
       When  doing  installs/upgrades/etc.  all  newly  installed  packages  not requested by user are marked as
       automatically installed. For every package management actions  Cupt's  resolver  can  determine  if  some
       automatically  installed  packages are not needed anymore. Automatically installed packages, which are no
       more a part of any valuable dependency chain of manually installed packages, are deleted by default.  The
       names of this process is <b>auto-removal</b>.

       If  you  don't  want  auto-removal  to  be  performed,  use  <b>--no-auto-remove</b>  switch  or  set the option
       <b>cupt::resolver::auto-remove</b> to <b>no</b>.

   <b>Soft</b> <b>dependencies</b>
       All forward interdependencies between packages can be divided into two groups  --  <b>hard</b>  and  <b>soft</b>  ones.
       While  hard  dependencies  must be satisfied in order to make a system (or proposed solution) valid, soft
       ones may stay unsatisfied.   Hard  dependencies  are  'Pre-Depends',  'Depends'.  Soft  dependencies  are
       'Recommends',  'Suggests' and 'Enhances'. Cupt completely ignores 'Enhances', but can act on 'Recommends'
       or 'Suggests'. All the remainder of this section is dedicated to the last two.

       By default, Cupt ignores 'Suggests', but tries to, with an average priority, satisfy new dependencies  in
       'Recommends' and keep already satisfied 'Recommends'.

       You can use the following options to change the behavior:

       apt::install-recommends

              set   this   to   <b>no</b>   to   not  satisfy  new  'Recommends'.  See  also  the  command-line  switch
              <b>--no-install-recommends</b>.

       cupt::resolver::keep-recommends

              set this to <b>no</b> to make resolver ignore all 'Recommends'

       apt::install-suggests

              set this <b>yes</b> to make resolver try to satisfy new 'Suggests'

       cupt::resolver::keep-suggests

              set this to <b>yes</b> to make resolver try to keep already satisfied 'Suggests'

       Note 1: having the option <b>apt::install-</b><u>X</u> set to <b>yes</b> without <b>cupt::resolver::keep-</b><u>X</u> set to <b>yes</b> as well  is
       useless, Cupt's native resolver will warn about it.

       Note  2:  even  when  the  appropriate  <b>apt::install-</b><u>X</u>  option  is  set,  Cupt  ignores  not changed soft
       dependencies.  Say, if there is an installed package <b>gettext</b> of version  <b>1.2</b>  which  <b>Recommends:</b>  <b>cvs</b>,  a
       relation <b>cvs</b> is not satisfied in the system, and <b>gettext</b> is upgraded to a version <b>1.3</b> which also have the
       same <b>Recommends:</b> <b>cvs</b>, Cupt won't try to satisfy this dependency.

   <b>Understanding</b> <b>package</b> <b>installation</b> <b>process</b>
       After you agree with a proposed solution (by entering a positive answer in an action preview prompt) Cupt
       starts a package installation process, which is done in several phases:

              1. preparation

                 In  this  phase  Cupt  computes the order in which <u><a href="../man1/dpkg.1.html">dpkg</a>(1)</u> will called and the options to pass.
                 This phase may take a while for large changes.

              2. downloading

                 In this phase Cupt downloads needed binary packages (<b>*.deb</b>). May be empty if  no  packages  are
                 needed or all needed packages are already in the cache.

              3. pre-hooks

                 In    this    phase   Cupt   calls   registered   pre-hooks   (options   <b>dpkg::pre-invoke</b>   and
                 <b>dpkg::pre-install-pkgs</b>) if any. Examples of them are  <u><a href="../man1/apt-listchanges.1.html">apt-listchanges</a>(1)</u>,  <u><a href="../man1/apt-listbugs.1.html">apt-listbugs</a>(1)</u>  and
                 <u><a href="../man1/dpkg-preconfigure.1.html">dpkg-preconfigure</a>(1)</u>.   These hooks may ask questions and cancel the whole package installation
                 process.

              4. action themselves

                 In this phase Cupt calls dpkg as many times as needed to perform requested actions.

              5. post-hooks

                 In this phase Cupt calls registered post-hooks (the option <b>dpkg::post-invoke</b>) if any.

       Note: Cupt itself does not ask anything from the  user  during  the  package  installation  process.  All
       questions usually come from programs which Cupt calls.

       Example:

        1: # cupt install cmake

       This is a command line.

        2: Building the package cache...
        3: Initializing package resolver and worker...
        4: Scheduling requested actions...
        5: Resolving possible unmet dependencies...

       These are (optional) information messages from Cupt.

       This is the 'action themselves' phase, dpkg's output and messages from packages' maintainer scripts.

       In  the  case  the  process  fails  at  phase  'action  themselves'  (either due to bug in Cupt, dpkg, or
       packages), you'll see some error messages from dpkg and then error messages from Cupt.

   <b>Source</b> <b>packages</b>
   <b>overview</b>
       Source packages are the files from which binary packages are built. They have two major differences:

              •  Source packages cannot be "installed" to the system like binary packages.

              •  Unlike binary packages, source package consists of 3 or more files, not a single one:

                 •  tarball(s)

                    one or more compressed <u><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a>(1)</u> archives containing an upstream code

                 •  diff

                    a file containing Debian changes, may be missing in the <b>native</b> (Debian-specific) packages

                 •  dsc

                    a text file with some headers

   <b>exploring</b>
       To view a source package information:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>showsrc</b> <u>package_name</u>

       Example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>showsrc</b> <b>cupt</b>

       You can specify more than one package, for example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>showsrc</b> <b>sed</b> <b>mawk</b>

       To view available source versions, pin info and releases versions come from,  use  <b>policysrc</b>  subcommand.
       Its output is the same as for policy subcommand. Example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>policysrc</b> <b>sed</b> <b>mawk</b>

       To download source package(s), use the <b>source</b> subcommand, for example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>source</b> <b>clive</b> <b>youtube-dl</b>

       By  default  <b>source</b>  subcommand  also unpack the package so it's ready for the exploring and building. To
       prevent this, use the <b>--download-only</b> switch.  Also, you can download only one part  of  source  package,
       use switches <b>--tar-only</b>, <b>--diff-only</b> and <b>--dsc-only</b> for that.

   <b>satisfying</b> <b>build</b> <b>dependencies</b>
       If you want to build binary packages out of a source one, you will have to satisfy source package's build
       dependencies before. Use the subcommand <b>build-dep</b> to do it, for example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>build-dep</b> <b>clive</b>

       All  new packages, installed by this subcommand, will be marked as automatically installed, and will be a
       subject for auto-removal (#auto-removal) at next package management action.

       So, the process of building binary packages out of source one may be, taking <b>clive</b> package as an example:

        cupt source clive
        cupt build-dep clive
        cd clive-2.2.13 &amp;&amp; debuild &amp;&amp; cd ../
        [...]
        cupt install

       The last line will remove all unneeded anymore packages (given  auto-removal  is  turned  on),  including
       those installed by <b>build-dep</b>.

   <b>selecting</b> <b>source</b> <b>package</b> <b>versions</b>
       You can select source package versions in two ways:

              1. Provide  a  <b>source</b> <b>package</b> <b>version</b> <b>expression</b>. It has the same syntax as binary package version
                 expression, but instead of specifying a binary package name you specify a source package name.

                 Example:

                 <b>cupt</b> <b>showsrc</b> <b>game-music-emu=0.5.5-2</b> <b>gcc-defaults/experimental</b>

              2. Provide a binary package version expression, which  will  be  converted  to  a  source  package
                 version expression when possible.

                 Example:

                  $ cupt show g++/experimental | head -n5
                  Package: g++
                  Version: 4:4.6.0-2exp1
                  Status: not installed
                  Source: gcc-defaults
                  Source version: 1.101exp1
                  $ cupt showsrc g++/experimental | head -n3
                  Package: gcc-defaults
                  Binary: cpp, g++, g++-multilib, gobjc, gobjc-multilib, gobjc++,
                  gobjc++-multilib, gfortran, gfortran-multilib, gccgo, gccgo-multilib,
                  libgcj-common, gcj, gij, libgcj-bc, gcj-jdk, gcj-jre-headless, gcj-jre, gcc,
                  gcc-multilib, gdc, gcc-spu, g++-spu, gfortran-spu
                  Version: 1.101exp1

                 Here,  <b>g++</b>  is  a  binary package name and <b>gcc-defaults</b> is a source package name. In the second
                 command, as there is no source  package  <b>g++</b>,  a  binary  package  was  looked  up,  a  version
                 <b>4:4.6.0-2exp1</b> of it was found, and then a source version was selected as if you specified

                 <b>cupt</b> <b>showsrc</b> <b>gcc-defaults=1.101exp1</b>

                 in the first place.

       You can supply both syntaxes to all subcommands which work with source package versions, examples:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>build-dep</b> <b>clive/unstable</b>

       <b>cupt</b> <b>source</b> <b>man-db=2.5.9-4</b>

   <b>Package</b> <b>manager</b> <b>shell</b>
       Cupt  has  a  shell-like environment, in which you can supply any subcommand as if you typed it in to the
       command line, but without preceding cupt command name.

       Example:

        $ cupt shell
        This is interactive shell of cupt package manager.

        Description: daemon for the Soprano RDF framework
         Soprano is a pluggable RDF storage, parsing, and serialization framework based
         on Qt 4. Soprano is targeted at desktop applications that need to store RDF
         data. Its API has been optimized for simplicity and ease of use, while its
         modular structure allows it to use various different RDF storage
         implementations as its backend.
         .
         This package contains the Soprano daemon, D-Bus service, parser
         plugins, and a storage plugin for the Redland RDF Application Framework.

       What this mode may be useful for:

              •  fast queries

                 When entering shell mode, the configuration is read and cache is built. Until  some  management
                 subcommand  is executed, query subcommands don't have to re-read the configuration and cache on
                 each invocation, and most of them execute instantly in shell mode.

              •  common configuration changes

                 As the <b>shell</b> subcommand, as all others, recognizes <u><a href="../man1/cupt.1.html">cupt</a>(1)/Common</u> <u>options</u>, you can use that  to
                 set some configuration options for all the shell session.

                 Example:

                 <b>cupt</b> <b>shell</b> <b>--simulate</b> <b>-o</b> <b>apt::install-recommends=no</b>

                 Installing  new  recommends  will  be switched off for all the session inside the shell, and no
                 real actions will be performed for subcommands that  change  the  system.  Note  that  you  can
                 override  them  (by  supplying <b>-o</b> <b>cupt::worker::simulate=no</b> and <b>-o</b> <b>apt::install-recommends=yes</b>,
                 respectively, for this example).

   <b>Limiting</b> <b>used</b> <b>repositories</b>
       As of Cupt version 2.3, you can limit the used package repositories for each package  manager  invocation
       without editing the <u><a href="../man5/sources.list.5.html">sources.list</a>(5)</u>. The limiting can be done by repository archive names or codenames.

       The common syntax is:

       <u>limiting_option</u><b>=</b><u>value</u><b>,</b><u>value</u><b>,</b>...<b>,</b><u>value</u>

       Use  the  option  <b>--include-archives</b>  or <b>--include-codenames</b> to use only specified repositories. In other
       words, no matter how many repositories are present in the <u><a href="../man5/sources.list.5.html">sources.list</a>(5)</u>, only packages  from  specified
       repositories will be considered.

       Examples:

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>rdepends</b> <b>--include-archives=testing,unstable</b> <b>libffi5</b>

                 List reverse-dependencies of <b>libffi5</b> package in <b>testing</b> and <b>unstable</b>.

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>safe-upgrade</b> <b>--include-archives=stable,stable-updates</b>

                 Upgrade the system, considering only packages from archives <b>stable</b> and <b>stable-updates</b>.

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>xserver-xorg</b> <b>--include-codenames=wheezy</b>

                 Install  the package <b>xserver-xorg</b>, if its version in the <b>wheezy</b> is different than installed one
                 or there is no such package installed. If any packages need to be changed in order  to  process
                 this  query (e.g., installing new dependencies or removing conflicting packages), only versions
                 from <b>wheezy</b> will be considered.

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>search</b> <b>--names-only</b> <b>'.*?-perl'</b> <b>--include-archives=experimental</b>

                 Search for Perl module packages in <b>experimental</b>.

       Use the option <b>--exclude-archives</b> or <b>--exclude-codenames</b> to not use specified repositories.  If a package
       version has multiple repositories and at least one of them is not excluded, the version will be visible.

       Examples:

              •  <b>search</b> <b>-n</b> <b>cupt</b> <b>--exclude-archives=stable</b>

                 Search for Cupt-related packages, but ignore packages from <b>stable</b>.

              •  <b>cupt</b> <b>full-upgrade</b> <b>--exclude-codenames=sid,experimental</b>

                 Upgrade not using packages which come only from <b>sid</b> or <b>experimental</b>.

       Limiting repositories can  also  be  done  by  modifying  the  <b>cupt::cache::limit-releases::*</b>  family  of
       configuration variables directly.

       Note:  unlike  the  pinning  settings  which  only  set  version  priorities, limiting repositories is an
       "absolute" tool. For example, if the version has a very negative pin, it will  be  still  considered  for
       installation if there is no better choices, but if all repositories which contain a version are not used,
       Cupt will forgot about that version from a very start and forever, without exceptions.

   <b>Logging</b>
       As  of  Cupt  version  2.2,  most  actions that effectively change the state of the system or Cupt itself
       (namely, working with packages, updating repository metadata  and  working  with  system  snapshots)  are
       logged by default.

       The  place  (the  file path) where to place the logs is determined by the option <b>cupt::directory::log</b>. By
       default, logs are written to <b>/var/log/cupt.log</b>.

       There are 4 levels of logging:

       0      absolutely no logging at all

       1      very minimal logging

       2      the significant information is logged

       3      very detailed logging

       Logging levels are set for each subsystem independently.  By  default,  the  logging  level  for  package
       changes  is  set to <b>2</b>, other logging levels are set to <b>1</b>. To change the logging level for some subsystem,
       use the option <b>cupt::worker::log::levels::</b><u>subsystem</u>.  See <u><a href="../man5/cupt.conf.5.html">cupt.conf</a>(5)</u> for details.

       Finally, if you want to disable the logging entirely, set the option <b>cupt::worker::log</b> to <b>no</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ADVANCED</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Functional</b> <b>selectors</b>
       <b>Functional</b> <b>selectors</b> is a extended syntax for selecting binary or source versions by their properties  or
       relations. It's available starting with Cupt 2.6.

       It  can  be used whereever binary package version expression and source package version expression can be
       used. It addition, it can be used as a parameter to <b>search</b> <b>--fse</b>.

       The full syntax and function reference can be found in <u><a href="../man7/cupt_functionalselectors.7.html">cupt_functionalselectors</a>(7)</u>.

       Examples of functional selector expressions (FSE):

              •  <b>essential()</b>

                 All essential versions (those which have <b>Essential:</b> <b>yes</b>).

                 In the command line it will be

                 <b>cupt</b> <b>show</b> <b>'essential()'</b>

                 or

                 <b>cupt</b> <b>search</b> <b>--fse</b> <b>'essential()'</b>

              •  <b>e()</b>

                 The same. <b>e</b> is a shortcut for <b>essential</b>.

              •  <b>package:name(.*req.*)</b>

                 All versions which package name contains the substring <b>req</b>.

              •  <b>Pn(.*req.*)</b>

                 Same. <b>Pn</b> is a shortcut for <b>package:name</b>.

              •  <b>and(Pn(b.*),</b> <b>e())</b>

                 All versions which are essential and which package name starts with a letter <b>b</b>.

              •  <b>and(Pn(b.*),</b> <b>e)</b>

                 Same. In subexpressions <b>()</b> can be omitted for functions with no parameters.

              •  <b>Pn(b.*)</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>e()</b>

                 Same. <b>x</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>y</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>z</b> is a special shortcut syntax for <b>and(x,</b> <b>y,</b> <b>z)</b>.

              •  <b>or(e,</b> <b>provides(vim))</b>

                 Versions which are essential or provide <b>vim</b> virtual package.

              •  <b>e()</b> <b>|</b> <b>provides(vim)</b>

                 Same. <b>x</b> <b>|</b> <b>y</b> <b>|</b> <b>z</b> is a special shortcut syntax for <b>or(x,</b> <b>y,</b> <b>z)</b>.

              •  <b>xor(Pn(vim.*),</b> <b>provides(vim))</b>

                 Versions, which either have a package name  which  starts  with  <b>vim</b>  or  provide  <b>vim</b>  virtual
                 package, but not both.

              •  <b>not(Pn(vim-nox))</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>provides(vim)</b>

                 Versions which provide <b>vim</b> virtual package, excluding the package <b>vim-nox</b>.

              •  <b>installed()</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>priority(extra)</b>

                 Installed versions of priority <b>extra</b>.

              •  <b>maintainer(.*lists.alioth.debian.org.*)</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>priority(required)</b>

                 Versions  of  priority  <b>required</b> and which maintainer email address is a mailing list hosted on
                 the Alioth service.

              •  <b>field(Python-Version,</b> <b>.*2\.3.*)</b>

                 Versions which have a non-standard field <b>Python-Version</b> with a substring <b>2.3</b> somewhere  in  the
                 value.

              •  <b>Pn(.*python.*)</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>section(utils)</b>

                 package.

                 For complex FSEs like this it, the multiline no-shortcut equivalent might be preferred:

                 cupt search --fse '
                      recursive(_r,

                           )
                      )'

   <b>System</b> <b>snapshots</b>
       System snapshots, created by Cupt, consist of binary archives of installed packages.   The  idea  is  you
       create  snapshots  at  some time, and when after some changes you system is messed up, you can go back to
       the working set of packages.

       Caveats:

              •  The most usual use case for it is downgrade the packages  after  a  bad  upgrade,  but  package
                 downgrades are usually not supported, so it have not a guarantee to work.

              •  As of now, snapshots does not store an information about automatically installed packages.

              •  If  the  system  doesn't  boot  or  messed  up to the level that Cupt or dpkg are unable to run
                 properly, you cannot revert the system.

       It's recommended not to use this feature if you have better  alternatives  available  (for  example,  LVM
       snapshots or filesystem-level snapshots).

       To create a snapshot, use

       <b>cupt</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>save</b> <u>snapshot_name</u>

       Example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>save</b> <b>20110405</b>

       To revert the system to a saved snapshot, use

       <b>cupt</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>load</b> <u>snapshot_name</u>

       Example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>load</b> <b>20110405</b>

       You  can  also  list  the available snapshots (<b>cupt</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>list</b>), rename (<b>cupt</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>rename</b>), remove
       (<b>cupt</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>remove</b>).

   <b>Satisfying</b> <b>particular</b> <b>dependency</b> <b>relation</b> <b>expressions</b>
       There is an ability to change the system not by specifying versions of packages to install or remove, but
       by specifying dependencies just as some binary package have them.  The  subcommand  to  perform  this  is
       <b>satisfy</b>:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>satisfy</b> <u>dependency_expression_1</u> ... <u>dependency_expression_N</u>

       Examples:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>"xserver-xorg</b> <b>(&gt;&gt;</b> <b>1.6)"</b> <b>"xserver-common</b> <b>(&lt;&lt;</b> <b>1.6.1~)"</b>

       <b>cupt</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>"nautilus</b> <b>(&gt;=</b> <b>2.16.0),</b> <b>libnautilus-extension1</b> <b>(&gt;=</b> <b>2.16.0),</b> <b>wget</b> <b>(&gt;=</b> <b>1.10.0)"</b>

       <b>cupt</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>"youtube-dl</b> <b>|</b> <b>clive"</b>

       If  you  want  some  dependency  expression  to  be  unsatisfied  instead, add minus (<b>-</b>) to the end of an
       argument:


       <b>cupt</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>mail-reader-</b>
       Be careful:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>vim</b> <b>emacs-</b>: install vim or anything which provides  it,  remove  emacs  and  anything  which
       provides it

       <b>cupt</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>"vim,</b> <b>emacs-"</b>: remove emacs, vim and anything which provides them

   <b>Request</b> <b>type</b> <b>options</b>
       By  default,  when you type <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>abcde</b>, the preferred version of <b>abcde</b> package will be installed.
       By default, on <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>abcde/unstable</b> the best of <b>abcde</b> versions found in <b>unstable</b> distribution will
       be installed. Also, by default, <b>cupt</b> <b>remove</b> <b>wget/installed</b> or <b>cupt</b> <b>remove</b>  <b>wget/wheezy</b>  will  remove  all
       versions of <b>wget</b> package (so none of them may be installed). This is <b>traditional</b> selection behavior.

       Starting  with  Cupt  2.6,  it's possible to choose (per request) new <b>flexible</b> selection behavior, though
       traditional  selection  behavior  is  still  the   default.    Flexible   behavior   is   enabled   using
       <b>--select=flexible</b>  (or, shorter, <b>--sf</b>) command line option. Traditional behavior can be (re)enabled using
       <b>--select=traditional</b> (or, shorter, <b>--st</b>) command line option.

       Flexible selection behavior is often more intuitive.  <b>cupt</b> <b>--sf</b> <b>install</b> <b>abcde</b> will install any version of
       <b>abcde</b> package (with, as usual, resolver choosing versions with higher pins  first).   <b>cupt</b>  <b>--sf</b>  <b>install</b>
       <b>abcde/unstable</b>  will  install  any version of <b>abcde</b> found in <b>unstable</b> distribution. <b>cupt</b> <b>--sf</b> <b>remove</b> <b>wget</b>
       will still remove the package unconditionally just like traditional behavior, but, say, <b>cupt</b> <b>--sf</b>  <b>remove</b>
       <b>wget/installed</b>  <b>wget/wheezy</b>  may  either  remove <b>wget</b> package or install some its version not from <b>wheezy</b>
       distribution.

       The command line options above  are  positional  and  can  be  mixed.   <b>cupt</b>  <b>--select=flexible</b>  <b>iii</b>  <b>jhc</b>
       <b>ncdu/experimental</b>  <b>--select=traditional</b> <b>--remove</b> <b>automake*/installed</b> will install (if were installed) any
       version of <b>jhc</b> and any version of <b>ncdu</b> found in <b>experimental</b>  distribution,  but  unconditionally  remove
       installed packages which names start with <b>automake</b>.

   <b>Request</b> <b>importance</b> <b>options</b>
       By  default,  when  you  ask  Cupt  to  perform  some  package management actions, they will be performed
       unconditionally. As in, the command will fail if any of requested actions cannot be performed.  Sometimes
       more flexibility might be wanted, especially with wildcards and FSE.

       Starting  with Cupt 2.6, it's possibly to specify also non-mandatory, or optional, requests. For optional
       requests you also specify their importance, choosing  from  a  three  predefined  profiles  or  supplying
       precise integer value.  The request importance is controlled by <b>--importance=</b> command line option.

       To  specify actions which should be tried hard but you accept that some of them could not be satisfied at
       reasonable price (e.g. some of them conflicts with each other or require extremely "bad" changes  to  the
       system), use <b>--importance=try</b> (or its shortcut <b>--try</b>). For example:

        $ cupt -s install --try 'provides(vim)' --no-summary

        The following packages will be installed:

        [...] vim-athena vim-nox

        The following packages will be upgraded:

        [...] vim vim-common vim-gtk vim-gui-common vim-runtime

        [...]

        Leave the following dependencies unresolved:

        user request: install provides(vim) | for package 'vim-gnome'

       To  specify actions with low importance (as in: "do some of them if possible"), use <b>--importance=wish</b> (or
       its shortcut <b>--wish</b>). For example:

        $ cupt -s --wish remove *gnome*

        [...]

        The following packages will be removed:

        gnome-keyring gstreamer0.10-plugins-good libpam-gnome-keyring
        libsoup-gnome2.4-1

        The following packages are no longer needed and thus will be auto-removed:

        gcr gstreamer0.10-gconf gstreamer0.10-x iptables libcap-ng0 libcap2-bin
        libdrm-nouveau1a libdv4 libgck-1-0 libgcr-3-1 libgcr-3-common libiec61883-0
        libnfnetlink0 libpam-cap libxtables10

        Leave the following dependencies unresolved:

        gksu 2.0.2-6^installed recommends 'gnome-keyring'
        user request: remove *gnome* | for package 'libgnome-keyring-common'
        user request: remove *gnome* | for package 'libgnome-keyring0'
        libwebkitgtk-3.0-0 2.0.4-5 recommends 'gstreamer1.0-plugins-good'
        libwebkitgtk-1.0-0 2.0.4-5 recommends 'gstreamer1.0-plugins-good'

       To specify precise numeric importance(s), use <b>--importance=</b><u>number</u>. For example:

        $ cupt -s install --importance=10000 xmail --importance=15000 nullmailer --no-auto-remove

        The following packages will be installed:

        nullmailer

        The following packages will be removed:

        msmtp-mta

        Leave the following dependencies unresolved:

        user request: install xmail | for package 'xmail'

        $ cupt -s install --importance=20000 xmail --importance=15000 nullmailer --no-auto-remove

        The following packages will be installed:

        xmail

        The following packages will be removed:

        msmtp-mta

        Leave the following dependencies unresolved:

        user request: install nullmailer | for package 'nullmailer'

       You can also, as usually, mix those options and use <b>--importance=must</b> (or its shortcut <b>--must</b>) to restore
       default behavior, for example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>--try</b> <b>pinentry-*</b> <b>--wish</b> <b>*debootstrap</b> <b>--must</b> <b>--select=flexible</b> <b>icedove</b> <b>*xulrunner*</b>

       The penalty values of <b>--importance=try</b> and <b>--importance=wish</b>  are  controlled  by  configuration  options
       <b>cupt::resolver::score::unsatisfied-try</b> and <b>cupt::resolver::score::unsatisfied-wish</b>, respectively.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>disk</b> <b>space</b>
       If  you  happen  to  have  a  system,  where  the  disk  space  is  very limited, doing a big upgrades or
       installations can be a problem. For example, you have 1 GiB  of  disk  space  total,  installed  packages
       occupy  600  MiB  of  them,  now you want to do a massive upgrade, and it's needed to download 500 MiB of
       archives to do that, and after the upgrade packages will occupy 700 MiB. Here,  the  simple  approach  of
       download everything needed and then upgrade everything needed wouldn't work since there is no 1100 MiB of
       the  disk space available. The answer is to do the upgrade by smaller parts. Now, although it can be done
       by selecting groups of packages to upgrade or install by hand, Cupt can try to do it automatically.

       To enable the <b>changeset-based</b> <b>mode</b> you will be need specify how many space is  available  for  downloaded
       files.  It's  impossible  to  compute  the amount reliably since changed packages may use some additional
       space (for example, kernel upgrades) or you may write or remove something to the filesystem  before/while
       the upgrading is progressing. A rough guess of 'amount of free space minus 100 MiB' is a good start.

       After you computed the disk space you can give for package archives, specify it as a value, in bytes, for
       <b>cupt::worker::archives-space-limit</b> option.  Example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>full-upgrade</b> <b>-o</b> <b>cupt::worker::archives-space-limit=200000000</b>

       Once  this option is set, an action scheduler will try to divide all the changes into smaller consecutive
       changesets so the following conditions are met:

              •  Download amounts for package changes in any changeset won't exceed the declared limit.

              •  After each changeset is done, system is fully working  in  the  sense  of  packages,  i.e.  all
                 dependencies are met and there are no packages in interim states.

       If  such changesets are found, Cupt will proceed with actions, otherwise an error with a minimal suitable
       number will be printed.

       For each changeset, package archives will be downloaded before doing actions and removed before the  next
       changeset begins.

   <b>Synchronization</b> <b>by</b> <b>source</b> <b>versions</b>
       Sometimes it is a good idea to keep installed binary packages which were built out of same source package
       (let's call them <b>related</b>) to have the same source version.

       Related  packages  are <b>synchronized</b> if they have the same source version, i.e.  binary version may not be
       the same. For example, the following pairs are usually synchronized:

              •  <b>qprint</b> <b>1.0-1</b> and <b>qprint-doc</b> <b>1.0-1</b>

              •  <b>qprint</b> <b>1.0-1+b2</b> and <b>qprint-doc</b> <b>1.0-1</b>

       But the following are usually not:

              •  <b>qprint</b> <b>1.0-1</b> and <b>qprint-doc</b> <b>1.0-2</b>

       Cupt's  resolver  tries  to  synchronize  the  versions  of  related  binary  packages  if   the   option
       <b>cupt::resolver::synchronize-by-source-versions</b> is set to non-default value.

       Note:  this option works properly only if you have source packages available for all the packages touched
       by a resolver.

       Note: this option doesn't touch installed packages.

       Example:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>safe-upgrade</b> <b>-o</b> <b>cupt::resolver::synchronize-by-source-versions=hard</b>

       The <b>hard</b> value means that all changed packages must be synchronized, e.g.  consider  the  synchronization
       an additional hard dependency.  The <b>soft</b> value means that all unsynchronized changed packages will have a
       penalty of <b>cupt::resolver::score::failed-synchronization</b>, e.g. consider the synchronization as additional
       soft dependency.

       Example:

       Suppose  we have <b>libfoo1</b> and <b>foo</b> binary packages which came from the same source package. We have <b>libfoo1</b>
       <b>1.2-1</b> and <b>foo</b> <b>1.2-1</b> installed.

       Situation 1: <b>libfoo1</b> has new <b>1.3-1</b> version and foo has new <b>1.3-1</b> version.

       Situation 2: <b>libfoo1</b> has new <b>1.3-1</b> version and foo has new <b>1.3-2</b> version.

       We do:

       <b>cupt</b> <b>install</b> <b>foo</b>

       What would be done by resolver if we have:

              •  no synchronization

                 Situation 1: install new <b>foo</b>, leave <b>libfoo1</b> as of installed version

                 Situation 2: install new <b>foo</b>, leave <b>libfoo1</b> as of installed version

              •  soft synchronization

                 Situation 1: install new <b>foo</b> and <b>libfoo1</b>

                 Situation 2: install new <b>foo</b>, leave <b>libfoo1</b> as of installed version

              •  hard synchronization

                 Situation 1: install new <b>foo</b> and <b>libfoo1</b>

                 Situation 2: give up with an error tree, (assuming <b>foo</b> depends on <b>libfoo1</b>, if it does not, then
                 install new <b>foo</b>, remove <b>libfoo1</b>)

   <b>Resolver</b> <b>tuning</b>
   <b>score</b>
       Cupt's native dependency problem resolver plans system changes, if needed, to make installed packages set
       correct after making the changes user demand.

       In the most cases, there are several solutions to a problem. To  choose  amongst  them,  resolver  assign
       <b>scores</b> to all of them.

       Score  is  an  integer  (positive  or  negative)  and is a sum of version weight difference and an action
       modifier. Version weight, or "normalized version priority", is a version pin value minus  a  default  pin
       for  a preferred versions.  Action modifiers are action type-specific addendums and are controlled by the
       option group <b>cupt::resolver::score::</b><u>X</u> (see the full list of them in <u><a href="../man5/cupt.conf.5.html">cupt.conf</a>(5)</u>).

       For native resolver, the negative scores  indicate  "negative"  changes,  and  positive  scores  indicate
       "positive"  changes.  When several alternative solutions for a problem are available, they are considered
       in the score descending order.  The ultimate goal of score system to assign positive scores to everything
       user wants and negative scores to everything user doesn't want. But since "positive"  and  "negative"  is
       something  that  varies from user to user and from action to action, there is no (and cannot be) a silver
       bullet.

       So, how can you adjust solution scores? From the definition of the score (above) you may  adjust  version
       pinning and/or set resolver score variables to different values.

       Examples:

       $ echo 'q' | cupt -s -t experimental full-upgrade --summary-only | grep "^  "
       W: some solutions were dropped, you may want to increase the value of the 'cupt::resolver::max-solution-count' option
         0 manually installed and 48 automatically installed packages will be installed
         129 manually installed and 474 automatically installed packages will be upgraded
         0 manually installed and 32 automatically installed packages will be removed
         2 manually installed and 17 automatically installed packages will have a not preferred version
       $ echo 'q' | cupt -s -t experimental full-upgrade --summary-only -o cupt::resolver::score::unsatisfied-recommends=250 | grep "^  "
       W: some solutions were dropped, you may want to increase the value of the 'cupt::resolver::max-solution-count' option
         0 manually installed and 43 automatically installed packages will be installed
         129 manually installed and 473 automatically installed packages will be upgraded
         0 manually installed and 34 automatically installed packages will be removed
         2 manually installed and 14 automatically installed packages will have a not preferred version
         4 dependency problems will stay unresolved
       $ echo 'q' | cupt -s -t experimental full-upgrade --summary-only -o cupt::resolver::score::new=-1000 | grep "^  "
       W: some solutions were dropped, you may want to increase the value of the 'cupt::resolver::max-solution-count' option
         0 manually installed and 30 automatically installed packages will be installed

         7 dependency problems will stay unresolved
       $ echo 'q' | cupt -s -t experimental full-upgrade --summary-only -o cupt::resolver::score::new=-1000 -o cupt::resolver::score::downgrade=0 | grep "^  "
       W: some solutions were dropped, you may want to increase the value of the 'cupt::resolver::max-solution-count' option

         4 dependency problems will stay unresolved

   <b>maximum</b> <b>solution</b> <b>count</b>
       When  an  amount  of  available  solutions  is  big,  you may see the following message while resolver is
       operating:

       <b>W:</b>   <b>some</b>   <b>solutions</b>   <b>were</b>   <b>dropped,</b>   <b>you</b>   <b>may</b>   <b>want</b>    <b>to</b>    <b>increase</b>    <b>the</b>    <b>value</b>    <b>of</b>    <b>the</b>
       <b>'cupt::resolver::max-solution-count'</b> <b>option</b>

       Cupt's native resolver may have only limited amount of different solutions in the memory, and this amount
       is  determined by the value of the <b>cupt::resolver::max-solution-count</b> option. The default value is enough
       for requests of small and medium complexity, but may be not enough for request of  high  complexity.  So,
       for  systems  where  there  is enough free RAM, consider increasing the value to values like 4000 or even
       16000.
