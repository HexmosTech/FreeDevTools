       vf1-tutorial — a tutorial for the <u><a href="../man1/vf1.1.html">vf1</a></u>(1) command line gopher client

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man1/vf1.1.html">vf1</a></u>(1)  is  built  around  an  interactive command prompt, and has a very “REPL” feeling.  You can safely
       unplug your mouse the entire time you are using <u><a href="../man1/vf1.1.html">vf1</a></u>(1).  :)

       There's a comprehensive list of the available commands on the <u><a href="../man1/vf1.1.html">vf1</a></u>(1) man page.

       Start VF-1:

             <b>vf1</b>

       Well, let's start off by heading to SDF to check out some nice phlogs!  Use the <b>go</b> command:

             <b>VF-1&gt;</b> <b>go</b> <b>sdf.org/</b>

       If you are lazy, you can type ‘g sdf.org/’ instead, i.e. you can abbreviate <b>go</b> to <b>g</b>.

       You should see a listing of the SDF Gopherspace.  The different menu items are indicated  by  numbers  in
       square brackets, and the SDF Member PHLOGOSPHERE is option [1], so go ahead and type <b>1</b> and then enter:

             <b>VF-1&gt;</b> <b>1</b>

       You should see all the phlogs fly by, and unless you have a very large monitor some have probably run off
       the top of the screen.  This will not be an uncommon problem, and there are various ways to deal with it.
       Obviously,  you  can  scroll  up in your terminal like always, but VF-1 gives you other ways to deal with
       this.  After you have visited a gopher menu (as opposed to a document), if you  just  press  Enter  (i.e.
       execute  an empty line), VF-1 will print the first 10 items in the menu by themselves (any ASCII art etc.
       in the original listing is removed in this mode).  Each time you press Enter you will see  the  next  ten
       items  in the listing.  Page through a few times to get a feel for it.  There are other ways to deal with
       gopher menus which don't fit on one screen, but nothing is faster than just tapping Enter, so it's a good
       habit to pick up.

       If you just want to see which phlogs have been updated lately, seeing the first 10 or 20  menu  items  is
       probably enough for you.  But suppose you are really curious about one phlog in particular.  Say you want
       to know what Tomasino has been up to.  You could search for his phlog specifically:

             <b>VF-1&gt;</b> <b>search</b> <b>tom</b>

       If you are lazy, you can use <b>/</b> instead of <b>search</b>, i.e. <b>/</b> <b>tom</b>.

       This  will show you the phlogs with “tom” in them (it's a simple case-insensitive search).  Tomasino will
       probably be [1] or [2] (depends whether tomatobodhi has updated more recently :).  So go ahead and type <b>1</b>
       and hit enter again to enter Tomasino's gopherhole.  Then you can type <b>2</b> and enter to go  to  his  phlog,
       and then <b>1</b> and enter to read his most recent entry.

       Suppose now you want to go back to the main SDF phlog listing.  Let's check out your history:

             <b>VF-1&gt;</b> <b>history</b>

       If you are lazy, you can abbreviate <b>history</b> to <b>hist</b>, and in fact if you are very lazy you can just use <b>h</b>.

       You  should  this  time  see  a  menu  of  the few places you've been so far.  The phlogosphere list will
       probably be [2], so type <b>2</b> and enter to go back there.  By now you are probably getting the hang of using
       numbers to get around.

       For this next bit, let's focus on gunnarfrost's phlog, because he writes very nice  short  entries  which
       work well for this.  Once you're at the main phlog listing, do a:

             <b>VF-1&gt;</b> <b>search</b> <b>frost</b>

       To easily find gunnarfrost's phlog and then press <b>1</b> to type the first entry.

       Short and sweet!  Now, suppose you want to read his next post.  You <u>could</u> use the <b>back</b> command to go back
       to  the  menu listing and then press <b>2</b>, and then do <b>back</b> and <b>3</b>, <b>back</b> and <b>4</b>, etc.  But it's much easier to
       just type:

             <b>VF-1&gt;</b> <b>next</b>

       Or, if you are lazy, just <b>n</b>.

       This will automatically take you to the next item in the most recently seen gopher menu after the one you
       just viewed.  So you can just hit <b>n</b> and enter again and again to  flip  through  the  pages  of  gunnar's
       phlog.  Each one is much shorter than a full screen, so this works very nicely.

       Lately gunnarfrost is a good phlogger and wraps his entries at 70 or 80 chars or thereabouts.  But if you
       keep hitting <b>n</b> you'll get to early entries where the lines just keep going until your terminal wraps them
       (sorry,  gunnarfrost,  I  don't  mean  to  single you out here, plenty of other folk do this too!).  Once
       you've found one of these, try running:

             <b>VF-1&gt;</b> <b>fold</b>

       And VF-1 will wrap the lines at 80 chars for you (assuming you have  the  <u><a href="../man1/fold.1.html">fold</a></u>(1)  command  installed  on
       whatever  system you are using).  This isn't the only helper command of this kind available.  Get back to
       the main SDF phlog listing (either by running <b>back</b> a few times  or  using  <b>hist</b>  and  a  number  to  jump
       straight  to  it)  and  go  to my phlog.  Unlike gunnarfrost, I appear to be physiologically incapable of
       writing phlog posts which are less than a few whole screens long.  Go to one of these  posts,  and  watch
       the lines fly by.  Now try:

             <b>VF-1&gt;</b> <b>less</b>

       This  will pipe my giant entry through <u><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></u>(1), so you can move back and forth and read it.  Just press <b>q</b>
       when you're done like usual to get your VF-1 prompt back.  You can also use <b>less</b> to navigate long  menus,
       and  unlike  hitting Enter to page through items 10 at a time, <b>less</b> will preserve non-entry lines, so you
       can see ASCII art etc.

       I usually have at least one reference at the end of that entry, formatted as a URL after an index  number
       in  square  brackets.   You  might  be tempted to pick up your mouse, highlight the URL, type <b>go</b> and then
       paste the URL to visit it.  Put that rodent down!  The mouse, that is, not the gopher.  Instead, try this
       command:

             <b>VF-1&gt;</b> <b>links</b>

       VF-1 will then scan the most recently viewed post for URLs.  Well, actually, it  scans  for  words  (i.e.
       things  separated by spaces) which contain "://" and at least one ".".  This might not catch all URLs and
       it might sometimes catch things which are not URLs, but it works well enough for now.   You  will  see  a
       menu and now you can use numbers to follow any of those links without your mouse!

       If you want to know the URL of a document you are at so that you can refer to it, just do:

             <b>VF-1&gt;</b> <b>url</b>

       If you want to save the document, just do:

             <b>VF-1&gt;</b> <b>save</b> <b><a href="file:~/some/random/path/somefilename.txt">~/some/random/path/somefilename.txt</a></b>

       If you're in a hurry, you can just do:

             <b>VF-1&gt;</b> <b>save</b>

       and VF-1 will try to derive a sensible filename from the current document's URL.  There's no guarantee it
       will be pretty, or easy to remember, though.

       Everything so far has been text-based.  Gopher items with itemtype 0 (text) are fed to the <u><a href="../man1/cat.1.html">cat</a></u>(1) command
       by  default, or to <u><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></u>(1) or <u><a href="../man1/fold.1.html">fold</a></u>(1) if you request it.  But VF-1 can handle other itemtypes too.  Image
       files with an item type of “g” or “I” will be opened using the <u><a href="../man1/feh.1.html">feh</a></u>(1) image viewer (if installed).   HTML
       content  with  an  item  type of “h” will be fed to <b>lynx</b> <b>--dump</b>, and audio files with an item type of “a”
       will be fed to <u><a href="../man1/mpg123.1.html">mpg123</a></u>(1) (e.g. you can listen to jynx's doom metal songs in this way).  Obviously if  you
       do  not  have  one  of  these  programs  installed, it will not work.  Fear not, there's a way for you to
       customise these handler programs - see the “Handlers” section below for all the details.

       You probably need some bookmarks, right?  Here's how to add the current URL to your bookmarks.   You  can
       provide your own name, if you want.

             <b>VF-1&gt;</b> <b>add</b>

       Or, if you are lazy as usual, just <b>a</b>.

       If you want to reorganize your bookmarks, just open <u><a href="file:~/.vf1-bookmarks.txt">~/.vf1-bookmarks.txt</a></u> using a text editor and do it.

       If you want to look at your bookmarks:

             <b>VF-1&gt;</b> <b>bookmarks</b>

       If lazy, just <b>bm</b>.

       Now let's look at two tools for quick and easy navigation through gopherspace, tours and marks.

       Sometimes  you're  looking  at  a menu and it's very long but you know you want to look at few items, one
       after another.  Assume you're looking at phlogosphere.org, for example.  How about adding the first  four
       items to a <b>tour</b> and then going on that tour?

             VF-1&gt; tour 1 2 3 4
             VF-1&gt; tour

       Use the tour command without any arguments to go to the next stop.  This is basically your stack of items
       to go to.  And yes, you guessed it.  Use <b>t</b> if you're feeling lazy.

       Actually, if you're really lazy, you can use ranges, too:

             VF-1&gt; tour 1-4
             VF-1&gt; tour

       But  there's  more.   Let's  say you're looking at something pretty interesting, like the list of all the
       phlogs on phlogosphere.org.  How about marking this place with a letter, following some links,  and  then
       returning to this location not using a bunch of <b>back</b> and <b>up</b> commands but just that one letter?

             VF-1&gt; mark x
             VF-1&gt; ... do some stuff ...
             VF-1&gt; go x

       And yes, <b>m</b> for the lazy.

       With  this you now have a pretty good idea about how to use and navigate around on VF-1.  Happy gophering
       !!
