       openvpn3-linux - OpenVPN 3 Linux Overview

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       OpenVPN  3  Linux  is  an  OpenVPN  platform  which  builds  on  capabilities  available  on  newer Linux
       distributions.  Compared to the more classic OpenVPN 2.x generation, OpenVPN 3  Linux  covers  many  more
       aspects of the VPN configuration and session life-cycle.

       To  quickly  compare them, OpenVPN 2.x is a single process which is responsible for a single VPN session.
       There are no configuration or session management in  OpenVPN  2.x  itself,  it  depends  on  the  systemd
       openvpn-client@.service  and  openvpn-server@.service  unit files, the Network Manager OpenVPN plug-in or
       other third-party management tools.

       OpenVPN 3 Linux provides full configuration and session management in addition to the VPN tunnel  itself.
       For  example,  it  has built in privilege separation and execution models, for improved process security.
       This allows unprivileged users to  start  their  own  VPN  sessions  and  manage  them  themselves.   VPN
       configuration files can be shared with other users on the system or kept private.

       Through this privilege separation model, network configuration aspect of the VPN tunnel is split out into
       its  own  process  which  runs with as few privileges as possible.  In practice that means it can only to
       network configuration changes.  This network configuration service is also capable of setting up the  DNS
       resolver  out-of-the-box.   For  OpenVPN  2.x  to do that, it would need to run additional scripts or use
       specific plug-ins to trigger such updates on the system.

       With this architecture, OpenVPN 3 Linux is split up into several services running independently  of  each
       other.   These services are referred to as <u>backend</u> <u>services</u>.  The interaction with these services happens
       through what is referred to as a <u>user</u> <u>front-end</u>.

</pre><h4><b>USER</b> <b>FRONT-ENDS</b></h4><pre>
       There are several user front-ends tools which is used to interact with the various components of  OpenVPN
       3 Linux.

       • <b>openvpn2</b>

         This  aims to be fairly similar to the more classic <b><a href="../man8/openvpn.8.html">openvpn</a></b>(8) command line, with the exception that it
         only processes client related options.

       • <b>openvpn3</b>

         This is the main utility for managing all the features available in OpenVPN 3 Linux and has a different
         user interface than <b><a href="../man1/openvpn2.1.html">openvpn2</a></b>(1)  or  <b><a href="../man8/openvpn.8.html">openvpn</a></b>(8).   On  systems  with  the  bash-completion  integration
         installed, almost every command, option and argument used by <b>openvpn3</b> will get auto-completion help.

       • <b>openvpn3-admin</b>

         This utility is mostly targeting system administrators and provides interfaces to do some management of
         the various OpenVPN 3 D-Bus services.  See <b><a href="../man8/openvpn3-admin.8.html">openvpn3-admin</a></b>(8) for more details.

       • <b>openvpn3-session@.service</b> (<b>openvpn3-systemd</b>)

         VPN    sessions   can   be   started   and   managed   directly   via   <b><a href="../man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl</a></b>(1)   by   using   the
         <b>openvpn3-session@.service</b> service unit.  This also enables VPN sessions  to  be  started  automatically
         during system boot.  This service unit uses a helper utility, <b><a href="../man1/openvpn3-systemd.1.html">openvpn3-systemd</a></b>(1) which works as a glue
         layer between the OpenVPN 3 Linux services and <b>systemd</b>

       In  addition,  a  Python  3  module  is  also  available  making  it possible to write your own OpenVPN 3
       front-ends with little extra efforts.  Both <b>openvpn2</b> and <b>openvpn3-systemd</b>  are  Python  3  scripts  which
       makes use of this OpenVPN 3 Python module.

</pre><h4><b>OPENVPN</b> <b>3</b> <b>D-BUS</b> <b>SERVICES</b></h4><pre>
       The  front-end interfaces talks to services which are started automatically when needed and usually stops
       running if they are not in use.  There are several services, where each service only is responsible for a
       fairly small set of features.

       • <b>Configuration</b> <b>Manager</b> (<b>openvpn3-service-configmgr</b>)

         This provides a service which only takes care of managing VPN configuration profiles for all  users  on
         the  system.   It has a built in Access Control List mechanism, which ensures only users granted access
         can access the information they need.

         D-Bus name: <u>net.openvpn.v3.configuration</u>

       • <b>Session</b> <b>Manager</b> (<b>openvpn3-service-sessionmgr</b>)

         This service takes care of managing running OpenVPN sessions on the system.  This has also its own  set
         of  Access  Control  List  mechanisms,  where users on the system can be granted access to VPN sessions
         started by other users.  The default behaviour is to only let the user starting a  VPN  session  manage
         and access it.

         D-Bus name: <u>net.openvpn.v3.sessions</u>

       • <b>VPN</b> <b>Client</b> <b>Backend</b> (<b>openvpn3-service-client</b>)

         This is the core VPN client.  There will be running one such process per active VPN session.

         D-Bus name: <u>net.openvpn.v3.backends.be${PID}</u>

       • <b>VPN</b> <b>Backend</b> <b>Starter</b> (<b>openvpn3-service-backendstart</b>)

         This is a helper service which is used by the Session Manager to start a new VPN backend service.  When
         a  client  profile  is  requested  started,  it  will  start an <b>openvpn3-service-client</b> process per VPN
         session.

         D-Bus name: <u>net.openvpn.v3.backends</u>

       • <b>Network</b> <b>Configuration</b> (<b>openvpn3-service-netcfg</b>)

         This is the most privileged D-Bus service, and is used by the Backend VPN Client  processes.   This  is
         responsible  for  creating  and  manage  virtual  network interfaces, configure IP addresses, routes in
         addition to handling the DNS setup.

         D-Bus name: <u>net.openvpn.v3.netcfg</u>

       • <b>Logging</b> (<b>openvpn3-service-log</b>)

         This is responsible to receive log events from all the  services  above  and  ensure  they  get  logged
         properly.   Whether  that  is  to  a terminal, a log file or syslog, depends on the configuration.  The
         default is to start this service using the syslog integration.

         D-Bus name: <u>net.openvpn.v3.log</u>

       All of these services above are D-Bus services which is available  on  the  system  bus.   They  are  all
       automatically started when needed.

</pre><h4><b>D-BUS</b> <b>POLICY</b></h4><pre>
       D-Bus  enforces  usage  of  a policy which defines who can access which D-Bus service and which features,
       objects and properties provided by a D-Bus service.

       The  default  OpenVPN  3  Linux  policy  is  placed  in  several   files   prefixed   <b>net.openvpn.v3</b>   in
       <b><a href="file:/usr/share/dbus-1/system.d">/usr/share/dbus-1/system.d</a></b>.   The  default  policy  provided  by  OpenVPN 3 Linux allows all users on the
       system to load, start and manage their own OpenVPN configuration profiles and VPN sessions.

       All the D-Bus services will start automatically when their services are requested by a  front-end.   Each
       service     has     their     own    D-Bus    service    definition,    which    can    be    found    in
       <b>/usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/net.openvpn.v3.*.service</b>.

       When an OpenVPN 3 Linux D-Bus service has been idle for a certain time and it does not need  to  preserve
       any  data  kept  in memory, it will automatically stop running.  See the man page for each service to see
       default idle time.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>OPENVPN</b> <b>2.X</b></h4><pre>
       OpenVPN 3 is mostly compatible with most of the client options found in OpenVPN 2.x.  But there are  some
       important details where it differs.

       • No TAP support

         OpenVPN 3 does not support TAP interfaces, only TUN interfaces.  This is by design, as all OS platforms
         which  provides  a  VPN API (Apple iOS, macOS, Android, Microsoft Universal Windows Platform) does only
         support TUN interfaces.

       • <b>--fragment</b> is not supported

         While the use-cases for this feature is acknowledged, it is not considered an easy feature to implement
         and it is being worked on alternatives which gives a  reasonably  equivalent  user  experience  without
         using  <b>--fragment</b> where this will be automatically configured.  If it turns out an alternative approach
         is impossible, this feature might be implemented in the end.

       • Currently no PKCS#11 support

         This is a bigger task which will be worked on later, but it will attempt to  integrate  better  on  the
         overall Linux platform instead of providing an OpenVPN specific implementation.

       These  are  the  most obvious features users will notice.  This list might be extended as we receive more
       feedback.
