</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bilibop - run Debian GNU/Linux from an external media

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  lot  of GNU/Linux distributions - at least the most popular of them - provide freely downloadable <u>.iso</u>
       or <u>.img</u> disk images that can be copied on a USB memory  stick  (sometimes  with  just  <b><a href="../man1/cat.1.html">cat</a></b>(1)  or  <b><a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a></b>(1),
       sometimes in a more complicated way) and immediately usable 'as is'.

       But  such  operating  systems  are  not  designed  to be modified; they are read-only, and even when they
       provide a 'persistent' feature, it is limited. Additionally, they are currently  unmaintainable,  in  the
       sense  that  rebuild  the  complete  image of the root filesystem is the only way to update the system or
       modify its settings in depth. This is often a hard or heavy task that cannot  be  done  from  the  system
       itself:  this  needs  a dedicated work space, outside of the running system, and this often needs another
       operating system to replace the disk image by the new one; and some of these tasks can be  done  only  by
       experienced users.  Others have to wait for the next release, if it comes a day.

       <b>Bilibop</b>  stands  for '<b>B</b>ilibop <b>I</b>s <b>L</b>ive <b>I</b>nstall <b>B</b>oot <b>O</b>n <b>P</b>endrive'.  This recursive acronym is now obsolete,
       but the name has been kept. The <b>bilibop</b> <b>project</b> is born as an alternative to the <b>LiveUSB</b> systems.

       By performing a standard installation of Debian directly on a removable media — currently a USB key or an
       external HDD — it is possible to use it as a LiveUSB system, with the big difference that it behaves like
       any installed Debian OS: it can be maintained, modified, updated, or even broken by the root user at  any
       time.  In fact, without specific settings, it can be broken by an unprivileged user at any time; but this
       is also the case of LiveUSB systems.

       So, <b>bilibop</b> is a collection of scripts using or used by other programs (<b><a href="../man7/initramfs-tools.7.html">initramfs-tools</a></b>(7),  <b><a href="../man7/udev.7.html">udev</a></b>(7),  or
       <b>GRUB2</b>)  to  help  admins  to  maintain  a  <b>Debian</b> <b>GNU/Linux</b> operating system installed on a removable and
       writable media, even if some of these scripts may also be used in other contexts. One of its  main  goals
       is  to  fix security issues or harden standard rules and policies, to make the system more robust in this
       particular situation. Instead of yet another new, living fast and dying young, Debian based distribution,
       bilibop has been designed as a set of few debian packages.  <b>bilibop-lockfs</b> may also  be  installed  on  a
       laptop  or  on  a  public  computer  as  an alternative to <b>fsprotect</b> or <b>overlayroot</b>, and <b>bilibop-udev</b> (or
       <b>bilibop-rules</b>) <u>should</u> also be installed on a LiveUSB.

</pre><h4><b>BILIBOP</b> <b>PACKAGES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>bilibop</u>
         This is a meta package, depending on several  other  binary  packages  from  the  same  <b>bilibop</b>  source
         package.

       <u>bilibop-common</u>
         It  mainly  provides  shell  functions and documentation. See <u>README.Debian</u> in the documentation of the
         package for details about these functions.  It also includes the <b><a href="../man1/drivemap.1.html">drivemap</a></b>(1) command.

       <u>bilibop-rules</u>
         This package provides udev rules and helper scripts. Its main purpose is  to  fix  the  external  drive
         hosting  the  running system, and all its partitions, as owned by the '<u>disk</u>' group instead of '<u>floppy</u>',
         as done by the common udev rules applied to removable media. This is a workaround of the  bug  <b>#645466</b>.
         The  udev  rules provided by this package work even when the root filesystem is on a <b>LUKS</b> device, a <b>LVM</b>
         Logical Volume, a <b>loop</b> device or is an <b><a href="../man5/aufs.5.html">aufs</a></b>(5) or <b>overlay</b> mountpoint.  <b>bilibop-rules</b> also includes  the
         <b><a href="../man8/lsbilibop.8.html">lsbilibop</a></b>(8)  command,  and some helper scripts in <u>/usr/share/bilibop</u>, that can be executed manually or
         with '<b>dpkg-reconfigure</b> <b>bilibop-rules</b>'.  See <u>README.Debian</u> in  the  documentation  of  the  package  for
         details.

       <u>bilibop-udev</u>
         This  package  is  a  kind  of subset of <b>bilibop-rules</b>, and is more suited for LiveUSB systems. It just
         makes that the drive hosting the running system, and all its partitions, belong  to  the  '<b>disk</b>'  group
         instead  of  '<b>floppy</b>'.  Its udev rules also create a symlink <b>(</b><u>/dev/bilibop</u><b>)</b> pointing to the drive name.
         See <u>README.Debian</u> in the documentation of the package for details.

       <u>bilibop-lockfs</u>
         By using an initramfs script and a <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8) helper script, filesystems are mounted as readonly branches
         of a union filesystem (either  <b><a href="../man5/aufs.5.html">aufs</a></b>(5)  or  <b>overlay</b>)  the  corresponding  writable  branches  being  on
         temporary  filesystems.   Additionally,  block  devices  are set readonly too, avoiding low-level write
         access on them, even by root. All this makes the operating system unbreakable, unless  with  a  hammer.
         See <u>README.Debian</u> in the documentation of the package for details.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Debian</b> can be installed on a removable drive as it is on an internal one, except:

       • It  is  highly  recommended  to  install a full encrypted system. Otherwise, what can happen if the USB
         stick or the external HDD has been lost or forgotten somewhere, or even  thieft  ?  Unfortunately  (but
         there are evident security reasons), this can not be fully preseeded.

       • Due  to write-cycles limits on flash memory, it is not recommended to use a swap area on them: this can
         dramatically decrease the lifetime of the drive.

       • Even if the <b>amd64</b> is now the most common architecture on modern <b>P</b>ersonal <b>C</b>omputers, installation  of  a
         <b>x86</b> system will make it more versatile and work both on amd64 and i386 architectures (and even on ia32,
         but this needs at least a specific partition scheme).

       • Take  care,  near  the end of the installation, that the bootloader will be installed on the MBR of the
         drive where the system has been freshly installed: choosing the default 'install on MBR'  will  install
         it on the Master Boot Record of the first disk !

       • Taking  previous recommendations into account, choose '<b>Expert</b> <b>Install</b>' or '<b>Expert</b> <b>Graphical</b> <b>Install</b>' in
         the installer boot menu. if you have to install Debian on several devices, don't perform  an  automated
         installation  via  the '<b>Auto</b> <b>Install</b>' option in the installer boot menu. If you really need to automate
         this process to win time, use a <b>preseed</b> file instead.

</pre><h4><b>SETTINGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The main advantage of a standard installation over a Live system is that the installed  one  can  exactly
       answer  your  needs:  if  the  needs  change,  the system can be easily modified. It can be installed and
       configured to be used as/for:

       • daily usage (this is my case)
       • router and/or firewall for a LAN
       • ftp and/or http server (this is my case)
       • forensics and rescue system (this is may case)
       • embedded Debian repository (this is my case)
       • testing system
       • educational purposes
       • others

       Because an operating system running from an external device is generally  used  on  different  computers,
       with  potentially  different  keyboards,  architectures,  monitors, and so on, it could need some special
       settings to be as versatile as possible. Maybe the field is too large to be covered into a single  manual
       page:  see  <u>/usr/share/doc/bilibop-common/misc/*</u>  for some tips and tricks, details and suggestions about
       possible settings.
