</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       org.debian.apt.transaction - the main interface of an aptdaemon transaction

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Each   transaction   is   represented   as   an   unique   D-Bus   object,   e.g.   at   the  D-Bus  path
       <u>/or/debian/apt/transaction/12123-123-123213</u>.  Which provides the following interface.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>METHODS</b>
       <b>ProvideMedium</b>
              <b>ProvideMedium</b>  <b>(in</b> <b>'s'</b> <u>medium</u><b>)</b>

              Continue a paused transaction which is waiting for the given <u>medium</u>.

              If a media change is required to e.g. install packages from  a  CD/DVD  the  transaction  will  be
              paused  and  the  RequiredMedium  property  changed  to an array of the <u>medium</u> <u>label</u> and its <u>mount</u>
              <u>point</u>.  Furthermore the MediumRequired signal will be emitted.

       <b>ResolveConfigFileConflict</b>
              <b>ResolveConfigFilePrompt</b>  <b>(in</b> <b>'s'</b> <u>config</u><b>,</b>
                                  <b>in</b> <b>'s'</b> <u>answer</u><b>)</b>

              Continue a paused transaction which is waiting for  an  answer  to  handle  a  configuration  file
              conflict.  <u>Config</u> is the path to the current configuration file and <u>answer</u> can be either "replace"
              or "keep".

              If  a  later  config  file  is  shipped  in  a package which overrides some user modifications the
              transaction will be paused and the ConfigFileConflict property of the transaction will be  set  to
              an  array  of  the  old  and new configuration file path. The later one is supposed to replace the
              former one.  Furthermore the ConfigFileConflict signal will be emitted.

       <b>Simulate</b>
              <b>Simulate</b>  <b>()</b>

              Simulate the transaction and calculate dependencies, required disk space and download size.  If  a
              transaction would fail the corresponding error will be raised.

       <b>Run</b>    <b>Run</b>  <b>()</b>

              Queue  the  transaction for processing. Afterwards there cannot be made any further changes to the
              transaction, e.g. modifing the http proxy.

       <b>Cancel</b> <b>Cancel</b>    <b>()</b>

              Cancel the transaction if possible.

   <b>SIGNALS</b>
       <b>Finished</b>
              <b>Finished</b>  <b>('s'</b> <u>exit_state</u><b>)</b>

              The signal will be emitted when the transaction has been processed. The  <u>exit_state</u>  indicates  if
              the transaction was completed, cancelled or failed.

       <b>MediumRequired</b>
              <b>MediumRequired</b> <b>('s'</b> <u>label</u><b>,</b>
                             <b>'s'</b> <u>mount_point</u><b>)</b>

              The  signal  will  be  emitted  if the transaction has been paused and waits for a media change to
              install packages.

       <b>ConfigFileConflict</b>
              <b>ConfigFileConflict</b>  <b>('s'</b> <u>old</u><b>,</b>
                             <b>'s'</b> <u>new</u><b>)</b>

              The signal will be emitted if the transaction has been paused because a <u>new</u> configuration file  is
              shipped in a package which would override changes by the user in the <u>old</u> configuration file.

       <b>PropertyChanged</b>
              <b>PropertyChanged</b>     <b>('s'</b> <u>property_name</u> <u>,</u>
                             <b>'v'</b> <u>value</u><b>)</b>

              The signal will be emitted if one of the following properties has changed.
