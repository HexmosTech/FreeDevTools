       BEGIN - start a transaction block

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       BEGIN [ WORK | TRANSACTION ] [ <u>transaction_mode</u> [, ...] ]

       where <u>transaction_mode</u> is one of:

           ISOLATION LEVEL { SERIALIZABLE | REPEATABLE READ | READ COMMITTED | READ UNCOMMITTED }
           READ WRITE | READ ONLY
           [ NOT ] DEFERRABLE

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BEGIN</b> initiates a transaction block, that is, all statements after a <b>BEGIN</b> command will be executed in a
       single transaction until an explicit <b>COMMIT</b> or <b>ROLLBACK</b> is given. By default (without <b>BEGIN</b>), PostgreSQL
       executes transactions in “autocommit” mode, that is, each statement is executed in its own transaction
       and a commit is implicitly performed at the end of the statement (if execution was successful, otherwise
       a rollback is done).

       Statements are executed more quickly in a transaction block, because transaction start/commit requires
       significant CPU and disk activity. Execution of multiple statements inside a transaction is also useful
       to ensure consistency when making several related changes: other sessions will be unable to see the
       intermediate states wherein not all the related updates have been done.

       If the isolation level, read/write mode, or deferrable mode is specified, the new transaction has those
       characteristics, as if <b>SET</b> <b>TRANSACTION</b> was executed.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       WORK
       TRANSACTION
           Optional key words. They have no effect.

       Refer to SET TRANSACTION (<b><a href="../man7/SET_TRANSACTION.7.html">SET_TRANSACTION</a></b>(7)) for information on the meaning of the other parameters to
       this statement.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>START</b> <b>TRANSACTION</b> has the same functionality as <b>BEGIN</b>.

       Use <b>COMMIT</b> or <b>ROLLBACK</b> to terminate a transaction block.

       Issuing <b>BEGIN</b> when already inside a transaction block will provoke a warning message. The state of the
       transaction is not affected. To nest transactions within a transaction block, use savepoints (see
       <b><a href="../man7/SAVEPOINT.7.html">SAVEPOINT</a></b>(7)).

       For reasons of backwards compatibility, the commas between successive <u>transaction_modes</u> can be omitted.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To begin a transaction block:

           BEGIN;

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BEGIN</b> is a PostgreSQL language extension. It is equivalent to the SQL-standard command <b>START</b> <b>TRANSACTION</b>,
       whose reference page contains additional compatibility information.

       The DEFERRABLE <u>transaction_mode</u> is a PostgreSQL language extension.

       Incidentally, the BEGIN key word is used for a different purpose in embedded SQL. You are advised to be
       careful about the transaction semantics when porting database applications.
