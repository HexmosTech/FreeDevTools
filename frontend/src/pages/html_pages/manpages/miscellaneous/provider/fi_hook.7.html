       fi_hook - The Hook Fabric Provider Utility

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       The  hooking  provider is a utility function that can intercept calls to any provider.  The hook provider
       is always available, but has zero impact on calls unless enabled.  It is useful for providing performance
       data on selected calls or debugging information.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       Hooking support is enabled through the FI_HOOK environment variable.  To enable hooking, FI_HOOK must  be
       set  to  the  name of one or more of the available hooking providers.  When multiple hooks are specified,
       the names must be separated by a semi-colon.  To obtain a list of hooking providers available on the cur‐
       rent system, one can use the fi_info utility with the `–env' command line option.  Hooking providers  are
       usually identified by `hook' appearing in the provider name.

       Known hooking providers include the following:

       <u>ofi_hook_perf</u>
              This  hooks  `fast  path' data operation calls.  Performance data is captured on call entrance and
              exit, in order to provide an average of how long each call takes to complete.  See the PERFORMANCE
              HOOKS section for available performance data.

       <u>ofi_hook_trace</u>
              This hooks most of API calls for fabric communications.  The APIs and their runtime parameters are
              logged to provide detail trace information for debugging.  See the TRACE  HOOKS  section  for  the
              APIs enabled for trace.

       <u>ofi_hook_profile</u>
              This  hooks data operation calls, cq operation calls and mr registration calls.  The API calls and
              the amount of data being operated are accumulated, to provide a view of APIs’ usages  and  a  his‐
              togram  of  data size operated in a workload execution.  See the PROFILE HOOKS section for the re‐
              port in the detail.

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b> <b>HOOKS</b></h4><pre>
       The hook provider allows capturing inline performance data by accessing the  CPU  Performance  Management
       Unit  (PMU).   PMU  data is only available on Linux systems.  Additionally, access to PMU data may be re‐
       stricted to privileged (super-user) applications.

       Performance data is captured for critical data transfer calls:  fi_msg,  fi_rma,  fi_tagged,  fi_cq,  and
       fi_cntr.  Captured data is displayed as logged data using the FI_LOG_LEVEL trace level.  Performance data
       is logged when the associated fabric is destroyed.

       The environment variable FI_PERF_CNTR is used to identify which performance counter is tracked.  The fol‐
       lowing counters are available:

       <u>cpu_cycles</u>
              Counts the number of CPU cycles each function takes to complete.

       <u>cpu_instr</u>
              Counts  the  number of CPU instructions each function takes to complete.  This is the default per‐
              formance counter if none is specified.

</pre><h4><b>TRACE</b> <b>HOOKS</b></h4><pre>
       This hook provider allows tracing each API call and its runtime parameters.  It  is  enabled  by  setting
       FI_HOOK to “trace”.

       The trace data include the provider’s name, API function, and input/output parameter values. The APIs en‐
       abled for tracing include the following:

       <u>data</u> <u>operation</u> <u>calls</u>
              This  include  fi_msg,  fi_rma,  fi_tagged  all data operations.  The trace data contains the data
              buffer, data size being operated, data, tags, and flags when applicable.

       <u>cq</u> <u>operation</u> <u>calls</u>
              This includes fi_cq_read, fi_cq_sread, fi_cq_strerror and all cq operations.  The trace data  con‐
              tains the cq entries based on cq format.

       <u>cm</u> <u>operation</u> <u>calls</u>
              This includes fi_getname, fi_setname, fi_getpeer, fi_connect and all cm operations.  The trace da‐
              ta contains the target address.

       <u>resource</u> <u>creation</u> <u>calls</u>
              This  includes  fi_av_open, fi_cq_open, fi_endpoing, fi_cntr_open and fi_mr operations.  The trace
              data contains the corresponding attributes used for resource creation.

       The trace data is logged after API is invoked using the FI_LOG_LEVEL trace level

</pre><h4><b>PROFILE</b> <b>HOOKS</b></h4><pre>
       This hook provider allows capturing data operation calls and the amount of data being  operated.   It  is
       enabled by setting FI_HOOK to “profile”.

       The  provider  counts the API invoked and accumulates the data size each API call operates.  For data and
       cq operations, instead of accumulating all data together, it breaks down the data size into size  buckets
       and  accumulates  the  amount of data in the corresponding bucket based on the size of the data operated.
       For mr registration operations, it breaks down memory registered per HMEM iface.  At the end when the as‐
       sociated fabric is destroyed, the provider generates a profile report.

       The report contains the usage of data operation APIs, the amount of data received in each CQ  format  and
       the  amount  of  memory registered for rma operations if any exist.  In addition, the data operation APIs
       are grouped into 4 groups based on the nature of the operations, message send (fi_sendXXX,  fi_tsendXXX),
       message  receive  (fi_recvXXX, fi_trecvXXX), rma read (fi_readXXX) and rma write (fi_writeXXX) to present
       the percentage usage of each API.

       The report is in a table format which has APIs invoked in rows, and the  columns  contain  the  following
       fields:

       <u>API</u>    The API calls are invoked.

       <u>Size</u>   Data  size  bucket  that at least one API call operates data in that size bucket.  The pre-defined
              size buckets (in Byte) are [0-64] [64-512] [512-1K] [1K-4K] [4K-64K] [64K-256K] [256K-1M]  [1M-4M]
              [4M-UP].

       <u>Count</u>  Count of the API calls.

       <u>Amount</u> Amount of data the API operated.

       <u>%</u> <u>Count</u>
              Percentage of the API calls over the total API calls in the same data operation group.

       <u>%</u> <u>Amount</u>
              Percentage  of  the amount of data from the API over the total amount of data operated in the same
              data operation group.

       The report is logged using the FI_LOG_LEVEL trace level.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Hooking functionality is not available for providers built using the FI_FABRIC_DIRECT feature.  That  is,
       directly linking to a provider prevents hooking.

       The hooking provider does not work with triggered operations.  Application that use FI_TRIGGER operations
       that attempt to hook calls will likely crash.
