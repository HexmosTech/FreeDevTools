</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pkcs11sign - OpenSSL PKCS#11 sign provider module

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  pkcs11-sign-provider  implements  the  OpenSSL  3.0  provider  interface  and provides cryptographic
       operation on asymmetric key material,  available  in  PKCS#11  infrastructure  (e.g.  opencryptoki).  The
       pkcs11-sign-provider  will  register  a  key  storage  for  PKCS#11  URIs  (RFC 7512). All keys which are
       referenced by a PKCS#11 URI will be handled by the pkcs11-sign-provider.  Other keys  (e.g.   file-based)
       are  forwarded by the pkcs11-sign-provider to another OpenSSL-Provider, e.g. the built-in OpenSSL default
       provider.

       The pkcs11-sign-provider will only process algorithms with existing  (private)  asymmetric  keys  in  the
       related PKCS11-token. All other actions will be handled by the forward-provider as clear-key operations.

       The  pkcs11-sign-provider  does  not support key creation or removal of PKCS#11 keys. For key management,
       external tools are required.

       Supported PKCS#11 mechanisms for RSA:

       • CKM_RSA_PKCS

       • CKM_RSA_PKCS_OAEP

       • CKM_RSA_PSS

       • CKM_RSA_X_509

       Supported PKCS#11 mechanisms for EC:

       • CKM_ECDSA

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       An application, which should  use  asymmetric  keys  in  PKCS#11  infrastructure,  must  use  an  OpenSSL
       configuration  for  the  pkcs11-sign-provider  and  refer  to the keys by an PKCS#11 URI. The rest of the
       application should not need any changes.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       If the system-wide OpenSSL configuration does not configure the pkcs11-sign-provider, the application can
       use its own OpenSSL configuration file and refer to it in its  environment  variable  <u>OPENSSL_CONF</u>.   For
       more details about the configuration see <a href="../man5/pkcs11sign.cnf.5.html">pkcs11sign.cnf</a>(5).

   <b>Key</b> <b>references</b>
       Instead of referring to a private key file (e.g. "file:/path/to/key.pem"), the application should use the
       PKCS#11 URI of the key ("pkcs11:&lt;path-attributes&gt;?&lt;queue-attributes&gt;").

       The  PKCS#11  URI should specify path parameters of the key, at least the ID or label of the key, as well
       as its type. The key reference should be unique.

       Example for a PKCS#11 URI to a private key:
           pkcs11:token=mytok;object=ec-key;type=private&amp;pin-source=/path/to/token-pinfile.txt

       <b>Note</b>   The current version of pkcs11-sign-provider supports  only  the  queue  parameters  <u>pin-value</u>  and
              <u>pin-source</u>.  All other queue parameters are not yet supported.

   <b>PIN</b> <b>handling</b>
       The  PIN is required to login to a PKCS#11 token, to manage or work with sensitive PKCS#11 objects (keys)
       and should not be proposed to anyone without a need-to-know.

       An application, which is using key material in a PKCS#11 token, has  such  a  need-to-know,  so  the  PIN
       should be under control of the application.

       The pkcs11-sign-provider supports the PIN handling in the PKCS#11 URI with the queue attributes <u>pin-value</u>
       and  <u>pin-source</u>.  While the first one contains the plain-text PIN, the latter one refers to a file, which
       contains the PIN. It is highly recommended to use the file reference and set the  access  permissions  of
       the PIN file accordingly.

   <b>PIN</b> <b>file</b>
       The  PIN gives access to a PKCS#11 token and its objects (keys, certificates, data). It should be treated
       as a secret information and only the application should have access to it.  With  the  right  setup,  the
       usage of a PIN file provides the best protection for the PIN.

       Rules for the PIN file:

       • one PIN per PIN file

       • the PIN file must only contain the PIN, no comments, no linefeed or other characters

       • the PIN file must be readable by the application

       • the PIN file should not be writable by the application

       • the PIN file must not be readable nor writable by other unprivileged users.

       The  following snippet shows, how to create a protected PIN file. It will prompt for the PIN and write it
       to a file, which is only accessible for the user.

           PINFILE="/path/to/my_pinfile.txt"
           touch "${PINFILE}"
           chmod u=rw,g=,o= "${PINFILE}"
           (read -rsp "Enter PIN: " PIN; echo -n ${PIN}) &gt; "${PINFILE}"

       If required, the file ownership can later be changed to another user and group. This would require  extra
       capabilities (e.g. by using "sudo").
