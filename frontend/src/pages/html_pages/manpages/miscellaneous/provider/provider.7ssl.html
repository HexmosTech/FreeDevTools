       provider - OpenSSL operation implementation providers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;openssl/provider.h&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>General</b>
       This page contains information useful to provider authors.

       A <u>provider</u>, in OpenSSL terms, is a unit of code that provides one or more implementations for various
       operations for diverse algorithms that one might want to perform.

       An <u>operation</u> is something one wants to do, such as encryption and decryption, key derivation, MAC
       calculation, signing and verification, etc.

       An <u>algorithm</u> is a named method to perform an operation.  Very often, the algorithms revolve around
       cryptographic operations, but may also revolve around other types of operation, such as managing certain
       types of objects.

       See <b><a href="../man7/crypto.7.html">crypto</a></b>(7) for further details.

   <b>Provider</b>
       A <u>provider</u> offers an initialization function, as a set of base functions in the form of an
       <b><a href="../man3/OSSL_DISPATCH.3.html">OSSL_DISPATCH</a></b>(3) array, and by extension, a set of <b><a href="../man3/OSSL_ALGORITHM.3.html">OSSL_ALGORITHM</a></b>(3)s (see <b><a href="../man7/openssl-core.h.7.html">openssl-core.h</a></b>(7)).  It may be
       a dynamically loadable module, or may be built-in, in OpenSSL libraries or in the application.  If it's a
       dynamically loadable module, the initialization function must be named "OSSL_provider_init" and must be
       exported.  If it's built-in, the initialization function may have any name.

       The initialization function must have the following signature:

        int NAME(const OSSL_CORE_HANDLE *handle,
                 const OSSL_DISPATCH *in, const OSSL_DISPATCH **out,
                 void **provctx);

       <u>handle</u> is the OpenSSL library object for the provider, and works as a handle for everything the OpenSSL
       libraries need to know about the provider.  For the provider itself, it is passed to some of the
       functions given in the dispatch array <u>in</u>.

       <u>in</u> is a dispatch array of base functions offered by the OpenSSL libraries, and the available functions
       are further described in <b><a href="../man7/provider-base.7.html">provider-base</a></b>(7).

       <u>*out</u> must be assigned a dispatch array of base functions that the provider offers to the OpenSSL
       libraries.  The functions that may be offered are further described in <b><a href="../man7/provider-base.7.html">provider-base</a></b>(7), and they are the
       central means of communication between the OpenSSL libraries and the provider.

       <u>*provctx</u> should be assigned a provider specific context to allow the provider multiple simultaneous uses.
       This pointer will be passed to various operation functions offered by the provider.

       Note that the provider will not be made available for applications to use until the initialization
       function has completed and returned successfully.

       One of the functions the provider offers to the OpenSSL libraries is the central mechanism for the
       OpenSSL libraries to get access to operation implementations for diverse algorithms.  Its referred to
       with the number <b>OSSL_FUNC_PROVIDER_QUERY_OPERATION</b> and has the following signature:

        const OSSL_ALGORITHM *provider_query_operation(void *provctx,
                                                       int operation_id,
                                                       const int *no_store);

       <u>provctx</u> is the provider specific context that was passed back by the initialization function.

       <u>operation_id</u> is an operation identity (see "Operations" below).

       <u>no_store</u> is a flag back to the OpenSSL libraries which, when nonzero, signifies that the OpenSSL
       libraries will not store a reference to the returned data in their internal store of implementations.

       The returned <b><a href="../man3/OSSL_ALGORITHM.3.html">OSSL_ALGORITHM</a></b>(3) is the foundation of any OpenSSL library API that uses providers for their
       implementation, most commonly in the <u>fetching</u> type of functions (see "ALGORITHM FETCHING" in <b><a href="../man7/crypto.7.html">crypto</a></b>(7)).

   <b>Operations</b>
       Operations are referred to with numbers, via macros with names starting with "OSSL_OP_".

       With each operation comes a set of defined function types that a provider may or may not offer, depending
       on its needs.

       <u>Algorithm</u> <u>naming</u>

       Algorithm names are case insensitive. Any particular algorithm can have multiple aliases associated  with
       it. The canonical OpenSSL naming scheme follows this format:

       ALGNAME[VERSION?][-SUBNAME[VERSION?]?][-SIZE?][-MODE?]

       VERSION  is only present if there are multiple versions of an algorithm (e.g.  MD2, MD4, MD5).  It may be
       omitted if there is only one version.

       SUBNAME may be present where multiple algorithms are combined together, e.g. MD5-SHA1.

       SIZE is only present if multiple versions of an algorithm exist with different sizes  (e.g.  AES-128-CBC,
       AES-256-CBC)

       MODE is only present where applicable.

       Other  aliases  may  exist for example where standards bodies or common practice use alternative names or
       names that OpenSSL has used historically.

       <u>Provider</u> <u>dependencies</u>

       Providers may depend for their proper operation on the availability  of  (functionality  implemented  in)
       other providers. As there is no mechanism to express such dependencies towards the OpenSSL core, provider
       authors  must  take  care  that such dependencies are either completely avoided or made visible to users,
       e.g., by documentation and/or defensive programming, e.g., outputting error messages if required external
       dependencies are not available, e.g., when no provider implementing the required functionality  has  been
       activated.  In  particular,  provider  initialization should not depend on other providers already having
       been initialized.

       <u>Note</u> <u>on</u> <u>naming</u> <u>clashes</u>

       It is possible to register the same algorithm name from within different  providers.  Users  should  note
       that  if  no property query is specified, or more than one implementation matches the property query then
       it is unspecified which implementation of a particular algorithm will be returned.  Such  naming  clashes
       may also occur if algorithms only differ in capitalization as "Algorithm naming" is case insensitive.
