       ANALYZE - collect statistics about a database

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       ANALYZE [ ( <u>option</u> [, ...] ) ] [ <u>table_and_columns</u> [, ...] ]

       where <u>option</u> can be one of:

           VERBOSE [ <u>boolean</u> ]
           SKIP_LOCKED [ <u>boolean</u> ]
           BUFFER_USAGE_LIMIT <u>size</u>

       and <u>table_and_columns</u> is:

           <u>table_name</u> [ ( <u>column_name</u> [, ...] ) ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ANALYZE</b> collects statistics about the contents of tables in the database, and stores the results in the
       pg_statistic system catalog. Subsequently, the query planner uses these statistics to help determine the
       most efficient execution plans for queries.

       Without a <u>table_and_columns</u> list, <b>ANALYZE</b> processes every table and materialized view in the current
       database that the current user has permission to analyze. With a list, <b>ANALYZE</b> processes only those
       table(s). It is further possible to give a list of column names for a table, in which case only the
       statistics for those columns are collected.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       VERBOSE
           Enables display of progress messages.

       SKIP_LOCKED
           Specifies that <b>ANALYZE</b> should not wait for any conflicting locks to be released when beginning work
           on a relation: if a relation cannot be locked immediately without waiting, the relation is skipped.
           Note that even with this option, <b>ANALYZE</b> may still block when opening the relation's indexes or when
           acquiring sample rows from partitions, table inheritance children, and some types of foreign tables.
           Also, while <b>ANALYZE</b> ordinarily processes all partitions of specified partitioned tables, this option
           will cause <b>ANALYZE</b> to skip all partitions if there is a conflicting lock on the partitioned table.

       BUFFER_USAGE_LIMIT
           Specifies the Buffer Access Strategy ring buffer size for <b>ANALYZE</b>. This size is used to calculate the
           number of shared buffers which will be reused as part of this strategy.  0 disables use of a Buffer
           Access Strategy. When this option is not specified, <b>ANALYZE</b> uses the value from
           vacuum_buffer_usage_limit. Higher settings can allow <b>ANALYZE</b> to run more quickly, but having too
           large a setting may cause too many other useful pages to be evicted from shared buffers. The minimum
           value is 128 kB and the maximum value is 16 GB.

       <u>boolean</u>
           Specifies whether the selected option should be turned on or off. You can write TRUE, ON, or 1 to
           enable the option, and FALSE, OFF, or 0 to disable it. The <u>boolean</u> value can also be omitted, in
           which case TRUE is assumed.

       <u>size</u>
           Specifies an amount of memory in kilobytes. Sizes may also be specified as a string containing the
           numerical size followed by any one of the following memory units: B (bytes), kB (kilobytes), MB
           (megabytes), GB (gigabytes), or TB (terabytes).

       <u>table_name</u>
           The name (possibly schema-qualified) of a specific table to analyze. If omitted, all regular tables,
           partitioned tables, and materialized views in the current database are analyzed (but not foreign
           tables). If the specified table is a partitioned table, both the inheritance statistics of the
           partitioned table as a whole and statistics of the individual partitions are updated.

       <u>column_name</u>
           The name of a specific column to analyze. Defaults to all columns.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUTS</b></h4><pre>
       When VERBOSE is specified, <b>ANALYZE</b> emits progress messages to indicate which table is currently being
       processed. Various statistics about the tables are printed as well.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       To analyze a table, one must ordinarily have the MAINTAIN privilege on the table. However, database
       owners are allowed to analyze all tables in their databases, except shared catalogs.  <b>ANALYZE</b> will skip
       over any tables that the calling user does not have permission to analyze.

       Foreign tables are analyzed only when explicitly selected. Not all foreign data wrappers support <b>ANALYZE</b>.
       If the table's wrapper does not support <b>ANALYZE</b>, the command prints a warning and does nothing.

       In the default PostgreSQL configuration, the autovacuum daemon (see Section 24.1.6) takes care of
       automatic analyzing of tables when they are first loaded with data, and as they change throughout regular
       operation. When autovacuum is disabled, it is a good idea to run <b>ANALYZE</b> periodically, or just after
       making major changes in the contents of a table. Accurate statistics will help the planner to choose the
       most appropriate query plan, and thereby improve the speed of query processing. A common strategy for
       read-mostly databases is to run <b>VACUUM</b> and <b>ANALYZE</b> once a day during a low-usage time of day. (This will
       not be sufficient if there is heavy update activity.)

       While <b>ANALYZE</b> is running, the search_path is temporarily changed to pg_catalog, pg_temp.

       <b>ANALYZE</b> requires only a read lock on the target table, so it can run in parallel with other non-DDL
       activity on the table.

       The statistics collected by <b>ANALYZE</b> usually include a list of some of the most common values in each
       column and a histogram showing the approximate data distribution in each column. One or both of these can
       be omitted if <b>ANALYZE</b> deems them uninteresting (for example, in a unique-key column, there are no common
       values) or if the column data type does not support the appropriate operators. There is more information
       about the statistics in Chapter 24.

       For large tables, <b>ANALYZE</b> takes a random sample of the table contents, rather than examining every row.
       This allows even very large tables to be analyzed in a small amount of time. Note, however, that the
       statistics are only approximate, and will change slightly each time <b>ANALYZE</b> is run, even if the actual
       table contents did not change. This might result in small changes in the planner's estimated costs shown
       by <b>EXPLAIN</b>. In rare situations, this non-determinism will cause the planner's choices of query plans to
       change after <b>ANALYZE</b> is run. To avoid this, raise the amount of statistics collected by <b>ANALYZE</b>, as
       described below.

       The extent of analysis can be controlled by adjusting the default_statistics_target configuration
       variable, or on a column-by-column basis by setting the per-column statistics target with <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>...</b>
       <b>ALTER</b> <b>COLUMN</b> <b>...</b> <b>SET</b> <b>STATISTICS</b>. The target value sets the maximum number of entries in the
       most-common-value list and the maximum number of bins in the histogram. The default target value is 100,
       but this can be adjusted up or down to trade off accuracy of planner estimates against the time taken for
       <b>ANALYZE</b> and the amount of space occupied in pg_statistic. In particular, setting the statistics target to
       zero disables collection of statistics for that column. It might be useful to do that for columns that
       are never used as part of the WHERE, GROUP BY, or ORDER BY clauses of queries, since the planner will
       have no use for statistics on such columns.

       The largest statistics target among the columns being analyzed determines the number of table rows
       sampled to prepare the statistics. Increasing the target causes a proportional increase in the time and
       space needed to do <b>ANALYZE</b>.

       One of the values estimated by <b>ANALYZE</b> is the number of distinct values that appear in each column.
       Because only a subset of the rows are examined, this estimate can sometimes be quite inaccurate, even
       with the largest possible statistics target. If this inaccuracy leads to bad query plans, a more accurate
       value can be determined manually and then installed with <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>...</b> <b>ALTER</b> <b>COLUMN</b> <b>...</b> <b>SET</b> <b>(n_distinct</b>
       <b>=</b> <b>...)</b>.

       If the table being analyzed has inheritance children, <b>ANALYZE</b> gathers two sets of statistics: one on the
       rows of the parent table only, and a second including rows of both the parent table and all of its
       children. This second set of statistics is needed when planning queries that process the inheritance tree
       as a whole. The child tables themselves are not individually analyzed in this case. The autovacuum
       daemon, however, will only consider inserts or updates on the parent table itself when deciding whether
       to trigger an automatic analyze for that table. If that table is rarely inserted into or updated, the
       inheritance statistics will not be up to date unless you run <b>ANALYZE</b> manually.

       For partitioned tables, <b>ANALYZE</b> gathers statistics by sampling rows from all partitions; in addition, it
       will recurse into each partition and update its statistics. Each leaf partition is analyzed only once,
       even with multi-level partitioning. No statistics are collected for only the parent table (without data
       from its partitions), because with partitioning it's guaranteed to be empty.

       The autovacuum daemon does not process partitioned tables, nor does it process inheritance parents if
       only the children are ever modified. It is usually necessary to periodically run a manual <b>ANALYZE</b> to keep
       the statistics of the table hierarchy up to date.

       If any child tables or partitions are foreign tables whose foreign data wrappers do not support <b>ANALYZE</b>,
       those tables are ignored while gathering inheritance statistics.

       If the table being analyzed is completely empty, <b>ANALYZE</b> will not record new statistics for that table.
       Any existing statistics will be retained.

       Each backend running <b>ANALYZE</b> will report its progress in the pg_stat_progress_analyze view. See
       Section 27.4.1 for details.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       There is no <b>ANALYZE</b> statement in the SQL standard.

       The following syntax was used before PostgreSQL version 11 and is still supported:

           ANALYZE [ VERBOSE ] [ <u>table_and_columns</u> [, ...] ]
