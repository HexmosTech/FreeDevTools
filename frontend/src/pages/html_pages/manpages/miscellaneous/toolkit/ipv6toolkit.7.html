       ipv6toolkit - An IPv6 security assessment and trouble-shooting toolkit

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  SI6  Networks'  IPv6 Toolkit is a security assessment and trouble-shooting toolkit for IPv6 networks
       and implementations. It provides  a  number  of  tools  to  send  abitrary  IPv6  packets,  perform  IPv6
       address-scans, analyze IPv6 addresses, etc.

       This version of the toolkit (v2.0) includes the following tools:

         * addr6
         * blackhole6
         * flow6
         * frag6
         * icmp6
         * jumbo6
         * na6
         * ni6
         * ns6
         * path6
         * ra6
         * rd6
         * rs6
         * scan6
         * script6
         * tcp6
         * udp6

       <b>addr6</b>  is  an  IPv6 address analysis and manipulation tool. Given a list of IPv6 addresses, it can filter
       such list based on different criteria, such as IPv6 address type, IPv6 address scope, IPv6  prefix,  etc.
       Additionally,  given  a  list of IPv6 addresses <b>addr6</b> can produce statistics on such addresses, including
       address scopes, types, and type of IPv6 interface identifier.  <b>addr6</b> can also analyze a  single  address,
       producing script-friendly output, such that its analysis can be leveraged by other tools or scripts.

       <b>blackhole6</b>  is  a  troubleshooting  tool  which  can find IPv6 where in the network topology packets with
       specific IPv6 Extension Headers are being dropped.

       <b>flow6</b> allows the security assessment of the IPv6 Flow Label. Essentially, it can be leveraged  to  assess
       the Flow Label generation policy of a terget implementation.

       <b>frag6</b>  is  a security assessment tool for the IPv6 fragmentation mechanism. It allows the exploitation of
       fragmentation-based attacks, and can also be employed to assess the  Fragment  Identification  generation
       policy, assess support for IPv6 atomic fragments, etc.

       <b>icmp6</b> is a security assessment tool for the ICMPv6 protocol. It can easily produce arbitrary ICMPv6 error
       messages,  and  includes the capability to generate such messages in response to received traffic.  <b>icmp6</b>
       can also be used to send crafted ICMPv6 messages of arbitrary type/code combinations.

       <b>jumbo6</b> is a secuity assessment tool for IPv6 Jumbograms.

       <b>na6</b> is a security assessment tool for attack vectors based on Neighbor Advertisement messages  (including
       Neighbor Cache poisoning attacks, DAD attacks, etc.).

       <b>ni6</b>  is a security assessment tool for attacks vectors and reconnaissance techniques based on ICMPv6 Node
       Information messages.

       <b>ns6</b> is a security assessment tool for attack vectors based on Neighbor Solicitation  messages  (including
       Neighbor Cache poisoning attacks, Neighbor Cahe exhaustion attacks, etc.).

       <b>path6</b>  is  a  versatile IPv6-based traceroute tool (which supports extension headers, IPv6 fragmentation,
       and other features not present in existing traceroute implementations).

       <b>ra6</b> is a security assessment tool for attack vectors based on Router  Advertisement  messages  (including
       various types of fooding attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and Denial of Service attacks, etc.).

       <b>rd6</b>  is  a  security assessment tool for attack vectors based on ICMPv6 Redirect messages.  It can easily
       produce arbitrary ICMPv6 Redirect messages, and also includes the capability to generate such messages in
       response to received traffic.

       <b>rs6</b> is a security assessment tool for attack vectors based on Router Solicitation messages.

       <b>scan6</b> is a full-fledged IPv6 address scanning tool, which can leverage specific IPv6 address patterns  to
       greatly reduce the search space for "alive" nodes.

       <b>script6</b> is set of scripts/commands that make rather complex and frequent tasks easy.

       <b>tcp6</b>  is  a  security  assessment  tool  for  attack  vectors based on TCP/IPv6 packets. It can be easily
       employed to launch classic TCP-based attacks such as SYN-floods, but can also be employed to launch other
       more complex attacks such as TCP connection floods, etc.

       <b>udp6</b> is a tool for sending arbitrary IPv6-based UDP datagrams.
