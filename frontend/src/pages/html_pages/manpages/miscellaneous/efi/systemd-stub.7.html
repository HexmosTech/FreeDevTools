</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>systemd-stub</b> (stored in per-architecture files linuxx64.efi.stub, linuxia32.efi.stub, linuxaa64.efi.stub
       on disk) is a simple UEFI boot stub. An UEFI boot stub is attached to a Linux kernel binary image, and is
       a piece of code that runs in the UEFI firmware environment before transitioning into the Linux kernel
       environment. The UEFI boot stub ensures a Linux kernel is executable as regular UEFI binary, and is able
       to do various preparations before switching the system into the Linux world.

       The UEFI boot stub looks for various resources for the kernel invocation inside the UEFI PE binary
       itself. This allows combining various resources inside a single PE binary image (a "Unified Kernel Image"
       or "UKI" for short), which may then be signed via UEFI SecureBoot as a whole, covering all individual
       resources at once. Specifically it may include the following PE sections:

       •   A ".linux" section with the ELF Linux kernel image. This section is required.

       •   An optional ".osrel" section with OS release information, i.e. the contents of the <b><a href="../man5/os-release.5.html">os-release</a></b>(5) file
           of the OS the kernel belongs to.

       •   An optional ".cmdline" section with the kernel command line to pass to the invoked kernel.

       •   An optional ".initrd" section with the initrd.

       •   An optional ".ucode" section with an initrd containing microcode, to be handed to the kernel before
           any other initrd. This initrd must not be compressed.

       •   An optional ".splash" section with an image (in the Windows .BMP format) to show on screen before
           invoking the kernel.

       •   An optional ".dtb" section with a compiled binary DeviceTree.

       •   Zero or more ".dtbauto" sections.  systemd-stub will always use the first matching one. The match is
           performed by taking the first DeviceTree's <u>compatible</u> string supplied by the firmware in
           configuration tables and comparing it with the first <u>compatible</u> string from each of the ".dtbauto"
           sections. If the firmware does not provide a DeviceTree, the match is done using the <u>.hwids</u> section
           instead. After selecting a ".hwids" section (see the description below), the <u>compatible</u> string from
           that section will be used to perform the same matching procedure. If a match is found, that
           ".dtbauto" section will be loaded and will override <u>.dtb</u> if present.

       •   Zero or more ".hwids" sections with hardware IDs of the machines to match DeviceTrees.  systemd-stub
           will use the SMBIOS data to calculate hardware IDs of the machine (as per <b>specification</b>[1]), and then
           it will try to find any of them in each of the ".hwids" sections. The first matching section will be
           used.

       •   An optional ".uname" section with the kernel version information, i.e. the output of <b>uname</b> <b>-r</b> for the
           kernel included in the ".linux" section.

       •   An optional ".sbat" section with <b>SBAT</b>[2] revocation metadata.

       •   An optional ".pcrsig" section with a set of cryptographic signatures for the expected TPM2 PCR values
           after the kernel has been booted, in JSON format. This is useful for implementing TPM2 policies that
           bind disk encryption and similar to kernels that are signed by a specific key.

       •   An optional ".pcrpkey" section with a public key in the PEM format matching the signature data in the
           ".pcrsig" section.

       In a basic UKI, the sections listed above appear at most once, with the exception of ".dtbauto" and
       ".hwids" sections. In a multi-profile UKI, multiple sets of these sections are present in a single file
       and form "profiles", one of which can be selected at boot. For this, the PE section ".profile" is defined
       to be used as the separator between sets of sections. The ".profile" section itself may contain
       meta-information about the section, and follows a similar structure as the contents of the ".osrel"
       section. For further details about multi-profile UKIs, see below.

       If UEFI SecureBoot is enabled and the ".cmdline" section is present in the executed image, any attempts
       to override the kernel command line by passing one as invocation parameters to the EFI binary are
       ignored. Thus, in order to allow overriding the kernel command line, either disable UEFI SecureBoot, or
       do not include a kernel command line PE section in the kernel image file. If a command line is accepted
       via EFI invocation parameters to the EFI binary it is measured into TPM PCR 12 (if a TPM is present).

       If a DeviceTree is embedded in the ".dtb" section, it replaces an existing DeviceTree in the
       corresponding EFI configuration table.  <b>systemd-stub</b> will ask the firmware via the
       "EFI_DT_FIXUP_PROTOCOL" for hardware specific fixups to the DeviceTree.

       The contents of 11 of these 12 sections are measured into TPM PCR 11. It is otherwise not used and thus
       the result can be pre-calculated without too much effort. The ".pcrsig" section is not included in this
       PCR measurement, since it is supposed to contain signatures for the output of the measurement operation,
       and thus cannot also be input to it. If an UKI contains multiple profiles, only the PE sections of the
       selected profile (and those of the base profile, except if overridden) are measured.

       If non-zero, the selected numeric profile is measured into PCR 12.

       When ".pcrsig" and/or ".pcrpkey" sections are present in a unified kernel image their contents are passed
       to the booted kernel in an synthetic initrd cpio archive that places them in the
       /.extra/tpm2-pcr-signature.json and /.extra/tpm2-pcr-public-key.pem files. Typically, a <b><a href="../man5/tmpfiles.d.5.html">tmpfiles.d</a></b>(5)
       line then ensures they are copied into /run/systemd/tpm2-pcr-signature.json and
       /run/systemd/tpm2-pcr-public-key.pem where they remain accessible even after the system transitions out
       of the initrd environment into the host file system. Tools such <b>systemd-cryptsetup@.<a href="../man8/service.8.html">service</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man1/systemdcryptenroll.1.html">systemd-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man1/systemdcryptenroll.1.html">cryptenroll</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/systemd-creds.1.html">systemd-creds</a></b>(1) will automatically use files present under these paths to unlock
       protected resources (encrypted storage or credentials) or bind encryption to booted kernels.

       For further details about the UKI concept, see the <b>UKI</b> <b>specification</b>[3].

</pre><h4><b>COMPANION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>systemd-stub</b> UEFI boot stub automatically collects three types of auxiliary companion files
       optionally placed in drop-in directories on the same partition as the EFI binary, dynamically generates
       <b>cpio</b> initrd archives from them, and passes them to the kernel. Specifically:

       •   For a kernel binary called <u>foo</u>.efi, it will look for files with the .cred suffix in a directory named
           <u>foo</u>.efi.extra.d/ next to it. If the kernel binary uses a counter for the purpose of <b>Automatic</b> <b>Boot</b>
           <b>Assessment</b>[4], this counter will be ignored. For example, <u>foo</u>+3-0.efi will look in directory
           <u>foo</u>.efi.extra.d/. A <b>cpio</b> archive is generated from all files found that way, placing them in the
           /.extra/credentials/ directory of the initrd file hierarchy. The main initrd may then access them in
           this directory. This is supposed to be used to store auxiliary, encrypted, authenticated credentials
           for use with <u>LoadCredentialEncrypted=</u> in the UEFI System Partition. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5) and <b><a href="../man1/systemdcreds.1.html">systemd-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man1/systemdcreds.1.html">creds</a></b>(1) for details on encrypted credentials. The generated <b>cpio</b> archive is measured into TPM PCR 12
           (if a TPM is present).

       •   Similarly, files <u>foo</u>.efi.extra.d/*.sysext.raw are packed up in a <b>cpio</b> archive and placed in the
           /.extra/sysext/ directory in the initrd file hierarchy. This is supposed to be used to pass
           additional system extension images to the initrd. See <b><a href="../man8/systemd-sysext.8.html">systemd-sysext</a></b>(8) for details on system
           extension images. The generated <b>cpio</b> archive containing these system extension images is measured
           into TPM PCR 13 (if a TPM is present).

       •   Similarly, files <u>foo</u>.efi.extra.d/*.confext.raw are packed up in a <b>cpio</b> archive and placed in the
           /.extra/confext/ directory in the initrd file hierarchy. This is supposed to be used to pass
           additional configuration extension images to the initrd. See <b><a href="../man8/systemd-confext.8.html">systemd-confext</a></b>(8) for details on
           configuration extension images. The generated <b>cpio</b> archive containing these configuration extension
           images is measured into TPM PCR 12 (if a TPM is present).

       •   Similarly, files <u>foo</u>.efi.extra.d/*.addon.efi are loaded and verified as PE binaries and specific
           sections are loaded from them. Addons are used to pass additional kernel command line parameters
           (".cmdline" section), or DeviceTree blobs (".dtb" section), additional initrds (".initrd" section),
           and microcode updates (".ucode" section). Addons allow those resources to be passed regardless of the
           kernel version being booted, for example allowing platform vendors to ship platform-specific
           configuration.

           In case Secure Boot is enabled, these files will be validated using keys in UEFI DB, Shim's DB or
           Shim's MOK, and only loaded if the check passes. Additionally, if both the addon and the UKI contain
           a ".uname" section, the addon will be rejected if they do not match exactly. It is recommended to
           always add a ".sbat" section to all signed addons, so that they may be revoked with a SBAT policy
           update, without requiring blocklisting via DBX/MOKX. The <b><a href="../man1/ukify.1.html">ukify</a></b>(1) tool will add a SBAT policy by
           default if none is passed when building addons. For more information on SBAT see <b>Shim</b>
           <b>documentation</b>[2].

           Addon files are sorted, loaded, and measured into TPM PCR 12 (if a TPM is present) and appended to
           the kernel command line. UKI command line options are listed first, then options from addons in
           /loader/addons/*.addon.efi, and finally UKI-specific addons. Device tree blobs are loaded and
           measured following the same algorithm. Microcode addons are passed to the kernel in inverse order
           (UKI specific addons, global addons, UKI embedded section). This is because the microcode update
           driver stops on the first matching filename. Addons are always loaded in the same order based on the
           filename, so that, given the same set of addons, the same set of measurements can be expected in
           PCR12. However, note that the filename is not protected by the PE signature, and as such an attacker
           with write access to the ESP could potentially rename these files to change the order in which they
           are loaded, in a way that could alter the functionality of the kernel, as some options might be
           order-dependent. If you sign such addons, you should pay attention to the PCR12 values and make use
           of an attestation service so that improper use of your signed addons can be detected and dealt with
           using one of the aforementioned revocation mechanisms.

       •   Files /loader/credentials/*.cred are packed up in a <b>cpio</b> archive and placed in the
           /.extra/global_credentials/ directory of the initrd file hierarchy. This is supposed to be used to
           pass additional credentials to the initrd, regardless of the kernel version being booted. The
           generated <b>cpio</b> archive is measured into TPM PCR 12 (if a TPM is present).

       •   Additionally, files /loader/addons/*.addon.efi are loaded and verified as PE binaries, and
           ".cmdline", ".dtb", ".initrd", and ".ucode" sections are parsed from them. This is supposed to be
           used to pass additional command line parameters, DeviceTree blobs, initrds, and microcode updates to
           the kernel, regardless of the kernel version being booted.

       These mechanisms may be used to parameterize and extend trusted (i.e. signed), immutable initrd images in
       a reasonably safe way: all data they contain is measured into TPM PCRs. On access they should be further
       validated: in case of the credentials case by encrypting/authenticating them via TPM, as exposed by
       <b>systemd-creds</b> <b>encrypt</b> <b>-T</b> (see <b><a href="../man1/systemd-creds.1.html">systemd-creds</a></b>(1) for details); in case of the system extension images by
       using signed Verity images.

</pre><h4><b>MULTI-PROFILE</b> <b>UKIS</b></h4><pre>
       In many contexts it is useful to allow invocation of a single UKI in multiple different modes (or
       "profiles") without compromising the cryptographic integrity, measurements and so on of the boot process.
       For example, a single UKI might provide three distinct profiles: a regular boot one, one that invokes a
       "factory reset" operation, and one that boots into a storage target mode (as in <b><a href="../man8/systemdstoragetm.service.8.html">systemd-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man8/systemdstoragetm.service.8.html">storagetm.service</a></b>(8)). Each profile would then use the same ".linux" and ".initrd" sections, but would
       have a separate ".cmdline" section. For example the latter two profiles would extend the regular kernel
       command line with "systemd.unit=factory-reset.target" or "rd.systemd.unit=storagetm.target".

       A single UKI may support multiple profiles by means of the special ".profile" PE section. This section
       acts as separator between the PE sections of the individual profiles.  ".profile" PE sections hence may
       appear multiple times in a single UKI, and the other PE sections listed above may appear multiple times
       too, if ".profile" are used, but only once before the first ".profile" section, once between each
       subsequent pair, and once after the last appearance of ".profile". The sections listed before the first
       ".profile" are considered the "base" profile of the UKI. Each ".profile" section then introduces a new
       profile, which are numbered starting from zero. The PE sections following each ".profile" are specific to
       that profile. When booting into a specific profile, the base section's profiles are used in combination
       with the specific profile's sections: if the same section is defined in both, the per-profile section
       overrides the base profile's version, otherwise the base profile sections are used.

       A UKI that contains no ".profile" is consider equivalent to one that just contains a single ".profile",
       as having only a single profile "@0".

       Here's a simple example for a multi-profile UKI's sections, inspired by the setup suggested above:

       <b>Table</b> <b>1.</b> <b>Multi-Profile</b> <b>UKI</b> <b>Example</b>
       ┌────────────┬──────────────┐
       │ <b>Section</b>    │ <b>Profile</b>      │
       ├────────────┼──────────────┤
       │ ".linux"   │              │
       ├────────────┤              │
       │ ".osrel"   │              │
       ├────────────┤ Base profile │
       │ ".cmdline" │              │
       ├────────────┤              │
       │ ".initrd"  │              │
       ├────────────┼──────────────┤
       │ ".profile" │ Profile @0   │
       ├────────────┼──────────────┤
       │ ".profile" │              │
       ├────────────┤ Profile @1   │
       │ ".cmdline" │              │
       ├────────────┼──────────────┤
       │ ".profile" │              │
       ├────────────┤ Profile @2   │
       │ ".cmdline" │              │
       └────────────┴──────────────┘

       The section list above would define three profiles. The first four sections make up the base profile. A
       ".profile" section then introduces profile @0. It does not override any sections (or add any) from the
       base section, hence it is immediately followed by another ".profile" section that then introduces section
       @1. This profile overrides the kernel command line. Finally, the last two sections define section @2,
       again overriding the command line. (Note that in this example the first ".cmdline" could also moved
       behind the first ".profile" with equivalent effect. To keep things nicely extensible, it is probably a
       good idea to keep the generic command line in the base section instead of profile 0, in case later added
       profiles might want to reuse it.)

       The profile to boot may be controlled via the UKI's own command line: if the first argument starts with
       "@", followed by a positive integer number in decimal, it selects the profile to boot into. If the first
       argument is not specified like that, the UKI will automatically boot into profile 0.

       A ".profile" section may contain meta-information about the profile. It follows a similar format as
       ".osrel" (i.e. an environment-variable-assignment-block-like list of newline separated strings).
       Currently two fields are defined: "ID=" is supposed to carry a short identifying string that identifies
       the profile (e.g.  "ID=factory-reset").  "TITLE=" should contain a human readable string that may appear
       in the boot menu entry for this profile (e.g.  "TITLE='Factory Reset this Device'").

</pre><h4><b>TPM</b> <b>PCR</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Note that when a unified kernel using <b>systemd-stub</b> is invoked the firmware will measure it as a whole to
       TPM PCR 4, covering all embedded resources, such as the stub code itself, the core kernel, the embedded
       initrd and kernel command line (see above for a full list), including all UKI profiles.

       Also note that when <b>systemd-stub</b> measures a PE section, it will measure the amount of bytes that the
       section takes up in memory (<u>VirtualSize</u>) and not the amount of bytes that the section takes up on disk
       (<u>SizeOfRawData</u>). This means that if the size in memory is larger than the size on disk, <b>systemd-stub</b> will
       end up measuring extra zeroes. To avoid this from happening, it is recommended to make sure that the size
       in memory of each section that is measured by <b>systemd-stub</b> is always smaller than or equal to the size on
       disk.  <b>ukify</b> automatically makes sure this is the case when building UKIs or addons.

       Also note that the Linux kernel will measure all initrds it receives into TPM PCR 9. This means every
       type of initrd (of the selected UKI profile) will possibly be measured two or three times: the initrds
       embedded in the kernel image will be measured to PCR 4, PCR 9 and PCR 11; the initrd synthesized from
       credentials (and the one synthesized from configuration extensions) will be measured to both PCR 9 and
       PCR 12; the initrd synthesized from system extensions will be measured to both PCR 4 and PCR 9. Let's
       summarize the OS resources and the PCRs they are measured to:

</pre><h4><b>EFI</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following EFI variables are defined, set and read by <b>systemd-stub</b>, under the vendor UUID
       "4a67b082-0a4c-41cf-b6c7-440b29bb8c4f", for communication between the boot stub and the OS:

       <u>LoaderDevicePartUUID</u>
           Contains the partition UUID of the partition the boot loader has been started from on the current
           boot (usually a EFI System Partition). If already set by the boot loader, this will remain untouched
           by <b>systemd-stub</b>. If not set yet, this will be set to the partition UUID of the partition the unified
           kernel is started from, in order to support systems that directly boot into a unified kernel image,
           bypassing any boot loader.  <b><a href="../man8/systemd-gpt-auto-generator.8.html">systemd-gpt-auto-generator</a></b>(8) uses this information to automatically find
           the disk booted from, in order to discover various other partitions on the same disk automatically.

           Added in version 224.

       <u>LoaderFirmwareInfo</u>, <u>LoaderFirmwareType</u>
           Brief firmware information. Use <b><a href="../man1/bootctl.1.html">bootctl</a></b>(1) to view this data.

           Added in version 250.

       <u>LoaderImageIdentifier</u>
           The file system path to the EFI executable of the boot loader for the current boot, relative to the
           partition's root directory (i.e. relative to the partition indicated by <u>LoaderDevicePartUUID</u>, see
           above). If not set yet, this will be set to the file system path of the EFI executable of the booted
           unified kernel, in order to support systems that directly boot into a unified kernel image, bypassing
           any boot loader. Use <b><a href="../man1/bootctl.1.html">bootctl</a></b>(1) to view this data.

           Added in version 237.

       <u>StubDevicePartUUID</u>, <u>StubImageIdentifier</u>
           Similar to <u>LoaderDevicePartUUID</u> and <u>LoaderImageIdentifier</u>, but indicates the location of the unified
           kernel image EFI binary rather than the location of the boot loader binary, regardless if booted via
           a boot loader or not.

           Added in version 257.

       <u>StubInfo</u>
           Brief stub information. Use <b><a href="../man1/bootctl.1.html">bootctl</a></b>(1) to view this data.

           Added in version 250.

       <u>StubPcrKernelImage</u>
           The PCR register index the kernel image, initrd image, boot splash, devicetree database, and the
           embedded command line are measured into, formatted as decimal ASCII string (e.g.  "11"). This
           variable is set if a measurement was successfully completed, and remains unset otherwise.

           Added in version 252.

       <u>StubPcrKernelParameters</u>
           The PCR register index the kernel command line and credentials are measured into, formatted as
           decimal ASCII string (e.g.  "12"). This variable is set if a measurement was successfully completed,
           and remains unset otherwise.

           Added in version 252.

       <u>StubPcrInitRDSysExts</u>
           The PCR register index the system extensions for the initrd, which are picked up from the file system
           the kernel image is located on. Formatted as decimal ASCII string (e.g.  "13"). This variable is set
           if a measurement was successfully completed, and remains unset otherwise.

           Added in version 252.

       <u>StubPcrInitRDConfExts</u>
           The PCR register index the configuration extensions for the initrd, which are picked up from the file
           system the kernel image is located on. Formatted as decimal ASCII string (e.g.  "12"). This variable
           is set if a measurement was successfully completed, and remains unset otherwise.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>StubProfile</u>
           The numeric index of the selected profile, without the "@", formatted as decimal string. Set both on
           single-profile and multi-profile UKIs. (In the former case this variable will be set to "0"
           unconditionally.)

           Added in version 257.

       Note that some of the variables above may also be set by the boot loader. The stub will only set them if
       they are not set already. Some of these variables are defined by the <b>Boot</b> <b>Loader</b> <b>Interface</b>[5].

</pre><h4><b>INITRD</b> <b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       The following resources are passed as initrd cpio archives to the booted kernel, and thus make up the
       initial file system hierarchy in the initrd execution environment:

       /
           The main initrd from the ".initrd" PE section of the unified kernel image.

           Added in version 252.

       /.extra/credentials/*.cred
           Credential files (suffix ".cred") that are placed next to the unified kernel image (as described
           above) are copied into the /.extra/credentials/ directory in the initrd execution environment.

           Added in version 252.

       /.extra/global_credentials/*.cred
           Similarly, credential files in the /loader/credentials/ directory in the file system the unified
           kernel image is placed in are copied into the /.extra/global_credentials/ directory in the initrd
           execution environment.

           Added in version 252.

       /.extra/sysext/*.sysext.raw
           System extension image files (suffix ".sysext.raw") that are placed next to the unified kernel image
           (as described above) are copied into the /.extra/sysext/ directory in the initrd execution
           environment.

           Added in version 252.

       /.extra/confext/*.confext.raw
           Configuration extension image files (suffix ".confext.raw") that are placed next to the unified
           kernel image (as described above) are copied into the /.extra/confext/ directory in the initrd
           execution environment.

           Added in version 255.

       /.extra/tpm2-pcr-signature.json
           The TPM2 PCR signature JSON object included in the ".pcrsig" PE section of the unified kernel image
           is copied into the /.extra/tpm2-pcr-signature.json file in the initrd execution environment.

           Added in version 252.

       /.extra/tpm2-pcr-public-key.pem
           The PEM public key included in the ".pcrpkey" PE section of the unified kernel image is copied into
           the /.extra/tpm2-pcr-public-key.pem file in the initrd execution environment.

           Added in version 252.

       /.extra/profile, /.extra/os-release
           The contents of the ".profile" and ".osrel" sections of the selected profile, if any.

           Added in version 257.

       Note that all these files are located in the "tmpfs" file system the kernel sets up for the initrd file
       hierarchy and are thus lost when the system transitions from the initrd execution environment into the
       host file system. If these resources shall be kept around over this transition they need to be copied to
       a place that survives the transition first, for example via a suitable <b><a href="../man5/tmpfiles.d.5.html">tmpfiles.d</a></b>(5) line. By default,
       this is done for the TPM2 PCR signature and public key files.

</pre><h4><b>SMBIOS</b> <b>TYPE</b> <b>11</b> <b>STRINGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>systemd-stub</b> can be configured using SMBIOS Type 11 strings. Applicable strings consist of a name,
       followed by "=", followed by the value. Unless <b>systemd-stub</b> detects it is running inside a confidential
       computing environment, <b>systemd-stub</b> will search the table for a string with a specific name, and if
       found, use its value. The following strings are read:

       <u>io.systemd.stub.kernel-cmdline-extra</u>
           If set, the value of this string is added to the list of kernel command line arguments that are
           measured in PCR12 and passed to the kernel.

           Added in version 254.

</pre><h4><b>ASSEMBLING</b> <b>KERNEL</b> <b>IMAGES</b></h4><pre>
