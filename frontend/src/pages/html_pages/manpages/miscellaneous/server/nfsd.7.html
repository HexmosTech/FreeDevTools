</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nfsd - special filesystem for controlling Linux NFS server

</pre><h4><b>SYNPOSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mount</b> <b>-t</b> <b>nfsd</b> <b>nfsd</b> <b><a href="file:/proc/fs/nfsd">/proc/fs/nfsd</a></b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>nfsd</b>  filesystem  is a special filesystem which provides access to the Linux NFS server.  Writing to
       files in this filesystem can affect the server.  Reading from them  can  provide  information  about  the
       server.

       As well as this filesystem, there are a collection of files in the <b>procfs</b> filesystem (normally mounted at
       <b><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></b>) which are used to control the NFS server.  This manual page describes all of these files.

       The  <u>exportfs</u>  and <u>mountd</u> programs (part of the nfs-utils package) expect to find this filesystem mounted
       at <b><a href="file:/proc/fs/nfsd">/proc/fs/nfsd</a></b> or <b>/proc/fs/nfs</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       Files in the <b>nfsd</b> filesystem include:

       <b>exports</b>
              This file contains a list of filesystems  that  are  currently  exported  and  clients  that  each
              filesystem is exported to, together with a list of export options for that client/filesystem pair.
              This  is similar to the <b>/proc/fs/nfs/exports</b> file in 2.4.  One difference is that a client doesn't
              necessarily correspond to just one host.  It can respond to a large collection of hosts  that  are
              being treated identically.

              Each line of the file contains a path name, a client name, and a number of options in parentheses.
              Any  space,  tab, newline or back-slash character in the path name or client name will be replaced
              by a backslash followed by the octal ASCII code for that character.

       <b>threads</b>
              This file represents the number of <b>nfsd</b> thread currently running.  Reading it will show the number
              of threads.  Writing an ASCII decimal number will cause  the  number  of  threads  to  be  changed
              (increased or decreased as necessary) to achieve that number.

       <b>filehandle</b>
              This  is a somewhat unusual file  in that what is read from it depends on what was just written to
              it.  It provides a transactional interface where a program can open the file, write a request, and
              read a response.  If two separate programs open, write, and read at the same time, their  requests
              will not be mixed up.

              The  request  written  to  <b>filehandle</b> should be a client name, a path name, and a number of bytes.
              This should be followed by a newline, with white-space separating the fields, and octal quoting of
              special characters.

              On writing this, the program will be able to read back a filehandle for that path as  exported  to
              the given client.  The filehandle's length will be at most the number of bytes given.

              The filehandle will be represented in hex with a leading '\x'.

       <b>clients/</b>
              This  directory  contains a subdirectory for each NFSv4 client.  Each file under that subdirectory
              gives some details about the client in YAML format.  In addition, writing "expire\n"  to  the  <b>ctl</b>
              file will force the server to immediately revoke all state held by that client.

       The  directory  <b>/proc/net/rpc</b>  in  the <b>procfs</b> filesystem contains a number of files and directories.  The
       files contain statistics that can  be  display  using  the  <u>nfsstat</u>  program.   The  directories  contain
       information  about  various caches that the NFS server maintains to keep track of access permissions that
       different clients have for different filesystems.  The caches are:

       <b>auth.unix.ip</b>
              This cache contains a mapping from IP address to the name of the authentication  domain  that  the
              ipaddress should be treated as part of.

       <b>nfsd.export</b>
              This cache contains a mapping from directory and domain to export options.

       <b>nfsd.fh</b>
              This  cache  contains  a  mapping  from  domain  and a filesystem identifier to a directory.   The
              filesystem identifier is stored in the filehandles and consists of a number indicating the type of
              identifier and a number of hex bytes indicating the content of the identifier.

       Each directory representing a cache can hold from 1 to 3 files.  They are:

       <b>flush</b>  When a number of seconds since epoch (1 Jan 1970) is written to this  file,  all  entries  in  the
              cache that were last updated before that file become invalidated and will be flushed out.  Writing
              a  time  in the future (in seconds since epoch) will flush everything.  This is the only file that
              will always be present.

       <b>content</b>
              This file, if present, contains a textual representation of ever entry in the cache, one per line.
              If an entry is still in the cache (because it is actively  being  used)  but  has  expired  or  is
              otherwise invalid, it will be presented as a comment (with a leading hash character).

       <b>channel</b>
              This file, if present, acts a channel for request from the kernel-based nfs server to be passed to
              a user-space program for handling.

              When  the  kernel  needs  some information which isn't in the cache, it makes a line appear in the
              <b>channel</b> file giving the key for the information.  A user-space program should read this, find  the
              answer,  and  write  a  line containing the key, an expiry time, and the content.  For example the
              kernel might make
                   nfsd 127.0.0.1
              appear in the <b>auth.unix.ip/content</b> file.  The user-space program might then write
                   nfsd 127.0.0.1 1057206953 localhost
              to indicate that 127.0.0.1 should map to localhost, at least for now.

              If the program uses <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a>(2) or <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</a>(2) to discover if it can read from the <b>channel</b> then it  will
              never  see  and  end-of-file but when all requests have been answered, it will block until another
              request appears.

       In the <b><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></b> filesystem there are 4 files that can be used to enabled extra tracing of nfsd  and  related
       code.  They are:
            <b>/proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs_debug</b>
            <b>/proc/sys/sunrpc/nfsd_debug</b>
            <b>/proc/sys/sunrpc/nlm_debug</b>
            <b>/proc/sys/sunrpc/rpc_debug</b>
       They  control  tracing  for  the  NFS  client,  the  NFS server, the Network Lock Manager (lockd) and the
       underlying RPC layer respectively.  Decimal numbers can be read from or written  to  these  files.   Each
       number  represents  a bit-pattern where bits that are set cause certain classes of tracing to be enabled.
       Consult the kernel header files to find out what number correspond to what tracing.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This file system is only available in Linux 2.6 and later series kernels (and in the later parts  of  the
       2.5 development series leading up to 2.6).  This man page does not apply to 2.4 and earlier.

       Previously  the  nfsctl  systemcall  was  used  for  communication between nfsd and user utilities.  That
       systemcall was removed in kernel version 3.1.  Older nfs-utils versions were able to fall back to  nfsctl
       if necessary; that was removed from nfs-utils 1.3.5.
