</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       buildbot-worker - worker instances creation, upgrade and management

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Buildbot  worker instances are located under individual folders in <u>/var/lib/buildbot/workers</u>. This manual
       explains how to manage them.

</pre><h4><b>CREATION</b></h4><pre>
       To create a new Buildbot worker instance named <u>$NAME</u>, use the following commands:

           buildbot-worker create-worker \
                /var/lib/buildbot/workers/$NAME &lt;master&gt; &lt;name&gt; &lt;passwd&gt;
           chown -R buildbot: /var/lib/buildbot/workers/$NAME

       After which you may start the worker instance. Depending on  the  init  system  you  use,  this  is  done
       differently.

   <b>systemd</b>
       To start the instance:

           systemctl start buildbot-worker@$NAME.service

       To enable automatic start on boot:

           systemctl enable buildbot-worker@$NAME.service

       If you want to tune the way the instance is started (e.g., to change the user that runs the process), you
       may use a systemd drop-in:

           mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/buildbot-worker@$NAME.service.d
           editor /etc/systemd/system/buildbot-worker@$NAME.service.d/user.conf

       With the following contents:

           [Service]
           User=my-user
           Group=my-group

   <b>sysvinit</b>
       First,  you  need  to edit <u>/etc/default/buildbot-worker</u> and configure your instance. The syntax is pretty
       self explanatory, but here is an example:

           # 1-enabled, 0-disabled
           WORKER_ENABLED[1]=1
           # short name printed on start/stop
           WORKER_NAME[1]="$NAME"
           # user to run worker as
           WORKER_USER[1]="buildbot"
           # basedir to worker (absolute path)
           WORKER_BASEDIR[1]="/var/lib/buildbot/workers/$NAME"
           # buildbot-worker options
           WORKER_OPTIONS[1]=""
           # prefix command, i.e. nice, linux32, dchroot
           WORKER_PREFIXCMD[1]=""

       After which, you may start the instance:

           service buildbot-worker start $NAME

       By default, it will automatically start on boot.

</pre><h4><b>UPGRADE</b></h4><pre>
       When installing new versions, each worker instance is automatically restarted. No  additional  action  is
       required.

   <b>upgrade</b> <b>from</b> <b>0.8.x</b>
       Since  version  0.9.0  of  Buildbot  "slave"-based  terminology  is deprecated in favor of "worker"-based
       terminology.

       If you are upgrading from a 0.8.x version, all old buildbot-slave instances  in  <u>/var/lib/buildbot/slaves</u>
       must  be  manually  migrated.  The  simplest way of doing that is to create new workers re-using the same
       <u>&lt;master&gt;</u>, <u>&lt;name&gt;</u> and <u>&lt;passwd&gt;</u> arguments. See the <b>CREATION</b> section of this manual for more details.

       Once migrated, you may safely delete the old "slave" directory:

           rm -rf /var/lib/buildbot/slaves/$NAME

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/var/lib/buildbot/workers/$NAME</u>
           Working directory for the <u>$NAME</u> Buildbot worker instance.

       <u>/etc/systemd/system/buildbot-worker@$NAME.service.d</u>
           Directory containing customization drop-ins for the <u>$NAME</u> Buildbot worker instance service.

       <u>/etc/default/buildbot-worker</u>
           The worker instances services definition for sysvinit users.
