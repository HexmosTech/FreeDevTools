</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       arp - Linux ARP kernel module.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This kernel protocol module implements the Address Resolution Protocol defined in RFC 826.  It is used to
       convert  between  Layer2  hardware  addresses and IPv4 protocol addresses on directly connected networks.
       The user normally doesn't interact directly with this module except to configure it; instead it  provides
       a service for other protocols in the kernel.

       A  user  process  can  receive  ARP  packets  by  using <b><a href="../man7/packet.7.html">packet</a></b>(7) sockets.  There is also a mechanism for
       managing the ARP cache in user-space by using <b><a href="../man7/netlink.7.html">netlink</a></b>(7) sockets.  The ARP table can also  be  controlled
       via <b><a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</a></b>(2) on any <b>AF_INET</b> socket.

       The  ARP  module  maintains  a  cache of mappings between hardware addresses and protocol addresses.  The
       cache has a limited size so old and less frequently used entries are  garbage-collected.   Entries  which
       are  marked  as  permanent  are  never  deleted  by  the  garbage-collector.   The  cache can be directly
       manipulated by the use of ioctls and its behavior can be tuned by the <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u> interfaces described below.

       When there is no positive feedback for an existing mapping after some  time  (see  the  <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u>  interfaces
       below), a neighbor cache entry is considered stale.  Positive feedback can be gotten from a higher layer;
       for example from a successful TCP ACK.  Other protocols can signal forward progress using the <b>MSG_CONFIRM</b>
       flag  to  <b><a href="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg</a></b>(2).   When there is no forward progress, ARP tries to reprobe.  It first tries to ask a
       local arp daemon <b>app_solicit</b> times for an updated MAC address.  If that fails and an old MAC  address  is
       known,  a  unicast  probe  is  sent  <b>ucast_solicit</b> times.  If that fails too, it will broadcast a new ARP
       request to the network.  Requests are sent only when there is data queued for sending.

       Linux will automatically add a nonpermanent proxy arp entry when it receives a request for an address  it
       forwards  to  and  proxy arp is enabled on the receiving interface.  When there is a reject route for the
       target, no proxy arp entry is added.

   <b>Ioctls</b>
       Three ioctls are available on all <b>AF_INET</b> sockets.  They take a pointer  to  a  <u>struct</u>  <u>arpreq</u>  as  their
       argument.

           struct arpreq {
               struct sockaddr arp_pa;      /* protocol address */
               struct sockaddr arp_ha;      /* hardware address */
               int             arp_flags;   /* flags */
               struct sockaddr arp_netmask; /* netmask of protocol address */
               char            arp_dev[16];
           };

       <b>SIOCSARP</b>,  <b>SIOCDARP</b>  and <b>SIOCGARP</b> respectively set, delete, and get an ARP mapping.  Setting and deleting
       ARP maps are privileged operations and may  be  performed  only  by  a  process  with  the  <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>
       capability or an effective UID of 0.

       <u>arp_pa</u>  must be an <b>AF_INET</b> address and <u>arp_ha</u> must have the same type as the device which is specified in
       <u>arp_dev</u>.  <u>arp_dev</u> is a zero-terminated string which names a device.

       If the <b>ATF_NETMASK</b> flag is set, then <u>arp_netmask</u> should be valid.   Linux  2.2  does  not  support  proxy
       network  ARP  entries,  so  this should be set to 0xffffffff, or 0 to remove an existing proxy arp entry.
       <b>ATF_USETRAILERS</b> is obsolete and should not be used.

   <b><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></b> <b>interfaces</b>
       ARP supports a range of <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u> interfaces to configure parameters on a global or per-interface basis.  The
       interfaces can be accessed by reading or writing the <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/">/proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/</a>*/*</u> files.  Each  interface
       in the system has its own directory in <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/">/proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/</a></u>.  The setting in the "default" directory
       is used for all newly created devices.  Unless otherwise specified, time-related interfaces are specified
       in seconds.

       <u>anycast_delay</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              The  maximum  number  of jiffies to delay before replying to a IPv6 neighbor solicitation message.
              Anycast support is not yet implemented.  Defaults to 1 second.

       <u>app_solicit</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              The maximum number of probes to send to the user space ARP daemon via netlink before dropping back
              to multicast probes (see <u>mcast_solicit</u>).  Defaults to 0.

       <u>base_reachable_time</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              Once a neighbor has been found, the entry is considered to be valid for at least  a  random  value
              between  <u>base_reachable_time</u>/2  and 3*<u>base_reachable_time</u>/2.  An entry's validity will be extended
              if it receives positive feedback from higher level protocols.  Defaults to 30 seconds.  This  file
              is now obsolete in favor of <u>base_reachable_time_ms</u>.

       <u>base_reachable_time_ms</u> (since Linux 2.6.12)
              As for <u>base_reachable_time</u>, but measures time in milliseconds.  Defaults to 30000 milliseconds.

       <u>delay_first_probe_time</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              Delay  before  first  probe  after  it  has  been decided that a neighbor is stale.  Defaults to 5
              seconds.

       <u>gc_interval</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              How frequently the garbage collector for neighbor entries should attempt to run.  Defaults  to  30
              seconds.

       <u>gc_stale_time</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              Determines  how  often  to  check for stale neighbor entries.  When a neighbor entry is considered
              stale, it is resolved again before sending data to it.  Defaults to 60 seconds.

       <u>gc_thresh1</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              The minimum number of entries to keep in the ARP cache.  The garbage collector  will  not  run  if
              there are fewer than this number of entries in the cache.  Defaults to 128.

       <u>gc_thresh2</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              The soft maximum number of entries to keep in the ARP cache.  The garbage collector will allow the
              number  of  entries to exceed this for 5 seconds before collection will be performed.  Defaults to
              512.

       <u>gc_thresh3</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              The hard maximum number of entries to keep in the ARP cache.  The garbage  collector  will  always
              run if there are more than this number of entries in the cache.  Defaults to 1024.

       <u>locktime</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              The  minimum  number  of  jiffies  to  keep  an  ARP  entry in the cache.  This prevents ARP cache
              thrashing if there is more than one potential mapping (generally due to network misconfiguration).
              Defaults to 1 second.

       <u>mcast_solicit</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              The maximum number of attempts to resolve an address by  multicast/broadcast  before  marking  the
              entry as unreachable.  Defaults to 3.

       <u>proxy_delay</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              When  an  ARP  request  for a known proxy-ARP address is received, delay up to <u>proxy_delay</u> jiffies
              before replying.  This is used to prevent  network  flooding  in  some  cases.   Defaults  to  0.8
              seconds.

       <u>proxy_qlen</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              The maximum number of packets which may be queued to proxy-ARP addresses.  Defaults to 64.

       <u>retrans_time</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              The  number of jiffies to delay before retransmitting a request.  Defaults to 1 second.  This file
              is now obsolete in favor of <u>retrans_time_ms</u>.

       <u>retrans_time_ms</u> (since Linux 2.6.12)
              The  number  of  milliseconds  to  delay  before  retransmitting  a  request.   Defaults  to  1000
              milliseconds.

       <u>ucast_solicit</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              The  maximum  number  of  attempts  to  send  unicast  probes  before  asking  the ARP daemon (see
              <u>app_solicit</u>).  Defaults to 3.

       <u>unres_qlen</u> (since Linux 2.2)
              The maximum number of packets which may be queued for each unresolved  address  by  other  network
              layers.  Defaults to 3.

</pre><h4><b>VERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>struct</u> <u>arpreq</u> changed in Linux 2.0 to include the <u>arp_dev</u> member and the ioctl numbers changed at the
       same time.  Support for the old ioctls was dropped in Linux 2.2.

       Support  for  proxy arp entries for networks (netmask not equal 0xffffffff) was dropped in Linux 2.2.  It
       is replaced by automatic proxy arp setup by the kernel for all reachable hosts on other interfaces  (when
       forwarding and proxy arp is enabled for the interface).

       The <u>neigh/*</u> interfaces did not exist before Linux 2.2.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Some  timer  settings  are specified in jiffies, which is architecture- and kernel version-dependent; see
       <b><a href="../man7/time.7.html">time</a></b>(7).

       There is no way to signal positive feedback from user space.  This  means  connection-oriented  protocols
       implemented  in  user space will generate excessive ARP traffic, because ndisc will regularly reprobe the
       MAC address.  The same problem applies for some kernel protocols (e.g., NFS over UDP).

       This man page mashes together functionality that is  IPv4-specific  with  functionality  that  is  shared
       between IPv4 and IPv6.
