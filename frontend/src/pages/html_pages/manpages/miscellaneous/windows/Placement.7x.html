</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Placement</b> - AfterStep supports several different window placement policies. Some of them designed to fill
       free space, and some allowing for windows to be placed on top of others.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Cascade

              Windows will be placed in cascading order.

       Manual

              Windows must be placed manually.

       RandomPlacement

              Windows  will be placed randomply, in space unobstructed by windows that have AvoidCover attribute
              set.

       SmartPlacement

              Most suitable free space area will be chosen to place window in. If  no  such  area  is  found  of
              sufficient  size  -  window  will be placed using secondary placement strategy, or manually, if no
              secondary strategy is specified.

       Tile

              Windows will be tiled in free space. If no  space  of  suitable  size  is  found,  then  secondary
              placement  strategy  is  engaged,  or  window  will have to be placed manually. This is similar to
              SmartPlacement,  except  that  suitable  space  is  chosen  following   direction   left-to-right,
              top-to-bottom,  instead of looking for space, most fitting the window size (the way SmartPlacement
              works).
