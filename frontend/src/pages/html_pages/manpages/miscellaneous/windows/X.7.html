</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       X - a portable, network-transparent window system

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       The  X  Window  System is a network transparent window system which runs on a wide range of computing and
       graphics machines.  It should be relatively  straightforward  to  build  the  X.Org  Foundation  software
       distribution  on  most ANSI C and POSIX compliant systems.  Commercial implementations are also available
       for a wide range of platforms.

       The X.Org Foundation requests that the following names be used when referring to this software:

                                              X
                                              X Window System
                                              X Version 11
                                              X Window System, Version 11
                                              X11

       <u>X</u> <u>Window</u> <u>System</u> is a trademark of The Open Group.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       X Window System servers run on computers with bitmap displays.  The server distributes user input to  and
       accepts  output  requests  from  various  client  programs  through  a  variety of different interprocess
       communication channels.  Although the most common case is for the client programs to be  running  on  the
       same machine as the server, clients can be run transparently from other machines (including machines with
       different architectures and operating systems) as well.

       X  supports  overlapping hierarchical subwindows and text and graphics operations, on both monochrome and
       color displays.  For a full explanation of the functions that are available, see the <u>Xlib</u> <u>–</u> <u>C</u> <u>Language</u>  <u>X</u>
       <u>Interface</u>  manual,  the  <u>X</u>  <u>Window</u>  <u>System</u>  <u>Protocol</u> specification, the <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> <u>Intrinsics</u> <u>–</u> <u>C</u> <u>Language</u>
       <u>Interface</u> manual, and various toolkit documents.  Those manuals, specifications, &amp; documents may be found
       in <a href="file:/usr/share/doc">/usr/share/doc</a> or on the X.Org Foundation website at https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/.

       The number of programs that use <u>X</u> is quite large.  Sample  programs  provided  by  the  X.Org  Foundation
       include:  a  terminal  emulator, <u>xterm</u>; a window manager, <u>twm</u>; a compositing manager, <u>xcompmgr</u>; a display
       manager, <u>xdm</u>; a console redirect program, <u>xconsole</u>; utilities for  managing  input  and  output  devices,
       <u>xinput</u>  and <u>xrandr</u>; resource listing/manipulation tools, <u>appres</u>, <u>editres</u>; access control programs, <u>xauth</u>,
       <u>xhost</u>, and <u>iceauth</u>; user preference setting programs, <u>transset</u>, <u>xrdb</u>, <u>xcmsdb</u>, <u>xset</u>,  <u>xsetroot</u>,  <u>xstdcmap</u>,
       and  <u>xmodmap</u>;  clocks, <u>xclock</u> and <u>oclock</u>; font display utilities, <u>xfd</u> and <u>xfontsel</u>; utilities for listing
       information about displays, extensions, and resources, <u>xdpyinfo</u>, <u>xdriinfo</u>, <u>xvinfo</u>, <u>xwininfo</u>,  <u>xlsclients</u>,
       <u>xprop</u>,  <u>xlsatoms</u>,  <u>xlsclients</u>,  and <u>xlsfonts</u>; screen image manipulation utilities, <u>xwd</u>, <u>xwud</u>, and <u>xmag</u>; a
       performance measurement utility, <u>x11perf</u>; a font compiler, <u>bdftopcf</u>; a font server and related utilities,
       <u>xfs</u>, <u>xfsinfo</u>, <u>fslsfonts</u>, <u>fstobdf</u>; a display server and related  utilities,  <u>Xserver</u>,  <u>rgb</u>,  <u>mkfontdir</u>;  a
       clipboard  manager,  <u>xclipboard</u>;  keyboard description compiler and related utilities, <u>xkbcomp</u>, <u>setxkbmap</u>
       <u>xkbprint</u>, <u>xkbbell</u>, <u>xkbevd</u>, <u>xkbvleds</u>, and <u>xkbwatch</u>; a utility to terminate clients, <u>xkill</u>; and  a  utility
       to cause part or all of the screen to be redrawn, <u>xrefresh</u>.

       Many  other  utilities, window managers, games, toolkits, etc. are included as packages in many operating
       system distributions, or are available on the Internet.  See your site administrator  or  distro  package
       manager for details.

</pre><h4><b>STARTING</b> <b>UP</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  two main ways of getting the X server and an initial set of client applications started.  The
       particular method used depends on what operating system you are running and whether or not you use  other
       window systems in addition to X.

       <b>Display</b> <b>Manager</b>
               If  you  want  to  always  have  X  running on your display, your site administrator can set your
               machine up to use a Display Manager such as <u>xdm</u>, <u>gdm</u>, or <u>kdm</u>.  This program is typically  started
               by  the system at boot time and takes care of keeping the server running and getting users logged
               in.  If you are running one of these display managers, you will normally  see  a  window  on  the
               screen welcoming you to the system and asking for your login information.  Simply type them in as
               you would at a normal terminal.  If you make a mistake, the display manager will display an error
               message  and  ask  you  to try again.  After you have successfully logged in, the display manager
               will start up your X environment.  The documentation for the display manager you use can  provide
               more details.

       <u>xinit</u> <b>(run</b> <b>manually</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell)</b>
               Sites that support more than one window system might choose to use the <u>xinit</u> program for starting
               X  manually.   If  this  is  true  for  your  machine, your site administrator will probably have
               provided a program named "x11", "startx", or "xstart" that will do  site-specific  initialization
               (such  as loading convenient default resources, running a window manager, displaying a clock, and
               starting several terminal emulators) in a nice way.  If not, you can build such  a  script  using
               the <u>xinit</u> program.  This utility simply runs one user-specified program to start the server, runs
               another  to  start  up any desired clients, and then waits for either to finish.  Since either or
               both of the user-specified programs may be a shell script, this gives substantial flexibility  at
               the expense of a nice interface.  For this reason, <u>xinit</u> is not intended for end users.

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAY</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       From the user's perspective, every X server has a <u>display</u> <u>name</u> of the form:

              <u>hostname:displaynumber.screennumber</u>
       or
              <u>protocol/hostname:displaynumber.screennumber</u>

       This  information  is  used by the application to determine how it should connect to the server and which
       screen it should use by default (on displays with multiple monitors):

       <u>protocol</u>
               The <u>protocol</u> specifies the protocol to  use  for  communication.   Exactly  which  protocols  are
               supported is platform dependent, but most commonly supported ones are:
               tcp     TCP over IPv4 or IPv6
               inet    TCP over IPv4 only
               inet6   TCP over IPv6 only
               unix    UNIX Domain Sockets (same host only)
               local   Platform preferred local connection method
               If the protocol is not specified, Xlib uses whatever it believes is the most efficient transport.

       <u>hostname</u>
               The  <u>hostname</u> specifies the name of the machine to which the display is physically connected.  If
               the hostname is not given, a connection to a server on the same machine will be used.

       <u>displaynumber</u>
               The phrase "display" is usually used to refer to a collection of monitors that share a common set
               of input devices (keyboard, mouse, tablet, etc.).   Most  workstations  tend  to  only  have  one
               display.  Larger, multi-user systems, however, frequently have several displays so that more than
               one  person can be doing graphics work at once.  To avoid confusion, each display on a machine is
               assigned a <u>display</u> <u>number</u> (beginning at 0) when the X server for that display  is  started.   The
               display number must always be given in a display name.

       <u>screennumber</u>
               Some displays share their input devices among two or more monitors.  These may be configured as a
               single  logical  screen,  which  allows windows to move across screens, or as individual screens,
               each with their own set of windows.  If configured such that each monitor  has  its  own  set  of
               windows,  each  screen  is  assigned  a <u>screen</u> <u>number</u> (beginning at 0) when the X server for that
               display is started.  If the screen number is not given, screen 0 will be used.

       On POSIX systems, the default display name is stored in your DISPLAY environment variable.  This variable
       is set automatically by the <u>xterm</u> terminal emulator.  However, when you log into  another  machine  on  a
       network, you may need to set DISPLAY by hand to point to your display.  For example,

           % setenv DISPLAY myws:0
           $ DISPLAY=myws:0; export DISPLAY

       The  <u>ssh</u> program can be used to start an X program on a remote machine; it automatically sets the DISPLAY
       variable correctly.

       Finally, most X programs accept a command line option of <b>-display</b> <u>displayname</u> to temporarily override the
       contents of DISPLAY.  This is most commonly used to pop windows on another person's screen or as part  of
       a "remote shell" command to start an xterm pointing back to your display.  For example,

           % xeyes -display joesws:0 -geometry 1000x1000+0+0
           % rsh big xterm -display myws:0 -ls &lt;/dev/null &amp;

       X servers listen for connections on a variety of different communications channels (network byte streams,
       shared  memory,  etc.).   Since there can be more than one way of contacting a given server, The <u>hostname</u>
       part of the display name is used to determine the type of channel (also called a transport layer)  to  be
       used.  X servers generally support the following types of connections:

       <u>local</u>
               The  hostname  part  of  the  display name should be the empty string.  For example:  <u>:0</u>, <u>:1</u>, and
               <u>:0.1</u>.  The most efficient local transport will be chosen.

       <u>TCP/IP</u>
               The hostname part of the display name should be the server  machine's  hostname  or  IP  address.
               Full  Internet names, abbreviated names, IPv4 addresses, and IPv6 addresses are all allowed.  For
               example: <u>x.org:0</u>, <u>expo:0</u>, <u>[::1]:0</u>, <u>198.112.45.11:0</u>, <u>bigmachine:1</u>, and <u>hydra:0.1</u>.

</pre><h4><b>LOCAL</b> <b>CONNECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       For operating systems that support local connections other than Unix  Domain  sockets  (SVR3  and  SVR4),
       there  is  a  compiled-in list specifying the order in which local connections should be attempted.  This
       list can be overridden by the <u>XLOCAL</u> environment variable described below.  If the display name indicates
       a best-choice connection should be made  (e.g.   <b>:0.0</b>),  each  connection  mechanism  is  tried  until  a
       connection succeeds or no more mechanisms are available.

       The <u>XLOCAL</u> environment variable should contain a list of one more more of the following:

               NAMED
               PTS
               SCO
               UNIX

       which  represent  SVR4  Named Streams pipe, Old-style USL Streams pipe, SCO XSight Streams pipe, and Unix
       domain sockets, respectively.  You can select a single mechanism (e.g.  <u>XLOCAL=NAMED</u>), or an ordered list
       (e.g. <u>XLOCAL="NAMED:PTS:SCO"</u>).  This variable  overrides  the  compiled-in  defaults.   For  SVR4  it  is
       recommended that <u>NAMED</u> be the first preference connection.  The default setting is platform-dependent.

       To  globally  override the compiled-in defaults, you should define (and export if using <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b>) <u>XLOCAL</u>
       globally.  If you use <a href="../man1/startx.1.html">startx</a>(1) or <a href="../man1/xinit.1.html">xinit</a>(1), the definition should be at the top of your  <u>.xinitrc</u>  file.
       If you use <a href="../man1/xdm.1.html">xdm</a>(1), the definitions should be early on in the <u>/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession</u> script.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       An X server can use several types of access control.  Mechanisms provided in Release 7 are:
       Host Access           Simple host-based access control.
       MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1    Shared plain-text "cookies".
       XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1   Secure DES based private-keys.
       SUN-DES-1             Based on Sun's secure rpc system.
       Server Interpreted    Server-dependent methods of access control

       <u>Xdm</u>  initializes  access  control  for  the  server  and  also places authorization information in a file
       accessible to the user.

       Normally, the list of hosts from which connections are always accepted should  be  empty,  so  that  only
       clients with are explicitly authorized can connect to the display.  When you add entries to the host list
       (with  <u>xhost</u>),  the  server  no longer performs any authorization on connections from those machines.  Be
       careful with this.

       The file from which <u>Xlib</u> extracts authorization data can  be  specified  with  the  environment  variable
       <b>XAUTHORITY</b>,  and  defaults to the file <b>.Xauthority</b> in the home directory.  <u>Xdm</u> uses <b>$HOME/.Xauthority</b> and
       will create it or merge in authorization records if it already exists when a user logs in.

       If you use several machines and share a common home directory across all of the machines by  means  of  a
       network  file  system,  you  never really have to worry about authorization files, the system should work
       correctly by default.  Otherwise, as the authorization files are machine-independent, you can simply copy
       the files to share them.  To manage authorization files, use <u>xauth</u>.  This program allows you  to  extract
       records and insert them into other files.  Using this, you can send authorization to remote machines when
       you  login,  if  the remote machine does not share a common home directory with your local machine.  Note
       that authorization information transmitted ``in the clear'' through a network file system or using <u>ftp</u> or
       <u>rcp</u> can be ``stolen'' by a network eavesdropper, and as such may enable  unauthorized  access.   In  many
       environments, this level of security is not a concern, but if it is, you need to know the exact semantics
       of the particular authorization data to know if this is actually a problem.

       For more information on access control, see the <u><a href="../man7/Xsecurity.7.html">Xsecurity</a></u>(7) manual page.

</pre><h4><b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       One  of  the advantages of using window systems instead of hardwired terminals is that applications don't
       have to be restricted to a particular size or location on the screen.  Although the layout of windows  on
       a display is controlled by the window manager that the user is running (described below), most X programs
       accept  a  command line argument of the form <b>-geometry</b> <u>WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFF+YOFF</u> (where <u>WIDTH</u>, <u>HEIGHT</u>, <u>XOFF</u>,
       and <u>YOFF</u> are numbers) for specifying a preferred size and location for this application's main window.

       The <u>WIDTH</u> and <u>HEIGHT</u> parts of the geometry  specification  are  usually  measured  in  either  pixels  or
       characters, depending on the application.  The <u>XOFF</u> and <u>YOFF</u> parts are measured in pixels and are used to
       specify  the  distance  of  the  window  from  the  left or right and top and bottom edges of the screen,
       respectively.  Both types of offsets  are  measured  from  the  indicated  edge  of  the  screen  to  the
       corresponding edge of the window.  The X offset may be specified in the following ways:

       <u>+XOFF</u>   The  left  edge  of  the  window  is to be placed <u>XOFF</u> pixels in from the left edge of the screen
               (i.e., the X coordinate of the window's origin will be <u>XOFF</u>).  <u>XOFF</u> may  be  negative,  in  which
               case the window's left edge will be off the screen.

       <u>-XOFF</u>   The  right  edge  of the window is to be placed <u>XOFF</u> pixels in from the right edge of the screen.
               <u>XOFF</u> may be negative, in which case the window's right edge will be off the screen.

       The Y offset has similar meanings:

       <u>+YOFF</u>   The top edge of the window is to be <u>YOFF</u> pixels below the top edge of the  screen  (i.e.,  the  Y
               coordinate  of  the  window's  origin  will  be  <u>YOFF</u>).   <u>YOFF</u> may be negative, in which case the
               window's top edge will be off the screen.

       <u>-YOFF</u>   The bottom edge of the window is to be <u>YOFF</u> pixels above the bottom edge of the screen.  <u>YOFF</u> may
               be negative, in which case the window's bottom edge will be off the screen.

       Offsets must be given as pairs; in other words, in order to specify either <u>XOFF</u>  or  <u>YOFF</u>  both  must  be
       present.  Windows can be placed in the four corners of the screen using the following specifications:

       <u>+0+0</u>    upper left hand corner.

       <u>-0+0</u>    upper right hand corner.

       <u>-0-0</u>    lower right hand corner.

       <u>+0-0</u>    lower left hand corner.

       In  the  following examples, a terminal emulator is placed in roughly the center of the screen and a load
       average monitor, mailbox, and clock are placed in the upper right hand corner:

           xterm -fn 6x10 -geometry 80x24+30+200 &amp;
           xclock -geometry 48x48-0+0 &amp;
           xload -geometry 48x48-96+0 &amp;
           xbiff -geometry 48x48-48+0 &amp;

</pre><h4><b>WINDOW</b> <b>MANAGERS</b></h4><pre>
       The layout of windows on the screen is controlled by special programs called <u>window</u>  <u>managers</u>.   Although
       many  window  managers  will  honor  geometry  specifications  as given, others may choose to ignore them
       (requiring the user to explicitly draw the window's region on the screen with the pointer, for example).

       Since window managers are  regular  (albeit  complex)  client  programs,  a  variety  of  different  user
       interfaces  can  be  built.   The  X.Org  Foundation  provides  a window manager named <u>twm</u> which supports
       overlapping windows, popup menus, point-and-click or click-to-type input models, title bars,  nice  icons
       (and an icon manager for those who don't like separate icon windows).

       See your distro package manager for other popular window managers.

</pre><h4><b>FONT</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       Collections  of  characters  for  displaying  text and symbols in X are known as <u>fonts</u>.  A font typically
       contains images that share a common appearance and look  nice  together  (for  example,  a  single  size,
       boldness,  slant,  and  character  set).  Similarly, collections of fonts that are based on a common type
       face (the variations are usually called roman, bold, italic, bold italic, oblique, and bold oblique)  are
       called <u>families</u>.

       Fonts  come  in  various sizes.  The X server supports <u>scalable</u> fonts, meaning it is possible to create a
       font of arbitrary size from a single source for the font.  The server supports scaling from <u>outline</u> fonts
       and <u>bitmap</u> fonts.  Scaling from outline fonts usually produces significantly better results than  scaling
       from bitmap fonts.

       An  X server can obtain fonts from individual files stored in directories in the file system, or from one
       or more font servers, or from a mixtures of directories and font servers.  The list of places the  server
       looks when trying to find a font is controlled by its <u>font</u> <u>path</u>.  Although most installations will choose
       to  have  the  server  start up with all of the commonly used font directories in the font path, the font
       path can be changed at any time with the <u>xset</u> program.  However, it is important  to  remember  that  the
       directory names are on the <b>server</b>'s machine, not on the application's.

       Bitmap  font  files  are  usually created by compiling a textual font description into binary form, using
       <u>bdftopcf</u>.  Font databases are created by running the <u>mkfontdir</u> program in the  directory  containing  the
       source  or  compiled versions of the fonts.  Whenever fonts are added to a directory, <u>mkfontdir</u> should be
       rerun so that the server can find the new fonts.  To make the server reread the font database, reset  the
       font  path  with  the  <u>xset</u>  program.   For  example, to add a font to a private directory, the following
       commands could be used:

           % cp newfont.pcf <a href="file:~/myfonts">~/myfonts</a>
           % mkfontdir <a href="file:~/myfonts">~/myfonts</a>
           % xset fp rehash

       The <u>xfontsel</u> and <u>xlsfonts</u> programs can be used to browse through the fonts available on a  server.   Font
       names  tend  to  be  fairly  long  as  they  contain  all  of the information needed to uniquely identify
       individual fonts.  However, the X server supports wildcarding of font names, so the full specification

           <u>-adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--10-100-75-75-m-60-iso8859-1</u>

       might be abbreviated as:

           <u>-*-courier-medium-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1</u>

       Because the shell also has special meanings for <u>*</u> and <u>?</u>, wildcarded font names should be quoted:

           % xlsfonts -fn '-*-courier-medium-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*'

       The <u>xlsfonts</u> program can be used to list all of the fonts that match a given pattern.  With no arguments,
       it lists all available fonts.  This will usually list the same font at many different sizes.  To see just
       the base scalable font names, try using one of the following patterns:

           <u>-*-*-*-*-*-*-0-0-0-0-*-0-*-*</u>
           <u>-*-*-*-*-*-*-0-0-75-75-*-0-*-*</u>
           <u>-*-*-*-*-*-*-0-0-100-100-*-0-*-*</u>

       To convert one of the resulting names into a font at a specific size, replace one of the first two  zeros
       with  a  nonzero  value.   The  field  containing the first zero is for the pixel size; replace it with a
       specific height in pixels to name a font at that size.  Alternatively, the field  containing  the  second
       zero  is for the point size; replace it with a specific size in decipoints (there are 722.7 decipoints to
       the inch) to name a font at that size.  The last zero is an average width field, measured  in  tenths  of
       pixels; some servers will anamorphically scale if this value is specified.

</pre><h4><b>FONT</b> <b>SERVER</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       One of the following forms can be used to name a font server that accepts TCP connections:

           tcp/<u>hostname</u>:<u>port</u>
           tcp/<u>hostname</u>:<u>port</u>/<u>cataloguelist</u>

       The  <u>hostname</u>  specifies the name (or decimal numeric address) of the machine on which the font server is
       running.  The <u>port</u> is the decimal TCP port on which the font server is listening  for  connections.   The
       <u>cataloguelist</u> specifies a list of catalogue names, with '+' as a separator.

       Examples: <u>tcp/x.org:7100</u>, <u>tcp/198.112.45.11:7100/all</u>.

</pre><h4><b>COLOR</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       Most  applications  provide  ways  of tailoring (usually through resources or command line arguments) the
       colors of various elements in the text and graphics they display.  A color can be specified either by  an
       abstract  color  name, or by a numerical color specification.  The numerical specification can identify a
       color in either device-dependent (RGB) or device-independent terms.  Color strings are case-insensitive.

       X supports the use of abstract color names, for example, "red", "blue".  A value for this  abstract  name
       is  obtained by searching one or more color name databases.  <u>Xlib</u> first searches zero or more client-side
       databases; the number, location, and content of these databases is implementation dependent.  If the name
       is not found, the color is looked up in the X server's database.  The  text  form  of  this  database  is
       commonly stored in the file <u>/usr/share/X11/rgb.txt</u>.

       A  numerical  color  specification  consists  of  a color space name and a set of values in the following
       syntax:

           <u>&lt;color_space_name&gt;</u>:<u>&lt;value&gt;/.../&lt;value&gt;</u>

       An RGB Device specification is identified by the prefix "rgb:" and has the following syntax:

           rgb:<u>&lt;red&gt;/&lt;green&gt;/&lt;blue&gt;</u>

               <u>&lt;red&gt;</u>, <u>&lt;green&gt;</u>, <u>&lt;blue&gt;</u> := <u>h</u> | <u>hh</u> | <u>hhh</u> | <u>hhhh</u>
               <u>h</u> := single hexadecimal digits

       Note that <u>h</u> indicates the value scaled in 4 bits, <u>hh</u> the value scaled in 8 bits, <u>hhh</u> the value scaled  in
       12  bits,  and <u>hhhh</u> the value scaled in 16 bits, respectively.  These values are passed directly to the X
       server, and are assumed to be gamma corrected.

       The eight primary colors can be represented as:

                                             black     rgb:0/0/0
                                             red       rgb:ffff/0/0
                                             green     rgb:0/ffff/0
                                             blue      rgb:0/0/ffff
                                             yellow    rgb:ffff/ffff/0
                                             magenta   rgb:ffff/0/ffff
                                             cyan      rgb:0/ffff/ffff
                                             white     rgb:ffff/ffff/ffff

       For backward compatibility, an older syntax for RGB Device is supported, but its  continued  use  is  not
       encouraged.  The syntax is an initial sharp sign character followed by a numeric specification, in one of
       the following formats:

                                            #RGB            (4 bits each)
                                            #RRGGBB         (8 bits each)
                                            #RRRGGGBBB      (12 bits each)
                                            #RRRRGGGGBBBB   (16 bits each)

       The  R,  G,  and B represent single hexadecimal digits.  When fewer than 16 bits each are specified, they
       represent the most-significant bits of the value (unlike the "rgb:" syntax, in which values are  scaled).
       For example, #3a7 is the same as #3000a0007000.

       An RGB intensity specification is identified by the prefix "rgbi:" and has the following syntax:

           rgbi:<u>&lt;red&gt;/&lt;green&gt;/&lt;blue&gt;</u>

       The red, green, and blue are floating point values between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.  They represent linear
       intensity  values,  with 1.0 indicating full intensity, 0.5 half intensity, and so on.  These values will
       be gamma corrected by <u>Xlib</u> before being sent to the X server.  The input format for these  values  is  an
       optional  sign,  a  string of numbers possibly containing a decimal point, and an optional exponent field
       containing an E or e followed by a possibly signed integer string.

       The standard device-independent string specifications have the following syntax:

                                        CIEXYZ:<u>&lt;X&gt;/&lt;Y&gt;/&lt;Z&gt;</u>   (<u>none</u>, 1, <u>none</u>)
                                        CIEuvY:<u>&lt;u&gt;/&lt;v&gt;/&lt;Y&gt;</u>   (~.6, ~.6, 1)
                                        CIExyY:<u>&lt;x&gt;/&lt;y&gt;/&lt;Y&gt;</u>   (~.75, ~.85, 1)
                                        CIELab:<u>&lt;L&gt;/&lt;a&gt;/&lt;b&gt;</u>   (100, <u>none</u>, <u>none</u>)
                                        CIELuv:<u>&lt;L&gt;/&lt;u&gt;/&lt;v&gt;</u>   (100, <u>none</u>, <u>none</u>)
                                        TekHVC:<u>&lt;H&gt;/&lt;V&gt;/&lt;C&gt;</u>   (360, 100, 100)

       All of the values (C, H, V, X, Y, Z, a, b, u, v, y, x) are floating point values.  Some of the values are
       constrained to be between zero and some upper bound; the upper bounds are  given  in  parentheses  above.
       The  syntax  for  these  values  is an optional '+' or '-' sign, a string of digits possibly containing a
       decimal point, and an optional exponent field consisting of an 'E' or 'e' followed by an optional '+'  or
       '-' followed by a string of digits.

       For more information on device independent color, see the <u>Xlib</u> reference manual.

</pre><h4><b>KEYBOARDS</b></h4><pre>
       The  X keyboard model is broken into two layers:  server-specific codes (called <u>keycodes</u>) which represent
       the physical keys, and server-independent symbols (called <u>keysyms</u>) which represent the letters  or  words
       that appear on the keys.  Two tables are kept in the server for converting keycodes to keysyms:

       <u>modifier</u> <u>list</u>
               Some  keys  (such  as Shift, Control, and Caps Lock) are known as <u>modifier</u> and are used to select
               different symbols that are attached to a single key (such as Shift-a generates a capital  A,  and
               Control-l  generates  a control character ^L).  The server keeps a list of keycodes corresponding
               to the various modifier keys.  Whenever a key is pressed or released,  the  server  generates  an
               <u>event</u>  that  contains  the keycode of the indicated key as well as a mask that specifies which of
               the modifier keys are currently pressed.  Most servers set up this list to initially contain  the
               various shift, control, and shift lock keys on the keyboard.

       <u>keymap</u> <u>table</u>
               Applications  translate event keycodes and modifier masks into keysyms using a <u>keysym</u> <u>table</u> which
               contains one row for each keycode and one column for various  modifier  states.   This  table  is
               initialized by the server to correspond to normal typewriter conventions.  The exact semantics of
               how the table is interpreted to produce keysyms depends on the particular program, libraries, and
               language  input method used, but the following conventions for the first four keysyms in each row
               are generally adhered to:

       The first four elements of the list are split into two groups of keysyms.  Group 1 contains the first and
       second keysyms; Group 2 contains the third and fourth keysyms.  Within each group, if the  first  element
       is  alphabetic  and  the  second  element  is  the  special keysym <u>NoSymbol</u>, then the group is treated as
       equivalent to a group in which the first element is the lowercase letter and the second  element  is  the
       uppercase letter.

       Switching  between groups is controlled by the keysym named MODE SWITCH, by attaching that keysym to some
       key and attaching that key to any one of the modifiers Mod1 through Mod5.  This modifier  is  called  the
       ``group  modifier''.   Group 1 is used when the group modifier is off, and Group 2 is used when the group
       modifier is on.

       Within a group, the modifier state determines which keysym to use.  The first keysym  is  used  when  the
       Shift and Lock modifiers are off.  The second keysym is used when the Shift modifier is on, when the Lock
       modifier  is  on  and  the  second keysym is uppercase alphabetic, or when the Lock modifier is on and is
       interpreted as ShiftLock.  Otherwise, when the Lock modifier is on and is interpreted  as  CapsLock,  the
       state  of  the  Shift  modifier  is  applied  first  to  select a keysym; but if that keysym is lowercase
       alphabetic, then the corresponding uppercase keysym is used instead.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Most X programs attempt to use the same names for command line options and arguments.   All  applications
       written with the X Toolkit Intrinsics automatically accept the following options:

       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>
               This option specifies the name of the X server to use.

       <b>-geometry</b> <u>geometry</u>
               This option specifies the initial size and location of the window.

       <b>-bg</b> <u>color</u><b>,</b> <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>
               Either option specifies the color to use for the window background.

       <b>-bd</b> <u>color</u><b>,</b> <b>-bordercolor</b> <u>color</u>
               Either option specifies the color to use for the window border.

       <b>-bw</b> <u>number</u><b>,</b> <b>-borderwidth</b> <u>number</u>
               Either option specifies the width in pixels of the window border.

       <b>-fg</b> <u>color</u><b>,</b> <b>-foreground</b> <u>color</u>
               Either option specifies the color to use for text or graphics.

       <b>-fn</b> <u>font</u><b>,</b> <b>-font</b> <u>font</u>
               Either option specifies the font to use for displaying text.

       <b>-iconic</b>
               This  option indicates that the user would prefer that the application's windows initially not be
               visible as if the windows had be immediately iconified by the user.  Window managers  may  choose
               not to honor the application's request.

       <b>-name</b>
               This  option  specifies the name under which resources for the application should be found.  This
               option is useful in shell aliases to distinguish between invocations of an  application,  without
               resorting to creating links to alter the executable file name.

       <b>-rv</b>, <b>-reverse</b>
               Either  option  indicates  that  the  program should simulate reverse video if possible, often by
               swapping the foreground and background colors.  Not all  programs  honor  this  or  implement  it
               correctly.  It is usually only used on monochrome displays.

       <b>+rv</b>
               This  option  indicates  that  the  program  should  not simulate reverse video.  This is used to
               override any defaults since reverse video doesn't always work properly.

       <b>-selectionTimeout</b>
               This option specifies the timeout in milliseconds within  which  two  communicating  applications
               must respond to one another for a selection request.

       <b>-synchronous</b>
               This  option  indicates  that  requests  to the X server should be sent synchronously, instead of
               asynchronously.  Since <u>Xlib</u> normally buffers requests to the server, errors  do  not  necessarily
               get  reported  immediately  after  they  occur.   This option turns off the buffering so that the
               application can be debugged.  It should never be used with a working program.

       <b>-title</b> <u>string</u>
               This option specifies the title to be used for this window.  This information is  sometimes  used
               by a window manager to provide some sort of header identifying the window.

       <b>-xnllanguage</b> <u>language[_territory][.codeset]</u>
               This  option  specifies  the  language,  territory, and codeset for use in resolving resource and
               other filenames.

       <b>-xrm</b> <u>resourcestring</u>
               This option specifies a resource name and value to override any defaults.  It is also very useful
               for setting resources that don't have explicit command line arguments.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       To make the tailoring of applications to personal preferences easier, X provides a mechanism for  storing
       default values for program resources (e.g. background color, window title, etc.) that is used by programs
       that  use  toolkits based on the X Toolkit Intrinsics library libXt.  (Programs using the common Gtk+ and
       Qt toolkits use other configuration mechanisms.)  Resources are specified as strings  that  are  read  in
       from  various places when an application is run.  Program components are named in a hierarchical fashion,
       with each node in the hierarchy identified by a class and an instance name.  At  the  top  level  is  the
       class  and  instance name of the application itself.  By convention, the class name of the application is
       the same as the program name, but with the first letter capitalized (e.g. <u>Bitmap</u> or <u>Emacs</u>) although  some
       programs that begin with the letter ``x'' also capitalize the second letter for historical reasons.

       The precise syntax for resources is:

       ResourceLine    =       Comment | IncludeFile | ResourceSpec | &lt;empty line&gt;
       Comment         =       "!" {&lt;any character except null or newline&gt;}
       IncludeFile     =       "#" WhiteSpace "include" WhiteSpace FileName WhiteSpace
       FileName        =       &lt;valid filename for operating system&gt;
       ResourceSpec    =       WhiteSpace ResourceName WhiteSpace ":" WhiteSpace Value
       ResourceName    =       [Binding] {Component Binding} ComponentName
       Binding         =       "." | "*"
       WhiteSpace      =       {&lt;space&gt; | &lt;horizontal tab&gt;}
       Component       =       "?" | ComponentName
       ComponentName   =       NameChar {NameChar}
       NameChar        =       "a"-"z" | "A"-"Z" | "0"-"9" | "_" | "-"
       Value           =       {&lt;any character except null or unescaped newline&gt;}

       Elements  separated  by  vertical  bar  (|) are alternatives.  Curly braces ({...}) indicate zero or more
       repetitions of the enclosed elements.  Square brackets ([...]) indicate  that  the  enclosed  element  is
       optional.  Quotes ("...") are used around literal characters.

       IncludeFile  lines  are  interpreted  by replacing the line with the contents of the specified file.  The
       word "include" must be in lowercase.  The filename is interpreted relative to the directory of  the  file
       in  which  the  line  occurs  (for  example, if the filename contains no directory or contains a relative
       directory specification).

       If a ResourceName contains a contiguous sequence of two or more Binding characters, the sequence will  be
       replaced  with  single "." character if the sequence contains only "." characters, otherwise the sequence
       will be replaced with a single "*" character.

       A resource database never contains more than one entry for a given  ResourceName.   If  a  resource  file
       contains multiple lines with the same ResourceName, the last line in the file is used.

       Any  whitespace  character  before  or after the name or colon in a ResourceSpec are ignored.  To allow a
       Value to begin with whitespace, the two-character sequence ``\<u>space</u>'' (backslash followed  by  space)  is
       recognized and replaced by a space character, and the two-character sequence ``\<u>tab</u>'' (backslash followed
       by horizontal tab) is recognized and replaced by a horizontal tab character.  To allow a Value to contain
       embedded  newline  characters,  the two-character sequence ``\n'' is recognized and replaced by a newline
       character.  To allow a Value to be broken across  multiple  lines  in  a  text  file,  the  two-character
       sequence ``\<u>newline</u>'' (backslash followed by newline) is recognized and removed from the value.  To allow
       a  Value  to  contain  arbitrary character codes, the four-character sequence ``\<u>nnn</u>'', where each <u>n</u> is a
       digit character in the range of ``0''-``7'', is recognized and replaced with a single byte that  contains
       the  octal value specified by the sequence.  Finally, the two-character sequence ``\\'' is recognized and
       replaced with a single backslash.

       When an application looks for the value of a resource, it specifies a complete  path  in  the  hierarchy,
       with  both  class  and  instance  names.   However, resource values are usually given with only partially
       specified names and classes, using pattern matching constructs.  An asterisk (*) is a loose  binding  and
       is  used  to  represent  any  number  of intervening components, including none.  A period (.) is a tight
       binding and is used to separate immediately adjacent components.  A question mark (?) is  used  to  match
       any  single component name or class.  A database entry cannot end in a loose binding; the final component
       (which cannot be "?") must be specified.  The lookup algorithm searches the  resource  database  for  the
       entry  that most closely matches (is most specific for) the full name and class being queried.  When more
       than one database entry matches the full name and class, precedence rules are used to select just one.

       The full name and class are scanned from left to right (from highest level in the hierarchy  to  lowest),
       one  component  at  a  time.   At each level, the corresponding component and/or binding of each matching
       entry is determined, and these matching components and bindings  are  compared  according  to  precedence
       rules.  Each of the rules is applied at each level, before moving to the next level, until a rule selects
       a single entry over all others.  The rules (in order of precedence) are:

       1.   An  entry  that  contains  a matching component (whether name, class, or "?")  takes precedence over
            entries that elide the level (that is, entries that match the level in a loose binding).

       2.   An entry with a matching name takes precedence over both entries with a matching class  and  entries
            that match using "?".  An entry with a matching class takes precedence over entries that match using
            "?".

       3.   An entry preceded by a tight binding takes precedence over entries preceded by a loose binding.

       Programs  based  on  the X Toolkit Intrinsics obtain resources from the following sources (other programs
       usually support some subset of these sources):

       <b>RESOURCE_MANAGER</b> <b>root</b> <b>window</b> <b>property</b>
               Any global resources that should be available to clients on all machines should be stored in  the
               RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of the first screen using the <u>xrdb</u> program.  This is
               frequently taken care of when the user starts up X through the display manager or <u>xinit</u>.

       <b>SCREEN_RESOURCES</b> <b>root</b> <b>window</b> <b>property</b>
               Any resources specific to a given screen (e.g. colors) that should be available to clients on all
               machines  should  be  stored  in the SCREEN_RESOURCES property on the root window of that screen.
               The <u>xrdb</u> program will  sort  resources  automatically  and  place  them  in  RESOURCE_MANAGER  or
               SCREEN_RESOURCES, as appropriate.

       <b>application-specific</b> <b>files</b>
               Directories  named  by  the  environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH or the environment variable
               XAPPLRESDIR (which names a single directory and should end with a '/'  on  POSIX  systems),  plus
               directories  in  a standard place (usually under <a href="file:/usr/share/X11/">/usr/share/X11/</a>, but this can be overridden with
               the XFILESEARCHPATH environment variable) are searched for application-specific  resources.   For
               example, application default resources are usually kept in /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/.  See the
               <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> <u>Intrinsics</u> <u>–</u> <u>C</u> <u>Language</u> <u>Interface</u> manual for details.

       <b>XENVIRONMENT</b>
               Any user- and machine-specific resources may be specified by setting the XENVIRONMENT environment
               variable  to  the  name of a resource file to be loaded by all applications.  If this variable is
               not defined, a file named <u>$HOME</u>/.Xdefaults-<u>hostname</u> is looked for instead, where <u>hostname</u> is  the
               name of the host where the application is executing.

       <b>-xrm</b> <u>resourcestring</u>
               Resources  can  also be specified from the command line.  The <u>resourcestring</u> is a single resource
               name and value as shown above.  Note that if the string contains characters  interpreted  by  the
               shell  (e.g.,  asterisk),  they must be quoted.  Any number of <b>-xrm</b> arguments may be given on the
               command line.

       Program resources are organized into groups called <u>classes</u>, so that collections of  individual  resources
       (each  of  which  are  called  <u>instances</u>)  can be set all at once.  By convention, the instance name of a
       resource begins with a lowercase letter and  class  name  with  an  upper  case  letter.   Multiple  word
       resources  are  concatenated  with  the  first  letter of the succeeding words capitalized.  Applications
       written with the X Toolkit Intrinsics will have at least the following resources:

       <b>background</b> <b>(</b>class <b>Background)</b>
               This resource specifies the color to use for the window background.

       <b>borderWidth</b> <b>(</b>class <b>BorderWidth)</b>
               This resource specifies the width in pixels of the window border.

       <b>borderColor</b> <b>(</b>class <b>BorderColor)</b>
               This resource specifies the color to use for the window border.

       Most applications using the X Toolkit Intrinsics also have the resource  <b>foreground</b>  (class  <b>Foreground</b>),
       specifying the color to use for text and graphics within the window.

       By  combining  class  and instance specifications, application preferences can be set quickly and easily.
       Users of color displays will frequently want to set  Background  and  Foreground  classes  to  particular
       defaults.   Specific color instances such as text cursors can then be overridden without having to define
       all of the related resources.  For example,

           bitmap*Dashed:  off
           XTerm*cursorColor:  gold
           XTerm*multiScroll:  on
           XTerm*jumpScroll:  on
           XTerm*reverseWrap:  on
           XTerm*curses:  on
           XTerm*Font:  6x10
           XTerm*scrollBar: on
           XTerm*scrollbar*thickness: 5
           XTerm*multiClickTime: 500
           XTerm*charClass:  33:48,37:48,45-47:48,64:48
           XTerm*cutNewline: off
           XTerm*cutToBeginningOfLine: off
           XTerm*titeInhibit:  on
           XTerm*ttyModes:  intr ^c erase ^? kill ^u
           XLoad*Background: gold
           XLoad*Foreground: red
           XLoad*highlight: black
           XLoad*borderWidth: 0
           emacs*Geometry:  80x65-0-0
           emacs*Background:  rgb:5b/76/86
           emacs*Foreground:  white
           emacs*Cursor:  white
           emacs*BorderColor:  white
           emacs*Font:  6x10
           xmag*geometry: -0-0
           xmag*borderColor:  white

       If these resources were stored in a file called <u>.Xresources</u> in your home directory, they could  be  added
       to any existing resources in the server with the following command:

           % xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xresources

       This  is  frequently  how  user-friendly  startup scripts merge user-specific defaults into any site-wide
       defaults.  All sites are encouraged to set up convenient ways of automatically loading resources. See the
       <u>Xlib</u> manual section <u>Resource</u> <u>Manager</u> <u>Functions</u> for more information.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b>
              This is the only mandatory environment variable. It  must  point  to  an  X  server.  See  section
              "Display Names" above.

       <b>XAUTHORITY</b>
              This  must point to a file that contains authorization data. The default is <u>$HOME/.Xauthority</u>. See
              <b><a href="../man7/Xsecurity.7.html">Xsecurity</a></b>(7), <b><a href="../man1/xauth.1.html">xauth</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/xdm.1.html">xdm</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man3/Xau.3.html">Xau</a></b>(3).

       <b>ICEAUTHORITY</b>
              This must point to a file that contains authorization data. The default is <u>$HOME/.ICEauthority</u>.

       <b>LC_ALL</b>, <b>LC_CTYPE</b>, <b>LANG</b>
              The first non-empty value among these three determines the current locale's  facet  for  character
              handling, and in particular the default text encoding. See <b><a href="../man7/locale.7.html">locale</a></b>(7), <b><a href="../man3/setlocale.3.html">setlocale</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man1/locale.1.html">locale</a></b>(1).

       <b>XMODIFIERS</b>
              This  variable  can  be  set  to  contain  additional information important for the current locale
              setting.  Typically  set  to  <u>@im=&lt;input-method&gt;</u>  to  enable  a  particular  input   method.   See
              <b><a href="../man3/XSetLocaleModifiers.3.html">XSetLocaleModifiers</a></b>(3).

       <b>XLOCALEDIR</b>
              This  must  point  to a directory containing the locale.alias file and Compose and XLC_LOCALE file
              hierarchies for all locales. The default value is <u><a href="file:/usr/share/X11/locale">/usr/share/X11/locale</a></u>.

       <b>XENVIRONMENT</b>
              This must point to a file containing X  resources.  The  default  is  <u>$HOME/.Xdefaults-&lt;hostname&gt;</u>.
              Unlike <u>$HOME/.Xresources</u>, it is consulted each time an X application starts.

       <b>XFILESEARCHPATH</b>
              This  must  contain a colon separated list of path templates, where libXt will search for resource
              files. The default value consists of

       <b>XUSERFILESEARCHPATH</b>
              This must contain a colon separated list of path templates,  where  libXt  will  search  for  user
              dependent resource files. The default value is:

           %  xcalc -bg blue -fg magenta
           %  xterm -geometry 80x66-0-0 -name myxterm $*

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       A  wide variety of error messages are generated from various programs.  The default error handler in <u>Xlib</u>
       (also used by many toolkits) uses standard resources to construct diagnostic messages when errors  occur.
       The  defaults  for  these  messages  are  usually stored in <u><a href="file:/usr/share/X11/XErrorDB">/usr/share/X11/XErrorDB</a></u>.  If this file is not
       present, error messages will be rather terse and cryptic.

       When the X Toolkit Intrinsics encounter errors converting resource strings to  the  appropriate  internal
       format,  no  error messages are usually printed.  This is convenient when it is desirable to have one set
       of resources across a variety of displays (e.g. color vs. monochrome, lots of fonts vs. very few,  etc.),
       although it can pose problems for trying to determine why an application might be failing.  This behavior
       can be overridden by the setting the <u>StringConversionWarnings</u> resource.

       To  force  the  X  Toolkit  Intrinsics  to  always  print string conversion error messages, the following
       resource should be placed in the file that gets loaded onto the RESOURCE_MANAGER property using the  <u>xrdb</u>
       program (frequently called <u>.Xresources</u> or <u>.Xres</u> in the user's home directory):

           *StringConversionWarnings: on

       To  have conversion messages printed for just a particular application, the appropriate instance name can
       be placed before the asterisk:

           xterm*StringConversionWarnings: on
