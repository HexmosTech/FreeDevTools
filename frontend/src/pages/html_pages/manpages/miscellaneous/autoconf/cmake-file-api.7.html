       cmake-file-api - CMake File-Based API

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       CMake  provides  a file-based API that clients may use to get semantic information about the buildsystems
       CMake generates.  Clients may use the API by writing query files to a specific location in a  build  tree
       to  request  zero  or more <u>Object</u> <u>Kinds</u>.  When CMake generates the buildsystem in that build tree it will
       read the query files and write reply files for the client to read.

       The file-based API uses a <b>&lt;build&gt;/.cmake/api/</b> directory at the top of a build tree.  The API is versioned
       to support changes to the layout of files within the  API  directory.   API  file  layout  versioning  is
       orthogonal  to  the  versioning of <u>Object</u> <u>Kinds</u> used in replies.  This version of CMake supports only one
       API version, <u>API</u> <u>v1</u>.

       Added in version 3.27: Projects may also submit queries for the current run  using  the  <u>cmake_file_api()</u>
       command.

</pre><h4><b>API</b> <b>V1</b></h4><pre>
       API v1 is housed in the <b>&lt;build&gt;/.cmake/api/v1/</b> directory.  It has the following subdirectories:

       <b>query/</b> Holds  query  files  written  by clients.  These may be <u>v1</u> <u>Shared</u> <u>Stateless</u> <u>Query</u> <u>Files</u>, <u>v1</u> <u>Client</u>
              <u>Stateless</u> <u>Query</u> <u>Files</u>, or <u>v1</u> <u>Client</u> <u>Stateful</u> <u>Query</u> <u>Files</u>.

       <b>reply/</b> Holds reply files written by CMake whenever it runs to generate a build system.  These are indexed
              by a <u>v1</u> <u>Reply</u> <u>Index</u> <u>File</u> file that may reference additional <u>v1</u> <u>Reply</u> <u>Files</u>.  CMake owns all  reply
              files.  Clients must never remove them.

              Clients  may  look for and read a reply index file at any time.  Clients may optionally create the
              <b>reply/</b> directory at any time and monitor it for the appearance of a new reply index file.

       Added in version 3.31: Users can add query files to <b>api/v1/query</b> inside the  <u>CMAKE_CONFIG_DIR</u>  to  create
       user-wide queries for all CMake projects.

   <b>v1</b> <b>Shared</b> <b>Stateless</b> <b>Query</b> <b>Files</b>
       Shared  stateless  query files allow clients to share requests for major versions of the <u>Object</u> <u>Kinds</u> and
       get all requested versions recognized by the CMake that runs.

       Clients may create shared requests by creating empty files in the <b>v1/query/</b> directory.  The form is:

          &lt;build&gt;/.cmake/api/v1/query/&lt;kind&gt;-v&lt;major&gt;

       where <b>&lt;kind&gt;</b> is one of the <u>Object</u> <u>Kinds</u>, <b>-v</b> is literal, and <b>&lt;major&gt;</b> is the major version number.

       Files of this form are stateless shared queries not owned by any  specific  client.   Once  created  they
       should not be removed without external client coordination or human intervention.

   <b>v1</b> <b>Client</b> <b>Stateless</b> <b>Query</b> <b>Files</b>
       Client  stateless  query  files  allow  clients to create owned requests for major versions of the <u>Object</u>
       <u>Kinds</u> and get all requested versions recognized by the CMake that runs.

       Clients may create owned requests by creating empty files in client-specific query  subdirectories.   The
       form is:

          &lt;build&gt;/.cmake/api/v1/query/client-&lt;client&gt;/&lt;kind&gt;-v&lt;major&gt;

       where  <b>client-</b>  is  literal,  <b>&lt;client&gt;</b>  is a string uniquely identifying the client, <b>&lt;kind&gt;</b> is one of the
       <u>Object</u> <u>Kinds</u>, <b>-v</b> is literal, and <b>&lt;major&gt;</b> is the major version number.  Each client must choose  a  unique
       <b>&lt;client&gt;</b> identifier via its own means.

       Files of this form are stateless queries owned by the client <b>&lt;client&gt;</b>.  The owning client may remove them
       at any time.

   <b>v1</b> <b>Client</b> <b>Stateful</b> <b>Query</b> <b>Files</b>
       Stateful query files allow clients to request a list of versions of each of the <u>Object</u> <u>Kinds</u> and get only
       the most recent version recognized by the CMake that runs.

       Clients  may  create  owned  stateful  queries  by  creating  <b>query.json</b>  files  in client-specific query
       subdirectories.  The form is:

          &lt;build&gt;/.cmake/api/v1/query/client-&lt;client&gt;/query.json

       where <b>client-</b> is literal, <b>&lt;client&gt;</b> is a  string  uniquely  identifying  the  client,  and  <b>query.json</b>  is
       literal.  Each client must choose a unique <b>&lt;client&gt;</b> identifier via its own means.

       <b>query.json</b>  files  are  stateful  queries  owned by the client <b>&lt;client&gt;</b>.  The owning client may update or
       remove them at any time.  When a given client installation is updated it may  then  update  the  stateful
       query  it writes to build trees to request newer object versions.  This can be used to avoid asking CMake
       to generate multiple object versions unnecessarily.

       A <b>query.json</b> file must contain a JSON object:

          {
            "requests": [
              { "kind": "&lt;kind&gt;" , "version": 1 },
              { "kind": "&lt;kind&gt;" , "version": { "major": 1, "minor": 2 } },
              { "kind": "&lt;kind&gt;" , "version": [2, 1] },
              { "kind": "&lt;kind&gt;" , "version": [2, { "major": 1, "minor": 2 }] },
              { "kind": "&lt;kind&gt;" , "version": 1, "client": {} },
              { "kind": "..." }
            ],
            "client": {}
          }

       The members are:

       <b>requests</b>
              A JSON array containing zero or more requests.  Each request is a JSON object with members:

              <b>kind</b>   Specifies one of the <u>Object</u> <u>Kinds</u> to be included in the reply.

              <b>version</b>
                     Indicates the version(s) of the object kind that the  client  understands.   Versions  have
                     major and minor components following semantic version conventions.  The value must be

                     • a JSON integer specifying a (non-negative) major version number, or

                     • a  JSON  object  containing  <b>major</b> and (optionally) <b>minor</b> members specifying non-negative
                       integer version components, or

                     • a JSON array whose elements are each one of the above.

              <b>client</b> Optional member reserved for use by the client.  This  value  is  preserved  in  the  reply
                     written  for  the  client in the <u>v1</u> <u>Reply</u> <u>Index</u> <u>File</u> but is otherwise ignored.  Clients may
                     use this to pass custom information with a request through to its reply.

              For each requested object kind CMake will choose the <u>first</u> version that  it  recognizes  for  that
              kind among those listed in the request.  The response will use the selected <u>major</u> version with the
              highest <u>minor</u> version known to the running CMake for that major version.  Therefore clients should
              list all supported major versions in preferred order along with the minimal minor version required
              for each major version.

       <b>client</b> Optional  member reserved for use by the client.  This value is preserved in the reply written for
              the client in the <u>v1</u> <u>Reply</u> <u>Index</u> <u>File</u> but is otherwise ignored.  Clients  may  use  this  to  pass
              custom information with a query through to its reply.

       Other  <b>query.json</b> top-level members are reserved for future use.  If present they are ignored for forward
       compatibility.

   <b>v1</b> <b>Reply</b> <b>Index</b> <b>File</b>
       CMake writes an <b>index-*.json</b> file to the <b>v1/reply/</b> directory whenever it runs to generate a build system.
       Clients must read the reply index file first and  may  read  other  <u>v1</u>  <u>Reply</u>  <u>Files</u>  only  by  following
       references.  The form of the reply index file name is:

          &lt;build&gt;/.cmake/api/v1/reply/index-&lt;unspecified&gt;.json

       where <b>index-</b> is literal and <b>&lt;unspecified&gt;</b> is an unspecified name selected by CMake.  Whenever a new index
       file is generated it is given a new name and any old one is deleted.  During the short time between these
       steps  there may be multiple index files present; the one with the largest name in lexicographic order is
       the current index file.

       The reply index file contains a JSON object:

          {
            "cmake": {
              "version": {
                "major": 3, "minor": 14, "patch": 0, "suffix": "",

            },
            "objects": [

                "version": { "major": 1, "minor": 0 },
                "jsonFile": "&lt;file&gt;" },
              { "...": "..." }
            ],
            "reply": {
              "&lt;kind&gt;-v&lt;major&gt;": { "kind": "&lt;kind&gt;",
                                   "version": { "major": 1, "minor": 0 },
                                   "jsonFile": "&lt;file&gt;" },
              "&lt;unknown&gt;": { "error": "unknown query file" },
              "...": {},
              "client-&lt;client&gt;": {
                "&lt;kind&gt;-v&lt;major&gt;": { "kind": "&lt;kind&gt;",
                                     "version": { "major": 1, "minor": 0 },
                                     "jsonFile": "&lt;file&gt;" },
                "&lt;unknown&gt;": { "error": "unknown query file" },
                "...": {},
                "query.json": {
                  "requests": [ {}, {}, {} ],
                  "responses": [
                    { "kind": "&lt;kind&gt;",
                      "version": { "major": 1, "minor": 0 },
                      "jsonFile": "&lt;file&gt;" },
                    { "error": "unknown query file" },
                    { "...": {} }
                  ],
                  "client": {}
                }
              }
            }
          }

       The members are:

       <b>reply</b>  A JSON object mirroring the content of the <b>query/</b> directory  that  CMake  loaded  to  produce  the
              reply.  The members are of the form

              <b>&lt;kind&gt;-v&lt;major&gt;</b>
                     A  member  of  this form appears for each of the <u>v1</u> <u>Shared</u> <u>Stateless</u> <u>Query</u> <u>Files</u> that CMake
                     recognized as a request for object kind <b>&lt;kind&gt;</b> with major version <b>&lt;major&gt;</b>.  The value is  a
                     <u>v1</u> <u>Reply</u> <u>File</u> <u>Reference</u> to the corresponding reply file for that object kind and version.

              <b>&lt;unknown&gt;</b>
                     A  member  of  this form appears for each of the <u>v1</u> <u>Shared</u> <u>Stateless</u> <u>Query</u> <u>Files</u> that CMake
                     did not recognize.  The value is a JSON object with a  single  <b>error</b>  member  containing  a

                     <b>&lt;unknown&gt;</b>
                            A member of this form appears for each of the <u>v1</u> <u>Client</u> <u>Stateless</u> <u>Query</u>  <u>Files</u>  that
                            CMake  did  not  recognize.   The  value is a JSON object with a single <b>error</b> member
                            containing a string with an error message indicating that the query file is unknown.

                     <b>query.json</b>
                            This member appears for clients using  <u>v1</u>  <u>Client</u>  <u>Stateful</u>  <u>Query</u>  <u>Files</u>.   If  the
                            <b>query.json</b>  file  failed  to  read  or parse as a JSON object, this member is a JSON
                            object with a single <b>error</b>  member  containing  a  string  with  an  error  message.
                            Otherwise,  this  member  is  a  JSON object mirroring the content of the <b>query.json</b>
                            file.  The members are:

                            <b>client</b> A copy of the <b>query.json</b> file <b>client</b> member, if it exists.

                            <b>requests</b>
                                   A copy of the <b>query.json</b> file <b>requests</b> member, if it exists.

                            <b>responses</b>
                                   If the <b>query.json</b> file <b>requests</b> member is missing or invalid, this member  is
                                   a  JSON  object  with a single <b>error</b> member containing a string with an error
                                   message.  Otherwise, this member contains a JSON array with  a  response  for
                                   each entry of the <b>requests</b> array, in the same order.  Each response is

                                   • a  JSON object with a single <b>error</b> member containing a string with an error
                                     message, or

                                   • a <u>v1</u> <u>Reply</u> <u>File</u> <u>Reference</u> to the corresponding reply file for the requested
                                     object kind and selected version.

       After reading the reply index file, clients may read the other <u>v1</u> <u>Reply</u> <u>Files</u> it references.

   <b>v1</b> <b>Reply</b> <b>File</b> <b>Reference</b>
       The reply index file represents each reference to another reply file using a JSON object with members:

       <b>kind</b>   A string specifying one of the <u>Object</u> <u>Kinds</u>.

       <b>version</b>
              A JSON object with members <b>major</b> and <b>minor</b> specifying integer version  components  of  the  object
              kind.

       <b>jsonFile</b>
              A  JSON  string specifying a path relative to the reply index file to another JSON file containing
              the object.

   <b>v1</b> <b>Reply</b> <b>Files</b>
       Reply files containing specific <u>Object</u> <u>Kinds</u> are  written  by  CMake.   The  names  of  these  files  are
       unspecified  and must not be interpreted by clients.  Clients must first read the <u>v1</u> <u>Reply</u> <u>Index</u> <u>File</u> and
       follow references to the names of the desired response objects.

       Reply files (including the index file) will never be replaced by files of the  same  name  but  different
       content.   This  allows  a client to read the files concurrently with a running CMake that may generate a
       new reply.  However, after generating a new reply CMake will attempt to remove reply files from  previous
       runs  that  it did not just write.  If a client attempts to read a reply file referenced by the index but
       finds the file missing, that means a concurrent CMake has generated a new reply.  The client  may  simply
       start again by reading the new reply index file.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>KINDS</b></h4><pre>
       The CMake file-based API reports semantic information about the build system using the following kinds of
       JSON  objects.   Each  kind of object is versioned independently using semantic versioning with major and
       minor components.  Every kind of object has the form:

          {
            "kind": "&lt;kind&gt;",
            "version": { "major": 1, "minor": 0 },
            "...": {}
          }

       The <b>kind</b> member is a string specifying the object kind name.  The <b>version</b> member is a  JSON  object  with
       <b>major</b> and <b>minor</b> members specifying integer components of the object kind's version.  Additional top-level
       members are specific to each object kind.

   <b>Object</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>"codemodel"</b>
       The <b>codemodel</b> object kind describes the build system structure as modeled by CMake.

       There is only one <b>codemodel</b> object major version, version 2.  Version 1 does not exist to avoid confusion
       with that from <u><a href="../man7/cmake-server.7.html">cmake-server</a>(7)</u> mode.

   <b>"codemodel"</b> <b>version</b> <b>2</b>

              <b>name</b>   A string specifying the name of the configuration, e.g. <b>Debug</b>.

              <b>directories</b>
                     A JSON array of entries each  corresponding  to  a  build  system  directory  whose  source
                     directory  contains  a  <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>  file.  The first entry corresponds to the top-level

                     <b>source</b> A string specifying the path to  the  source  directory,  represented  with  forward
                            slashes.  If the directory is inside the top-level source directory then the path is
                            specified  relative  to  that  directory  (with <b>.</b> for the top-level source directory
                            itself).  Otherwise the path is absolute.

                     <b>build</b>  A string specifying the path  to  the  build  directory,  represented  with  forward
                            slashes.   If the directory is inside the top-level build directory then the path is
                            specified relative to that directory (with  <b>.</b>  for  the  top-level  build  directory

                            that   corresponds   to  the  parent  directory  that  added  this  directory  as  a
                            subdirectory.

                     <b>childIndexes</b>
                            Optional member that is present when the directory has subdirectories.  The value is
                            a  JSON  array  of  entries  corresponding  to  child  directories  created  by  the
                            <u>add_subdirectory()</u>  or <u>subdirs()</u> command.  Each entry is an unsigned integer 0-based

                            corresponding  to the targets.  Each entry is an unsigned integer 0-based index into
                            the main <b>targets</b> array.

                     <b>minimumCMakeVersion</b>
                            Optional member present when a minimum required version of CMake is  known  for  the
                            directory.   This  is  the  <b>&lt;min&gt;</b>  version  given  to  the  most  local  call to the
                            <u>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)</u> command in  the  directory  itself  or  one  of  its
                            ancestors.  The value is a JSON object with one member:

                                   Each  component  is  an  unsigned  integer and the suffix may be an arbitrary
                                   string.

                     <b>hasInstallRule</b>
                            Optional member that is present with boolean value <b>true</b> when the directory or one of
                            its subdirectories contains any <u>install()</u> rules, i.e.  whether  a  <b>make</b>  <b>install</b>  or
                            equivalent rule is available.

                     <b>jsonFile</b>

                            This field was added in codemodel version 2.3.

              <b>projects</b>
                     A JSON array of entries corresponding to the top-level project and sub-projects defined  in
                     the   build   system.    Each   (sub-)project  corresponds  to  a  source  directory  whose
                     <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file calls the <u>project()</u> command with a  project  name  different  from  its
                     parent directory.  The first entry corresponds to the top-level project.

                            the project.  The first entry corresponds to the top-level directory of the project.
                            Each entry is an unsigned integer 0-based index into the main <b>directories</b> array.

                     <b>targetIndexes</b>
                            Optional member that is present when the project itself has targets, excluding those
                            belonging to sub-projects.  The value is a JSON array of  entries  corresponding  to
                            the  targets.  Each entry is an unsigned integer 0-based index into the main <b>targets</b>
                            array.

              <b>targets</b>
                     A JSON array of entries corresponding to  the  build  system  targets.   Such  targets  are
                     created  by  calls  to  <u>add_executable()</u>, <u>add_library()</u>, and <u>add_custom_target()</u>, excluding
                     imported targets and interface libraries (which do not generate  any  build  rules).   Each
                     entry is a JSON object containing members:

                     <b>name</b>   A string specifying the target name.

                     <b>id</b>     A  string  uniquely  identifying  the target.  This matches the <b>id</b> field in the file
                            referenced by <b>jsonFile</b>.

                     <b>directoryIndex</b>

                     <b>jsonFile</b>
                            A JSON string specifying a path relative to the codemodel file to another JSON  file
                            containing a <u>"codemodel"</u> <u>version</u> <u>2</u> <u>"target"</u> <u>object</u>.

   <b>"codemodel"</b> <b>version</b> <b>2</b> <b>"directory"</b> <b>object</b>
       A codemodel "directory" object is referenced by a <u>"codemodel"</u> <u>version</u> <u>2</u> object's <b>directories</b> array.  Each
       "directory" object is a JSON object with members:

       <b>paths</b>  A JSON object containing members:

              <b>source</b> A string specifying the path to the source directory, represented with forward slashes.  If
                     the  directory is inside the top-level source directory then the path is specified relative
                     to that directory (with <b>.</b> for the top-level source directory itself).  Otherwise  the  path
                     is absolute.

              <b>build</b>  A  string specifying the path to the build directory, represented with forward slashes.  If
                     the directory is inside the top-level build directory then the path is  specified  relative
                     to that directory (with <b>.</b> for the top-level build directory itself).  Otherwise the path is
                     absolute.

       <b>installers</b>
              A  JSON array of entries corresponding to <u>install()</u> rules.  Each entry is a JSON object containing
              members:

              <b>component</b>
                     A  string  specifying  the  component  selected  by  the  corresponding  <u>install()</u>  command
                     invocation.

              <b>destination</b>
                     Optional  member  that  is  present  for specific <b>type</b> values below.  The value is a string
                     specifying the install destination path.  The path may  be  absolute  or  relative  to  the
                     install prefix.

              <b>paths</b>  Optional  member that is present for specific <b>type</b> values below.  The value is a JSON array
                     of entries corresponding to the paths (files or directories) to be installed.   Each  entry
                     is one of:

                     • A  string  specifying  the  path  from which a file or directory is to be installed.  The
                       portion of the path not preceded by a <b>/</b> also specifies the path (name) to which the  file
                       or directory is to be installed under the destination.

                     • A JSON object with members:

                       <b>from</b>   A string specifying the path from which a file or directory is to be installed.

                       <b>to</b>     A  string  specifying  the  path to which the file or directory is to be installed
                              under the destination.

                     In both cases the paths are represented with forward slashes.  If the "from" path is inside
                     the top-level directory documented by the  corresponding  <b>type</b>  value,  then  the  path  is
                     specified relative to that directory.  Otherwise the path is absolute.

              <b>type</b>   A string specifying the type of installation rule.  The value is one of the following, with
                     some variants providing additional members:

                     <b>file</b>   An  <u>install(FILES)</u> or <u>install(PROGRAMS)</u> call.  The <b>destination</b> and <b>paths</b> members are
                            populated, with paths under the top-level <u>source</u> directory expressed relative to it.
                            The <b>isOptional</b> member may exist.  This type has no additional members.

                     <b>directory</b>

       The members specific to <b>cmakeFiles</b> objects are:

       <b>paths</b>  A JSON object containing members:

              <b>source</b> A string specifying the absolute path to the top-level source directory,  represented  with
                     forward slashes.

              <b>build</b>  A  string  specifying  the absolute path to the top-level build directory, represented with
                     forward slashes.

       <b>inputs</b> A JSON array whose entries are each a JSON object specifying an input  file  used  by  CMake  when
              configuring and generating the build system.  The members of each entry are:

              <b>path</b>   A  string  specifying the path to an input file to CMake, represented with forward slashes.
                     If the file is inside the top-level source directory then the path is specified relative to
                     that directory.  Otherwise the path is absolute.

              <b>isGenerated</b>
                     Optional member that is present with boolean value <b>true</b> if the path specifies a  file  that
                     is  under the top-level build directory and the build is out-of-source.  This member is not
                     available on in-source builds.

              <b>isExternal</b>
                     Optional member that is present with boolean value <b>true</b> if the path specifies a  file  that
                     is not under the top-level source or build directories.

              <b>isCMake</b>
                     Optional member that is present with boolean value <b>true</b> if the path specifies a file in the
                     CMake installation.

       <b>globsDependent</b>
              Optional  member  that is present when the project calls <u>file(GLOB)</u> or <u>file(GLOB_RECURSE)</u> with the
              <b>CONFIGURE_DEPENDS</b> option.  The value is a JSON array of JSON objects, each specifying  a  globbing
              expression  and  the  list  of paths it matched.  If the globbing expression no longer matches the
              same list of paths, CMake considers the build system to be out of date.

              This field was added in <b>cmakeFiles</b> version 1.1.

              The members of each entry are:

              <b>expression</b>
                     A string specifying the globbing expression.

              <b>recurse</b>
                     Optional member that is present with boolean value <b>true</b>  if  the  entry  corresponds  to  a
                     <u>file(GLOB_RECURSE)</u> call.  Otherwise the entry corresponds to a <u>file(GLOB)</u> call.

              <b>listDirectories</b>
                     Optional  member  that  is present with boolean value <b>true</b> if <u>file(GLOB)</u> was called without
                     <b>LIST_DIRECTORIES</b> <b>false</b> or <u>file(GLOB_RECURSE)</u> was called with <b>LIST_DIRECTORIES</b> <b>true</b>.

              <b>followSymlinks</b>
                     Optional member that is present with boolean value <b>true</b> if <u>file(GLOB)</u> was called  with  the
                     <b>FOLLOW_SYMLINKS</b> option.

              <b>relative</b>
                     Optional  member  that is present if <u>file(GLOB)</u> was called with the <b>RELATIVE</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> option.
                     The value is a string containing the <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> given.

              <b>paths</b>  A JSON array of strings  specifying  the  paths  matched  by  the  call  to  <u>file(GLOB)</u>  or
                     <u>file(GLOB_RECURSE)</u>.

   <b>Object</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>"toolchains"</b>

       The members specific to <b>toolchains</b> objects are:

       <b>toolchains</b>
              A JSON array whose entries are each a  JSON  object  specifying  a  toolchain  associated  with  a
              particular language. The members of each entry are:

              <b>language</b>
                     A JSON string specifying the toolchain language, like C or CXX. Language names are the same
                     as  language names that can be passed to the <u>project()</u> command. Because CMake only supports
                     a single toolchain per language, this field can be used as a key.

              <b>compiler</b>
                     A JSON object containing members:

                     <b>path</b>   Optional member that is present when the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER</u> variable  is  defined
                            for  the  current  language.  Its  value  is  a  JSON string holding the path to the
                            compiler.

                     <b>id</b>     Optional member that  is  present  when  the  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ID</u>  variable  is
                            defined  for  the  current language. Its value is a JSON string holding the ID (GNU,

                            defined  for the current language. Its value is a JSON string holding the version of
                            the compiler.

                     <b>target</b> Optional member that is present when the  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_TARGET</u>  variable  is
                            defined  for  the  current  language.  Its  value  is  a  JSON  string  holding  the
                            cross-compiling target of the compiler.

                     <b>implicit</b>
                            A JSON object containing members:

                                   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> variable is defined for the current
                                   language. Its value is a JSON array of JSON strings where each string holds a
                                   path to an implicit include directory for the compiler.

                            <b>linkDirectories</b>

                                   JSON strings where each string holds a path to an implicit link  library  for
                                   the compiler.

              <b>sourceFileExtensions</b>
                     Optional  member  that  is present when the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS</u> variable is
                     defined for the current language. Its value is a JSON array of JSON strings where each each
                     string holds a file extension (without the leading dot) for the language.
