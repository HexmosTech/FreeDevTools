</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cmake-commands - CMake Language Command Reference

</pre><h4><b>SCRIPTING</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       These commands are always available.

   <b>block</b>
       Added in version 3.25.

       Evaluate a group of commands with a dedicated variable and/or policy scope.

          block([SCOPE_FOR [POLICIES] [VARIABLES] ] [PROPAGATE &lt;var-name&gt;...])
            &lt;commands&gt;
          endblock()

       All  commands  between  <b>block()</b> and the matching <u>endblock()</u> are recorded without being invoked.  Once the
       <u>endblock()</u> is evaluated, the recorded list of commands is invoked inside the requested scopes,  then  the
       scopes created by the <b>block()</b> command are removed.

       <b>SCOPE_FOR</b>
              Specify which scopes must be created.

              <b>POLICIES</b>
                     Create  a  new  policy  scope.  This  is equivalent to <u>cmake_policy(PUSH)</u> with an automatic
                     <u>cmake_policy(POP)</u> when leaving the block scope.

              <b>VARIABLES</b>
                     Create a new variable scope.

              If <b>SCOPE_FOR</b> is not specified, this is equivalent to:

                 block(SCOPE_FOR VARIABLES POLICIES)

       <b>PROPAGATE</b>
              When a variable scope is created by the <u>block()</u> command, this option sets or unsets the  specified
              variables  in  the  parent  scope.  This is equivalent to <u>set(PARENT_SCOPE)</u> or <u>unset(PARENT_SCOPE)</u>
              commands.

                 set(var1 "INIT1")
                 set(var2 "INIT2")

                 block(PROPAGATE var1 var2)
                   set(var1 "VALUE1")
                   unset(var2)
                 endblock()

                 # Now var1 holds VALUE1, and var2 is unset

              This option is only allowed when a variable scope is created. An error will be raised in the other
              cases.

       When the <b>block()</b> is inside a <u>foreach()</u> or <u>while()</u> command, the <u>break()</u> and  <u>continue()</u>  commands  can  be
       used inside the block.

          while(TRUE)
            block()
               ...
               # the break() command will terminate the while() command
               break()
            endblock()
          endwhile()

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • <u>endblock()</u>

       • <u>return()</u>

       • <u>cmake_policy()</u>

   <b>break</b>
       Break from an enclosing foreach or while loop.

          break()

       Breaks from an enclosing <u>foreach()</u> or <u>while()</u> loop.

       See also the <u>continue()</u> command.

   <b>cmake_host_system_information</b>
       Query various host system information.

       If <b><a href="file:/etc/os-release">/etc/os-release</a></b> file is not found, the command tries to gather OS identification via fallback scripts.
       The fallback script can use <u>various</u> <u>distribution-specific</u> <u>files</u> to collect OS identification data and map
       it into <u>man</u> <u>5</u> <u>os-release</u> variables.

   <b>Fallback</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Variables</b>
       <b>CMAKE_GET_OS_RELEASE_FALLBACK_SCRIPTS</b>
              In addition to the scripts shipped with CMake, a user may append full paths to  his  script(s)  to
              the this list.  The script filename has the following format: <b>NNN-&lt;name&gt;.cmake</b>, where <b>NNN</b> is three
              digits used to apply collected scripts in a specific order.

       <b>CMAKE_GET_OS_RELEASE_FALLBACK_RESULT_&lt;varname&gt;</b>
              Variables  collected  by the user provided fallback script ought to be assigned to CMake variables
              using  this  naming  convention.    Example,   the   <b>ID</b>   variable   from   the   manual   becomes
              <b>CMAKE_GET_OS_RELEASE_FALLBACK_RESULT_ID</b>.

       <b>CMAKE_GET_OS_RELEASE_FALLBACK_RESULT</b>
              The      fallback      script      ought      to      store      names     of     all     assigned
              <b>CMAKE_GET_OS_RELEASE_FALLBACK_RESULT_&lt;varname&gt;</b> variables in this list.

   <b>Query</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>registry</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

          cmake_host_system_information(RESULT &lt;variable&gt;
                                        QUERY WINDOWS_REGISTRY &lt;key&gt; [VALUE_NAMES|SUBKEYS|VALUE &lt;name&gt;]
                                        [VIEW (64|32|64_32|32_64|HOST|TARGET|BOTH)]
                                        [SEPARATOR &lt;separator&gt;]
                                        [ERROR_VARIABLE &lt;result&gt;])

       Performs query operations on local computer registry subkey. Returns a list of  subkeys  or  value  names
       that  are located under the specified subkey in the registry or the data of the specified value name. The
       result of the queried entity is stored in <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Querying registry for any other platforms than <b>Windows</b>, including <b>CYGWIN</b>, will always returns an empty
          string and sets an error message in the variable specified with sub-option <b>ERROR_VARIABLE</b>.

       <b>&lt;key&gt;</b> specify the full path of a subkey on the local computer. The <b>&lt;key&gt;</b> must include a valid  root  key.
       Valid root keys for the local computer are:

       • <b>HKLM</b> or <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</b>

       • <b>HKCU</b> or <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</b>

       • <b>HKCR</b> or <b>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</b>

       • <b>HKU</b> or <b>HKEY_USERS</b>

       • <b>HKCC</b> or <b>HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG</b>

       And,  optionally,  the path to a subkey under the specified root key. The path separator can be the slash
       or the backslash. <b>&lt;key&gt;</b> is not case sensitive.  For example:

          cmake_host_system_information(RESULT result QUERY WINDOWS_REGISTRY "HKLM")
          cmake_host_system_information(RESULT result QUERY WINDOWS_REGISTRY "HKLM/SOFTWARE/Kitware")
          cmake_host_system_information(RESULT result QUERY WINDOWS_REGISTRY "HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Kitware")

       <b>VALUE_NAMES</b>
              Request the list of value names defined under <b>&lt;key&gt;</b>. If a default value is  defined,  it  will  be
              identified with the special name <b>(default)</b>.

       <b>SUBKEYS</b>
              Request the list of subkeys defined under <b>&lt;key&gt;</b>.

       <b>VALUE</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Request  the  data  stored  in  value  named  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>. If <b>VALUE</b> is not specified or argument is the
              special name <b>(default)</b>, the content of the default value, if any, will be returned.

                 # query default value for HKLM/SOFTWARE/Kitware key
                 cmake_host_system_information(RESULT result
                                               QUERY WINDOWS_REGISTRY "HKLM/SOFTWARE/Kitware")

                 # query default value for HKLM/SOFTWARE/Kitware key using special value name
                 cmake_host_system_information(RESULT result
                                               QUERY WINDOWS_REGISTRY "HKLM/SOFTWARE/Kitware"
                                               VALUE "(default)")

              Supported types are:

              • <b>REG_SZ</b>.

              • <b>REG_EXPAND_SZ</b>. The returned data is expanded.

              • <b>REG_MULTI_SZ</b>. The returned is expressed as a CMake list. See also <b>SEPARATOR</b> sub-option.

              • <b>REG_DWORD</b>.

              • <b>REG_QWORD</b>.

              For all other types, an empty string is returned.

       <b>VIEW</b>   Specify which registry views must be queried. When not specified, <b>BOTH</b> view is used.

              <b>64</b>     Query the 64bit registry. On <b>32bit</b> <b>Windows</b>, returns always an empty string.

              <b>32</b>     Query the 32bit registry.

              <b>64_32</b>  For <b>VALUE</b> sub-option or default value, query the registry using view <b>64</b>, and if the request
                     failed, query the registry using view <b>32</b>.  For <b>VALUE_NAMES</b> and <b>SUBKEYS</b>  sub-options,  query
                     both views (<b>64</b> and <b>32</b>) and merge the results (sorted and duplicates removed).

              <b>32_64</b>  For <b>VALUE</b> sub-option or default value, query the registry using view <b>32</b>, and if the request
                     failed,  query  the registry using view <b>64</b>.  For <b>VALUE_NAMES</b> and <b>SUBKEYS</b> sub-options, query
                     both views (<b>32</b> and <b>64</b>) and merge the results (sorted and duplicates removed).

              <b>HOST</b>   Query the registry matching the architecture of the host: <b>64</b> on <b>64bit</b>  <b>Windows</b>  and  <b>32</b>  on
                     <b>32bit</b> <b>Windows</b>.

              <b>TARGET</b> Query  the registry matching the architecture specified by <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u> variable. If
                     not defined, fallback to <b>HOST</b> view.

              <b>BOTH</b>   Query  both  views  (<b>32</b>  and  <b>64</b>).  The  order  depends  of   the   following   rules:   If
                     <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u> variable is defined. Use the following view depending of the content of
                     this variable:

                     • <b>8</b>: <b>64_32</b>

   <b>Introduction</b>
       This  command  will  call  meta-operations on built-in CMake commands or those created via the <u>macro()</u> or
       <u>function()</u> commands.

       <b>cmake_language</b> does not introduce a new variable or policy scope.

   <b>Calling</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>cmake_language(CALL</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;arg&gt;...])</b>
              Calls the named <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> with the given arguments (if any).  For example, the code:

                 set(message_command "message")
                 cmake_language(CALL ${message_command} STATUS "Hello World!")

              is equivalent to

                 message(STATUS "Hello World!")

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 To ensure consistency of the code, the following commands are not allowed:

                 • <b>if</b> / <b>elseif</b> / <b>else</b> / <b>endif</b>

                 • <b>block</b> / <b>endblock</b>

                 • <b>while</b> / <b>endwhile</b>

                 • <b>foreach</b> / <b>endforeach</b>

                 • <b>function</b> / <b>endfunction</b>

                 • <b>macro</b> / <b>endmacro</b>

   <b>Evaluating</b> <b>Code</b>
       <b>cmake_language(EVAL</b> <b>CODE</b> <b>&lt;code&gt;...)</b>
              Evaluates the <b>&lt;code&gt;...</b> as CMake code.

              For example, the code:

                 set(A TRUE)
                 set(B TRUE)
                 set(C TRUE)
                 set(condition "(A AND B) OR C")

                 cmake_language(EVAL CODE "
                   if (${condition})
                     message(STATUS TRUE)
                   else()
                     message(STATUS FALSE)
                   endif()"
                 )

              is equivalent to

                 set(A TRUE)
                 set(B TRUE)
                 set(C TRUE)
                 set(condition "(A AND B) OR C")

                 file(WRITE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/eval.cmake "
                   if (${condition})
                     message(STATUS TRUE)
                   else()
                     message(STATUS FALSE)
                   endif()"
                 )

                 include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/eval.cmake)

   <b>Deferring</b> <b>Calls</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       <b>cmake_language(DEFER</b> <b>&lt;options&gt;...</b> <b>CALL</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;arg&gt;...])</b>
              Schedules a call to the named <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> with the given arguments (if any)  to  occur  at  a  later
              time.  By default, deferred calls are executed as if written at the end of the current directory's
              <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>  file,  except  that  they  run even after a <u>return()</u> call.  Variable references in
              arguments are evaluated at the time the deferred call is executed.

              The options are:

              <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                     Schedule the call for the end of the given directory instead of the current directory.  The
                     <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> may reference either a  source  directory  or  its  corresponding  binary  directory.
                     Relative paths are treated as relative to the current source directory.

                     The  given  directory  must  be known to CMake, being either the top-level directory or one
                     added by <u>add_subdirectory()</u>.  Furthermore, the given directory must  not  yet  be  finished
                     processing.  This means it can be the current directory or one of its ancestors.

              <b>ID</b> <b>&lt;id&gt;</b>
                     Specify  an  identification  for  the deferred call.  The <b>&lt;id&gt;</b> may not be empty and may not
                     begin with a capital letter <b>A-Z</b>.  The <b>&lt;id&gt;</b> may begin with an underscore (<b>_</b>) only if it  was
                     generated automatically by an earlier call that used <b>ID_VAR</b> to get the id.

              <b>ID_VAR</b> <b>&lt;var&gt;</b>
                     Specify  a variable in which to store the identification for the deferred call.  If <b>ID</b> <b>&lt;id&gt;</b>
                     is not given, a new identification will be generated and the generated id will  start  with
                     an underscore (<b>_</b>).

              The currently scheduled list of deferred calls may be retrieved:

                 cmake_language(DEFER [DIRECTORY &lt;dir&gt;] GET_CALL_IDS &lt;var&gt;)

              This  will  store  in  <b>&lt;var&gt;</b> a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of deferred call ids.  The ids are for the
              directory scope in which the calls have been deferred to (i.e. where they will be executed), which
              can be different to the scope in which they were created.  The <b>DIRECTORY</b> option  can  be  used  to
              specify  the  scope for which to retrieve the call ids.  If that option is not given, the call ids
              for the current directory scope will be returned.

              Details of a specific call may be retrieved from its id:

                 cmake_language(DEFER [DIRECTORY &lt;dir&gt;] GET_CALL &lt;id&gt; &lt;var&gt;)

              This will store in <b>&lt;var&gt;</b> a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> in which the first element is the name of  the
              command  to  be  called, and the remaining elements are its unevaluated arguments (any contained <b>;</b>
              characters are included literally and  cannot  be  distinguished  from  multiple  arguments).   If
              multiple  calls  are  scheduled  with  the  same  id, this retrieves the first one.  If no call is
              scheduled with the given id in the specified <b>DIRECTORY</b> scope (or the current directory scope if no
              <b>DIRECTORY</b> option is given), this stores an empty string in the variable.

              Deferred calls may be canceled by their id:

                 cmake_language(DEFER [DIRECTORY &lt;dir&gt;] CANCEL_CALL &lt;id&gt;...)

              This cancels all deferred calls matching any of the given ids in the specified <b>DIRECTORY</b> scope (or
              the current directory scope if no <b>DIRECTORY</b> option is given).  Unknown ids are silently ignored.

   <b>Deferred</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Examples</b>
       For example, the code:

          cmake_language(DEFER CALL message "${deferred_message}")
          cmake_language(DEFER ID_VAR id CALL message "Canceled Message")
          cmake_language(DEFER CANCEL_CALL ${id})
          message("Immediate Message")
          set(deferred_message "Deferred Message")

       prints:

          Immediate Message
          Deferred Message

       The <b>Canceled</b> <b>Message</b> is never printed because its command is  canceled.   The  <b>deferred_message</b>  variable
       reference is not evaluated until the call site, so it can be set after the deferred call is scheduled.

       In  order  to  evaluate  variable  references  immediately when scheduling a deferred call, wrap it using
       <b>cmake_language(EVAL)</b>.  However, note that arguments will be re-evaluated in  the  deferred  call,  though
       that can be avoided by using bracket arguments.  For example:

          set(deferred_message "Deferred Message 1")
          set(re_evaluated [[${deferred_message}]])
          cmake_language(EVAL CODE "
            cmake_language(DEFER CALL message [[${deferred_message}]])
            cmake_language(DEFER CALL message \"${re_evaluated}\")
          ")
          message("Immediate Message")
          set(deferred_message "Deferred Message 2")

       also prints:

          Immediate Message
          Deferred Message 1
          Deferred Message 2

   <b>Dependency</b> <b>Providers</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          A high-level introduction to this feature can be found in the <u>Using</u> <u>Dependencies</u> <u>Guide</u>.

       <b>cmake_language(SET_DEPENDENCY_PROVIDER</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> <b>SUPPORTED_METHODS</b> <b>&lt;methods&gt;...)</b>
              When  a  call is made to <u>find_package()</u> or <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u>, the call may be forwarded
              to a dependency provider which then has the opportunity to fulfill the request.  If the request is
              for one of the <b>&lt;methods&gt;</b> specified when the provider was set, CMake calls the provider's <b>&lt;command&gt;</b>
              with a set of method-specific arguments.  If the provider does not fulfill the request, or if  the
              provider  doesn't support the request's method, or no provider is set, the built-in <u>find_package()</u>
              or <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> implementation is used to fulfill the request in the usual way.

              One or more of the following values can be specified for the <b>&lt;methods&gt;</b> when setting the provider:

              <b>FIND_PACKAGE</b>
                     The provider command accepts <u>find_package()</u> requests.

              <b>FETCHCONTENT_MAKEAVAILABLE_SERIAL</b>
                     The provider  command  accepts  <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u>  requests.   It  expects  each
                     dependency to be fed to the provider command one at a time, not the whole list in one go.

              Only  one  provider  can  be  set  at  any  point  in  time.   If  a  provider is already set when
              <b>cmake_language(SET_DEPENDENCY_PROVIDER)</b> is called, the new provider replaces  the  previously  set
              one.   The  specified <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> must already exist when <b>cmake_language(SET_DEPENDENCY_PROVIDER)</b> is
              called.  As a special case, providing an empty string for the  <b>&lt;command&gt;</b>  and  no  <b>&lt;methods&gt;</b>  will
              discard any previously set provider.

              The  dependency  provider  can  only  be  set  while  processing one of the files specified by the
              <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES</u> variable.  Thus, dependency providers can only be set as part  of
              the  first  call  to  <u>project()</u>.   Calling <b>cmake_language(SET_DEPENDENCY_PROVIDER)</b> outside of that
              context will result in an error.

              Added in version 3.30: The <u>PROPAGATE_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES_TO_TRY_COMPILE</u> global property can be  set
              if the dependency provider also wants to be enabled in whole-project calls to <u>try_compile()</u>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 The choice of dependency provider should always be under the user's control.  As a convenience,
                 a    project    may   choose   to   provide   a   file   that   users   can   list   in   their
                 <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES</u> variable, but the use of such a  file  should  always  be  the
                 user's choice.

   <b>Provider</b> <b>commands</b>
       Providers  define  a  single <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> to accept requests.  The name of the command should be specific to
       that provider, not something overly generic that another provider might also use.  This enables users  to
       compose    different   providers   in   their   own   custom   provider.    The   recommended   form   is
       <b>xxx_provide_dependency()</b>, where <b>xxx</b>  is  the  provider-specific  part  (e.g.  <b>vcpkg_provide_dependency()</b>,
       <b>conan_provide_dependency()</b>, <b>ourcompany_provide_dependency()</b>, and so on).

          xxx_provide_dependency(&lt;method&gt; [&lt;method-specific-args&gt;...])

       Because some methods expect certain variables to be set in the calling scope, the provider command should
       typically  be  implemented  as  a macro rather than a function.  This ensures it does not introduce a new
       variable scope.

       The arguments CMake passes to the dependency provider depend on the type of request.  The first  argument
       is  always  the method, and it will only ever be one of the <b>&lt;methods&gt;</b> that was specified when setting the
       provider.

       <b>FIND_PACKAGE</b>
              The <b>&lt;method-specific-args&gt;</b> will be everything passed to the <u>find_package()</u> call that requested the
              dependency.  The first of these <b>&lt;method-specific-args&gt;</b> will therefore always be the  name  of  the
              dependency.   Dependency  names  are  case-sensitive for this method because <u>find_package()</u> treats
              them case-sensitively too.

              If the provider command fulfills the request, it must set the same  variable  that  <u>find_package()</u>
              expects to be set.  For a dependency named <b>depName</b>, the provider must set <b>depName_FOUND</b> to true if
              it  fulfilled  the  request.   If  the  provider returns without setting this variable, CMake will
              assume the request was not fulfilled and will fall back to the built-in implementation.

              If the provider  needs  to  call  the  built-in  <u>find_package()</u>  implementation  as  part  of  its
              processing, it can do so by including the <b>BYPASS_PROVIDER</b> keyword as one of the arguments.

       <b>FETCHCONTENT_MAKEAVAILABLE_SERIAL</b>
              The  <b>&lt;method-specific-args&gt;</b>  will  be  everything  passed  to the <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u> call that
              corresponds to the requested dependency, with the following exceptions:

              • If <b>SOURCE_DIR</b> or <b>BINARY_DIR</b> were not part of the original declared arguments, they will be added
                with their default values.

              • If <u>FETCHCONTENT_TRY_FIND_PACKAGE_MODE</u> is set to <b>NEVER</b>, any <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b> will be omitted.

              • The <b>OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE</b> keyword is always omitted.

              The first of the <b>&lt;method-specific-args&gt;</b> will always be the name  of  the  dependency.   Dependency
              names   are   case-insensitive   for   this   method   because   <u>FetchContent</u>   also  treats  them
              case-insensitively.

              If the provider fulfills the request, it should call <u>FetchContent_SetPopulated()</u>, passing the name
              of the dependency as the first argument.  The <b>SOURCE_DIR</b> and <b>BINARY_DIR</b> arguments to that  command
              should only be given if the provider makes the dependency's source and build directories available
              in exactly the same way as the built-in <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> command.

              If  the  provider  returns  without  calling <u>FetchContent_SetPopulated()</u> for the named dependency,
              CMake will assume the request was not fulfilled and will fall back to the built-in implementation.

              Note that empty arguments may be significant for this method (e.g. an  empty  string  following  a
              <b>GIT_SUBMODULES</b>  keyword).   Therefore,  if forwarding these arguments on to another command, extra
              care must be taken to avoid such arguments being silently dropped.

              If <b>FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_&lt;uppercaseDepName&gt;</b> is set, then the dependency provider will never  see
              requests  for  the  <b>&lt;depName&gt;</b> dependency for this method. When the user sets such a variable, they
              are explicitly overriding where to get that dependency from and are taking on  the  responsibility
              that  their  overriding  version meets any requirements for that dependency and is compatible with
              whatever    else    in    the    project    uses    it.     Depending    on    the    value     of
              <u>FETCHCONTENT_TRY_FIND_PACKAGE_MODE</u>  and  whether  the  <b>OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE</b>  option  was given to
              <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u>, having <b>FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_&lt;uppercaseDepName&gt;</b> set may also prevent the
              dependency provider from seeing requests for a <b>find_package(depName)</b> call too.

   <b>Provider</b> <b>Examples</b>
       This first example only intercepts <u>find_package()</u> calls.  The provider  command  runs  an  external  tool
       which  copies  the  relevant  artifacts  into a provider-specific directory, if that tool knows about the
       dependency.   It  then  relies  on  the  built-in  implementation   to   then   find   those   artifacts.
       <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> calls would not go through the provider.

            CACHE PATH "The directory this provider installs packages to"
          )
          # Tell the built-in implementation to look in our area first, unless
          # the find_package() call uses NO_..._PATH options to exclude it
          list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${MYCOMP_PROVIDER_INSTALL_DIR}/cmake)
          list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH ${MYCOMP_PROVIDER_INSTALL_DIR})

            )

          cmake_language(
            SET_DEPENDENCY_PROVIDER mycomp_provide_dependency
            SUPPORTED_METHODS FIND_PACKAGE
          )

       The user would then typically use the above file like so:

          cmake -DCMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES=/path/to/mycomp_provider.cmake ...

       The  next  example  demonstrates  a  provider  that  accepts  both methods, but only handles one specific
       dependency.  It enforces providing Google Test using <u>FetchContent</u>, but leaves all other  dependencies  to
       be  fulfilled  by  CMake's built-in implementation.  It accepts a few different names, which demonstrates
       one way of working around projects that hard-code an unusual or undesirable way of adding this particular
       dependency to the build.  The example also demonstrates  how  to  use  the  <u>list()</u>  command  to  preserve
       variables that may be overwritten by a call to <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u>.

   <b>Getting</b> <b>current</b> <b>message</b> <b>log</b> <b>level</b>
       Added in version 3.25.

       <b>cmake_language(GET_MESSAGE_LOG_LEVEL</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;)</b>
              Writes the current <u>message()</u> logging level into the given <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b>.

              See <u>message()</u> for the possible logging levels.

              The  current  message logging level can be set either using the <u>--log-level</u> command line option of
              the <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u> program or using the <u>CMAKE_MESSAGE_LOG_LEVEL</u> variable.

              If both the command line  option  and  the  variable  are  set,  the  command  line  option  takes
              precedence. If neither are set, the default logging level is returned.

   <b>Terminating</b> <b>Scripts</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       <b>cmake_language(EXIT</b> <b>&lt;exit-code&gt;)</b>
              Terminate the current <u>cmake</u> <u>-P</u> script and exit with <b>&lt;exit-code&gt;</b>.

              This  command  works  only in <u>script</u> <u>mode</u>.  If used outside of that context, it will cause a fatal
              error.

              The <b>&lt;exit-code&gt;</b> should be  non-negative.   If  <b>&lt;exit-code&gt;</b>  is  negative,  then  the  behavior  is
              unspecified  (e.g., on Windows the error code -1 becomes <b>0xffffffff</b>, and on Linux it becomes 255).
              Exit codes above 255 may not be supported by the underlying shell or platform, and some shells may
              interpret values above 125 specially.  Therefore, it is advisable to only specify  an  <b>&lt;exit-code&gt;</b>
              in the range 0 to 125.

   <b>cmake_minimum_required</b>
       Require a minimum version of cmake.

          cmake_minimum_required(VERSION &lt;min&gt;[...&lt;policy_max&gt;] [FATAL_ERROR])

       Added in version 3.12: The optional <b>&lt;policy_max&gt;</b> version.

       Sets  the minimum required version of cmake for a project.  Also updates the policy settings as explained
       below.

       <b>&lt;min&gt;</b> and the optional <b>&lt;policy_max&gt;</b> are each CMake versions of the form <b>major.minor[.patch[.tweak]]</b>,  and
       the <b>...</b> is literal.

       If  the  running  version  of  CMake is lower than the <b>&lt;min&gt;</b> required version it will stop processing the
       project and report an error.  The optional <b>&lt;policy_max&gt;</b> version, if specified, must be at least the <b>&lt;min&gt;</b>
       version and affects policy settings as described in <u>Policy</u> <u>Settings</u>.  If the running version of CMake  is
       older  than  3.12,  the  extra  <b>...</b>   dots will be seen as version component separators, resulting in the
       <b>...&lt;max&gt;</b> part being ignored and preserving the pre-3.12 behavior of basing policies on <b>&lt;min&gt;</b>.

       This command will set the value of the <u>CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION</u> variable to <b>&lt;min&gt;</b>.

       The <b>FATAL_ERROR</b> option is accepted but ignored by CMake 2.6 and higher.  It should be specified so  CMake
       versions 2.4 and lower fail with an error instead of just a warning.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Call  the  <b>cmake_minimum_required()</b> command at the beginning of the top-level <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file even
          before calling the <u>project()</u> command.  It is important to establish version and policy settings before
          invoking other commands whose behavior they may affect.  See also policy <u>CMP0000</u>.

          Calling <b>cmake_minimum_required()</b> inside a <u>function()</u> limits some effects to the  function  scope  when
          invoked.   For example, the <u>CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION</u> variable won't be set in the calling scope.
          Functions do not introduce their own policy scope though, so policy settings of  the  caller  <u>will</u>  be
          affected  (see below).  Due to this mix of things that do and do not affect the calling scope, calling
          <b>cmake_minimum_required()</b> inside a function is generally discouraged.

   <b>Policy</b> <b>Settings</b>
       The <b>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)</b> command  implicitly  invokes  the  <u>cmake_policy(VERSION)</u>  command  to
       specify  that  the  current  project code is written for the given range of CMake versions.  All policies
       known to the running version of CMake and introduced in the <b>&lt;min&gt;</b> (or <b>&lt;max&gt;</b>,  if  specified)  version  or
       earlier  will be set to use <b>NEW</b> behavior.  All policies introduced in later versions will be unset.  This
       effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake version and tells  newer  CMake  versions  to
       warn about their new policies.

       When a <b>&lt;min&gt;</b> version higher than 2.4 is specified the command implicitly invokes

          cmake_policy(VERSION &lt;min&gt;[...&lt;max&gt;])

       which sets CMake policies based on the range of versions specified.  When a <b>&lt;min&gt;</b> version 2.4 or lower is
       given the command implicitly invokes

          cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4[...&lt;max&gt;])

       which enables compatibility features for CMake 2.4 and lower.

       Changed  in  version  3.31: Compatibility with versions of CMake older than 3.10 is deprecated.  Calls to
       <u>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)</u> or <u>cmake_policy(VERSION)</u> that do not  specify  at  least  3.10  as  their
       policy version (optionally via <b>...&lt;max&gt;</b>) will produce a deprecation warning in CMake 3.31 and above.

       Changed  in  version  3.27:  Compatibility with versions of CMake older than 3.5 is deprecated.  Calls to
       <u>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)</u> or <u>cmake_policy(VERSION)</u> that do not specify at least 3.5 as their policy
       version (optionally via <b>...&lt;max&gt;</b>) will produce a deprecation warning in CMake 3.27 and above.

       Changed in version 3.19: Compatibility with versions of CMake older than 2.8.12 is deprecated.  Calls  to
       <u>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)</u>  or  <u>cmake_policy(VERSION)</u>  that  do not specify at least 2.8.12 as their
       policy version (optionally via <b>...&lt;max&gt;</b>) will produce a deprecation warning in CMake 3.19 and above.

   <b>cmake_parse_arguments</b>
       Parse function or macro arguments.

          cmake_parse_arguments(&lt;prefix&gt; &lt;options&gt; &lt;one_value_keywords&gt;
                                &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt; &lt;args&gt;...)

          cmake_parse_arguments(PARSE_ARGV &lt;N&gt; &lt;prefix&gt; &lt;options&gt;
                                &lt;one_value_keywords&gt; &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt;)

       Added in version 3.5: This command is implemented natively.  Previously,  it  has  been  defined  in  the
       module <u>CMakeParseArguments</u>.

       This  command  is  for  use  in  macros  or functions.  It processes the arguments given to that macro or
       function, and defines a set of variables which hold the values of the respective options.

       The first signature reads arguments passed in the <b>&lt;args&gt;...</b>.  This may be used in either a <u>macro()</u>  or  a
       <u>function()</u>.

       Added  in  version 3.7: The <b>PARSE_ARGV</b> signature is only for use in a <u>function()</u> body.  In this case, the
       arguments that are parsed come from the <b>ARGV#</b> variables of the calling function.  The parsing starts with
       the <b>&lt;N&gt;</b>-th argument, where <b>&lt;N&gt;</b> is an unsigned integer.  This  allows  for  the  values  to  have  special
       characters like <b>;</b> in them.

       The <b>&lt;options&gt;</b> argument contains all options for the respective function or macro. These are keywords that
       have no value following them, like the <b>OPTIONAL</b> keyword of the <u>install()</u> command.

       The  <b>&lt;one_value_keywords&gt;</b> argument contains all keywords for this function or macro which are followed by
       one value, like the <b>DESTINATION</b> keyword of the <u>install()</u> command.

       The <b>&lt;multi_value_keywords&gt;</b> argument contains all keywords  for  this  function  or  macro  which  can  be
       followed by more than one value, like the <b>TARGETS</b> or <b>FILES</b> keywords of the <u>install()</u> command.

       Changed  in  version 3.5: All keywords must be unique.  Each keyword can only be specified once in any of
       the <b>&lt;options&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;one_value_keywords&gt;</b>, or <b>&lt;multi_value_keywords&gt;</b>. A warning will be emitted  if  uniqueness
       is violated.

       When   done,  <b>cmake_parse_arguments</b>  will  consider  for  each  of  the  keywords  listed  in  <b>&lt;options&gt;</b>,
       <b>&lt;one_value_keywords&gt;</b>, and <b>&lt;multi_value_keywords&gt;</b>, a variable composed of the given <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>  followed  by
       <b>"_"</b>  and  the name of the respective keyword.  For <b>&lt;one_value_keywords&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;multi_value_keywords&gt;</b>, these
       variables will then hold the respective  value(s)  from  the  argument  list,  or  be  undefined  if  the
       associated  keyword was not given (policy <u>CMP0174</u> can also affect the behavior for <b>&lt;one_value_keywords&gt;</b>).
       For the <b>&lt;options&gt;</b> keywords, these variables will always be defined, and they will be set to <b>TRUE</b>  if  the
       keyword is present, or <b>FALSE</b> if it is not.

       All remaining arguments are collected in a variable <b>&lt;prefix&gt;_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS</b> that will be undefined if
       all  arguments  were recognized. This can be checked afterwards to see whether your macro or function was
       called with unrecognized parameters.

       Added in version 3.15: <b>&lt;one_value_keywords&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;multi_value_keywords&gt;</b> that were given no values  at  all
       are  collected  in  a  variable  <b>&lt;prefix&gt;_KEYWORDS_MISSING_VALUES</b>  that will be undefined if all keywords
       received values. This can be checked to see if there were keywords without any values given.

       Changed in version 3.31: If a <b>&lt;one_value_keyword&gt;</b> is followed by an empty string  as  its  value,  policy
       <u>CMP0174</u> controls whether a corresponding <b>&lt;prefix&gt;_&lt;keyword&gt;</b> variable is defined or not.

       Choose a <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b> carefully to avoid clashing with existing variable names.  When used inside a function,
       it  is  usually  suitable to use the prefix <b>arg</b>.  There is a very strong convention that all keywords are
       fully uppercase, so this prefix results in variables of the form <b>arg_SOME_KEYWORD</b>.  This makes  the  code
       more  readable,  and  it  minimizes the chance of clashing with cache variables, which also have a strong
       convention of being all uppercase.

                  "${options}" "${oneValueArgs}" "${multiValueArgs}"
              )

              # The above will set or unset variables with the following names:

              #   arg_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS
              #   arg_KEYWORDS_MISSING_VALUES

       When used inside a macro, <b>arg</b> might not be a suitable prefix because the code  will  affect  the  calling
       scope.   If  another  macro  also  called  in  the  same  scope  were  to  use  <b>arg</b>  in  its  own call to
       <b>cmake_parse_arguments()</b>, and if there are any common keywords between the two macros,  the  later  call's
       variables  can  overwrite  or  remove  those  of the earlier macro's call.  Therefore, it is advisable to
       incorporate something unique from the macro name in the <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>, such as <b>arg_lowercase_macro_name</b>.

          <a href="../manmy_special_install/macro.my_special_install.html">macro</a>(my_special_install)

                  "${options}" "${oneValueArgs}" "${multiValueArgs}"
                  ${ARGN}
              )
              # ...
          endmacro()

       Suppose the above macros are called one after the other, like so:

          my_install(TARGETS foo bar DESTINATION bin OPTIONAL blub CONFIGURATIONS)
          my_special_install(TARGETS barry DESTINATION sbin RENAME FAST)

       After these two calls, the following describes the variables that will be set or unset:

          arg_my_install_OPTIONAL = TRUE
          arg_my_install_FAST = FALSE # was not present in call to my_install
          arg_my_install_DESTINATION = "bin"
          arg_my_install_RENAME &lt;UNSET&gt; # was not present
          arg_my_install_TARGETS = "foo;bar"
          arg_my_install_CONFIGURATIONS &lt;UNSET&gt; # was not present
          arg_my_install_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS = "blub" # nothing expected after "OPTIONAL"
          arg_my_install_KEYWORDS_MISSING_VALUES = "CONFIGURATIONS" # value was missing

          arg_my_special_install_OPTIONAL = FALSE # was not present
          arg_my_special_install_FAST = TRUE
          arg_my_special_install_DESTINATION = "sbin"
          arg_my_special_install_RENAME &lt;UNSET&gt; # value was missing
          arg_my_special_install_TARGETS = "barry"
          arg_my_special_install_CONFIGURATIONS &lt;UNSET&gt; # was not present
          arg_my_special_install_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS &lt;UNSET&gt;
          arg_my_special_install_KEYWORDS_MISSING_VALUES = "RENAME"

       Keywords terminate lists of values. If a keyword is given  directly  after  a  <b>&lt;one_value_keyword&gt;</b>,  that
       preceding    <b>&lt;one_value_keyword&gt;</b>    receives    no    value   and   the   keyword   is   added   to   the
       <b>&lt;prefix&gt;_KEYWORDS_MISSING_VALUES</b> variable.  In  the  above  example,  the  call  to  <b>my_special_install()</b>
       contains  the  <b>RENAME</b>  keyword  immediately  followed by the <b>FAST</b> keyword.  In this case, <b>FAST</b> terminates
       processing    of    the    <b>RENAME</b>    keyword.     <b>arg_my_special_install_FAST</b>    is    set    to    <b>TRUE</b>,
       <b>arg_my_special_install_RENAME</b>  is  unset, and <b>arg_my_special_install_KEYWORDS_MISSING_VALUES</b> contains the
       value <b>RENAME</b>.

   <b>cmake_path</b>
       Added in version 3.20.

       This command is for the manipulation of paths.  Only syntactic aspects of paths are handled, there is  no
       interaction  of  any kind with any underlying file system.  The path may represent a non-existing path or
       even one that is not allowed to exist on the current file system or platform.   For  operations  that  do
       interact with the filesystem, see the <u>file()</u> command.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The  <b>cmake_path</b>  command handles paths in the format of the build system (i.e. the host platform), not
          the target system.  When cross-compiling, if the path contains elements that are not representable  on
          the  host  platform  (e.g.  a  drive  letter  when  the  host  is  not  Windows),  the results will be
          unpredictable.

   <b>Conventions</b>
       The following conventions are used in this command's documentation:

       <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b>
              Always the name of a variable.  For commands that expect a <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b> as input, the variable  must
              exist and it is expected to hold a single path.

       <b>&lt;input&gt;</b>
              A  string  literal  which  may  contain  a  path,  path fragment, or multiple paths with a special
              separator depending on the command.  See the description of  each  command  to  see  how  this  is
              interpreted.

       <b>&lt;input&gt;...</b>
              Zero or more string literal arguments.

       <b>&lt;out-var&gt;</b>
              The name of a variable into which the result of a command will be written.

   <b>Path</b> <b>Structure</b> <b>And</b> <b>Terminology</b>
       A path has the following structure (all components are optional, with some constraints):

          root-name root-directory-separator (item-name directory-separator)* filename

       <b>root-name</b>
              Identifies  the  root  on  a  filesystem with multiple roots (such as <b>"C:"</b> or <b>"//myserver"</b>). It is
              optional.

       <b>root-directory-separator</b>
              A directory separator that, if present, indicates that this path is absolute.  If  it  is  missing
              and the first element other than the <b>root-name</b> is an <b>item-name</b>, then the path is relative.

       <b>item-name</b>
              A  sequence of characters that aren't directory separators.  This name may identify a file, a hard
              link, a symbolic link, or a directory.  Two special cases are recognized:

                 • The item name consisting of a single dot character <b>.</b> is a directory name that refers  to  the
                   current directory.

                 • The  item  name  consisting  of  two dot characters <b>..</b> is a directory name that refers to the
                   parent directory.

              The <b>(...)*</b> pattern shown above is to indicate that there can be zero  or  more  item  names,  with
              multiple items separated by a <b>directory-separator</b>.  The <b>()*</b> characters are not part of the path.

       <b>directory-separator</b>
              The  only  recognized  directory  separator  is a forward slash character <b>/</b>.  If this character is
              repeated, it is treated as a single directory separator.  In other words,  <b><a href="file:/usr///////lib">/usr///////lib</a></b>  is  the
              same as <b><a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a></b>.

       <b>filename</b>
              A  path has a <b>filename</b> if it does not end with a <b>directory-separator</b>.  The <b>filename</b> is effectively
              the last <b>item-name</b> of the path, so it can also be a hard link, symbolic link or a directory.

              A <b>filename</b> can have an <u>extension</u>.   By  default,  the  extension  is  defined  as  the  sub-string
              beginning  at  the  left-most period (including the period) and until the end of the <b>filename</b>.  In
              commands that accept a <b>LAST_ONLY</b> keyword, <b>LAST_ONLY</b> changes the interpretation to  the  sub-string
              beginning at the right-most period.

              The following exceptions apply to the above interpretation:

                 • If  the  first character in the <b>filename</b> is a period, that period is ignored (i.e. a <b>filename</b>
                   like <b>".profile"</b> is treated as having no extension).

                 • If the <b>filename</b> is either <b>.</b> or <b>..</b>, it has no extension.

              The <u>stem</u> is the part of the <b>filename</b> before the extension.

       Some commands refer to a <b>root-path</b>.  This is the concatenation of <b>root-name</b> and <b>root-directory-separator</b>,
       either or both of which can be empty.  A <b>relative-part</b>  refers  to  the  full  path  with  any  <b>root-path</b>
       removed.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>A</b> <b>Path</b> <b>Variable</b>
       While  a  path  can  be  created  with  care  using  an  ordinary <u>set()</u> command, it is recommended to use
       <u>cmake_path(SET)</u> instead, as it automatically converts the path to the required form where required.   The
       <u>cmake_path(APPEND)</u> subcommand may be another suitable alternative where a path needs to be constructed by
       joining fragments.  The following example compares the three methods for constructing the same path:

          set(path1 "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/data")

          cmake_path(SET path2 "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/data")

          cmake_path(APPEND path3 "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}" "data")

       <u>Modification</u>  and <u>Generation</u> sub-commands can either store the result in-place, or in a separate variable
       named after an <b>OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> keyword.  All other sub-commands store the result in a mandatory <b>&lt;out-var&gt;</b>
       variable.

   <b>Normalization</b>
       Some sub-commands support <u>normalizing</u> a path.  The algorithm used to normalize a path is as follows:

       1. If the path is empty, stop (the normalized form of an empty path is also an empty path).

       2. Replace each <b>directory-separator</b>, which may consist of multiple separators, with a  single  <b>/</b>  (<b>/a///b</b>
          <b>--&gt;</b> <b>/a/b</b>).

       3. Remove each solitary period (<b>.</b>) and any immediately following <b>directory-separator</b> (<b>/a/./b/.</b> <b>--&gt;</b> <b>/a/b</b>).

       4. Remove  each <b>item-name</b> (other than <b>..</b>) that is immediately followed by a <b>directory-separator</b> and a <b>..</b>,
          along with any immediately following <b>directory-separator</b> (<b>/a/b/../c</b> <b>--&gt;</b> <b>a/c</b>).

       5. If there is a <b>root-directory</b>, remove any <b>..</b> and any <b>directory-separators</b> immediately  following  them.
          The parent of the root directory is treated as still the root directory (<b>/../a</b> <b>--&gt;</b> <b>/a</b>).

       6. If the last <b>item-name</b> is <b>..</b>, remove any trailing <b>directory-separator</b> (<b>../</b> <b>--&gt;</b> <b>..</b>).

       7. If the path is empty by this stage, add a <b>dot</b> (normal form of <b>./</b> is <b>.</b>).

   <b>Decomposition</b>
       The following forms of the <b>GET</b> subcommand each retrieve a different component or group of components from
       a path.  See <u>Path</u> <u>Structure</u> <u>And</u> <u>Terminology</u> for the meaning of each path component.

          cmake_path(GET &lt;path-var&gt; ROOT_NAME &lt;out-var&gt;)
          cmake_path(GET &lt;path-var&gt; ROOT_DIRECTORY &lt;out-var&gt;)
          cmake_path(GET &lt;path-var&gt; ROOT_PATH &lt;out-var&gt;)
          cmake_path(GET &lt;path-var&gt; FILENAME &lt;out-var&gt;)
          cmake_path(GET &lt;path-var&gt; EXTENSION [LAST_ONLY] &lt;out-var&gt;)
          cmake_path(GET &lt;path-var&gt; STEM [LAST_ONLY] &lt;out-var&gt;)
          cmake_path(GET &lt;path-var&gt; RELATIVE_PART &lt;out-var&gt;)
          cmake_path(GET &lt;path-var&gt; PARENT_PATH &lt;out-var&gt;)

       If  a  requested  component is not present in the path, an empty string will be stored in <b>&lt;out-var&gt;</b>.  For
       example, only Windows systems have the concept of a <b>root-name</b>, so when the host machine  is  non-Windows,
       the <b>ROOT_NAME</b> subcommand will always return an empty string.

       For  <b>PARENT_PATH</b>,  if the <u>HAS_RELATIVE_PART</u> subcommand returns false, the result is a copy of <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b>.
       Note that this implies that a root directory is considered to have  a  parent,  with  that  parent  being
       itself.   Where  <u>HAS_RELATIVE_PART</u>  returns true, the result will essentially be <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b> with one less
       element.

   <b>Query</b>
       Each of the <b>GET</b> subcommands has a corresponding <b>HAS_...</b>  subcommand which can be used to discover whether
       a particular path component is present.  See <u>Path</u> <u>Structure</u> <u>And</u> <u>Terminology</u> for the meaning of each  path
       component.

          cmake_path(HAS_ROOT_NAME &lt;path-var&gt; &lt;out-var&gt;)
          cmake_path(HAS_ROOT_DIRECTORY &lt;path-var&gt; &lt;out-var&gt;)
          cmake_path(HAS_ROOT_PATH &lt;path-var&gt; &lt;out-var&gt;)
          cmake_path(HAS_FILENAME &lt;path-var&gt; &lt;out-var&gt;)
          cmake_path(HAS_EXTENSION &lt;path-var&gt; &lt;out-var&gt;)
          cmake_path(HAS_STEM &lt;path-var&gt; &lt;out-var&gt;)
          cmake_path(HAS_RELATIVE_PART &lt;path-var&gt; &lt;out-var&gt;)
          cmake_path(HAS_PARENT_PATH &lt;path-var&gt; &lt;out-var&gt;)

       Each  of  the  above  follows  the  predictable  pattern of setting <b>&lt;out-var&gt;</b> to true if the path has the
       associated component, or false otherwise.  Note the following special cases:

       • For <b>HAS_ROOT_PATH</b>, a true result will only be returned if at least one of <b>root-name</b>  or  <b>root-directory</b>
         is non-empty.

       • For <b>HAS_PARENT_PATH</b>, the root directory is also considered to have a parent, which will be itself.  The
         result is true except if the path consists of just a <u>filename</u>.

          cmake_path(IS_ABSOLUTE &lt;path-var&gt; &lt;out-var&gt;)

       Sets  <b>&lt;out-var&gt;</b>  to  true  if  <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b>  is  absolute.   An  absolute path is a path that unambiguously
       identifies the location of a file without reference to an additional starting location.  On Windows, this
       means the path must have both a <b>root-name</b> and a <b>root-directory-separator</b> to be considered  absolute.   On
       other  platforms,  just  a  <b>root-directory-separator</b>  is  sufficient.   Note  that this means on Windows,
       <b>IS_ABSOLUTE</b> can be false while <b>HAS_ROOT_DIRECTORY</b> can be true.

          cmake_path(IS_RELATIVE &lt;path-var&gt; &lt;out-var&gt;)

       This will store the opposite of <b>IS_ABSOLUTE</b> in <b>&lt;out-var&gt;</b>.

          cmake_path(IS_PREFIX &lt;path-var&gt; &lt;input&gt; [NORMALIZE] &lt;out-var&gt;)

       Checks if <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b> is the prefix of <b>&lt;input&gt;</b>.

       When the <b>NORMALIZE</b> option is specified, <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> are <u>normalized</u> before the check.

          set(path "/a/b/c")
          cmake_path(IS_PREFIX path "/a/b/c/d" result) # result = true
          cmake_path(IS_PREFIX path "/a/b" result)     # result = false
          cmake_path(IS_PREFIX path "/x/y/z" result)   # result = false

          set(path "/a/b")
          cmake_path(IS_PREFIX path "/a/c/../b" NORMALIZE result)   # result = true

          cmake_path(COMPARE &lt;input1&gt; EQUAL &lt;input2&gt; &lt;out-var&gt;)
          cmake_path(COMPARE &lt;input1&gt; NOT_EQUAL &lt;input2&gt; &lt;out-var&gt;)

       Compares the lexical representations of two paths provided  as  string  literals.   No  normalization  is
       performed on either path, except multiple consecutive directory separators are effectively collapsed into
       a single separator.  Equality is determined according to the following pseudo-code logic:

          if(NOT &lt;input1&gt;.root_name() STREQUAL &lt;input2&gt;.root_name())
            return FALSE

          if(&lt;input1&gt;.has_root_directory() XOR &lt;input2&gt;.has_root_directory())
            return FALSE

          Return FALSE if a relative portion of &lt;input1&gt; is not lexicographically
          equal to the relative portion of &lt;input2&gt;. This comparison is performed path
          component-wise. If all of the components compare equal, then return TRUE.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Unlike most other <b>cmake_path()</b> subcommands, the <b>COMPARE</b> subcommand takes literal strings as input, not
          the names of variables.

   <b>Modification</b>
          cmake_path(SET &lt;path-var&gt; [NORMALIZE] &lt;input&gt;)

       Assign  the  <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> path to <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b>.  If <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> is a native path, it is converted into a cmake-style
       path with forward-slashes (<b>/</b>). On Windows, the long filename marker is taken into account.

       When the <b>NORMALIZE</b> option is specified, the path is <u>normalized</u> after the conversion.

       For example:

          set(native_path "c:\\a\\b/..\\c")
          cmake_path(SET path "${native_path}")
          message("CMake path is \"${path}\"")

          cmake_path(SET path NORMALIZE "${native_path}")
          message("Normalized CMake path is \"${path}\"")

       Output:

          CMake path is "c:/a/b/../c"
          Normalized CMake path is "c:/a/c"

          cmake_path(APPEND &lt;path-var&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...] [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;out-var&gt;])

       Append all the <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> arguments to the <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b> using <b>/</b> as the <b>directory-separator</b>.  Depending on  the
       <b>&lt;input&gt;</b>,  the previous contents of <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b> may be discarded.  For each <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> argument, the following
       algorithm (pseudo-code) applies:

          # &lt;path&gt; is the contents of &lt;path-var&gt;

          if(&lt;input&gt;.is_absolute() OR
             (&lt;input&gt;.has_root_name() AND
              NOT &lt;input&gt;.root_name() STREQUAL &lt;path&gt;.root_name()))
            replace &lt;path&gt; with &lt;input&gt;
            return()
          endif()

          if(&lt;input&gt;.has_root_directory())
            remove any root-directory and the entire relative path from &lt;path&gt;
          elseif(&lt;path&gt;.has_filename() OR
                 (NOT &lt;path-var&gt;.has_root_directory() OR &lt;path&gt;.is_absolute()))
            append directory-separator to &lt;path&gt;
          endif()

          append &lt;input&gt; omitting any root-name to &lt;path&gt;

          cmake_path(APPEND_STRING &lt;path-var&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...] [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;out-var&gt;])

       Append all the <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> arguments to the <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b> without adding any <b>directory-separator</b>.

          cmake_path(REMOVE_FILENAME &lt;path-var&gt; [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;out-var&gt;])

       Removes the <u>filename</u> component (as returned by <u>GET</u> <u>...</u> <u>FILENAME</u>) from  <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b>.   After  removal,  any
       trailing <b>directory-separator</b> is left alone, if present.

       If  <b>OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b>  is  not  given,  then  after  this  function returns, <u>HAS_FILENAME</u> returns false for
       <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b>.

       For example:

          set(path "/a/b")
          cmake_path(REMOVE_FILENAME path)
          message("First path is \"${path}\"")

          # filename is now already empty, the following removes nothing
          cmake_path(REMOVE_FILENAME path)
          message("Second path is \"${path}\"")

       Output:

          First path is "/a/"
          Second path is "/a/"

          cmake_path(REPLACE_FILENAME &lt;path-var&gt; &lt;input&gt; [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;out-var&gt;])

       Replaces the <u>filename</u> component from <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b> with <b>&lt;input&gt;</b>.  If <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b> has  no  filename  component
       (i.e.  <u>HAS_FILENAME</u> returns false), the path is unchanged.  The operation is equivalent to the following:

          cmake_path(HAS_FILENAME path has_filename)
          if(has_filename)
            cmake_path(REMOVE_FILENAME path)
            cmake_path(APPEND path input);
          endif()

          cmake_path(REMOVE_EXTENSION &lt;path-var&gt; [LAST_ONLY]
                                                 [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;out-var&gt;])

       Removes the <u>extension</u>, if any, from <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b>.

          cmake_path(REPLACE_EXTENSION &lt;path-var&gt; [LAST_ONLY] &lt;input&gt;
                                       [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;out-var&gt;])

       Replaces the <u>extension</u> with <b>&lt;input&gt;</b>.  Its effect is equivalent to the following:

          cmake_path(REMOVE_EXTENSION path)
          if(NOT "input" MATCHES "^\\.")
            cmake_path(APPEND_STRING path ".")
          endif()
          cmake_path(APPEND_STRING path "input")

   <b>Generation</b>
          cmake_path(NORMAL_PATH &lt;path-var&gt; [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;out-var&gt;])

       Normalize <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b> according the steps described in <u>Normalization</u>.

          cmake_path(RELATIVE_PATH &lt;path-var&gt; [BASE_DIRECTORY &lt;input&gt;]
                                              [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;out-var&gt;])

       Modifies  <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b>  to  make  it  relative  to  the  <b>BASE_DIRECTORY</b> argument.  If <b>BASE_DIRECTORY</b> is not
       specified, the default base directory will be <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>.

       For reference, the algorithm used to compute the relative path  is  the  same  as  that  used  by  C++  ‐
       <u>std::filesystem::path::lexically_relative</u>.

          cmake_path(ABSOLUTE_PATH &lt;path-var&gt; [BASE_DIRECTORY &lt;input&gt;] [NORMALIZE]
                                              [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;out-var&gt;])

       If  <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b>  is  a  relative  path  (<u>IS_RELATIVE</u>  is true), it is evaluated relative to the given base
       directory specified by <b>BASE_DIRECTORY</b> option.  If <b>BASE_DIRECTORY</b>  is  not  specified,  the  default  base
       directory will be <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>.

       When the <b>NORMALIZE</b> option is specified, the path is <u>normalized</u> after the path computation.

       Because  <b>cmake_path()</b>  does  not  access  the filesystem, symbolic links are not resolved and any leading
       tilde is not expanded.  To compute a real path with symbolic links resolved and leading tildes  expanded,
       use the <u>file(REAL_PATH)</u> command instead.

   <b>Native</b> <b>Conversion</b>
       For  commands  in  this  section,  <u>native</u>  refers  to  the  host  platform,  not the target platform when
       cross-compiling.

          cmake_path(NATIVE_PATH &lt;path-var&gt; [NORMALIZE] &lt;out-var&gt;)

       Converts a cmake-style <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b> into a native path with platform-specific slashes (<b>\</b> on  Windows  hosts
       and <b>/</b> elsewhere).

       When the <b>NORMALIZE</b> option is specified, the path is <u>normalized</u> before the conversion.

          cmake_path(CONVERT &lt;input&gt; TO_CMAKE_PATH_LIST &lt;out-var&gt; [NORMALIZE])

       Converts  a  native <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> path into a cmake-style path with forward slashes (<b>/</b>).  On Windows hosts, the
       long filename marker is taken into account.  The input can be a single path or a system search path  like
       <b>$ENV{PATH}</b>.   A  search  path  will  be  converted  to  a  cmake-style list separated by <b>;</b> characters (on
       non-Windows platforms, this essentially means <b>:</b> separators are replaced  with  <b>;</b>).   The  result  of  the
       conversion is stored in the <b>&lt;out-var&gt;</b> variable.

       When the <b>NORMALIZE</b> option is specified, the path is <u>normalized</u> before the conversion.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Unlike  most  other  <b>cmake_path()</b> subcommands, the <b>CONVERT</b> subcommand takes a literal string as input,
          not the name of a variable.

          cmake_path(CONVERT &lt;input&gt; TO_NATIVE_PATH_LIST &lt;out-var&gt; [NORMALIZE])

       Converts a cmake-style <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> path into a native path with platform-specific slashes (<b>\</b> on Windows hosts
       and <b>/</b> elsewhere).  The input can be a single path or a cmake-style list.  A list will be converted into a
       native search path (<b>;</b>-separated  on  Windows,  <b>:</b>-separated  on  other  platforms).   The  result  of  the
       conversion is stored in the <b>&lt;out-var&gt;</b> variable.

       When the <b>NORMALIZE</b> option is specified, the path is <u>normalized</u> before the conversion.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Unlike  most  other  <b>cmake_path()</b> subcommands, the <b>CONVERT</b> subcommand takes a literal string as input,
          not the name of a variable.

       For example:

          set(paths "/a/b/c" "/x/y/z")
          cmake_path(CONVERT "${paths}" TO_NATIVE_PATH_LIST native_paths)
          message("Native path list is \"${native_paths}\"")

       Output on Windows:

          Native path list is "\a\b\c;\x\y\z"

       Output on all other platforms:

          Native path list is "/a/b/c:/x/y/z"

   <b>Hashing</b>
          cmake_path(HASH &lt;path-var&gt; &lt;out-var&gt;)

       Compute a hash value of <b>&lt;path-var&gt;</b> such that for two paths <b>p1</b> and <b>p2</b>  that  compare  equal  (<u>COMPARE</u>  <u>...</u>
       <u>EQUAL</u>),  the hash value of <b>p1</b> is equal to the hash value of <b>p2</b>.  The path is always <u>normalized</u> before the
       hash is computed.

   <b>cmake_pkg_config</b>
       Added in version 3.31.

       Process pkg-config format package files.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
          cmake_pkg_config(EXTRACT &lt;package&gt; [&lt;version&gt;] [...])

   <b>Introduction</b>
       This command generates CMake variables and targets from pkg-config format package files natively, without
       needing to invoke or even require the presence of a pkg-config implementation. A <b>&lt;package&gt;</b> is  either  an
       absolute path to a package file, or a package name to be searched for using the typical pkg-config search
       patterns.  The  optional <b>&lt;version&gt;</b> string has the same format and semantics as a pkg-config style version
       specifier, with the exception that if no comparison operator is specified <b>=</b> is assumed.

       There are multiple signatures for this command, and some of the options are  common  between  them.  They
       are:

       <b>EXACT</b> <b>/</b> <b>QUIET</b> <b>/</b> <b>REQUIRED</b>
              The  <b>EXACT</b>  option requests that the version string be matched exactly (including empty string, if
              no version is provided), overriding the typical pkg-config version comparison algorithm. This will
              ignore any comparison operator attached to the version string.

              The <b>QUIET</b> option disables informational messages, including  those  indicating  that  the  package
              cannot  be found if it is not <b>REQUIRED</b>. The <b>REQUIRED</b> option stops processing with an error message
              if the package cannot be found.

       <b>STRICTNESS</b> <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>
              Specify how strictly the contents of the  package  files  will  be  verified  during  parsing  and
              resolution.  An  invalid file, under the provided strictness mode, will cause the command to fail.
              Possible modes are:

              • <b>STRICT</b>: Closely mirrors the behavior of the original FDO  pkg-config.   Variables  and  keywords
                must  be  unique.  Variables  must  be  defined before they are used. The Name, Description, and
                Version keywords must be present.  The overall structure of the file must be valid and parsable.

              • <b>PERMISSIVE</b>: Closely mirrors the behavior of the pkgconf implementation.  Duplicate variables are
                overridden. Duplicate keywords are appended.  Undefined variables resolve to empty strings.  The
                Name,  Description, and Version keywords must be present. The overall structure of the file must
                be valid and parsable.

              • <b>BEST_EFFORT</b>: Same behavior as <b>PERMISSIVE</b> with regards to duplicate  or  uninitialized  variables
                and  keywords,  but  will not fail under any conditions. Package files which require BEST_EFFORT
                will fail validation under all other major implementations and should be fixed.

              The default strictness is <b>PERMISSIVE</b>.

       <b>ENV_MODE</b>
              Specifies which environment variables will be queried when running a given command. Possible modes
              are:

              • <b>FDO</b>:  Queries  only  the  original  set  of  <b>PKG_CONFIG_*</b>  environment  variables  used  by  the
                freedesktop.org <b>pkg-config</b> implementation.

              • <b>PKGCONF</b>:  Queries  the  more  extensive  set  of  environment  variables  used  by  the  <b>pkgconf</b>
                implementation.

              • <b>IGNORE</b>: Ignores the presence, absence, and value of environment variables entirely. In all cases
                an environment variable would be queried its treated as defined,  but  with  a  value  of  empty
                string  for  the  purpose  of  the  operation. This does not modify the current environment. For
                boolean environment variables, such as <b>PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_*</b>, this  means  they  are  evaluated  as
                truthy.

                <b>PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_PATH</b>  is  a  minor  exception.  When  <b>ENV_MODE</b>  <b>IGNORE</b>  is used, no root path
                prepending will occur by default and <b>pc_sysrootdir</b> remains defaulted to <b>/</b>.

              Target-generating subcommands always ignore  flag-filtering  environment  variables.  The  default
              environment mode is <b>PKGCONF</b>.

       <b>PC_LIBDIR</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;...</b>
              Overrides  the  default search location for package files; also used to derive the <b>pc_path</b> package
              variable.

              When this option is not provided, the default library directory is  the  first  available  of  the
              following values:

              1. <b>CMAKE_PKG_CONFIG_PC_LIB_DIRS</b>

              2. The <b>PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR</b> environment variable

              3. The output of <b>pkg-config</b> <b>--variable</b> <b>pc_path</b> <b>pkg-config</b>

              4. A platform-dependent default value

       <b>PC_PATH</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;...</b>
              Overrides  the  supplemental  package file directories which will be prepended to the search path;
              also used to derive the <b>pc_path</b> package variable.

              When this option is not provided, the default paths are  the  first  available  of  the  following
              values:

              1. <b>CMAKE_PKG_CONFIG_PC_PATH</b>

              2. The <b>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</b> environment variable

              3. Empty list

       <b>DISABLE_UNINSTALLED</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Overrides  the  search  behavior  for "uninstalled" package files. These are package files with an
              "-uninstalled" suffix which describe packages integrated directly from a build tree.

              Normally  such  package  files   have   higher   priority   than   "installed"   packages.    When
              <b>DISABLE_UNINSTALLED</b> is true, searching for "uninstalled" packages is disabled.

              When this option is not provided, the default search behavior is determined by the first available
              of the following values:

              1. <b>CMAKE_PKG_CONFIG_DISABLE_UNINSTALLED</b>

              2. If  the  <b>PKG_CONFIG_DISABLE_UNINSTALLED</b> environment variable is defined the search is disabled,
                 otherwise it is enabled.

       <b>PC_SYSROOT_DIR</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Overrides the root path which will be prepended to paths specified by  <b>-I</b>  compile  flags  and  <b>-L</b>
              library search locations; also used to derive the <b>pc_sysrootdir</b> package variable.

              When  this option is not provided, the default root path is provided by the first available of the
              following values:

              1. <b>CMAKE_PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR</b>

              2. The <b>PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR</b> environment variable

              3. If no root path is available, nothing will be prepended to include or library  directory  paths
                 and <b>pc_sysrootdir</b> will be set to <b>/</b>

       <b>TOP_BUILD_DIR</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Overrides the top build directory path used to derived the <b>pc_top_builddir</b> package variable.

              When  this  option is not provided, the default top build directory path is the first available of
              the following values:

              1. <b>CMAKE_PKG_CONFIG_TOP_BUILD_DIR</b>

              2. The <b>PKG_CONFIG_TOP_BUILD_DIR</b> environment variable

              3. If no top build directory path is available, the <b>pc_top_builddir</b> package variable is not set

   <b>cmake_policy</b>
       Manage CMake Policy settings.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-policies.7.html">cmake-policies</a>(7)</u> manual for defined policies.

       As  CMake  evolves  it is sometimes necessary to change existing behavior in order to fix bugs or improve
       implementations of existing features.  The CMake Policy mechanism  is  designed  to  help  keep  existing
       projects  building  as  new versions of CMake introduce changes in behavior.  Each new policy (behavioral
       change) is given an identifier of the form <b>CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;</b> where <b>&lt;NNNN&gt;</b> is  an  integer  index.   Documentation
       associated  with each policy describes the <b>OLD</b> and <b>NEW</b> behavior and the reason the policy was introduced.
       Projects may set each policy to select the desired behavior.  When CMake needs to know which behavior  to
       use  it  checks  for  a setting specified by the project.  If no setting is available the <b>OLD</b> behavior is
       assumed and a warning is produced requesting that the policy be set.

   <b>Setting</b> <b>Policies</b> <b>by</b> <b>CMake</b> <b>Version</b>
       The <b>cmake_policy</b> command is used to set  policies  to  <b>OLD</b>  or  <b>NEW</b>  behavior.   While  setting  policies
       individually is supported, we encourage projects to set policies based on CMake versions:

       <b>cmake_policy(VERSION</b> <b>&lt;min&gt;[...&lt;max&gt;])</b>

       Added in version 3.12: The optional <b>&lt;max&gt;</b> version.

       <b>&lt;min&gt;</b> and the optional <b>&lt;max&gt;</b> are each CMake versions of the form <b>major.minor[.patch[.tweak]]</b>, and the <b>...</b>
       is  literal.  The <b>&lt;min&gt;</b> version must be at least <b>2.4</b> and at most the running version of CMake.  The <b>&lt;max&gt;</b>
       version, if specified, must be at least the <b>&lt;min&gt;</b> version but may exceed the running  version  of  CMake.
       If  the running version of CMake is older than 3.12, the extra <b>...</b> dots will be seen as version component
       separators, resulting in the <b>...&lt;max&gt;</b> part being ignored and preserving the pre-3.12 behavior  of  basing
       policies on <b>&lt;min&gt;</b>.

       This  specifies  that  the  current  CMake  code  is  written for the given range of CMake versions.  All
       policies known to the running version of CMake and introduced in  the  <b>&lt;min&gt;</b>  (or  <b>&lt;max&gt;</b>,  if  specified)
       version  or  earlier  will be set to use <b>NEW</b> behavior.  All policies introduced in later versions will be
       unset (unless the <u>CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;</u> variable sets a  default).   This  effectively  requests
       behavior  preferred  as  of  a given CMake version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about their new
       policies.

       Note that the <u>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)</u> command implicitly calls <b>cmake_policy(VERSION)</b> too.

       Changed in version 3.31: Compatibility with versions of CMake older than 3.10 is  deprecated.   Calls  to
       <u>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)</u>  or  <u>cmake_policy(VERSION)</u>  that  do  not  specify at least 3.10 as their
       policy version (optionally via <b>...&lt;max&gt;</b>) will produce a deprecation warning in CMake 3.31 and above.

       Changed in version 3.27: Compatibility with versions of CMake older than 3.5  is  deprecated.   Calls  to
       <u>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)</u> or <u>cmake_policy(VERSION)</u> that do not specify at least 3.5 as their policy
       version (optionally via <b>...&lt;max&gt;</b>) will produce a deprecation warning in CMake 3.27 and above.

       Changed  in version 3.19: Compatibility with versions of CMake older than 2.8.12 is deprecated.  Calls to
       <u>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)</u> or <u>cmake_policy(VERSION)</u> that do not specify at  least  2.8.12  as  their
       policy version (optionally via <b>...&lt;max&gt;</b>) will produce a deprecation warning in CMake 3.19 and above.

   <b>Setting</b> <b>Policies</b> <b>Explicitly</b>
       <b>cmake_policy(SET</b> <b>CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;</b> <b>NEW|OLD)</b>

       Tell  CMake to use the <b>OLD</b> or <b>NEW</b> behavior for a given policy.  Projects depending on the old behavior of
       a given policy may silence a policy warning by setting the policy state to <b>OLD</b>.   Alternatively  one  may
       fix the project to work with the new behavior and set the policy state to <b>NEW</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The  <b>OLD</b>  behavior  of  a policy is <u>deprecated</u> <u>by</u> <u>definition</u> and may be removed in a future version of
          CMake.

   <b>Checking</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Settings</b>
       <b>cmake_policy(GET</b> <b>CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;)</b>

       Check whether a given policy is set to <b>OLD</b> or <b>NEW</b> behavior.  The output <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> value will be  <b>OLD</b>  or
       <b>NEW</b> if the policy is set, and empty otherwise.

   <b>CMake</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Stack</b>
       CMake  keeps  policy settings on a stack, so changes made by the <b>cmake_policy</b> command affect only the top
       of the stack.  A new entry on the policy stack is managed automatically for each subdirectory to  protect
       its  parents  and  siblings.   CMake  also  manages  a  new  entry  for  scripts  loaded by <u>include()</u> and
       <u>find_package()</u> commands except when invoked with the <b>NO_POLICY_SCOPE</b> option (see  also  policy  <u>CMP0011</u>).
       The <b>cmake_policy</b> command provides an interface to manage custom entries on the policy stack:

       <b>cmake_policy(PUSH)</b>
              Create a new entry on the policy stack.

       <b>cmake_policy(POP)</b>
              Remove the last policy stack entry created with <b>cmake_policy(PUSH)</b>.

       Each  <b>PUSH</b>  must  have  a matching <b>POP</b> to erase any changes.  This is useful to make temporary changes to
       policy   settings.    Calls   to   the   <u>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)</u>,    <u>cmake_policy(VERSION)</u>,    or
       <u>cmake_policy(SET)</u> commands influence only the current top of the policy stack.

       Added  in  version 3.25: The <u>block(SCOPE_FOR</u> <u>POLICIES)</u> command offers a more flexible and more secure way
       to manage the policy stack. The pop action is done automatically when leaving the block scope,  so  there
       is no need to precede each <u>return()</u> with a call to <u>cmake_policy(POP)</u>.

          # stack management with cmake_policy()
          <a href="../manmy_func/function.my_func.html">function</a>(my_func)
            cmake_policy(PUSH)
            cmake_policy(SET ...)
            if (&lt;cond1&gt;)
              ...
              cmake_policy(POP)
              return()
            elseif(&lt;cond2&gt;)
              ...
              cmake_policy(POP)
              return()
            endif()
            ...
            cmake_policy(POP)
          endfunction()

          # stack management with block()/endblock()
          <a href="../manmy_func/function.my_func.html">function</a>(my_func)
            block(SCOPE_FOR POLICIES)
              cmake_policy(SET ...)
              if (&lt;cond1&gt;)
                ...
                return()
              elseif(&lt;cond2&gt;)
                ...
                return()
              endif()
              ...
            endblock()
          endfunction()

       Commands  created by the <u>function()</u> and <u>macro()</u> commands record policy settings when they are created and
       use the pre-record policies when they  are  invoked.   If  the  function  or  macro  implementation  sets
       policies,  the  changes  automatically  propagate  up through callers until they reach the closest nested
       policy stack entry.

       • <u>cmake_minimum_required()</u>

   <b>configure_file</b>
       Copy a file to another location and modify its contents.

          configure_file(&lt;input&gt; &lt;output&gt;
                         [NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS | USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS |
                          FILE_PERMISSIONS &lt;permissions&gt;...]
                         [COPYONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES] [@ONLY]
                         [NEWLINE_STYLE [UNIX|DOS|WIN32|LF|CRLF] ])

       Copies an <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> file to an <b>&lt;output&gt;</b> file while performing <u>transformations</u> of the input file content.

       If the input file is modified the build system will re-run CMake to re-configure the  file  and  generate
       the  build  system  again.   The generated file is modified and its timestamp updated on subsequent cmake
       runs only if its content is changed.

   <b>Options</b>
       The options are:

       <b>&lt;input&gt;</b>
              Path  to  the  input  file.   A  relative  path  is  treated  with  respect  to   the   value   of
              <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>.  The input path must be a file, not a directory.

       <b>&lt;output&gt;</b>
              Path  to  the  output  file or directory.  A relative path is treated with respect to the value of
              <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u>.  If the path names an existing directory the output file  is  placed  in
              that  directory  with  the  same  file  name as the input file.  If the path contains non-existent
              directories, they are created.

       <b>NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              Do not transfer the permissions of the input file to the output file.  The copied file permissions
              default to the standard 644 value (-rw-r--r--).

       <b>USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.20.

              Transfer the permissions of the input file to the  output  file.   This  is  already  the  default
              behavior  if  none  of  the  three  permissions-related keywords are given (<b>NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS</b>,
              <b>USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS</b> or <b>FILE_PERMISSIONS</b>).  The <b>USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS</b> keyword mostly serves  as
              a way of making the intended behavior clearer at the call site.

       <b>FILE_PERMISSIONS</b> <b>&lt;permissions&gt;...</b>
              Added in version 3.20.

              Ignore  the  input  file's  permissions  and  use  the specified <b>&lt;permissions&gt;</b> for the output file
              instead.

       <b>COPYONLY</b>
              Copy the file without replacing any variable references or other content.  This option may not  be
              used with <b>NEWLINE_STYLE</b>.

       <b>ESCAPE_QUOTES</b>
              Escape any substituted quotes with backslashes (C-style).

       <b>@ONLY</b>  Restrict  variable  replacement  to  references of the form <b>@VAR@</b>.  This is useful for configuring
              scripts that use <b>${VAR}</b> syntax.

       <b>NEWLINE_STYLE</b> <b>&lt;style&gt;</b>
              Specify the newline style for the output file.  Specify <b>UNIX</b> or <b>LF</b> for  <b>\n</b>  newlines,  or  specify
              <b>DOS</b>, <b>WIN32</b>, or <b>CRLF</b> for <b>\r\n</b> newlines.  This option may not be used with <b>COPYONLY</b>.

   <b>Transformations</b>
       <u>Variables</u>  referenced  in the input file content as <b>@VAR@</b>, <b>${VAR}</b>, <b>$CACHE{VAR}</b>, and <u>environment</u> <u>variables</u>
       referenced as <b>$ENV{VAR}</b>, will each be replaced with the current value  of  the  variable,  or  the  empty
       string if the variable is not defined.  Furthermore, input lines of the form

          #cmakedefine VAR ...

       will be replaced with either

          #define VAR ...

       or

          /* #undef VAR */

       depending  on  whether  <b>VAR</b>  is  set  in  CMake  to any value not considered a false constant by the <u>if()</u>
       command.  The "..." content on the line after the variable name, if any, is processed as above.

       Unlike lines of the form <b>#cmakedefine</b> <b>VAR</b> <b>...</b>, in lines of the form <b>#cmakedefine01</b> <b>VAR</b>, <b>VAR</b>  itself  will
       expand to <b>VAR</b> <b>0</b> or <b>VAR</b> <b>1</b> rather than being assigned the value <b>...</b>. Therefore, input lines of the form

          #cmakedefine01 VAR

       will be replaced with either

          #define VAR 0

       or

          #define VAR 1

       Input  lines of the form <b>#cmakedefine01</b> <b>VAR</b> <b>...</b> will expand as <b>#cmakedefine01</b> <b>VAR</b> <b>...</b> <b>0</b> or <b>#cmakedefine01</b>
       <b>VAR</b> <b>...</b> <b>1</b>, which may lead to undefined behavior.

       Added in version 3.10: The result lines (with the exception of the <b>#undef</b> comments) can be indented using
       spaces and/or tabs between the <b>#</b> character and the <b>cmakedefine</b> or <b>cmakedefine01</b>  words.  This  whitespace
       indentation will be preserved in the output lines:

          #  cmakedefine VAR
          #  cmakedefine01 VAR

       will be replaced, if <b>VAR</b> is defined, with

          #  define VAR
          #  define VAR 1

   <b>Example</b>
       Consider a source tree containing a <b>foo.h.in</b> file:

          #cmakedefine FOO_ENABLE
          #cmakedefine FOO_STRING "@FOO_STRING@"

       An adjacent <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> may use <b>configure_file</b> to configure the header:

          option(FOO_ENABLE "Enable Foo" ON)
          if(FOO_ENABLE)
            set(FOO_STRING "foo")
          endif()
          configure_file(foo.h.in foo.h @ONLY)

       This  creates  a  <b>foo.h</b> in the build directory corresponding to this source directory.  If the <b>FOO_ENABLE</b>
       option is on, the configured file will contain:

          #define FOO_ENABLE
          #define FOO_STRING "foo"

       Otherwise it will contain:

          /* #undef FOO_ENABLE */
          /* #undef FOO_STRING */

       One may then use the <u>target_include_directories()</u> command to specify the output directory as  an  include
       directory:

          target_include_directories(&lt;target&gt; [SYSTEM] &lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}")

       so that sources may include the header as <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;foo.h&gt;</b>.

       Added in version 3.2.

       Continue to the top of enclosing foreach or while loop.

          continue()

       The <b>continue()</b> command allows a cmake script to abort the rest of the current iteration of a <u>foreach()</u> or
       <u>while()</u> loop, and start at the top of the next iteration.

       See also the <u>break()</u> command.

   <b>else</b>

                          [COMMAND_ERROR_IS_FATAL &lt;ANY|LAST&gt;])

       Runs the given sequence of one or more commands.

       Commands are executed concurrently as a pipeline, with the standard output of each process piped  to  the
       standard input of the next.  A single standard error pipe is used for all processes.

       <b>execute_process</b>  runs  commands while CMake is configuring the project, prior to build system generation.
       Use the <u>add_custom_target()</u> and <u>add_custom_command()</u> commands to create custom commands that run at build
       time.

       Options:

       <b>COMMAND</b>
              A child process command line.

              CMake executes the child process using operating system APIs directly:

              • On POSIX platforms, the command line is passed to the child process in an <b>argv[]</b> style array.

              • On Windows platforms, the command line is encoded as a string such that  child  processes  using
                <b>CommandLineToArgvW</b> will decode the original arguments.

              No intermediate shell is used, so shell operators such as <b>&gt;</b> are treated as normal arguments.  (Use
              the <b>INPUT_*</b>, <b>OUTPUT_*</b>, and <b>ERROR_*</b> options to redirect stdin, stdout, and stderr.)

              For  <b>sequential</b>  <b>execution</b>  of  multiple  commands  use multiple <b>execute_process</b> calls each with a
              single <b>COMMAND</b> argument.

       <b>WORKING_DIRECTORY</b>
              The named directory will be set as the current working directory of the child processes.

       <b>TIMEOUT</b>
              After the specified number of seconds (fractions allowed), all unfinished child processes will  be
              terminated, and the <b>RESULT_VARIABLE</b> will be set to a string mentioning the "timeout".

       <b>RESULT_VARIABLE</b>
              The  variable  will  be  set to contain the result of last child process.  This will be an integer
              return code from the last child or a string describing an error condition.

       <b>RESULTS_VARIABLE</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.10.

              The variable will be set to contain the result of all processes as a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u>,  in
              order  of  the  given  <b>COMMAND</b>  arguments.   Each  entry  will  be an integer return code from the
              corresponding child or a string describing an error condition.

       <b>INPUT_FILE</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> is attached to the standard input pipe of the <u>first</u> <b>COMMAND</b> process.

       <b>OUTPUT_FILE</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> is attached to the standard output pipe of the <u>last</u> <b>COMMAND</b> process.

       <b>ERROR_FILE</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> is attached to the standard error pipe of <u>all</u> <b>COMMAND</b> processes.

       Added in version 3.3: If the same <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> is named for both <b>OUTPUT_FILE</b> and <b>ERROR_FILE</b>  then  it  will  be
       used for both standard output and standard error pipes.

       <b>OUTPUT_QUIET,</b> <b>ERROR_QUIET</b>
              The  standard  output on <b>OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> or standard error on <b>ERROR_VARIABLE</b> are not connected (no
              variable content).  The  <b>*_FILE</b> and <b>ECHO_*_VARIABLE</b> options are not affected.

       <b>OUTPUT_VARIABLE,</b> <b>ERROR_VARIABLE</b>
              The variable named will be set with the contents of the standard output and standard error  pipes,
              respectively.   If  the  same  variable is named for both pipes their output will be merged in the
              order produced.

       <b>ECHO_OUTPUT_VARIABLE,</b> <b>ECHO_ERROR_VARIABLE</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              The standard output or standard  error  will  not  be  exclusively  redirected  to  the  specified
              variables.

              The  output  will  be  duplicated  into  the  specified variables and also onto standard output or
              standard error analogous to the <b>tee</b> Unix command.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          If more than one <b>OUTPUT_*</b> or <b>ERROR_*</b> option  is  given  for  the  same  pipe  the  precedence  is  <u>not</u>
          <u>specified</u>.   If  no  <b>OUTPUT_*</b>  or  <b>ERROR_*</b>  options  are  given  the  output  will  be shared with the
          corresponding pipes of the CMake process itself.

       <b>COMMAND_ECHO</b> <b>&lt;where&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              The command being run will be echo'ed to <b>&lt;where&gt;</b> with <b>&lt;where&gt;</b> being set to one of  <b>STDERR</b>,  <b>STDOUT</b>
              or  <b>NONE</b>.   See  the  <u>CMAKE_EXECUTE_PROCESS_COMMAND_ECHO</u> variable for a way to control the default
              behavior when this option is not present.

       <b>ENCODING</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.8.

              On Windows, the encoding that is used to  decode  output  from  the  process.   Ignored  on  other
              platforms.  Valid encoding names are:

              <b>NONE</b>   Perform  no  decoding.   This assumes that the process output is encoded in the same way as
                     CMake's internal encoding (UTF-8).

                     This was the default in CMake 3.14 and older.

              <b>AUTO</b>   Use the current active console's codepage or if that isn't available then use ANSI.

                     This was the default in CMake 3.15 through 3.30.

              <b>ANSI</b>   Use the ANSI codepage.

              <b>OEM</b>    Use the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) code page.

              <b>UTF-8</b>  Added in version 3.11.

                     Use the UTF-8 codepage.

                     This is the default since CMake 3.31.  See policy <u>CMP0176</u>.

              <b>UTF8</b>   Use the UTF-8 codepage.  Use of this name is discouraged in favor of <b>UTF-8</b> to match  the  ‐
                     <u>UTF-8</u> <u>RFC</u> naming convention.

       <b>COMMAND_ERROR_IS_FATAL</b> <b>&lt;ANY|LAST&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              The option following <b>COMMAND_ERROR_IS_FATAL</b> determines the behavior when an error is encountered:
                 <b>ANY</b>  If  any  of the commands in the list of commands fail, the <b>execute_process()</b> command halts
                 with an error.

                 <b>LAST</b> If the last command in the list of commands fails,  the  <b>execute_process()</b>  command  halts
                 with an error.  Commands earlier in the list will not cause a fatal error.

   <b>file</b>
       File manipulation command.

       This command is dedicated to file and path manipulation requiring access to the filesystem.

       For other path manipulation, handling only syntactic aspects, have a look at <u>cmake_path()</u> command.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The sub-commands <u>RELATIVE_PATH</u>, <u>TO_CMAKE_PATH</u> and <u>TO_NATIVE_PATH</u> has been superseded, respectively, by
          sub-commands  <u>RELATIVE_PATH</u>,  <u>CONVERT</u>  <u>...</u>  <u>TO_CMAKE_PATH_LIST</u>  and <u>CONVERT</u> <u>...</u> <u>TO_NATIVE_PATH_LIST</u> of
          <u>cmake_path()</u> command.

   <b>Reading</b>
       <b>file(READ</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> <b>[OFFSET</b> <b>&lt;offset&gt;]</b> <b>[LIMIT</b> <b>&lt;max-in&gt;]</b> <b>[HEX])</b>
              Read content from a file called <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> and store it in a <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.   Optionally  start  from
              the given <b>&lt;offset&gt;</b> and read at most <b>&lt;max-in&gt;</b> bytes.  The <b>HEX</b> option causes data to be converted to
              a hexadecimal representation (useful for binary data).  If the <b>HEX</b> option is specified, letters in
              the output (<b>a</b> through <b>f</b>) are in lowercase.

       <b>file(STRINGS</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> <b>&lt;options&gt;...)</b>
              Parse a list of ASCII strings from <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> and store it in <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.  Binary data in the file
              are ignored.  Carriage return (<b>\r</b>, CR) characters are ignored.  The options are:

                 <b>LENGTH_MAXIMUM</b> <b>&lt;max-len&gt;</b>
                        Consider only strings of at most a given length.

                 <b>LENGTH_MINIMUM</b> <b>&lt;min-len&gt;</b>
                        Consider only strings of at least a given length.

                 <b>LIMIT_COUNT</b> <b>&lt;max-num&gt;</b>
                        Limit the number of distinct strings to be extracted.

                 <b>LIMIT_INPUT</b> <b>&lt;max-in&gt;</b>
                        Limit the number of input bytes to read from the file.

                 <b>LIMIT_OUTPUT</b> <b>&lt;max-out&gt;</b>
                        Limit the number of total bytes to store in the <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.

                 <b>NEWLINE_CONSUME</b>
                        Treat  newline  characters  (<b>\n</b>, LF) as part of string content instead of terminating at
                        them.

                 <b>NO_HEX_CONVERSION</b>
                        Intel Hex and Motorola S-record  files  are  automatically  converted  to  binary  while
                        reading unless this option is given.

                 <b>REGEX</b> <b>&lt;regex&gt;</b>
                        Consider  only  strings  that  match  the  given  regular expression, as described under
                        <u>string(REGEX)</u>.

                        Changed in version 3.29: Capture groups from the last match in the file  are  stored  in
                        <u>CMAKE_MATCH_&lt;n&gt;</u>, similar to <u>string(REGEX</u> <u>MATCHALL)</u>.  See policy <u>CMP0159</u>.

                 <b>ENCODING</b> <b>&lt;encoding-type&gt;</b>
                        Added in version 3.1.

                        Consider  strings  of  a  given  encoding.   Currently  supported  encodings are: <b>UTF-8</b>,
                        <b>UTF-16LE</b>, <b>UTF-16BE</b>, <b>UTF-32LE</b>, <b>UTF-32BE</b>.  If the <b>ENCODING</b> option is not provided and  the
                        file  has  a  Byte Order Mark, the <b>ENCODING</b> option will be defaulted to respect the Byte
                        Order Mark.

              Added in version 3.2: Added the <b>UTF-16LE</b>, <b>UTF-16BE</b>, <b>UTF-32LE</b>, <b>UTF-32BE</b> encodings.

              For example, the code

                 file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)

              stores a list in the variable <b>myfile</b> in which each item is a line from the input file.

       <b>file(&lt;HASH&gt;</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;)</b>
              Compute a cryptographic hash of the content of <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> and  store  it  in  a  <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.   The
              supported <b>&lt;HASH&gt;</b> algorithm names are those listed by the <u>string(&lt;HASH&gt;)</u> command.

       <b>file(TIMESTAMP</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;format&gt;]</b> <b>[UTC])</b>
              Compute a string representation of the modification time of <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> and store it in <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.
              Should the command be unable to obtain a timestamp variable will be set to the empty string ("").

              See the <u>string(TIMESTAMP)</u> command for documentation of the <b>&lt;format&gt;</b> and <b>UTC</b> options.

   <b>Writing</b>
       <b>file(WRITE</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>&lt;content&gt;...)</b>

       <b>file(APPEND</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>&lt;content&gt;...)</b>
              Write  <b>&lt;content&gt;</b>  into  a file called <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>.  If the file does not exist, it will be created.
              If the file already exists, <b>WRITE</b> mode will overwrite it and <b>APPEND</b> mode will append to  the  end.
              Any directories in the path specified by <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> that do not exist will be created.

              If  the  file  is a build input, use the <u>configure_file()</u> command to update the file only when its
              content changes.

       <b>file(TOUCH</b> <b>&lt;files&gt;...)</b>

       <b>file(TOUCH_NOCREATE</b> <b>&lt;files&gt;...)</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              Create a file with no content if it does not yet exist. If the file  already  exists,  its  access
              and/or modification will be updated to the time when the function call is executed.

              Use  <b>TOUCH_NOCREATE</b>  to  touch a file if it exists but not create it.  If a file does not exist it
              will be silently ignored.

              With <b>TOUCH</b> and <b>TOUCH_NOCREATE</b>, the contents of an existing file will not be modified.

              Changed in version 3.30: <b>&lt;files&gt;</b> can be an empty list. CMake 3.29 and earlier  required  at  least
              one file to be given.

       <b>file(GENERATE</b> <b>[...])</b>
              Generate  an  output  file  for each build configuration supported by the current <u>CMake</u> <u>Generator</u>.
              Evaluate <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> from the input content to produce the output content.

                 file(GENERATE OUTPUT &lt;output-file&gt;
                      &lt;INPUT &lt;input-file&gt;|CONTENT &lt;content&gt;&gt;
                      [CONDITION &lt;expression&gt;] [TARGET &lt;target&gt;]
                      [NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS | USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS |
                       FILE_PERMISSIONS &lt;permissions&gt;...]
                      [NEWLINE_STYLE [UNIX|DOS|WIN32|LF|CRLF] ])

              The options are:

                 <b>CONDITION</b> <b>&lt;condition&gt;</b>
                        Generate the output file for a particular configuration only if the condition  is  true.
                        The condition must be either <b>0</b> or <b>1</b> after evaluating generator expressions.

                 <b>CONTENT</b> <b>&lt;content&gt;</b>
                        Use the content given explicitly as input.

                 <b>INPUT</b> <b>&lt;input-file&gt;</b>
                        Use the content from a given file as input.

                        Changed  in  version  3.10:  A  relative  path  is  treated with respect to the value of
                        <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>.  See policy <u>CMP0070</u>.

                 <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>&lt;output-file&gt;</b>
                        Specify the output file name to generate.  Use generator expressions such  as  <u>$&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>
                        to  specify  a  configuration-specific  output  file  name.  Multiple configurations may
                        generate the same output file only if the generated content  is  identical.   Otherwise,
                        the <b>&lt;output-file&gt;</b> must evaluate to an unique name for each configuration.

                        Changed  in  version  3.10:  A relative path (after evaluating generator expressions) is
                        treated with respect to the value of <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u>.  See policy <u>CMP0070</u>.

                 <b>TARGET</b> <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>
                        Added in version 3.19.

                        Specify which target to use when evaluating generator expressions that require a  target
                        for evaluation (e.g.  <u>$&lt;COMPILE_FEATURES:...&gt;</u>, <u>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt;</u>).

                 <b>NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS</b>
                        Added in version 3.20.

                        The generated file permissions default to the standard 644 value (-rw-r--r--).

                 <b>USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS</b>
                        Added in version 3.20.

                        Transfer  the  file permissions of the <b>INPUT</b> file to the generated file. This is already
                        the default behavior if  none  of  the  three  permissions-related  keywords  are  given
                        (<b>NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS</b>,     <b>USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS</b>     or     <b>FILE_PERMISSIONS</b>).     The
                        <b>USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS</b> keyword mostly serves as a way of making  the  intended  behavior
                        clearer at the call site. It is an error to specify this option without <b>INPUT</b>.

                 <b>FILE_PERMISSIONS</b> <b>&lt;permissions&gt;...</b>
                        Added in version 3.20.

                        Use the specified permissions for the generated file.

                 <b>NEWLINE_STYLE</b> <b>&lt;style&gt;</b>
                        Added in version 3.20.

                        Specify  the  newline style for the generated file.  Specify <b>UNIX</b> or <b>LF</b> for <b>\n</b> newlines,
                        or specify <b>DOS</b>, <b>WIN32</b>, or <b>CRLF</b> for <b>\r\n</b> newlines.

              Exactly one <b>CONTENT</b> or <b>INPUT</b> option must be given.  A specific <b>OUTPUT</b> file may be named by at most
              one invocation of <b>file(GENERATE)</b>.  Generated files are modified and  their  timestamp  updated  on
              subsequent cmake runs only if their content is changed.

              Note  also  that  <b>file(GENERATE)</b>  does  not create the output file until the generation phase. The
              output file will not yet have been written when the <b>file(GENERATE)</b> command returns, it is  written
              only after processing all of a project's <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files.

       <b>file(CONFIGURE</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>&lt;output-file&gt;</b> <b>CONTENT</b> <b>&lt;content&gt;</b> <b>[ESCAPE_QUOTES]</b> <b>[@ONLY]</b>
       <b>[NEWLINE_STYLE</b> <b>[UNIX|DOS|WIN32|LF|CRLF]</b> <b>])</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              Generate an output file using the input given by <b>CONTENT</b> and substitute variable values referenced
              as   <b>@VAR@</b>   or  <b>${VAR}</b>  contained  therein.  The  substitution  rules  behave  the  same  as  the
              <u>configure_file()</u> command.  In order to match <u>configure_file()</u>'s  behavior,  generator  expressions
              are  not  supported  for  both  <b>OUTPUT</b>  and  <b>CONTENT</b>, and the output file is only modified and its
              timestamp updated if the content is changed or the file previously didn't exist.

              The arguments are:

                 <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>&lt;output-file&gt;</b>
                        Specify the output file name to generate. A relative path is treated with respect to the
                        value  of  <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u>.    <b>&lt;output-file&gt;</b>   does   not   support   generator
                        expressions.

                 <b>CONTENT</b> <b>&lt;content&gt;</b>
                        Use  the  content  given  explicitly  as  input.   <b>&lt;content&gt;</b>  does not support generator
                        expressions.

                 <b>ESCAPE_QUOTES</b>
                        Escape any substituted quotes with backslashes (C-style).

                 <b>@ONLY</b>  Restrict variable replacement to references of the  form  <b>@VAR@</b>.   This  is  useful  for
                        configuring scripts that use <b>${VAR}</b> syntax.

                 <b>NEWLINE_STYLE</b> <b>&lt;style&gt;</b>
                        Specify  the  newline style for the output file.  Specify <b>UNIX</b> or <b>LF</b> for <b>\n</b> newlines, or
                        specify <b>DOS</b>, <b>WIN32</b>, or <b>CRLF</b> for <b>\r\n</b> newlines.

   <b>Filesystem</b>
       <b>file(GLOB</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> <b>[LIST_DIRECTORIES</b> <b>true|false]</b> <b>[RELATIVE</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;]</b> <b>[CONFIGURE_DEPENDS]</b>
       <b>&lt;globbing-expressions&gt;...)</b>

       <b>file(GLOB_RECURSE</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> <b>[FOLLOW_SYMLINKS]</b> <b>[LIST_DIRECTORIES</b> <b>true|false]</b> <b>[RELATIVE</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;]</b>
       <b>[CONFIGURE_DEPENDS]</b> <b>&lt;globbing-expressions&gt;...)</b>
              Generate a list of files that match the <b>&lt;globbing-expressions&gt;</b> and store it into  the  <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.
              Globbing  expressions  are  similar to regular expressions, but much simpler.  If <b>RELATIVE</b> flag is
              specified, the results will be returned as relative paths to the given path.

              Changed in version 3.6: The results will be ordered lexicographically.

              On Windows  and  macOS,  globbing  is  case-insensitive  even  if  the  underlying  filesystem  is
              case-sensitive  (both  filenames  and  globbing  expressions  are  converted  to  lowercase before
              matching).  On other platforms, globbing is case-sensitive.

              Added in version 3.3: By default <b>GLOB</b> lists directories. Directories are omitted in the result  if
              <b>LIST_DIRECTORIES</b> is set to false.

              Added  in  version  3.12:  If the <b>CONFIGURE_DEPENDS</b> flag is specified, CMake will add logic to the
              main build system check target to rerun the flagged <b>GLOB</b> commands at build time.  If  any  of  the
              outputs change, CMake will regenerate the build system.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 We  do not recommend using GLOB to collect a list of source files from your source tree.  If no
                 CMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is added or removed then the generated  build  system
                 cannot  know when to ask CMake to regenerate.  The <b>CONFIGURE_DEPENDS</b> flag may not work reliably
                 on all generators, or if a new generator is  added  in  the  future  that  cannot  support  it,
                 projects  using  it  will  be stuck. Even if <b>CONFIGURE_DEPENDS</b> works reliably, there is still a
                 cost to perform the check on every rebuild.

              Examples of globbing expressions include:
                                   ┌────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────┐
                                   │ <b>*.cxx</b>      │ match all files with extension <b>cxx</b>    │

                                   └────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────┘

              The  <b>GLOB_RECURSE</b> mode will traverse all the subdirectories of the matched directory and match the
              files.  Subdirectories that are symlinks are only traversed if <b>FOLLOW_SYMLINKS</b> is given or  policy
              <u>CMP0009</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b>.

              Added  in  version  3.3:  By  default  <b>GLOB_RECURSE</b>  omits  directories  from result list. Setting
              <b>LIST_DIRECTORIES</b> to true adds directories to result list.  If <b>FOLLOW_SYMLINKS</b> is given  or  policy
              <u>CMP0009</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b> then <b>LIST_DIRECTORIES</b> treats symlinks as directories.

              Examples of recursive globbing include:

       <b>file(MAKE_DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;directories&gt;...</b> <b>[RESULT</b> <b>&lt;result&gt;])</b>
              Create the given directories and their parents as needed.

              The options are:

                 <b>RESULT</b> <b>&lt;result&gt;</b>
                        Added in version 3.31.

                        Set <b>&lt;result&gt;</b> variable to <b>0</b> on success or an error message otherwise. If  <b>RESULT</b>  is  not
                        specified and the operation fails, an error is emitted.

              Changed  in  version  3.30: <b>&lt;directories&gt;</b> can be an empty list. CMake 3.29 and earlier required at
              least one directory to be given.

       <b>file(REMOVE</b> <b>&lt;files&gt;...)</b>

       <b>file(REMOVE_RECURSE</b> <b>&lt;files&gt;...)</b>
              Remove the given files.  The <b>REMOVE_RECURSE</b> mode will remove  the  given  files  and  directories,
              including  non-empty  directories.  No  error is emitted if a given file does not exist.  Relative
              input paths are evaluated with respect to the current source directory.

              Changed in version 3.15: Empty input paths are ignored with a warning.  Previous versions of CMake
              interpreted empty strings as a relative path with respect to the current directory and removed its
              contents.

       <b>file(RENAME</b> <b>&lt;oldname&gt;</b> <b>&lt;newname&gt;</b> <b>[RESULT</b> <b>&lt;result&gt;]</b> <b>[NO_REPLACE])</b>
              Move a file  or  directory  within  a  filesystem  from  <b>&lt;oldname&gt;</b>  to  <b>&lt;newname&gt;</b>,  replacing  the
              destination atomically.

              The options are:

                 <b>RESULT</b> <b>&lt;result&gt;</b>
                        Added in version 3.21.

                        Set  <b>&lt;result&gt;</b>  variable  to <b>0</b> on success or an error message otherwise. If <b>RESULT</b> is not
                        specified and the operation fails, an error is emitted.

                 <b>NO_REPLACE</b>
                        Added in version 3.21.

                        If the <b>&lt;newname&gt;</b> path already exists, do not replace it.  If <b>RESULT</b>  <b>&lt;result&gt;</b>  is  used,
                        the result variable will be set to <b>NO_REPLACE</b>.  Otherwise, an error is emitted.

       <b>file(COPY_FILE</b> <b>&lt;oldname&gt;</b> <b>&lt;newname&gt;</b> <b>[RESULT</b> <b>&lt;result&gt;]</b> <b>[ONLY_IF_DIFFERENT]</b> <b>[INPUT_MAY_BE_RECENT])</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              Copy  a  file from <b>&lt;oldname&gt;</b> to <b>&lt;newname&gt;</b>. Directories are not supported. Symlinks are ignored and
              <b>&lt;oldfile&gt;</b>'s content is read and written to <b>&lt;newname&gt;</b> as a new file.

              The options are:

                 <b>RESULT</b> <b>&lt;result&gt;</b>
                        Set <b>&lt;result&gt;</b> variable to <b>0</b> on success or an error message otherwise.  If <b>RESULT</b>  is  not
                        specified and the operation fails, an error is emitted.

                 <b>ONLY_IF_DIFFERENT</b>
                        If  the  <b>&lt;newname&gt;</b>  path  already  exists,  do not replace it if the file's contents are
                        already the same as <b>&lt;oldname&gt;</b> (this avoids updating <b>&lt;newname&gt;</b>'s timestamp).

                 <b>INPUT_MAY_BE_RECENT</b>
                        Added in version 3.26.

                        Tell CMake that the input file may have been recently created.  This is meaningful  only
                        on  Windows,  where  files  may be inaccessible for a short time after they are created.
                        With this option, if permission is denied, CMake will retry  reading  the  input  a  few
                        times.

              This sub-command has some similarities to <u>configure_file()</u> with the <b>COPYONLY</b> option.  An important
              difference  is  that  <u>configure_file()</u>  creates  a dependency on the source file, so CMake will be
              re-run if it changes. The <b>file(COPY_FILE)</b> sub-command does not create such a dependency.

              See also the <u>file(COPY)</u> sub-command just below which provides further file-copying capabilities.

       <b>file(COPY</b> <b>[...])</b>

       <b>file(INSTALL</b> <b>[...])</b>
              The <b>COPY</b> signature copies files, directories, and symlinks  to  a  destination  folder.   Relative
              input paths are evaluated with respect to the current source directory, and a relative destination
              is  evaluated  with  respect  to  the  current  build  directory.   Copying  preserves  input file
              timestamps, and optimizes out a file if it exists at the  destination  with  the  same  timestamp.
              Copying preserves input permissions unless explicit permissions or <b>NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS</b> are given
              (default is <b>USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS</b>).

                 file(&lt;COPY|INSTALL&gt; &lt;files&gt;... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
                      [NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS | USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS]
                      [FILE_PERMISSIONS &lt;permissions&gt;...]
                      [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS &lt;permissions&gt;...]
                      [FOLLOW_SYMLINK_CHAIN]
                      [FILES_MATCHING]
                      [[PATTERN &lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX &lt;regex&gt;]
                       [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS &lt;permissions&gt;...]] [...])

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 For  a  simple file copying operation, the <u>file(COPY_FILE)</u> sub-command just above may be easier
                 to use.

              Added in version 3.15: If <b>FOLLOW_SYMLINK_CHAIN</b> is specified, <b>COPY</b>  will  recursively  resolve  the
              symlinks at the paths given until a real file is found, and install a corresponding symlink in the
              destination  for  each symlink encountered.  For each symlink that is installed, the resolution is
              stripped of the directory, leaving only the filename, meaning that the new  symlink  points  to  a
              file  in  the  same  directory  as the symlink. This feature is useful on some Unix systems, where
              libraries are installed as a chain of symlinks with version numbers, with less  specific  versions
              pointing  to  more  specific versions. <b>FOLLOW_SYMLINK_CHAIN</b> will install all of these symlinks and
              the library itself into the  destination  directory.  For  example,  if  you  have  the  following
              directory structure:

                 • <b>/opt/foo/lib/libfoo.so.1.2.3</b>

                 • <b>/opt/foo/lib/libfoo.so.1.2</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>libfoo.so.1.2.3</b>

                 • <b>/opt/foo/lib/libfoo.so.1</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>libfoo.so.1.2</b>

                 • <b>/opt/foo/lib/libfoo.so</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>libfoo.so.1</b>

              and you do:

                 file(COPY /opt/foo/lib/libfoo.so DESTINATION lib FOLLOW_SYMLINK_CHAIN)

              This will install all of the symlinks and <b>libfoo.so.1.2.3</b> itself into <b>lib</b>.

              See  the  <u>install(DIRECTORY)</u>  command  for  documentation of permissions, <b>FILES_MATCHING</b>, <b>PATTERN</b>,
              <b>REGEX</b>, and <b>EXCLUDE</b> options.  Copying directories preserves the structure of their content even  if
              options are used to select a subset of files.

              The   <b>INSTALL</b>   signature   differs   slightly   from   <b>COPY</b>:   it  prints  status  messages,  and
              <b>NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS</b> is default. Installation scripts generated by the <u>install()</u> command use this
              signature (with some undocumented options for internal use).

              Changed in version 3.22: The environment variable  <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE</u>  can  override  the  default
              copying behavior of <u>file(INSTALL)</u>.

       <b>file(SIZE</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;)</b>
              Added in version 3.14.

              Determine the file size of the <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> and put the result in <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> variable. Requires that
              <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> is a valid path pointing to a file and is readable.

       <b>file(READ_SYMLINK</b> <b>&lt;linkname&gt;</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;)</b>
              Added in version 3.14.

              Query  the  symlink  <b>&lt;linkname&gt;</b>  and  stores  the  path it points to in the result <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.  If
              <b>&lt;linkname&gt;</b> does not exist or is not a symlink, CMake issues a fatal error.

              Note that this command returns the raw symlink path and does not resolve  a  relative  path.   The
              following is an example of how to ensure that an absolute path is obtained:

                 set(linkname "/path/to/foo.sym")
                 file(READ_SYMLINK "${linkname}" result)
                 if(NOT IS_ABSOLUTE "${result}")
                   get_filename_component(dir "${linkname}" DIRECTORY)
                   set(result "${dir}/${result}")
                 endif()

       <b>file(CREATE_LINK</b> <b>&lt;original&gt;</b> <b>&lt;linkname&gt;</b> <b>[RESULT</b> <b>&lt;result&gt;]</b> <b>[COPY_ON_ERROR]</b> <b>[SYMBOLIC])</b>
              Added in version 3.14.

              Create  a  link  <b>&lt;linkname&gt;</b>  that  points  to  <b>&lt;original&gt;</b>.  It will be a hard link by default, but
              providing the <b>SYMBOLIC</b> option results in  a  symbolic  link  instead.   Hard  links  require  that
              <b>original</b>  exists  and  is  a  file,  not  a  directory.   If <b>&lt;linkname&gt;</b> already exists, it will be
              overwritten.

              The <b>&lt;result&gt;</b> variable, if specified, receives the status of the operation.  It is set  to  <b>0</b>  upon
              success  or  an  error  message  otherwise.  If <b>RESULT</b> is not specified and the operation fails, a
              fatal error is emitted.

              Specifying <b>COPY_ON_ERROR</b> enables copying the file as a fallback if creating the  link  fails.   It
              can  be useful for handling situations such as <b>&lt;original&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;linkname&gt;</b> being on different drives
              or mount points, which would make them unable to support a hard link.

       <b>file(CHMOD</b> <b>&lt;files&gt;...</b> <b>&lt;directories&gt;...</b> <b>[PERMISSIONS</b> <b>&lt;permissions&gt;...]</b> <b>[FILE_PERMISSIONS</b> <b>&lt;permissions&gt;...]</b>
       <b>[DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS</b> <b>&lt;permissions&gt;...])</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              Set the permissions for the <b>&lt;files&gt;...</b> and  <b>&lt;directories&gt;...</b>   specified.  Valid  permissions  are
              <b>OWNER_READ</b>,   <b>OWNER_WRITE</b>,  <b>OWNER_EXECUTE</b>,  <b>GROUP_READ</b>,  <b>GROUP_WRITE</b>,  <b>GROUP_EXECUTE</b>,  <b>WORLD_READ</b>,
              <b>WORLD_WRITE</b>, <b>WORLD_EXECUTE</b>, <b>SETUID</b>, <b>SETGID</b>.

              Valid combination of keywords are:

                 <b>PERMISSIONS</b>
                        All items are changed.

                 <b>FILE_PERMISSIONS</b>
                        Only files are changed.

                 <b>DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS</b>
                        Only directories are changed.

                 <b>PERMISSIONS</b> <b>and</b> <b>FILE_PERMISSIONS</b>
                        <b>FILE_PERMISSIONS</b> overrides <b>PERMISSIONS</b> for files.

                 <b>PERMISSIONS</b> <b>and</b> <b>DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS</b>
                        <b>DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS</b> overrides <b>PERMISSIONS</b> for directories.

                 <b>FILE_PERMISSIONS</b> <b>and</b> <b>DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS</b>
                        Use <b>FILE_PERMISSIONS</b> for files and <b>DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS</b> for directories.

       <b>file(CHMOD_RECURSE</b> <b>&lt;files&gt;...</b> <b>&lt;directories&gt;...</b> <b>[PERMISSIONS</b> <b>&lt;permissions&gt;...]</b>
       <b>[FILE_PERMISSIONS</b> <b>&lt;permissions&gt;...]</b> <b>[DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS</b> <b>&lt;permissions&gt;...])</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              Same as <u>CHMOD</u>, but change the permissions of files and directories present in the <b>&lt;directories&gt;...</b>
              recursively.

   <b>Path</b> <b>Conversion</b>
       <b>file(REAL_PATH</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> <b>&lt;out-var&gt;</b> <b>[BASE_DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;]</b> <b>[EXPAND_TILDE])</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              Compute the absolute path to an existing file or directory with symlinks  resolved.   The  options
              are:

                 <b>BASE_DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                        If  the  provided  <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> is a relative path, it is evaluated relative to the given base
                        directory <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>. If no base directory is provided, the default base  directory  will  be
                        <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>.

                 <b>EXPAND_TILDE</b>
                        Added in version 3.21.

                        If  the  <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>  is <b>~</b> or starts with <b>~/</b>, the <b>~</b> is replaced by the user's home directory.
                        The path to the home directory is obtained from environment variables.  On Windows,  the
                        <b>USERPROFILE</b>  environment variable is used, falling back to the <b>HOME</b> environment variable
                        if <b>USERPROFILE</b> is not defined.  On all other platforms, only <b>HOME</b> is used.

              Changed in version 3.28: All symlinks are resolved before collapsing <b>../</b> components.   See  policy
              <u>CMP0152</u>.

       <b>file(RELATIVE_PATH</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;)</b>
              Compute the relative path from a <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b> to a <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> and store it in the <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.

       <b>file(TO_CMAKE_PATH</b> <b>"&lt;path&gt;"</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;)</b>

       <b>file(TO_NATIVE_PATH</b> <b>"&lt;path&gt;"</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;)</b>
              The  <b>TO_CMAKE_PATH</b> mode converts a native <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> into a cmake-style path with forward-slashes (<b>/</b>).
              The input can be a single path or a system search path like <b>$ENV{PATH}</b>.  A  search  path  will  be
              converted to a cmake-style list separated by <b>;</b> characters.

              The  <b>TO_NATIVE_PATH</b>  mode  converts a cmake-style <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> into a native path with platform-specific
              slashes (<b>\</b> on Windows hosts and <b>/</b> elsewhere).

              Always use double quotes around the <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> to be sure it is treated as a single argument  to  this
              command.

   <b>Transfer</b>
       <b>file(DOWNLOAD</b> <b>&lt;url&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;file&gt;]</b> <b>&lt;options&gt;...)</b>

       <b>file(UPLOAD</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> <b>&lt;url&gt;</b> <b>&lt;options&gt;...)</b>
              The  <b>DOWNLOAD</b>  subcommand  downloads the given <b>&lt;url&gt;</b> to a local <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>.  The <b>UPLOAD</b> mode uploads a
              local <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> to a given <b>&lt;url&gt;</b>.

              Added in version 3.19: If <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> is not specified for <b>file(DOWNLOAD)</b>, the file is not saved.  This
              can  be  useful  if  you  want  to know if a file can be downloaded (for example, to check that it
              exists) without actually saving it anywhere.

              Options to both <b>DOWNLOAD</b> and <b>UPLOAD</b> are:

                 <b>INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
                        Terminate the operation after a period of inactivity.

                 <b>LOG</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>
                        Store a human-readable log of the operation in a variable.

                 <b>SHOW_PROGRESS</b>
                        Print progress information as status messages until the operation is complete.

                 <b>STATUS</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>
                        Store the resulting status of the operation in a variable.  The status is a <b>;</b>  separated
                        list  of length 2.  The first element is the numeric return value for the operation, and
                        the second element is a string value for the error.  A <b>0</b> numeric error means no error in
                        the operation.

                 <b>TIMEOUT</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
                        Terminate the operation after a given total time has elapsed.

                 <b>USERPWD</b> <b>&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;</b>
                        Added in version 3.7.

                        Set username and password for operation.

                 <b>HTTPHEADER</b> <b>&lt;HTTP-header&gt;</b>
                        Added in version 3.7.

                        HTTP header for <b>DOWNLOAD</b> and <b>UPLOAD</b> operations. <b>HTTPHEADER</b> can be repeated for  multiple
                        options:

                            file(DOWNLOAD &lt;url&gt;
                                 HTTPHEADER "Authorization: Bearer &lt;auth-token&gt;"
                                 HTTPHEADER "UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0")

                 <b>NETRC</b> <b>&lt;level&gt;</b>
                        Added in version 3.11.

                        Specify  whether  the  .netrc  file  is to be used for operation.  If this option is not
                        specified, the value of the <u>CMAKE_NETRC</u> variable will be used instead.

                        Valid levels are:

                            <b>IGNORED</b>
                                   The .netrc file is ignored.  This is the default.

                            <b>OPTIONAL</b>
                                   The .netrc file is optional, and information in the URL  is  preferred.   The
                                   file  will  be scanned to find which ever information is not specified in the
                                   URL.

                            <b>REQUIRED</b>
                                   The .netrc file is required, and information in the URL is ignored.

                 <b>NETRC_FILE</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
                        Added in version 3.11.

                        Specify an alternative .netrc file to the one in your home directory, if the <b>NETRC</b> level
                        is  <b>OPTIONAL</b>  or  <b>REQUIRED</b>.  If  this  option  is  not  specified,  the  value  of   the
                        <u>CMAKE_NETRC_FILE</u> variable will be used instead.

                 <b>TLS_VERSION</b> <b>&lt;min&gt;</b>
                        Added in version 3.30.

                        Specify  minimum  TLS  version  for <b>https://</b> URLs.  If this option is not specified, the
                        value of the <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERSION</u> variable or <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERSION</u> environment  variable  will
                        be used instead.  See <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERSION</u> for allowed values.

                        Changed  in  version  3.31:  The default is TLS 1.2.  Previously, no minimum version was
                        enforced by default.

                 <b>TLS_VERIFY</b> <b>&lt;ON|OFF&gt;</b>
                        Specify whether to verify the server certificate for <b>https://</b> URLs.  If this  option  is
                        not   specified,   the  value  of  the  <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY</u>  variable  or  <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY</u>
                        environment variable will be used instead.  If neither is set, the default is <u>on</u>.

                        Changed in version 3.31: The default is on.  Previously, the default was off.  Users may
                        set the <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY</u> environment variable to <b>0</b> to restore the old default.

                        Added in version 3.18: Added support to <b>file(UPLOAD)</b>.

                 <b>TLS_CAINFO</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
                        Specify a custom Certificate Authority file for <b>https://</b> URLs.  If this  option  is  not
                        specified, the value of the <u>CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO</u> variable will be used instead.

                        Added in version 3.18: Added support to <b>file(UPLOAD)</b>.

              For <b>https://</b> URLs CMake must be built with SSL/TLS support.

              Additional options to <b>DOWNLOAD</b> are:

                 <b>EXPECTED_HASH</b> <b>&lt;algorithm&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b>
                        Verify that the downloaded content hash matches the expected value, where <b>&lt;algorithm&gt;</b> is
                        one  of  the algorithms supported by <u>&lt;HASH&gt;</u>.  If the file already exists and matches the
                        hash, the download is skipped.  If the file already exists and does not match the  hash,
                        the  file  is  downloaded again. If after download the file does not match the hash, the
                        operation fails with an error. It is an error to specify this option if <b>DOWNLOAD</b> is  not
                        given a <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>.

                 <b>EXPECTED_MD5</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
                        Historical  short-hand  for <b>EXPECTED_HASH</b> <b>MD5=&lt;value&gt;</b>. It is an error to specify this if
                        <b>DOWNLOAD</b> is not given a <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>.

                 <b>RANGE_START</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
                        Added in version 3.24.

                        Offset of the start of the range in file in bytes. Could be omitted to  download  up  to
                        the specified <b>RANGE_END</b>.

                 <b>RANGE_END</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
                        Added in version 3.24.

                        Offset of the end of the range in file in bytes. Could be omitted to download everything
                        from the specified <b>RANGE_START</b> to the end of file.

   <b>Locking</b>
       <b>file(LOCK</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> <b>[DIRECTORY]</b> <b>[RELEASE]</b> <b>[GUARD</b> <b>&lt;FUNCTION|FILE|PROCESS&gt;]</b> <b>[RESULT_VARIABLE</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;]</b>
       <b>[TIMEOUT</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;])</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              Lock  a  file  specified  by  <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>  if  no  <b>DIRECTORY</b>  option present and file <b>&lt;path&gt;/cmake.lock</b>
              otherwise.  The file will be locked for the scope defined by the <b>GUARD</b> option  (default  value  is
              <b>PROCESS</b>).  The <b>RELEASE</b> option can be used to unlock the file explicitly.  If the <b>TIMEOUT</b> option is
              not  specified, CMake will wait until the lock succeeds or until a fatal error occurs.  If <b>TIMEOUT</b>
              is set to <b>0</b>, locking will be tried once and the result will be reported immediately.   If  <b>TIMEOUT</b>
              is not <b>0</b>, CMake will try to lock the file for the period specified by the <b>TIMEOUT</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b> value.
              Any  errors  will  be  interpreted as fatal if there is no <b>RESULT_VARIABLE</b> option.  Otherwise, the
              result will be stored in <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> and will be <b>0</b> on success or an error message on failure.

              Note that lock is advisory; there is no guarantee that other processes  will  respect  this  lock,
              i.e. lock synchronize two or more CMake instances sharing some modifiable resources. Similar logic
              applies  to  the  <b>DIRECTORY</b> option; locking a parent directory doesn't prevent other <b>LOCK</b> commands
              from locking any child directory or file.

              Trying to lock the same file twice is not allowed.  Any  intermediate  directories  and  the  file
              itself  will  be  created  if  they  not  exist.  The <b>GUARD</b> and <b>TIMEOUT</b> options are ignored on the

              Added in version 3.18.

              Creates the specified <b>&lt;archive&gt;</b> file with the files and directories listed in <b>&lt;paths&gt;</b>.  Note  that
              <b>&lt;paths&gt;</b> must list actual files or directories; wildcards are not supported.

              The options are:

              <b>FORMAT</b> <b>&lt;format&gt;</b>
                     Specify the archive format.  Supported values for <b>&lt;format&gt;</b> are <b>7zip</b>, <b>gnutar</b>, <b>pax</b>, <b>paxr</b>, <b>raw</b>
                     and <b>zip</b>.  If <b>FORMAT</b> is not given, the default format is <b>paxr</b>.

              <b>COMPRESSION</b> <b>&lt;compression&gt;</b>
                     Some  archive  formats  allow  the  type  of compression to be specified.  The <b>7zip</b> and <b>zip</b>
                     archive formats already imply a specific type of compression.  The  other  formats  use  no
                     compression  by  default,  but can be directed to do so with the <b>COMPRESSION</b> option.  Valid
                     values for <b>&lt;compression&gt;</b> are <b>None</b>, <b>BZip2</b>, <b>GZip</b>, <b>XZ</b>, and <b>Zstd</b>.

                     <b>NOTE:</b>
                        With <b>FORMAT</b> set to <b>raw</b>, only one file will  be  compressed  with  the  compression  type
                        specified by <b>COMPRESSION</b>.

              <b>COMPRESSION_LEVEL</b> <b>&lt;compression-level&gt;</b>
                     Added in version 3.19.

                     The   compression   level   can  be  specified  with  the  <b>COMPRESSION_LEVEL</b>  option.   The
                     <b>&lt;compression-level&gt;</b> should be between 0-9, with  the  default  being  0.   The  <b>COMPRESSION</b>
                     option must be present when <b>COMPRESSION_LEVEL</b> is given.

                     Added  in  version  3.26:  The <b>&lt;compression-level&gt;</b> of the <b>Zstd</b> algorithm can be set between
                     0-19.

              <b>MTIME</b> <b>&lt;mtime&gt;</b>
                     Specify the modification time recorded in tarball entries.

              <b>WORKING_DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                     Added in version 3.31.

                     Specify the directory in which the archive creation operation will be executed.   Paths  in
                     the  <b>&lt;paths&gt;</b>  argument  can be relative to this directory.  If this option is not provided,
                     the current working directory will be used by default.

              Added in version 3.18.

              Extracts or lists the content of the specified <b>&lt;archive&gt;</b>.

              The options are:

              <b>DESTINATION</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                     Specify the directory under which the content of the archive will  be  extracted.   If  the
                     directory  does  not  exist,  it will be created.  If <b>DESTINATION</b> is not given, the current
                     binary directory will be used.

              <b>PATTERNS</b> <b>&lt;pattern&gt;...</b>
                     Extract/list only files and directories that match one of the  given  patterns.   Wildcards
                     are  supported.   If the <b>PATTERNS</b> option is not given, the entire archive will be listed or
                     extracted.

              <b>LIST_ONLY</b>
                     List the files in the archive rather than extract them.

              <b>TOUCH</b>  Added in version 3.24.

                     Give extracted files a current local timestamp instead of extracting file  timestamps  from
                     the archive.

              <b>VERBOSE</b>
                     Enable verbose output from the extraction operation.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 The  working  directory for this subcommand is the <b>DESTINATION</b> directory (provided or computed)
                 except when <b>LIST_ONLY</b> is specified. Therefore, outside of  script  mode,  it  may  be  best  to
                 provide  absolute paths to <b>INPUT</b> archives as they are unlikely to be extracted where a relative
                 path works.

                   [POST_EXCLUDE_FILES &lt;files&gt;...]
                   )

              Please note that this sub-command is not intended to be used in project mode.  It is intended  for
              use at install time, either from code generated by the <u>install(RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET)</u> command, or
              from code provided by the project via <u>install(CODE)</u> or <u>install(SCRIPT)</u>.  For example:

                 install(CODE [[
                   file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES
                     # ...
                     )
                   ]])

              The arguments are as follows:

                 <b>RESOLVED_DEPENDENCIES_VAR</b> <b>&lt;deps_var&gt;</b>
                        Name of the variable in which to store the list of resolved dependencies.

                 <b>UNRESOLVED_DEPENDENCIES_VAR</b> <b>&lt;unresolved_deps_var&gt;</b>
                        Name  of  the  variable  in  which to store the list of unresolved dependencies. If this
                        variable is not specified, and there  are  any  unresolved  dependencies,  an  error  is
                        issued.

                 <b>CONFLICTING_DEPENDENCIES_PREFIX</b> <b>&lt;conflicting_deps_prefix&gt;</b>
                        Variable  prefix in which to store conflicting dependency information.  Dependencies are
                        conflicting if two files with the same name are found in two different directories.  The
                        list  of  filenames that conflict are stored in <b>&lt;conflicting_deps_prefix&gt;_FILENAMES</b>. For
                        each filename, the list of paths that  were  found  for  that  filename  are  stored  in
                        <b>&lt;conflicting_deps_prefix&gt;_&lt;filename&gt;</b>.

                 <b>EXECUTABLES</b> <b>&lt;executable_files&gt;...</b>
                        List  of  executable  files  to  read  for  dependencies. These are executables that are
                        typically created with <u>add_executable()</u>, but they do not have to be created by CMake. On
                        Apple platforms, the paths to these files determine the value of  <b>@executable_path</b>  when
                        recursively  resolving the libraries. Specifying any kind of library (<b>STATIC</b>, <b>MODULE</b>, or
                        <b>SHARED</b>) here will result in undefined behavior.

                 <b>LIBRARIES</b> <b>&lt;library_files&gt;...</b>
                        List of library files to read for dependencies. These are libraries that  are  typically
                        created  with  <u>add_library(SHARED)</u>,  but  they  do  not  have  to  be  created by CMake.
                        Specifying <b>STATIC</b> libraries, <b>MODULE</b>  libraries,  or  executables  here  will  result  in
                        undefined behavior.

                 <b>MODULES</b> <b>&lt;module_files&gt;...</b>
                        List  of  loadable  module  files  to  read for dependencies. These are modules that are
                        typically created with <u>add_library(MODULE)</u>, but they do not have to be created by CMake.
                        They are typically used by calling <b>dlopen()</b> at runtime rather than linked at  link  time
                        with  <b>ld</b>  <b>-l</b>.   Specifying  <b>STATIC</b> libraries, <b>SHARED</b> libraries, or executables here will
                        result in undefined behavior.

                 <b>DIRECTORIES</b> <b>&lt;directories&gt;...</b>
                        List of additional directories to search for dependencies.  On  Linux  platforms,  these
                        directories are searched if the dependency is not found in any of the other usual paths.
                        If  it is found in such a directory, a warning is issued, because it means that the file
                        is incomplete (it does not list all of the directories that contain  its  dependencies).
                        On  Windows  platforms, these directories are searched if the dependency is not found in
                        any of the other search paths, but no warning is issued, because searching  other  paths
                        is a normal part of Windows dependency resolution. On Apple platforms, this argument has
                        no effect.

                 <b>BUNDLE_EXECUTABLE</b> <b>&lt;bundle_executable_file&gt;</b>
                        Executable  to  treat  as  the  "bundle  executable" when resolving libraries.  On Apple
                        platforms, this argument determines  the  value  of  <b>@executable_path</b>  when  recursively
                        resolving  libraries  for  <b>LIBRARIES</b>  and <b>MODULES</b> files. It has no effect on <b>EXECUTABLES</b>
                        files. On other platforms, it has no effect. This is typically (but not always)  one  of
                        the  executables  in  the <b>EXECUTABLES</b> argument which designates the "main" executable of
                        the package.

              The following arguments specify filters for including or excluding libraries to be  resolved.  See
              below for a full description of how they work.

                 <b>PRE_INCLUDE_REGEXES</b> <b>&lt;regexes&gt;...</b>
                        List  of  pre-include  regexes  through  which  to  filter the names of not-yet-resolved
                        dependencies.

                 <b>PRE_EXCLUDE_REGEXES</b> <b>&lt;regexes&gt;...</b>
                        List of pre-exclude regexes through  which  to  filter  the  names  of  not-yet-resolved
                        dependencies.

                 <b>POST_INCLUDE_REGEXES</b> <b>&lt;regexes&gt;...</b>
                        List of post-include regexes through which to filter the names of resolved dependencies.

                 <b>POST_EXCLUDE_REGEXES</b> <b>&lt;regexes&gt;...</b>
                        List of post-exclude regexes through which to filter the names of resolved dependencies.

                 <b>POST_INCLUDE_FILES</b> <b>&lt;files&gt;...</b>
                        Added in version 3.21.

                        List   of  post-include  filenames  through  which  to  filter  the  names  of  resolved
                        dependencies. Symlinks are resolved when attempting to match these filenames.

                 <b>POST_EXCLUDE_FILES</b> <b>&lt;files&gt;...</b>
                        Added in version 3.21.

                        List  of  post-exclude  filenames  through  which  to  filter  the  names  of   resolved
                        dependencies. Symlinks are resolved when attempting to match these filenames.

              These  arguments can be used to exclude unwanted system libraries when resolving the dependencies,
              or to include libraries from a specific directory. The filtering works as follows:

              1. If the not-yet-resolved dependency matches any of the <b>PRE_INCLUDE_REGEXES</b>, steps 2  and  3  are
                 skipped, and the dependency resolution proceeds to step 4.

              2. If   the  not-yet-resolved  dependency  matches  any  of  the  <b>PRE_EXCLUDE_REGEXES</b>,  dependency
                 resolution stops for that dependency.

              3. Otherwise, dependency resolution proceeds.

              4. <b>file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)</b> searches for the dependency according to the  linking  rules  of
                 the platform (see below).

              5. If  the  dependency  is  found,  and  its  full path matches one of the <b>POST_INCLUDE_REGEXES</b> or
                 <b>POST_INCLUDE_FILES</b>,  the   full   path   is   added   to   the   resolved   dependencies,   and
                 <b>file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)</b> recursively resolves that library's own dependencies. Otherwise,
                 resolution proceeds to step 6.

              6. If  the  dependency  is  found,  but  its  full path matches one of the <b>POST_EXCLUDE_REGEXES</b> or
                 <b>POST_EXCLUDE_FILES</b>, it is not added to the resolved  dependencies,  and  dependency  resolution
                 stops for that dependency.

              7. If  the  dependency  is  found,  and  its full path does not match either <b>POST_INCLUDE_REGEXES</b>,
                 <b>POST_INCLUDE_FILES</b>, <b>POST_EXCLUDE_REGEXES</b>, or <b>POST_EXCLUDE_FILES</b>, the full path is added to  the
                 resolved  dependencies, and <b>file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)</b>  recursively resolves that library's
                 own dependencies.

              Different platforms have different rules for how dependencies are resolved.  These  specifics  are
              described here.

              On Linux platforms, library resolution works as follows:

              1. If  the  depending file does not have any <b>RUNPATH</b> entries, and the library exists in one of the
                 depending file's <b>RPATH</b> entries, or its parents', in that order, the dependency is  resolved  to
                 that file.

              2. Otherwise,  if  the  depending  file  has any <b>RUNPATH</b> entries, and the library exists in one of
                 those entries, the dependency is resolved to that file.

              3. Otherwise, if the library exists in one of the directories listed by <b>ldconfig</b>,  the  dependency
                 is resolved to that file.

              4. Otherwise,  if the library exists in one of the <b>DIRECTORIES</b> entries, the dependency is resolved
                 to that file. In this case, a warning  is  issued,  because  finding  a  file  in  one  of  the
                 <b>DIRECTORIES</b> means that the depending file is not complete (it does not list all the directories
                 from which it pulls dependencies).

              5. Otherwise, the dependency is unresolved.

              Changed  in  version  3.31:  Resolution  of each encountered library file name occurs at most once
              while processing a given root ELF file (executable or shared object).  If a library file  name  is
              encountered  again in the dependency tree, the original resolution is assumed.  This behavior more
              closely matches the dynamic loader's behavior on Linux.

              On Windows platforms, library resolution works as follows:

              1. DLL dependency names are converted to lowercase for matching filters.  Windows  DLL  names  are
                 case-insensitive,  and some linkers mangle the case of the DLL dependency names.  However, this
                 makes it more difficult for <b>PRE_INCLUDE_REGEXES</b>, <b>PRE_EXCLUDE_REGEXES</b>, <b>POST_INCLUDE_REGEXES</b>, and
                 <b>POST_EXCLUDE_REGEXES</b> to properly filter DLL names - every regex would have to  check  for  both
                 uppercase and lowercase letters.  For example:

                    file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES
                      # ...
                      PRE_INCLUDE_REGEXES "^[Mm][Yy][Ll][Ii][Bb][Rr][Aa][Rr][Yy]\\.[Dd][Ll][Ll]$"
                      )

                 Converting  the  DLL  name  to lowercase allows the regexes to only match lowercase names, thus
                 simplifying the regex. For example:

                    file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES
                      # ...
                      PRE_INCLUDE_REGEXES "^mylibrary\\.dll$"
                      )

                 This regex will match <b>mylibrary.dll</b> regardless of how it is cased, either on  disk  or  in  the
                 depending file. (For example, it will match <b>mylibrary.dll</b>, <b>MyLibrary.dll</b>, and <b>MYLIBRARY.DLL</b>.)

                 Changed  in  version  3.27:  The  conversion  to lowercase only applies while matching filters.
                 Results reported after filtering case-preserve each DLL  name  as  it  is  found  on  disk,  if
                 resolved, and otherwise as it is referenced by the dependent binary.

                 Prior to CMake 3.27, the results were reported with lowercase DLL file names, but the directory
                 portion retained its casing.

              2. (<b>Not</b>  <b>yet</b>  <b>implemented</b>)  If  the  depending  file is a Windows Store app, and the dependency is
                 listed as a dependency in the application's package manifest, the  dependency  is  resolved  to
                 that file.

              3. Otherwise, if the library exists in the same directory as the depending file, the dependency is
                 resolved to that file.

              4. Otherwise,  if  the  library  exists in either the operating system's <b>system32</b> directory or the
                 <b>Windows</b> directory, in that order, the dependency is resolved to that file.

              5. Otherwise, if the library exists in one of the directories specified  by  <b>DIRECTORIES</b>,  in  the
                 order  they are listed, the dependency is resolved to that file. In this case, a warning is not
                 issued, because searching other directories is a normal part of Windows library resolution.

              6. Otherwise, the dependency is unresolved.

              On Apple platforms, library resolution works as follows:

              1. If the dependency starts with <b>@executable_path/</b>, and an <b>EXECUTABLES</b> argument is in the  process
                 of  being resolved, and replacing <b>@executable_path/</b> with the directory of the executable yields
                 an existing file, the dependency is resolved to that file.

              2. Otherwise, if the dependency starts with <b>@executable_path/</b>, and there  is  a  <b>BUNDLE_EXECUTABLE</b>
                 argument, and replacing <b>@executable_path/</b> with the directory of the bundle executable yields an
                 existing file, the dependency is resolved to that file.

              3. Otherwise,  if  the  dependency starts with <b>@loader_path/</b>, and replacing <b>@loader_path/</b> with the
                 directory of the depending file yields an existing file, the dependency  is  resolved  to  that
                 file.

              4. Otherwise,  if  the dependency starts with <b>@rpath/</b>, and replacing <b>@rpath/</b> with one of the <b>RPATH</b>
                 entries of the depending file yields an existing file, the dependency is resolved to that file.
                 Note that <b>RPATH</b> entries that start with <b>@executable_path/</b>  or  <b>@loader_path/</b>  also  have  these
                 items replaced with the appropriate path.

              5. Otherwise,  if  the  dependency  is an absolute file that exists, the dependency is resolved to
                 that file.

              6. Otherwise, the dependency is unresolved.

              This function accepts  several  variables  that  determine  which  tool  is  used  for  dependency
              resolution:

              <b>CMAKE_GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES_PLATFORM</b>
                     Determines which operating system and executable format the files are built for. This could
                     be one of several values:

                     • <b>linux+elf</b>

                     • <b>windows+pe</b>

                     • <b>macos+macho</b>

                     If this variable is not specified, it is determined automatically by system introspection.

              <b>CMAKE_GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES_TOOL</b>
                     Determines  the  tool  to use for dependency resolution. It could be one of several values,
                     depending on the value of <u>CMAKE_GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES_PLATFORM</u>:
                         ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┐

                     If this variable is not specified, it is determined automatically by system introspection.

              <b>CMAKE_GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES_COMMAND</b>
                     Determines the path to the tool to use for dependency resolution. This is the  actual  path
                     to <b>objdump</b>, <b>dumpbin</b>, or <b>otool</b>.

                     If  this  variable is not specified, it is determined by the value of <b>CMAKE_OBJDUMP</b> if set,
                     else by system introspection.

                     Added in version 3.18: Use <b>CMAKE_OBJDUMP</b> if set.

   <b>find_file</b>
       A short-hand signature is:

          find_file (&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])

       The general signature is:

                   )

       This command is used to find a full path to named file.  A cache entry, or a normal variable if  <b>NO_CACHE</b>
       is  specified, named by <b>&lt;VAR&gt;</b> is created to store the result of this command.  If the full path to a file
       is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable  is
       cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be <b>&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND</b>.

       Options include:

       <b>NAMES</b>  Specify one or more possible names for the full path to a file.

              When  using  this  to specify names with and without a version suffix, we recommend specifying the
              unversioned name first so that locally-built packages  can  be  found  before  those  provided  by
              distributions.

       <b>HINTS,</b> <b>PATHS</b>
              Specify  directories to search in addition to the default locations.  The <b>ENV</b> <b>var</b> sub-option reads
              paths from a system environment variable.

              Changed in version 3.24: On <b>Windows</b> platform, it is possible to include registry queries  as  part
              of  the  directories,  using a <u>dedicated</u> <u>syntax</u>.  Such specifications will be ignored on all other
              platforms.

       <b>REGISTRY_VIEW</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Specify which registry views must be queried. This option is only meaningful on <b>Windows</b>  platforms
              and  will  be  ignored on other ones. When not specified, the <b>TARGET</b> view is used when the <u>CMP0134</u>
              policy is <b>NEW</b>. Refer to <u>CMP0134</u> for the default view when the policy is <b>OLD</b>.

              <b>64</b>     Query  the  64-bit  registry.  On  32-bit   Windows,   it   always   returns   the   string
                     <b>/REGISTRY-NOTFOUND</b>.

              <b>32</b>     Query the 32-bit registry.

              <b>64_32</b>  Query both views (<b>64</b> and <b>32</b>) and generate a path for each.

              <b>32_64</b>  Query both views (<b>32</b> and <b>64</b>) and generate a path for each.

              <b>HOST</b>   Query  the  registry  matching the architecture of the host: <b>64</b> on 64-bit Windows and <b>32</b> on
                     32-bit Windows.

              <b>TARGET</b> Query the registry matching the architecture specified by the <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u> variable.
                     If not defined, fall back to <b>HOST</b> view.

              <b>BOTH</b>   Query both  views  (<b>32</b>  and  <b>64</b>).  The  order  depends  on  the  following  rules:  If  the
                     <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u> variable is defined, use the following view depending on the content of
                     this variable:

                     • <b>8</b>: <b>64_32</b>

                     • <b>4</b>: <b>32_64</b>

                     If the <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u> variable is not defined, rely on the architecture of the host:

                     • 64-bit: <b>64_32</b>

                     • 32-bit: <b>32</b>

       <b>PATH_SUFFIXES</b>
              Specify additional subdirectories to check below each directory location otherwise considered.

       <b>VALIDATOR</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              Specify  a  <u>function()</u>  to  be called for each candidate item found (a <u>macro()</u> cannot be provided,
              that will result in an error).  Two arguments will be passed to the validator function:  the  name
              of  a result variable, and the absolute path to the candidate item.  The item will be accepted and
              the search will end unless the function sets the value in the result  variable  to  false  in  the
              calling scope.  The result variable will hold a true value when the validator function is entered.

                 function(my_check validator_result_var item)
                   if(NOT item MATCHES ...)
                     set(${validator_result_var} FALSE PARENT_SCOPE)
                   endif()
                 endfunction()

                 find_file (result NAMES ... VALIDATOR my_check)

              Note  that  if  a  cached result is used, the search is skipped and any <b>VALIDATOR</b> is ignored.  The
              cached result is not required to pass the validation function.

       <b>DOC</b>    Specify the documentation string for the <b>&lt;VAR&gt;</b> cache entry.

       <b>NO_CACHE</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              The result of the search will be stored in a normal variable rather than a cache entry.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If the variable is already set before the call (as a normal or cache variable) then the  search
                 will not occur.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 This  option  should  be used with caution because it can greatly increase the cost of repeated
                 configure steps.

       <b>REQUIRED</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              Stop processing with an error message if nothing is found, otherwise the search will be  attempted
              again the next time find_file is invoked with the same variable.

       If <b>NO_DEFAULT_PATH</b> is specified, then no additional paths are added to the search.  If <b>NO_DEFAULT_PATH</b> is
       not specified, the search process is as follows:

       1. If   called   from   within   a   find   module   or   any   other   script   loaded   by  a  call  to
          <u>find_package(&lt;PackageName&gt;)</u>, search prefixes unique to the current package being  found.   See  policy
          <u>CMP0074</u>.

          Added in version 3.12.

          Specifically, search paths specified by the following variables, in order:

          a. <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> CMake variable, where <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> is the case-preserved package name.

          b. <u>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;_ROOT</u> CMake variable, where <b>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;</b> is the upper-cased package name.  See policy
             <u>CMP0144</u>.

             Added in version 3.27.

          c. <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> environment variable, where <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> is the case-preserved package name.

          d. <u>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;_ROOT</u>  environment variable, where <b>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;</b> is the upper-cased package name.  See
             policy <u>CMP0144</u>.

             Added in version 3.27.

          The package root variables are maintained as a stack, so if called from nested find modules or  config
          packages, root paths from the parent's find module or config package will be searched after paths from
          the  current  module  or  package.   In  other words, the search order would be <b>&lt;CurrentPackage&gt;_ROOT</b>,
          <b>ENV{&lt;CurrentPackage&gt;_ROOT}</b>, <b>&lt;ParentPackage&gt;_ROOT</b>, <b>ENV{&lt;ParentPackage&gt;_ROOT}</b>, etc.  This can be skipped
          if <b>NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH</b> is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt;</b> if <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u> is set, and <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include</b> for each <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>
            in the <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> CMake variable and the <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> environment variable  if  called
            from within a find module loaded by <u>find_package(&lt;PackageName&gt;)</u>

       2. Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache  variables.   These are intended to be used on the
          command line with a <b>-DVAR=value</b>.  The values are interpreted as <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>lists</u>.   This  can
          be skipped if <b>NO_CMAKE_PATH</b> is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt;</b> if <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u> is set, and <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include</b> for each <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>
            in <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</u>

       3. Search  paths  specified in cmake-specific environment variables.  These are intended to be set in the
          user's shell configuration, and therefore use the host's native path separator (<b>;</b> on Windows and <b>:</b>  on
          UNIX).    This   can   be   skipped   if   <b>NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</b>  is  passed  or  by  setting  the
          <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt;</b> if <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u> is set, and <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include</b> for each <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>
            in <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</u>

       4. Search the  paths  specified  by  the  <b>HINTS</b>  option.   These  should  be  paths  computed  by  system
          introspection,  such  as  a  hint  provided by the location of another item already found.  Hard-coded
          guesses should be specified with the <b>PATHS</b> option.

       5. Search the standard system environment variables.  This can be skipped  if  <b>NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</b>
          is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • The directories in <b>INCLUDE</b> and <b>PATH</b>.

          On  Windows  hosts,  CMake  3.3  through  3.27  searched  additional paths: <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt;</b> if
          <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u> is  set,  and  <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include</b>  for  each  <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin</b>  in  <b>PATH</b>,  and
          <b>&lt;entry&gt;/include</b> for other entries in <b>PATH</b>.  This behavior was removed by CMake 3.28.

       6. Search  cmake  variables  defined  in  the  Platform  files  for the current system.  The searching of
          <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b> and <b>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</b> can be skipped if <b>NO_CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b> is  passed  or
          by  setting  the  <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>  to  <b>FALSE</b>.  All  these  locations  can  be skipped if
          <b>NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH</b> is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt;</b> if <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u> is set, and <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include</b> for each <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>
            in <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</u>

          The platform paths that these  variables  contain  are  locations  that  typically  include  installed
          software. An example being <b><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></b> for UNIX based platforms.

       7. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in the short-hand version of the command.  These are
          typically hard-coded guesses.

       The        <u>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH</u>,        <u>CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</u>,        <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH</u>        and
       <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</u> variables can also cause some of the above locations to be ignored.

       Added in version 3.16: Added <b>CMAKE_FIND_USE_&lt;CATEGORY&gt;_PATH</b> variables to globally disable various  search
       locations.

       On  macOS  the  <u>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</u> and <u>CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE</u> variables determine the order of preference
       between Apple-style and unix-style package components.

       The CMake variable <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> specifies one or more directories to be prepended  to  all  other
       search  directories.   This  effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.  Paths which
       are descendants of the <u>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</u> are excluded from this re-rooting, because that  variable  is
       always a path on the host system.  By default the <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> is empty.

       The <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> variable can also be used to specify exactly one directory to use as a prefix.  Setting
       <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> also has other effects.  See the documentation for that variable for more.

       These  variables  are especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of the target
       environment  and  CMake  will  search  there  too.   By  default  at  first  the  directories  listed  in
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u>  are searched, then the <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> directory is searched, and then the non-rooted
       directories   will   be   searched.    The   default   behavior    can    be    adjusted    by    setting
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE</u>.   This  behavior  can be manually overridden on a per-call basis using
       options:

       <b>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH</b>
              Search in the order described above.

       <b>NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</b>
              Do not use the <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> variable.

       <b>ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</b>
              Search only the re-rooted directories and directories below <u>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</u>.

       The default search order is designed  to  be  most-specific  to  least-specific  for  common  use  cases.
       Projects may override the order by simply calling the command multiple times and using the <b>NO_*</b> options:

          find_file (&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
          find_file (&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)

       Once  one  of  the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and stored in the cache so that no call
       will search again.

   <b>find_library</b>
       A short-hand signature is:

          find_library (&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])

       The general signature is:

          find_library (
                    &lt;VAR&gt;
                    name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...] [NAMES_PER_DIR]
                    [HINTS [path | ENV var]... ]
                    [PATHS [path | ENV var]... ]
                    [REGISTRY_VIEW (64|32|64_32|32_64|HOST|TARGET|BOTH)]

                    [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
                    [NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
                    [NO_CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX]
                    [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                     ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                     NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                   )

       This command is used to find a library.  A cache entry, or a normal variable if  <b>NO_CACHE</b>  is  specified,
       named  by  <b>&lt;VAR&gt;</b>  is  created to store the result of this command.  If the library is found the result is
       stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is
       found, the result will be <b>&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND</b>.

       Options include:

       <b>NAMES</b>  Specify one or more possible names for the library.

              When using this to specify names with and without a version suffix, we  recommend  specifying  the
              unversioned  name  first  so  that  locally-built  packages  can be found before those provided by
              distributions.

       <b>HINTS,</b> <b>PATHS</b>
              Specify directories to search in addition to the default locations.  The <b>ENV</b> <b>var</b> sub-option  reads
              paths from a system environment variable.

              Changed  in  version 3.24: On <b>Windows</b> platform, it is possible to include registry queries as part
              of the directories, using a <u>dedicated</u> <u>syntax</u>.  Such specifications will be ignored  on  all  other
              platforms.

       <b>REGISTRY_VIEW</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Specify  which registry views must be queried. This option is only meaningful on <b>Windows</b> platforms
              and will be ignored on other ones. When not specified, the <b>TARGET</b> view is used  when  the  <u>CMP0134</u>
              policy is <b>NEW</b>. Refer to <u>CMP0134</u> for the default view when the policy is <b>OLD</b>.

              <b>64</b>     Query   the   64-bit   registry.   On   32-bit   Windows,  it  always  returns  the  string
                     <b>/REGISTRY-NOTFOUND</b>.

              <b>32</b>     Query the 32-bit registry.

              <b>64_32</b>  Query both views (<b>64</b> and <b>32</b>) and generate a path for each.

              <b>32_64</b>  Query both views (<b>32</b> and <b>64</b>) and generate a path for each.

              <b>HOST</b>   Query the registry matching the architecture of the host: <b>64</b> on 64-bit Windows  and  <b>32</b>  on
                     32-bit Windows.

              <b>TARGET</b> Query the registry matching the architecture specified by the <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u> variable.
                     If not defined, fall back to <b>HOST</b> view.

              <b>BOTH</b>   Query  both  views  (<b>32</b>  and  <b>64</b>).  The  order  depends  on  the  following  rules:  If the
                     <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u> variable is defined, use the following view depending on the content of
                     this variable:

                     • <b>8</b>: <b>64_32</b>

                     • <b>4</b>: <b>32_64</b>

                     If the <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u> variable is not defined, rely on the architecture of the host:

                     • 64-bit: <b>64_32</b>

                     • 32-bit: <b>32</b>

       <b>PATH_SUFFIXES</b>
              Specify additional subdirectories to check below each directory location otherwise considered.

       <b>VALIDATOR</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              Specify a <u>function()</u> to be called for each candidate item found (a  <u>macro()</u>  cannot  be  provided,
              that  will  result in an error).  Two arguments will be passed to the validator function: the name
              of a result variable, and the absolute path to the candidate item.  The item will be accepted  and
              the  search  will  end  unless  the function sets the value in the result variable to false in the
              calling scope.  The result variable will hold a true value when the validator function is entered.

                 function(my_check validator_result_var item)
                   if(NOT item MATCHES ...)
                     set(${validator_result_var} FALSE PARENT_SCOPE)
                   endif()
                 endfunction()

                 find_library (result NAMES ... VALIDATOR my_check)

              Note that if a cached result is used, the search is skipped and any  <b>VALIDATOR</b>  is  ignored.   The
              cached result is not required to pass the validation function.

       <b>DOC</b>    Specify the documentation string for the <b>&lt;VAR&gt;</b> cache entry.

       <b>NO_CACHE</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              The result of the search will be stored in a normal variable rather than a cache entry.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If  the variable is already set before the call (as a normal or cache variable) then the search
                 will not occur.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 This option should be used with caution because it can greatly increase the  cost  of  repeated
                 configure steps.

       <b>REQUIRED</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              Stop  processing with an error message if nothing is found, otherwise the search will be attempted
              again the next time find_library is invoked with the same variable.

       If <b>NO_DEFAULT_PATH</b> is specified, then no additional paths are added to the search.  If <b>NO_DEFAULT_PATH</b> is
       not specified, the search process is as follows:

       1. If  called  from  within   a   find   module   or   any   other   script   loaded   by   a   call   to
          <u>find_package(&lt;PackageName&gt;)</u>,  search  prefixes  unique to the current package being found.  See policy
          <u>CMP0074</u>.

          Added in version 3.12.

          Specifically, search paths specified by the following variables, in order:

          a. <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> CMake variable, where <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> is the case-preserved package name.

          b. <u>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;_ROOT</u> CMake variable, where <b>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;</b> is the upper-cased package name.  See policy
             <u>CMP0144</u>.

             Added in version 3.27.

          c. <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> environment variable, where <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> is the case-preserved package name.

          d. <u>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;_ROOT</u> environment variable, where <b>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;</b> is the upper-cased package name.   See
             policy <u>CMP0144</u>.

             Added in version 3.27.

          The  package root variables are maintained as a stack, so if called from nested find modules or config
          packages, root paths from the parent's find module or config package will be searched after paths from
          the current module or package.  In other words,  the  search  order  would  be  <b>&lt;CurrentPackage&gt;_ROOT</b>,
          <b>ENV{&lt;CurrentPackage&gt;_ROOT}</b>, <b>&lt;ParentPackage&gt;_ROOT</b>, <b>ENV{&lt;ParentPackage&gt;_ROOT}</b>, etc.  This can be skipped
          if <b>NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH</b> is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/lib/">/lib/</a>&lt;arch&gt;</b>  if <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u> is set, and <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></b> for each <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b> in the
            <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> CMake variable and the <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> environment  variable  if  called  from
            within a find module loaded by <u>find_package(&lt;PackageName&gt;)</u>

       2. Search  paths  specified  in  cmake-specific  cache  variables.   These are intended to be used on the
          command line with a <b>-DVAR=value</b>.  The values are interpreted as <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>lists</u>.   This  can
          be skipped if <b>NO_CMAKE_PATH</b> is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/lib/">/lib/</a>&lt;arch&gt;</b>  if  <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u>  is  set,  and <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></b> for each <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b> in
            <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</u>

       3. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.  These are intended to be set  in  the
          user's  shell configuration, and therefore use the host's native path separator (<b>;</b> on Windows and <b>:</b> on
          UNIX).   This  can  be  skipped  if  <b>NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</b>   is   passed   or   by   setting   the
          <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/lib/">/lib/</a>&lt;arch&gt;</b>  if  <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u>  is  set,  and <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></b> for each <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b> in
            <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</u>

       4. Search the  paths  specified  by  the  <b>HINTS</b>  option.   These  should  be  paths  computed  by  system
          introspection,  such  as  a  hint  provided by the location of another item already found.  Hard-coded
          guesses should be specified with the <b>PATHS</b> option.

       5. Search the standard system environment variables.  This can be skipped  if  <b>NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</b>
          is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • The directories in <b>LIB</b> and <b>PATH</b>.

          On   Windows  hosts,  CMake  3.3  through  3.27  searched  additional  paths:  <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/lib/">/lib/</a>&lt;arch&gt;</b>  if
          <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u> is set, and <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></b> for each <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin</b> in <b>PATH</b>, and  <b>&lt;entry&gt;<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></b>
          for other entries in <b>PATH</b>.  This behavior was removed by CMake 3.28.

       6. Search  cmake  variables  defined  in  the  Platform  files  for the current system.  The searching of
          <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b> and <b>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</b> can be skipped if <b>NO_CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b> is  passed  or
          by  setting  the  <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>  to  <b>FALSE</b>.  All  these  locations  can  be skipped if
          <b>NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH</b> is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/lib/">/lib/</a>&lt;arch&gt;</b> if <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u> is set, and  <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></b>  for  each  <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>  in
            <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</u>

          The  platform  paths  that  these  variables  contain  are  locations that typically include installed
          software. An example being <b><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></b> for UNIX based platforms.

       7. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in the short-hand version of the command.  These are
          typically hard-coded guesses.

       The        <u>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH</u>,        <u>CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</u>,        <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH</u>        and
       <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</u> variables can also cause some of the above locations to be ignored.

       Added  in version 3.16: Added <b>CMAKE_FIND_USE_&lt;CATEGORY&gt;_PATH</b> variables to globally disable various search
       locations.

       On macOS the <u>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</u> and <u>CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE</u> variables determine the  order  of  preference
       between Apple-style and unix-style package components.

       The  CMake  variable  <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other
       search directories.  This effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given  locations.   Paths  which
       are  descendants  of the <u>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</u> are excluded from this re-rooting, because that variable is
       always a path on the host system.  By default the <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> is empty.

       The <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> variable can also be used to specify exactly one directory to use as a prefix.  Setting
       <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> also has other effects.  See the documentation for that variable for more.

       These variables are especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of  the  target
       environment  and  CMake  will  search  there  too.   By  default  at  first  the  directories  listed  in
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> are searched, then the <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> directory is searched, and then the  non-rooted
       directories    will    be    searched.     The    default   behavior   can   be   adjusted   by   setting
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY</u>.  This behavior can be manually overridden on a  per-call  basis  using
       options:

       <b>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH</b>
              Search in the order described above.

       <b>NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</b>
              Do not use the <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> variable.

       <b>ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</b>
              Search only the re-rooted directories and directories below <u>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</u>.

       The  default  search  order  is  designed  to  be  most-specific  to least-specific for common use cases.
       Projects may override the order by simply calling the command multiple times and using the <b>NO_*</b> options:

          find_library (&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
          find_library (&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)

       Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and stored in the cache so  that  no  call
       will search again.

       When more than one value is given to the <b>NAMES</b> option this command by default will consider one name at a
       time  and  search  every  directory  for it.  The <b>NAMES_PER_DIR</b> option tells this command to consider one
       directory at a time and search for all names in it.

       Each library name given to the <b>NAMES</b> option  is  first  considered  as  a  library  file  name  and  then
       considered with platform-specific prefixes (e.g. <b>lib</b>) and suffixes (e.g. <b>.so</b>).  Therefore one may specify
       library  file  names such as <b>libfoo.a</b> directly.  This can be used to locate static libraries on UNIX-like
       systems.

       If the library found is a framework,  then  <b>&lt;VAR&gt;</b>  will  be  set  to  the  full  path  to  the  framework
       <b>&lt;fullPath&gt;/A.framework</b>.   When  a  full  path  to  a  framework  is  used  as a library, CMake will use a
       <b>-framework</b> <b>A</b>, and a <b>-F&lt;fullPath&gt;</b> to link the framework to the target.

       Added in version 3.28: The library found can now be a <b>.xcframework</b> folder.

       If the <u>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX</u> variable is set all search paths will be  tested  as  normal,
       with     the     suffix     appended,     and    with    all    matches    of    <b>lib/</b>    replaced    with
       <b>lib${CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX}/</b>.  This variable overrides  the  <u>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS</u>,
       <u>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS</u>, and <u>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS</u> global properties.

       If  the  <u>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS</u>  global  property is set all search paths will be tested as normal,
       with <b>32/</b> appended, and with all matches of <b>lib/</b> replaced with <b>lib32/</b>.  This property is automatically set
       for the platforms that are known to need it if at least one of the languages supported by  the  <u>project()</u>
       command is enabled.

       If  the  <u>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS</u>  global property is set all search paths will be tested as normal,
       with <b>x32/</b> appended, and with all matches of <b>lib/</b> replaced with <b>libx32/</b>.  This property  is  automatically
       set  for  the  platforms  that  are  known  to  need it if at least one of the languages supported by the
       <u>project()</u> command is enabled.

       If the <u>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS</u> global property is set all search paths will  be  tested  as  normal,
       with <b>64/</b> appended, and with all matches of <b>lib/</b> replaced with <b>lib64/</b>.  This property is automatically set
       for  the  platforms that are known to need it if at least one of the languages supported by the <u>project()</u>
       command is enabled.

   <b>find_package</b>
       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The <u>Using</u> <u>Dependencies</u> <u>Guide</u> provides a high-level introduction to this general topic. It  provides  a
          broader  overview  of  where  the  <b>find_package()</b>  command fits into the bigger picture, including its
          relationship to the <u>FetchContent</u> module.  The guide is recommended pre-reading before moving on to the
          details below.

       Find a package (usually provided by something external to the project),  and  load  its  package-specific
       details.  Calls to this command can also be intercepted by <u>dependency</u> <u>providers</u>.

   <b>Typical</b> <b>Usage</b>
       Most calls to <b>find_package()</b> typically have the following form:

          find_package(&lt;PackageName&gt; [&lt;version&gt;] [REQUIRED] [COMPONENTS &lt;components&gt;...])

       The <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> is the only mandatory argument.  The <b>&lt;version&gt;</b> is often omitted, and <b>REQUIRED</b> should be
       given  if  the  project  cannot  be  configured  successfully without the package.  Some more complicated
       packages support components which can be selected with the <b>COMPONENTS</b> keyword, but  most  packages  don't
       have that level of complexity.

       The  above is a reduced form of the <u>basic</u> <u>signature</u>.  Where possible, projects should find packages using
       this form.  This reduces complexity and maximizes the ways in which the package can be found or provided.

       Understanding the <u>basic</u> <u>signature</u>  should  be  enough  for  general  usage  of  <b>find_package()</b>.   Project
       maintainers  who intend to provide a config package should understand the bigger picture, as explained in
       <u>Full</u> <u>Signature</u> and all subsequent sections on this page.

   <b>Search</b> <b>Modes</b>
       The command has a few modes by which it searches for packages:

       <b>Module</b> <b>mode</b>
              In this mode, CMake searches for a file  called  <b>Find&lt;PackageName&gt;.cmake</b>,  looking  first  in  the
              locations  listed  in  the  <u>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</u>,  then  among the <u>Find</u> <u>Modules</u> provided by the CMake
              installation.  If the file is found, it is read and processed by CMake.   It  is  responsible  for
              finding  the  package, checking the version, and producing any needed messages.  Some Find modules
              provide limited or no support for versioning; check the Find module's documentation.

              The <b>Find&lt;PackageName&gt;.cmake</b> file is not typically provided by the package itself.  Rather,  it  is
              normally  provided  by  something  external  to  the  package, such as the operating system, CMake
              itself, or even the project from which the <b>find_package()</b> command was  called.   Being  externally
              provided, <u>Find</u> <u>Modules</u> tend to be heuristic in nature and are susceptible to becoming out-of-date.
              They typically search for certain libraries, files and other package artifacts.

              Module mode is only supported by the <u>basic</u> <u>command</u> <u>signature</u>.

       <b>Config</b> <b>mode</b>
              In   this   mode,   CMake  searches  for  a  file  called  <b>&lt;lowercasePackageName&gt;-config.cmake</b>  or
              <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;Config.cmake</b>.  It will also look for  <b>&lt;lowercasePackageName&gt;-config-version.cmake</b>  or
              <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;ConfigVersion.cmake</b>  if  version  details  were  specified  (see  <u>Config</u> <u>Mode</u> <u>Version</u>
              <u>Selection</u> for an explanation of how these separate version files are used).

              In config mode, the command can be given a list of names to search  for  as  package  names.   The
              locations  where  CMake searches for the config and version files is considerably more complicated
              than for Module mode (see <u>Config</u> <u>Mode</u> <u>Search</u> <u>Procedure</u>).

              The config and version files are typically installed as part of the package, so they  tend  to  be
              more  reliable  than Find modules.  They usually contain direct knowledge of the package contents,
              so no searching or heuristics are needed within the config or version files themselves.

              Config mode is supported by both the <u>basic</u> and <u>full</u> command signatures.

       <b>FetchContent</b> <b>redirection</b> <b>mode</b>
              Added in version 3.24: A call to <b>find_package()</b> can be redirected internally to a package provided
              by the <u>FetchContent</u> module.  To the caller, the behavior  will  appear  similar  to  Config  mode,
              except  that  the  search  logic  is  by-passed  and  the  component information is not used.  See
              <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u> and <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> for further details.

       When not redirected to a package provided by <u>FetchContent</u>, the command arguments determine whether Module
       or Config mode is used.  When the <u>basic</u> <u>signature</u> is used, the command searches in Module mode first.  If
       the  package  is  not  found,  the  search  falls  back  to  Config   mode.    A   user   may   set   the
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_PREFER_CONFIG</u>  variable  to  true  to  reverse the priority and direct CMake to search
       using Config mode first before falling back to Module mode.  The basic signature can also  be  forced  to
       use  only Module mode with a <b>MODULE</b> keyword.  If the <u>full</u> <u>signature</u> is used, the command only searches in
       Config mode.

   <b>Basic</b> <b>Signature</b>
          find_package(&lt;PackageName&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET] [MODULE]
                       [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
                       [OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS components...]
                       [REGISTRY_VIEW  (64|32|64_32|32_64|HOST|TARGET|BOTH)]
                       [GLOBAL]
                       [NO_POLICY_SCOPE]
                       [BYPASS_PROVIDER])

       The basic signature is supported by both Module and Config modes.  The <b>MODULE</b> keyword implies  that  only
       Module mode can be used to find the package, with no fallback to Config mode.

       Regardless  of  the mode used, a <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FOUND</b> variable will be set to indicate whether the package
       was found.  When the package is  found,  package-specific  information  may  be  provided  through  other
       variables and <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> documented by the package itself.  The <b>QUIET</b> option disables informational
       messages,  including  those  indicating  that  the  package  cannot  be found if it is not <b>REQUIRED</b>.  The
       <b>REQUIRED</b> option stops processing with an error message if the package cannot be found.

       A package-specific list of required components may be listed after the <b>COMPONENTS</b>  keyword.   If  any  of
       these components are not able to be satisfied, the package overall is considered to be not found.  If the
       <b>REQUIRED</b>  option  is also present, this is treated as a fatal error, otherwise execution still continues.
       As a form of shorthand, if the <b>REQUIRED</b> option is present, the <b>COMPONENTS</b> keyword can be omitted and  the
       required components can be listed directly after <b>REQUIRED</b>.

       Additional  optional  components  may be listed after <b>OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS</b>.  If these cannot be satisfied,
       the package overall can still be considered found, as long as all required components are satisfied.

       The set of available components and their meaning are defined by the target package.  Formally, it is  up
       to  the  target  package how to interpret the component information given to it, but it should follow the
       expectations stated above.  For calls where no components are specified,  there  is  no  single  expected
       behavior  and  target  packages  should  clearly  define  what occurs in such cases.  Common arrangements
       include assuming it should find all  components,  no  components  or  some  well-defined  subset  of  the
       available components.

       Added  in  version 3.24: The <b>REGISTRY_VIEW</b> keyword specifies which registry views should be queried. This
       keyword is only meaningful on <b>Windows</b> platforms and will be ignored on all others. Formally, it is up  to
       the target package how to interpret the registry view information given to it.

       Added  in version 3.24: Specifying the <b>GLOBAL</b> keyword will promote all imported targets to a global scope
       in  the  importing  project.  Alternatively,  this  functionality  can  be   enabled   by   setting   the
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_TARGETS_GLOBAL</u> variable.

       The  <b>[version]</b>  argument  requests a version with which the package found should be compatible. There are
       two possible forms in which it may be specified:

          • A single version with the format <b>major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]</b>, where each component  is  a  numeric
            value.

          • A  version range with the format <b>versionMin...[&lt;]versionMax</b> where <b>versionMin</b> and <b>versionMax</b> have the
            same format and constraints on components being integers as the single version.   By  default,  both
            end  points are included.  By specifying <b>&lt;</b>, the upper end point will be excluded. Version ranges are
            only supported with CMake 3.19 or later.

       The <b>EXACT</b> option requests that the version be matched exactly.  This  option  is  incompatible  with  the
       specification of a version range.

       If  no  <b>[version]</b>  and/or  component  list  is  given to a recursive invocation inside a find-module, the
       corresponding arguments are forwarded automatically from the outer call (including  the  <b>EXACT</b>  flag  for
       <b>[version]</b>).   Version  support  is currently provided only on a package-by-package basis (see the <u>Version</u>
       <u>Selection</u> section below).  When a version range is specified but the package is only designed to expect a
       single version, the package will ignore the upper end point of the range and only take the single version
       at the lower end of the range into account.

       See the <u>cmake_policy()</u> command documentation for discussion of the <b>NO_POLICY_SCOPE</b> option.

       Added in version 3.24: The <b>BYPASS_PROVIDER</b> keyword is only allowed when <b>find_package()</b> is being called by
       a <u>dependency</u> <u>provider</u>.  It can be used by providers to call the  built-in  <b>find_package()</b>  implementation
       directly  and prevent that call from being re-routed back to itself.  Future versions of CMake may detect
       attempts to use this keyword from places other than a dependency provider and halt with a fatal error.

       The <b>CONFIG</b> option, the synonymous <b>NO_MODULE</b> option, or the use of options  not  specified  in  the  <u>basic</u>
       <u>signature</u>  all  enforce  pure Config mode.  In pure Config mode, the command skips Module mode search and
       proceeds at once with Config mode search.

       Config mode search attempts to locate a configuration file provided by the package to be found.  A  cache
       entry  called  <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_DIR</b>  is  created to hold the directory containing the file.  By default, the
       command searches for a package with the name <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b>.  If the <b>NAMES</b>  option  is  given,  the  names
       following  it  are used instead of <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b>.  The names are also considered when determining whether
       to redirect the call to a package provided by <u>FetchContent</u>.

       The command searches for a file called <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;Config.cmake</b>  or  <b>&lt;lowercasePackageName&gt;-config.cmake</b>
       for  each  name specified.  A replacement set of possible configuration file names may be given using the
       <b>CONFIGS</b> option.  The <u>Config</u> <u>Mode</u> <u>Search</u> <u>Procedure</u> is specified below.  Once found, any <u>version</u> <u>constraint</u>
       is checked, and if satisfied, the configuration file is read and processed by CMake.  Since the  file  is
       provided  by  the  package  it  already  knows  the  location  of package contents.  The full path to the
       configuration file is stored in the cmake variable <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_CONFIG</b>.

       All configuration files which have been considered by CMake while  searching  for  the  package  with  an
       appropriate  version  are  stored  in  the  <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_CONSIDERED_CONFIGS</b> variable, and the associated
       versions in the <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_CONSIDERED_VERSIONS</b> variable.

       If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake will generate an  error  describing  the  problem
       unless  the  <b>QUIET</b>  argument is specified.  If <b>REQUIRED</b> is specified and the package is not found a fatal
       error is generated and the configure step stops executing.   If  <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_DIR</b>  has  been  set  to  a
       directory not containing a configuration file CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.

       Package  maintainers  providing CMake package configuration files are encouraged to name and install them
       such that the <u>Config</u> <u>Mode</u> <u>Search</u> <u>Procedure</u> outlined  below  will  find  them  without  requiring  use  of
       additional options.

   <b>Config</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>Search</b> <b>Procedure</b>
       <b>NOTE:</b>
          When  Config  mode  is  used, this search procedure is applied regardless of whether the <u>full</u> or <u>basic</u>
          signature was given.

       Added in version 3.24: All calls to <b>find_package()</b> (even in Module mode) first look for a config  package
       file  in  the  <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR</u>  directory.  The <u>FetchContent</u> module, or even the project
       itself, may write files to that location to redirect <b>find_package()</b> calls to content already provided  by
       the  project.   If  no  config package file is found in that location, the search proceeds with the logic
       described below.

       CMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes for the  package.   Under  each  prefix  several
       directories are searched for a configuration file.  The tables below show the directories searched.  Each
       entry is meant for installation trees following Windows (<b>W</b>), UNIX (<b>U</b>), or Apple (<b>A</b>) conventions:

            In all cases the <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> is treated as case-insensitive and corresponds to any of the names specified
            (<b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> or names given by <b>NAMES</b>).

            If at least one compiled language has been enabled, the architecture-specific  <b>lib/&lt;arch&gt;</b>  and  <b>lib*</b>
            directories may be searched based on the compiler's target architecture, in the following order:

       <b>lib/&lt;arch&gt;</b>
              Searched if the <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u> variable is set.

       <b>lib64</b>  Searched  on  64  bit  platforms  (<u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u>  is 8) and the <u>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS</u>
              property is set to <b>TRUE</b>.

       <b>lib32</b>  Searched on 32 bit platforms  (<u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u>  is  4)  and  the  <u>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS</u>
              property is set to <b>TRUE</b>.

       <b>libx32</b> Searched  on  platforms  using the x32 ABI if the <u>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS</u> property is set to
              <b>TRUE</b>.

       <b>lib</b>    Always searched.

       Changed in version 3.24: On <b>Windows</b> platform, it is possible to include registry queries as part  of  the
       directories  specified  through  <b>HINTS</b>  and <b>PATHS</b> keywords, using a <u>dedicated</u> <u>syntax</u>. Such specifications
       will be ignored on all other platforms.

       Added in version 3.24: <b>REGISTRY_VIEW</b> can be specified to manage <b>Windows</b>  registry  queries  specified  as
       part of <b>PATHS</b> and <b>HINTS</b>.

       Specify  which  registry  views  must be queried. This option is only meaningful on <b>Windows</b> platforms and
       will be ignored on other ones. When not specified, the <b>TARGET</b> view is used when  the  <u>CMP0134</u>  policy  is
       <b>NEW</b>. Refer to <u>CMP0134</u> for the default view when the policy is <b>OLD</b>.

       <b>64</b>     Query the 64-bit registry. On 32-bit Windows, it always returns the string <b>/REGISTRY-NOTFOUND</b>.

       <b>32</b>     Query the 32-bit registry.

       <b>64_32</b>  Query both views (<b>64</b> and <b>32</b>) and generate a path for each.

       <b>32_64</b>  Query both views (<b>32</b> and <b>64</b>) and generate a path for each.

       <b>HOST</b>   Query  the  registry  matching the architecture of the host: <b>64</b> on 64-bit Windows and <b>32</b> on 32-bit
              Windows.

       <b>TARGET</b> Query the registry matching the architecture specified by the <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u> variable. If not
              defined, fall back to <b>HOST</b> view.

       <b>BOTH</b>   Query both views (<b>32</b> and <b>64</b>). The order depends on the following rules: If the <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u>
              variable is defined, use the following view depending on the content of this variable:

              • <b>8</b>: <b>64_32</b>

              • <b>4</b>: <b>32_64</b>

              If the <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u> variable is not defined, rely on the architecture of the host:

              • 64-bit: <b>64_32</b>

              • 32-bit: <b>32</b>

       If <b>PATH_SUFFIXES</b> is specified, the suffixes are appended to each (<b>W</b>) or (<b>U</b>) directory entry one-by-one.

       This set of directories is intended to work in cooperation with projects that provide configuration files
       in their installation trees.  Directories above marked with (<b>W</b>) are intended for installations on Windows
       where the prefix may point at the top of an application's installation directory.  Those marked with  (<b>U</b>)
       are  intended  for installations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is shared by multiple packages.  This
       is merely a convention, so all (<b>W</b>) and (<b>U</b>) directories are still searched on all platforms.   Directories
       marked  with  (<b>A</b>)  are  intended  for  installations  on  Apple  platforms.  The <u>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</u> and
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE</u> variables determine the order of preference.

       The set of installation prefixes is  constructed  using  the  following  steps.   If  <b>NO_DEFAULT_PATH</b>  is
       specified all <b>NO_*</b> options are enabled.

       1. Search prefixes unique to the current <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> being found.  See policy <u>CMP0074</u>.

          Added in version 3.12.

          Specifically, search prefixes specified by the following variables, in order:

          a. <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> CMake variable, where <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> is the case-preserved package name.

          b. <u>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;_ROOT</u> CMake variable, where <b>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;</b> is the upper-cased package name.  See policy
             <u>CMP0144</u>.

             Added in version 3.27.

          c. <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> environment variable, where <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> is the case-preserved package name.

          d. <u>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;_ROOT</u>  environment variable, where <b>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;</b> is the upper-cased package name.  See
             policy <u>CMP0144</u>.

             Added in version 3.27.

          The package root variables are maintained as a stack so if called from  within  a  find  module,  root
          paths  from  the parent's find module will also be searched after paths for the current package.  This
          can be skipped if <b>NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH</b> is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH</u> to
          <b>FALSE</b>.

       2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.  These  are  intended  to  be  used  on  the
          command  line  with a <u>-DVAR=VALUE</u>.  The values are interpreted as <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>lists</u>.  This can
          be skipped if <b>NO_CMAKE_PATH</b> is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>:

          • <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</u>

       3. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.  These are intended to be set  in  the
          user's  shell configuration, and therefore use the host's native path separator (<b>;</b> on Windows and <b>:</b> on
          UNIX).   This  can  be  skipped  if  <b>NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</b>   is   passed   or   by   setting   the
          <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>:

          • <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_DIR</b>

          • <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</u>

       4. Search  paths  specified by the <b>HINTS</b> option.  These should be paths computed by system introspection,
          such as a hint provided by the location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses  should  be
          specified with the <b>PATHS</b> option.

       5. Search  the  standard system environment variables.  This can be skipped if <b>NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</b>
          is passed  or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>. Path entries  ending  in
          <b><a href="file:/bin">/bin</a></b> or <b><a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a></b> are automatically converted to their parent directories:

          • <b>PATH</b>

       6. Search   paths   stored   in   the   CMake   <u>User</u>   <u>Package</u>   <u>Registry</u>.    This   can  be  skipped  if
          <b>NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b> is passed or by  setting  the  variable  <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u>  to
          <b>FALSE</b> or the deprecated variable <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u> to <b>TRUE</b>.

          See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-packages.7.html">cmake-packages</a>(7)</u> manual for details on the user package registry.

       7. Search  cmake  variables  defined  in  the  Platform  files  for  the current system. The searching of
          <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> and <u>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</u> can be skipped if <b>NO_CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b> is  passed  or
          by  setting  the  <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>  to  <b>FALSE</b>.  All  these  locations  can  be skipped if
          <b>NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH</b> is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>:

          • <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH</u>

          The platform paths that these  variables  contain  are  locations  that  typically  include  installed
          software. An example being <b><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></b> for UNIX based platforms.

       8. Search   paths   stored   in   the   CMake   <u>System</u>   <u>Package</u>   <u>Registry</u>.   This  can  be  skipped  if
          <b>NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b> is passed or by  setting  the  <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u>
          variable to <b>FALSE</b> or the deprecated variable <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u> to <b>TRUE</b>.

          See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-packages.7.html">cmake-packages</a>(7)</u> manual for details on the system package registry.

       9. Search paths specified by the <b>PATHS</b> option.  These are typically hard-coded guesses.

       The        <u>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH</u>,        <u>CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</u>,        <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH</u>        and
       <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</u> variables can also cause some of the above locations to be ignored.

       Paths are searched in the order described above.  The first viable package configuration  file  found  is
       used, even if a newer version of the package resides later in the list of search paths.

       For  search  paths  which  contain  <b>&lt;name&gt;*</b>,  the  order  among  matching paths is unspecified unless the
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER</u>    variable    is    set.     This     variable,     along     with     the
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION</u>  variable,  determines  the  order  in which CMake considers paths that
       match a single search path containing <b>&lt;name&gt;*</b>.  For example, if the  file  system  contains  the  package
       configuration files

          &lt;prefix&gt;/example-1.2/example-config.cmake
          &lt;prefix&gt;/example-1.10/example-config.cmake
          &lt;prefix&gt;/share/example-2.0/example-config.cmake

       it  is  unspecified (when the aforementioned variables are unset) whether <b>find_package(example)</b> will find
       <b>example-1.2</b> or <b>example-1.10</b> (assuming that both are viable), but <b>find_package</b> will <u>not</u> find  <b>example-2.0</b>,
       because one of the other two will be found first.

       To  control  the  order  in  which  <b>find_package</b>  searches  directories that match a glob expression, use
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER</u> and <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION</u>.  For instance, to  cause  the  above
       example to select <b>example-1.10</b>, one can set

          SET(CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER NATURAL)
          SET(CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION DEC)

       before calling <b>find_package</b>.

       Added  in  version 3.16: Added the <b>CMAKE_FIND_USE_&lt;CATEGORY&gt;</b> variables to globally disable various search
       locations.

       The CMake variable <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> specifies one or more directories to be prepended  to  all  other
       search  directories.   This  effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.  Paths which
       are descendants of the <u>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</u> are excluded from this re-rooting, because that  variable  is
       always a path on the host system.  By default the <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> is empty.

       The <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> variable can also be used to specify exactly one directory to use as a prefix.  Setting
       <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> also has other effects.  See the documentation for that variable for more.

       These  variables  are especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of the target
       environment  and  CMake  will  search  there  too.   By  default  at  first  the  directories  listed  in
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u>  are searched, then the <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> directory is searched, and then the non-rooted
       directories   will   be   searched.    The   default   behavior    can    be    adjusted    by    setting
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE</u>.   This  behavior  can be manually overridden on a per-call basis using
       options:

       <b>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH</b>
              Search in the order described above.

       <b>NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</b>
              Do not use the <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> variable.

       <b>ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</b>
              Search only the re-rooted directories and directories below <u>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</u>.

       The default search order is designed  to  be  most-specific  to  least-specific  for  common  use  cases.
       Projects may override the order by simply calling the command multiple times and using the <b>NO_*</b> options:

          find_package (&lt;PackageName&gt; PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
          find_package (&lt;PackageName&gt;)

       Once  one  of  the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and stored in the cache so that no call
       will search again.

       By default the value stored in the result variable will be the path at which  the  file  is  found.   The
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_RESOLVE_SYMLINKS</u>  variable  may be set to <b>TRUE</b> before calling <b>find_package</b> in order to
       resolve symbolic links and store the real path to the file.

       Every non-REQUIRED <b>find_package</b> call can be disabled or made REQUIRED:

       • Setting the <u>CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt;</u> variable to <b>TRUE</b> disables the package.  This  also
         disables redirection to a package provided by <u>FetchContent</u>.

       • Setting the <u>CMAKE_REQUIRE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt;</u> variable to <b>TRUE</b> makes the package REQUIRED.

       Setting both variables to <b>TRUE</b> simultaneously is an error.

   <b>Config</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>Version</b> <b>Selection</b>
       <b>NOTE:</b>
          When  Config mode is used, this version selection process is applied regardless of whether the <u>full</u> or
          <u>basic</u> signature was given.

       When the <b>[version]</b> argument is given, Config mode will only find a version of  the  package  that  claims
       compatibility with the requested version (see <u>format</u> <u>specification</u>). If the <b>EXACT</b> option is given, only a
       version  of  the  package  claiming an exact match of the requested version may be found.  CMake does not
       establish any convention for the meaning of version numbers.  Package  version  numbers  are  checked  by
       "version"  files  provided  by  the  packages  themselves  or  by  <u>FetchContent</u>.  For a candidate package
       configuration file <b>&lt;config-file&gt;.cmake</b> the corresponding version file is located next  to  it  and  named
       either  <b>&lt;config-file&gt;-version.cmake</b>  or <b>&lt;config-file&gt;Version.cmake</b>.  If no such version file is available
       then the configuration file is assumed to not be compatible with any requested version.  A basic  version
       file  containing generic version matching code can be created using the <u>CMakePackageConfigHelpers</u> module.
       When a version file is found it is loaded to check the requested version number.   The  version  file  is
       loaded in a nested scope in which the following variables have been defined:

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_NAME</b>
              The <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b>

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION</b>
              Full requested version string

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR</b>
              Major version if requested, else 0

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR</b>
              Minor version if requested, else 0

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH</b>
              Patch version if requested, else 0

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK</b>
              Tweak version if requested, else 0

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT</b>
              Number of version components, 0 to 4

       When a version range is specified, the above version variables will hold values based on the lower end of
       the  version  range.   This  is to preserve compatibility with packages that have not been implemented to
       expect version ranges.  In addition, the version range will be described by the following variables:

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_RANGE</b>
              Full requested version range string

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_RANGE_MIN</b>
              This specifies whether the lower end point of the version range should be  included  or  excluded.
              Currently, the only supported value for this variable is <b>INCLUDE</b>.

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_RANGE_MAX</b>
              This  specifies  whether  the upper end point of the version range should be included or excluded.
              The supported values for this variable are <b>INCLUDE</b> and <b>EXCLUDE</b>.

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MIN</b>
              Full requested version string of the lower end point of the range

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MIN_MAJOR</b>
              Major version of the lower end point if requested, else 0

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MIN_MINOR</b>
              Minor version of the lower end point if requested, else 0

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MIN_PATCH</b>
              Patch version of the lower end point if requested, else 0

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MIN_TWEAK</b>
              Tweak version of the lower end point if requested, else 0

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MIN_COUNT</b>
              Number of version components of the lower end point, 0 to 4

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAX</b>
              Full requested version string of the upper end point of the range

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAX_MAJOR</b>
              Major version of the upper end point if requested, else 0

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAX_MINOR</b>
              Minor version of the upper end point if requested, else 0

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAX_PATCH</b>
              Patch version of the upper end point if requested, else 0

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAX_TWEAK</b>
              Tweak version of the upper end point if requested, else 0

       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAX_COUNT</b>
              Number of version components of the upper end point, 0 to 4

       Regardless  of  whether  a  single  version   or   a   version   range   is   specified,   the   variable
       <b>PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COMPLETE</b>  will  be  defined  and  will  hold  the  full  requested version string as
       specified.

       The version file checks whether it satisfies the requested version and sets these variables:

       <b>PACKAGE_VERSION</b>
              Full provided version string

       <b>PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT</b>
              True if version is exact match

       <b>PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE</b>
              True if version is compatible

       <b>PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE</b>
              True if unsuitable as any version

       These variables are checked by the <b>find_package</b> command  to  determine  whether  the  configuration  file
       provides  an  acceptable  version.   They  are not available after the <b>find_package</b> call returns.  If the
       version is acceptable the following variables are set:

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_VERSION</b>
              Full provided version string

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR</b>
              Major version if provided, else 0

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_VERSION_MINOR</b>
              Minor version if provided, else 0

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_VERSION_PATCH</b>
              Patch version if provided, else 0

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_VERSION_TWEAK</b>
              Tweak version if provided, else 0

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_VERSION_COUNT</b>
              Number of version components, 0 to 4

       and the corresponding package configuration file is loaded.

   <b>Package</b> <b>File</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Variables</b>
       When loading a find module or package  configuration  file  <b>find_package</b>  defines  variables  to  provide
       information about the call arguments (and restores their original state before returning):

       <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME</b>
              The <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> which is searched for

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED</b>
              True if <b>REQUIRED</b> option was given

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_QUIETLY</b>
              True if <b>QUIET</b> option was given

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_REGISTRY_VIEW</b>
              The requested view if <b>REGISTRY_VIEW</b> option was given

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_VERSION</b>
              Full requested version string

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR</b>
              Major version if requested, else 0

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MINOR</b>
              Minor version if requested, else 0

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_VERSION_PATCH</b>
              Patch version if requested, else 0

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK</b>
              Tweak version if requested, else 0

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_VERSION_COUNT</b>
              Number of version components, 0 to 4

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_VERSION_EXACT</b>
              True if <b>EXACT</b> option was given

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_COMPONENTS</b>
              List of specified components (required and optional)

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED_&lt;c&gt;</b>
              True if component <b>&lt;c&gt;</b> is required, false if component <b>&lt;c&gt;</b> is optional

       When a version range is specified, the above version variables will hold values based on the lower end of
       the  version  range.   This  is to preserve compatibility with packages that have not been implemented to
       expect version ranges.  In addition, the version range will be described by the following variables:

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_VERSION_RANGE</b>
              Full requested version range string

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_VERSION_RANGE_MIN</b>
              This specifies whether the lower  end  point  of  the  version  range  is  included  or  excluded.
              Currently, <b>INCLUDE</b> is the only supported value.

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_VERSION_RANGE_MAX</b>
              This  specifies  whether  the  upper  end point of the version range is included or excluded.  The
              possible values for this variable are <b>INCLUDE</b> or <b>EXCLUDE</b>.

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MIN</b>

       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MAX_COUNT</b>
              Number of version components of the upper end point, 0 to 4

       Regardless  of  whether  a  single  version   or   a   version   range   is   specified,   the   variable
       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FIND_VERSION_COMPLETE</b>  will  be  defined and will hold the full requested version string as
       specified.

       In Module mode the loaded find module is responsible to honor the request detailed  by  these  variables;
       see  the  find  module  for  details.  In Config mode <b>find_package</b> handles <b>REQUIRED</b>, <b>QUIET</b>, and <b>[version]</b>
       options automatically but leaves it to the package configuration file to handle components in a way  that
       makes sense for the package.  The package configuration file may set <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FOUND</b> to false to tell
       <b>find_package</b> that component requirements are not satisfied.

   <b>find_path</b>
       A short-hand signature is:

       The general signature is:

                   )

       This  command is used to find a directory containing the named file.  A cache entry, or a normal variable
       if <b>NO_CACHE</b> is specified, named by <b>&lt;VAR&gt;</b> is created to store the result of this command.  If the file  in
       a  directory is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the
       variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be <b>&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND</b>.

       Options include:

       <b>NAMES</b>  Specify one or more possible names for the file in a directory.

              When using this to specify names with and without a version suffix, we  recommend  specifying  the
              unversioned  name  first  so  that  locally-built  packages  can be found before those provided by
              distributions.

       <b>HINTS,</b> <b>PATHS</b>
              Specify directories to search in addition to the default locations.  The <b>ENV</b> <b>var</b> sub-option  reads
              paths from a system environment variable.

              Changed  in  version 3.24: On <b>Windows</b> platform, it is possible to include registry queries as part
              of the directories, using a <u>dedicated</u> <u>syntax</u>.  Such specifications will be ignored  on  all  other
              platforms.

       <b>REGISTRY_VIEW</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Specify  which registry views must be queried. This option is only meaningful on <b>Windows</b> platforms
              and will be ignored on other ones. When not specified, the <b>TARGET</b> view is used  when  the  <u>CMP0134</u>
              policy is <b>NEW</b>. Refer to <u>CMP0134</u> for the default view when the policy is <b>OLD</b>.

              <b>64</b>     Query   the   64-bit   registry.   On   32-bit   Windows,  it  always  returns  the  string
                     <b>/REGISTRY-NOTFOUND</b>.

              <b>32</b>     Query the 32-bit registry.

              <b>64_32</b>  Query both views (<b>64</b> and <b>32</b>) and generate a path for each.

              <b>32_64</b>  Query both views (<b>32</b> and <b>64</b>) and generate a path for each.

              <b>HOST</b>   Query the registry matching the architecture of the host: <b>64</b> on 64-bit Windows  and  <b>32</b>  on
                     32-bit Windows.

              <b>TARGET</b> Query the registry matching the architecture specified by the <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u> variable.
                     If not defined, fall back to <b>HOST</b> view.

              <b>BOTH</b>   Query  both  views  (<b>32</b>  and  <b>64</b>).  The  order  depends  on  the  following  rules:  If the
                     <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u> variable is defined, use the following view depending on the content of
                     this variable:

                     • <b>8</b>: <b>64_32</b>

                     • <b>4</b>: <b>32_64</b>

                     If the <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u> variable is not defined, rely on the architecture of the host:

                     • 64-bit: <b>64_32</b>

                     • 32-bit: <b>32</b>

       <b>PATH_SUFFIXES</b>
              Specify additional subdirectories to check below each directory location otherwise considered.

       <b>VALIDATOR</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              Specify a <u>function()</u> to be called for each candidate item found (a  <u>macro()</u>  cannot  be  provided,
              that  will  result in an error).  Two arguments will be passed to the validator function: the name
              of a result variable, and the absolute path to the candidate item.  The item will be accepted  and
              the  search  will  end  unless  the function sets the value in the result variable to false in the
              calling scope.  The result variable will hold a true value when the validator function is entered.

                 function(my_check validator_result_var item)
                   if(NOT item MATCHES ...)
                     set(${validator_result_var} FALSE PARENT_SCOPE)
                   endif()
                 endfunction()

                 find_path (result NAMES ... VALIDATOR my_check)

              Note that if a cached result is used, the search is skipped and any  <b>VALIDATOR</b>  is  ignored.   The
              cached result is not required to pass the validation function.

       <b>DOC</b>    Specify the documentation string for the <b>&lt;VAR&gt;</b> cache entry.

       <b>NO_CACHE</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              The result of the search will be stored in a normal variable rather than a cache entry.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If  the variable is already set before the call (as a normal or cache variable) then the search
                 will not occur.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 This option should be used with caution because it can greatly increase the  cost  of  repeated
                 configure steps.

       <b>REQUIRED</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              Stop  processing with an error message if nothing is found, otherwise the search will be attempted
              again the next time find_path is invoked with the same variable.

       If <b>NO_DEFAULT_PATH</b> is specified, then no additional paths are added to the search.  If <b>NO_DEFAULT_PATH</b> is
       not specified, the search process is as follows:

       1. If  called  from  within   a   find   module   or   any   other   script   loaded   by   a   call   to
          <u>find_package(&lt;PackageName&gt;)</u>,  search  prefixes  unique to the current package being found.  See policy
          <u>CMP0074</u>.

          Added in version 3.12.

          Specifically, search paths specified by the following variables, in order:

          a. <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> CMake variable, where <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> is the case-preserved package name.

          b. <u>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;_ROOT</u> CMake variable, where <b>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;</b> is the upper-cased package name.  See policy
             <u>CMP0144</u>.

             Added in version 3.27.

          c. <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> environment variable, where <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> is the case-preserved package name.

          d. <u>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;_ROOT</u> environment variable, where <b>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;</b> is the upper-cased package name.   See
             policy <u>CMP0144</u>.

             Added in version 3.27.

          The  package root variables are maintained as a stack, so if called from nested find modules or config
          packages, root paths from the parent's find module or config package will be searched after paths from
          the current module or package.  In other words,  the  search  order  would  be  <b>&lt;CurrentPackage&gt;_ROOT</b>,
          <b>ENV{&lt;CurrentPackage&gt;_ROOT}</b>, <b>&lt;ParentPackage&gt;_ROOT</b>, <b>ENV{&lt;ParentPackage&gt;_ROOT}</b>, etc.  This can be skipped
          if <b>NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH</b> is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt;</b> if <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u> is set, and <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include</b> for each <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>
            in  the  <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> CMake variable and the <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> environment variable if called
            from within a find module loaded by <u>find_package(&lt;PackageName&gt;)</u>

       2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.  These  are  intended  to  be  used  on  the
          command  line  with a <b>-DVAR=value</b>.  The values are interpreted as <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>lists</u>.  This can
          be skipped if <b>NO_CMAKE_PATH</b> is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt;</b> if <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u> is set, and <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include</b> for each <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>
            in <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</u>

       3. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.  These are intended to be set  in  the
          user's  shell configuration, and therefore use the host's native path separator (<b>;</b> on Windows and <b>:</b> on
          UNIX).   This  can  be  skipped  if  <b>NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</b>   is   passed   or   by   setting   the
          <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt;</b> if <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u> is set, and <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include</b> for each <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>
            in <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</u>

       4. Search  the  paths  specified  by  the  <b>HINTS</b>  option.   These  should  be  paths  computed  by system
          introspection, such as a hint provided by the location of  another  item  already  found.   Hard-coded
          guesses should be specified with the <b>PATHS</b> option.

       5. Search  the  standard system environment variables.  This can be skipped if <b>NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</b>
          is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • The directories in <b>INCLUDE</b> and <b>PATH</b>.

          On Windows hosts, CMake  3.3  through  3.27  searched  additional  paths:  <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt;</b>  if
          <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u>  is  set,  and  <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include</b>  for  each  <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin</b>  in  <b>PATH</b>, and
          <b>&lt;entry&gt;/include</b> for other entries in <b>PATH</b>.  This behavior was removed by CMake 3.28.

       6. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform  files  for  the  current  system.   The  searching  of
          <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b>  and  <b>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</b> can be skipped if <b>NO_CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b> is passed or
          by setting the  <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>  to  <b>FALSE</b>.  All  these  locations  can  be  skipped  if
          <b>NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH</b> is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt;</b> if <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u> is set, and <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include</b> for each <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>
            in <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</u>

          The  platform  paths  that  these  variables  contain  are  locations that typically include installed
          software. An example being <b><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></b> for UNIX based platforms.

       7. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in the short-hand version of the command.  These are
          typically hard-coded guesses.

       The        <u>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH</u>,        <u>CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</u>,        <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH</u>        and
       <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</u> variables can also cause some of the above locations to be ignored.

       Added  in version 3.16: Added <b>CMAKE_FIND_USE_&lt;CATEGORY&gt;_PATH</b> variables to globally disable various search
       locations.

       On macOS the <u>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</u> and <u>CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE</u> variables determine the  order  of  preference
       between Apple-style and unix-style package components.

       The  CMake  variable  <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other
       search directories.  This effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given  locations.   Paths  which
       are  descendants  of the <u>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</u> are excluded from this re-rooting, because that variable is
       always a path on the host system.  By default the <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> is empty.

       The <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> variable can also be used to specify exactly one directory to use as a prefix.  Setting
       <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> also has other effects.  See the documentation for that variable for more.

       These variables are especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of  the  target
       environment  and  CMake  will  search  there  too.   By  default  at  first  the  directories  listed  in
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> are searched, then the <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> directory is searched, and then the  non-rooted
       directories    will    be    searched.     The    default   behavior   can   be   adjusted   by   setting
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE</u>.  This behavior can be manually overridden on a  per-call  basis  using
       options:

       <b>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH</b>
              Search in the order described above.

       <b>NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</b>
              Do not use the <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> variable.

       <b>ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</b>
              Search only the re-rooted directories and directories below <u>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</u>.

       The  default  search  order  is  designed  to  be  most-specific  to least-specific for common use cases.
       Projects may override the order by simply calling the command multiple times and using the <b>NO_*</b> options:

          find_path (&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
          find_path (&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)

       Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and stored in the cache so  that  no  call
       will search again.

       When searching for frameworks, if the file is specified as <b>A/b.h</b>, then the framework search will look for
       <b>A.framework/Headers/b.h</b>.  If that is found the path will be set to the path to the framework.  CMake will
       convert this to the correct <b>-F</b> option to include the file.

   <b>find_program</b>
       A short-hand signature is:

          find_program (&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])

       The general signature is:

          find_program (
                    &lt;VAR&gt;
                    name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...] [NAMES_PER_DIR]

                     NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
                   )

       This  command  is  used to find a program.  A cache entry, or a normal variable if <b>NO_CACHE</b> is specified,
       named by <b>&lt;VAR&gt;</b> is created to store the result of this command.  If the program is  found  the  result  is
       stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is
       found, the result will be <b>&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND</b>.

       Options include:

       <b>NAMES</b>  Specify one or more possible names for the program.

              When  using  this  to specify names with and without a version suffix, we recommend specifying the
              unversioned name first so that locally-built packages  can  be  found  before  those  provided  by
              distributions.

       <b>HINTS,</b> <b>PATHS</b>
              Specify  directories to search in addition to the default locations.  The <b>ENV</b> <b>var</b> sub-option reads
              paths from a system environment variable.

              Changed in version 3.24: On <b>Windows</b> platform, it is possible to include registry queries  as  part
              of  the  directories,  using a <u>dedicated</u> <u>syntax</u>.  Such specifications will be ignored on all other
              platforms.

       <b>REGISTRY_VIEW</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Specify which registry views must be queried. This option is only meaningful on <b>Windows</b>  platforms
              and  will  be  ignored  on  other ones. When not specified, the <b>BOTH</b> view is used when the <u>CMP0134</u>
              policy is <b>NEW</b>. Refer to <u>CMP0134</u> for the default view when the policy is <b>OLD</b>.

              <b>64</b>     Query  the  64-bit  registry.  On  32-bit   Windows,   it   always   returns   the   string
                     <b>/REGISTRY-NOTFOUND</b>.

              <b>32</b>     Query the 32-bit registry.

              <b>64_32</b>  Query both views (<b>64</b> and <b>32</b>) and generate a path for each.

              <b>32_64</b>  Query both views (<b>32</b> and <b>64</b>) and generate a path for each.

              <b>HOST</b>   Query  the  registry  matching the architecture of the host: <b>64</b> on 64-bit Windows and <b>32</b> on
                     32-bit Windows.

              <b>TARGET</b> Query the registry matching the architecture specified by the <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u> variable.
                     If not defined, fall back to <b>HOST</b> view.

              <b>BOTH</b>   Query both  views  (<b>32</b>  and  <b>64</b>).  The  order  depends  on  the  following  rules:  If  the
                     <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u> variable is defined, use the following view depending on the content of
                     this variable:

                     • <b>8</b>: <b>64_32</b>

                     • <b>4</b>: <b>32_64</b>

                     If the <u>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</u> variable is not defined, rely on the architecture of the host:

                     • 64-bit: <b>64_32</b>

                     • 32-bit: <b>32</b>

       <b>PATH_SUFFIXES</b>
              Specify additional subdirectories to check below each directory location otherwise considered.

       <b>VALIDATOR</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              Specify  a  <u>function()</u>  to  be called for each candidate item found (a <u>macro()</u> cannot be provided,
              that will result in an error).  Two arguments will be passed to the validator function:  the  name
              of  a result variable, and the absolute path to the candidate item.  The item will be accepted and
              the search will end unless the function sets the value in the result  variable  to  false  in  the
              calling scope.  The result variable will hold a true value when the validator function is entered.

                 function(my_check validator_result_var item)
                   if(NOT item MATCHES ...)
                     set(${validator_result_var} FALSE PARENT_SCOPE)
                   endif()
                 endfunction()

                 find_program (result NAMES ... VALIDATOR my_check)

              Note  that  if  a  cached result is used, the search is skipped and any <b>VALIDATOR</b> is ignored.  The
              cached result is not required to pass the validation function.

       <b>DOC</b>    Specify the documentation string for the <b>&lt;VAR&gt;</b> cache entry.

       <b>NO_CACHE</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              The result of the search will be stored in a normal variable rather than a cache entry.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If the variable is already set before the call (as a normal or cache variable) then the  search
                 will not occur.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 This  option  should  be used with caution because it can greatly increase the cost of repeated
                 configure steps.

       <b>REQUIRED</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              Stop processing with an error message if nothing is found, otherwise the search will be  attempted
              again the next time find_program is invoked with the same variable.

       If <b>NO_DEFAULT_PATH</b> is specified, then no additional paths are added to the search.  If <b>NO_DEFAULT_PATH</b> is
       not specified, the search process is as follows:

       1. If   called   from   within   a   find   module   or   any   other   script   loaded   by  a  call  to
          <u>find_package(&lt;PackageName&gt;)</u>, search prefixes unique to the current package being  found.   See  policy
          <u>CMP0074</u>.

          Added in version 3.12.

          Specifically, search paths specified by the following variables, in order:

          a. <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> CMake variable, where <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> is the case-preserved package name.

          b. <u>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;_ROOT</u> CMake variable, where <b>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;</b> is the upper-cased package name.  See policy
             <u>CMP0144</u>.

             Added in version 3.27.

          c. <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> environment variable, where <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> is the case-preserved package name.

          d. <u>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;_ROOT</u>  environment variable, where <b>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;</b> is the upper-cased package name.  See
             policy <u>CMP0144</u>.

             Added in version 3.27.

          The package root variables are maintained as a stack, so if called from nested find modules or  config
          packages, root paths from the parent's find module or config package will be searched after paths from
          the  current  module  or  package.   In  other words, the search order would be <b>&lt;CurrentPackage&gt;_ROOT</b>,
          <b>ENV{&lt;CurrentPackage&gt;_ROOT}</b>, <b>&lt;ParentPackage&gt;_ROOT</b>, <b>ENV{&lt;ParentPackage&gt;_ROOT}</b>, etc.  This can be skipped
          if <b>NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH</b> is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin</b>  for  each   <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>   in   the   <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u>   CMake   variable   and   the
            <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u>   environment   variable   if   called  from  within  a  find  module  loaded  by
            <u>find_package(&lt;PackageName&gt;)</u>

       2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.  These  are  intended  to  be  used  on  the
          command  line  with a <b>-DVAR=value</b>.  The values are interpreted as <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>lists</u>.  This can
          be skipped if <b>NO_CMAKE_PATH</b> is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin</b> for each <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b> in <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</u>

       3. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.  These are intended to be set  in  the
          user's  shell configuration, and therefore use the host's native path separator (<b>;</b> on Windows and <b>:</b> on
          UNIX).   This  can  be  skipped  if  <b>NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</b>   is   passed   or   by   setting   the
          <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin</b> for each <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b> in <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</u>

       4. Search  the  paths  specified  by  the  <b>HINTS</b>  option.   These  should  be  paths  computed  by system
          introspection, such as a hint provided by the location of  another  item  already  found.   Hard-coded
          guesses should be specified with the <b>PATHS</b> option.

       5. Search  the  standard system environment variables.  This can be skipped if <b>NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</b>
          is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • The directories in <b>PATH</b> itself.

       6. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform  files  for  the  current  system.   The  searching  of
          <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b>  and  <b>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</b> can be skipped if <b>NO_CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b> is passed or
          by setting the  <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>  to  <b>FALSE</b>.  All  these  locations  can  be  skipped  if
          <b>NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH</b> is passed or by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.

          • <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin</b> for each <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b> in <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH</u>

          • <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH</u>

          The  platform  paths  that  these  variables  contain  are  locations that typically include installed
          software. An example being <b><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></b> for UNIX based platforms.

       7. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in the short-hand version of the command.  These are
          typically hard-coded guesses.

       The        <u>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH</u>,        <u>CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</u>,        <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH</u>        and
       <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</u> variables can also cause some of the above locations to be ignored.

       Added  in version 3.16: Added <b>CMAKE_FIND_USE_&lt;CATEGORY&gt;_PATH</b> variables to globally disable various search
       locations.

       On macOS the <u>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</u> and <u>CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE</u> variables determine the  order  of  preference
       between Apple-style and unix-style package components.

       The  CMake  variable  <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other
       search directories.  This effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given  locations.   Paths  which
       are  descendants  of the <u>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</u> are excluded from this re-rooting, because that variable is
       always a path on the host system.  By default the <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> is empty.

       The <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> variable can also be used to specify exactly one directory to use as a prefix.  Setting
       <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> also has other effects.  See the documentation for that variable for more.

       These variables are especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of  the  target
       environment  and  CMake  will  search  there  too.   By  default  at  first  the  directories  listed  in
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> are searched, then the <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> directory is searched, and then the  non-rooted
       directories    will    be    searched.     The    default   behavior   can   be   adjusted   by   setting
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM</u>.  This behavior can be manually overridden on a  per-call  basis  using
       options:

       <b>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH</b>
              Search in the order described above.

       <b>NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</b>
              Do not use the <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> variable.

       <b>ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</b>
              Search only the re-rooted directories and directories below <u>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</u>.

       The  default  search  order  is  designed  to  be  most-specific  to least-specific for common use cases.
       Projects may override the order by simply calling the command multiple times and using the <b>NO_*</b> options:

          find_program (&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
          find_program (&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)

       Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and stored in the cache so  that  no  call
       will search again.

       When more than one value is given to the <b>NAMES</b> option this command by default will consider one name at a
       time  and  search  every  directory  for it.  The <b>NAMES_PER_DIR</b> option tells this command to consider one
       directory at a time and search for all names in it.

       The set of files considered to be programs is platform-specific:

       • On Windows, filename suffixes are considered in order <b>.com</b>, <b>.exe</b>, and no suffix.

       • On non-Windows systems, no filename suffix is considered, but files must have execute  permission  (see
         policy <u>CMP0109</u>).

       To search for scripts, specify an extension explicitly:

          if(WIN32)
            set(_script_suffix .bat)
          else()
            set(_script_suffix .sh)
          endif()

          find_program(MY_SCRIPT NAMES my_script${_script_suffix})

   <b>foreach</b>
       Evaluate a group of commands for each value in a list.

          foreach(&lt;loop_var&gt; &lt;items&gt;)
            &lt;commands&gt;
          endforeach()

       where  <b>&lt;items&gt;</b>  is  a  list of items that are separated by semicolon or whitespace.  All commands between
       <b>foreach</b> and the matching  <b>endforeach</b>  are  recorded  without  being  invoked.   Once  the  <b>endforeach</b>  is
       evaluated,  the  recorded list of commands is invoked once for each item in <b>&lt;items&gt;</b>.  At the beginning of
       each iteration the variable <b>&lt;loop_var&gt;</b> will be set to the value of the current item.

       The scope of <b>&lt;loop_var&gt;</b> is restricted to the loop scope. See policy <u>CMP0124</u> for details.

       The commands <u>break()</u> and <u>continue()</u> provide means to escape from the normal control flow.

       Per legacy, the <u>endforeach()</u> command admits an optional <b>&lt;loop_var&gt;</b> argument.   If  used,  it  must  be  a
       verbatim repeat of the argument of the opening <b>foreach</b> command.

          foreach(&lt;loop_var&gt; RANGE &lt;stop&gt;)

       In  this  variant,  <b>foreach</b>  iterates  over  the  numbers 0, 1, ... up to (and including) the nonnegative
       integer <b>&lt;stop&gt;</b>.

          foreach(&lt;loop_var&gt; RANGE &lt;start&gt; &lt;stop&gt; [&lt;step&gt;])

       In this variant, <b>foreach</b> iterates over the numbers from <b>&lt;start&gt;</b> up to at most <b>&lt;stop&gt;</b> in steps of  <b>&lt;step&gt;</b>.
       If  <b>&lt;step&gt;</b> is not specified, then the step size is 1.  The three arguments <b>&lt;start&gt;</b> <b>&lt;stop&gt;</b> <b>&lt;step&gt;</b> must all
       be nonnegative integers, and <b>&lt;stop&gt;</b> must not be smaller than <b>&lt;start&gt;</b>; otherwise you enter the danger zone
       of undocumented behavior that may change in future releases.

          foreach(&lt;loop_var&gt; IN [LISTS [&lt;lists&gt;]] [ITEMS [&lt;items&gt;]])

       In this variant, <b>&lt;lists&gt;</b> is a whitespace or  semicolon  separated  list  of  list-valued  variables.  The
       <b>foreach</b>  command iterates over each item in each given list.  The <b>&lt;items&gt;</b> following the <b>ITEMS</b> keyword are
       processed as in the first variant of the  <b>foreach</b>  command.   The  forms  <b>LISTS</b>  <b>A</b>  and  <b>ITEMS</b>  <b>${A}</b>  are
       equivalent.

       The following example shows how the <b>LISTS</b> option is processed:

          set(A 0;1)
          set(B 2 3)
          set(C "4 5")
          set(D 6;7 8)
          set(E "")
          foreach(X IN LISTS A B C D E)
              message(STATUS "X=${X}")
          endforeach()

       yields:

          -- X=0
          -- X=1
          -- X=2
          -- X=3
          -- X=4 5
          -- X=6
          -- X=7
          -- X=8

          foreach(&lt;loop_var&gt;... IN ZIP_LISTS &lt;lists&gt;)

       Added in version 3.17.

       In  this  variant,  <b>&lt;lists&gt;</b>  is  a  whitespace  or semicolon separated list of list-valued variables. The
       <b>foreach</b> command iterates over each list simultaneously setting the iteration variables as follows:

       • if the only <b>loop_var</b> given, then it sets a series of <b>loop_var_N</b> variables to the current item from  the
         corresponding list;

       • if multiple variable names passed, their count should match the lists variables count;

       • if  any  of  the lists are shorter, the corresponding iteration variable is not defined for the current
         iteration.

          list(APPEND English one two three four)
          list(APPEND Bahasa satu dua tiga)

          foreach(num IN ZIP_LISTS English Bahasa)
              message(STATUS "num_0=${num_0}, num_1=${num_1}")
          endforeach()

          foreach(en ba IN ZIP_LISTS English Bahasa)
              message(STATUS "en=${en}, ba=${ba}")
          endforeach()

       yields:

          -- num_0=one, num_1=satu
          -- num_0=two, num_1=dua
          -- num_0=three, num_1=tiga
          -- num_0=four, num_1=
          -- en=one, ba=satu
          -- en=two, ba=dua
          -- en=three, ba=tiga
          -- en=four, ba=

   <b>function</b>
       Start recording a function for later invocation as a command.

          function(&lt;name&gt; [&lt;arg1&gt; ...])
            &lt;commands&gt;
          endfunction()

       Defines a function named <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> that takes arguments named <b>&lt;arg1&gt;</b>, ...  The <b>&lt;commands&gt;</b>  in  the  function
       definition are recorded; they are not executed until the function is invoked.

       Per  legacy, the <u>endfunction()</u> command admits an optional <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> argument. If used, it must be a verbatim
       repeat of the argument of the opening <b>function</b> command.

       A function opens a new scope: see <u>set(var</u> <u>PARENT_SCOPE)</u> for details.

       See the <u>cmake_policy()</u> command documentation for the behavior of policies inside functions.

       See the <u>macro()</u> command documentation for differences between CMake functions and macros.

   <b>Invocation</b>
       The function invocation is case-insensitive. A function defined as

          function(foo)
            &lt;commands&gt;
          endfunction()

       can be invoked through any of

          foo()
          Foo()
          FOO()
          cmake_language(CALL foo)

       and so on. However, it is strongly recommended to stay with the case chosen in the  function  definition.
       Typically functions use all-lowercase names.

       Added in version 3.18: The <u>cmake_language(CALL</u> <u>...)</u> command can also be used to invoke the function.

   <b>Arguments</b>
       When  the  function is invoked, the recorded <b>&lt;commands&gt;</b> are first modified by replacing formal parameters
       (<b>${arg1}</b>, ...) with the arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands.

       In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the <b>ARGC</b> variable which will be set to
       the number of arguments passed into the function as well as <b>ARGV0</b>, <b>ARGV1</b>, <b>ARGV2</b>, ...  which will have the
       actual values of the arguments passed in.  This facilitates creating functions with optional arguments.

       Furthermore, <b>ARGV</b> holds the list of all arguments given to the  function  and  <b>ARGN</b>  holds  the  list  of
       arguments  past  the  last  expected argument.  Referencing to <b>ARGV#</b> arguments beyond <b>ARGC</b> have undefined
       behavior.  Checking that <b>ARGC</b> is greater than <b>#</b> is the only way to ensure that <b>ARGV#</b> was  passed  to  the
       function as an extra argument.

   <b>get_cmake_property</b>
       Get a global property of the CMake instance.

          get_cmake_property(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;property&gt;)

       Gets  a  global property from the CMake instance.  The value of the <b>&lt;property&gt;</b> is stored in the specified
       <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.   If  the  property  is  not  found,  <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>  will  be  set   to   <b>NOTFOUND</b>.    See   the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-properties.7.html">cmake-properties</a>(7)</u> manual for available properties.

       In  addition  to global properties, this command (for historical reasons) also supports the <u>VARIABLES</u> and
       <u>MACROS</u> directory properties.  It also supports a  special  <b>COMPONENTS</b>  global  property  that  lists  the
       components given to the <u>install()</u> command.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • the <u>get_property()</u> command <b>GLOBAL</b> option

   <b>get_directory_property</b>
       Get a property of <b>DIRECTORY</b> scope.

          get_directory_property(&lt;variable&gt; [DIRECTORY &lt;dir&gt;] &lt;prop-name&gt;)

       Stores a property of directory scope in the named <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.

       The  <b>DIRECTORY</b>  argument specifies another directory from which to retrieve the property value instead of
       the current directory.  Relative paths are treated as relative to the current  source  directory.   CMake
       must  already know about the directory, either by having added it through a call to <u>add_subdirectory()</u> or
       being the top level directory.

       Added in version 3.19: <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> may reference a binary directory.

       If the property is not defined for the nominated directory scope, an empty string is  returned.   In  the
       case  of <b>INHERITED</b> properties, if the property is not found for the nominated directory scope, the search
       will chain to a parent scope as described for the <u>define_property()</u> command.

          get_directory_property(&lt;variable&gt; [DIRECTORY &lt;dir&gt;]
                                 DEFINITION &lt;var-name&gt;)

       Get a variable definition from a directory.  This form is  useful  to  get  a  variable  definition  from
       another directory.

   <b>get_filename_component</b>
       Get a specific component of a full filename.

       Changed  in  version  3.20:  This  command  has  been  superseded by the <u>cmake_path()</u> command, except for
       <b>REALPATH</b>,   which   is   now   offered   by   <u>file(REAL_PATH)</u>,   and   <b>PROGRAM</b>,    now    available    in
       <u>separate_arguments(PROGRAM)</u>.

       Changed  in  version 3.24: The undocumented feature offering the capability to query the <b>Windows</b> registry
       is superseded by <u>cmake_host_system_information(QUERY</u> <u>WINDOWS_REGISTRY)</u> command.

          get_filename_component(&lt;var&gt; &lt;FileName&gt; &lt;mode&gt; [CACHE])

       Sets <b>&lt;var&gt;</b> to a component of <b>&lt;FileName&gt;</b>, where <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b> is one of:

          DIRECTORY = Directory without file name
          NAME      = File name without directory
          EXT       = File name longest extension (.b.c from d/a.b.c)
          NAME_WE   = File name with neither the directory nor the longest extension
          LAST_EXT  = File name last extension (.c from d/a.b.c)
          NAME_WLE  = File name with neither the directory nor the last extension
          PATH      = Legacy alias for DIRECTORY (use for CMake &lt;= 2.8.11)

       Added in version 3.14: Added the <b>LAST_EXT</b> and <b>NAME_WLE</b> modes.

       Paths are returned with forward slashes and have no trailing slashes.  If the optional <b>CACHE</b> argument  is
       specified, the result variable is added to the cache.

          get_filename_component(&lt;var&gt; &lt;FileName&gt; &lt;mode&gt; [BASE_DIR &lt;dir&gt;] [CACHE])

       Added in version 3.4.

       Sets <b>&lt;var&gt;</b> to the absolute path of <b>&lt;FileName&gt;</b>, where <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b> is one of:

          ABSOLUTE  = Full path to file
          REALPATH  = Full path to existing file with symlinks resolved

       If  the  provided  <b>&lt;FileName&gt;</b>  is  a  relative path, it is evaluated relative to the given base directory
       <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>.  If no base directory is provided, the default base directory will be <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>.

       Paths are returned with forward slashes and have no trailing slashes.  If the optional <b>CACHE</b> argument  is
       specified, the result variable is added to the cache.

          get_filename_component(&lt;var&gt; &lt;FileName&gt; PROGRAM [PROGRAM_ARGS &lt;arg_var&gt;] [CACHE])

       The  program  in  <b>&lt;FileName&gt;</b>  will  be  found  in  the  system  search  path  or left as a full path.  If
       <b>PROGRAM_ARGS</b> is present with <b>PROGRAM</b>, then any command-line arguments present in  the  <b>&lt;FileName&gt;</b>  string
       are  split  from  the program name and stored in <b>&lt;arg_var&gt;</b>.  This is used to separate a program name from
       its arguments in a command line string.

                       [SET | DEFINED | BRIEF_DOCS | FULL_DOCS])

       Gets one property from one object in a scope.

       The first argument specifies the variable in which to store the result.  The second  argument  determines
       the scope from which to get the property.  It must be one of the following:

       <b>GLOBAL</b> Scope is unique and does not accept a name.

       <b>DIRECTORY</b>
              Scope defaults to the current directory, but another directory (already processed by CMake) may be
              named  by  the full or relative path <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>.  Relative paths are treated as relative to the current
              source directory.  See also the <u>get_directory_property()</u> command.

              Added in version 3.19: <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> may reference a binary directory.

       <b>TARGET</b> Scope must name one existing target.  See also the <u>get_target_property()</u> command.

       <b>SOURCE</b> Scope must name one source file.  By default, the source file's property will  be  read  from  the
              current source directory's scope.

              Added in version 3.18: Directory scope can be overridden with one of the following sub-options:

              <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                     The source file property will be read from the <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> directory's scope.  CMake must already
                     know about the directory, either by having added it through a call to <u>add_subdirectory()</u> or
                     <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> being the top level directory.  Relative paths are treated as relative to the current
                     source directory.

                     Added in version 3.19: <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> may reference a binary directory.

              <b>TARGET_DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>
                     The  source  file  property  will  be  read  from the directory scope in which <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> was
                     created (<b>&lt;target&gt;</b> must therefore already exist).

              See also the <u>get_source_file_property()</u> command.

       <b>INSTALL</b>
              Added in version 3.1.

              Scope must name one installed file path.

       <b>TEST</b>   Scope must name one existing test.  See also the <u>get_test_property()</u> command.

              Added in version 3.28: Directory scope can be overridden with the following sub-option:

              <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                     The test property will be read from the <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> directory's scope.  CMake must  already  know
                     about  the  directory,  either  by  having added it through a call to <u>add_subdirectory()</u> or
                     <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> being the top level directory. Relative paths are treated as relative to the  current
                     source directory. <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> may reference a binary directory.

       <b>CACHE</b>  Scope must name one cache entry.

       <b>VARIABLE</b>
              Scope is unique and does not accept a name.

       The required <b>PROPERTY</b> option is immediately followed by the name of the property to get.  If the property
       is not set, the named <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> will be unset in the calling scope upon return, although some properties
       support inheriting from a parent scope if defined to behave that way (see <u>define_property()</u>).

       If  the  <b>SET</b>  option is given, the variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the property has
       been set.  If the <b>DEFINED</b> option is given, the variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether  the
       property has been defined, such as with the <u>define_property()</u> command.

       If  <b>BRIEF_DOCS</b>  or  <b>FULL_DOCS</b> is given, then the variable is set to a string containing documentation for
       the requested property.  If documentation is requested for a property that has not been defined, <b>NOTFOUND</b>
       is returned.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The <u>GENERATED</u> source file property may be globally visible.  See its documentation for details.

   <b>if</b>
       Conditionally execute a group of commands.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
          if(&lt;condition&gt;)
            &lt;commands&gt;
          elseif(&lt;condition&gt;) # optional block, can be repeated
            &lt;commands&gt;
          else()              # optional block
            &lt;commands&gt;
          endif()

       Evaluates the <b>condition</b> argument of the <b>if</b> clause according to the <u>Condition</u> <u>syntax</u> described  below.  If
       the  result  is  true, then the <b>commands</b> in the <b>if</b> block are executed.  Otherwise, optional <b>elseif</b> blocks
       are processed in the same way.  Finally, if no <b>condition</b> is true, <b>commands</b> in the optional <b>else</b> block are
       executed.

       Per legacy, the <u>else()</u> and <u>endif()</u> commands admit an optional <b>&lt;condition&gt;</b> argument.  If used, it must  be
       a verbatim repeat of the argument of the opening <b>if</b> command.

   <b>Condition</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       The following syntax applies to the <b>condition</b> argument of the <b>if</b>, <b>elseif</b> and <u>while()</u> clauses.

       Compound conditions are evaluated in the following order of precedence:

       1. <u>Parentheses</u>.

       2. Unary  tests  such  as <u>COMMAND</u>, <u>POLICY</u>, <u>TARGET</u>, <u>TEST</u>, <u>EXISTS</u>, <u>IS_READABLE</u>, <u>IS_WRITABLE</u>, <u>IS_EXECUTABLE</u>,
          <u>IS_DIRECTORY</u>, <u>IS_SYMLINK</u>, <u>IS_ABSOLUTE</u>, and <u>DEFINED</u>.

       3. Binary  tests  such  as  <u>EQUAL</u>,  <u>LESS</u>,  <u>LESS_EQUAL</u>,   <u>GREATER</u>,   <u>GREATER_EQUAL</u>,   <u>STREQUAL</u>,   <u>STRLESS</u>,
          <u>STRLESS_EQUAL</u>,   <u>STRGREATER</u>,   <u>STRGREATER_EQUAL</u>,   <u>VERSION_EQUAL</u>,   <u>VERSION_LESS</u>,  <u>VERSION_LESS_EQUAL</u>,
          <u>VERSION_GREATER</u>, <u>VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL</u>, <u>PATH_EQUAL</u>, <u>IN_LIST</u>, <u>IS_NEWER_THAN</u>, and <u>MATCHES</u>.

       4. Unary logical operator <u>NOT</u>.

       5. Binary logical operators <u>AND</u> and <u>OR</u>, from left to right, without any short-circuit.

   <b>Basic</b> <b>Expressions</b>
       <b>if(&lt;constant&gt;)</b>
              True if the constant is <b>1</b>, <b>ON</b>, <b>YES</b>, <b>TRUE</b>, <b>Y</b>,  or  a  non-zero  number  (including  floating  point
              numbers).   False  if the constant is <b>0</b>, <b>OFF</b>, <b>NO</b>, <b>FALSE</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>IGNORE</b>, <b>NOTFOUND</b>, the empty string, or
              ends in the suffix <b>-NOTFOUND</b>.  Named boolean constants are case-insensitive.  If the  argument  is
              not one of these specific constants, it is treated as a variable or string (see <u>Variable</u> <u>Expansion</u>
              further below) and one of the following two forms applies.

       <b>if(&lt;variable&gt;)</b>
              True  if  given  a  variable  that  is  defined  to  a  value that is not a false constant.  False
              otherwise, including if the variable is undefined.  Note that macro arguments are  not  variables.
              <u>Environment</u>  <u>Variables</u> also cannot be tested this way, e.g. <b>if(ENV{some_var})</b> will always evaluate
              to false.

       <b>if(&lt;string&gt;)</b>
              A quoted string always evaluates to false unless:

              • The string's value is one of the true constants, or

              • Policy <u>CMP0054</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b> and the string's value happens to be a variable  name  that  is
                affected by <u>CMP0054</u>'s behavior.

   <b>Logic</b> <b>Operators</b>
       <b>if(NOT</b> <b>&lt;condition&gt;)</b>
              True if the condition is not true.

       <b>if(&lt;cond1&gt;</b> <b>AND</b> <b>&lt;cond2&gt;)</b>
              True if both conditions would be considered true individually.

       <b>if(&lt;cond1&gt;</b> <b>OR</b> <b>&lt;cond2&gt;)</b>
              True if either condition would be considered true individually.

       <b>if((condition)</b> <b>AND</b> <b>(condition</b> <b>OR</b> <b>(condition)))</b>
              The  conditions  inside  the  parenthesis  are evaluated first and then the remaining condition is
              evaluated as in the other  examples.   Where  there  are  nested  parenthesis  the  innermost  are
              evaluated as part of evaluating the condition that contains them.

   <b>Existence</b> <b>Checks</b>
       <b>if(COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;command-name&gt;)</b>
              True if the given name is a command, macro or function that can be invoked.

       <b>if(POLICY</b> <b>&lt;policy-id&gt;)</b>
              True if the given name is an existing policy (of the form <b>CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;</b>).

       <b>if(TARGET</b> <b>&lt;target-name&gt;)</b>
              True  if  the  given  name  is  an  existing  logical  target  name  created  by  a  call  to  the
              <u>add_executable()</u>, <u>add_library()</u>, or <u>add_custom_target()</u> command that has already been invoked  (in
              any directory).

       <b>if(TEST</b> <b>&lt;test-name&gt;)</b>
              Added in version 3.3.

              True if the given name is an existing test name created by the <u>add_test()</u> command.

       <b>if(DEFINED</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;|CACHE{&lt;name&gt;}|ENV{&lt;name&gt;})</b>
                 True  if  a  variable, cache variable or environment variable with given <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> is defined. The
                 value of the variable does not matter. Note the following caveats:

                 • Macro arguments are not variables.

                 • It is not possible to test directly whether a <u>&lt;name&gt;</u> is a non-cache variable.  The expression
                   <b>if(DEFINED</b> <b>someName)</b> will evaluate to true if either a cache or non-cache  variable  <b>someName</b>
                   exists.  In comparison, the expression <b>if(DEFINED</b> <b>CACHE{someName})</b> will only evaluate to true
                   if  a cache variable <b>someName</b> exists.  Both expressions need to be tested if you need to know
                   whether a non-cache variable exists: <b>if(DEFINED</b> <b>someName</b> <b>AND</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>DEFINED</b> <b>CACHE{someName})</b>.

              Added in version 3.14: Added support for <b>CACHE{&lt;name&gt;}</b> variables.

       <b>if(&lt;variable|string&gt;</b> <b>IN_LIST</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;)</b>
              Added in version 3.3.

              True if the given element is contained in the named list variable.

   <b>File</b> <b>Operations</b>
       <b>if(EXISTS</b> <b>&lt;path-to-file-or-directory&gt;)</b>
              True if the named file or directory exists and is readable.  Behavior  is  well-defined  only  for
              explicit full paths (a leading <b>~/</b> is not expanded as a home directory and is considered a relative
              path).   Resolves  symbolic links, i.e. if the named file or directory is a symbolic link, returns
              true if the target of the symbolic link exists.

              False if the given path is an empty string.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Prefer <b>if(IS_READABLE)</b> to check file readability.  <b>if(EXISTS)</b> may be changed in the  future  to
                 only check file existence.

       <b>if(IS_READABLE</b> <b>&lt;path-to-file-or-directory&gt;)</b>
              Added in version 3.29.

              True  if the named file or directory is readable.  Behavior is well-defined only for explicit full
              paths (a leading <b>~/</b> is not expanded as a home  directory  and  is  considered  a  relative  path).
              Resolves  symbolic  links, i.e. if the named file or directory is a symbolic link, returns true if
              the target of the symbolic link is readable.

              False if the given path is an empty string.

       <b>if(IS_WRITABLE</b> <b>&lt;path-to-file-or-directory&gt;)</b>
              Added in version 3.29.

              True if the named file or directory is writable.  Behavior is well-defined only for explicit  full
              paths  (a  leading  <b>~/</b>  is  not  expanded  as a home directory and is considered a relative path).
              Resolves symbolic links, i.e. if the named file or directory is a symbolic link, returns  true  if
              the target of the symbolic link is writable.

              False if the given path is an empty string.

       <b>if(IS_EXECUTABLE</b> <b>&lt;path-to-file-or-directory&gt;)</b>
              Added in version 3.29.

              True  if  the  named  file or directory is executable.  Behavior is well-defined only for explicit
              full paths (a leading <b>~/</b> is not expanded as a home directory and is considered a  relative  path).
              Resolves  symbolic  links, i.e. if the named file or directory is a symbolic link, returns true if
              the target of the symbolic link is executable.

              False if the given path is an empty string.

       <b>if(&lt;file1&gt;</b> <b>IS_NEWER_THAN</b> <b>&lt;file2&gt;)</b>
              True if <b>file1</b> is newer than <b>file2</b> or  if  one  of  the  two  files  doesn't  exist.   Behavior  is
              well-defined  only for full paths.  If the file time stamps are exactly the same, an <b>IS_NEWER_THAN</b>
              comparison returns true, so that any dependent build operations will occur in the event of a  tie.
              This includes the case of passing the same file name for both file1 and file2.

       <b>if(IS_DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;)</b>
              True if <b>path</b> is a directory.  Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.

              False if the given path is an empty string.

       <b>if(IS_SYMLINK</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;)</b>
              True if the given path is a symbolic link.  Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.

       <b>if(IS_ABSOLUTE</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;)</b>
              True if the given path is an absolute path.  Note the following special cases:

              • An empty <b>path</b> evaluates to false.

              • On  Windows hosts, any <b>path</b> that begins with a drive letter and colon (e.g. <b>C:</b>), a forward slash
                or a backslash will evaluate to true.  This means a path like  <b>C:no\base\dir</b>  will  evaluate  to
                true, even though the non-drive part of the path is relative.

              • On non-Windows hosts, any <b>path</b> that begins with a tilde (<b>~</b>) evaluates to true.

              Component-wise integer version number comparison (version format is <b>major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]</b>,
              omitted components are treated  as  zero).   Any  non-integer  version  component  or  non-integer

   <b>Path</b> <b>Comparisons</b>
       <b>if(&lt;variable|string&gt;</b> <b>PATH_EQUAL</b> <b>&lt;variable|string&gt;)</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Compares  the  two paths component-by-component.  Only if every component of both paths match will
              the two paths compare equal.  Multiple path separators are effectively  collapsed  into  a  single
              separator,  but  note  that  backslashes  are  not  converted  to  forward slashes.  No other <u>path</u>
              <u>normalization</u> is performed.

              Component-wise comparison is superior to string-based comparison due to the handling  of  multiple
              path separators.  In the following example, the expression evaluates to true using <b>PATH_EQUAL</b>, but
              false with <b>STREQUAL</b>:

                 # comparison is TRUE
                 if ("/a//b/c" PATH_EQUAL "/a/b/c")
                    ...
                 endif()

                 # comparison is FALSE
                 if ("/a//b/c" STREQUAL "/a/b/c")
                    ...
                 endif()

              See <u>cmake_path(COMPARE)</u> for more details.

   <b>Variable</b> <b>Expansion</b>
       The  if  command was written very early in CMake's history, predating the <b>${}</b> variable evaluation syntax,
       and for convenience evaluates variables named by its arguments as shown in the  above  signatures.   Note
       that  normal  variable  evaluation  with  <b>${}</b>  applies before the if command even receives the arguments.
       Therefore code like

          set(var1 OFF)
          set(var2 "var1")
          if(${var2})

       appears to the if command as

          if(var1)

       and is evaluated according to the <b>if(&lt;variable&gt;)</b> case documented above.   The  result  is  <b>OFF</b>  which  is
       false.  However, if we remove the <b>${}</b> from the example then the command sees

          if(var2)

       which is true because <b>var2</b> is defined to <b>var1</b> which is not a false constant.

       Automatic  evaluation  applies  in the other cases whenever the above-documented condition syntax accepts
       <b>&lt;variable|string&gt;</b>:

       • The left hand argument to <u>MATCHES</u> is first checked to see if it is a  defined  variable.   If  so,  the
         variable's value is used, otherwise the original value is used.

       • If the left hand argument to <u>MATCHES</u> is missing it returns false without error

       • Both  left  and  right  hand  arguments  to  <u>LESS</u>,  <u>GREATER</u>,  <u>EQUAL</u>, <u>LESS_EQUAL</u>, and <u>GREATER_EQUAL</u>, are
         independently tested to see if they are defined variables.   If  so,  their  defined  values  are  used
         otherwise the original value is used.

       • Both   left   and   right   hand   arguments  to  <u>STRLESS</u>,  <u>STRGREATER</u>,  <u>STREQUAL</u>,  <u>STRLESS_EQUAL</u>,  and
         <u>STRGREATER_EQUAL</u> are independently tested to see if they are defined variables.  If so,  their  defined
         values are used otherwise the original value is used.

       • Both left and right hand arguments to <u>VERSION_LESS</u>, <u>VERSION_GREATER</u>, <u>VERSION_EQUAL</u>, <u>VERSION_LESS_EQUAL</u>,
         and  <u>VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL</u> are independently tested to see if they are defined variables.  If so, their
         defined values are used otherwise the original value is used.

       • The left hand argument to <u>IN_LIST</u> is tested to see if it is a defined variable.  If so, the  variable's
         value is used, otherwise the original value is used.

       • The right hand argument to <u>NOT</u> is tested to see if it is a boolean constant.  If so, the value is used,
         otherwise it is assumed to be a variable and it is dereferenced.

       • The  left  and  right  hand arguments to <u>AND</u> and <u>OR</u> are independently tested to see if they are boolean
         constants.  If so, they are used  as  such,  otherwise  they  are  assumed  to  be  variables  and  are
         dereferenced.

       Changed  in  version 3.1: To prevent ambiguity, potential variable or keyword names can be specified in a
       <u>Quoted</u> <u>Argument</u> or a <u>Bracket</u> <u>Argument</u>.  A quoted or bracketed variable or keyword will be interpreted  as
       a string and not dereferenced or interpreted.  See policy <u>CMP0054</u>.

       There  is  no  automatic  evaluation  for environment or cache <u>Variable</u> <u>References</u>.  Their values must be
       referenced as <b>$ENV{&lt;name&gt;}</b> or <b>$CACHE{&lt;name&gt;}</b>  wherever  the  above-documented  condition  syntax  accepts
       <b>&lt;variable|string&gt;</b>.

   <b>include</b>
       Load and run CMake code from a file or module.

          include(&lt;file|module&gt; [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE &lt;var&gt;]
                                [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

       Loads  and runs CMake code from the file given.  Variable reads and writes access the scope of the caller
       (dynamic scoping).  If <b>OPTIONAL</b> is present, then no error is raised if  the  file  does  not  exist.   If
       <b>RESULT_VARIABLE</b>  is  given the variable <b>&lt;var&gt;</b> will be set to the full filename which has been included or
       <b>NOTFOUND</b> if it failed.

       If a module is specified instead of a file, the file with name <b>&lt;modulename&gt;.cmake</b> is  searched  first  in
       <u>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</u>, then in the CMake module directory.  There is one exception to this: if the file which
       calls  <b>include()</b>  is  located  itself in the CMake builtin module directory, then first the CMake builtin
       module directory is searched and <u>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</u> afterwards.  See also policy <u>CMP0017</u>.

       See the <u>cmake_policy()</u> command documentation for discussion of the <b>NO_POLICY_SCOPE</b> option.

   <b>include_guard</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       Provides an include guard for the file currently being processed by CMake.

          include_guard([DIRECTORY|GLOBAL])

       Sets up  an  include  guard  for  the  current  CMake  file  (see  the  <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE</u>  variable
       documentation).

       CMake  will  end  its  processing of the current file at the location of the <b>include_guard</b> command if the
       current file has already been processed for the applicable scope (see below). This provides functionality
       similar to the include guards commonly used in source headers or to the <b>#pragma</b> <b>once</b>  directive.  If  the
       current file has been processed previously for the applicable scope, the effect is as though <u>return()</u> had
       been called. Do not call this command from inside a function being defined within the current file.

       An  optional  argument specifying the scope of the guard may be provided.  Possible values for the option
       are:

       <b>DIRECTORY</b>
              The include guard applies within the current directory and below. The file will only  be  included
              once  within  this  directory  scope,  but  may  be  included again by other files outside of this
              directory (i.e. a parent directory or another directory not pulled  in  by  <u>add_subdirectory()</u>  or
              <u>include()</u> from the current file or its children).

       <b>GLOBAL</b> The include guard applies globally to the whole build. The current file will only be included once
              regardless of the scope.

       If  no  arguments  given,  <b>include_guard</b> has the same scope as a variable, meaning that the include guard
       effect is isolated by the most recent function scope or current directory if  no  inner  function  scopes
       exist.  In this case the command behavior is the same as:

          if(__CURRENT_FILE_VAR__)
            return()
          endif()
          set(__CURRENT_FILE_VAR__ TRUE)

   <b>Introduction</b>
       The  list  subcommands  <u>APPEND</u>,  <u>INSERT</u>,  <u>FILTER</u>,  <u>PREPEND</u>,  <u>POP_BACK</u>, <u>POP_FRONT</u>, <u>REMOVE_AT</u>, <u>REMOVE_ITEM</u>,
       <u>REMOVE_DUPLICATES</u>, <u>REVERSE</u> and <u>SORT</u> may create new values for the list within the current CMake  variable
       scope.   Similar to the <u>set()</u> command, the <b>list</b> command creates new variable values in the current scope,
       even if the list itself is actually defined in a  parent  scope.   To  propagate  the  results  of  these
       operations  upwards, use <u>set()</u> with <b>PARENT_SCOPE</b>, <u>set()</u> with <b>CACHE</b> <b>INTERNAL</b>, or some other means of value
       propagation.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          A list in cmake is a <b>;</b> separated group of strings.  To create a list, the <u>set()</u> command can  be  used.
          For  example,  <b>set(var</b>  <b>a</b>  <b>b</b>  <b>c</b> <b>d</b> <b>e)</b> creates a list with <b>a;b;c;d;e</b>, and <b>set(var</b> <b>"a</b> <b>b</b> <b>c</b> <b>d</b> <b>e")</b> creates a
          string or a list with one item in it.  (Note that macro arguments are  not  variables,  and  therefore
          cannot be used in <b>LIST</b> commands.)

          Individual  elements  may  not  contain  an unequal number of <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> characters, and may not end in a
          backslash (<b>\</b>).  See <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>lists</u> for details.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          When specifying index values, if <b>&lt;element</b> <b>index&gt;</b> is 0 or greater, it is indexed from the beginning  of
          the  list,  with  0  representing  the  first list element.  If <b>&lt;element</b> <b>index&gt;</b> is -1 or lesser, it is
          indexed from the end of the list, with -1  representing  the  last  list  element.   Be  careful  when
          counting  with  negative  indices:  they  do  not start from 0.  -0 is equivalent to 0, the first list
          element.

   <b>Reading</b>
       <b>list(LENGTH</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output</b> <b>variable&gt;)</b>
              Returns the list's length.

       <b>list(GET</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>&lt;element</b> <b>index&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;element</b> <b>index&gt;</b> <b>...]</b> <b>&lt;output</b> <b>variable&gt;)</b>
              Returns the list of elements specified by indices from the list.

       <b>list(JOIN</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>&lt;glue&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output</b> <b>variable&gt;)</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              Returns a string joining all list's elements using the glue string.   To  join  multiple  strings,
              which are not part of a list, use <u>string(JOIN)</u>.

       <b>list(SUBLIST</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>&lt;begin&gt;</b> <b>&lt;length&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output</b> <b>variable&gt;)</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              Returns  a  sublist  of  the  given  list.   If <b>&lt;length&gt;</b> is 0, an empty list will be returned.  If
              <b>&lt;length&gt;</b> is -1 or the list is smaller than <b>&lt;begin&gt;+&lt;length&gt;</b> then the  remaining  elements  of  the
              list starting at <b>&lt;begin&gt;</b> will be returned.

   <b>Search</b>
       <b>list(FIND</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output</b> <b>variable&gt;)</b>
              Returns the index of the element specified in the list or <b>-1</b> if it wasn't found.

   <b>Modification</b>
       <b>list(APPEND</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;element&gt;</b> <b>...])</b>
              Appends elements to the list. If no variable named <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> exists in the current scope its value is
              treated as empty and the elements are appended to that empty list.

       <b>list(FILTER</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>&lt;INCLUDE|EXCLUDE&gt;</b> <b>REGEX</b> <b>&lt;regular_expression&gt;)</b>

       Added in version 3.6.

       Includes  or  removes  items  from  the list that match the mode's pattern.  In <b>REGEX</b> mode, items will be
       matched against the given regular expression.

       For more information on regular expressions look under <u>string(REGEX)</u>.

       <b>list(INSERT</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>&lt;element_index&gt;</b> <b>&lt;element&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;element&gt;</b> <b>...])</b>
              Inserts elements to the list to the specified index. It is an error  to  specify  an  out-of-range
              index.  Valid  indexes  are 0 to <u>N</u> where <u>N</u> is the length of the list, inclusive. An empty list has
              length 0. If no variable named <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> exists in the current scope its value is  treated  as  empty
              and the elements are inserted in that empty list.

       <b>list(POP_BACK</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;out-var&gt;...])</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              If  no  variable  name  is  given,  removes  exactly one element. Otherwise, with <u>N</u> variable names
              provided, assign the last <u>N</u> elements' values to the given variables and then  remove  the  last  <u>N</u>
              values from <b>&lt;list&gt;</b>.

       <b>list(POP_FRONT</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;out-var&gt;...])</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              If  no  variable  name  is  given,  removes  exactly one element. Otherwise, with <u>N</u> variable names
              provided, assign the first <u>N</u> elements' values to the given variables and then remove the  first  <u>N</u>
              values from <b>&lt;list&gt;</b>.

       <b>list(PREPEND</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;element&gt;</b> <b>...])</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              Insert elements to the 0th position in the list. If no variable named <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> exists in the current
              scope its value is treated as empty and the elements are prepended to that empty list.

       <b>list(REMOVE_ITEM</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;value&gt;</b> <b>...])</b>
              Removes all instances of the given items from the list.

       <b>list(REMOVE_AT</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>&lt;index&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;index&gt;</b> <b>...])</b>
              Removes items at given indices from the list.

       <b>list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;)</b>
              Removes  duplicated items in the list. The relative order of items is preserved, but if duplicates
              are encountered, only the first instance is preserved.

       <b>list(TRANSFORM</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>&lt;ACTION&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;SELECTOR&gt;]</b> <b>[OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> <b>&lt;output</b> <b>variable&gt;])</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              Transforms the list by applying an <b>&lt;ACTION&gt;</b> to all or, by specifying a <b>&lt;SELECTOR&gt;</b>, to the selected
              elements of the list, storing the result in-place or in the specified output variable.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 The <b>TRANSFORM</b> sub-command does not change the number of elements in the list. If  a  <b>&lt;SELECTOR&gt;</b>
                 is specified, only some elements will be changed, the other ones will remain the same as before
                 the transformation.

              <b>&lt;ACTION&gt;</b>  specifies the action to apply to the elements of the list.  The actions have exactly the
              same semantics as sub-commands of the <u>string()</u> command.  <b>&lt;ACTION&gt;</b> must be one of the following:

                 <u>APPEND</u><b>,</b> <u>PREPEND</u>
                        Append, prepend specified value to each element of the list.

                        <b>list(TRANSFORM</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>(APPEND|PREPEND)</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> <b>...)</b>

                 <u>TOLOWER</u><b>,</b> <u>TOUPPER</u>
                        Convert each element of the list to lower, upper characters.

                        <b>list(TRANSFORM</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>(TOLOWER|TOUPPER)</b> <b>...)</b>

                 <u>STRIP</u>  Remove leading and trailing spaces from each element of the list.

                        <b>list(TRANSFORM</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>STRIP</b> <b>...)</b>

                 <u>GENEX_STRIP</u>
                        Strip any <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> from each element of the list.

                        <b>list(TRANSFORM</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>GENEX_STRIP</b> <b>...)</b>

                 <u>REPLACE</u><b>:</b>
                        Match the regular expression as many times as possible and  substitute  the  replacement
                        expression  for  the  match  for each element of the list (same semantic as <u>string(REGEX</u>
                        <u>REPLACE)</u>).

                        <b>list(TRANSFORM</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>REPLACE</b> <b>&lt;regular_expression&gt;</b> <b>&lt;replace_expression&gt;</b> <b>...)</b>

              <b>&lt;SELECTOR&gt;</b> determines which elements of the list will be transformed.  Only one type  of  selector
              can be specified at a time.  When given, <b>&lt;SELECTOR&gt;</b> must be one of the following:

                 <b>AT</b>     Specify a list of indexes.

                            list(TRANSFORM &lt;list&gt; &lt;ACTION&gt; AT &lt;index&gt; [&lt;index&gt; ...] ...)

                 <b>FOR</b>    Specify a range with, optionally, an increment used to iterate over the range.

                            list(TRANSFORM &lt;list&gt; &lt;ACTION&gt; FOR &lt;start&gt; &lt;stop&gt; [&lt;step&gt;] ...)

                 <b>REGEX</b>  Specify  a  regular  expression.   Only elements matching the regular expression will be
                        transformed.

                            list(TRANSFORM &lt;list&gt; &lt;ACTION&gt; REGEX &lt;regular_expression&gt; ...)

   <b>Ordering</b>
       <b>list(REVERSE</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;)</b>
              Reverses the contents of the list in-place.

       <b>list(SORT</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b> <b>[COMPARE</b> <b>&lt;compare&gt;]</b> <b>[CASE</b> <b>&lt;case&gt;]</b> <b>[ORDER</b> <b>&lt;order&gt;])</b>
              Sorts the list in-place alphabetically.

              Added in version 3.13: Added the <b>COMPARE</b>, <b>CASE</b>, and <b>ORDER</b> options.

              Added in version 3.18: Added the <b>COMPARE</b> <b>NATURAL</b> option.

              Use the <b>COMPARE</b> keyword to select the comparison method for sorting.  The <b>&lt;compare&gt;</b> option  should
              be one of:

                 <b>STRING</b> Sorts  a  list  of  strings alphabetically.  This is the default behavior if the <b>COMPARE</b>
                        option is not given.

                 <b>FILE_BASENAME</b>
                        Sorts a list of pathnames of files by their basenames.

                 <b>NATURAL</b>
                        Sorts a list of strings using natural order (see <b><a href="../man3/strverscmp.3.html">strverscmp</a>(3)</b> manual), i.e.  such  that
                        contiguous  digits  are compared as whole numbers.  For example: the following list <u>10.0</u>
                        <u>1.1</u> <u>2.1</u> <u>8.0</u> <u>2.0</u> <u>3.1</u> will be sorted as <u>1.1</u> <u>2.0</u> <u>2.1</u> <u>3.1</u> <u>8.0</u> <u>10.0</u> if the <b>NATURAL</b> comparison
                        is selected where it will be sorted as  <u>1.1</u>  <u>10.0</u>  <u>2.0</u>  <u>2.1</u>  <u>3.1</u>  <u>8.0</u>  with  the  <b>STRING</b>
                        comparison.

              Use  the <b>CASE</b> keyword to select a case sensitive or case insensitive sort mode.  The <b>&lt;case&gt;</b> option
              should be one of:

                 <b>SENSITIVE</b>
                        List items are sorted in a case-sensitive manner.  This is the default behavior  if  the
                        <b>CASE</b> option is not given.

                 <b>INSENSITIVE</b>
                        List  items  are  sorted  case  insensitively.   The order of items which differ only by
                        upper/lowercase is not specified.

              To control the sort order, the <b>ORDER</b> keyword can be given.  The <b>&lt;order&gt;</b> option should be one of:

                 <b>ASCENDING</b>
                        Sorts the list in ascending order.  This is the default behavior when the  <b>ORDER</b>  option
                        is not given.

                 <b>DESCENDING</b>
                        Sorts the list in descending order.

   <b>macro</b>
       Start recording a macro for later invocation as a command

          macro(&lt;name&gt; [&lt;arg1&gt; ...])
            &lt;commands&gt;
          endmacro()

       Defines  a  macro  named  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>  that takes arguments named <b>&lt;arg1&gt;</b>, ... Commands listed after macro, but
       before the matching <u>endmacro()</u>, are not executed until the macro is invoked.

       Per legacy, the <u>endmacro()</u> command admits an optional <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> argument. If used, it  must  be  a  verbatim
       repeat of the argument of the opening <b>macro</b> command.

       See the <u>cmake_policy()</u> command documentation for the behavior of policies inside macros.

       See the <u>Macro</u> <u>vs</u> <u>Function</u> section below for differences between CMake macros and <u>functions</u>.

   <b>Invocation</b>
       The macro invocation is case-insensitive. A macro defined as

          macro(foo)
            &lt;commands&gt;
          endmacro()

       can be invoked through any of

          foo()
          Foo()
          FOO()
          cmake_language(CALL foo)

       and  so  on.  However,  it  is strongly recommended to stay with the case chosen in the macro definition.
       Typically macros use all-lowercase names.

       Added in version 3.18: The <u>cmake_language(CALL</u> <u>...)</u> command can also be used to invoke the macro.

   <b>Arguments</b>
       When a macro is invoked, the commands recorded in the  macro  are  first  modified  by  replacing  formal
       parameters (<b>${arg1}</b>, ...)  with the arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands.

       In  addition  to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the values <b>${ARGC}</b> which will be set
       to the number of arguments passed into the macro as well as <b>${ARGV0}</b>, <b>${ARGV1}</b>, <b>${ARGV2}</b>, ...  which will
       have the actual values of the arguments passed  in.   This  facilitates  creating  macros  with  optional
       arguments.

       Furthermore,  <b>${ARGV}</b>  holds  the  list of all arguments given to the macro and <b>${ARGN}</b> holds the list of
       arguments past the last expected  argument.   Referencing  to  <b>${ARGV#}</b>  arguments  beyond  <b>${ARGC}</b>  have
       undefined  behavior.  Checking that <b>${ARGC}</b> is greater than <b>#</b> is the only way to ensure that <b>${ARGV#}</b> was
       passed to the function as an extra argument.

   <b>Macro</b> <b>vs</b> <b>Function</b>
       The <b>macro</b> command is very similar to the <u>function()</u> command.  Nonetheless,  there  are  a  few  important
       differences.

       In a function, <b>ARGN</b>, <b>ARGC</b>, <b>ARGV</b> and <b>ARGV0</b>, <b>ARGV1</b>, ...  are true variables in the usual CMake sense.  In a
       macro,  they  are  not,  they are string replacements much like the C preprocessor would do with a macro.
       This has a number of consequences, as explained in the <u>Argument</u> <u>Caveats</u> section below.

       Another difference between macros and  functions  is  the  control  flow.   A  function  is  executed  by
       transferring  control  from  the  calling  statement to the function body.  A macro is executed as if the
       macro body were pasted in place of the calling statement.  This has the consequence that a <u>return()</u> in  a
       macro  body does not just terminate execution of the macro; rather, control is returned from the scope of
       the macro call.  To avoid confusion, it is recommended to avoid <u>return()</u> in macros altogether.

       Unlike      a      function,      the      <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION</u>,       <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR</u>,
       <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_FILE</u>, <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_LINE</u> variables are not set for a macro.

   <b>Argument</b> <b>Caveats</b>
       Since <b>ARGN</b>, <b>ARGC</b>, <b>ARGV</b>, <b>ARGV0</b> etc. are not variables, you will NOT be able to use commands like

          if(ARGV1) # ARGV1 is not a variable
          if(DEFINED ARGV2) # ARGV2 is not a variable
          if(ARGC GREATER 2) # ARGC is not a variable
          foreach(loop_var IN LISTS ARGN) # ARGN is not a variable

       In the first case, you can use <b>if(${ARGV1})</b>.  In the second and third case, the proper way to check if an
       optional variable was passed to the macro is to use <b>if(${ARGC}</b> <b>GREATER</b> <b>2)</b>.  In the last case, you can use
       <b>foreach(loop_var</b> <b>${ARGN})</b> but this will skip empty arguments.  If you need to include them, you can use

          set(list_var "${ARGN}")
          foreach(loop_var IN LISTS list_var)

       Note  that  if  you have a variable with the same name in the scope from which the macro is called, using
       unreferenced names will use the existing variable instead of the arguments. For example:

          macro(bar)
            foreach(arg IN LISTS ARGN)
              &lt;commands&gt;
            endforeach()
          endmacro()

          function(foo)
            bar(x y z)
          endfunction()

          foo(a b c)

       Will loop over <b>a;b;c</b> and not over <b>x;y;z</b> as one might have expected.  If you  want  true  CMake  variables
       and/or better CMake scope control you should look at the function command.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • <u>cmake_parse_arguments()</u>

       • <u>endmacro()</u>

   <b>mark_as_advanced</b>
       Mark cmake cached variables as advanced.

          mark_as_advanced([CLEAR|FORCE] &lt;var1&gt; ...)

       Sets the advanced/non-advanced state of the named cached variables.

       An  advanced  variable  will not be displayed in any of the cmake GUIs unless the <b>show</b> <b>advanced</b> option is
       on.  In script mode, the advanced/non-advanced state has no effect.

       If the keyword <b>CLEAR</b> is given then advanced variables are changed back to  unadvanced.   If  the  keyword
       <b>FORCE</b> is given then the variables are made advanced.  If neither <b>FORCE</b> nor <b>CLEAR</b> is specified, new values
       will  be marked as advanced, but if a variable already has an advanced/non-advanced state, it will not be
       changed.

       Changed in version 3.17: Variables passed to this command which are not already in the cache are ignored.
       See policy <u>CMP0102</u>.

   <b>math</b>
       Evaluate a mathematical expression.

          math(EXPR &lt;variable&gt; "&lt;expression&gt;" [OUTPUT_FORMAT &lt;format&gt;])

       Evaluates a mathematical <b>&lt;expression&gt;</b> and sets <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> to the resulting  value.   The  result  of  the
       expression must be representable as a 64-bit signed integer. Floating point inputs are invalid e.g. <b>1.1</b> <b>*</b>
       <b>10</b>.  Non-integer results e.g. <b>3</b> <b>/</b> <b>2</b> are truncated.

       The  mathematical  expression  must  be  given  as a string (i.e. enclosed in double quotation marks). An
       example is <b>"5</b> <b>*</b> <b>(10</b> <b>+</b> <b>13)"</b>.  Supported operators are <b>+</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>*</b>, <b>/</b>, <b>%</b>, <b>|</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>^</b>, <b>~</b>, <b>&lt;&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;&gt;</b>, and  <b>(...)</b>;  they
       have the same meaning as in C code.

       Added in version 3.13: Hexadecimal numbers are recognized when prefixed with <b>0x</b>, as in C code.

       Added  in  version 3.13: The result is formatted according to the option <b>OUTPUT_FORMAT</b>, where <b>&lt;format&gt;</b> is
       one of

       <b>HEXADECIMAL</b>
              Hexadecimal notation as in C code, i. e. starting with "0x".

       <b>DECIMAL</b>
              Decimal notation. Which is also used if no <b>OUTPUT_FORMAT</b> option is specified.

       For example

          math(EXPR value "100 * 0xA" OUTPUT_FORMAT DECIMAL)      # value is set to "1000"
          math(EXPR value "100 * 0xA" OUTPUT_FORMAT HEXADECIMAL)  # value is set to "0x3e8"

   <b>message</b>
       Log a message.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
          <u>General</u> <u>messages</u>
            message([&lt;mode&gt;] "message text" ...)

          <u>Reporting</u> <u>checks</u>
            message(&lt;checkState&gt; "message text" ...)

          <u>Configure</u> <u>Log</u>
            message(CONFIGURE_LOG &lt;text&gt;...)

   <b>General</b> <b>messages</b>
          message([&lt;mode&gt;] "message text" ...)

       Record the specified message text in the log.  If more  than  one  message  string  is  given,  they  are
       concatenated into a single message with no separator between the strings.

       The  optional  <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>  keyword  determines  the  type of message, which influences the way the message is
       handled:

       <b>FATAL_ERROR</b>
              CMake Error, stop processing and generation.

              The <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u> executable will return a non-zero <u>exit</u> <u>code</u>.

       <b>SEND_ERROR</b>
              CMake Error, continue processing, but skip generation.

       <b>WARNING</b>
              CMake Warning, continue processing.

       <b>AUTHOR_WARNING</b>
              CMake Warning (dev), continue processing.

       <b>DEPRECATION</b>
              CMake Deprecation Error or Warning if variable <u>CMAKE_ERROR_DEPRECATED</u> or <u>CMAKE_WARN_DEPRECATED</u>  is
              enabled, respectively, else no message.

       <b>(none)</b> <b>or</b> <b>NOTICE</b>
              Important message printed to stderr to attract user's attention.

       <b>STATUS</b> The  main interesting messages that project users might be interested in.  Ideally these should be
              concise, no more than a single line, but still informative.

       <b>VERBOSE</b>
              Detailed informational messages  intended  for  project  users.   These  messages  should  provide
              additional  details  that  won't  be  of  interest in most cases, but which may be useful to those
              building the project when they want deeper insight into what's happening.

       <b>DEBUG</b>  Detailed informational messages intended for developers working on the project itself  as  opposed
              to  users  who  just  want to build it.  These messages will not typically be of interest to other
              users building the project and will often be closely related to internal implementation details.

       <b>TRACE</b>  Fine-grained messages with very low-level implementation details.  Messages using this  log  level
              would  normally  only  be  temporary  and would expect to be removed before releasing the project,
              packaging up the files, etc.

       Added in version 3.15: Added the <b>NOTICE</b>, <b>VERBOSE</b>, <b>DEBUG</b>, and <b>TRACE</b> levels.

       The CMake command-line tool displays <b>STATUS</b> to <b>TRACE</b> messages on stdout with the message preceded by  two
       hyphens  and a space.  All other message types are sent to stderr and are not prefixed with hyphens.  The
       <u>CMake</u> <u>GUI</u> displays all messages in its log area.  The <u>curses</u> <u>interface</u> shows <b>STATUS</b> to <b>TRACE</b> messages one
       at a time on a status line and other messages in an interactive pop-up box.  The <u>--log-level</u> command-line
       option to each of these tools can be used to control which messages will be shown.

       Added in version 3.17: To make a log  level  persist  between  CMake  runs,  the  <u>CMAKE_MESSAGE_LOG_LEVEL</u>
       variable can be set instead.  Note that the command line option takes precedence over the cache variable.

       Added  in  version  3.16:  Messages  of  log  levels <b>NOTICE</b> and below will have each line preceded by the
       content of the <u>CMAKE_MESSAGE_INDENT</u> variable (converted to a single  string  by  concatenating  its  list
       items).  For <b>STATUS</b> to <b>TRACE</b> messages, this indenting content will be inserted after the hyphens.

       Added  in  version  3.17:  Messages  of log levels <b>NOTICE</b> and below can also have each line preceded with
       context of the form <b>[some.context.example]</b>.  The content between  the  square  brackets  is  obtained  by
       converting  the  <u>CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT</u> list variable to a dot-separated string.  The message context will
       always appear before any indenting content but after any automatically added leading hyphens. By default,
       message context is not shown, it  has  to  be  explicitly  enabled  by  giving  the  <u>cmake</u>  <u>--log-context</u>
       command-line   option   or   by  setting  the  <u>CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW</u>  variable  to  true.   See  the
       <u>CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT</u> documentation for usage examples.

       CMake Warning and Error message text displays using a  simple  markup  language.   Non-indented  text  is
       formatted in line-wrapped paragraphs delimited by newlines.  Indented text is considered pre-formatted.

   <b>Reporting</b> <b>checks</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       A  common  pattern  in  CMake output is a message indicating the start of some sort of check, followed by
       another message reporting the result of that check.  For example:

          message(STATUS "Looking for someheader.h")
          #... do the checks, set checkSuccess with the result
          if(checkSuccess)
            message(STATUS "Looking for someheader.h - found")
          else()
            message(STATUS "Looking for someheader.h - not found")
          endif()

       This can be more robustly and conveniently expressed using the <b>CHECK_...</b>  keyword form of  the  <b>message()</b>
       command:

          message(&lt;checkState&gt; "message" ...)

       where <b>&lt;checkState&gt;</b> must be one of the following:

          <b>CHECK_START</b>
                 Record a concise message about the check about to be performed.

          <b>CHECK_PASS</b>
                 Record a successful result for a check.

          <b>CHECK_FAIL</b>
                 Record an unsuccessful result for a check.

       When  recording  a check result, the command repeats the message from the most recently started check for
       which no result has yet been reported, then some separator characters and then the message text  provided
       after the <b>CHECK_PASS</b> or <b>CHECK_FAIL</b> keyword.  Check messages are always reported at <b>STATUS</b> log level.

       Checks  may  be  nested  and every <b>CHECK_START</b> should have exactly one matching <b>CHECK_PASS</b> or <b>CHECK_FAIL</b>.
       The <u>CMAKE_MESSAGE_INDENT</u> variable can also be used to add indenting to nested  checks  if  desired.   For
       example:

          message(CHECK_START "Finding my things")
          list(APPEND CMAKE_MESSAGE_INDENT "  ")
          <a href="../manmissingComponents/unset.missingComponents.html">unset</a>(missingComponents)

          message(CHECK_START "Finding partA")
          # ... do check, assume we find A
          message(CHECK_PASS "found")

          message(CHECK_START "Finding partB")
          # ... do check, assume we don't find B
          list(APPEND missingComponents B)
          message(CHECK_FAIL "not found")

          list(POP_BACK CMAKE_MESSAGE_INDENT)
          <a href="../manmissingComponents/if.missingComponents.html">if</a>(missingComponents)
            message(CHECK_FAIL "missing components: ${missingComponents}")
          else()
            message(CHECK_PASS "all components found")
          endif()

       Output from the above would appear something like the following:

          -- Finding my things
          --   Finding partA
          --   Finding partA - found
          --   Finding partB
          --   Finding partB - not found
          -- Finding my things - missing components: B

   <b>Configure</b> <b>Log</b>
       Added in version 3.26.

          message(CONFIGURE_LOG &lt;text&gt;...)

       Record a <u>configure-log</u> <u>message</u> <u>event</u> with the specified <b>&lt;text&gt;</b>.  By convention, if the text contains more
       than one line, the first line should be a summary of the event.

       This  mode  is  intended  to  record the details of a system inspection check or other one-time operation
       guarded by a cache entry, but that is not performed using <u>try_compile()</u> or <u>try_run()</u>, which automatically
       log their details.  Projects should avoid calling it every time CMake runs.  For example:

          if (NOT DEFINED MY_CHECK_RESULT)
            # Print check summary in configure output.
            message(CHECK_START "My Check")

            # ... perform system inspection, e.g., with execute_process ...

            # Cache the result so we do not run the check again.
            set(MY_CHECK_RESULT "${MY_CHECK_RESULT}" CACHE INTERNAL "My Check")

            # Record the check details in the cmake-configure-log.
            message(CONFIGURE_LOG
              "My Check Result: ${MY_CHECK_RESULT}\n"
              "${details}"
            )

            # Print check result in configure output.
            if(MY_CHECK_RESULT)
              message(CHECK_PASS "passed")
            else()
              message(CHECK_FAIL "failed")
            endif()
          endif()

       If no project is currently being configured, such as in <u>cmake</u> <u>-P</u> script mode, this command does nothing.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • <u>cmake_language(GET_MESSAGE_LOG_LEVEL)</u>

   <b>option</b>
       Provide a boolean option that the user can optionally select.

          option(&lt;variable&gt; "&lt;help_text&gt;" [value])

       If no initial <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> is provided, boolean <b>OFF</b> is the default value.  If <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> is already set  as  a
       normal or cache variable, then the command does nothing (see policy <u>CMP0077</u>).

       For options that depend on the values of other options, see the module help for <u>CMakeDependentOption</u>.

       In CMake project mode, a boolean cache variable is created with the option value. In CMake script mode, a
       boolean variable is set with the option value.

   <b>return</b>
       Return from a file, directory or function.

          return([PROPAGATE &lt;var-name&gt;...])

       When  this  command  is  encountered  in  an  included  file (via <u>include()</u> or <u>find_package()</u>), it causes
       processing of the current file to stop and  control  is  returned  to  the  including  file.   If  it  is
       encountered  in  a  file  which  is  not  included by another file, e.g. a <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>, deferred calls
       scheduled by <u>cmake_language(DEFER)</u> are invoked and control is returned to the parent directory  if  there
       is one.

       If  <b>return()</b>  is  called  in a function, control is returned to the caller of that function.  Note that a
       <u>macro()</u>, unlike a <u>function()</u>, is expanded in place and therefore cannot handle <b>return()</b>.

       Policy <u>CMP0140</u> controls the behavior regarding the arguments of the command.  All arguments  are  ignored
       unless that policy is set to <b>NEW</b>.

       <b>PROPAGATE</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              This  option  sets  or  unsets  the specified variables in the parent directory or function caller
              scope. This is equivalent to <u>set(PARENT_SCOPE)</u> or <u>unset(PARENT_SCOPE)</u> commands, except for the way
              it interacts with the <u>block()</u> command, as described below.

              The <b>PROPAGATE</b> option can be very useful in conjunction with the <u>block()</u> command.   A  <b>return</b>  will
              propagate  the  specified  variables  through  any  enclosing  block scopes created by the <u>block()</u>
              commands.  Inside a function, this ensures the variables are propagated to the function's  caller,
              regardless  of any blocks within the function.  If not inside a function, it ensures the variables
              are propagated to the parent file or directory scope. For example:

              CMakeLists.txt

                 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.25)
                 project(example)

                 set(var1 "top-value")

                 block(SCOPE_FOR VARIABLES)
                   add_subdirectory(subDir)
                   # var1 has the value "block-nested"
                 endblock()

                 # var1 has the value "top-value"

              subDir/CMakeLists.txt

                 function(multi_scopes result_var1 result_var2)
                   block(SCOPE_FOR VARIABLES)
                     # This would only propagate out of the immediate block, not to
                     # the caller of the function.
                     #set(${result_var1} "new-value" PARENT_SCOPE)
                     #unset(${result_var2} PARENT_SCOPE)

                     # This propagates the variables through the enclosing block and
                     # out to the caller of the function.
                     set(${result_var1} "new-value")
                     unset(${result_var2})
                     return(PROPAGATE ${result_var1} ${result_var2})
                   endblock()
                 endfunction()

                 set(var1 "some-value")
                 set(var2 "another-value")

                 multi_scopes(var1 var2)
                 # Now var1 will hold "new-value" and var2 will be unset

                 block(SCOPE_FOR VARIABLES)
                   # This return() will set var1 in the directory scope that included us
                   # via add_subdirectory(). The surrounding block() here does not limit
                   # propagation to the current file, but the block() in the parent
                   # directory scope does prevent propagation going any further.
                   set(var1 "block-nested")
                   return(PROPAGATE var1)
                 endblock()

   <b>separate_arguments</b>
       Parse command-line arguments into a semicolon-separated list.

          separate_arguments(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;mode&gt; [PROGRAM [SEPARATE_ARGS]] &lt;args&gt;)

       Parses a space-separated string <b>&lt;args&gt;</b> into a list of items, and stores this list in  semicolon-separated
       standard form in <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.

       This  function is intended for parsing command-line arguments.  The entire command line must be passed as
       one string in the argument <b>&lt;args&gt;</b>.

       The exact parsing rules depend on the operating system.  They are specified by the <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b> argument  which
       must be one of the following keywords:

       <b>UNIX_COMMAND</b>
              Arguments  are  separated  by  unquoted  whitespace.  Both single-quote and double-quote pairs are
              respected.  A backslash escapes the next literal character (<b>\"</b> is <b>"</b>); there are no special escapes
              (<b>\n</b> is just <b>n</b>).

       <b>WINDOWS_COMMAND</b>
              A Windows command-line is parsed using the same syntax the runtime library uses to construct  argv
              at  startup.   It  separates  arguments  by whitespace that is not double-quoted.  Backslashes are
              literal unless they precede double-quotes.  See the MSDN article <u>Parsing</u> <u>C</u> <u>Command-Line</u>  <u>Arguments</u>
              for details.

       <b>NATIVE_COMMAND</b>
              Added in version 3.9.

              Proceeds  as  in  <b>WINDOWS_COMMAND</b>  mode  if  the host system is Windows.  Otherwise proceeds as in
              <b>UNIX_COMMAND</b> mode.

       <b>PROGRAM</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              The first item in <b>&lt;args&gt;</b> is assumed to be an executable and will be searched in the system  search
              path  or  left  as a full path. If not found, <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> will be empty. Otherwise, <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> is a
              list of 2 elements:

                 0.  Absolute path of the program

                 1.  Any command-line arguments present in <b>&lt;args&gt;</b> as a string

              For example:

                 separate_arguments (out UNIX_COMMAND PROGRAM "cc -c main.c")

              • First element of the list: <b>/path/to/cc</b>

              • Second element of the list: <b>"</b> <b>-c</b> <b>main.c"</b>

       <b>SEPARATE_ARGS</b>
              When this sub-option of <b>PROGRAM</b> option is specified, command-line arguments will be split as  well
              and stored in <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.

              For example:

                 separate_arguments (out UNIX_COMMAND PROGRAM SEPARATE_ARGS "cc -c main.c")

              The contents of <b>out</b> will be: <b>/path/to/cc;-c;main.c</b>

          separate_arguments(&lt;var&gt;)

       Convert the value of <b>&lt;var&gt;</b> to a semi-colon separated list.  All spaces are replaced with ';'.  This helps
       with generating command lines.

   <b>set</b>
       Set  a  normal,  cache,  or  environment  variable to a given value.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-language.7.html">cmake-language</a>(7)</u> <u>variables</u>
       documentation for the scopes and interaction of normal variables and cache entries.

       Signatures of this command that specify a <b>&lt;value&gt;...</b> placeholder expect zero or more arguments.  Multiple
       arguments will be joined as a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> to form the actual variable value to be set.

   <b>Set</b> <b>Normal</b> <b>Variable</b>
       <b>set(&lt;variable&gt;</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;...</b> <b>[PARENT_SCOPE])</b>
              Set or unset <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> in the current function or directory scope:

              • If at least one <b>&lt;value&gt;...</b> is given, set the variable to that value.

              • If no value is given, unset the variable.  This is equivalent to <u>unset(&lt;variable&gt;)</u>.

              If the <b>PARENT_SCOPE</b> option is given the variable will be set in the scope above the current scope.
              Each new directory or <u>function()</u> command creates a new scope.  A scope can also  be  created  with
              the <u>block()</u> command. <b>set(PARENT_SCOPE)</b> will set the value of a variable into the parent directory,
              calling  function,  or  encompassing  scope  (whichever  is  applicable to the case at hand).  The
              previous state of the variable's value stays the same in  the  current  scope  (e.g.,  if  it  was
              undefined before, it is still undefined and if it had a value, it is still that value).

              The  <u>block(PROPAGATE)</u>  and  <u>return(PROPAGATE)</u>  commands  can be used as an alternate method to the
              <u>set(PARENT_SCOPE)</u> and <u>unset(PARENT_SCOPE)</u> commands to update the parent scope.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          When evaluating <u>Variable</u> <u>References</u> of the form <b>${VAR}</b>, CMake first searches  for  a  normal  variable
          with that name.  If no such normal variable exists, CMake will then search for a cache entry with that
          name.   Because  of  this, <b>unsetting</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>variable</b> <b>can</b> <b>expose</b> <b>a</b> <b>cache</b> <b>variable</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>previously</b>
          <b>hidden</b>.  To  force  a  variable  reference  of  the  form  <b>${VAR}</b>  to  return  an  empty  string,  use
          <b>set(&lt;variable&gt;</b> <b>"")</b>, which clears the normal variable but leaves it defined.

   <b>Set</b> <b>Cache</b> <b>Entry</b>
       <b>set(&lt;variable&gt;</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;...</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> <b>&lt;docstring&gt;</b> <b>[FORCE])</b>
              Sets  the  given  cache  <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>  (cache  entry).   Since  cache  entries  are meant to provide
              user-settable values this does not overwrite existing cache entries by  default.   Use  the  <b>FORCE</b>
              option to overwrite existing entries.

              The <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> must be specified as one of:

                 <b>BOOL</b>   Boolean <b>ON/OFF</b> value.  <u><a href="../man1/cmake-gui.1.html">cmake-gui</a>(1)</u> offers a checkbox.

                 <b>FILEPATH</b>
                        Path to a file on disk.  <u><a href="../man1/cmake-gui.1.html">cmake-gui</a>(1)</u> offers a file dialog.

                 <b>PATH</b>   Path to a directory on disk.  <u><a href="../man1/cmake-gui.1.html">cmake-gui</a>(1)</u> offers a file dialog.

                 <b>STRING</b> A  line  of  text.   <u><a href="../man1/cmake-gui.1.html">cmake-gui</a>(1)</u>  offers  a  text field or a drop-down selection if the
                        <u>STRINGS</u> cache entry property is set.

                 <b>INTERNAL</b>
                        A line of text.  <u><a href="../man1/cmake-gui.1.html">cmake-gui</a>(1)</u> does not show internal entries.  They may be used to store
                        variables persistently across runs.  Use of this type implies <b>FORCE</b>.

              The <b>&lt;docstring&gt;</b> must be specified as a line of text providing a quick summary of  the  option  for
              presentation to <u><a href="../man1/cmake-gui.1.html">cmake-gui</a>(1)</u> users.

              If  the  cache  entry does not exist prior to the call or the <b>FORCE</b> option is given then the cache
              entry will be set to the given value.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 The content of the cache variable will not be directly accessible if a normal variable  of  the
                 same  name already exists (see <u>rules</u> <u>of</u> <u>variable</u> <u>evaluation</u>).  If policy <u>CMP0126</u> is set to <b>OLD</b>,
                 any normal variable binding in the current scope will be removed.

              It is possible for the cache entry to exist prior to the call but have  no  type  set  if  it  was
              created  on  the  <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u>  command  line  by  a  user  through the <u>-D&lt;var&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</u> option without
              specifying a type.  In this case the <b>set</b> command will add the type.  Furthermore, if the <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> is
              <b>PATH</b> or <b>FILEPATH</b> and the <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> provided on the command line is a relative  path,  then  the  <b>set</b>
              command  will  treat  the  path  as relative to the current working directory and convert it to an
              absolute path.

   <b>Set</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Variable</b>
       <b>set(ENV{&lt;variable&gt;}</b> <b>[&lt;value&gt;])</b>
              Sets an <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u> to the given value.  Subsequent calls of <b>$ENV{&lt;variable&gt;}</b> will return
              this new value.

              This command affects only the current CMake process, not the process from which CMake was  called,
              nor the system environment at large, nor the environment of subsequent build or test processes.

              If  no argument is given after <b>ENV{&lt;variable&gt;}</b> or if <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> is an empty string, then this command
              will clear any existing value of the environment variable.

              Arguments after <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> are ignored. If extra arguments are  found,  then  an  author  warning  is
              issued.

                       PROPERTY &lt;name&gt; [&lt;value1&gt; ...])

       Sets one property on zero or more objects of a scope.

       The first argument determines the scope in which the property is set.  It must be one of the following:

       <b>GLOBAL</b> Scope is unique and does not accept a name.

       <b>DIRECTORY</b>
              Scope defaults to the current directory but other directories (already processed by CMake) may  be
              named  by  full  or  relative  path.  Relative paths are treated as relative to the current source
              directory.  See also the <u>set_directory_properties()</u> command.

              Added in version 3.19: <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> may reference a binary directory.

       <b>TARGET</b> Scope may name zero or more existing targets.  See also the <u>set_target_properties()</u> command.

              <u>Alias</u> <u>Targets</u> do not support setting target properties.

       <b>SOURCE</b> Scope may name zero or more source files.  By default, source file properties are only visible  to
              targets added in the same directory (<b>CMakeLists.txt</b>).

              Added  in  version  3.18: Visibility can be set in other directory scopes using one or both of the
              following sub-options:

              <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;dirs&gt;...</b>
                     The source file property will be set in each of the <b>&lt;dirs&gt;</b> directories' scopes.  CMake must
                     already know about each of these directories, either by having added them through a call to
                     <u>add_subdirectory()</u> or it being the top level source directory.  Relative paths are  treated
                     as relative to the current source directory.

                     Added in version 3.19: <b>&lt;dirs&gt;</b> may reference a binary directory.

              <b>TARGET_DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;targets&gt;...</b>
                     The  source  file  property  will  be  set in each of the directory scopes where any of the
                     specified <b>&lt;targets&gt;</b> were created (the <b>&lt;targets&gt;</b> must therefore already exist).

              See also the <u>set_source_files_properties()</u> command.

       <b>INSTALL</b>
              Added in version 3.1.

              Scope may name zero or more installed file paths.  These are made available to CPack to  influence
              deployment.

              Both  the  property key and value may use generator expressions.  Specific properties may apply to
              installed files and/or directories.

              Path components have to be  separated  by  forward  slashes,  must  be  normalized  and  are  case
              sensitive.

              To reference the installation prefix itself with a relative path use <b>.</b>.

              Currently  installed  file properties are only defined for the WIX generator where the given paths
              are relative to the installation prefix.

       <b>TEST</b>   Scope is limited to the directory the command is called in. It may  name  zero  or  more  existing
              tests. See also command <u>set_tests_properties()</u>.

              Test  property  values  may  be  specified  using  <u>generator</u>  <u>expressions</u> for tests created by the
              <u>add_test(NAME)</u> signature.

              Added in version 3.28: Visibility can be  set  in  other  directory  scopes  using  the  following
              sub-option:

              <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                     The test property will be set in the <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> directory's scope. CMake must already know about
                     this  directory, either by having added it through a call to <u>add_subdirectory()</u> or it being
                     the top level source directory.  Relative paths are treated  as  relative  to  the  current
                     source directory.  <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> may reference a binary directory.

       <b>CACHE</b>  Scope must name zero or more existing cache entries.

       The  required  <b>PROPERTY</b>  option  is  immediately  followed by the name of the property to set.  Remaining
       arguments are used to compose the property value in the form of a semicolon-separated list.

       If the <b>APPEND</b> option is given the list is appended to any existing  property  value  (except  that  empty
       values are ignored and not appended).  If the <b>APPEND_STRING</b> option is given the string is appended to any
       existing  property  value  as string, i.e. it results in a longer string and not a list of strings.  When
       using  <b>APPEND</b>  or  <b>APPEND_STRING</b>  with  a  property  defined   to   support   <b>INHERITED</b>   behavior   (see
       <u>define_property()</u>), no inheriting occurs when finding the initial value to append to.  If the property is
       not  already  directly  set  in  the  nominated  scope,  the  command  will  behave  as  though <b>APPEND</b> or
       <b>APPEND_STRING</b> had not been given.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The <u>GENERATED</u> source file property may be globally visible.  See its documentation for details.

       • <u>get_property()</u>

       • The <u><a href="../man7/cmake-properties.7.html">cmake-properties</a>(7)</u> manual for a list of properties in each scope.

   <b>site_name</b>
       Set the given variable to the name of the computer.

          site_name(variable)

       On UNIX-like platforms, if the variable <b>HOSTNAME</b> is set, its value will be executed as a command expected
       to print out the host name, much like the <b>hostname</b> command-line tool.

   <b>Search</b> <b>and</b> <b>Replace</b>
   <b>Search</b> <b>and</b> <b>Replace</b> <b>With</b> <b>Plain</b> <b>Strings</b>
       <b>string(FIND</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> <b>&lt;substring&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b> <b>[REVERSE])</b>
              Return the position where the given <b>&lt;substring&gt;</b> was  found  in  the  supplied  <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>.   If  the
              <b>REVERSE</b>  flag  was  used,  the  command will search for the position of the last occurrence of the
              specified <b>&lt;substring&gt;</b>.  If the <b>&lt;substring&gt;</b> is not found, a position of -1 is returned.

              The <b>string(FIND)</b> subcommand treats all strings as ASCII-only  characters.   The  index  stored  in
              <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b>  will  also be counted in bytes, so strings containing multi-byte characters may
              lead to unexpected results.

       <b>string(REPLACE</b> <b>&lt;match_string&gt;</b> <b>&lt;replace_string&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b> <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;input&gt;...])</b>

       <b>string(REGEX</b> <b>MATCH</b> <b>&lt;regular_expression&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b> <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;input&gt;...])</b>
              Match  the  <b>&lt;regular_expression&gt;</b>  once  and store the match in the <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b>.  All <b>&lt;input&gt;</b>
              arguments are concatenated before matching.  Regular expressions are specified in  the  subsection
              just below.

       <b>string(REGEX</b> <b>MATCHALL</b> <b>&lt;regular_expression&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b> <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;input&gt;...])</b>
              Match  the  <b>&lt;regular_expression&gt;</b>  as  many  times  as  possible  and  store  the  matches  in  the
              <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b> as a list.  All <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> arguments are concatenated before matching.

       <b>string(REGEX</b> <b>REPLACE</b> <b>&lt;regular_expression&gt;</b> <b>&lt;replacement_expression&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b> <b>&lt;input&gt;</b>
       <b>[&lt;input&gt;...])</b>
              Match   the   <b>&lt;regular_expression&gt;</b>   as   many   times   as   possible    and    substitute    the
              <b>&lt;replacement_expression&gt;</b>  for  the  match  in  the output.  All <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> arguments are concatenated
              before matching.

              The <b>&lt;replacement_expression&gt;</b> may refer to parenthesis-delimited subexpressions of the match  using
              <b>\1</b>,  <b>\2</b>,  ...,  <b>\9</b>.  Note that two backslashes (<b>\\1</b>) are required in CMake code to get a backslash
              through argument parsing.

   <b>Regex</b> <b>Specification</b>
       The following characters have special meaning in regular expressions:

       <b>^</b>      Matches at beginning of input

       <b>$</b>      Matches at end of input

       <b>.</b>      Matches any single character

       <b>\&lt;char&gt;</b>
              Matches the single character specified by <b>&lt;char&gt;</b>.  Use this to  match  special  regex  characters,
              e.g.  <b>\.</b>  for  a  literal <b>.</b>  or <b>\\</b> for a literal backslash <b>\</b>.  Escaping a non-special character is
              unnecessary but allowed, e.g. <b>\a</b> matches <b>a</b>.

       <b>[</b> <b>]</b>    Matches any character(s) inside the brackets.  To match a literal <b>]</b>, make it the first  character,
              e.g., <b>[]ab]</b>.

       <b>[^</b> <b>]</b>   Matches  any  character(s)  not  inside the brackets.  To not match a literal <b>]</b>, make it the first
              character, e.g., <b>[^]ab]</b>.

       <b>-</b>      Inside brackets, specifies an inclusive range between characters on either side,  e.g.,  <b>[a-f]</b>  is
              <b>[abcdef]</b>.   To  match  a  literal <b>-</b> using brackets, make it the first or the last character, e.g.,
              <b>[+*/-]</b> matches basic mathematical operators.

       <b>*</b>      Matches preceding pattern zero or more times

       <b>+</b>      Matches preceding pattern one or more times

       <b>?</b>      Matches preceding pattern zero or once only

       <b>|</b>      Matches a pattern on either side of the <b>|</b>

       <b>()</b>     Saves a matched subexpression, which can be referenced in the <b>REGEX</b> <b>REPLACE</b> operation.

              Added in version 3.9: All regular expression-related commands, including e.g.   <u>if(MATCHES)</u>,  save
              subgroup matches in the variables <u>CMAKE_MATCH_&lt;n&gt;</u> for <b>&lt;n&gt;</b> 0..9.

       <b>*</b>,  <b>+</b>  and <b>?</b> have higher precedence than concatenation.  <b>|</b> has lower precedence than concatenation.  This
       means that the regular expression <b>^ab+d$</b> matches <b>abbd</b> but not <b>ababd</b>, and the regular expression <b>^(ab|cd)$</b>
       matches <b>ab</b> but not <b>abd</b>.

       CMake language <u>Escape</u> <u>Sequences</u> such as <b>\t</b>, <b>\r</b>, <b>\n</b>, and  <b>\\</b>  may  be  used  to  construct  literal  tabs,
       carriage returns, newlines, and backslashes (respectively) to pass in a regex.  For example:

       • The quoted argument <b>"[</b> <b>\t\r\n]"</b> specifies a regex that matches any single whitespace character.

       • The quoted argument <b>"[/\\]"</b> specifies a regex that matches a single forward slash <b>/</b> or backslash <b>\</b>.

       • The  quoted argument <b>"[A-Za-z0-9_]"</b> specifies a regex that matches any single "word" character in the C
         locale.

       • The quoted argument <b>"\\(\\a\\+b\\)"</b> specifies a regex that matches the exact string <b>(a+b)</b>.  Each <b>\\</b>  is
         parsed  in  a  quoted  argument  as  just  <b>\</b>,  so  the  regex  itself is actually <b>\(\a\+\b\)</b>.  This can
         alternatively be specified in a <u>Bracket</u>  <u>Argument</u>  without  having  to  escape  the  backslashes,  e.g.
         <b>[[\(\a\+\b\)]]</b>.

   <b>Manipulation</b>
       <b>string(APPEND</b> <b>&lt;string_variable&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;input&gt;...])</b>
              Added in version 3.4.

              Append all the <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> arguments to the string.

       <b>string(PREPEND</b> <b>&lt;string_variable&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;input&gt;...])</b>
              Added in version 3.10.

              Prepend all the <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> arguments to the string.

       <b>string(CONCAT</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;input&gt;...])</b>
              Concatenate   all   the   <b>&lt;input&gt;</b>   arguments   together   and  store  the  result  in  the  named
              <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b>.

       <b>string(JOIN</b> <b>&lt;glue&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;input&gt;...])</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              Join all the <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> arguments together using the <b>&lt;glue&gt;</b> string and store the result in the  named
              <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b>.

              To  join  a list's elements, prefer to use the <b>JOIN</b> operator from the <u>list()</u> command.  This allows
              for the elements to have special characters like <b>;</b> in them.

       <b>string(TOLOWER</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;)</b>
              Convert <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> to lower characters.

       <b>string(TOUPPER</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;)</b>
              Convert <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> to upper characters.

       <b>string(LENGTH</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;)</b>
              Store in an <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b> a given string's length in bytes.  Note that this means if  <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              contains  multi-byte  characters, the result stored in <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b> will <u>not</u> be the number of
              characters.

       <b>string(SUBSTRING</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> <b>&lt;begin&gt;</b> <b>&lt;length&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;)</b>
              Store in an <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b> a substring of a given <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>.  If <b>&lt;length&gt;</b> is <b>-1</b> the remainder of
              the string starting at <b>&lt;begin&gt;</b> will be returned.

              Changed in version 3.2: If <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> is shorter than <b>&lt;length&gt;</b> then the end of the  string  is  used
              instead.  Previous versions of CMake reported an error in this case.

              Both  <b>&lt;begin&gt;</b>  and  <b>&lt;length&gt;</b>  are  counted  in  bytes, so care must be exercised if <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> could
              contain multi-byte characters.

       <b>string(STRIP</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;)</b>
              Store in an <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b> a substring of a given <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> with  leading  and  trailing  spaces
              removed.

       <b>string(GENEX_STRIP</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;)</b>
              Added in version 3.1.

              Strip   any   <u>generator</u>  <u>expressions</u>  from  the  input  <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>  and  store  the  result  in  the
              <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b>.

       <b>string(REPEAT</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> <b>&lt;count&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;)</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              Produce the output string as the input <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> repeated <b>&lt;count&gt;</b> times.

   <b>Comparison</b>
       <b>string(COMPARE</b> <b>LESS</b> <b>&lt;string1&gt;</b> <b>&lt;string2&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;)</b>

       <b>string(COMPARE</b> <b>GREATER</b> <b>&lt;string1&gt;</b> <b>&lt;string2&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;)</b>

       <b>string(COMPARE</b> <b>EQUAL</b> <b>&lt;string1&gt;</b> <b>&lt;string2&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;)</b>

       <b>string(COMPARE</b> <b>NOTEQUAL</b> <b>&lt;string1&gt;</b> <b>&lt;string2&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;)</b>

       <b>string(COMPARE</b> <b>LESS_EQUAL</b> <b>&lt;string1&gt;</b> <b>&lt;string2&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;)</b>

       <b>string(COMPARE</b> <b>GREATER_EQUAL</b> <b>&lt;string1&gt;</b> <b>&lt;string2&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;)</b>
              Compare the strings and store true or false in the <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b>.

              Added in version 3.7: Added the <b>LESS_EQUAL</b> and <b>GREATER_EQUAL</b> options.

   <b>Hashing</b>
       <b>string(&lt;HASH&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b> <b>&lt;input&gt;)</b>
              Compute a cryptographic hash of the <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> string.  The supported <b>&lt;HASH&gt;</b> algorithm names are:

              <b>MD5</b>    Message-Digest Algorithm 5, RFC 1321.

              Convert each byte  in  the  input  <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>  to  its  hexadecimal  representation  and  store  the
              concatenated  hex  digits  in  the  <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b>.  Letters in the output (<b>a</b> through <b>f</b>) are in
              lowercase.

       <b>string(CONFIGURE</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b> <b>[@ONLY]</b> <b>[ESCAPE_QUOTES])</b>
              Transform a <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> like <u>configure_file()</u> transforms a file.

              Convert each non-alphanumeric character in the input <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>  to  an  underscore  and  store  the
              result in the <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b>.  If the first character of the <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> is a digit, an underscore
              will also be prepended to the result.

       <b>string(RANDOM</b> <b>[LENGTH</b> <b>&lt;length&gt;]</b> <b>[ALPHABET</b> <b>&lt;alphabet&gt;]</b> <b>[RANDOM_SEED</b> <b>&lt;seed&gt;]</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;)</b>
              Return  a  random  string  of  given  <b>&lt;length&gt;</b> consisting of characters from the given <b>&lt;alphabet&gt;</b>.
              Default length is 5 characters and default alphabet is  all  numbers  and  upper  and  lower  case
              letters.   If  an  integer  <b>RANDOM_SEED</b> is given, its value will be used to seed the random number
              generator.

       <b>string(TIMESTAMP</b> <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;format_string&gt;]</b> <b>[UTC])</b>
              Write a string representation of the current date and/or time to the <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b>.

              If the command is unable to obtain a timestamp, the <b>&lt;output_variable&gt;</b> will be  set  to  the  empty
              string <b>""</b>.

              The optional <b>UTC</b> flag requests the current date/time representation to be in Coordinated Universal

              <b>%Z</b>     Added in version 3.26.

                     The time zone name.

              Unknown format specifiers will be ignored and copied to the output as-is.

              If no explicit <b>&lt;format_string&gt;</b> is given, it will default to:

                 %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S    for local time.
                 %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ   for UTC.

              Added in version 3.8: If the <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b> environment variable is set, its value will be used
              instead  of  the  current  time.  See <u>https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/</u> for
              details.

              Create a universally unique identifier (aka GUID) as per RFC4122 based on the hash of the combined
              values of <b>&lt;namespace&gt;</b> (which itself has to be a valid UUID) and <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>.  The hash algorithm can be
              either  <b>MD5</b>  (Version  3  UUID)  or  <b>SHA1</b>   (Version   5   UUID).    A   UUID   has   the   format
              <b>xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx</b>  where  each <b>x</b> represents a lower case hexadecimal character.
              Where required, an uppercase representation can be requested with the optional <b>UPPER</b> flag.

   <b>JSON</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       Functionality for querying a JSON string.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          In each of the following JSON-related subcommands, if the optional <b>ERROR_VARIABLE</b> argument  is  given,
          errors    will    be   reported   in   <b>&lt;error-variable&gt;</b>   and   the   <b>&lt;out-var&gt;</b>   will   be   set   to

          occurred,  or  just  <b>NOTFOUND</b> if there is no relevant path.  If an error occurs but the <b>ERROR_VARIABLE</b>
          option is not present, a fatal error message is generated.  If no error occurs,  the  <b>&lt;error-variable&gt;</b>

              Set  an  element in <b>&lt;json-string&gt;</b> at the location given by the list of <b>&lt;member|index&gt;</b> arguments to
              <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>.  The contents of <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> should be valid JSON.  If <b>&lt;json-string&gt;</b> is an array, <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> can

              Compare  the  two  JSON  objects  given  by  <b>&lt;json-string1&gt;</b>  and <b>&lt;json-string2&gt;</b> for equality.  The
              contents of <b>&lt;json-string1&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;json-string2&gt;</b> should be valid JSON.  The <b>&lt;out-var&gt;</b> will be set  to
              a true value if the JSON objects are considered equal, or a false value otherwise.

   <b>unset</b>
       Unset a variable, cache variable, or environment variable.

   <b>Unset</b> <b>Normal</b> <b>Variable</b> <b>or</b> <b>Cache</b> <b>Entry</b>
          unset(&lt;variable&gt; [CACHE | PARENT_SCOPE])

       Removes  a  normal variable from the current scope, causing it to become undefined.  If <b>CACHE</b> is present,
       then a cache variable is removed instead of a normal variable.

       If <b>PARENT_SCOPE</b> is present then the variable is removed from the scope above the current scope.  See  the
       same option in the <u>set()</u> command for further details.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          When  evaluating  <u>Variable</u>  <u>References</u>  of the form <b>${VAR}</b>, CMake first searches for a normal variable
          with that name.  If no such normal variable exists, CMake will then search for a cache entry with that
          name.  Because of this, <b>unsetting</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>variable</b> <b>can</b> <b>expose</b> <b>a</b> <b>cache</b> <b>variable</b>  <b>that</b>  <b>was</b>  <b>previously</b>
          <b>hidden</b>.   To  force  a  variable  reference  of  the  form  <b>${VAR}</b>  to  return  an  empty  string, use
          <b>set(&lt;variable&gt;</b> <b>"")</b>, which clears the normal variable but leaves it defined.

   <b>Unset</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Variable</b>
          unset(ENV{&lt;variable&gt;})

       Removes  <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>  from  the  currently  available  <u>Environment</u>   <u>Variables</u>.    Subsequent   calls   of
       <b>$ENV{&lt;variable&gt;}</b> will return the empty string.

       This command affects only the current CMake process, not the process from which CMake was called, nor the
       system environment at large, nor the environment of subsequent build or test processes.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • <u>set()</u>

   <b>variable_watch</b>
       Watch the CMake variable for change.

          variable_watch(&lt;variable&gt; [&lt;command&gt;])

       If  the specified <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> changes and no <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> is given, a message will be printed to inform about
       the change.

       If <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> is given, this command will be executed instead.  The command  will  receive  the  following
       arguments: <b>COMMAND(&lt;variable&gt;</b> <b>&lt;access&gt;</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> <b>&lt;current_list_file&gt;</b> <b>&lt;stack&gt;)</b>

       <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>
              Name of the variable being accessed.

       <b>&lt;access&gt;</b>
              One    of   <b>READ_ACCESS</b>,   <b>UNKNOWN_READ_ACCESS</b>,   <b>MODIFIED_ACCESS</b>,   <b>UNKNOWN_MODIFIED_ACCESS</b>,   or
              <b>REMOVED_ACCESS</b>.  The <b>UNKNOWN_</b> values are only used when the variable has  never  been  set.   Once
              set, they are never used again during the same CMake run, even if the variable is later unset.

       <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              The  value  of the variable.  On a modification, this is the new (modified) value of the variable.
              On removal, the value is empty.

       <b>&lt;current_list_file&gt;</b>
              Full path to the file doing the access.

       <b>&lt;stack&gt;</b>
              List of absolute paths of all files currently on the stack of file inclusion, with the bottom-most
              file first and the currently processed file (that is, <b>current_list_file</b>) last.

       Note that for some accesses such as <u>list(APPEND)</u>, the watcher is executed twice, first with a read access
       and then with a write one.  Also note that an <u>if(DEFINED)</u> query on the variable does not register  as  an
       access and the watcher is not executed.

       Only  non-cache variables can be watched using this command.  Access to cache variables is never watched.
       However, the existence of a cache variable <b>var</b> causes accesses to the non-cache variable <b>var</b> to  not  use
       the <b>UNKNOWN_</b> prefix, even if a non-cache variable <b>var</b> has never existed.

   <b>while</b>
       Evaluate a group of commands while a condition is true

          while(&lt;condition&gt;)
            &lt;commands&gt;
          endwhile()

       All  commands  between  while  and  the matching <u>endwhile()</u> are recorded without being invoked.  Once the
       <u>endwhile()</u> is evaluated, the recorded list of commands is invoked as long as the <b>&lt;condition&gt;</b> is true.

       The <b>&lt;condition&gt;</b> has the same syntax and is evaluated using the same logic as described at length for  the
       <u>if()</u> command.

       The commands <u>break()</u> and <u>continue()</u> provide means to escape from the normal control flow.

       Per  legacy,  the  <u>endwhile()</u>  command  admits  an  optional <b>&lt;condition&gt;</b> argument.  If used, it must be a
       verbatim repeat of the argument of the opening <b>while</b> command.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>

</pre><h4><b>PROJECT</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       These commands are available only in CMake projects.

   <b>add_compile_definitions</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       Add preprocessor definitions to the compilation of source files.

          add_compile_definitions(&lt;definition&gt; ...)

       Adds preprocessor definitions to the compiler command line.

       The preprocessor definitions are added to the <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u>  directory  property  for  the  current
       <b>CMakeLists</b>  file.  They  are also added to the <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u> target property for each target in the
       current <b>CMakeLists</b> file.

       Definitions are specified using  the  syntax  <b>VAR</b>  or  <b>VAR=value</b>.   Function-style  definitions  are  not
       supported.  CMake  will  automatically  escape the value correctly for the native build system (note that
       CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).

       Added in version 3.26: Any leading <b>-D</b> on an item will be removed.

       Arguments to <b>add_compile_definitions</b> may use generator  expressions  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See  the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • The command <u>target_compile_definitions()</u> adds target-specific definitions.

   <b>add_compile_options</b>
       Add options to the compilation of source files.

          add_compile_options(&lt;option&gt; ...)

       Adds  options  to  the <u>COMPILE_OPTIONS</u> directory property.  These options are used when compiling targets
       from the current directory and below.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          These options are not used when linking.  See the <u>add_link_options()</u> command for that.

   <b>Arguments</b>
       Arguments to  <b>add_compile_options</b>  may  use  generator  expressions  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See  the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>Option</b> <b>De-duplication</b>
       The final set of options used for a target is constructed by accumulating options from the current target
       and the usage requirements of its dependencies.  The set of options is de-duplicated to avoid repetition.

       Added  in  version  3.12:  While  beneficial for individual options, the de-duplication step can break up
       option groups.  For example, <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>-option</b> <b>B</b> becomes <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>B</b>.  One may specify a group of options
       using shell-like quoting along with a <b>SHELL:</b> prefix.  The <b>SHELL:</b> prefix is dropped, and the rest  of  the
       option  string is parsed using the <u>separate_arguments()</u> <b>UNIX_COMMAND</b> mode. For example, <b>"SHELL:-option</b> <b>A"</b>
       <b>"SHELL:-option</b> <b>B"</b> becomes <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>-option</b> <b>B</b>.

   <b>Example</b>
       Since  different  compilers  support  different  options,  a  typical  use  of  this  command  is  in   a
       compiler-specific conditional clause:

          if (MSVC)
              # warning level 4
              add_compile_options(/W4)
          else()
              # additional warnings
              add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic)

       To  set  per-language  options,  use  the  <u>$&lt;COMPILE_LANGUAGE&gt;</u> or <u>$&lt;COMPILE_LANGUAGE:languages&gt;</u> generator
       expressions.

       • This command can be used to add any options. However, for adding preprocessor definitions  and  include
         directories  it  is  recommended  to  use  the  more  specific  commands  <u>add_compile_definitions()</u> and
         <u>include_directories()</u>.

       • The command <u>target_compile_options()</u> adds target-specific options.

       • This command adds compile options for all languages.  Use the <u>COMPILE_LANGUAGE</u> generator expression  to
         specify per-language compile options.

       • The source file property <u>COMPILE_OPTIONS</u> adds options to one source file.

       • <u>add_link_options()</u> adds options for linking.

       • <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u> and <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> add language-wide flags passed to all invocations of
         the compiler.  This includes invocations that drive compiling and those that drive linking.

   <b>add_custom_command</b>
       Add a custom build rule to the generated build system.

       There are two main signatures for <b>add_custom_command</b>.

   <b>Generating</b> <b>Files</b>
       The first signature is for adding a custom command to produce an output:

          add_custom_command(OUTPUT output1 [output2 ...]
                             COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...]
                             [COMMAND command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...]
                             [MAIN_DEPENDENCY depend]
                             [DEPENDS [depends...]]
                             [BYPRODUCTS [files...]]
                             [IMPLICIT_DEPENDS &lt;lang1&gt; depend1
                                              [&lt;lang2&gt; depend2] ...]
                             [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                             [COMMENT comment]
                             [DEPFILE depfile]
                             [JOB_POOL job_pool]
                             [JOB_SERVER_AWARE &lt;bool&gt;]
                             [VERBATIM] [APPEND] [USES_TERMINAL]
                             [CODEGEN]
                             [COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS]
                             [DEPENDS_EXPLICIT_ONLY])

       This  defines  a  command  to  generate specified <b>OUTPUT</b> file(s).  A target created in the same directory
       (<b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file) that specifies any output of the custom command as a source file is given a rule to
       generate the file using the command at build time.

       Do not list the output in more than one independent target that may build in parallel or the instances of
       the rule may conflict.  Instead, use the <u>add_custom_target()</u> command to drive the command  and  make  the
       other targets depend on that one.  See the <u>Example:</u> <u>Generating</u> <u>Files</u> <u>for</u> <u>Multiple</u> <u>Targets</u> below.

       The options are:

       <b>APPEND</b> Append the <b>COMMAND</b> and <b>DEPENDS</b> option values to the custom command for the first output specified.
              There must have already been a previous call to this command with the same output.

              If  the previous call specified the output via a generator expression, the output specified by the
              current call must match in at least one configuration after evaluating generator expressions.   In
              this case, the appended commands and dependencies apply to all configurations.

              The  <b>COMMENT</b>,  <b>MAIN_DEPENDENCY</b>, and <b>WORKING_DIRECTORY</b> options are currently ignored when <b>APPEND</b> is
              given, but may be used in the future.

       <b>BYPRODUCTS</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              Specify the files the command is expected to produce but whose modification time may or may not be
              newer than the dependencies.  If a byproduct name is  a  relative  path  it  will  be  interpreted
              relative  to  the  build  tree  directory  corresponding  to  the  current source directory.  Each
              byproduct file will be marked with the <u>GENERATED</u> source file property automatically.

              <u>See</u> <u>policy</u> <u>CMP0058</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>motivation</u> <u>behind</u> <u>this</u> <u>feature.</u>

              Explicit specification of byproducts is supported by the <u>Ninja</u> generator to tell the  <b>ninja</b>  build
              tool how to regenerate byproducts when they are missing.  It is also useful when other build rules
              (e.g.  custom  commands)  depend on the byproducts.  Ninja requires a build rule for any generated
              file on which another rule depends even  if  there  are  order-only  dependencies  to  ensure  the
              byproducts will be available before their dependents build.

              The <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> will remove <b>BYPRODUCTS</b> and other <u>GENERATED</u> files during <b>make</b> <b>clean</b>.

              This  keyword  cannot be used with <b>APPEND</b> (see policy <u>CMP0175</u>).  All byproducts must be set in the
              first call to <b>add_custom_command(OUTPUT...)</b> for the output files.

              Added in version 3.20: Arguments to <b>BYPRODUCTS</b> may use a restricted set of <u>generator</u>  <u>expressions</u>.
              <u>Target-dependent</u> <u>expressions</u> are not permitted.

              Changed  in version 3.28: In targets using <u>File</u> <u>Sets</u>, custom command byproducts are now considered
              private unless they are listed in a non-private file set.  See policy <u>CMP0154</u>.

       <b>COMMAND</b>
              Specify the command-line(s) to execute at build time.  At least  one  <b>COMMAND</b>  would  normally  be
              given, but certain patterns may omit it, such as adding commands in separate calls using <u>APPEND</u>.

              If  more  than  one  <b>COMMAND</b>  is  specified,  they  will be executed in order, but <u>not</u> necessarily
              composed into a stateful shell or batch script.  To run a full script,  use  the  <u>configure_file()</u>
              command or the <u>file(GENERATE)</u> command to create it, and then specify a <b>COMMAND</b> to launch it.

              The optional <b>ARGS</b> argument is for backward compatibility and will be ignored.

              If  <b>COMMAND</b> specifies an executable target name (created by the <u>add_executable()</u> command), it will
              automatically be replaced by the location of the executable created at build time if either of the
              following is true:

              • The target is not being cross-compiled (i.e. the <u>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING</u> variable  is  not  set  to
                true).

              • Added  in version 3.6: The target is being cross-compiled and an emulator is provided (i.e.  its
                <u>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u>  target  property  is   set).    In   this   case,   the   contents   of
                <u>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u>  will  be  prepended  to  the  command before the location of the target
                executable.

              If neither of the above conditions are met, it is assumed that the command name is a program to be
              found on the <b>PATH</b> at build time.

              Arguments to <b>COMMAND</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.  Use the <u>TARGET_FILE</u> generator  expression  to
              refer  to  the  location  of a target later in the command line (i.e. as a command argument rather
              than as the command to execute).

              Whenever one of the following target based generator expressions are used as a command to  execute
              or  is  mentioned  in a command argument, a target-level dependency will be added automatically so
              that the mentioned target will be built before any target using this custom  command  (see  policy
              <u>CMP0112</u>).

                 • <b>TARGET_FILE</b>

                 • <b>TARGET_LINKER_FILE</b>

                 • <b>TARGET_SONAME_FILE</b>

                 • <b>TARGET_PDB_FILE</b>

              This  target-level  dependency  does  NOT  add a file-level dependency that would cause the custom
              command to re-run whenever the executable is recompiled.   List  target  names  with  the  <b>DEPENDS</b>
              option to add such file-level dependencies.

       <b>COMMENT</b>
              Display the given message before the commands are executed at build time.  This will be ignored if
              <b>APPEND</b> is given, although a future version may use it.

              Added in version 3.26: Arguments to <b>COMMENT</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       <b>DEPENDS</b>
              Specify  files  on  which  the  command  depends.   Each  argument is converted to a dependency as
              follows:

              1. If the argument is the name of a target (created by the <u>add_custom_target()</u>,  <u>add_executable()</u>,
                 or <u>add_library()</u> command) a target-level dependency is created to make sure the target is built
                 before  any  target using this custom command.  Additionally, if the target is an executable or
                 library, a file-level dependency is created to cause the custom command to re-run whenever  the
                 target is recompiled.

              2. If the argument is an absolute path, a file-level dependency is created on that path.

              3. If  the  argument  is  the  name of a source file that has been added to a target or on which a
                 source file property has been set, a file-level dependency is created on that source file.

              4. If the argument is a relative path and it exists in the current source directory, a  file-level
                 dependency is created on that file in the current source directory.

              5. Otherwise,  a  file-level  dependency  is  created  on that path relative to the current binary
                 directory.

              If any dependency is an <b>OUTPUT</b> of another custom command in  the  same  directory  (<b>CMakeLists.txt</b>
              file),  CMake  automatically brings the other custom command into the target in which this command
              is built.

              Added in version 3.16: A  target-level  dependency  is  added  if  any  dependency  is  listed  as
              <b>BYPRODUCTS</b>  of  a target or any of its build events in the same directory to ensure the byproducts
              will be available.

              If <b>DEPENDS</b> is not specified, the command will run whenever the <b>OUTPUT</b> is missing; if  the  command
              does not actually create the <b>OUTPUT</b>, the rule will always run.

              Added in version 3.1: Arguments to <b>DEPENDS</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       <b>COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS</b>
              Added in version 3.8.

              Lists  in  <b>COMMAND</b> arguments will be expanded, including those created with <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>,
              allowing            <b>COMMAND</b>            arguments             such             as             <b>${CC}</b>
              <b>"-I$&lt;JOIN:$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES&gt;,;-I&gt;"</b> <b>foo.cc</b> to be properly expanded.

              This  keyword cannot be used with <b>APPEND</b> (see policy <u>CMP0175</u>).  If the appended commands need this
              option to be set, it must be set on the first call to <b>add_custom_command(OUTPUT...)</b> for the output
              files.

       <b>CODEGEN</b>
              Added in version 3.31.

              Adds the custom command to a global <b>codegen</b> target that can be used to execute the custom  command
              while avoiding the majority of the build graph.

              This option is supported only by <u>Ninja</u> <u>Generators</u> and <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u>, and is ignored by other
              generators.  Furthermore, this option is allowed only if policy <u>CMP0171</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>.

              This  keyword  cannot  be  used with <b>APPEND</b> (see policy <u>CMP0175</u>).  It can only be set on the first
              call to <b>add_custom_command(OUTPUT...)</b>  for the output files.

       <b>IMPLICIT_DEPENDS</b>
              Request scanning of implicit dependencies of an input file.   The  language  given  specifies  the
              programming  language whose corresponding dependency scanner should be used.  Currently only <b>C</b> and
              <b>CXX</b> language scanners are supported.  The language has to be  specified  for  every  file  in  the
              <b>IMPLICIT_DEPENDS</b> list.  Dependencies discovered from the scanning are added to those of the custom
              command  at  build  time.   Note  that the <b>IMPLICIT_DEPENDS</b> option is currently supported only for
              Makefile generators and will be ignored by other generators.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This option cannot be specified at the same time as <b>DEPFILE</b> option.

       <b>JOB_POOL</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              Specify a <u>pool</u> for the <u>Ninja</u> generator. Incompatible with <b>USES_TERMINAL</b>, which implies the <b>console</b>
              pool.  Using a pool that is not defined by <u>JOB_POOLS</u> causes an error by ninja at build time.

              This keyword cannot be used with <b>APPEND</b> (see policy <u>CMP0175</u>).  Job pools can only be specified  in
              the first call to <b>add_custom_command(OUTPUT...)</b> for the output files.

       <b>JOB_SERVER_AWARE</b>
              Added in version 3.28.

              Specify that the command is GNU Make job server aware.

              For  the <u>Unix</u> <u>Makefiles</u>, <u>MSYS</u> <u>Makefiles</u>, and <u>MinGW</u> <u>Makefiles</u> generators this will add the <b>+</b> prefix
              to the recipe line. See the <u>GNU</u> <u>Make</u> <u>Documentation</u> for more information.

              This option is silently ignored by other generators.

              This keyword cannot be used with <b>APPEND</b> (see policy <u>CMP0175</u>).  Job server awareness  can  only  be
              specified in the first call to <b>add_custom_command(OUTPUT...)</b> for the output files.

       <b>MAIN_DEPENDENCY</b>
              Specify  the  primary input source file to the command.  This is treated just like any value given
              to the <b>DEPENDS</b> option but also suggests to Visual Studio  generators  where  to  hang  the  custom
              command.  Each  source  file  may have at most one command specifying it as its main dependency. A
              compile command (i.e. for a library or an executable) counts as an implicit main dependency  which
              gets silently overwritten by a custom command specification.

              This option is currently ignored if <b>APPEND</b> is given, but a future version may use it.

       <b>OUTPUT</b> Specify the output files the command is expected to produce.  Each output file will be marked with
              the  <u>GENERATED</u>  source  file  property  automatically.  If the output of the custom command is not
              actually created as a file on disk it should be marked with the <u>SYMBOLIC</u> source file property.

              If an output file name is a relative path, its absolute path  is  determined  by  interpreting  it
              relative to:

              1. the  build  directory corresponding to the current source directory (<u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u>),
                 or

              2. the current source directory (<u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>).

              The path in the build directory is preferred unless the path in the source tree is mentioned as an
              absolute source file path elsewhere in the current directory.

              The output file path may not contain <b>&lt;</b> or <b>&gt;</b> characters.

              Added in version 3.20: Arguments to <b>OUTPUT</b> may use a  restricted  set  of  <u>generator</u>  <u>expressions</u>.
              <u>Target-dependent</u> <u>expressions</u> are not permitted.

              Changed  in  version  3.28:  In targets using <u>File</u> <u>Sets</u>, custom command outputs are now considered
              private unless they are listed in a non-private file set.  See policy <u>CMP0154</u>.

              Changed in version 3.30: The output file path may now use <b>#</b>  characters,  except  when  using  the
              <u>Borland</u> <u>Makefiles</u> generator.

       <b>USES_TERMINAL</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              The  command  will  be given direct access to the terminal if possible.  With the <u>Ninja</u> generator,
              this places the command in the <b>console</b> <u>pool</u>.

              This keyword cannot be used with <b>APPEND</b> (see policy  <u>CMP0175</u>).   If  the  appended  commands  need
              access  to the terminal, it must be set on the first call to <b>add_custom_command(OUTPUT...)</b> for the
              output files.

       <b>VERBATIM</b>
              All arguments to the commands will be escaped properly for the build  tool  so  that  the  invoked
              command  receives  each  argument  unchanged.  Note that one level of escapes is still used by the
              CMake language processor before add_custom_command even sees the arguments.  Use  of  <b>VERBATIM</b>  is
              recommended  as  it enables correct behavior.  When <b>VERBATIM</b> is not given the behavior is platform
              specific because there is no protection of tool-specific special characters.

              This keyword cannot be used with <b>APPEND</b> (see policy <u>CMP0175</u>).  If the appended commands need to be
              treated as <b>VERBATIM</b>, it must be set on the first call  to  <b>add_custom_command(OUTPUT...)</b>  for  the
              output files.

       <b>WORKING_DIRECTORY</b>
              Execute  the  command with the given current working directory.  If it is a relative path, it will
              be interpreted relative to the build tree directory corresponding to the current source directory.

              This option is currently ignored if <b>APPEND</b> is given, but a future version may use it.

              Added in version 3.13: Arguments to <b>WORKING_DIRECTORY</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       <b>DEPFILE</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Specify a depfile which holds dependencies for the custom command. It is usually  emitted  by  the
              custom  command  itself.   This keyword may only be used if the generator supports it, as detailed
              below.

              The expected format, compatible with what is generated by <b>gcc</b> with the option <b>-M</b>,  is  independent
              of the generator or platform.

              The formal syntax, as specified using <u>BNF</u> notation with the regular extensions, is the following:

              <b>depfile</b>       ::= <u>rule</u>*
              <b>rule</b>          ::= <u>targets</u> (':' (<u>separator</u> <u>dependencies</u>?)?)? <u>eol</u>
              <b>targets</b>       ::= <u>target</u> (<u>separator</u> <u>target</u>)* <u>separator</u>*
              <b>target</b>        ::= <u>pathname</u>
              <b>dependencies</b>  ::= <u>dependency</u> (<u>separator</u> <u>dependency</u>)* <u>separator</u>*
              <b>dependency</b>    ::= <u>pathname</u>
              <b>separator</b>     ::= (<u>space</u> | <u>line_continue</u>)+
              <b>line_continue</b> ::= '\' <u>eol</u>
              <b>space</b>         ::= ' ' | '\t'
              <b>pathname</b>      ::= <u>character</u>+
              <b>character</b>     ::= <u>std_character</u> | <u>dollar</u> | <u>hash</u> | <u>whitespace</u>
              <b>std_character</b> ::= &lt;any character except '$', '#' or ' '&gt;
              <b>dollar</b>        ::= '$$'
              <b>hash</b>          ::= '\#'
              <b>whitespace</b>    ::= '\ '
              <b>eol</b>           ::= '\r'? '\n'

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 As part of <b>pathname</b>, any slash and backslash is interpreted as a directory separator.

              Added in version 3.7: The <u>Ninja</u> generator supports <b>DEPFILE</b> since the keyword was first added.

              Added  in  version  3.17:  Added  the <u>Ninja</u> <u>Multi-Config</u> generator, which included support for the
              <b>DEPFILE</b> keyword.

              Added in version 3.20: Added support for <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 <b>DEPFILE</b> cannot be specified at the same  time  as  the  <b>IMPLICIT_DEPENDS</b>  option  for  <u>Makefile</u>
                 <u>Generators</u>.

              Added  in version 3.21: Added support for <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> with VS 2012 and above, and for
              the <u>Xcode</u> generator.  Support for <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> was also added.

              Added in version 3.29: The <u>Ninja</u> <u>Generators</u> will now incorporate the dependencies into  its  "deps
              log" database if the file is not listed in <b>OUTPUTS</b> or <b>BYPRODUCTS</b>.

              Using <b>DEPFILE</b> with generators other than those listed above is an error.

              If  the  <b>DEPFILE</b>  argument is relative, it should be relative to <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u>, and any
              relative paths inside the <b>DEPFILE</b> should also be relative to <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u>.  See policy
              <u>CMP0116</u>, which is always <b>NEW</b> for <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u>, <u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u>,  and  the  <u>Xcode</u>
              generator.

              This  keyword  cannot  be  used with <b>APPEND</b> (see policy <u>CMP0175</u>).  Depfiles can only be set on the
              first call to <b>add_custom_command(OUTPUT...)</b> for the output files.

       <b>DEPENDS_EXPLICIT_ONLY</b>
          Added in version 3.27.

          Indicates that the command's <b>DEPENDS</b> argument  represents  all  files  required  by  the  command  and
          implicit dependencies are not required.

          Without  this  option,  if  any target uses the output of the custom command, CMake will consider that
          target's dependencies as implicit dependencies for the custom command  in  case  this  custom  command
          requires files implicitly created by those targets.

          This      option      can     be     enabled     on     all     custom     commands     by     setting
          <u>CMAKE_ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND_DEPENDS_EXPLICIT_ONLY</u> to <b>ON</b>.

          This keyword cannot be used with <b>APPEND</b> (see policy <u>CMP0175</u>).  It can only be set on the first call to
          <b>add_custom_command(OUTPUT...)</b>  for the output files.

          Only the <u>Ninja</u> <u>Generators</u> actually use this information to remove unnecessary implicit dependencies.

          See also the <u>OPTIMIZE_DEPENDENCIES</u> target property, which may provide another  way  for  reducing  the
          impact of target dependencies in some scenarios.

   <b>Examples:</b> <b>Generating</b> <b>Files</b>
       Custom commands may be used to generate source files.  For example, the code:

          add_custom_command(
            OUTPUT out.c
            COMMAND someTool -i ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt
                             -o out.c
            DEPENDS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt
            VERBATIM)
          add_library(myLib out.c)

       adds  a custom command to run <b>someTool</b> to generate <b>out.c</b> and then compile the generated source as part of
       a library.  The generation rule will re-run whenever <b>in.txt</b> changes.

       Added in version 3.20: One may use generator  expressions  to  specify  per-configuration  outputs.   For
       example, the code:

          add_custom_command(
            OUTPUT "out-$&lt;CONFIG&gt;.c"
            COMMAND someTool -i ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt
                             -o "out-$&lt;CONFIG&gt;.c"
                             -c "$&lt;CONFIG&gt;"
            DEPENDS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt
            VERBATIM)
          add_library(myLib "out-$&lt;CONFIG&gt;.c")

       adds  a  custom  command  to  run  <b>someTool</b>  to  generate  <b>out-&lt;config&gt;.c</b>,  where  <b>&lt;config&gt;</b>  is the build
       configuration, and then compile the generated source as part of a library.

       Added in version 3.31: Use the <b>CODEGEN</b> option to add a custom command's outputs to  the  builtin  <b>codegen</b>
       target.  This is useful to make generated code available for
        static analysis without building the entire project.  For example:

          add_executable(someTool someTool.c)

          add_custom_command(
            OUTPUT out.c
            COMMAND someTool -o out.c
            CODEGEN)

          add_library(myLib out.c)

       A user may build the <b>codegen</b> target to generate <b>out.c</b>.  <b>someTool</b> is built as dependency, but <b>myLib</b> is not
       built at all.

   <b>Example:</b> <b>Generating</b> <b>Files</b> <b>for</b> <b>Multiple</b> <b>Targets</b>
       If  multiple  independent  targets  need  the same custom command output, it must be attached to a single
       custom target on which they all depend.  Consider the following example:

          add_custom_command(
            OUTPUT table.csv
            COMMAND makeTable -i ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/input.dat
                              -o table.csv
            DEPENDS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/input.dat
            VERBATIM)
          add_custom_target(generate_table_csv DEPENDS table.csv)

          add_custom_command(
            OUTPUT foo.cxx
            COMMAND genFromTable -i table.csv -case foo -o foo.cxx
            DEPENDS table.csv           # file-level dependency
                    generate_table_csv  # target-level dependency
            VERBATIM)
          add_library(foo foo.cxx)

          add_custom_command(
            OUTPUT bar.cxx
            COMMAND genFromTable -i table.csv -case bar -o bar.cxx
            DEPENDS table.csv           # file-level dependency
                    generate_table_csv  # target-level dependency
            VERBATIM)
          add_library(bar bar.cxx)

       Output <b>foo.cxx</b> is needed only by target <b>foo</b> and output <b>bar.cxx</b> is needed only by  target  <b>bar</b>,  but  <u>both</u>
       targets  need  <b>table.csv</b>,  transitively.   Since  <b>foo</b>  and  <b>bar</b>  are  independent  targets that may build
       concurrently, we prevent them from racing to generate <b>table.csv</b>  by  placing  its  custom  command  in  a
       separate  target,  <b>generate_table_csv</b>.  The custom commands generating <b>foo.cxx</b> and <b>bar.cxx</b> each specify a
       target-level dependency on <b>generate_table_csv</b>, so the targets using them, <b>foo</b> and  <b>bar</b>,  will  not  build
       until after target <b>generate_table_csv</b> is built.

   <b>Build</b> <b>Events</b>
       The  second  signature adds a custom command to a target such as a library or executable.  This is useful
       for performing an operation before or after building the target.  The command becomes part of the  target
       and  will only execute when the target itself is built.  If the target is already built, the command will
       not execute.

          add_custom_command(TARGET &lt;target&gt;
                             PRE_BUILD | PRE_LINK | POST_BUILD
                             COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...]
                             [COMMAND command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...]
                             [BYPRODUCTS [files...]]
                             [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                             [COMMENT comment]
                             [VERBATIM]
                             [COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS]
                             [USES_TERMINAL])

       This defines a new command that will be associated with building the specified  <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>.   The  <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>
       must be defined in the current directory; targets defined in other directories may not be specified.

       When the command will happen is determined by which of the following is specified:

       <b>PRE_BUILD</b>
              This  option  has  unique behavior for the <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>.  When using one of the Visual
              Studio generators, the command will run before any other rules are  executed  within  the  target.
              With  all other generators, this option behaves the same as <b>PRE_LINK</b> instead.  Because of this, it
              is recommended to avoid using <b>PRE_BUILD</b> except when it is known that a Visual Studio generator  is
              being used.

       <b>PRE_LINK</b>
              Run  after  sources  have  been compiled but before linking the binary or running the librarian or
              archiver  tool  of  a  static  library.   This  is  not  defined  for  targets  created   by   the
              <u>add_custom_target()</u> command.

       <b>POST_BUILD</b>
              Run after all other rules within the target have been executed.

       Projects  should  always  specify one of the above three keywords when using the <b>TARGET</b> form.  See policy
       <u>CMP0175</u>.

       All  other  keywords  shown  in  the  signature  above  have  the  same  meaning  as  they  do  for   the
       <u>add_custom_command(OUTPUT)</u> form of the command.  At least one <b>COMMAND</b> must be given, see policy <u>CMP0175</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Because  generator  expressions can be used in custom commands, it is possible to define <b>COMMAND</b> lines
          or whole custom commands which evaluate to empty  strings  for  certain  configurations.   For  <u>Visual</u>
          <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u>  these  command  lines  or  custom  commands  will  be  omitted  for  the  specific
          configuration and no "empty-string-command" will be added.

          This allows adding individual build events for every configuration.

       Added in version 3.21: Support for target-dependent generator expressions.

       Added in version 3.29: The <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> may be an <u>ALIAS</u> <u>target</u>.

   <b>Examples:</b> <b>Build</b> <b>Events</b>
       A <b>POST_BUILD</b> event may be used to post-process a binary after linking.  For example, the code:

          add_executable(myExe myExe.c)
          add_custom_command(
            TARGET myExe POST_BUILD
            COMMAND someHasher -i "$&lt;TARGET_FILE:myExe&gt;"
                               -o "$&lt;TARGET_FILE:myExe&gt;.hash"
            VERBATIM)

       will run <b>someHasher</b> to produce a <b>.hash</b> file next to the executable after linking.

       Added in version 3.20: One may use generator expressions to specify  per-configuration  byproducts.   For
       example, the code:

          add_library(myPlugin MODULE myPlugin.c)
          add_custom_command(
            TARGET myPlugin POST_BUILD
            COMMAND someHasher -i "$&lt;TARGET_FILE:myPlugin&gt;"
                               --as-code "myPlugin-hash-$&lt;CONFIG&gt;.c"
            BYPRODUCTS "myPlugin-hash-$&lt;CONFIG&gt;.c"
            VERBATIM)
          add_executable(myExe myExe.c "myPlugin-hash-$&lt;CONFIG&gt;.c")

       will  run  <b>someHasher</b> after linking <b>myPlugin</b>, e.g. to produce a <b>.c</b> file containing code to check the hash
       of <b>myPlugin</b> that the <b>myExe</b> executable can use to verify it before loading.

   <b>Ninja</b> <b>Multi-Config</b>
       Added in version 3.20:  <b>add_custom_command</b>  supports  the  <u>Ninja</u>  <u>Multi-Config</u>  generator's  cross-config
       capabilities. See the generator documentation for more information.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • <u>add_custom_target()</u>

   <b>add_custom_target</b>
       Add a target with no output so it will always be built.

          add_custom_target(Name [ALL] [command1 [args1...]]
                            [COMMAND command2 [args2...] ...]

                            [COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS]
                            [SOURCES src1 [src2...]])

       Adds a target with the given name that executes the given commands.  The target has no output file and is
       <u>always</u> <u>considered</u> <u>out</u> <u>of</u> <u>date</u> even if the commands try to create a file with the name of the target.  Use
       the <u>add_custom_command()</u> command to generate a file with dependencies.  By default nothing depends on the
       custom target.  Use the <u>add_dependencies()</u> command to add dependencies to or from other targets.

       The options are:

       <b>ALL</b>    Indicate that this target should be added to the default build target so that it will be run every
              time (the command cannot be called <b>ALL</b>).

       <b>BYPRODUCTS</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              Specify the files the command is expected to produce but whose modification time may or may not be
              updated  on  subsequent  builds.   If  a  byproduct name is a relative path it will be interpreted
              relative to the build  tree  directory  corresponding  to  the  current  source  directory.   Each
              byproduct file will be marked with the <u>GENERATED</u> source file property automatically.

              <u>See</u> <u>policy</u> <u>CMP0058</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>motivation</u> <u>behind</u> <u>this</u> <u>feature.</u>

              Explicit  specification  of byproducts is supported by the <u>Ninja</u> generator to tell the <b>ninja</b> build
              tool how to regenerate byproducts when they are missing.  It is also useful when other build rules
              (e.g. custom commands) depend on the byproducts.  Ninja requires a build rule  for  any  generated
              file  on  which  another  rule  depends  even  if  there are order-only dependencies to ensure the
              byproducts will be available before their dependents build.

              The <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> will remove <b>BYPRODUCTS</b> and other <u>GENERATED</u> files during <b>make</b> <b>clean</b>.

              Added in version 3.20: Arguments to <b>BYPRODUCTS</b> may use a restricted set of <u>generator</u>  <u>expressions</u>.
              <u>Target-dependent</u> <u>expressions</u> are not permitted.

              Changed  in version 3.28: In custom targets using <u>File</u> <u>Sets</u>, byproducts are now considered private
              unless they are listed in a non-private file set.  See policy <u>CMP0154</u>.

       <b>COMMAND</b>
              Specify the command-line(s) to execute at build time.  If more than one <b>COMMAND</b> is specified  they
              will  be  executed  in  order, but <u>not</u> necessarily composed into a stateful shell or batch script.
              (To run a full script, use the <u>configure_file()</u> command or the <u>file(GENERATE)</u>  command  to  create
              it, and then specify a <b>COMMAND</b> to launch it.)

              If  <b>COMMAND</b> specifies an executable target name (created by the <u>add_executable()</u> command), it will
              automatically be replaced by the location of the executable created at build time if either of the
              following is true:

              • The target is not being cross-compiled (i.e. the <u>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING</u> variable  is  not  set  to
                true).

              • Added  in version 3.6: The target is being cross-compiled and an emulator is provided (i.e.  its
                <u>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u>  target  property  is   set).    In   this   case,   the   contents   of
                <u>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u>  will  be  prepended  to  the  command before the location of the target
                executable.

              If neither of the above conditions are met, it is assumed that the command name is a program to be
              found on the <b>PATH</b> at build time.

              Arguments to <b>COMMAND</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.  Use the <u>TARGET_FILE</u> generator  expression  to
              refer  to  the  location  of a target later in the command line (i.e. as a command argument rather
              than as the command to execute).

              Whenever one of the following target based generator expressions are used as a command to  execute
              or  is  mentioned  in a command argument, a target-level dependency will be added automatically so
              that the mentioned target will be built before this custom target (see policy <u>CMP0112</u>).

                 • <b>TARGET_FILE</b>

                 • <b>TARGET_LINKER_FILE</b>

                 • <b>TARGET_SONAME_FILE</b>

                 • <b>TARGET_PDB_FILE</b>

              The command and arguments are optional and if not specified an empty target will be created.

       <b>COMMENT</b>
              Display the given message before the commands are executed at build time.

              Added in version 3.26: Arguments to <b>COMMENT</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       <b>DEPENDS</b>
              Reference files and outputs of custom commands created with <u>add_custom_command()</u> command calls  in
              the  same  directory  (<b>CMakeLists.txt</b>  file).   They will be brought up to date when the target is
              built.

              Changed in version 3.16: A target-level dependency is added if any dependency is a byproduct of  a
              target or any of its build events in the same directory to ensure the byproducts will be available
              before this target is built.

              Use the <u>add_dependencies()</u> command to add dependencies on other targets.

       <b>COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS</b>
              Added in version 3.8.

              Lists  in  <b>COMMAND</b> arguments will be expanded, including those created with <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>,
              allowing            <b>COMMAND</b>            arguments             such             as             <b>${CC}</b>
              <b>"-I$&lt;JOIN:$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES&gt;,;-I&gt;"</b> <b>foo.cc</b> to be properly expanded.

       <b>JOB_POOL</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              Specify a <u>pool</u> for the <u>Ninja</u> generator. Incompatible with <b>USES_TERMINAL</b>, which implies the <b>console</b>
              pool.  Using a pool that is not defined by <u>JOB_POOLS</u> causes an error by ninja at build time.

       <b>JOB_SERVER_AWARE</b>
              Added in version 3.28.

              Specify that the command is GNU Make job server aware.

              For  the <u>Unix</u> <u>Makefiles</u>, <u>MSYS</u> <u>Makefiles</u>, and <u>MinGW</u> <u>Makefiles</u> generators this will add the <b>+</b> prefix
              to the recipe line. See the <u>GNU</u> <u>Make</u> <u>Documentation</u> for more information.

              This option is silently ignored by other generators.

       <b>SOURCES</b>
              Specify additional source files to be included in the custom target.  Specified source files  will
              be added to IDE project files for convenience in editing even if they have no build rules.

       <b>VERBATIM</b>
              All  arguments  to  the  commands  will be escaped properly for the build tool so that the invoked
              command receives each argument unchanged.  Note that one level of escapes is  still  used  by  the
              CMake  language  processor  before  <b>add_custom_target</b> even sees the arguments.  Use of <b>VERBATIM</b> is
              recommended as it enables correct behavior.  When <b>VERBATIM</b> is not given the behavior  is  platform
              specific because there is no protection of tool-specific special characters.

       <b>USES_TERMINAL</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              The  command  will  be given direct access to the terminal if possible.  With the <u>Ninja</u> generator,
              this places the command in the <b>console</b> <u>pool</u>.

       <b>WORKING_DIRECTORY</b>
              Execute the command with the given current working directory.  If it is a relative path it will be
              interpreted relative to the build tree directory corresponding to the current source directory.

              Added in version 3.13: Arguments to <b>WORKING_DIRECTORY</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

   <b>Ninja</b> <b>Multi-Config</b>
       Added in version  3.20:  <b>add_custom_target</b>  supports  the  <u>Ninja</u>  <u>Multi-Config</u>  generator's  cross-config
       capabilities. See the generator documentation for more information.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • <u>add_custom_command()</u>

   <b>add_definitions</b>
       Add <b>-D</b> define flags to the compilation of source files.

          add_definitions(-DFOO -DBAR ...)

       Adds  definitions to the compiler command line for targets in the current directory, whether added before
       or after this command is invoked, and for the ones in sub-directories added after. This  command  can  be
       used to add any flags, but it is intended to add preprocessor definitions.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This command has been superseded by alternatives:

          • Use <u>add_compile_definitions()</u> to add preprocessor definitions.

          • Use <u>include_directories()</u> to add include directories.

          • Use <u>add_compile_options()</u> to add other options.

       Flags  beginning  in  <b>-D</b>  or  <b>/D</b>  that  look like preprocessor definitions are automatically added to the
       <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u> directory property for the current directory.  Definitions  with  non-trivial  values
       may  be  left in the set of flags instead of being converted for reasons of backwards compatibility.  See
       documentation of the <u>directory</u>, <u>target</u>, <u>source</u> <u>file</u> <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b> properties for details on  adding
       preprocessor definitions to specific scopes and configurations.

   <b>add_dependencies</b>
       Add a dependency between top-level targets.

          add_dependencies(&lt;target&gt; [&lt;target-dependency&gt;]...)

       Makes  a  top-level  <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> depend on other top-level targets to ensure that they build before <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>
       does.   A  top-level  target  is  one  created  by  one  of  the  <u>add_executable()</u>,   <u>add_library()</u>,   or
       <u>add_custom_target()</u> commands (but not targets generated by CMake like <b>install</b>).

       Dependencies  added  to an <u>imported</u> <u>target</u> or an <u>interface</u> <u>library</u> are followed transitively in its place
       since the target itself does not build.

       Added in version 3.3: Allow adding dependencies to interface libraries.

       Added in version 3.8: Dependencies will populate the <u>MANUALLY_ADDED_DEPENDENCIES</u> property of <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>.

       Changed in version 3.9: The <u>Ninja</u> <u>Generators</u> use weaker  ordering  than  other  generators  in  order  to
       improve  available  concurrency.  They only guarantee that the dependencies' custom commands are finished
       before sources in <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> start compiling; this ensures generated sources are available.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • The <b>DEPENDS</b> option of <u>add_custom_target()</u>  and  <u>add_custom_command()</u>  commands  for  adding  file-level
         dependencies in custom rules.

       • The <u>OBJECT_DEPENDS</u> source file property to add file-level dependencies to object files.

   <b>add_executable</b>
       Add an executable to the project using the specified source files.

   <b>Normal</b> <b>Executables</b>
       <b>add_executable(&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>&lt;options&gt;...</b> <b>&lt;sources&gt;...)</b>
              Add  an  executable  target  called <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> to be built from the source files listed in the command
              invocation.

              The options are:

              <b>WIN32</b>  Set the <u>WIN32_EXECUTABLE</u> target property automatically.  See documentation of  that  target
                     property for details.

              <b>MACOSX_BUNDLE</b>
                     Set  the  <u>MACOSX_BUNDLE</u>  target  property  automatically.  See documentation of that target
                     property for details.

              <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b>
                     Set the <u>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</u> target property automatically.  See documentation of  that  target
                     property for details.

       The  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>  corresponds  to  the  logical target name and must be globally unique within a project.  The
       actual file name of the executable built is constructed based on conventions of the native platform (such
       as <b>&lt;name&gt;.exe</b> or just <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>).

       Added in version 3.1: Source arguments to <b>add_executable</b> may use "generator expressions" with the  syntax
       <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.

       Added in version 3.11: The source files can be omitted if they are added later using <u>target_sources()</u>.

       By  default  the  executable file will be created in the build tree directory corresponding to the source
       tree directory in which the command was  invoked.   See  documentation  of  the  <u>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u>
       target  property to change this location.  See documentation of the <u>OUTPUT_NAME</u> target property to change
       the <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> part of the final file name.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

       See also <u>HEADER_FILE_ONLY</u> on what to do if some sources are pre-processed,  and  you  want  to  have  the
       original sources reachable from within IDE.

   <b>Imported</b> <b>Executables</b>
       <b>add_executable(&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>IMPORTED</b> <b>[GLOBAL])</b>
              Add  an  <u>IMPORTED</u>  <u>executable</u>  <u>target</u> to reference an executable file located outside the project.
              The target name may be referenced like any target built within the project, except that by default
              it is visible only in the directory in which it is created, and below.

              The options are:

              <b>GLOBAL</b> Make the target name globally visible.

       No rules are generated to build imported targets, and the <u>IMPORTED</u> target  property  is  <b>True</b>.   Imported
       executables are useful for convenient reference from commands like <u>add_custom_command()</u>.

       Details about the imported executable are specified by setting properties whose names begin in <b>IMPORTED_</b>.
       The   most   important   such   property   is   <u>IMPORTED_LOCATION</u>   (and  its  per-configuration  version
       <u>IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>) which specifies the location of  the  main  executable  file  on  disk.   See
       documentation of the <b>IMPORTED_*</b> properties for more information.

   <b>Alias</b> <b>Executables</b>
       <b>add_executable(&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>ALIAS</b> <b>&lt;target&gt;)</b>
              Creates an <u>Alias</u> <u>Target</u>, such that <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> can be used to refer to <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> in subsequent commands.
              The <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> does not appear in the generated buildsystem as a make target.  The <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> may not be
              an <b>ALIAS</b>.

       Added in version 3.11: An <b>ALIAS</b> can target a <b>GLOBAL</b> <u>Imported</u> <u>Target</u>

       Added  in  version  3.18:  An  <b>ALIAS</b> can target a non-<b>GLOBAL</b> Imported Target. Such alias is scoped to the
       directory in which it is created and subdirectories.  The <u>ALIAS_GLOBAL</u> target property  can  be  used  to
       check if the alias is global or not.

       <b>ALIAS</b>  targets can be used as targets to read properties from, executables for custom commands and custom
       targets.  They can also be tested for existence with the regular <u>if(TARGET)</u> subcommand.  The  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>  may
       not  be  used  to  modify  properties  of  <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>,  that  is,  it  may  not  be  used as the operand of
       <u>set_property()</u>, <u>set_target_properties()</u>,  <u>target_link_libraries()</u>  etc.   An  <b>ALIAS</b>  target  may  not  be
       installed or exported.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • <u>add_library()</u>

   <b>add_library</b>
       Add a library to the project using the specified source files.

   <b>Normal</b> <b>Libraries</b>
       <b>add_library(&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;type&gt;]</b> <b>[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]</b> <b>&lt;sources&gt;...)</b>
              Add  a  library  target  called  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>  to  be  built from the source files listed in the command
              invocation.

              The optional <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> specifies the type of library to be created:

              <b>STATIC</b> An archive of object files for use when linking other targets.

              <b>SHARED</b> A dynamic library that may be linked by other targets and loaded at runtime.

              <b>MODULE</b> A plugin that may not be linked by other targets, but may be dynamically loaded at  runtime
                     using dlopen-like functionality.

              If  no <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> is given the default is <b>STATIC</b> or <b>SHARED</b> based on the value of the <u>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</u>
              variable.

              The options are:

              <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b>
                     Set the <u>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</u> target property automatically.  See documentation of  that  target
                     property for details.

       The  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>  corresponds  to  the  logical target name and must be globally unique within a project.  The
       actual file name of the library built is constructed based on conventions of the native platform (such as
       <b>lib&lt;name&gt;.a</b> or <b>&lt;name&gt;.lib</b>).

       Added in version 3.1: Source arguments to <b>add_library</b> may use "generator  expressions"  with  the  syntax
       <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.

       Added in version 3.11: The source files can be omitted if they are added later using <u>target_sources()</u>.

       For <b>SHARED</b> and <b>MODULE</b> libraries the <u>POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</u> target property is set to <b>ON</b> automatically.
       A <b>SHARED</b> library may be marked with the <u>FRAMEWORK</u> target property to create an macOS Framework.

       Added  in  version  3.8:  A  <b>STATIC</b>  library may be marked with the <u>FRAMEWORK</u> target property to create a
       static Framework.

       If a library does not export any symbols, it must not be declared as a <b>SHARED</b> library.   For  example,  a
       Windows resource DLL or a managed C++/CLI DLL that exports no unmanaged symbols would need to be a <b>MODULE</b>
       library.   This  is because CMake expects a <b>SHARED</b> library to always have an associated import library on
       Windows.

       By default the library file will be created in the build tree directory corresponding to the source  tree
       directory  in  which  the  command  was  invoked.   See  documentation  of  the <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u>,
       <u>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u>, and <u>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u> target properties to change  this  location.   See
       documentation of the <u>OUTPUT_NAME</u> target property to change the <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> part of the final file name.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

       See  also  <u>HEADER_FILE_ONLY</u>  on  what  to  do if some sources are pre-processed, and you want to have the
       original sources reachable from within IDE.

       Changed in version 3.30: On platforms that do not support shared  libraries,  <b>add_library</b>  now  fails  on
       calls  creating  <b>SHARED</b> libraries instead of automatically converting them to <b>STATIC</b> libraries as before.
       See policy <u>CMP0164</u>.

   <b>Object</b> <b>Libraries</b>
       <b>add_library(&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>OBJECT</b> <b>&lt;sources&gt;...)</b>
              Add an <u>Object</u> <u>Library</u> to compile source files without archiving or linking their object files into
              a library.

       Other targets created by <b>add_library</b> or <u>add_executable()</u> may reference the objects using an expression of
       the form <u>$&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib&gt;</u> as a source, where <b>objlib</b> is the object library name.  For example:

          add_library(... $&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib&gt; ...)
          add_executable(... $&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib&gt; ...)

       will include objlib's object files in a library and an executable along with those  compiled  from  their
       own  sources.  Object libraries may contain only sources that compile, header files, and other files that
       would not affect linking of a normal library (e.g. <b>.txt</b>).  They may contain  custom  commands  generating
       such  sources,  but  not <b>PRE_BUILD</b>, <b>PRE_LINK</b>, or <b>POST_BUILD</b> commands.  Some native build systems (such as
       Xcode) may not like targets that have only object files, so consider adding at least one real source file
       to any target that references <u>$&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib&gt;</u>.

       Added in version 3.12: Object libraries can be linked to with <u>target_link_libraries()</u>.

   <b>Interface</b> <b>Libraries</b>
       <b>add_library(&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>INTERFACE)</b>
              Add an <u>Interface</u> <u>Library</u> target that may specify usage requirements for dependents  but  does  not
              compile sources and does not produce a library artifact on disk.

              An  interface  library  with  no  source  files  is  not  included  as  a  target in the generated
              buildsystem.  However, it may have properties set on it and it  may  be  installed  and  exported.
              Typically, <b>INTERFACE_*</b> properties are populated on an interface target using the commands:

              • <u>set_property()</u>,

              • <u>target_link_libraries(INTERFACE)</u>,

              • <u>target_link_options(INTERFACE)</u>,

              • <u>target_include_directories(INTERFACE)</u>,

              • <u>target_compile_options(INTERFACE)</u>,

              • <u>target_compile_definitions(INTERFACE)</u>, and

              • <u>target_sources(INTERFACE)</u>,

              and then it is used as an argument to <u>target_link_libraries()</u> like any other target.

              Added  in version 3.15: An interface library can have <u>PUBLIC_HEADER</u> and <u>PRIVATE_HEADER</u> properties.
              The headers specified by those properties can be installed using the <u>install(TARGETS)</u> command.

       <b>add_library(&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>INTERFACE</b> <b>[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]</b> <b>&lt;sources&gt;...)</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              Add an <u>Interface</u> <u>Library</u>  target  with  source  files  (in  addition  to  usage  requirements  and
              properties  as  documented  by  the  <u>above</u> <u>signature</u>).  Source files may be listed directly in the
              <b>add_library</b> call or added later by calls to <u>target_sources()</u> with the <b>PRIVATE</b> or <b>PUBLIC</b> keywords.

              If an interface library has source files (i.e. the <u>SOURCES</u> target property is set), or header sets
              (i.e. the <u>HEADER_SETS</u> target property is set), it will appear in the generated  buildsystem  as  a
              build  target  much like a target defined by the <u>add_custom_target()</u> command.  It does not compile
              any sources, but does contain build rules for custom commands created by the  <u>add_custom_command()</u>
              command.

              The options are:

              <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b>
                     Set  the  <u>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</u> target property automatically.  See documentation of that target
                     property for details.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 In most command signatures where the <b>INTERFACE</b> keyword appears, the items listed after it  only
                 become  part of that target's usage requirements and are not part of the target's own settings.
                 However, in this signature of <b>add_library</b>, the <b>INTERFACE</b> keyword refers  to  the  library  type
                 only.  Sources listed after it in the <b>add_library</b> call are <b>PRIVATE</b> to the interface library and
                 do not appear in its <u>INTERFACE_SOURCES</u> target property.

   <b>Imported</b> <b>Libraries</b>
       <b>add_library(&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> <b>IMPORTED</b> <b>[GLOBAL])</b>
              Add  an  <u>IMPORTED</u> <u>library</u> <u>target</u> called <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>.  The target name may be referenced like any target
              built within the project, except that by default it is visible only in the directory in  which  it
              is created, and below.

              The <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> must be one of:

              <b>STATIC,</b> <b>SHARED,</b> <b>MODULE,</b> <b>UNKNOWN</b>
                     References  a  library  file  located  outside  the  project.  The <u>IMPORTED_LOCATION</u> target
                     property  (or  its  per-configuration  variant  <u>IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>)  specifies  the
                     location of the main library file on disk:

                     • For  a  <b>SHARED</b> library on most non-Windows platforms, the main library file is the <b>.so</b> or
                       <b>.dylib</b> file used by both linkers and dynamic loaders.  If the referenced library file has
                       a <b>SONAME</b> (or on macOS, has a <b>LC_ID_DYLIB</b> starting in <b>@rpath/</b>), the value  of  that  field
                       should  be  set  in  the <u>IMPORTED_SONAME</u> target property.  If the referenced library file
                       does not have a <b>SONAME</b>, but the platform supports it, then  the <u>IMPORTED_NO_SONAME</u> target
                       property should be set.

                     • For  a  <b>SHARED</b>  library  on  Windows,  the  <u>IMPORTED_IMPLIB</u>  target  property   (or   its
                       per-configuration  variant  <u>IMPORTED_IMPLIB_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>)  specifies  the location of the DLL
                       import library file (<b>.lib</b> or <b>.dll.a</b>) on disk, and the <b>IMPORTED_LOCATION</b> is  the  location
                       of  the  <b>.dll</b>  runtime  library  (and  is optional, but needed by the <u>TARGET_RUNTIME_DLLS</u>
                       generator expression).

                     Additional usage requirements may be specified in <b>INTERFACE_*</b> properties.

                     An <b>UNKNOWN</b> library type is typically only used in the implementation of <u>Find</u>  <u>Modules</u>.   It
                     allows the path to an imported library (often found using the <u>find_library()</u> command) to be
                     used  without  having  to  know  what  type of library it is.  This is especially useful on
                     Windows where a static library  and  a  DLL's  import  library  both  have  the  same  file
                     extension.

              <b>OBJECT</b> References  a set of object files located outside the project.  The <u>IMPORTED_OBJECTS</u> target
                     property  (or  its  per-configuration  variant  <u>IMPORTED_OBJECTS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>)  specifies   the
                     locations  of  object  files  on  disk.   Additional usage requirements may be specified in
                     <b>INTERFACE_*</b> properties.

              <b>INTERFACE</b>
                     Does not reference any library or object files on disk, but may specify usage  requirements
                     in <b>INTERFACE_*</b> properties.

              The options are:

              <b>GLOBAL</b> Make the target name globally visible.

       No  rules  are  generated  to build imported targets, and the <u>IMPORTED</u> target property is <b>True</b>.  Imported
       libraries are useful for convenient reference from commands like <u>target_link_libraries()</u>.

       Details about the imported library are specified by setting properties whose names begin in <b>IMPORTED_</b> and
       <b>INTERFACE_</b>.  See documentation of such properties for more information.

   <b>Alias</b> <b>Libraries</b>
       <b>add_library(&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>ALIAS</b> <b>&lt;target&gt;)</b>
              Creates an <u>Alias</u> <u>Target</u>, such that <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> can be used to refer to <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> in subsequent commands.
              The <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> does not appear in the generated buildsystem as a make target.  The <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> may not be
              an <b>ALIAS</b>.

       Added in version 3.11: An <b>ALIAS</b> can target a <b>GLOBAL</b> <u>Imported</u> <u>Target</u>

       Added in version 3.18: An <b>ALIAS</b> can target a non-<b>GLOBAL</b> Imported Target. Such  alias  is  scoped  to  the
       directory in which it is created and below.  The <u>ALIAS_GLOBAL</u> target property can be used to check if the
       alias is global or not.

       <b>ALIAS</b>  targets  can be used as linkable targets and as targets to read properties from.  They can also be
       tested for existence with the regular <u>if(TARGET)</u> subcommand.  The  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>  may  not  be  used  to  modify
       properties   of   <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>,   that   is,   it   may  not  be  used  as  the  operand  of  <u>set_property()</u>,
       <u>set_target_properties()</u>, <u>target_link_libraries()</u> etc.  An <b>ALIAS</b> target may not be installed or exported.

       • <u>add_executable()</u>

   <b>add_link_options</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       Add options to the link step for executable, shared library or module  library  targets  in  the  current
       directory and below that are added after this command is invoked.

          add_link_options(&lt;option&gt; ...)

       This  command  can  be  used  to add any link options, but alternative commands exist to add libraries (‐
       <u>target_link_libraries()</u> or <u>link_libraries()</u>).  See documentation of the <u>directory</u> and <u>target</u> <b>LINK_OPTIONS</b>
       properties.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This command cannot be used to add options for static library targets, since they do not use a linker.
          To add archiver or MSVC librarian flags, see the <u>STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS</u> target property.

       Arguments  to  <b>add_link_options</b>  may  use  generator  expressions  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See   the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>Host</b> <b>And</b> <b>Device</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Options</b>
       Added   in   version   3.18:   When   a   device   link   step   is  involved,  which  is  controlled  by
       <u>CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION</u> and <u>CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS</u> properties and policy <u>CMP0105</u>, the raw options
       will be delivered to the host and device link steps (wrapped  in  <b>-Xcompiler</b>  or  equivalent  for  device
       link). Options wrapped with <u>$&lt;DEVICE_LINK:...&gt;</u> generator expression will be used only for the device link
       step.  Options  wrapped  with  <u>$&lt;HOST_LINK:...&gt;</u>  generator expression will be used only for the host link
       step.

   <b>Option</b> <b>De-duplication</b>
       The final set of options used for a target is constructed by accumulating options from the current target
       and the usage requirements of its dependencies.  The set of options is de-duplicated to avoid repetition.

       Added in version 3.12: While beneficial for individual options, the  de-duplication  step  can  break  up
       option groups.  For example, <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>-option</b> <b>B</b> becomes <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>B</b>.  One may specify a group of options
       using  shell-like  quoting along with a <b>SHELL:</b> prefix.  The <b>SHELL:</b> prefix is dropped, and the rest of the
       option string is parsed using the <u>separate_arguments()</u> <b>UNIX_COMMAND</b> mode. For example, <b>"SHELL:-option</b>  <b>A"</b>
       <b>"SHELL:-option</b> <b>B"</b> becomes <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>-option</b> <b>B</b>.

   <b>Handling</b> <b>Compiler</b> <b>Driver</b> <b>Differences</b>
       To  pass  options  to the linker tool, each compiler driver has its own syntax.  The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix and <b>,</b>
       separator can be used to specify, in a portable way, options to pass  to  the  linker  tool.  <b>LINKER:</b>  is
       replaced  by  the appropriate driver option and <b>,</b> by the appropriate driver separator.  The driver prefix
       and  driver  separator  are  given  by   the   values   of   the   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG</u>   and
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP</u> variables.

       For example, <b>"LINKER:-z,defs"</b> becomes <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>-z</b> <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>defs</b> for <b>Clang</b> and <b>-Wl,-z,defs</b> for <b>GNU</b> <b>GCC</b>.

       The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix can be specified as part of a <b>SHELL:</b> prefix expression.

       The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix supports, as an alternative syntax, specification of arguments using the <b>SHELL:</b> prefix
       and space as separator. The previous example then becomes <b>"LINKER:SHELL:-z</b> <b>defs"</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Specifying  the  <b>SHELL:</b>  prefix  anywhere  other  than  at  the beginning of the <b>LINKER:</b> prefix is not
          supported.

         the compiler.  This includes invocations that drive compiling and those that drive linking.

   <b>add_subdirectory</b>
       Add a subdirectory to the build.

          add_subdirectory(source_dir [binary_dir] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [SYSTEM])

       Adds a subdirectory  to  the  build.   The  <b>source_dir</b>  specifies  the  directory  in  which  the  source
       <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>  and  code files are located.  If it is a relative path, it will be evaluated with respect
       to the current directory (the typical usage), but it may  also  be  an  absolute  path.   The  <b>binary_dir</b>
       specifies  the  directory  in  which  to  place  the  output files.  If it is a relative path, it will be
       evaluated with respect to the current output directory,  but  it  may  also  be  an  absolute  path.   If
       <b>binary_dir</b>  is  not  specified, the value of <b>source_dir</b>, before expanding any relative path, will be used
       (the typical usage).  The <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file  in  the  specified  source  directory  will  be  processed
       immediately by CMake before processing in the current input file continues beyond this command.

       If  the <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b> argument is provided then the <u>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</u> property will be set on the added
       directory.   This  will  exclude  the  directory  from  a  default  build.  See  the  directory  property
       <u>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</u> for full details.

       Added  in  version  3.25:  If  the  <b>SYSTEM</b>  argument  is  provided,  the <u>SYSTEM</u> directory property of the
       subdirectory will be set to true.  This property is used  to  initialize  the  <u>SYSTEM</u>  property  of  each
       non-imported target created in that subdirectory.

   <b>add_test</b>
       Add a test to the project to be run by <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u>.

          add_test(NAME &lt;name&gt; COMMAND &lt;command&gt; [&lt;arg&gt;...]
                   [CONFIGURATIONS &lt;config&gt;...]
                   [WORKING_DIRECTORY &lt;dir&gt;]
                   [COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS])

       Adds  a  test  called  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>.   The  test  name  may contain arbitrary characters, expressed as a <u>Quoted</u>
       <u>Argument</u> or <u>Bracket</u> <u>Argument</u> if necessary.  See policy <u>CMP0110</u>.

       CMake only generates tests if the <u>enable_testing()</u> command has been invoked.  The  <u>CTest</u>  module  invokes
       <b>enable_testing</b> automatically unless <b>BUILD_TESTING</b> is set to <b>OFF</b>.

       Tests  added with the <b>add_test(NAME)</b> signature support using <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> in test properties set
       by <u>set_property(TEST)</u> or <u>set_tests_properties()</u>. Test properties may only be set  in  the  directory  the
       test is created in.

       <b>add_test</b> options are:

       <b>COMMAND</b>
              Specify the test command-line.

              If <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> specifies an executable target created by <u>add_executable()</u>:

              • It will automatically be replaced by the location of the executable created at build time.

              • Added  in  version  3.3:  The  target's <u>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u>, if set, will be used to run the
                command on the host:

                   &lt;emulator&gt; &lt;command&gt;

                Changed in version 3.29: The emulator is used only when <u>cross-compiling</u>.  See policy <u>CMP0158</u>.

              • Added in version 3.29: The target's <u>TEST_LAUNCHER</u>, if set, will be used to launch the command:

                   &lt;launcher&gt; &lt;command&gt;

                If the <u>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u> is also set, both are used:

                   &lt;launcher&gt; &lt;emulator&gt; &lt;command&gt;

              The command may be specified using <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       <b>CONFIGURATIONS</b>
              Restrict execution of the test only to the named configurations.

       <b>WORKING_DIRECTORY</b>
              Set the test property <u>WORKING_DIRECTORY</u> in which to execute the test. If not specified,  the  test
              will  be  run  in <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u>. The working directory may be specified using <u>generator</u>
              <u>expressions</u>.

       <b>COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS</b>
              Added in version 3.16.

              Lists in <b>COMMAND</b> arguments will be expanded, including those created with <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       If the test command exits with code <b>0</b> the test passes. Non-zero exit code is a "failed"  test.  The  test
       property  <u>WILL_FAIL</u>  inverts this logic. Note that system-level test failures such as segmentation faults
       or heap errors will still fail the test even if <b>WILL_FAIL</b> is true. Output written to stdout or stderr  is
       captured   by   <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u>   and  only  affects  the  pass/fail  status  via  the  <u>PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</u>,
       <u>FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</u>, or <u>SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</u> test properties.

       Added in version 3.16: Added <u>SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</u> property.

       Example usage:

          add_test(NAME mytest
                   COMMAND testDriver --config $&lt;CONFIG&gt;
                                      --exe $&lt;TARGET_FILE:myexe&gt;)

       This creates a test <b>mytest</b> whose command runs a <b>testDriver</b> tool passing the configuration  name  and  the
       full path to the executable file produced by target <b>myexe</b>.

                                                         ----

       The command syntax above is recommended over the older, less flexible form:

          add_test(&lt;name&gt; &lt;command&gt; [&lt;arg&gt;...])

       Add a test called <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> with the given command-line.

       Unlike  the above <b>NAME</b> signature, target names are not supported in the command-line.  Furthermore, tests
       added with this signature do not support <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> in the command-line or test properties.

   <b>aux_source_directory</b>
       Find all source files in a directory.

          aux_source_directory(&lt;dir&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)

       Collects the names of all the source files in  the  specified  directory  and  stores  the  list  in  the
       <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>  provided.   This  command  is  intended  to  be  used  by projects that use explicit template
       instantiation.  Template instantiation files can be stored in  a  <b>Templates</b>  subdirectory  and  collected
       automatically using this command to avoid manually listing all instantiations.

       It  is tempting to use this command to avoid writing the list of source files for a library or executable
       target.  While this seems to work, there is no way for CMake to generate a build system that knows when a
       new source file has been added.  Normally the generated build system knows when it needs to  rerun  CMake
       because  the  <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>  file is modified to add a new source.  When the source is just added to the
       directory without modifying this file, one would have to manually rerun CMake to generate a build  system
       incorporating the new file.

   <b>build_command</b>
       Get  a  command line to build the current project.  This is mainly intended for internal use by the <u>CTest</u>
       module.

          build_command(&lt;variable&gt;
                        [CONFIGURATION &lt;config&gt;]
                        [PARALLEL_LEVEL &lt;parallel&gt;]
                        [TARGET &lt;target&gt;]
                        [PROJECT_NAME &lt;projname&gt;] # legacy, causes warning
                       )

       Sets the given <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> to a command-line string of the form:

          &lt;cmake&gt; --build . [--config &lt;config&gt;] [--parallel &lt;parallel&gt;] [--target &lt;target&gt;...] [-- -i]

       where <b>&lt;cmake&gt;</b> is the location of the <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u> command-line tool, and <b>&lt;config&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;parallel&gt;</b>  and  <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>
       are the values provided to the <b>CONFIGURATION</b>, <b>PARALLEL_LEVEL</b> and <b>TARGET</b> options, if any.  The trailing <b>--</b>
       <b>-i</b> option is added for <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> if policy <u>CMP0061</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b>.

       When invoked, this <u>cmake</u> <u>--build</u> command line will launch the underlying build system tool.

       Added in version 3.21: The <b>PARALLEL_LEVEL</b> argument can be used to set the <u>--parallel</u> flag.

          build_command(&lt;cachevariable&gt; &lt;makecommand&gt;)

       This  second  signature  is  deprecated,  but still available for backwards compatibility.  Use the first
       signature instead.

       It sets the given <b>&lt;cachevariable&gt;</b> to a command-line string as above but without the <u>--target</u> option.  The
       <b>&lt;makecommand&gt;</b> is ignored but should be the full path to devenv, nmake, make or one of the end user  build
       tools for legacy invocations.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          In  CMake  versions prior to 3.0 this command returned a command line that directly invokes the native
          build tool for the current generator.  Their implementation of the <b>PROJECT_NAME</b> option had  no  useful
          effects, so CMake now warns on use of the option.

   <b>cmake_file_api</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       Enables interacting with the <u>CMake</u> <u>file</u> <u>API</u>.

       <b>cmake_file_api(QUERY</b> <b>...)</b>
              The <b>QUERY</b> subcommand adds a file API query for the current CMake invocation.

                 cmake_file_api(
                   QUERY
                   API_VERSION &lt;version&gt;
                   [CODEMODEL &lt;versions&gt;...]
                   [CACHE &lt;versions&gt;...]
                   [CMAKEFILES &lt;versions&gt;...]
                   [TOOLCHAINS &lt;versions&gt;...]
                 )

              The  <b>API_VERSION</b>  must  always  be given.  Currently, the only supported value for <b>&lt;version&gt;</b> is 1.
              See <u>API</u> <u>v1</u> for details of the reply content and location.

              Each of the optional keywords <b>CODEMODEL</b>, <b>CACHE</b>, <b>CMAKEFILES</b> and <b>TOOLCHAINS</b> correspond to one of the
              object kinds that can be requested by the project.  The <b>configureLog</b> object  kind  cannot  be  set
              with  this  command, since it must be set before CMake starts reading the top level <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>
              file.

              For each of the optional keywords, the <b>&lt;versions&gt;</b> list must contain one or more version values  of
              the  form  <b>major</b>  or  <b>major.minor</b>,  where  <b>major</b> and <b>minor</b> are integers.  Projects should list the
              versions they accept in their preferred order, as only the first supported  value  from  the  list
              will  be  selected.   The  command will ignore versions with a <b>major</b> version higher than any major
              version it supports for that object kind.  It will raise an error  if  it  encounters  an  invalid
              version number, or if none of the requested versions is supported.

              For  each  type  of object kind requested, a query equivalent to a shared, stateless query will be
              added internally.  No query file will be created in the file system.  The reply <u>will</u> be written to
              the file system at generation time.

              It is not an error to add a query for the same thing more than once, whether from query  files  or
              from  multiple  calls  to  <b>cmake_file_api(QUERY)</b>.   The  final  set  of  queries  will be a merged
              combination of all queries specified on disk and queries submitted by the project.

   <b>Example</b>
       A project may want to use replies from the file API at build time to implement some form of  verification
       task.   Instead  of  relying  on  something  outside of CMake to create a query file, the project can use
       <b>cmake_file_api(QUERY)</b> to request the required information for the current run.   It  can  then  create  a
       custom command to run at build time, knowing that the requested information should always be available.

          cmake_file_api(
            QUERY
            API_VERSION 1
            CODEMODEL 2.3
            TOOLCHAINS 1
          )

          add_custom_target(verify_project
            COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND}
              -D BUILD_DIR=${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}
              -D CONFIG=$&lt;CONFIG&gt;
              -P ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/verify_project.cmake
          )

   <b>create_test_sourcelist</b>
       Create  a  test  driver  program  that links together many small tests into a single executable.  This is
       useful when building static executables with large libraries to shrink the total required size.

       <b>create_test_sourcelist(&lt;sourceListName&gt;</b> <b>&lt;driverName&gt;</b> <b>&lt;test&gt;...</b> <b>&lt;options&gt;...)</b>
              Generate a test driver source file from a list of individual test sources and provide  a  combined
              list of sources that can be built as an executable.

              The options are:

              <b>&lt;sourceListName&gt;</b>
                     The  name of a variable in which to store the list of source files needed to build the test
                     driver.  The list will contain the <b>&lt;test&gt;...</b> sources and the generated <b>&lt;driverName&gt;</b> source.

                     Changed in version 3.29: The test driver source is listed by absolute  path  in  the  build
                     tree.  Previously it was listed only as <b>&lt;driverName&gt;</b>.

              <b>&lt;driverName&gt;</b>
                     Name  of  the test driver source file to be generated into the build tree.  The source file
                     will contain a <b>main()</b> program entry point that dispatches to whatever test is named on  the
                     command line.

              <b>&lt;test&gt;...</b>
                     Test  source  files  to  be  added to the driver binary.  Each test source file must have a
                     function in it that is the same name as the file with the extension removed.  For  example,
                     a <b>foo.cxx</b> test source might contain:

                        int foo(int argc, char** argv)

              <b>EXTRA_INCLUDE</b> <b>&lt;header&gt;</b>
                     Specify a header file to <b>#include</b> in the generated test driver source.

              <b>FUNCTION</b> <b>&lt;function&gt;</b>
                     Specify  a  function  to  be  called  with  pointers to <b>argc</b> and <b>argv</b>.  The function may be
                     provided in the <b>EXTRA_INCLUDE</b> header:

                        void function(int* pargc, char*** pargv)

                     This can be used to add extra command line processing to each test.

       Additionally, some CMake variables affect test driver generation:

       <b>CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_BEFORE_TESTMAIN</b>
              Code to be placed directly before calling each test's function.

       <b>CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_AFTER_TESTMAIN</b>
              Code to be placed directly after the call to each test's function.

   <b>define_property</b>
       Define and document custom properties.

          define_property(&lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY | TARGET | SOURCE |
                           TEST | VARIABLE | CACHED_VARIABLE&gt;
                           PROPERTY &lt;name&gt; [INHERITED]

                           [INITIALIZE_FROM_VARIABLE &lt;variable&gt;])

       Defines one property in a scope for use with the <u>set_property()</u> and <u>get_property()</u> commands. It is mainly
       useful for defining the way a property is  initialized  or  inherited.  Historically,  the  command  also
       associated documentation with a property, but that is no longer considered a primary use case.

       The  first argument determines the kind of scope in which the property should be used.  It must be one of
       the following:

          GLOBAL    = associated with the global namespace
          DIRECTORY = associated with one directory
          TARGET    = associated with one target
          SOURCE    = associated with one source file
          TEST      = associated with a test named with add_test
          VARIABLE  = documents a CMake language variable
          CACHED_VARIABLE = documents a CMake cache variable

       Note that unlike <u>set_property()</u> and <u>get_property()</u> no actual scope needs to be given; only  the  kind  of
       scope is important.

       The required <b>PROPERTY</b> option is immediately followed by the name of the property being defined.

       If  the <b>INHERITED</b> option is given, then the <u>get_property()</u> command will chain up to the next higher scope
       when the requested property is not set in the scope given to the command.

       • <b>DIRECTORY</b> scope chains to its parent directory's scope, continuing the walk up parent directories until
         a directory has the property set or there are no more parents.  If still not found  at  the  top  level
         directory, it chains to the <b>GLOBAL</b> scope.

       • <b>TARGET</b>,  <b>SOURCE</b>  and  <b>TEST</b>  properties  chain  to  <b>DIRECTORY</b>  scope,  including further chaining up the
         directories, etc. as needed.

       Note that this scope chaining behavior only applies to calls to <u>get_property()</u>, <u>get_directory_property()</u>,
       <u>get_target_property()</u>,  <u>get_source_file_property()</u>  and  <u>get_test_property()</u>.   There  is  no  inheriting
       behavior  when  <u>setting</u> properties, so using <b>APPEND</b> or <b>APPEND_STRING</b> with the <u>set_property()</u> command will
       not consider inherited values when working out the contents to append to.

       The <b>BRIEF_DOCS</b> and <b>FULL_DOCS</b> options are followed by strings to be associated with the  property  as  its
       brief  and  full  documentation.  CMake does not use this documentation other than making it available to
       the project via corresponding options to the <u>get_property()</u> command.

       Changed in version 3.23: The <b>BRIEF_DOCS</b> and <b>FULL_DOCS</b> options are optional.

       Added in version 3.23: The <b>INITIALIZE_FROM_VARIABLE</b> option specifies a variable from which  the  property
       should be initialized. It can only be used with target properties.  The <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> name must end with the
       property  name  and  must  not  begin with <b>CMAKE_</b> or <b>_CMAKE_</b>. The property name must contain at least one
       underscore. It is recommended that the property name have a prefix specific to the project.

   <b>Property</b> <b>Redefinition</b>
       Once a property is defined for a particular type of scope, it cannot be redefined. Attempts  to  redefine
       an  existing  property  by  calling  <u>define_property()</u> with the same scope type and property name will be
       silently ignored. Defining the same property name for two different kinds of scope is valid.

       <u>get_property()</u> can be used to determine whether a property is already defined for a  particular  kind  of
       scope, and if so, to examine its definition. For example:

          # Initial definition
          define_property(TARGET PROPERTY MY_NEW_PROP
            BRIEF_DOCS "My new custom property"
          )

          # Later examination
          get_property(my_new_prop_exists
            TARGET NONE
            PROPERTY MY_NEW_PROP
            DEFINED
          )

          <a href="../manmy_new_prop_exists/if.my_new_prop_exists.html">if</a>(my_new_prop_exists)
            get_property(my_new_prop_docs
              TARGET NONE
              PROPERTY MY_NEW_PROP
              BRIEF_DOCS
            )
            # ${my_new_prop_docs} is now set to "My new custom property"
          endif()

       • <u>set_property()</u>

   <b>enable_language</b>
       Enable languages (CXX/C/OBJC/OBJCXX/Fortran/etc)

          enable_language(&lt;lang&gt;... [OPTIONAL])

       Enables support for the named languages in CMake.  This is the same as the <u>project()</u> command but does not
       create any of the extra variables that are created by the <u>project()</u> command.

       Supported  languages  are  <b>C</b>,  <b>CXX</b>  (i.e.  C++), <b>CSharp</b> (i.e.  C#), <b>CUDA</b>, <b>OBJC</b> (i.e. Objective-C), <b>OBJCXX</b>
       (i.e. Objective-C++), <b>Fortran</b>, <b>HIP</b>, <b>ISPC</b>, <b>Swift</b>, <b>ASM</b>, <b>ASM_NASM</b>, <b>ASM_MARMASM</b>, <b>ASM_MASM</b>, and <b>ASM-ATT</b>.
          Added in version 3.8: Added <b>CSharp</b> and <b>CUDA</b> support.

          Added in version 3.15: Added <b>Swift</b> support.

          Added in version 3.16: Added <b>OBJC</b> and <b>OBJCXX</b> support.

          Added in version 3.18: Added <b>ISPC</b> support.

          Added in version 3.21: Added <b>HIP</b> support.

          Added in version 3.26: Added <b>ASM_MARMASM</b> support.

       If enabling <b>ASM</b>, list it last so that CMake can check whether compilers for other languages like  <b>C</b>  work
       for assembly too.

       The following restrictions apply to where <b>enable_language()</b> may be called:

       • It must be called in file scope, not in a function call.

       • It must not be called before the first call to <u>project()</u>.  See policy <u>CMP0165</u>.

       • It  must be called in the highest directory common to all targets using the named language directly for
         compiling sources or indirectly through link  dependencies.   It  is  simplest  to  enable  all  needed
         languages in the top-level directory of a project.

       The  <b>OPTIONAL</b> keyword is a placeholder for future implementation and does not currently work. Instead you
       can use the <u>CheckLanguage</u> module to verify support before enabling.

   <b>enable_testing</b>
       Enable testing for current directory and below.

          enable_testing()

       Enables testing for this directory and below.

       This command should be in the source directory root because ctest expects to find  a  test  file  in  the
       build directory root.

       This  command  is  automatically  invoked  when the <u>CTest</u> module is included, except if the <b>BUILD_TESTING</b>
       option is turned off.

       See also the <u>add_test()</u> command.

   <b>export</b>
       Export targets or packages for outside projects to use them directly from  the  current  project's  build
       tree, without installation.

       See the <u>install(EXPORT)</u> command to export targets from an install tree.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
          export(<u>TARGETS</u> &lt;target&gt;... [...])
          export(<u>EXPORT</u> &lt;export-name&gt; [...])
          export(<u>PACKAGE</u> &lt;PackageName&gt;)
          export(<u>SETUP</u> &lt;export-name&gt; [...])

   <b>Exporting</b> <b>Targets</b>
       <b>export(TARGETS</b> <b>&lt;target&gt;...</b> <b>[...])</b>

          export(TARGETS &lt;target&gt;... [NAMESPACE &lt;namespace&gt;]
                 [APPEND] FILE &lt;filename&gt; [EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES]
                 [CXX_MODULES_DIRECTORY &lt;directory&gt;])

       Creates a file <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> that may be included by outside projects to import targets named by <b>&lt;target&gt;...</b>
       from  the  current  project's  build  tree.   This  is  useful  during  cross-compiling  to build utility
       executables that can run on the host platform in one project and then import them  into  another  project
       being compiled for the target platform.

       The  file  created  by this command is specific to the build tree and should never be installed.  See the
       <u>install(EXPORT)</u> command to export targets from an install tree.

       The options are:

       <b>NAMESPACE</b> <b>&lt;namespace&gt;</b>
              Prepend the <b>&lt;namespace&gt;</b> string to all target names written to the file.

       <b>APPEND</b> Append to the file instead of overwriting it.  This can be used to incrementally  export  multiple
              targets to the same file.

       <b>EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</b>
              Include      the     contents     of     the     properties     named     with     the     pattern
              <b>(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)?</b>  in the export, even when policy <u>CMP0022</u> is  NEW.
              This is useful to support consumers using CMake versions older than 2.8.12.

       <b>CXX_MODULES_DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.28.

              Export C++ module properties to files under the given directory. Each file will be named according
              to  the  target's export name (without any namespace).  These files will automatically be included
              from the export file.

       This signature requires all targets to be listed explicitly.  If a library  target  is  included  in  the
       export,  but  a  target  to  which  it  links  is  not  included,  the  behavior is unspecified.  See the
       <u>export(EXPORT)</u> signature to automatically export the same targets from the build tree as  <u>install(EXPORT)</u>
       would from an install tree.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          <u>Object</u>  <u>Libraries</u>  under  <u>Xcode</u>  have  special  handling  if  multiple  architectures  are  listed  in
          <u>CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES</u>.  In this case they will be exported as <u>Interface</u>  <u>Libraries</u>  with  no  object
          files  available  to  clients.   This  is sufficient to satisfy transitive usage requirements of other
          targets that link to the object libraries in their implementation.

       This   command   exports   all    <u>Build</u>    <u>Configurations</u>    from    the    build    tree.     See    the
       <u>CMAKE_MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>  variable  to map configurations of dependent projects to the exported
       configurations.

   <b>Exporting</b> <b>Targets</b> <b>to</b> <b>Android.mk</b>
          export(TARGETS &lt;target&gt;... ANDROID_MK &lt;filename&gt;)

       Added in version 3.7.

       This signature exports cmake built targets to the android ndk build system by creating an <b>Android.mk</b> file
       that references the prebuilt targets. The Android NDK supports the use of prebuilt libraries, both static
       and shared.  This allows cmake to build the libraries of a project and make  them  available  to  an  ndk
       build  system  complete  with  transitive  dependencies,  include  flags  and defines required to use the
       libraries. The signature takes a list of targets and puts them in the <b>Android.mk</b> file  specified  by  the
       <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> given. This signature can only be used if policy <u>CMP0022</u> is NEW for all targets given. A error
       will be issued if that policy is set to OLD for one of the targets.

   <b>Exporting</b> <b>Targets</b> <b>matching</b> <b>install(EXPORT)</b>
       <b>export(EXPORT</b> <b>&lt;export-name&gt;</b> <b>[...])</b>

          export(EXPORT &lt;export-name&gt; [NAMESPACE &lt;namespace&gt;] [FILE &lt;filename&gt;]
                 [CXX_MODULES_DIRECTORY &lt;directory&gt;] [EXPORT_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES])

       Creates  a  file  <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>  that may be included by outside projects to import targets from the current
       project's build tree.  This is the same as the <u>export(TARGETS)</u> signature, except that the targets are not
       explicitly  listed.   Instead,  it  exports  the  targets  associated  with   the   installation   export
       <b>&lt;export-name&gt;</b>.   Target  installations  may  be associated with the export <b>&lt;export-name&gt;</b> using the <b>EXPORT</b>
       option of the <u>install(TARGETS)</u> command.

       <b>EXPORT_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Experimental. Gated by <b>CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_EXPORT_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES</b>.

              Specify that <u>find_dependency()</u> calls should be exported. See <u>install(EXPORT)</u> for  details  on  how
              this works.

   <b>Exporting</b> <b>Packages</b>
       <b>export(PACKAGE</b> <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;)</b>

          export(PACKAGE &lt;PackageName&gt;)

       Store  the  current  build  directory  in the CMake user package registry for package <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b>.  The
       <u>find_package()</u> command may consider the directory while searching for package <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b>.  This  helps
       dependent  projects  find  and  use a package from the current project's build tree without help from the
       user.  Note that the entry in the package registry that this command creates works  only  in  conjunction
       with  a  package  configuration  file (<b>&lt;PackageName&gt;Config.cmake</b>) that works with the build tree. In some
       cases, for example for packaging and for system wide installations, it is not desirable to write the user
       package registry.

       Changed in version 3.1: If the <u>CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u> variable is enabled, the  <b>export(PACKAGE)</b>
       command will do nothing.

       Changed in version 3.15: By default the <b>export(PACKAGE)</b> command does nothing (see policy <u>CMP0090</u>) because
       populating  the  user  package  registry  has  effects  outside  the  source  and  build  trees.  Set the
       <u>CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u> variable to add build directories to the CMake user package registry.

   <b>Configuring</b> <b>Exports</b>
       <b>export(SETUP</b> <b>&lt;export-name&gt;</b> <b>[...])</b>

          export(SETUP &lt;export-name&gt;
                 [PACKAGE_DEPENDENCY &lt;dep&gt;
                  [ENABLED (&lt;bool-true&gt;|&lt;bool-false&gt;|AUTO)]
                  [EXTRA_ARGS &lt;args&gt;...]
                 ] [...]
                 [TARGET &lt;target&gt;
                  [XCFRAMEWORK_LOCATION &lt;location&gt;]
                 ] [...]
                 )

       Added in version 3.29.

       Configure the parameters of an export. The arguments are as follows:

       <b>PACKAGE_DEPENDENCY</b> <b>&lt;dep&gt;</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Experimental. Gated by <b>CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_EXPORT_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES</b>.

              Specify a package dependency to configure. This changes how <u>find_dependency()</u>  calls  are  written
              during <u>export(EXPORT)</u> and <u>install(EXPORT)</u>. <b>&lt;dep&gt;</b> is the name of a package to export. This argument
              accepts the following additional arguments:

              <b>ENABLED</b>
                     Manually  control  whether  or  not  the dependency is exported. This accepts the following
                     values:

                     <b>&lt;bool-true&gt;</b>
                            Any value that CMake recognizes as "true". Always export the dependency, even if  no
                            exported  targets  depend  on it. This can be used to manually add <u>find_dependency()</u>
                            calls to the export.

                     <b>&lt;bool-false&gt;</b>
                            Any value that CMake recognizes as "false". Never export the dependency, even if  an
                            exported target depends on it.

                     <b>AUTO</b>   Only export the dependency if an exported target depends on it.

              <b>EXTRA_ARGS</b> <b>&lt;args&gt;</b>
                     Specify additional arguments to pass to <u>find_dependency()</u> after the <b>REQUIRED</b> argument.

       <b>TARGET</b> <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>
              Specify  a  target  to  configure  in  this export. This argument accepts the following additional
              arguments:

              <b>XCFRAMEWORK_LOCATION</b>
                     Specify the location of an <b>.xcframework</b> which contains the library  from  this  target.  If
                     specified, the generated code will check to see if the <b>.xcframework</b> exists, and if it does,
                     it will use the <b>.xcframework</b> as its imported location instead of the installed library.

   <b>fltk_wrap_ui</b>
       Create FLTK user interfaces Wrappers.

          fltk_wrap_ui(resultingLibraryName source1
                       source2 ... sourceN )

       Produce .h and .cxx files for all the .fl and .fld files listed.  The resulting .h and .cxx files will be
       added to a variable named <b>resultingLibraryName_FLTK_UI_SRCS</b> which should be added to your library.

   <b>get_source_file_property</b>
       Get a property for a source file.

          get_source_file_property(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;file&gt;
                                   [DIRECTORY &lt;dir&gt; | TARGET_DIRECTORY &lt;target&gt;]
                                   &lt;property&gt;)

       Gets a property from a source file.  The value of the property is stored in the specified <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.  If
       the <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> is not a source file, or the source property is not found, <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> will be set to <b>NOTFOUND</b>.
       If  the  source property was defined to be an <b>INHERITED</b> property (see <u>define_property()</u>), the search will
       include the relevant parent scopes, as described for the <u>define_property()</u> command.

       By default, the source file's property will be read from the current source directory's scope.

       Added in version 3.18: Directory scope can be overridden with one of the following sub-options:

       <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              The source file property will be read from the <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> directory's scope.  CMake must  already  know
              about  that  source  directory,  either by having added it through a call to <u>add_subdirectory()</u> or
              <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> being the top level source directory.  Relative paths are treated as relative to the current
              source directory.

       <b>TARGET_DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>
              The source file property will be read from the directory  scope  in  which  <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>  was  created
              (<b>&lt;target&gt;</b> must therefore already exist).

       Use <u>set_source_files_properties()</u> to set property values.  Source file properties usually control how the
       file is built. One property that is always there is <u>LOCATION</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The <u>GENERATED</u> source file property may be globally visible.  See its documentation for details.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • <u>define_property()</u>

       • the more general <u>get_property()</u> command

       • <u>set_source_files_properties()</u>

   <b>get_target_property</b>
       Get a property from a target.

          get_target_property(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;target&gt; &lt;property&gt;)

       Get  a  property from a target.  The value of the property is stored in the specified <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.  If the
       target property is not found, <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> will be set to <b>&lt;variable&gt;-NOTFOUND</b>.  If the target property  was
       defined  to be an <b>INHERITED</b> property (see <u>define_property()</u>), the search will include the relevant parent
       scopes, as described for the <u>define_property()</u> command.

       Use <u>set_target_properties()</u> to set target property values.  Properties are usually used to control how  a
       target  is  built,  but some query the target instead.  This command can get properties for any target so
       far created.  The targets do not need to be in the current <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>

       • <u>set_target_properties()</u>

       • <u>Properties</u> <u>on</u> <u>Targets</u> for the list of properties known to CMake

   <b>get_test_property</b>
       Get a property of the test.

          get_test_property(&lt;test&gt; &lt;property&gt; [DIRECTORY &lt;dir&gt;] &lt;variable&gt;)

       Get a property from the test.  The value of the property is stored in the specified <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.   If  the
       <b>&lt;test&gt;</b>  is  not  defined,  or the test property is not found, <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> will be set to <b>NOTFOUND</b>.  If the
       test property was defined to be an <b>INHERITED</b> property (see <u>define_property()</u>), the  search  will  include
       the relevant parent scopes, as described for the <u>define_property()</u> command.

       For a list of standard properties you can type <u>cmake</u> <u>--help-property-list</u>.

       Added in version 3.28: Directory scope can be overridden with the following sub-option:

       <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              The  test  property  will be read from the <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> directory's scope.  CMake must already know about
              that source directory, either by having added it through a call  to  <u>add_subdirectory()</u>  or  <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              being  the  top  level  source  directory.   Relative paths are treated as relative to the current
              source directory. <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> may reference a binary directory.

       • <u>define_property()</u>

       • the more general <u>get_property()</u> command

   <b>include_directories</b>
       Add include directories to the build.

          include_directories([AFTER|BEFORE] [SYSTEM] dir1 [dir2 ...])

       Add the given directories to those the compiler uses to search for include  files.   Relative  paths  are
       interpreted as relative to the current source directory.

       The  include  directories  are  added  to  the  <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>  directory  property  for the current
       <b>CMakeLists</b> file.  They are also added to the <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> target property for each target  in  the
       current <b>CMakeLists</b> file.  The target property values are the ones used by the generators.

       By  default  the  directories  specified are appended onto the current list of directories.  This default
       behavior can be changed by setting <u>CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE</u> to <b>ON</b>.   By  using  <b>AFTER</b>  or  <b>BEFORE</b>
       explicitly, you can select between appending and prepending, independent of the default.

       If  the  <b>SYSTEM</b>  option  is  given, the compiler will be told the directories are meant as system include
       directories on some platforms.  Signaling this  setting  might  achieve  effects  such  as  the  compiler
       skipping  warnings, or these fixed-install system files not being considered in dependency calculations -
       see compiler docs.

       Arguments to  <b>include_directories</b>  may  use  generator  expressions  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See  the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Prefer  the  <u>target_include_directories()</u> command to add include directories to individual targets and
          optionally propagate/export them to dependents.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • <u>target_include_directories()</u>

   <b>include_external_msproject</b>
       Include an external Microsoft project file in the solution file produced  by  <u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u>.
       Ignored on other generators.

          include_external_msproject(projectname location
                                     [TYPE projectTypeGUID]
                                     [GUID projectGUID]
                                     [PLATFORM platformName]
                                     dep1 dep2 ...)

       Includes  an  external Microsoft project in the generated solution file.  This will create a target named
       <b>[projectname]</b>.  This can be used in the <u>add_dependencies()</u> command to make things depend on the  external
       project.

       <b>TYPE</b>,  <b>GUID</b> and <b>PLATFORM</b> are optional parameters that allow one to specify the type of project, id (<b>GUID</b>)
       of the project and the name of the target platform.  This is useful for projects requiring  values  other
       than the default (e.g.  WIX projects).

       Added in version 3.9: If the imported project has different configuration names than the current project,
       set the <u>MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> target property to specify the mapping.

   <b>include_regular_expression</b>
       Set the regular expression used for dependency checking.

          include_regular_expression(regex_match [regex_complain])

       Sets the regular expressions used in dependency checking.  Only files matching <b>regex_match</b> will be traced
       as  dependencies.   Only  files  matching  <b>regex_complain</b>  will generate warnings if they cannot be found
       (standard header paths are not searched).  The defaults are:

          regex_match    = "^.*$" (match everything)
          regex_complain = "^$" (match empty string only)

   <b>install</b>
       Specify rules to run at install time.

   <b>Introduction</b>
       This command generates installation rules for a  project.   Install  rules  specified  by  calls  to  the
       <b>install()</b> command within a source directory are executed in order during installation.

       Changed in version 3.14: Install rules in subdirectories added by calls to the <u>add_subdirectory()</u> command
       are interleaved with those in the parent directory to run in the order declared (see policy <u>CMP0082</u>).

       Changed  in  version  3.22:  The environment variable <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE</u> can override the default copying
       behavior of <b>install()</b>.

       Changed in version 3.31: Projects can enable <u>INSTALL_PARALLEL</u> to enable  a  parallel  installation.  When
       using the parallel install, subdirectories added by calls to the <u>add_subdirectory()</u> command are installed
       independently  and  the  order  that  install  rules  added  in  different subdirectories will run is not
       guaranteed.

       There are multiple signatures for this command.  Some of them define installation options for  files  and
       targets.   Options  common to multiple signatures are covered here but they are valid only for signatures
       that specify them.  The common options are:

       <b>DESTINATION</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Specify the directory on disk to which a file will be installed.  <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> should be a relative path.
              An absolute path is allowed, but not recommended.

              When a relative path is given, it is interpreted relative to the value of the <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>
              variable.  The prefix can be relocated at install time using the <b>DESTDIR</b>  mechanism  explained  in
              the <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> variable documentation.

              As  absolute  paths  do  not  work with the <b>cmake</b> <b>--install</b> command's <u>--prefix</u> option, or with the
              <u>cpack</u> installer generators, it is strongly recommended to use relative paths throughout  for  best
              support  by  package  maintainers.   In  particular,  there  is  no need to make paths absolute by
              prepending <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>; this prefix is used by default if the DESTINATION is  a  relative
              path.

              If an absolute path (with a leading slash or drive letter) is given it is used verbatim.

              Changed in version 3.31: <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> will be normalized according to the same <u>normalization</u> <u>rules</u> as the
              <u>cmake_path()</u> command.

       <b>PERMISSIONS</b> <b>&lt;permission&gt;...</b>
              Specify   permissions  for  installed  files.   Valid  permissions  are  <b>OWNER_READ</b>,  <b>OWNER_WRITE</b>,
              <b>OWNER_EXECUTE</b>, <b>GROUP_READ</b>, <b>GROUP_WRITE</b>,  <b>GROUP_EXECUTE</b>,  <b>WORLD_READ</b>,  <b>WORLD_WRITE</b>,  <b>WORLD_EXECUTE</b>,
              <b>SETUID</b>,  and <b>SETGID</b>.  Permissions that do not make sense on certain platforms are ignored on those
              platforms.

              If this option is used multiple times in a single call, its list of permissions  accumulates.   If
              an  <u>install(TARGETS)</u>  call  uses  <u>&lt;artifact-kind&gt;</u>  arguments,  a  separate  list of permissions is
              accumulated for each kind of artifact.

       <b>CONFIGURATIONS</b> <b>&lt;config&gt;...</b>
              Specify a list of build configurations for which the install rule applies (Debug, Release, etc.).

              If this option is used multiple times in a single call, its list  of  configurations  accumulates.
              If  an  <u>install(TARGETS)</u> call uses <u>&lt;artifact-kind&gt;</u> arguments, a separate list of configurations is
              accumulated for each kind of artifact.

       <b>COMPONENT</b> <b>&lt;component&gt;</b>
              Specify an installation component name with which the install rule is associated, such as  <b>Runtime</b>
              or  <b>Development</b>.   During  component-specific  installation only install rules associated with the
              given component name will be executed.  During a full installation all  components  are  installed
              unless   marked  with  <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b>.   If  <b>COMPONENT</b>  is  not  provided  a  default  component
              "Unspecified"  is  created.   The  default   component   name   may   be   controlled   with   the
              <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME</u> variable.

       <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b>
              Added in version 3.6.

              Specify  that  the  file  is  excluded  from  a  full installation and only installed as part of a
              component-specific installation

       <b>OPTIONAL</b>
              Specify that it is not an error if the file to be installed does not exist.

       Added in version 3.1: Command signatures that install files may print messages during installation.   Use
       the <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE</u> variable to control which messages are printed.

       Added  in  version  3.11: Many of the <b>install()</b> variants implicitly create the directories containing the
       installed files. If <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS</u> is set, these directories will be created
       with the permissions specified. Otherwise, they will be created according to the uname rules on Unix-like
       platforms.  Windows platforms are unaffected.

   <b>Signatures</b>
       <b>install(TARGETS</b> <b>&lt;target&gt;...</b> <b>[...])</b>
              Install target <u>Output</u> <u>Artifacts</u> and associated files:

                         [INCLUDES DESTINATION [&lt;dir&gt; ...]]
                         )

              where <b>&lt;artifact-option&gt;...</b> group may contain:

                 [DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;]
                 [PERMISSIONS &lt;permission&gt;...]

                 [OPTIONAL] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
                 [NAMELINK_ONLY|NAMELINK_SKIP]

              The first <b>&lt;artifact-option&gt;...</b> group applies to  target  <u>Output</u>  <u>Artifacts</u>  that  do  not  have  a
              dedicated group specified later in the same call.

              Each  <b>&lt;artifact-kind&gt;</b>  <b>&lt;artifact-option&gt;...</b>  group  applies  to  <u>Output</u> <u>Artifacts</u> of the specified
              artifact kind:

              <b>ARCHIVE</b>
                     Target artifacts of this kind include:

                     • <u>Static</u> <u>libraries</u> (except on macOS when marked as <b>FRAMEWORK</b>, see below);

                     • <u>DLL</u> <u>import</u> <u>libraries</u> (on all Windows-based systems including Cygwin; they have  extension
                       <b>.lib</b>, in contrast to the <b>.dll</b> libraries that go to <b>RUNTIME</b>);

                     • On AIX, the <u>linker</u> <u>import</u> <u>file</u> created for executables with <u>ENABLE_EXPORTS</u> enabled.

                     • On macOS, the <u>linker</u> <u>import</u> <u>file</u> created for shared libraries with <u>ENABLE_EXPORTS</u> enabled
                       (except when marked as <b>FRAMEWORK</b>, see below).

              <b>LIBRARY</b>
                     Target artifacts of this kind include:

                     • <u>Shared</u> <u>libraries</u>, except

                       • DLLs (these go to <b>RUNTIME</b>, see below),

                       • on macOS when marked as <b>FRAMEWORK</b> (see below).

              <b>RUNTIME</b>
                     Target artifacts of this kind include:

                     • <u>Executables</u> (except on macOS when marked as <b>MACOSX_BUNDLE</b>, see <b>BUNDLE</b> below);

                     • DLLs  (on  all  Windows-based systems including Cygwin; note that the accompanying import
                       libraries are of kind <b>ARCHIVE</b>).

              <b>OBJECTS</b>
                     Added in version 3.9.

                     Object files associated with <u>object</u> <u>libraries</u>.

              <b>FRAMEWORK</b>
                     Both static and shared  libraries  marked  with  the  <b>FRAMEWORK</b>  property  are  treated  as
                     <b>FRAMEWORK</b> targets on macOS.

              <b>BUNDLE</b> Executables marked with the <u>MACOSX_BUNDLE</u> property are treated as <b>BUNDLE</b> targets on macOS.

              <b>PUBLIC_HEADER</b>
                     Any  <u>PUBLIC_HEADER</u>  files  associated  with  a  library  are  installed  in the destination
                     specified by the <b>PUBLIC_HEADER</b> argument on  non-Apple  platforms.  Rules  defined  by  this
                     argument  are  ignored  for  <u>FRAMEWORK</u>  libraries on Apple platforms because the associated
                     files are installed into  the  appropriate  locations  inside  the  framework  folder.  See
                     <u>PUBLIC_HEADER</u> for details.

              <b>PRIVATE_HEADER</b>
                     Similar to <b>PUBLIC_HEADER</b>, but for <b>PRIVATE_HEADER</b> files. See <u>PRIVATE_HEADER</u> for details.

              <b>RESOURCE</b>
                     Similar  to  <b>PUBLIC_HEADER</b>  and  <b>PRIVATE_HEADER</b>,  but  for <b>RESOURCE</b> files. See <u>RESOURCE</u> for
                     details.

              <b>FILE_SET</b> <b>&lt;set-name&gt;</b>
                     Added in version 3.23.

                     File sets are defined by the <u>target_sources(FILE_SET)</u> command.  If the file set  <b>&lt;set-name&gt;</b>
                     exists and is <b>PUBLIC</b> or <b>INTERFACE</b>, any files in the set are installed under the destination
                     (see  below).   The  directory  structure  relative  to  the file set's base directories is
                     preserved. For example, a file added to the file set as <b>/blah/include/myproj/here.h</b> with  a
                     base directory <b>/blah/include</b> would be installed to <b>myproj/here.h</b> below the destination.

              <b>CXX_MODULES_BMI</b>
                     Added in version 3.28.

                     Any  module  files  from  C++ modules from <b>PUBLIC</b> sources in a file set of type <b>CXX_MODULES</b>
                     will be installed to the  given  <b>DESTINATION</b>.  All  modules  are  placed  directly  in  the
                     destination  as  no  directory structure is derived from the names of the modules. An empty
                     <b>DESTINATION</b> may be used to suppress installing these files (for use in generic code).

              For regular executables, static libraries and shared libraries, the <b>DESTINATION</b>  argument  is  not
              required.   For  these  target  types,  when <b>DESTINATION</b> is omitted, a default destination will be
              taken from the appropriate variable from <u>GNUInstallDirs</u>, or set to a  built-in  default  value  if
              that  variable is not defined.  The same is true for file sets, and the public and private headers
              associated with  the  installed  targets  through  the  <u>PUBLIC_HEADER</u>  and  <u>PRIVATE_HEADER</u>  target
              properties.  A  destination  must  always  be  provided  for  module  libraries, Apple bundles and
              frameworks.  A destination can be omitted for interface and object libraries, but they are handled
              differently (see the discussion of this topic toward the end of this section).

              For shared libraries on DLL platforms, if neither <b>RUNTIME</b> nor <b>ARCHIVE</b> destinations are  specified,
              both  the  <b>RUNTIME</b> and <b>ARCHIVE</b> components are installed to their default destinations. If either a
              <b>RUNTIME</b> or <b>ARCHIVE</b> destination is specified, the component is installed to that  destination,  and
              the other component is not installed. If both <b>RUNTIME</b> and <b>ARCHIVE</b> destinations are specified, then
              both components are installed to their respective destinations.

              The  following  table shows the target types with their associated variables and built-in defaults
              that apply when no destination is given:

              Projects wishing to follow the common practice  of  installing  headers  into  a  project-specific
              subdirectory  may  prefer  using file sets with appropriate paths and base directories. Otherwise,
              they must provide a <b>DESTINATION</b> instead of being able to rely  on  the  above  (see  next  example
              below).

              To  make packages compliant with distribution filesystem layout policies, if projects must specify
              a <b>DESTINATION</b>, it is strongly recommended that they use a path that begins  with  the  appropriate
              relative  <u>GNUInstallDirs</u>  variable.   This  allows  package  maintainers  to  control  the install
              destination by setting the appropriate cache variables.  The  following  example  shows  a  static
              library  being  installed  to  the  default  destination  provided by <u>GNUInstallDirs</u>, but with its
              headers installed to a project-specific subdirectory without using file sets:

                 add_library(mylib STATIC ...)
                 set_target_properties(mylib PROPERTIES PUBLIC_HEADER mylib.h)
                 include(GNUInstallDirs)
                 install(TARGETS mylib
                         PUBLIC_HEADER
                           DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}/myproj
                 )

              In addition to the <u>common</u> <u>options</u> listed above, each target can accept  the  following  additional
              arguments:

              <b>NAMELINK_COMPONENT</b>
                     Added in version 3.12.

                     On some platforms a versioned shared library has a symbolic link such as:

                        lib&lt;name&gt;.so -&gt; lib&lt;name&gt;.so.1

                     where <b>lib&lt;name&gt;.so.1</b> is the soname of the library and <b>lib&lt;name&gt;.so</b> is a "namelink" allowing
                     linkers  to  find the library when given <b>-l&lt;name&gt;</b>. The <b>NAMELINK_COMPONENT</b> option is similar
                     to the <b>COMPONENT</b> option, but it changes the installation  component  of  a  shared  library
                     namelink if one is generated. If not specified, this defaults to the value of <b>COMPONENT</b>. It
                     is an error to use this parameter outside of a <b>LIBRARY</b> block.

                     Changed  in  version 3.27: This parameter is also usable for an <b>ARCHIVE</b> block to manage the
                     linker import file created, on macOS, for shared libraries with <u>ENABLE_EXPORTS</u> enabled.

                     See the <u>Example:</u>  <u>Install</u>  <u>Targets</u>  <u>with</u>  <u>Per-Artifact</u>  <u>Components</u>  for  an  example  using
                     <b>NAMELINK_COMPONENT</b>.

                     This  option  is  typically  used  for  package  managers  that  have  separate runtime and
                     development packages. For example, on Debian systems, the library is expected to be in  the
                     runtime  package,  and  the  headers  and  namelink  are  expected to be in the development
                     package.

                     See the <u>VERSION</u> and <u>SOVERSION</u> target properties for details on  creating  versioned  shared
                     libraries.

              <b>NAMELINK_ONLY</b>
                     This  option  causes  the  installation  of  only  the  namelink  when  a library target is
                     installed. On platforms where versioned shared libraries do not have namelinks  or  when  a
                     library  is not versioned, the <b>NAMELINK_ONLY</b> option installs nothing. It is an error to use
                     this parameter outside of a <b>LIBRARY</b> block.

                     Changed in version 3.27: This parameter is also usable for an <b>ARCHIVE</b> block to  manage  the
                     linker import file created, on macOS, for shared libraries with <u>ENABLE_EXPORTS</u> enabled.

                     When  <b>NAMELINK_ONLY</b> is given, either <b>NAMELINK_COMPONENT</b> or <b>COMPONENT</b> may be used to specify
                     the installation component of the namelink, but <b>COMPONENT</b> should generally be preferred.

              <b>NAMELINK_SKIP</b>
                     Similar to <b>NAMELINK_ONLY</b>, but it has the opposite effect: it  causes  the  installation  of
                     library  files  other  than  the  namelink when a library target is installed. When neither
                     <b>NAMELINK_ONLY</b> or <b>NAMELINK_SKIP</b> are given, both portions are installed. On  platforms  where
                     versioned  shared  libraries  do  not  have  symlinks  or  when a library is not versioned,
                     <b>NAMELINK_SKIP</b> installs the library. It is an error to  use  this  parameter  outside  of  a
                     <b>LIBRARY</b> block.

                     Changed  in  version 3.27: This parameter is also usable for an <b>ARCHIVE</b> block to manage the
                     linker import file created, on macOS, for shared libraries with <u>ENABLE_EXPORTS</u> enabled.

                     If <b>NAMELINK_SKIP</b> is specified, <b>NAMELINK_COMPONENT</b> has no effect. It is not  recommended  to
                     use <b>NAMELINK_SKIP</b> in conjunction with <b>NAMELINK_COMPONENT</b>.

              The <u>install(TARGETS)</u> command can also accept the following options at the top level:

              <b>EXPORT</b> This  option associates the installed target files with an export called <b>&lt;export-name&gt;</b>.  It
                     must appear before any target options.  To actually install the export  file  itself,  call
                     <u>install(EXPORT)</u>, documented below.  See documentation of the <u>EXPORT_NAME</u> target property to
                     change the name of the exported target.

                     If  <b>EXPORT</b>  is used and the targets include <b>PUBLIC</b> or <b>INTERFACE</b> file sets, all of them must
                     be specified with <b>FILE_SET</b> arguments. All <b>PUBLIC</b> or <b>INTERFACE</b> file sets associated  with  a
                     target are included in the export.

              <b>INCLUDES</b> <b>DESTINATION</b>
                     This   option   specifies   a   list   of   directories   which   will   be  added  to  the
                     <u>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> target  property  of  the  <b>&lt;targets&gt;</b>  when  exported  by  the
                     <u>install(EXPORT)</u> command.  If a relative path is specified, it is treated as relative to the
                     <u>$&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt;</u>.

                     Unlike other <b>DESTINATION</b> arguments for the various <b>install()</b> subcommands, paths given after
                     <b>INCLUDES</b>  <b>DESTINATION</b>  are  used  as  given.   They  are  not normalized, nor assumed to be
                     normalized, although it is  recommended  that  they  are  given  in  normalized  form  (see
                     <u>Normalization</u>).

              <b>RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET</b> <b>&lt;set-name&gt;</b>
                     Added in version 3.21.

                     This  option  causes  all runtime dependencies of installed executable, shared library, and
                     module targets to be added to the specified runtime dependency set. This set  can  then  be
                     installed with an <u>install(RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET)</u> command.

                     This keyword and the <b>RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES</b> keyword are mutually exclusive.

              <b>RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES</b> <b>&lt;arg&gt;...</b>
                     Added in version 3.21.

                     This  option  causes  all runtime dependencies of installed executable, shared library, and
                     module targets to be installed along with the targets  themselves.  The  <b>RUNTIME</b>,  <b>LIBRARY</b>,
                     <b>FRAMEWORK</b>,  and  generic  arguments  are  used  to  determine  the properties (<b>DESTINATION</b>,
                     <b>COMPONENT</b>, etc.) of the installation of these dependencies.

                     <b>RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES</b> is semantically equivalent to the following pair of calls:

                        install(TARGETS ... RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET &lt;set-name&gt;)
                        install(RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET &lt;set-name&gt; &lt;arg&gt;...)

                     where <b>&lt;set-name&gt;</b> will be a randomly generated set name.  <b>&lt;arg&gt;...</b> may include  any  of  the
                     following keywords supported by the <u>install(RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET)</u> command:

                     • <b>DIRECTORIES</b>

                     • <b>PRE_INCLUDE_REGEXES</b>

                     • <b>PRE_EXCLUDE_REGEXES</b>

                     • <b>POST_INCLUDE_REGEXES</b>

                     • <b>POST_EXCLUDE_REGEXES</b>

                     • <b>POST_INCLUDE_FILES</b>

                     • <b>POST_EXCLUDE_FILES</b>

                     The <b>RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES</b> and <b>RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET</b> keywords are mutually exclusive.

              <u>Interface</u>  <u>Libraries</u>  may  be  listed among the targets to install.  They install no artifacts but
              will be included in an associated <b>EXPORT</b>.  If <u>Object</u> <u>Libraries</u> are listed but given no destination
              for their object files, they will be exported as  <u>Interface</u>  <u>Libraries</u>.   This  is  sufficient  to
              satisfy  transitive usage requirements of other targets that link to the object libraries in their
              implementation.

              Installing a target with the <u>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</u> target property set to <b>TRUE</b> has undefined behavior.

              Added in version 3.3: An install destination given as a <b>DESTINATION</b> argument  may  use  "generator
              expressions"  with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available
              expressions.

              Added  in  version  3.13:  <u>install(TARGETS)</u>  can  install  targets  that  were  created  in  other
              directories.   When  using  such  cross-directory install rules, running <b>make</b> <b>install</b> (or similar)
              from a subdirectory will not guarantee that targets from other directories  are  up-to-date.   You
              can use <u>target_link_libraries()</u> or <u>add_dependencies()</u> to ensure that such out-of-directory targets
              are built before the subdirectory-specific install rules are run.

       <b>install(IMPORTED_RUNTIME_ARTIFACTS</b> <b>&lt;target&gt;...</b> <b>[...])</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              Install runtime artifacts of imported targets:

                 install(IMPORTED_RUNTIME_ARTIFACTS &lt;target&gt;...
                         [RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET &lt;set-name&gt;]
                         [[LIBRARY|RUNTIME|FRAMEWORK|BUNDLE]
                          [DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;]
                          [PERMISSIONS &lt;permission&gt;...]
                          [CONFIGURATIONS &lt;config&gt;...]
                          [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
                          [OPTIONAL] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
                         ] [...]
                         )

              The  <b>IMPORTED_RUNTIME_ARTIFACTS</b>  form  specifies  rules  for  installing  the runtime artifacts of
              imported targets. Projects may do this if they want  to  bundle  outside  executables  or  modules
              inside  their  installation.  The  <b>LIBRARY</b>, <b>RUNTIME</b>, <b>FRAMEWORK</b>, and <b>BUNDLE</b> arguments have the same
              semantics that they do in the <u>TARGETS</u> mode. Only the runtime artifacts  of  imported  targets  are
              installed  (except  in  the  case  of  <u>FRAMEWORK</u>  libraries, <u>MACOSX_BUNDLE</u> executables, and <u>BUNDLE</u>
              CFBundles.) For example, headers and import libraries associated with DLLs are not  installed.  In
              the  case  of  <u>FRAMEWORK</u>  libraries,  <u>MACOSX_BUNDLE</u>  executables, and <u>BUNDLE</u> CFBundles, the entire
              directory is installed.

              The <b>RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET</b> option causes the runtime artifacts of the imported executable,  shared
              library, and module library <b>targets</b> to be added to the <b>&lt;set-name&gt;</b> runtime dependency set. This set
              can then be installed with an <u>install(RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET)</u> command.

       <b>install(FILES</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b> <b>[...])</b>

       <b>install(PROGRAMS</b> <b>&lt;program&gt;...</b> <b>[...])</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If  installing  header  files,  consider  using  file  sets defined by <u>target_sources(FILE_SET)</u>
                 instead. File sets associate headers with a target and they install as part of the target.

              Install files or programs:

                 install(&lt;FILES|PROGRAMS&gt; &lt;file&gt;...
                         TYPE &lt;type&gt; | DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
                         [PERMISSIONS &lt;permission&gt;...]
                         [CONFIGURATIONS &lt;config&gt;...]
                         [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
                         [RENAME &lt;name&gt;] [OPTIONAL] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])

              The <b>FILES</b> form specifies rules for installing files for a project.  File names given  as  relative
              paths  are interpreted with respect to the current source directory.  Files installed by this form
              are by default given  permissions  <b>OWNER_WRITE</b>,  <b>OWNER_READ</b>,  <b>GROUP_READ</b>,  and  <b>WORLD_READ</b>  if  no
              <b>PERMISSIONS</b> argument is given.

              The  <b>PROGRAMS</b>  form  is  identical  to  the <b>FILES</b> form except that the default permissions for the
              installed file also  include  <b>OWNER_EXECUTE</b>,  <b>GROUP_EXECUTE</b>,  and  <b>WORLD_EXECUTE</b>.   This  form  is
              intended to install programs that are not targets, such as shell scripts.  Use the <b>TARGETS</b> form to
              install targets built within the project.

              The  list  of  <b>files...</b> given to <b>FILES</b> or <b>PROGRAMS</b> may use "generator expressions" with the syntax
              <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  However, if any
              item begins in a generator expression it must evaluate to a full path.

              The optional <b>RENAME</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> argument is used to specify a name  for  the  installed  file  that  is
              different  from  the original file name.  Renaming is allowed only when a single file is installed
              by the command.

              Either a <b>TYPE</b> or a <b>DESTINATION</b> must be provided, but not both.   A  <b>TYPE</b>  argument  specifies  the
              generic  file  type of the files being installed.  A destination will then be set automatically by
              taking the corresponding variable from <u>GNUInstallDirs</u>, or by using  a  built-in  default  if  that
              variable is not defined.  See the table below for the supported file types and their corresponding
              variables  and  built-in  defaults.  Projects can provide a <b>DESTINATION</b> argument instead of a file
              type if they wish to explicitly define the install destination.

              Projects wishing to follow the common practice  of  installing  headers  into  a  project-specific
              subdirectory will need to provide a destination rather than rely on the above. Using file sets for
              headers instead of <b>install(FILES)</b> would be even better (see <u>target_sources(FILE_SET)</u>).

              Note  that  some  of  the  types'  built-in  defaults  use the <b>DATAROOT</b> directory as a prefix. The
              <b>DATAROOT</b> prefix is calculated similarly  to  the  types,  with  <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_DATAROOTDIR</b>  as  the
              variable  and  <b>share</b>  as the built-in default. You cannot use <b>DATAROOT</b> as a <b>TYPE</b> parameter; please
              use <b>DATA</b> instead.

              To make packages compliant with distribution filesystem layout policies, if projects must  specify
              a  <b>DESTINATION</b>,  it  is strongly recommended that they use a path that begins with the appropriate
              relative <u>GNUInstallDirs</u>  variable.   This  allows  package  maintainers  to  control  the  install
              destination by setting the appropriate cache variables.  The following example shows how to follow
              this advice while installing an image to a project-specific documentation subdirectory:

                 include(GNUInstallDirs)
                 install(FILES logo.png
                         DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_DOCDIR}/myproj
                 )

              Added  in  version  3.4: An install destination given as a <b>DESTINATION</b> argument may use "generator
              expressions" with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for  available
              expressions.

              Added  in  version  3.20:  An  install  rename  given  as  a  <b>RENAME</b>  argument  may use "generator
              expressions" with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for  available
              expressions.

              Added in version 3.31: The <b>TYPE</b> argument now supports type <b>LIBEXEC</b>.

       <b>install(DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;...</b> <b>[...])</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 To   install   a   directory   sub-tree  of  headers,  consider  using  file  sets  defined  by
                 <u>target_sources(FILE_SET)</u> instead. File sets not only preserve directory  structure,  they  also
                 associate headers with a target and install as part of the target.

              Install the contents of one or more directories:

                 install(DIRECTORY dirs...
                         TYPE &lt;type&gt; | DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
                         [FILE_PERMISSIONS &lt;permission&gt;...]
                         [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS &lt;permission&gt;...]
                         [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [OPTIONAL] [MESSAGE_NEVER]
                         [CONFIGURATIONS &lt;config&gt;...]
                         [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
                         [FILES_MATCHING]
                         [[PATTERN &lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX &lt;regex&gt;]
                          [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS &lt;permission&gt;...]] [...])

              The  <b>DIRECTORY</b>  form  installs  contents  of  one or more directories to a given destination.  The
              directory structure is copied verbatim to the destination.  The last component of  each  directory
              name  is  appended  to  the  destination  directory but a trailing slash may be used to avoid this
              because it leaves the  last  component  empty.   Directory  names  given  as  relative  paths  are
              interpreted  with  respect to the current source directory.  If no input directory names are given
              the  destination  directory  will  be  created  but  nothing  will  be  installed  into  it.   The
              <b>FILE_PERMISSIONS</b>  and  <b>DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS</b>  options  specify  permissions  given  to  files  and
              directories in the destination.  If <b>USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS</b> is specified  and  <b>FILE_PERMISSIONS</b>  is
              not,  file  permissions will be copied from the source directory structure.  If no permissions are
              specified files will be given the default permissions specified in the <b>FILES</b> form of the  command,
              and  the  directories  will be given the default permissions specified in the <b>PROGRAMS</b> form of the
              command.

              Added in version 3.1: The <b>MESSAGE_NEVER</b> option disables file installation status output.

              Installation of directories may be controlled with fine granularity using  the  <b>PATTERN</b>  or  <b>REGEX</b>
              options.   These  "match"  options  specify  a  globbing  pattern  or  regular expression to match
              directories or files encountered within input directories.  They may  be  used  to  apply  certain
              options  (see  below) to a subset of the files and directories encountered.  The full path to each
              input file or directory (with forward slashes) is matched against the expression.  A <b>PATTERN</b>  will
              match  only  complete  file names: the portion of the full path matching the pattern must occur at
              the end of the file name and be preceded by a slash.  A <b>REGEX</b> will match any portion of  the  full
              path  but  it  may  use  <b>/</b>  and  <b>$</b>  to  simulate  the  <b>PATTERN</b> behavior.  By default all files and
              directories are installed whether or not they are matched.  The <b>FILES_MATCHING</b> option may be given
              before the first match option to disable installation of files (but not directories)  not  matched
              by any expression.  For example, the code

                 install(DIRECTORY src/ DESTINATION doc/myproj
                         FILES_MATCHING PATTERN "*.png")

              will extract and install images from a source tree.

              Some  options  may  follow  a <b>PATTERN</b> or <b>REGEX</b> expression as described under <u>string(REGEX)</u> and are
              applied only to files or directories matching them.  The <b>EXCLUDE</b> option will skip the matched file
              or directory.  The <b>PERMISSIONS</b> option overrides the permissions setting for the  matched  file  or
              directory.  For example the code

                 install(DIRECTORY icons scripts/ DESTINATION share/myproj
                         PATTERN "CVS" EXCLUDE
                         PATTERN "scripts/*"
                         PERMISSIONS OWNER_EXECUTE OWNER_WRITE OWNER_READ
                                     GROUP_EXECUTE GROUP_READ)

              will  install the <b>icons</b> directory to <b>share/myproj/icons</b> and the <b>scripts</b> directory to <b>share/myproj</b>.
              The icons will get default file permissions, the scripts will be given specific  permissions,  and
              any <b>CVS</b> directories will be excluded.

              Either  a  <b>TYPE</b>  or  a  <b>DESTINATION</b> must be provided, but not both.  A <b>TYPE</b> argument specifies the
              generic file type of the files within the listed directories being installed.  A destination  will
              then  be set automatically by taking the corresponding variable from <u>GNUInstallDirs</u>, or by using a
              built-in default if that variable is not defined.  See the table  below  for  the  supported  file
              types and their corresponding variables and built-in defaults.  Projects can provide a <b>DESTINATION</b>
              argument instead of a file type if they wish to explicitly define the install destination.

              Note  that  some  of  the  types'  built-in  defaults  use the <b>DATAROOT</b> directory as a prefix. The
              <b>DATAROOT</b> prefix is calculated similarly  to  the  types,  with  <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_DATAROOTDIR</b>  as  the
              variable  and  <b>share</b>  as the built-in default. You cannot use <b>DATAROOT</b> as a <b>TYPE</b> parameter; please
              use <b>DATA</b> instead.

              To make packages compliant with distribution filesystem layout policies, if projects must  specify
              a  <b>DESTINATION</b>,  it  is strongly recommended that they use a path that begins with the appropriate

              destination by setting the appropriate cache variables.

              Added  in  version  3.4: An install destination given as a <b>DESTINATION</b> argument may use "generator
              expressions" with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for  available
              expressions.

              Added in version 3.5: The list of <b>dirs...</b> given to <b>DIRECTORY</b> may use "generator expressions" too.

              Added in version 3.31: The <b>TYPE</b> argument now supports type <b>LIBEXEC</b>.

       <b>install(SCRIPT</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> <b>[...])</b>

       <b>install(CODE</b> <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> <b>[...])</b>
              Invoke CMake scripts or code during installation:

                 install([[SCRIPT &lt;file&gt;] [CODE &lt;code&gt;]]
                         [ALL_COMPONENTS | COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
                         [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [...])

              The  <b>SCRIPT</b> form will invoke the given CMake script files during installation.  If the script file
              name is a relative path it will be interpreted with respect to the current source directory.   The
              <b>CODE</b>  form  will  invoke  the given CMake code during installation.  Code is specified as a single
              argument inside a double-quoted string.  For example, the code

                 install(CODE "MESSAGE(\"Sample install message.\")")

              will print a message during installation.

              Added in version 3.21: When the <b>ALL_COMPONENTS</b> option is given,  the  custom  installation  script
              code  will  be  executed for every component of a component-specific installation.  This option is
              mutually exclusive with the <b>COMPONENT</b> option.

              Added in version 3.14: <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> may use "generator expressions" with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b> (in
              the case of <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>, this refers to their use in the file name, not the file's contents).  See  the
              <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.

       <b>install(EXPORT</b> <b>&lt;export-name&gt;</b> <b>[...])</b>
              Install a CMake file exporting targets for dependent projects:

                 install(EXPORT &lt;export-name&gt; DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
                         [NAMESPACE &lt;namespace&gt;] [FILE &lt;name&gt;.cmake]
                         [PERMISSIONS &lt;permission&gt;...]
                         [CONFIGURATIONS &lt;config&gt;...]
                         [CXX_MODULES_DIRECTORY &lt;directory&gt;]
                         [EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES]
                         [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
                         [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
                         [EXPORT_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES])
                 install(EXPORT_ANDROID_MK &lt;export-name&gt; DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt; [...])

              The  <b>EXPORT</b>  form  generates  and installs a CMake file containing code to import targets from the
              installation tree into another project.  Target  installations  are  associated  with  the  export
              <b>&lt;export-name&gt;</b>  using  the  <b>EXPORT</b>  option of the <u>install(TARGETS)</u> signature documented above.  The
              <b>NAMESPACE</b> option will prepend <b>&lt;namespace&gt;</b> to the target names as they are written  to  the  import
              file.  By default the generated file will be called <b>&lt;export-name&gt;.cmake</b> but the <b>FILE</b> option may be
              used to specify a different name.  The value given to the <b>FILE</b> option must be a file name with the
              <b>.cmake</b> extension.

              If  a  <b>CONFIGURATIONS</b>  option  is given then the file will only be installed when one of the named
              configurations is installed.  Additionally, the generated import  file  will  reference  only  the
              matching  target  configurations.   See  the  <u>CMAKE_MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>  variable  to map
              configurations    of    dependent    projects    to    the    installed    configurations.     The
              <b>EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</b>  keyword,  if  present,  causes  the  contents  of  the properties
              matching <b>(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)?</b> to be exported, when policy  <u>CMP0022</u>  is
              <b>NEW</b>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 The   installed   <b>&lt;export-name&gt;.cmake</b>   file   may   come   with  additional  per-configuration
                 <b>&lt;export-name&gt;-*.cmake</b> files to be loaded by globbing.  Do not use an export name  that  is  the
                 same  as  the package name in combination with installing a <b>&lt;package-name&gt;-config.cmake</b> file or
                 the latter may be incorrectly matched by the glob and loaded.

              When a <b>COMPONENT</b> option is given, the listed <b>&lt;component&gt;</b>  implicitly  depends  on  all  components
              mentioned  in  the  export  set.  The exported <b>&lt;name&gt;.cmake</b> file will require each of the exported
              components to be present in order for dependent projects to build properly. For example, a project
              may define components <b>Runtime</b> and <b>Development</b>,  with  shared  libraries  going  into  the  <b>Runtime</b>
              component  and  static  libraries and headers going into the <b>Development</b> component. The export set
              would also typically be part of the <b>Development</b> component, but it would export targets  from  both
              the  <b>Runtime</b>  and  <b>Development</b>  components.  Therefore,  the  <b>Runtime</b>  component  would need to be
              installed if the <b>Development</b> component was installed, but  not  vice  versa.  If  the  <b>Development</b>
              component was installed without the <b>Runtime</b> component, dependent projects that try to link against
              it  would  have  build  errors.  Package  managers,  such as APT and RPM, typically handle this by
              listing the <b>Runtime</b> component as  a  dependency  of  the  <b>Development</b>  component  in  the  package
              metadata,  ensuring  that the library is always installed if the headers and CMake export file are
              present.

              Added in version 3.7: In addition to cmake language files, the <b>EXPORT_ANDROID_MK</b> mode may be  used
              to  specify  an export to the android ndk build system.  This mode accepts the same options as the
              normal export mode.  The Android NDK supports the use  of  prebuilt  libraries,  both  static  and
              shared.  This  allows  cmake to build the libraries of a project and make them available to an ndk
              build system complete with transitive dependencies, include flags and defines required to use  the
              libraries.

              <b>CXX_MODULES_DIRECTORY</b>
                     Added in version 3.28.

                     Specify  a subdirectory to store C++ module information for targets in the export set. This
                     directory will be populated with files which add the necessary target property  information
                     to  the relevant targets. Note that without this information, none of the C++ modules which
                     are part of the targets in the export set will support being imported in consuming targets.

              <b>EXPORT_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES</b>

                     <b>NOTE:</b>
                        Experimental. Gated by <b>CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_EXPORT_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES</b>.

                     Specify that <u>find_dependency()</u> calls should be exported. If  this  argument  is  specified,
                     CMake  examines  all targets in the export set and gathers their <b>INTERFACE</b> link targets. If
                     any such targets either were found with <u>find_package()</u> or have the <u>EXPORT_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME</u>
                     property set, and such package dependency was  not  disabled  by  passing  <b>ENABLED</b>  <b>OFF</b>  to
                     <u>export(SETUP)</u>,  then  a  <u>find_dependency()</u>  call is written with the target's corresponding
                     package name, a <b>REQUIRED</b> argument, and any additional arguments specified by the <b>EXTRA_ARGS</b>
                     argument of <u>export(SETUP)</u>. Any package dependencies that were manually specified by passing
                     <b>ENABLED</b> <b>ON</b> to <u>export(SETUP)</u> are also added, even if the exported targets  don't  depend  on
                     any targets from them.

                     The <u>find_dependency()</u> calls are written in the following order:

                     1. Any package dependencies that were listed in <u>export(SETUP)</u> are written in the order they
                        were  first  specified, regardless of whether or not they contain <b>INTERFACE</b> dependencies
                        of the exported targets.

                     2. Any package dependencies that  contain  <b>INTERFACE</b>  link  dependencies  of  the  exported
                        targets  and  that  were  never specified in <u>export(SETUP)</u> are written in the order they
                        were first found.

              The <b>EXPORT</b> form is useful to help outside projects use targets built and installed by the  current
              project.  For example, the code

                 install(TARGETS myexe EXPORT myproj DESTINATION bin)
                 install(EXPORT myproj NAMESPACE mp_ DESTINATION lib/myproj)
                 install(EXPORT_ANDROID_MK myproj DESTINATION share/ndk-modules)

              will   install  the  executable  <b>myexe</b>  to  <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a></b>  and  code  to  import  it  in  the  file
              <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/myproj/myproj.cmake</b> and <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/share/ndk-modules/Android.mk</b>.   An  outside  project
              may  load  this  file  with  the  include  command  and  reference  the  <b>myexe</b> executable from the
              installation tree using the imported target name <b>mp_myexe</b> as if the target were built in  its  own
              tree.

              The  <b>PACKAGE_INFO</b>  form generates and installs a Common Package Specification file which describes
              installed targets such that they can be consumed by another  project.   Target  installations  are
              associated with the export <b>&lt;export-name&gt;</b> using the <b>EXPORT</b> option of the <u>install(TARGETS)</u> signature
              documented  above.   Unlike  <u>install(EXPORT)</u>, this information is not expressed in CMake code, and
              can be consumed by tools other than CMake.  When imported into another CMake project, the imported
              targets will be prefixed with <b>&lt;package-name&gt;::</b>.  By default, the generated  file  will  be  called
              <b>&lt;package-name&gt;[-&lt;appendix-name&gt;].cps</b>.  If <b>LOWER_CASE_FILE</b> is given, the package name as it appears
              on disk (in both the file name and install destination) will be first converted to lower case.

              If <b>DESTINATION</b> is not specified, a platform-specific default is used.

              If  <b>APPENDIX</b> is specified, rather than generating a top level package specification, the specified
              targets will be exported as an appendix to the named package.  Appendices may be used to  separate
              less  commonly  used  targets (along with their external dependencies) from the rest of a package.
              This enables consumers to ignore transitive dependencies for targets that they don't use, and also
              allows a single logical "package" to be composed of artifacts produced by multiple build trees.

              Appendices are not permitted to  change  basic  package  metadata;  therefore,  none  of  <b>VERSION</b>,
              <b>COMPAT_VERSION</b>,  <b>VERSION_SCHEMA</b>,  <b>DEFAULT_TARGETS</b>  or  <b>DEFAULT_CONFIGURATIONS</b>  may be specified in
              combination with <b>APPENDIX</b>.  Additionally, it is strongly recommended that use  of  <b>LOWER_CASE_FILE</b>
              should be consistent between the main package and any appendices.

                         [DIRECTORIES &lt;dir&gt;...]
                         )

              Installs  a  runtime  dependency  set  previously  created  by  one  or  more  <u>install(TARGETS)</u> or
              <u>install(IMPORTED_RUNTIME_ARTIFACTS)</u> commands.  The dependencies of targets belonging to a  runtime
              dependency set are installed in the <b>RUNTIME</b> destination and component on DLL platforms, and in the
              <b>LIBRARY</b>  destination  and  component  on non-DLL platforms.  macOS frameworks are installed in the
              <b>FRAMEWORK</b> destination and component.  Targets built within the build tree will never be  installed
              as  runtime  dependencies,  nor  will  their  own  dependencies, unless the targets themselves are
              installed with <u>install(TARGETS)</u>.

              The generated install script calls  <u>file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)</u>  on  the  build-tree  files  to
              calculate  the runtime dependencies. The build-tree executable files are passed as the <b>EXECUTABLES</b>
              argument, the build-tree shared libraries as the <b>LIBRARIES</b> argument, and the build-tree modules as
              the <b>MODULES</b> argument. On macOS, if one of the executables is a <u>MACOSX_BUNDLE</u>, that  executable  is
              passed as the <b>BUNDLE_EXECUTABLE</b> argument. At most one such bundle executable may be in the runtime
              dependency  set  on  macOS. The <u>MACOSX_BUNDLE</u> property has no effect on other platforms. Note that
              <u>file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)</u> only supports collecting  the  runtime  dependencies  for  Windows,
              Linux and macOS platforms, so <b>install(RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET)</b> has the same limitation.

              The   following   sub-arguments   are   forwarded   through  as  the  corresponding  arguments  to
              <u>file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)</u> (for those that provide a non-empty list  of  directories,  regular
              expressions or files).  They all support <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This   command   supersedes   the   <u>install_targets()</u>   command   and   the   <u>PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT</u>   and
          <u>POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT</u> target properties.  It also replaces the <b>FILES</b> forms of  the  <u>install_files()</u>  and
          <u>install_programs()</u>  commands.  The processing order of these install rules relative to those generated
          by <u>install_targets()</u>, <u>install_files()</u>, and <u>install_programs()</u> commands is not defined.

   <b>Examples</b>
   <b>Example:</b> <b>Install</b> <b>Targets</b> <b>with</b> <b>Per-Artifact</b> <b>Components</b>
       Consider a project that defines targets with different artifact kinds:

          add_executable(myExe myExe.c)
          add_library(myStaticLib STATIC myStaticLib.c)
          target_sources(myStaticLib PUBLIC FILE_SET HEADERS FILES myStaticLib.h)
          add_library(mySharedLib SHARED mySharedLib.c)
          target_sources(mySharedLib PUBLIC FILE_SET HEADERS FILES mySharedLib.h)
          set_property(TARGET mySharedLib PROPERTY SOVERSION 1)

       We may call <u>install(TARGETS)</u> with <u>&lt;artifact-kind&gt;</u> arguments to specify different options for each kind of
       artifact:

          install(TARGETS
                    myExe
                    mySharedLib
                    myStaticLib
                  RUNTIME           # Following options apply to runtime artifacts.
                    COMPONENT Runtime
                  LIBRARY           # Following options apply to library artifacts.
                    COMPONENT Runtime
                    NAMELINK_COMPONENT Development
                  ARCHIVE           # Following options apply to archive artifacts.
                    COMPONENT Development
                    DESTINATION lib/static
                  FILE_SET HEADERS  # Following options apply to file set HEADERS.
                    COMPONENT Development
                  )

       This will:

       • Install <b>myExe</b> to <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a></b>, the default  RUNTIME  artifact  destination,  as  part  of  the  <b>Runtime</b>
         component.

       • On non-DLL platforms:

         • Install <b>libmySharedLib.so.1</b> to <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></b>, the default LIBRARY artifact destination, as part of the
           <b>Runtime</b> component.

         • Install  the  <b>libmySharedLib.so</b>  "namelink"  (symbolic  link)  to  <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></b>,  the default LIBRARY
           artifact destination, as part of the <b>Development</b> component.

       • On DLL platforms:

         • Install <b>mySharedLib.dll</b> to <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a></b>, the default RUNTIME artifact destination,  as  part  of  the
           <b>Runtime</b> component.

         • Install  <b>mySharedLib.lib</b>  to <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/static</b>, the specified ARCHIVE artifact destination, as part
           of the <b>Development</b> component.

       • Install <b>myStaticLib</b> to <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/static</b>, the specified ARCHIVE artifact destination, as part of  the
         <b>Development</b> component.

       • Install  <b>mySharedLib.h</b> and <b>myStaticLib.h</b> to <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include</b>, the default destination for a file set of
         type HEADERS, as part of the <b>Development</b> component.

   <b>Example:</b> <b>Install</b> <b>Targets</b> <b>to</b> <b>Per-Config</b> <b>Destinations</b>
       Each <u>install(TARGETS)</u> call installs a given target <u>output</u> <u>artifact</u> to at most one  <b>DESTINATION</b>,  but  the
       install  rule  itself  may  be filtered by the <b>CONFIGURATIONS</b> option.  In order to install to a different
       destination for each configuration, one call per configuration is needed.  For example, the code:

          install(TARGETS myExe
                  CONFIGURATIONS Debug
                  RUNTIME
                    DESTINATION Debug/bin
                  )
          install(TARGETS myExe
                  CONFIGURATIONS Release
                  RUNTIME
                    DESTINATION Release/bin
                  )

       will install <b>myExe</b> to <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/Debug/bin</b> in the Debug configuration, and to <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/Release/bin</b>  in  the
       Release configuration.

   <b>Generated</b> <b>Installation</b> <b>Script</b>
       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Use of this feature is not recommended. Please consider using the <u>cmake</u> <u>--install</u> instead.

       The  <b>install()</b>  command  generates a file, <b>cmake_install.cmake</b>, inside the build directory, which is used
       internally by the generated install target and by CPack. You can also invoke this  script  manually  with
       <u>cmake</u> <u>-P</u>. This script accepts several variables:

       <b>COMPONENT</b>
              Set this variable to install only a single CPack component as opposed to all of them. For example,
              if  you  only  want  to  install  the  <b>Development</b> component, run <b>cmake</b> <b>-DCOMPONENT=Development</b> <b>-P</b>
              <b>cmake_install.cmake</b>.

       <b>BUILD_TYPE</b>
              Set this variable to change the build type if you are using a multi-config generator. For example,
              to install with the <b>Debug</b> configuration, run <b>cmake</b> <b>-DBUILD_TYPE=Debug</b> <b>-P</b> <b>cmake_install.cmake</b>.

       <b>DESTDIR</b>
              This is an environment variable rather than  a  CMake  variable.  It  allows  you  to  change  the
              installation prefix on UNIX systems. See <u>DESTDIR</u> for details.

   <b>link_directories</b>
       Add directories in which the linker will look for libraries.

          link_directories([AFTER|BEFORE] directory1 [directory2 ...])

       Adds the paths in which the linker should search for libraries.  Relative paths given to this command are
       interpreted as relative to the current source directory, see <u>CMP0015</u>.

       The command will apply only to targets created after it is called.

       Added  in  version  3.13:  The  directories  are added to the <u>LINK_DIRECTORIES</u> directory property for the
       current  <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>  file,  converting   relative   paths   to   absolute   as   needed.    See   the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

       Added  in  version  3.13:  By  default  the  directories  specified are appended onto the current list of
       directories.  This default behavior can be changed by setting <u>CMAKE_LINK_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE</u>  to  <b>ON</b>.   By
       using  <b>AFTER</b>  or  <b>BEFORE</b>  explicitly, you can select between appending and prepending, independent of the
       default.

       Added in version 3.13: Arguments to <b>link_directories</b> may use  "generator  expressions"  with  the  syntax
       "$&lt;...&gt;".  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This  command is rarely necessary and should be avoided where there are other choices.  Prefer to pass
          full absolute paths to libraries where possible, since this ensures the correct library will always be
          linked.  The <u>find_library()</u> command provides the full path, which can generally be  used  directly  in
          calls to <u>target_link_libraries()</u>.  Situations where a library search path may be needed include:

          • Project  generators  like  Xcode  where the user can switch target architecture at build time, but a
            full path to a library cannot be used because it only provides one architecture (i.e. it  is  not  a
            universal binary).

          • Libraries  may  themselves have other private library dependencies that expect to be found via <b>RPATH</b>
            mechanisms, but some linkers are not able to fully decode those paths (e.g. due to the  presence  of
            things like <b>$ORIGIN</b>).

          If  a  library search path must be provided, prefer to localize the effect where possible by using the
          <u>target_link_directories()</u> command rather than <b>link_directories()</b>.   The  target-specific  command  can
          also control how the search directories propagate to other dependent targets.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • <u>target_link_directories()</u>

       • <u>target_link_libraries()</u>

   <b>link_libraries</b>
       Link libraries to all targets added later.

          link_libraries([item1 [item2 [...]]]
                         [[debug|optimized|general] &lt;item&gt;] ...)

       Specify  libraries  or  flags  to  use when linking any targets created later in the current directory or
       below by commands such as <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u>.  See the <u>target_link_libraries()</u> command for
       meaning of arguments.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The <u>target_link_libraries()</u> command should be preferred whenever possible.  Library  dependencies  are
          chained automatically, so directory-wide specification of link libraries is rarely needed.

   <b>load_cache</b>
       Load in the values from another project's CMake cache.

          load_cache(pathToBuildDirectory READ_WITH_PREFIX prefix entry1...)

       Reads  the  cache  and  store  the requested entries in variables with their name prefixed with the given
       prefix.  This only reads the values, and does not create entries in the local project's cache.

          load_cache(pathToBuildDirectory [EXCLUDE entry1...]
                     [INCLUDE_INTERNALS entry1...])

       Loads in the values from another cache and store them in the local project's cache as  internal  entries.
       This  is  useful for a project that depends on another project built in a different tree.  <b>EXCLUDE</b> option
       can be used to provide a list of entries to be excluded.  <b>INCLUDE_INTERNALS</b> can be used to provide a list
       of internal entries to be included.  Normally, no internal entries are brought in.  Use of this  form  of
       the command is strongly discouraged, but it is provided for backward compatibility.

   <b>project</b>
       Set the name of the project.

          project(&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;
                  [VERSION &lt;major&gt;[.&lt;minor&gt;[.&lt;patch&gt;[.&lt;tweak&gt;]]]]
                  [DESCRIPTION &lt;project-description-string&gt;]
                  [HOMEPAGE_URL &lt;url-string&gt;]
                  [LANGUAGES &lt;language-name&gt;...])

       Sets  the name of the project, and stores it in the variable <u>PROJECT_NAME</u>. When called from the top-level
       <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> also stores the project name in the variable <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME</u>.

       Also sets the variables:

       <u>PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR</u><b>,</b> <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_SOURCE_DIR</u>
              Absolute path to the source directory for the project.

       <u>PROJECT_BINARY_DIR</u><b>,</b> <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_BINARY_DIR</u>
              Absolute path to the binary directory for the project.

       <u>PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL</u><b>,</b> <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_IS_TOP_LEVEL</u>
              Added in version 3.21.

              Boolean value indicating whether the project is top-level.

       Further variables are set by the optional arguments described in <u>Options</u> further below. Where  an  option
       is not given, its corresponding variable is set to the empty string.

       Note that variables of the form <b>&lt;name&gt;_SOURCE_DIR</b> and <b>&lt;name&gt;_BINARY_DIR</b> may also be set by other commands
       before  <b>project()</b>  is  called  (see  the <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> command for one example).  Projects
       should not rely on <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_SOURCE_DIR</b> or  <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_BINARY_DIR</b>  holding  a  particular  value
       outside of the scope of the call to <b>project()</b> or one of its child scopes.

       Changed     in     version     3.30:     <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_SOURCE_DIR</b>,     <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_BINARY_DIR</b>,    and
       <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_IS_TOP_LEVEL</b>, if already set as  normal  variables  when  <b>project(&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;</b>  <b>...)</b>  is
       called,  are updated by the call.  Cache entries by the same names are always set as before.  See release
       notes for 3.30.3, 3.30.4, and 3.30.5 for details.

       Changed    in     version     3.31:     <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_SOURCE_DIR</b>,     <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_BINARY_DIR</b>,     and
       <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_IS_TOP_LEVEL</b>  are  always  set  as  normal  variables by <b>project(&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;</b> <b>...)</b>.  See
       policy <u>CMP0180</u>.  Cache entries by the same names are always set as before.

   <b>Options</b>
       The options are:

       <b>VERSION</b> <b>&lt;version&gt;</b>
              Optional; may not be used unless policy <u>CMP0048</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>.

              Takes   a   <b>&lt;version&gt;</b>   argument   composed   of    non-negative    integer    components,    i.e.
              <b>&lt;major&gt;[.&lt;minor&gt;[.&lt;patch&gt;[.&lt;tweak&gt;]]]</b>, and sets the variables

              • <u>PROJECT_VERSION</u>, <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION</u>

              • <u>PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR</u>, <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR</u>

              • <u>PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR</u>, <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION_MINOR</u>

              • <u>PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH</u>, <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION_PATCH</u>

              • <u>PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK</u>, <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION_TWEAK</u>.

              Added  in  version  3.12:  When the <b>project()</b> command is called from the top-level <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>,
              then the version is also stored in the variable <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION</u>.

       <b>DESCRIPTION</b> <b>&lt;project-description-string&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.9.

              Optional.  Sets the variables

              • <u>PROJECT_DESCRIPTION</u>, <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_DESCRIPTION</u>

              to <b>&lt;project-description-string&gt;</b>.  It is recommended that this description is  a  relatively  short
              string, usually no more than a few words.

              When  the  <b>project()</b>  command is called from the top-level <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>, then the description is
              also stored in the variable <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION</u>.

              Added in version 3.12: Added the <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_DESCRIPTION</b> variable.

       <b>HOMEPAGE_URL</b> <b>&lt;url-string&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              Optional.  Sets the variables

              • <u>PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL</u>, <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_HOMEPAGE_URL</u>

              to <b>&lt;url-string&gt;</b>, which should be the canonical home URL for the project.

              When the <b>project()</b> command is called from the top-level  <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>,  then  the  URL  also  is
              stored in the variable <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL</u>.

       <b>LANGUAGES</b> <b>&lt;language-name&gt;...</b>
              Optional.  Can also be specified without <b>LANGUAGES</b> keyword per the first, short signature.

              Selects which programming languages are needed to build the project.

       Supported  languages  are  <b>C</b>,  <b>CXX</b>  (i.e.  C++), <b>CSharp</b> (i.e.  C#), <b>CUDA</b>, <b>OBJC</b> (i.e. Objective-C), <b>OBJCXX</b>
       (i.e. Objective-C++), <b>Fortran</b>, <b>HIP</b>, <b>ISPC</b>, <b>Swift</b>, <b>ASM</b>, <b>ASM_NASM</b>, <b>ASM_MARMASM</b>, <b>ASM_MASM</b>, and <b>ASM-ATT</b>.
          Added in version 3.8: Added <b>CSharp</b> and <b>CUDA</b> support.

          Added in version 3.15: Added <b>Swift</b> support.

          Added in version 3.16: Added <b>OBJC</b> and <b>OBJCXX</b> support.

          Added in version 3.18: Added <b>ISPC</b> support.

          Added in version 3.21: Added <b>HIP</b> support.

          Added in version 3.26: Added <b>ASM_MARMASM</b> support.

       If enabling <b>ASM</b>, list it last so that CMake can check whether compilers for other languages like  <b>C</b>  work
       for assembly too.

       By  default  <b>C</b>  and  <b>CXX</b> are enabled if no language options are given.  Specify language <b>NONE</b>, or use the
       <b>LANGUAGES</b> keyword and list no languages, to skip enabling any languages.

       The variables set through the <b>VERSION</b>, <b>DESCRIPTION</b> and <b>HOMEPAGE_URL</b>  options  are  intended  for  use  as
       default values in package metadata and documentation.

   <b>Code</b> <b>Injection</b>
       A  number  of variables can be defined by the user to specify files to include at different points during
       the execution of the <b>project()</b> command.  The following outlines the steps performed  during  a  <b>project()</b>
       call:

       • Added in version 3.15: For every <b>project()</b> call regardless of the project name, include the file(s) and
         module(s) named by <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE</u>, if set.

       • Added  in  version 3.17: If the <b>project()</b> command specifies <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;</b> as its project name, include
         the file(s) and module(s) named by <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_INCLUDE_BEFORE</u>, if set.

       • Set the various project-specific variables detailed in the <u>Synopsis</u> and <u>Options</u> sections above.

       • For the very first <b>project()</b> call only:

         • If <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u> is set, read it at least once.  It may be read multiple times and it may also
           be read again when enabling languages later (see below).

         • Set the variables describing the host and target platforms.   Language-specific  variables  might  or
           might not be set at this point.  On the first run, the only language-specific variables that might be
           defined  are  those  a  toolchain  file may have set. On subsequent runs, language-specific variables
           cached from a previous run may be set.

         • Added in version 3.24: Include each file listed  in  <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES</u>,  if  set.  The
           variable is ignored by CMake thereafter.

       • Enable  any  languages  specified  in  the  call,  or  the default languages if none were provided. The
         toolchain file may be re-read when enabling a language for the first time.

       • Added in version 3.15: For every <b>project()</b> call regardless of the project name, include the file(s) and
         module(s) named by <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE</u>, if set.

       • If the <b>project()</b> command specifies  <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;</b>  as  its  project  name,  include  the  file(s)  and
         module(s) named by <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_INCLUDE</u>, if set.

   <b>Usage</b>
       The  top-level  <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>  file  for  a project must contain a literal, direct call to the <b>project()</b>
       command; loading one through the <u>include()</u> command is not sufficient.  If no such call exists, CMake will
       issue a warning and pretend there is a <b>project(Project)</b> at the top to enable the default languages (<b>C</b> and
       <b>CXX</b>).

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Call the  <b>project()</b>  command  near  the  top  of  the  top-level  <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>,  but  <u>after</u>  calling
          <u>cmake_minimum_required()</u>.   It  is  important to establish version and policy settings before invoking
          other commands whose behavior they may affect and for this reason the <b>project()</b> command will  issue  a
          warning if this order is not kept.  See also policy <u>CMP0000</u>.

   <b>remove_definitions</b>
       Remove -D define flags added by <u>add_definitions()</u>.

          remove_definitions(-DFOO -DBAR ...)

       Removes  flags  (added  by  <u>add_definitions()</u>)  from the compiler command line for sources in the current
       directory and below.

   <b>set_source_files_properties</b>
       Source files can have properties that affect how they are built.

          set_source_files_properties(&lt;files&gt; ...
                                      [DIRECTORY &lt;dirs&gt; ...]
                                      [TARGET_DIRECTORY &lt;targets&gt; ...]
                                      PROPERTIES &lt;prop1&gt; &lt;value1&gt;
                                      [&lt;prop2&gt; &lt;value2&gt;] ...)

       Sets properties associated with source files using a key/value paired list.

       Added in version 3.18: By default, source file properties are only visible to targets added in  the  same
       directory  (<b>CMakeLists.txt</b>).   Visibility  can  be set in other directory scopes using one or both of the
       following options:

       <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;dirs&gt;...</b>
              The source file properties will be set in each of the  <b>&lt;dirs&gt;</b>  directories'  scopes.   CMake  must
              already know about each of these source directories, either by having added them through a call to
              <u>add_subdirectory()</u>  or  it  being  the  top level source directory.  Relative paths are treated as
              relative to the current source directory.

       <b>TARGET_DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;targets&gt;...</b>
              The source file properties will be set in each of the directory scopes where any of the  specified
              <b>&lt;targets&gt;</b> were created (the <b>&lt;targets&gt;</b> must therefore already exist).

       Use <u>get_source_file_property()</u> to get property values.  See also the <u>set_property(SOURCE)</u> command.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The <u>GENERATED</u> source file property may be globally visible.  See its documentation for details.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • <u>define_property()</u>

       • <u>get_source_file_property()</u>

       • <u>Properties</u> <u>on</u> <u>Source</u> <u>Files</u> for the list of properties known to CMake

   <b>set_target_properties</b>
       Targets can have properties that affect how they are built.

          set_target_properties(&lt;targets&gt; ...
                                PROPERTIES &lt;prop1&gt; &lt;value1&gt;
                                [&lt;prop2&gt; &lt;value2&gt;] ...)

       Sets  properties  on  targets.  The syntax for the command is to list all the targets you want to change,
       and then provide the values you want to set next.  You can use any prop value pair you want  and  extract
       it later with the <u>get_property()</u> or <u>get_target_property()</u> command.

       <u>Alias</u> <u>Targets</u> do not support setting target properties.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • <u>define_property()</u>

       • <u>get_target_property()</u>

       • the more general <u>set_property()</u> command

       • <u>Properties</u> <u>on</u> <u>Targets</u> for the list of properties known to CMake

   <b>set_tests_properties</b>
       Set a property of the tests.

          set_tests_properties(&lt;tests&gt;...
                               [DIRECTORY &lt;dir&gt;]
                               PROPERTIES &lt;prop1&gt; &lt;value1&gt;
                               [&lt;prop2&gt; &lt;value2&gt;]...)

       Sets a property for the tests.  If the test is not found, CMake will report an error.

       Test property values may be specified using <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> for tests created by the <u>add_test(NAME)</u>
       signature.

       Added in version 3.28: Visibility can be set in other directory scopes using the following option:

       <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              The  test  properties  will  be set in the <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> directory's scope.  CMake must already know about
              this directory, either by having added it through a call to <u>add_subdirectory()</u> or it being the top
              level source directory. Relative paths are treated as relative to the  current  source  directory.
              <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> may reference a binary directory.

       • <u>define_property()</u>

       • <u>Properties</u> <u>on</u> <u>Tests</u> for the list of properties known to CMake

   <b>source_group</b>
       Define  a  grouping  for  source  files in IDE project generation.  There are two different signatures to
       create source groups.

          source_group(&lt;name&gt; [FILES &lt;src&gt;...] [REGULAR_EXPRESSION &lt;regex&gt;])
          source_group(TREE &lt;root&gt; [PREFIX &lt;prefix&gt;] [FILES &lt;src&gt;...])

       Defines a group into which sources will be placed in project files.  This is intended to set up file tabs
       in Visual Studio.  The group is scoped in the directory where the  command  is  called,  and  applies  to
       sources in targets created in that directory.

       The options are:

       <b>TREE</b>   Added in version 3.8.

              CMake will automatically detect, from <b>&lt;src&gt;</b> files paths, source groups it needs to create, to keep
              structure  of  source  groups  analogically  to  the actual files and directories structure in the
              project. Paths of <b>&lt;src&gt;</b> files will be cut to be relative to <b>&lt;root&gt;</b>. The command fails if the paths
              within <b>src</b> do not start with <b>root</b>.

       <b>PREFIX</b> Added in version 3.8.

              Source group and files located directly in <b>&lt;root&gt;</b> path, will be placed in <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b> source groups.

       <b>FILES</b>  Any source file specified  explicitly  will  be  placed  in  group  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>.   Relative  paths  are
              interpreted with respect to the current source directory.

       <b>REGULAR_EXPRESSION</b>
              Any source file whose name matches the regular expression will be placed in group <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>.

       If  a  source file matches multiple groups, the <u>last</u> group that explicitly lists the file with <b>FILES</b> will
       be favored, if any.  If no group explicitly lists the file,  the  <u>last</u>  group  whose  regular  expression
       matches the file will be favored.

       The  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>  of  the  group  and  <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b> argument may contain forward slashes or backslashes to specify
       subgroups.  Backslashes need to be escaped appropriately:

          source_group(base/subdir ...)
          source_group(outer\\inner ...)
          source_group(TREE &lt;root&gt; PREFIX sources\\inc ...)

       Added in version 3.18: Allow using forward slashes (<b>/</b>) to specify subgroups.

       For backwards compatibility, the short-hand signature

          source_group(&lt;name&gt; &lt;regex&gt;)

       is equivalent to

          source_group(&lt;name&gt; REGULAR_EXPRESSION &lt;regex&gt;)

   <b>target_compile_definitions</b>
       Add compile definitions to a target.

          target_compile_definitions(&lt;target&gt;
            &lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; [items1...]
            [&lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; [items2...] ...])

       Specifies compile definitions to use when compiling a given <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>.  The named <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> must have  been
       created by a command such as <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u> and must not be an <u>ALIAS</u> <u>target</u>.

       The  <b>INTERFACE</b>, <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>PRIVATE</b> keywords are required to specify the <u>scope</u> of the following arguments.
       <b>PRIVATE</b> and <b>PUBLIC</b> items will populate the <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u> property of <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>. <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b>
       items will populate the <u>INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u> property  of  <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>.   The  following  arguments
       specify compile definitions.  Repeated calls for the same <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> append items in the order called.

       Added in version 3.11: Allow setting <b>INTERFACE</b> items on <u>IMPORTED</u> <u>targets</u>.

       Arguments  to  <b>target_compile_definitions</b>  may  use generator expressions with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>. See the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

       Any leading <b>-D</b> on an item will be removed.  Empty items are ignored.  For example, the following are  all
       equivalent:

          target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC FOO)
          target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC -DFOO)  # -D removed
          target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC "" FOO) # "" ignored
          target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC -D FOO) # -D becomes "", then ignored

       Definitions may optionally have values:

          target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC FOO=1)

       Note  that many compilers treat <b>-DFOO</b> as equivalent to <b>-DFOO=1</b>, but other tools may not recognize this in
       all circumstances (e.g. IntelliSense).

   <b>target_compile_features</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Add expected compiler features to a target.

          target_compile_features(&lt;target&gt; &lt;PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE&gt; &lt;feature&gt; [...])

       Specifies compiler features required when compiling a given target.  If the feature is not listed in  the
       <u>CMAKE_C_COMPILE_FEATURES</u>,  <u>CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILE_FEATURES</u>,  or <u>CMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_FEATURES</u> variables, then an
       error will be reported by CMake.  If the use of the feature requires an additional compiler flag, such as
       <b>-std=gnu++11</b>, the flag will be added automatically.

       The <b>INTERFACE</b>, <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>PRIVATE</b> keywords are required to specify the scope of  the  features.   <b>PRIVATE</b>
       and  <b>PUBLIC</b>  items  will  populate the <u>COMPILE_FEATURES</u> property of <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>.  <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b> items
       will populate the <u>INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES</u> property of <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>.  Repeated calls for the same  <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>
       append items.

       Added in version 3.11: Allow setting <b>INTERFACE</b> items on <u>IMPORTED</u> <u>targets</u>.

       The named <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> must have been created by a command such as <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u> and must
       not be an <u>ALIAS</u> <u>target</u>.

       Adds  options  to  the  <u>COMPILE_OPTIONS</u> or <u>INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS</u> target properties. These options are
       used  when  compiling  the  given  <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>,  which  must  have  been  created  by  a  command  such   as
       <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u> and must not be an <u>ALIAS</u> <u>target</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          These options are not used when linking the target.  See the <u>target_link_options()</u> command for that.

   <b>Arguments</b>
       If  <b>BEFORE</b>  is  specified,  the content will be prepended to the property instead of being appended.  See
       policy <u>CMP0101</u> which affects whether <b>BEFORE</b> will be ignored in certain cases.

       The <b>INTERFACE</b>, <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>PRIVATE</b> keywords are required to specify the <u>scope</u> of the following  arguments.
       <b>PRIVATE</b>  and  <b>PUBLIC</b>  items will populate the <u>COMPILE_OPTIONS</u> property of <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>.  <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b>
       items will populate the <u>INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS</u> property of <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>.  The following arguments  specify
       compile options.  Repeated calls for the same <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> append items in the order called.

       Added in version 3.11: Allow setting <b>INTERFACE</b> items on <u>IMPORTED</u> <u>targets</u>.

       Arguments  to  <b>target_compile_options</b>  may  use  generator  expressions  with  the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>. See the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>Option</b> <b>De-duplication</b>
       The final set of options used for a target is constructed by accumulating options from the current target
       and the usage requirements of its dependencies.  The set of options is de-duplicated to avoid repetition.

       Added in version 3.12: While beneficial for individual options, the  de-duplication  step  can  break  up
       option groups.  For example, <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>-option</b> <b>B</b> becomes <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>B</b>.  One may specify a group of options
       using  shell-like  quoting along with a <b>SHELL:</b> prefix.  The <b>SHELL:</b> prefix is dropped, and the rest of the
       option string is parsed using the <u>separate_arguments()</u> <b>UNIX_COMMAND</b> mode. For example, <b>"SHELL:-option</b>  <b>A"</b>
       <b>"SHELL:-option</b> <b>B"</b> becomes <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>-option</b> <b>B</b>.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • This  command  can be used to add any options. However, for adding preprocessor definitions and include
         directories it is recommended to  use  the  more  specific  commands  <u>target_compile_definitions()</u>  and

   <b>target_include_directories</b>
       Add include directories to a target.

          target_include_directories(&lt;target&gt; [SYSTEM] [AFTER|BEFORE]
            &lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; [items1...]
            [&lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; [items2...] ...])

       Specifies include directories to use when compiling a given target.  The named <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>  must  have  been
       created by a command such as <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u> and must not be an <u>ALIAS</u> <u>target</u>.

       By  using <b>AFTER</b> or <b>BEFORE</b> explicitly, you can select between appending and prepending, independent of the
       default.

       The <b>INTERFACE</b>, <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>PRIVATE</b> keywords are required to specify the <u>scope</u> of the following  arguments.
       <b>PRIVATE</b> and <b>PUBLIC</b> items will populate the <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> property of <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>. <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b>
       items  will  populate  the  <u>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>  property of <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>.  The following arguments
       specify include directories.

       Added in version 3.11: Allow setting <b>INTERFACE</b> items on <u>IMPORTED</u> <u>targets</u>.

       Repeated calls for the same <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> append items in the order called.

       If <b>SYSTEM</b> is specified, the compiler will be told the directories are meant as system include directories
       on some platforms.  This may have effects such as suppressing warnings or skipping the contained  headers
       in  dependency  calculations  (see compiler documentation).  Additionally, system include directories are
       searched after normal include directories regardless of the order specified.

       If <b>SYSTEM</b> is used together with <b>PUBLIC</b>  or  <b>INTERFACE</b>,  the  <u>INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>  target
       property will be populated with the specified directories.

       Arguments  to  <b>target_include_directories</b>  may  use generator expressions with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>. See the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

       Specified include directories may be  absolute  paths  or  relative  paths.   A  relative  path  will  be
       interpreted  as relative to the current source directory (i.e. <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>) and converted to
       an absolute path before storing it in the  associated  target  property.   If  the  path  starts  with  a
       generator  expression,  it will always be assumed to be an absolute path (with one exception noted below)
       and will be used unmodified.

       Include directories usage requirements commonly differ between the build-tree and the install-tree.   The
       <u>BUILD_INTERFACE</u>  and  <u>INSTALL_INTERFACE</u>  generator  expressions  can  be  used to describe separate usage
       requirements based on the usage location.   Relative  paths  are  allowed  within  the  <u>INSTALL_INTERFACE</u>
       expression and are interpreted as relative to the installation prefix.  Relative paths should not be used
       in <u>BUILD_INTERFACE</u> expressions because they will not be converted to absolute.  For example:

          target_include_directories(mylib PUBLIC
            $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/mylib&gt;
            $&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/mylib&gt;  # &lt;prefix&gt;/include/mylib
          )

   <b>Creating</b> <b>Relocatable</b> <b>Packages</b>
       Note that it is not advisable to populate the <u>INSTALL_INTERFACE</u> of the <u>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> of a
       target  with  absolute  paths  to  the  include  directories  of dependencies.  That would hard-code into
       installed packages the include directory paths for dependencies <b>as</b> <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>the</b>  <b>package</b>  <b>was</b>
       <b>made</b> <b>on</b>.

       The  <u>INSTALL_INTERFACE</u>  of the <u>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> is only suitable for specifying the required
       include directories for headers provided with the target itself, not those  provided  by  the  transitive
       dependencies   listed  in  its  <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>  target  property.   Those  dependencies  should
       themselves be targets that specify their own header locations in <u>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>.

       See the <u>Creating</u>  <u>Relocatable</u>  <u>Packages</u>  section  of  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-packages.7.html">cmake-packages</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  discussion  of
       additional  care  that  must  be  taken  when  specifying  usage requirements while creating packages for
       redistribution.

       Specifies the paths in which the linker should search for libraries when linking a  given  target.   Each
       item  can  be  an absolute or relative path, with the latter being interpreted as relative to the current
       source directory.  These items will be added to the link command.

       The named <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> must have been created by a command such as <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u> and must
       not be an <u>ALIAS</u> <u>target</u>.

       The <b>INTERFACE</b>, <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>PRIVATE</b> keywords are required to specify the <u>scope</u> of  the  items  that  follow

       <b>INTERFACE</b> items will populate the <u>INTERFACE_LINK_DIRECTORIES</u> property of <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> (<u>IMPORTED</u> <u>targets</u>  only
       support <b>INTERFACE</b> items).  Each item specifies a link directory and will be converted to an absolute path
       if  necessary  before  adding  it  to the relevant property.  Repeated calls for the same <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> append
       items in the order called.

       If <b>BEFORE</b> is specified, the content will be prepended to the relevant property instead of being appended.

       Arguments to <b>target_link_directories</b> may use generator  expressions  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See  the

       more on defining buildsystem properties.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This  command is rarely necessary and should be avoided where there are other choices.  Prefer to pass
          full absolute paths to libraries where possible, since this ensures the correct library will always be
          linked.  The <u>find_library()</u> command provides the full path, which can generally be  used  directly  in
          calls to <u>target_link_libraries()</u>.  Situations where a library search path may be needed include:

          • Project  generators  like  Xcode  where the user can switch target architecture at build time, but a
            full path to a library cannot be used because it only provides one architecture (i.e. it  is  not  a
            universal binary).

          • Libraries  may  themselves have other private library dependencies that expect to be found via <b>RPATH</b>
            mechanisms, but some linkers are not able to fully decode those paths (e.g. due to the  presence  of
            things like <b>$ORIGIN</b>).

   <b>target_link_libraries</b>
       Specify  libraries or flags to use when linking a given target and/or its dependents.  <u>Usage</u> <u>requirements</u>
       from linked library targets will be propagated.  Usage requirements of  a  target's  dependencies  affect
       compilation of its own sources.

   <b>Overview</b>
       This command has several signatures as detailed in subsections below.  All of them have the general form

          target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt; ... &lt;item&gt;... ...)

       The named <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> must have been created by a command such as <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u> and must
       not  be  an  <u>ALIAS</u> <u>target</u>.  If policy <u>CMP0079</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b> then the target must have been created in
       the current directory.  Repeated calls for the same <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> append items in the order called.

       Added in version  3.13:  The  <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>  doesn't  have  to  be  defined  in  the  same  directory  as  the
       <b>target_link_libraries</b> call.

       Each <b>&lt;item&gt;</b> may be:

       • <b>A</b>  <b>library</b>  <b>target</b>  <b>name</b>:  The generated link line will have the full path to the linkable library file
         associated with the target.  The buildsystem will have a dependency to re-link <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> if the  library
         file changes.

         The  named target must be created by <u>add_library()</u> within the project or as an <u>IMPORTED</u> <u>library</u>.  If it
         is created within the project an ordering dependency will automatically be added in the build system to
         make sure the named library target is up-to-date before the <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> links.

         If an imported library has the <u>IMPORTED_NO_SONAME</u> target property set, CMake  may  ask  the  linker  to
         search for the library instead of using the full path (e.g. <b>/usr/lib/libfoo.so</b> becomes <b>-lfoo</b>).

         The full path to the target's artifact will be quoted/escaped for the shell automatically.

       • <b>A</b>  <b>full</b>  <b>path</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>a</b>  <b>library</b> <b>file</b>: The generated link line will normally preserve the full path to the
         file. The buildsystem will have a dependency to re-link <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> if the library file changes.

         There are some cases where CMake may ask the linker to search for the library (e.g.  <b>/usr/lib/libfoo.so</b>
         becomes  <b>-lfoo</b>), such as when a shared library is detected to have no <b>SONAME</b> field.  See policy <u>CMP0060</u>
         for discussion of another case.

         If the library file is in a macOS framework, the <b>Headers</b>  directory  of  the  framework  will  also  be
         processed  as  a  <u>usage</u> <u>requirement</u>.  This has the same effect as passing the framework directory as an
         include directory.

         Added in version 3.28: The library file may point to a <b>.xcframework</b> folder on Apple platforms.   If  it
         does, the target will get the selected library's <b>Headers</b> directory as a usage requirement.

         Added  in  version  3.8:  On  <u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u> for VS 2010 and above, library files ending in
         <b>.targets</b> will be treated as MSBuild targets files and imported into generated project files.   This  is
         not supported by other generators.

         The full path to the library file will be quoted/escaped for the shell automatically.

       • <b>A</b>  <b>plain</b>  <b>library</b> <b>name</b>: The generated link line will ask the linker to search for the library (e.g. <b>foo</b>
         becomes <b>-lfoo</b> or <b>foo.lib</b>).

         The library name/flag is treated as a command-line string fragment and  will  be  used  with  no  extra
         quoting or escaping.

       • <b>A</b>  <b>link</b>  <b>flag</b>: Item names starting with <b>-</b>, but not <b>-l</b> or <b>-framework</b>, are treated as linker flags.  Note
         that such flags will  be  treated  like  any  other  library  link  item  for  purposes  of  transitive
         dependencies,  so they are generally safe to specify only as private link items that will not propagate
         to dependents.

         Link flags specified here are inserted into the link command in the same place as the  link  libraries.
         This  might  not  be  correct,  depending  on  the  linker.  Use  the  <u>LINK_OPTIONS</u>  target property or
         <u>target_link_options()</u> command to add link flags explicitly. The  flags  will  then  be  placed  at  the
         toolchain-defined flag position in the link command.

         Added  in  version  3.13:  <u>LINK_OPTIONS</u> target property and <u>target_link_options()</u> command.  For earlier
         versions of CMake, use <u>LINK_FLAGS</u> property instead.

         The link flag is treated as a command-line string fragment and will be used with no  extra  quoting  or
         escaping.

       • <b>A</b>  <b>generator</b>  <b>expression</b>:  A <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b> <u>generator</u> <u>expression</u> may evaluate to any of the above items or to a
         <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of them.  If the <b>...</b> contains any <b>;</b> characters, e.g.  after  evaluation  of  a
         <b>${list}</b>  variable,  be sure to use an explicitly quoted argument <b>"$&lt;...&gt;"</b> so that this command receives
         it as a single <b>&lt;item&gt;</b>.

         Additionally, a generator expression may be used as  a  fragment  of  any  of  the  above  items,  e.g.
         <b>foo$&lt;1:_d&gt;</b>.

         Note that generator expressions will not be used in OLD handling of policy <u>CMP0003</u> or policy <u>CMP0004</u>.

       • A <b>debug</b>, <b>optimized</b>, or <b>general</b> keyword immediately followed by another <b>&lt;item&gt;</b>.  The item following such
         a  keyword  will be used only for the corresponding build configuration.  The <b>debug</b> keyword corresponds
         to the <b>Debug</b> configuration (or to configurations named in the <u>DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS</u> global  property  if
         it  is  set).   The  <b>optimized</b>  keyword  corresponds  to all other configurations.  The <b>general</b> keyword
         corresponds to all configurations, and is purely optional.  Higher  granularity  may  be  achieved  for
         per-configuration  rules  by  creating  and  linking  to  <u>IMPORTED</u> <u>library</u> <u>targets</u>.  These keywords are
         interpreted immediately by this command and therefore have  no  special  meaning  when  produced  by  a
         generator expression.

       Items  containing <b>::</b>, such as <b>Foo::Bar</b>, are assumed to be <u>IMPORTED</u> or <u>ALIAS</u> library target names and will
       cause an error if no such target exists.  See policy <u>CMP0028</u>.

       See the <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARIES_STRATEGY</u> variable and corresponding <u>LINK_LIBRARIES_STRATEGY</u> target  property
       for details on how CMake orders direct link dependencies on linker command lines.

                                &lt;PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE&gt; &lt;item&gt;...
                               [&lt;PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE&gt; &lt;item&gt;...]...)

       The  <b>PUBLIC</b>,  <b>PRIVATE</b>  and <b>INTERFACE</b> <u>scope</u> keywords can be used to specify both the link dependencies and
       the link interface in one command.

       Libraries and targets following <b>PUBLIC</b> are linked to, and are made part of the link interface.  Libraries
       and targets following <b>PRIVATE</b> are linked to, but are not made part  of  the  link  interface.   Libraries
       following <b>INTERFACE</b> are appended to the link interface and are not used for linking <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>.

   <b>Libraries</b> <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>a</b> <b>Target</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>Dependents</b>
          target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt; &lt;item&gt;...)

       Library  dependencies  are  transitive  by  default with this signature.  When this target is linked into
       another target then the libraries linked to this target will appear on the link line for the other target
       too.  This transitive "link interface" is stored in the <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> target property and  may
       be  overridden  by  setting the property directly.  When <u>CMP0022</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b>, transitive linking is
       built in but may be overridden by the <u>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</u> property.  Calls to  other  signatures  of
       this command may set the property making any libraries linked exclusively by this signature private.

   <b>Libraries</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Target</b> <b>and/or</b> <b>its</b> <b>Dependents</b> <b>(Legacy)</b>
          target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt;
                                &lt;LINK_PRIVATE|LINK_PUBLIC&gt; &lt;lib&gt;...
                               [&lt;LINK_PRIVATE|LINK_PUBLIC&gt; &lt;lib&gt;...]...)

       The  <b>LINK_PUBLIC</b>  and  <b>LINK_PRIVATE</b>  modes can be used to specify both the link dependencies and the link
       interface in one command.

       This signature is for compatibility only.  Prefer the <b>PUBLIC</b> or <b>PRIVATE</b> keywords instead.

       Libraries  and  targets  following  <b>LINK_PUBLIC</b>   are   linked   to,   and   are   made   part   of   the
       <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>.    If   policy   <u>CMP0022</u>   is   not  <b>NEW</b>,  they  are  also  made  part  of  the
       <u>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</u>.  Libraries and targets following <b>LINK_PRIVATE</b> are linked to, but are  not  made
       part of the <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> (or <u>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</u>).

   <b>Libraries</b> <b>for</b> <b>Dependents</b> <b>Only</b> <b>(Legacy)</b>
          target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt; LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES &lt;item&gt;...)

       The  <b>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</b>  mode appends the libraries to the <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> target property
       instead of using them for linking.  If policy <u>CMP0022</u> is not <b>NEW</b>, then this mode also  appends  libraries
       to the <u>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</u> and its per-configuration equivalent.

       This signature is for compatibility only.  Prefer the <b>INTERFACE</b> mode instead.

       Libraries  specified  as  <b>debug</b>  are wrapped in a generator expression to correspond to debug builds.  If
       policy <u>CMP0022</u> is not <b>NEW</b>, the libraries are also appended to the <u>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_DEBUG</u> property
       (or to the properties corresponding to configurations listed in the <u>DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS</u> global  property
       if  it  is set).  Libraries specified as <b>optimized</b> are appended to the <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> property.
       If policy <u>CMP0022</u> is not <b>NEW</b>, they are also appended to the <u>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</u> property.  Libraries
       specified as <b>general</b> (or without any keyword) are treated as if specified for both <b>debug</b> and <b>optimized</b>.

   <b>Linking</b> <b>Object</b> <b>Libraries</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       <u>Object</u> <u>Libraries</u> may be used as  the  <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>  (first)  argument  of  <b>target_link_libraries</b>  to  specify
       dependencies of their sources on other libraries.  For example, the code

          add_library(A SHARED a.c)
          target_compile_definitions(A PUBLIC A)

          add_library(obj OBJECT obj.c)
          target_compile_definitions(obj PUBLIC OBJ)
          target_link_libraries(obj PUBLIC A)

       compiles  <b>obj.c</b>  with  <b>-DA</b>  <b>-DOBJ</b>  and  establishes  usage  requirements  for  <b>obj</b>  that propagate to its
       dependents.

       Normal libraries  and  executables  may  link  to  <u>Object</u>  <u>Libraries</u>  to  get  their  objects  and  usage
       requirements.  Continuing the above example, the code

          add_library(B SHARED b.c)
          target_link_libraries(B PUBLIC obj)

       compiles  <b>b.c</b>  with <b>-DA</b> <b>-DOBJ</b>, creates shared library <b>B</b> with object files from <b>b.c</b> and <b>obj.c</b>, and links <b>B</b>
       to <b>A</b>.  Furthermore, the code

          add_executable(main main.c)
          target_link_libraries(main B)

       compiles <b>main.c</b> with <b>-DA</b> <b>-DOBJ</b> and links executable  <b>main</b>  to  <b>B</b>  and  <b>A</b>.   The  object  library's  usage
       requirements are propagated transitively through <b>B</b>, but its object files are not.

       <u>Object</u>  <u>Libraries</u>  may  "link" to other object libraries to get usage requirements, but since they do not
       have a link step nothing is done with their object files.  Continuing from the above example, the code:

          add_library(obj2 OBJECT obj2.c)
          target_link_libraries(obj2 PUBLIC obj)

          add_executable(main2 main2.c)
          target_link_libraries(main2 obj2)

       compiles <b>obj2.c</b> with <b>-DA</b> <b>-DOBJ</b>, creates executable <b>main2</b> with object files from <b>main2.c</b> and  <b>obj2.c</b>,  and
       links <b>main2</b> to <b>A</b>.

       In other words, when <u>Object</u> <u>Libraries</u> appear in a target's <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> property they will be
       treated  as  <u>Interface</u> <u>Libraries</u>, but when they appear in a target's <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u> property their object
       files will be included in the link too.

   <b>Linking</b> <b>Object</b> <b>Libraries</b> <b>via</b> <b>$&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       The object files associated with an object library may be referenced by the  <u>$&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS&gt;</u>  generator
       expression.   Such  object  files  are  placed on the link line <u>before</u> all libraries, regardless of their
       relative order.  Additionally, an ordering dependency will be added to the build system to make sure  the
       object library is up-to-date before the dependent target links.  For example, the code

          add_library(obj3 OBJECT obj3.c)
          target_compile_definitions(obj3 PUBLIC OBJ3)

          add_executable(main3 main3.c)
          target_link_libraries(main3 PRIVATE a3 $&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:obj3&gt; b3)

       links  executable  <b>main3</b>  with  object files from <b>main3.c</b> and <b>obj3.c</b> followed by the <b>a3</b> and <b>b3</b> libraries.
       <b>main3.c</b> is <u>not</u> compiled with usage requirements from <b>obj3</b>, such as <b>-DOBJ3</b>.

       This approach can be used to achieve transitive  inclusion  of  object  files  in  link  lines  as  usage
       requirements.  Continuing the above example, the code

          add_library(iface_obj3 INTERFACE)
          target_link_libraries(iface_obj3 INTERFACE obj3 $&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:obj3&gt;)

       creates  an  interface  library  <b>iface_obj3</b>  that  forwards the <b>obj3</b> usage requirements and adds the <b>obj3</b>
       object files to dependents' link lines.  The code

          add_executable(use_obj3 use_obj3.c)
          target_link_libraries(use_obj3 PRIVATE iface_obj3)

       compiles <b>use_obj3.c</b> with <b>-DOBJ3</b> and links executable <b>use_obj3</b>  with  object  files  from  <b>use_obj3.c</b>  and
       <b>obj3.c</b>.

       This also works transitively through a static library.  Since a static library does not link, it does not
       consume  the  object  files  from object libraries referenced this way.  Instead, the object files become
       transitive link dependencies of the static library.  Continuing the above example, the code

          add_library(static3 STATIC static3.c)
          target_link_libraries(static3 PRIVATE iface_obj3)

          add_executable(use_static3 use_static3.c)
          target_link_libraries(use_static3 PRIVATE static3)

       compiles <b>static3.c</b> with <b>-DOBJ3</b> and creates <b>libstatic3.a</b> using only its own object file.  <b>use_static3.c</b> is
       compiled <u>without</u> <b>-DOBJ3</b> because the usage requirement is not transitive through the private dependency of
       <b>static3</b>.  However, the link dependencies of <b>static3</b> are propagated, including the <b>iface_obj3</b> reference to
       <b>$&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:obj3&gt;</b>.  The <b>use_static3</b> executable is created with object files from  <b>use_static3.c</b>  and
       <b>obj3.c</b>, and linked to library <b>libstatic3.a</b>.

       When using this approach, it is the project's responsibility to avoid linking multiple dependent binaries
       to <b>iface_obj3</b>, because they will all get the <b>obj3</b> object files on their link lines.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Referencing <u>$&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS&gt;</u> in <b>target_link_libraries</b> calls worked in versions of CMake prior to 3.21
          for some cases, but was not fully supported:

          • It did not place the object files before libraries on link lines.

          • It did not add an ordering dependency on the object library.

          • It did not work in Xcode with multiple architectures.

   <b>Cyclic</b> <b>Dependencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>Static</b> <b>Libraries</b>
       The  library  dependency  graph is normally acyclic (a DAG), but in the case of mutually-dependent <b>STATIC</b>
       libraries CMake allows the graph to contain cycles (strongly connected components).  When another  target
       links to one of the libraries, CMake repeats the entire connected component.  For example, the code

          add_library(A STATIC a.c)
          add_library(B STATIC b.c)
          target_link_libraries(A B)
          target_link_libraries(B A)
          add_executable(main main.c)
          target_link_libraries(main A)

       links  <b>main</b>  to <b>A</b> <b>B</b> <b>A</b> <b>B</b>.  While one repetition is usually sufficient, pathological object file and symbol
       arrangements can require more.  One may handle such cases by using the <u>LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY</u> target
       property or by manually repeating the component in the last <b>target_link_libraries</b> call.  However, if  two
       archives  are really so interdependent they should probably be combined into a single archive, perhaps by
       using <u>Object</u> <u>Libraries</u>.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>Relocatable</b> <b>Packages</b>
       Note that it is not advisable to populate the <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> of a target with absolute paths to
       dependencies.  That would hard-code into installed packages the library file paths  for  dependencies  <b>as</b>
       <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>the</b> <b>package</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b>.

       See  the  <u>Creating</u>  <u>Relocatable</u>  <u>Packages</u>  section  of  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-packages.7.html">cmake-packages</a>(7)</u>  manual  for discussion of
       additional care that must be taken  when  specifying  usage  requirements  while  creating  packages  for
       redistribution.

   <b>target_link_options</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       Add options to the link step for an executable, shared library or module library target.

          target_link_options(&lt;target&gt; [BEFORE]
            &lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; [items1...]
            [&lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; [items2...] ...])

       The named <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> must have been created by a command such as <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u> and must
       not be an <u>ALIAS</u> <u>target</u>.

       This  command  can  be  used  to add any link options, but alternative commands exist to add libraries (‐
       <u>target_link_libraries()</u> or <u>link_libraries()</u>).  See documentation of the <u>directory</u> and <u>target</u> <b>LINK_OPTIONS</b>
       properties.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This command cannot be used to add options for static library targets, since they do not use a linker.
          To add archiver or MSVC librarian flags, see the <u>STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS</u> target property.

       If <b>BEFORE</b> is specified, the content will be prepended to the property instead of being appended.

       The <b>INTERFACE</b>, <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>PRIVATE</b> keywords are required to specify the <u>scope</u> of the following  arguments.
       <b>PRIVATE</b> and <b>PUBLIC</b> items will populate the <u>LINK_OPTIONS</u> property of <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>.  <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b> items
       will  populate  the  <u>INTERFACE_LINK_OPTIONS</u>  property  of <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>.  The following arguments specify link
       options.  Repeated calls for the same <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> append items in the order called.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          <u>IMPORTED</u> <u>targets</u> only support <b>INTERFACE</b> items.

       Arguments to  <b>target_link_options</b>  may  use  generator  expressions  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See  the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>Host</b> <b>And</b> <b>Device</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Options</b>
       Added   in   version   3.18:   When   a   device   link   step   is  involved,  which  is  controlled  by
       <u>CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION</u> and <u>CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS</u> properties and policy <u>CMP0105</u>, the raw options
       will be delivered to the host and device link steps (wrapped  in  <b>-Xcompiler</b>  or  equivalent  for  device
       link). Options wrapped with <u>$&lt;DEVICE_LINK:...&gt;</u> generator expression will be used only for the device link
       step.  Options  wrapped  with  <u>$&lt;HOST_LINK:...&gt;</u>  generator expression will be used only for the host link
       step.

   <b>Option</b> <b>De-duplication</b>
       The final set of options used for a target is constructed by accumulating options from the current target
       and the usage requirements of its dependencies.  The set of options is de-duplicated to avoid repetition.

       Added in version 3.12: While beneficial for individual options, the  de-duplication  step  can  break  up
       option groups.  For example, <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>-option</b> <b>B</b> becomes <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>B</b>.  One may specify a group of options
       using  shell-like  quoting along with a <b>SHELL:</b> prefix.  The <b>SHELL:</b> prefix is dropped, and the rest of the
       option string is parsed using the <u>separate_arguments()</u> <b>UNIX_COMMAND</b> mode. For example, <b>"SHELL:-option</b>  <b>A"</b>
       <b>"SHELL:-option</b> <b>B"</b> becomes <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>-option</b> <b>B</b>.

   <b>Handling</b> <b>Compiler</b> <b>Driver</b> <b>Differences</b>
       To  pass  options  to the linker tool, each compiler driver has its own syntax.  The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix and <b>,</b>
       separator can be used to specify, in a portable way, options to pass  to  the  linker  tool.  <b>LINKER:</b>  is
       replaced  by  the appropriate driver option and <b>,</b> by the appropriate driver separator.  The driver prefix
       and  driver  separator  are  given  by   the   values   of   the   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG</u>   and
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP</u> variables.

       For example, <b>"LINKER:-z,defs"</b> becomes <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>-z</b> <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>defs</b> for <b>Clang</b> and <b>-Wl,-z,defs</b> for <b>GNU</b> <b>GCC</b>.

       The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix can be specified as part of a <b>SHELL:</b> prefix expression.

       The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix supports, as an alternative syntax, specification of arguments using the <b>SHELL:</b> prefix
       and space as separator. The previous example then becomes <b>"LINKER:SHELL:-z</b> <b>defs"</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Specifying  the  <b>SHELL:</b>  prefix  anywhere  other  than  at  the beginning of the <b>LINKER:</b> prefix is not
          supported.

   <b>target_precompile_headers</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Add a list of header files to precompile.

       Precompiling header files can speed up compilation by creating a  partially  processed  version  of  some
       header files, and then using that version during compilations rather than repeatedly parsing the original
       headers.

   <b>Main</b> <b>Form</b>
          target_precompile_headers(&lt;target&gt;
            &lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; [header1...]
            [&lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; [header2...] ...])

       The  command  adds  header  files  to  the  <u>PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</u> and/or <u>INTERFACE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</u> target
       properties of <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>.  The named <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> must have been created by a command such as  <u>add_executable()</u>
       or <u>add_library()</u> and must not be an <u>ALIAS</u> <u>target</u>.

       The  <b>INTERFACE</b>, <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>PRIVATE</b> keywords are required to specify the <u>scope</u> of the following arguments.
       <b>PRIVATE</b> and <b>PUBLIC</b> items will populate the <u>PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</u> property of <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>.  <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b>
       items will populate the <u>INTERFACE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</u> property of <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> (<u>IMPORTED</u> <u>targets</u> only  support
       <b>INTERFACE</b> items).  Repeated calls for the same <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> will append items in the order called.

       Projects  should  generally  avoid  using  <b>PUBLIC</b> or <b>INTERFACE</b> for targets that will be <u>exported</u>, or they
       should at least use the <u>$&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt;</u> generator expression to prevent  precompile  headers  from
       appearing  in an installed exported target.  Consumers of a target should typically be in control of what
       precompile headers they use, not have precompile headers forced on them by  the  targets  being  consumed
       (since precompile headers are not typically usage requirements).  A notable exception to this is where an
       <u>interface</u>  <u>library</u>  is  created to define a commonly used set of precompile headers in one place and then
       other targets link to that interface library privately.  In  this  case,  the  interface  library  exists
       specifically  to  propagate the precompile headers to its consumers and the consumer is effectively still
       in control, since it decides whether to link to the interface library or not.

       The list of header files is used to generate a header file named <b>cmake_pch.h|xx</b> which is used to generate
       the precompiled header file (<b>.pch</b>, <b>.gch</b>, <b>.pchi</b>) artifact.  The <b>cmake_pch.h|xx</b> header file will  be  force
       included  (<b>-include</b>  for  GCC, <b>/FI</b> for MSVC) to all source files, so sources do not need to have <b>#include</b>
       <b>"pch.h"</b>.

       Header file names specified with angle brackets (e.g. <b>&lt;unordered_map&gt;</b>) or explicit double quotes (escaped
       for the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-language.7.html">cmake-language</a>(7)</u>, e.g. <b>[["other_header.h"]]</b>) will be treated as is, and include directories must
       be available for the compiler to  find  them.   Other  header  file  names  (e.g.  <b>project_header.h</b>)  are
       interpreted as being relative to the current source directory (e.g. <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>) and will be
       included by absolute path.  For example:

          target_precompile_headers(myTarget
            PUBLIC
              project_header.h
            PRIVATE
              [["other_header.h"]]
              &lt;unordered_map&gt;
          )
          for more on defining buildsystem properties.

       Arguments  to  <b>target_precompile_headers</b>  may  use  generator expressions with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>. See the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  The  <u>$&lt;COMPILE_LANGUAGE:...&gt;</u>  generator
       expression  is  particularly  useful for specifying a language-specific header to precompile for only one
       language (e.g. <b>CXX</b> and not <b>C</b>).  In this case, header file names that are not explicitly in double  quotes
       or  angle  brackets  must  be  specified by absolute path.  Also, when specifying angle brackets inside a
       generator expression, be sure to encode the closing <b>&gt;</b> as <u>$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt;</u>.  For example:

          target_precompile_headers(mylib PRIVATE
            "$&lt;$&lt;COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX&gt;:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cxx_only.h&gt;"
            "$&lt;$&lt;COMPILE_LANGUAGE:C&gt;:&lt;stddef.h$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt;&gt;"
            "$&lt;$&lt;COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX&gt;:&lt;cstddef$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt;&gt;"
          )

   <b>Reusing</b> <b>Precompile</b> <b>Headers</b>
       The command also supports a second signature which can be used  to  specify  that  one  target  reuses  a
       precompiled header file artifact from another target instead of generating its own:

          target_precompile_headers(&lt;target&gt; REUSE_FROM &lt;other_target&gt;)

       This  form  sets  the <u>PRECOMPILE_HEADERS_REUSE_FROM</u> property to <b>&lt;other_target&gt;</b> and adds a dependency such
       that <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> will depend on <b>&lt;other_target&gt;</b>.  CMake will halt with an  error  if  the  <u>PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</u>
       property of <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> is already set when the <b>REUSE_FROM</b> form is used.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The <b>REUSE_FROM</b> form requires the same set of compiler options, compiler flags and compiler definitions
          for  both  <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>  and  <b>&lt;other_target&gt;</b>.   Some  compilers  (e.g.  GCC)  may  issue  a warning if the
          precompiled header file cannot be used (<b>-Winvalid-pch</b>).

          target_sources(&lt;target&gt;
            &lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; [items1...]
            [&lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; [items2...] ...])

       Specifies sources to use when building a target and/or its dependents.  The named <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> must have been
       created  by a command such as <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u> or <u>add_custom_target()</u> and must not be an
       <u>ALIAS</u> <u>target</u>.  The <b>&lt;items&gt;</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       Added in version 3.20: <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> can be a custom target.

       The <b>INTERFACE</b>, <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>PRIVATE</b> keywords are required to specify the <u>scope</u> of  the  source  file  paths
       (<b>&lt;items&gt;</b>)  that  follow  them.   <b>PRIVATE</b> and <b>PUBLIC</b> items will populate the <u>SOURCES</u> property of <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>,
       which are  used  when  building  the  target  itself.  <b>PUBLIC</b>  and  <b>INTERFACE</b>  items  will  populate  the

       <u>add_custom_target()</u> can only have <b>PRIVATE</b> scope.

       Repeated calls for the same <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> append items in the order called.

       Added in version 3.3: Allow exporting targets with <u>INTERFACE_SOURCES</u>.

       Added in version 3.11: Allow setting <b>INTERFACE</b> items on <u>IMPORTED</u> <u>targets</u>.

       Changed in version 3.13: Relative source file paths are interpreted as  being  relative  to  the  current
       source directory (i.e. <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>).  See policy <u>CMP0076</u>.

       A  path  that begins with a generator expression is left unmodified.  When a target's <u>SOURCE_DIR</u> property
       differs from <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>, use absolute paths in generator expressions to ensure the  sources
       are correctly assigned to the target.

          # WRONG: starts with generator expression, but relative path used
          target_sources(MyTarget PRIVATE "$&lt;$&lt;CONFIG:Debug&gt;:dbgsrc.cpp&gt;")

          # CORRECT: absolute path used inside the generator expression
          target_sources(MyTarget PRIVATE "$&lt;$&lt;CONFIG:Debug&gt;:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/dbgsrc.cpp&gt;")

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>File</b> <b>Sets</b>
       Added in version 3.23.

          target_sources(&lt;target&gt;
            [&lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt;
             [FILE_SET &lt;set&gt; [TYPE &lt;type&gt;] [BASE_DIRS &lt;dirs&gt;...] [FILES &lt;files&gt;...]]...
            ]...)

       Adds  a file set to a target, or adds files to an existing file set. Targets have zero or more named file
       sets. Each file set has a name, a type, a scope of <b>INTERFACE</b>,  <b>PUBLIC</b>,  or  <b>PRIVATE</b>,  one  or  more  base
       directories, and files within those directories. The acceptable types include:

       <b>HEADERS</b>
          Sources intended to be used via a language's <b>#include</b> mechanism.

       <b>CXX_MODULES</b>
              Added in version 3.28.

              Sources  which  contain  C++  interface  module  or  partition units (i.e., those using the <b>export</b>
              keyword). This file set type may not have an <b>INTERFACE</b> scope except on <b>IMPORTED</b> targets.

       The optional default file sets are named after their type. The target may  not  be  a  custom  target  or
       <u>FRAMEWORK</u> target.

       Files  in  a  <b>PRIVATE</b>  or <b>PUBLIC</b> file set are marked as source files for the purposes of IDE integration.
       Additionally, files in <b>HEADERS</b> file sets have their <u>HEADER_FILE_ONLY</u> property set to <b>TRUE</b>.  Files  in  an
       <b>INTERFACE</b>  or  <b>PUBLIC</b>  file set can be installed with the <u>install(TARGETS)</u> command, and exported with the
       <u>install(EXPORT)</u> and <u>export()</u> commands.

       Each <b>target_sources(FILE_SET)</b> entry starts with <b>INTERFACE</b>, <b>PUBLIC</b>, or <b>PRIVATE</b> and accepts  the  following
       arguments:

       <b>FILE_SET</b> <b>&lt;set&gt;</b>
          The  name  of the file set to create or add to. It must contain only letters, numbers and underscores.
          Names starting with a capital letter are reserved for built-in file sets predefined by CMake. The only
          predefined set names are those matching the acceptable types. All other set names must not start  with
          a capital letter or underscore.

       <b>TYPE</b> <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>
          Every  file  set  is associated with a particular type of file. Only types specified above may be used
          and it is an error to specify anything else. As a special case, if the name of the file set is one  of
          the  types,  the  type does not need to be specified and the <b>TYPE</b> <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> arguments can be omitted. For
          all other file set names, <b>TYPE</b> is required.

       <b>BASE_DIRS</b> <b>&lt;dirs&gt;...</b>
          An optional list of base directories of the file set. Any relative path is treated as relative to  the
          current  source directory (i.e. <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>). If no <b>BASE_DIRS</b> are specified when the file
          set is first created, the value of <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u> is added. This argument supports <u>generator</u>
          <u>expressions</u>.

          No two base directories for a file set may be sub-directories of each other.  This requirement must be
          met across all base directories added to  a  file  set,  not  just  those  within  a  single  call  to
          <b>target_sources()</b>.

       <b>FILES</b> <b>&lt;files&gt;...</b>
          An optional list of files to add to the file set. Each file must be in one of the base directories, or
          a subdirectory of one of the base directories. This argument supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

          If  relative paths are specified, they are considered relative to <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u> at the time
          <b>target_sources()</b> is called. An exception to this is a path starting with <b>$&lt;</b>. Such paths are treated as
          relative to the target's source directory after evaluation of generator expressions.

       The following target properties are set by <b>target_sources(FILE_SET)</b>, but they  should  not  generally  be
       manipulated directly:

       For file sets of type <b>HEADERS</b>:

       • <u>HEADER_SETS</u>

       • <u>INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS</u>

       • <u>HEADER_SET</u>

       • <u>HEADER_SET_&lt;NAME&gt;</u>

       • <u>HEADER_DIRS</u>

       • <u>HEADER_DIRS_&lt;NAME&gt;</u>

       For file sets of type <b>CXX_MODULES</b>:

       • <u>CXX_MODULE_SETS</u>

       • <u>INTERFACE_CXX_MODULE_SETS</u>

       • <u>CXX_MODULE_SET</u>

       • <u>CXX_MODULE_SET_&lt;NAME&gt;</u>

       • <u>CXX_MODULE_DIRS</u>

       • <u>CXX_MODULE_DIRS_&lt;NAME&gt;</u>

       Target  properties  related  to  include  directories  are  also  modified by <b>target_sources(FILE_SET)</b> as
       follows:

       <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>
          If the <b>TYPE</b> is <b>HEADERS</b>, and the scope of the file set is <b>PRIVATE</b> or <b>PUBLIC</b>, all of  the  <b>BASE_DIRS</b>  of
          the file set are wrapped in <u>$&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE&gt;</u> and appended to this property.

       <u>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>
          If  the <b>TYPE</b> is <b>HEADERS</b>, and the scope of the file set is <b>INTERFACE</b> or <b>PUBLIC</b>, all of the <b>BASE_DIRS</b> of
          the file set are wrapped in <u>$&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE&gt;</u> and appended to this property.

   <b>See</b> <b>Also</b>
       • <u>add_executable()</u>

       • <u>add_library()</u>

       • <u>target_compile_definitions()</u>

       • <u>target_compile_features()</u>

       • <u>target_compile_options()</u>

                      [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;var&gt;])

       Added in version 3.25.

       Try  building  a  project.   Build  success  returns  <b>TRUE</b>   and   build   failure   returns   <b>FALSE</b>   in
       <b>&lt;compileResultVar&gt;</b>.

       In  this  form,  <b>&lt;srcdir&gt;</b>  should  contain  a  complete  CMake project with a <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file and all
       sources.  The <b>&lt;bindir&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;srcdir&gt;</b> will not be deleted after this command is run.  Specify  <b>&lt;targetName&gt;</b>
       to  build  a  specific target instead of the <b>all</b> or <b>ALL_BUILD</b> target.  See below for the meaning of other
       options.

       Changed in version  3.24:  CMake  variables  describing  platform  settings,  and  those  listed  by  the
       <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES</u>  variable,  are  propagated  into the project's build configuration.
       See policy <u>CMP0137</u>.  Previously this was only done by the <u>source</u> <u>file</u> signature.

       Added in version 3.26: This command records a <u>configure-log</u> <u>try_compile</u> <u>event</u> if the <b>NO_LOG</b> option is not
       specified.

       Added in version 3.30: If the <u>PROPAGATE_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES_TO_TRY_COMPILE</u> global property is set to true,
       <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES</u> is propagated into the project's build configuration.

       This command supports an alternate  signature  for  CMake  older  than  3.25.   The  signature  above  is
       recommended for clarity.

                      [&lt;LANG&gt;_EXTENSIONS &lt;bool&gt;]
                      )

       Added in version 3.25.

       Try  building  an  executable or static library from one or more source files (which one is determined by
       the <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u> variable). Build success returns <b>TRUE</b> and build failure  returns  <b>FALSE</b>
       in <b>&lt;compileResultVar&gt;</b>.

       In  this  form,  one  or  more  source  files  must  be  provided.  Additionally,  one  of <b>SOURCES</b> and/or
       <b>SOURCE_FROM_*</b> must precede other keywords.

       If <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u> is unset or is set to <b>EXECUTABLE</b>, the sources must include a  definition
       for  <b>main</b>  and  CMake  will  create  a  <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>  file to build the source(s) as an executable.  If
       <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u> is set to <b>STATIC_LIBRARY</b>, a static library will be  built  instead  and  no
       definition  for  <b>main</b>  is  required.   For an executable, the generated <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file would contain
       something like the following:

          add_definitions(&lt;expanded COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from caller&gt;)
          include_directories(${INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES})
          link_directories(${LINK_DIRECTORIES})
          add_executable(cmTryCompileExec &lt;srcfile&gt;...)
          target_link_options(cmTryCompileExec PRIVATE &lt;LINK_OPTIONS from caller&gt;)
          target_link_libraries(cmTryCompileExec ${LINK_LIBRARIES})

       CMake  automatically  generates,   for   each   <b>try_compile</b>   operation,   a   unique   directory   under
       <b>${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/CMakeFiles/CMakeScratch</b>  with  an  unspecified  name.   These directories are cleaned
       automatically unless <u>--debug-trycompile</u> is passed to <b>cmake</b>.  Such directories from previous runs are also
       unconditionally cleaned at the beginning of any <b>cmake</b> execution.

       This command supports an alternate  signature  for  CMake  older  than  3.25.   The  signature  above  is
       recommended for clarity.

          try_compile(&lt;compileResultVar&gt; &lt;bindir&gt; &lt;srcfile|SOURCES srcfile...&gt;
                      [CMAKE_FLAGS &lt;flags&gt;...]
                      [COMPILE_DEFINITIONS &lt;defs&gt;...]
                      [LINK_OPTIONS &lt;options&gt;...]
                      [LINK_LIBRARIES &lt;libs&gt;...]
                      [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;var&gt;]
                      [COPY_FILE &lt;fileName&gt; [COPY_FILE_ERROR &lt;var&gt;]]
                      [&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD &lt;std&gt;]
                      [&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_REQUIRED &lt;bool&gt;]
                      [&lt;LANG&gt;_EXTENSIONS &lt;bool&gt;]
                      )

       In  this version, <b>try_compile</b> will use <b>&lt;bindir&gt;/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp</b> for its operation, and all such files
       will be cleaned automatically.  For debugging, <u>--debug-trycompile</u> can be passed to <b>cmake</b>  to  avoid  this
       clean.   However, multiple sequential <b>try_compile</b> operations, if given the same <b>&lt;bindir&gt;</b>, will reuse this
       single output directory, such that you can only debug one such <b>try_compile</b> call at a time.   Use  of  the
       newer signature is recommended to simplify debugging of multiple <b>try_compile</b> operations.

   <b>Options</b>
       The options for the above signatures are:

       <b>CMAKE_FLAGS</b> <b>&lt;flags&gt;...</b>
              Specify flags of the form <u>-DVAR:TYPE=VALUE</u> to be passed to the <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u> command-line used to drive
              the   test  build.   The  above  example  shows  how  values  for  variables  <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b>,
              <b>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b>, <b>LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>, <b>LINK_LIBRARIES</b>, and <b>LINK_OPTIONS</b> are used. Compiler options
              can be passed in like <u>CMAKE_FLAGS</u> <u>-DCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS=-Werror</u>.

       <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b> <b>&lt;defs&gt;...</b>
              Specify <b>-Ddefinition</b> arguments to pass to <u>add_definitions()</u> in the generated test project.

       <b>COPY_FILE</b> <b>&lt;fileName&gt;</b>
              Copy the built executable or static library to the given <b>&lt;fileName&gt;</b>.

       <b>COPY_FILE_ERROR</b> <b>&lt;var&gt;</b>
              Use after <b>COPY_FILE</b> to capture into variable <b>&lt;var&gt;</b> any error message encountered while  trying  to
              copy the file.

       <b>LINK_LIBRARIES</b> <b>&lt;libs&gt;...</b>
              Specify  libraries  to  be  linked  in  the generated project.  The list of libraries may refer to
              system libraries and to <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> from the calling project.

              If this option is specified, any <b>-DLINK_LIBRARIES=...</b> value given to the <b>CMAKE_FLAGS</b>  option  will
              be ignored.

              Added in version 3.29: Alias targets to imported libraries are also supported.

       <b>LINK_OPTIONS</b> <b>&lt;options&gt;...</b>
              Added in version 3.14.

              Specify  link  step  options to pass to <u>target_link_options()</u> or to set the <u>STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS</u>
              target property in the generated project, depending on the <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u> variable.

       <b>LINKER_LANGUAGE</b> <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.29.

              Specify the <u>LINKER_LANGUAGE</u> target property of the generated project.  When using multiple  source
              files with different languages, set this to the language of the source file containing the program
              entry point, e.g., <b>main</b>.

       <b>LOG_DESCRIPTION</b> <b>&lt;text&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.26.

              Specify  a  non-empty  text  description  of  the  purpose  of the check.  This is recorded in the
              <u><a href="../man7/cmake-configure-log.7.html">cmake-configure-log</a>(7)</u> entry.

       <b>NO_CACHE</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              The result will be stored in a normal variable rather than a cache entry.

              The result variable is normally cached so that a simple pattern can be used to avoid repeating the
              test on subsequent executions of CMake:

                 if(NOT DEFINED RESULTVAR)
                   # ...(check-specific setup code)...
                   try_compile(RESULTVAR ...)
                   # ...(check-specific logging and cleanup code)...
                 endif()

              If the guard variable and result variable are not the same (for example, if the test is part of  a
              larger  inspection), <b>NO_CACHE</b> may be useful to avoid leaking the intermediate result variable into
              the cache.

       <b>NO_LOG</b> Added in version 3.26.

              Do not record a <u><a href="../man7/cmake-configure-log.7.html">cmake-configure-log</a>(7)</u> entry for this call.

       <b>OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> <b>&lt;var&gt;</b>
              Store the output from the build process in the given variable.

       <b>SOURCE_FROM_CONTENT</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>&lt;content&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              Write <b>&lt;content&gt;</b> to a file named <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> in the operation directory.  This can be used to bypass the
              need to separately write a source file when the contents of the file  are  dynamically  specified.
              The specified <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> is not allowed to contain path components.

              <b>SOURCE_FROM_CONTENT</b> may be specified multiple times.

       <b>SOURCE_FROM_FILE</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              Copy  <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>  to  a  file named <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> in the operation directory. This can be used to consolidate
              files into the operation directory, which may be useful if a source which already exists (i.e.  as
              a  stand-alone  file  in a project's source repository) needs to refer to other file(s) created by
              <b>SOURCE_FROM_*</b>. (Otherwise, <b>SOURCES</b> is usually  more  convenient.)  The  specified  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>  is  not
              allowed to contain path components.

       <b>SOURCE_FROM_VAR</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>&lt;var&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              Write the contents of <b>&lt;var&gt;</b> to a file named <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> in the operation directory. This is the same as
              <b>SOURCE_FROM_CONTENT</b>,  but  takes  the  contents  from  the  specified  CMake variable, rather than
              directly, which may be useful when passing arguments through a function which  wraps  <b>try_compile</b>.
              The specified <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> is not allowed to contain path components.

              <b>SOURCE_FROM_VAR</b> may be specified multiple times.

       <b>SOURCES_TYPE</b> <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.28.

              Sources  may be classified using the <b>SOURCES_TYPE</b> argument. Once specified, all subsequent sources
              specified will be treated as that type until another <b>SOURCES_TYPE</b> is given. Available types are:

              <b>NORMAL</b> Sources are not added to any <b>FILE_SET</b> in the generated project.

              <b>CXX_MODULE</b>
                     Added in version 3.28.

                     Sources are added to a <b>FILE_SET</b> of type <b>CXX_MODULES</b> in the generated project.

              The default type of sources is <b>NORMAL</b>.

       <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</b> <b>&lt;std&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.8.

              Specify the <u>C_STANDARD</u>, <u>CXX_STANDARD</u>,  <u>OBJC_STANDARD</u>,  <u>OBJCXX_STANDARD</u>,  or  <u>CUDA_STANDARD</u>  target
              property of the generated project.

       <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_REQUIRED</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.8.

              Specify      the      <u>C_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>,      <u>CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>,     <u>OBJC_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>,
              <u>OBJCXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>,or <u>CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u> target property of the generated project.

       <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_EXTENSIONS</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.8.

              Specify the <u>C_EXTENSIONS</u>, <u>CXX_EXTENSIONS</u>, <u>OBJC_EXTENSIONS</u>, <u>OBJCXX_EXTENSIONS</u>,  or  <u>CUDA_EXTENSIONS</u>
              target property of the generated project.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Behavior</b> <b>Settings</b>
       Added  in  version  3.4:  If  set,  the  following  variables  are passed in to the generated try_compile
       CMakeLists.txt to initialize compile target properties with default values:

       • <u>CMAKE_CUDA_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_ENABLE_EXPORTS</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_WATCOM_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</u>

       If <u>CMP0056</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>, then <u>CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS</u> is passed in as well.

       Changed in version 3.14: If <u>CMP0083</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>, then in order to obtain correct behavior at link time,
       the <b>check_pie_supported()</b> command from the <u>CheckPIESupported</u> module  must  be  called  before  using  the
       <b>try_compile</b> command.

       The current settings of <u>CMP0065</u> and <u>CMP0083</u> are propagated through to the generated test project.

       Set variable <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION</u> to choose a build configuration:

       • For multi-config generators, this selects which configuration to build.

       • For single-config generators, this sets <u>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</u> in the test project.

       Added  in  version 3.6: Set the <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u> variable to specify the type of target used
       for the source file signature.

       Added in version 3.6: Set the <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES</u> variable  to  specify  variables  that
       must  be propagated into the test project.  This variable is meant for use only in toolchain files and is
       only honored by the <b>try_compile()</b> command for the source files form, not when given a whole project.

       Changed  in  version  3.8:   If   <u>CMP0067</u>   is   set   to   <b>NEW</b>,   or   any   of   the   <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</b>,
       <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_REQUIRED</b>, or <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_EXTENSIONS</b> options are used, then the language standard variables are
       honored:

       • <u>CMAKE_C_STANDARD</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_OBJC_STANDARD</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_OBJC_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_OBJC_EXTENSIONS</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_OBJCXX_STANDARD</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_OBJCXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_OBJCXX_EXTENSIONS</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_CUDA_EXTENSIONS</u>

       Their  values  are  used  to  set  the  corresponding  target properties in the generated project (unless
       overridden by an explicit option).

       Changed in version 3.14: For the  <u>Green</u>  <u>Hills</u>  <u>MULTI</u>  generator,  the  GHS  toolset  and  target  system
       customization cache variables are also propagated into the test project.

       Added in version 3.24: The <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_NO_PLATFORM_VARIABLES</u> variable may be set to disable passing
       platform variables into the test project.

       Added  in  version  3.25:  If  <u>CMP0141</u>  is set to <b>NEW</b>, one can use <u>CMAKE_MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT</u> to
       specify the MSVC debug information format.

       Added in version 3.30: If the <u>PROPAGATE_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES_TO_TRY_COMPILE</u> global property is set to true,
       <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES</u> is propagated into the test project's build configuration when using the
       <u>whole-project</u> <u>signature</u>.

       Try building an executable from one or more source files.  Build success returns <b>TRUE</b> and  build  failure
       returns <b>FALSE</b> in <b>&lt;compileResultVar&gt;</b>.  If the build succeeds, this runs the executable and stores the exit
       code  in <b>&lt;runResultVar&gt;</b>.  If the executable was built, but failed to run, then <b>&lt;runResultVar&gt;</b> will be set
       to <b>FAILED_TO_RUN</b>.  See command <u>try_compile()</u> for documentation of options common to  both  commands,  and
       for information on how the test project is constructed to build the source file.

       One or more source files must be provided. Additionally, one of <b>SOURCES</b> and/or <b>SOURCE_FROM_*</b> must precede
       other keywords.

       Added  in  version  3.26:  This command records a <u>configure-log</u> <u>try_run</u> <u>event</u> if the <b>NO_LOG</b> option is not

   <b>Options</b>
       The options specific to <b>try_run</b> are:

       <b>COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> <b>&lt;var&gt;</b>
              Report the compile step build output in a given variable.

       <b>OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> <b>&lt;var&gt;</b>
              Report  the compile build output and the output from running the executable in the given variable.
              This option exists for legacy reasons and is only supported by the old <b>try_run</b> signature.   Prefer
              <b>COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> and <b>RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> instead.

       <b>RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> <b>&lt;var&gt;</b>
              Report the output from running the executable in a given variable.

       <b>RUN_OUTPUT_STDOUT_VARIABLE</b> <b>&lt;var&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              Report the output of stdout from running the executable in a given variable.

       <b>RUN_OUTPUT_STDERR_VARIABLE</b> <b>&lt;var&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              Report the output of stderr from running the executable in a given variable.

       <b>WORKING_DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;var&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.20.

              Run  the  executable  in the given directory. If no <b>WORKING_DIRECTORY</b> is specified, the executable
              will run in <b>&lt;bindir&gt;</b> or the current build directory.

       <b>ARGS</b> <b>&lt;args&gt;...</b>
              Additional arguments to pass to the executable when running it.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Behavior</b> <b>Settings</b>
       Set variable <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION</u> to choose a build configuration:

       • For multi-config generators, this selects which configuration to build.

       • For single-config generators, this sets <u>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</u> in the test project.

   <b>Behavior</b> <b>when</b> <b>Cross</b> <b>Compiling</b>
       Added in version 3.3: Use <b>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</b> when running cross-compiled binaries.

       When cross compiling, the executable compiled in the first step usually cannot be run on the build  host.
       The   <b>try_run</b>   command   checks  the  <u>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING</u>  variable  to  detect  whether  CMake  is  in
       cross-compiling mode.  If that is the case, it will still try to compile the executable, but it will  not
       try  to  run  the  executable  unless the <u>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u> variable is set.  Instead it will
       create cache variables which must be filled by the user or by presetting them in some CMake  script  file
       to the values the executable would have produced if it had been run on its actual target platform.  These
       cache entries are:

       <b>&lt;runResultVar&gt;</b>
              Exit code if the executable were to be run on the target platform.

       <b>&lt;runResultVar&gt;__TRYRUN_OUTPUT</b>
              Output  from  stdout  and stderr if the executable were to be run on the target platform.  This is
              created only if the <b>RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> or <b>OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> option was used.

       In order to make cross compiling your project easier, use <b>try_run</b> only if really required.   If  you  use
       <b>try_run</b>,   use   the   <b>RUN_OUTPUT_STDOUT_VARIABLE</b>,   <b>RUN_OUTPUT_STDERR_VARIABLE</b>,  <b>RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b>  or
       <b>OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> options only if really required.  Using them will require that when cross-compiling,  the
       cache  variables  will have to be set manually to the output of the executable.  You can also "guard" the
       calls to  <b>try_run</b>  with  an  <u>if()</u>  block  checking  the  <u>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING</u>  variable  and  provide  an
       easy-to-preset alternative for this case.

</pre><h4><b>CTEST</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       These commands are available only in CTest scripts.

   <b>ctest_build</b>
       Perform the <u>CTest</u> <u>Build</u> <u>Step</u> as a <u>Dashboard</u> <u>Client</u>.

                      [CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR &lt;result-var&gt;]
                      )

       Build the project and store results in <b>Build.xml</b> for submission with the <u>ctest_submit()</u> command.

       The  <u>CTEST_BUILD_COMMAND</u> variable may be set to explicitly specify the build command line.  Otherwise the
       build command line is computed automatically based on the options given.

       The options are:

       <b>BUILD</b> <b>&lt;build-dir&gt;</b>
              Specify the top-level build directory.  If not given, the <u>CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY</u> variable is used.

       <b>APPEND</b> Mark <b>Build.xml</b> for append to results previously submitted to a dashboard  server  since  the  last
              <u>ctest_start()</u>  call.   Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.  This does <u>not</u>
              cause results to be appended to a <b>.xml</b> file produced by a previous call to this command.

       <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>&lt;config&gt;</b>
              Specify the build configuration (e.g. <b>Debug</b>).   If  not  specified  the  <b>CTEST_BUILD_CONFIGURATION</b>
              variable  will  be  checked.   Otherwise the <u>-C</u> <u>&lt;cfg&gt;</u> option given to the <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> command will be
              used, if any.

       <b>PARALLEL_LEVEL</b> <b>&lt;parallel&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              Specify  the  parallel  level  of  the  underlying  build   system.    If   not   specified,   the
              <u>CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL</u> environment variable will be checked.

       <b>FLAGS</b> <b>&lt;flags&gt;</b>
              Pass additional arguments to the underlying build command.  If not specified the <b>CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS</b>
              variable will be checked.  This can, e.g., be used to trigger a parallel build using the <b>-j</b> option
              of <b>make</b>. See the <u>ProcessorCount</u> module for an example.

       <b>PROJECT_NAME</b> <b>&lt;project-name&gt;</b>
              Ignored since CMake 3.0.

              Changed in version 3.14: This value is no longer required.

       <b>TARGET</b> <b>&lt;target-name&gt;</b>
              Specify  the  name of a target to build.  If not specified the <b>CTEST_BUILD_TARGET</b> variable will be
              checked.  Otherwise the default target will be built.  This is the "all" target (called  <b>ALL_BUILD</b>
              in <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>).

       <b>NUMBER_ERRORS</b> <b>&lt;num-err-var&gt;</b>
              Store the number of build errors detected in the given variable.

       <b>NUMBER_WARNINGS</b> <b>&lt;num-warn-var&gt;</b>
              Store the number of build warnings detected in the given variable.

       <b>RETURN_VALUE</b> <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>
              Store the return value of the native build tool in the given variable.

       <b>CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR</b> <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Store  in  the  <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>  variable  -1 if there are any errors running the command and prevent
              ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

       <b>QUIET</b>  Added in version 3.3.

              Suppress any CTest-specific  non-error  output  that  would  have  been  printed  to  the  console
              otherwise.   The summary of warnings / errors, as well as the output from the native build tool is
              unaffected by this option.

   <b>ctest_configure</b>
       Perform the <u>CTest</u> <u>Configure</u> <u>Step</u> as a <u>Dashboard</u> <u>Client</u>.

          ctest_configure([BUILD &lt;build-dir&gt;] [SOURCE &lt;source-dir&gt;] [APPEND]

                          [CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR &lt;result-var&gt;])

       Configure  the  project  build  tree  and  record  results  in  <b>Configure.xml</b>  for  submission  with  the
       <u>ctest_submit()</u> command.

       The options are:

       <b>BUILD</b> <b>&lt;build-dir&gt;</b>
              Specify the top-level build directory.  If not given, the <u>CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY</u> variable is used.

       <b>SOURCE</b> <b>&lt;source-dir&gt;</b>
              Specify the source directory.  If not given, the <u>CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY</u> variable is used.

       <b>APPEND</b> Mark <b>Configure.xml</b> for append to results previously submitted to a dashboard server since the last
              <u>ctest_start()</u>  call.   Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.  This does <u>not</u>
              cause results to be appended to a <b>.xml</b> file produced by a previous call to this command.

       <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>&lt;options&gt;</b>
              Specify command-line arguments to pass to the configuration tool.

       <b>RETURN_VALUE</b> <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>
              Store in the <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b> variable the return value of the native configuration tool.

       <b>CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR</b> <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Store in the <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b> variable -1 if there are any errors  running  the  command  and  prevent
              ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

       <b>QUIET</b>  Added in version 3.3.

              Suppress  any  CTest-specific  non-error  messages  that  would have otherwise been printed to the
              console.  Output from the underlying configure command is not affected.

   <b>ctest_coverage</b>
       Perform the <u>CTest</u> <u>Coverage</u> <u>Step</u> as a <u>Dashboard</u> <u>Client</u>.

          ctest_coverage([BUILD &lt;build-dir&gt;] [APPEND]

                         )

       Collect coverage tool results and stores them in <b>Coverage.xml</b>  for  submission  with  the  <u>ctest_submit()</u>
       command.

       The options are:

       <b>BUILD</b> <b>&lt;build-dir&gt;</b>
              Specify the top-level build directory.  If not given, the <u>CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY</u> variable is used.

       <b>APPEND</b> Mark  <b>Coverage.xml</b> for append to results previously submitted to a dashboard server since the last
              <u>ctest_start()</u> call.  Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.  This  does  <u>not</u>
              cause results to be appended to a <b>.xml</b> file produced by a previous call to this command.

       <b>LABELS</b> Filter  the  coverage  report to include only source files labeled with at least one of the labels
              specified.

       <b>RETURN_VALUE</b> <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>
              Store in the <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b> variable <b>0</b> if coverage tools ran without error and non-zero otherwise.

       <b>CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR</b> <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Store in the <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b> variable -1 if there are any errors  running  the  command  and  prevent
              ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

       <b>QUIET</b>  Added in version 3.3.

              Suppress  any  CTest-specific  non-error  output  that  would  have  been  printed  to the console
              otherwise.  The summary indicating how many lines of code  were  covered  is  unaffected  by  this
              option.

   <b>ctest_empty_binary_directory</b>
       empties the binary directory

          ctest_empty_binary_directory(&lt;directory&gt;)

       Removes  a binary directory.  This command will perform some checks prior to deleting the directory in an
       attempt to avoid malicious or accidental directory deletion.

   <b>ctest_memcheck</b>
       Perform the <u>CTest</u> <u>MemCheck</u> <u>Step</u> as a <u>Dashboard</u> <u>Client</u>.

                         [QUIET]
                         )

       Run tests with a dynamic analysis tool  and  store  results  in  <b>MemCheck.xml</b>  for  submission  with  the
       <u>ctest_submit()</u> command.

       Most options are the same as those for the <u>ctest_test()</u> command.

       The options unique to this command are:

       <b>DEFECT_COUNT</b> <b>&lt;defect-count-var&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.8.

              Store in the <b>&lt;defect-count-var&gt;</b> the number of defects found.

   <b>ctest_read_custom_files</b>
       read CTestCustom files.

          ctest_read_custom_files(&lt;directory&gt;...)

       Read all the CTestCustom.ctest or CTestCustom.cmake files from the given directory.

       By default, invoking <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> without a script will read custom files from the binary directory.

   <b>ctest_run_script</b>
       runs a <u>ctest</u> <u>-S</u> script

          ctest_run_script([NEW_PROCESS] script_file_name script_file_name1
                      script_file_name2 ... [RETURN_VALUE var])

       Runs  a  script  or  scripts  much like if it was run from <u>ctest</u> <u>-S</u>.  If no argument is provided then the
       current script is run using the current settings of the variables.  If <b>NEW_PROCESS</b> is specified then each
       script will be run in a separate process.If <b>RETURN_VALUE</b> is specified the return value of the last script
       run will be put into <b>var</b>.

   <b>ctest_sleep</b>
       sleeps for some amount of time

          ctest_sleep(&lt;seconds&gt;)

       Sleep for given number of seconds.

          ctest_sleep(&lt;time1&gt; &lt;duration&gt; &lt;time2&gt;)

       Sleep for t=(time1 + duration - time2) seconds if t &gt; 0.

   <b>ctest_start</b>
       Starts the testing for a given model

          ctest_start(&lt;model&gt; [&lt;source&gt; [&lt;binary&gt;]] [GROUP &lt;group&gt;] [QUIET])

          ctest_start([&lt;model&gt; [&lt;source&gt; [&lt;binary&gt;]]] [GROUP &lt;group&gt;] APPEND [QUIET])

       Starts the testing for a given model.  The command  should  be  called  after  the  binary  directory  is
       initialized.

       The parameters are as follows:

       <b>&lt;model&gt;</b>
              Set  the  dashboard  model. Must be one of <b>Experimental</b>, <b>Continuous</b>, or <b>Nightly</b>. This parameter is
              required unless <b>APPEND</b> is specified.

       <b>&lt;source&gt;</b>
              Set the source directory. If not specified, the value of <u>CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY</u> is used instead.

       <b>&lt;binary&gt;</b>
              Set the binary directory. If not specified, the value of <u>CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY</u> is used instead.

       <b>GROUP</b> <b>&lt;group&gt;</b>
              If <b>GROUP</b> is used, the submissions will go to the specified group on the CDash server. If no  <b>GROUP</b>
              is specified, the name of the model is used by default.

              Changed  in  version  3.16: This replaces the deprecated option <b>TRACK</b>. Despite the name change its
              behavior is unchanged.

       <b>APPEND</b> If <b>APPEND</b> is used, the existing <b>TAG</b> is used rather than creating a new one based  on  the  current
              time stamp. If you use <b>APPEND</b>, you can omit the <b>&lt;model&gt;</b> and <b>GROUP</b> <b>&lt;group&gt;</b> parameters, because they
              will be read from the generated <b>TAG</b> file. For example:

                 ctest_start(Experimental GROUP GroupExperimental)

              Later, in another <u>ctest</u> <u>-S</u> script:

                 ctest_start(APPEND)

              When  the  second  script  runs  <b>ctest_start(APPEND)</b>,  it  will  read  the  <b>Experimental</b> model and
              <b>GroupExperimental</b> group from the <b>TAG</b> file generated by the  first  <b>ctest_start()</b>  command.  Please
              note that if you call <b>ctest_start(APPEND)</b> and specify a different model or group than in the first
              <b>ctest_start()</b> command, a warning will be issued, and the new model and group will be used.

       <b>QUIET</b>  Added in version 3.3.

              If  <b>QUIET</b> is used, CTest will suppress any non-error messages that it otherwise would have printed
              to the console.

       The parameters for <b>ctest_start()</b> can be issued in any order, with the exception that  <b>&lt;model&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;source&gt;</b>,
       and  <b>&lt;binary&gt;</b>  have  to  appear in that order with respect to each other. The following are all valid and
       equivalent:

          ctest_start(Experimental path/to/source path/to/binary GROUP SomeGroup QUIET APPEND)

          ctest_start(GROUP SomeGroup Experimental QUIET path/to/source APPEND path/to/binary)

          ctest_start(APPEND QUIET Experimental path/to/source GROUP SomeGroup path/to/binary)

       However, for the sake of readability, it is recommended that you  order  your  parameters  in  the  order
       listed at the top of this page.

       If  the  <u>CTEST_CHECKOUT_COMMAND</u>  variable  (or  the  <u>CTEST_CVS_CHECKOUT</u>  variable) is set, its content is
       treated as command-line.  The command is invoked with the current working directory set to the parent  of
       the source directory, even if the source directory already exists.  This can be used to create the source
       tree from a version control repository.

   <b>ctest_submit</b>
       Perform the <u>CTest</u> <u>Submit</u> <u>Step</u> as a <u>Dashboard</u> <u>Client</u>.

          ctest_submit([PARTS &lt;part&gt;...] [FILES &lt;file&gt;...]

                       )

       Submit results to a dashboard server.  By default all available parts are submitted.

       The options are:

       <b>PARTS</b> <b>&lt;part&gt;...</b>
              Specify a subset of parts to submit.  Valid part names are:

                 Start      = nothing
                 Update     = ctest_update results, in Update.xml
                 Configure  = ctest_configure results, in Configure.xml

                 Submit     = nothing
                 Done       = Build is complete, in Done.xml

       <b>FILES</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b>
              Specify  an  explicit  list of specific files to be submitted.  Each individual file must exist at
              the time of the call.

       <b>SUBMIT_URL</b> <b>&lt;url&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.14.

              The <b>http</b> or <b>https</b> URL of the dashboard server to send  the  submission  to.   If  not  given,  the
              <u>CTEST_SUBMIT_URL</u> variable is used.

       <b>BUILD_ID</b> <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              Store in the <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b> variable the ID assigned to this build by CDash.

       <b>HTTPHEADER</b> <b>&lt;HTTP-header&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.9.

              Specify  HTTP header to be included in the request to CDash during submission.  For example, CDash
              can be configured to only accept submissions from authenticated clients. In this case, you  should
              provide a bearer token in your header:

                 ctest_submit(HTTPHEADER "Authorization: Bearer &lt;auth-token&gt;")

              This suboption can be repeated several times for multiple headers.

       <b>RETRY_COUNT</b> <b>&lt;count&gt;</b>
              Specify how many times to retry a timed-out submission.

       <b>RETRY_DELAY</b> <b>&lt;delay&gt;</b>
              Specify how long (in seconds) to wait after a timed-out submission before attempting to re-submit.

       <b>RETURN_VALUE</b> <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>
              Store in the <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b> variable <b>0</b> for success and non-zero on failure.

       <b>CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR</b> <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.13.

              Store  in  the  <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>  variable  -1 if there are any errors running the command and prevent
              ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

       <b>QUIET</b>  Added in version 3.3.

              Suppress all non-error messages that would have otherwise been printed to the console.

   <b>Submit</b> <b>to</b> <b>CDash</b> <b>Upload</b> <b>API</b>
       Added in version 3.2.

          ctest_submit(CDASH_UPLOAD &lt;file&gt; [CDASH_UPLOAD_TYPE &lt;type&gt;]

                       [QUIET])

       This second signature is used to upload files to CDash via the CDash file upload API. The API first sends
       a request to upload to CDash along with a content hash of the file. If CDash does not  already  have  the
       file,  then  it  is  uploaded.  Along with the file, a CDash type string is specified to tell CDash which
       handler to use to process the data.

       This signature interprets options in the same way as the first one.

       Added in version 3.8: Added the <b>RETRY_COUNT</b>, <b>RETRY_DELAY</b>, <b>QUIET</b> options.

       Added in version 3.9: Added the <b>HTTPHEADER</b> option.

       Added in version 3.13: Added the <b>RETURN_VALUE</b> option.

       Run tests in the project build tree and store results in <b>Test.xml</b> for submission with the  <u>ctest_submit()</u>
       command.

       The options are:

       <b>BUILD</b> <b>&lt;build-dir&gt;</b>
              Specify the top-level build directory.  If not given, the <u>CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY</u> variable is used.

       <b>APPEND</b> Mark  <b>Test.xml</b>  for  append  to  results previously submitted to a dashboard server since the last
              <u>ctest_start()</u> call.  Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.  This  does  <u>not</u>
              cause results to be appended to a <b>.xml</b> file produced by a previous call to this command.

       <b>START</b> <b>&lt;start-number&gt;</b>

       <b>END</b> <b>&lt;end-number&gt;</b>
              Specify the end of a range of test numbers.

       <b>STRIDE</b> <b>&lt;stride-number&gt;</b>
              Specify the stride by which to step across a range of test numbers.

       <b>EXCLUDE</b> <b>&lt;exclude-regex&gt;</b>
              Specify a regular expression matching test names to exclude.

       <b>INCLUDE</b> <b>&lt;include-regex&gt;</b>
              Specify  a  regular expression matching test names to include.  Tests not matching this expression
              are excluded.

       <b>EXCLUDE_LABEL</b> <b>&lt;label-exclude-regex&gt;</b>
              Specify a regular expression matching test labels to exclude.

       <b>INCLUDE_LABEL</b> <b>&lt;label-include-regex&gt;</b>
              Specify a regular expression matching test labels to include.  Tests not matching this  expression
              are excluded.

       <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_FILE</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.29.

              Do NOT run tests listed with their exact name in the given file.

       <b>INCLUDE_FROM_FILE</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.29.

              and cleanup tests would normally be added to the test  set  automatically.  This  option  prevents
              adding  setup  or  cleanup  tests  for  fixtures matching the <b>&lt;regex&gt;</b>. Note that all other fixture
              behavior is retained, including test dependencies and skipping tests that have fixture setup tests
              that fail.

       <b>EXCLUDE_FIXTURE_SETUP</b> <b>&lt;regex&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Same as <b>EXCLUDE_FIXTURE</b> except only matching setup tests are excluded.

       <b>EXCLUDE_FIXTURE_CLEANUP</b> <b>&lt;regex&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Same as <b>EXCLUDE_FIXTURE</b> except only matching cleanup tests are excluded.

       <b>PARALLEL_LEVEL</b> <b>[&lt;level&gt;]</b>
              Run tests in parallel, limited to a given level of parallelism.

              Added in version 3.29: The <b>&lt;level&gt;</b> may be omitted, or <b>0</b>, to let  ctest  use  a  default  level  of
              parallelism, or unbounded parallelism, respectively, as documented by the <u>ctest</u> <u>--parallel</u> option.

       <b>RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.16.

              Specify a <u>resource</u> <u>specification</u> <u>file</u>. See <u>Resource</u> <u>Allocation</u> for more information.

       <b>TEST_LOAD</b> <b>&lt;threshold&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.4.

              While  running  tests in parallel, try not to start tests when they may cause the CPU load to pass
              above a given threshold.  If not specified the <u>CTEST_TEST_LOAD</u> variable will be checked, and  then
              the <u>--test-load</u> command-line argument to <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u>. See also the <b>TestLoad</b> setting in the <u>CTest</u> <u>Test</u>
              <u>Step</u>.

       <b>REPEAT</b> <b>&lt;mode&gt;:&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.17.

              Run tests repeatedly based on the given <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b> up to <b>&lt;n&gt;</b> times.  The modes are:

              <b>UNTIL_FAIL</b>
                     Require  each  test  to  run <b>&lt;n&gt;</b> times without failing in order to pass.  This is useful in
                     finding sporadic failures in test cases.

              <b>UNTIL_PASS</b>
                     Allow each test to run up to <b>&lt;n&gt;</b> times in order to pass.  Repeats tests if  they  fail  for
                     any reason.  This is useful in tolerating sporadic failures in test cases.

              <b>AFTER_TIMEOUT</b>
                     Allow  each  test  to  run  up  to  <b>&lt;n&gt;</b> times in order to pass.  Repeats tests only if they
                     timeout.  This is useful in tolerating sporadic timeouts in test cases on busy machines.

       <b>SCHEDULE_RANDOM</b> <b>&lt;ON|OFF&gt;</b>
              Launch tests in a random order.  This may be useful for detecting implicit test dependencies.

       <b>STOP_ON_FAILURE</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              Stop the execution of the tests once one has failed.

       <b>STOP_TIME</b> <b>&lt;time-of-day&gt;</b>
              Specify a time of day at which the tests should all stop running.

       <b>RETURN_VALUE</b> <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>
              Store in the <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b> variable <b>0</b> if all tests passed.  Store non-zero if anything went wrong.

       <b>CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR</b> <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Store in the <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b> variable -1 if there are any errors  running  the  command  and  prevent
              ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

       <b>OUTPUT_JUNIT</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              Write  test results to <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> in JUnit XML format. If <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> is a relative path, it will be placed
              in the build directory. If <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> already exists, it will be overwritten. Note that the  resulting
              JUnit XML file is <b>not</b> uploaded to CDash because it would be redundant with CTest's <b>Test.xml</b> file.

       <b>QUIET</b>  Added in version 3.3.

              Suppress  any  CTest-specific  non-error  messages  that  would have otherwise been printed to the
              console.  Output from the underlying test command is not affected.   Summary  info  detailing  the
              percentage of passing tests is also unaffected by the <b>QUIET</b> option.

       See  also  the <u>CTEST_CUSTOM_MAXIMUM_PASSED_TEST_OUTPUT_SIZE</u>, <u>CTEST_CUSTOM_MAXIMUM_FAILED_TEST_OUTPUT_SIZE</u>
       and <u>CTEST_CUSTOM_TEST_OUTPUT_TRUNCATION</u> variables, along with their corresponding <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u>  command  line
       options <u>--test-output-size-passed</u>, <u>--test-output-size-failed</u>, and <u>--test-output-truncation</u>.

   <b>Additional</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Measurements</b>
       CTest can parse the output of your tests for extra measurements to report to CDash.

       When  run  as  a <u>Dashboard</u> <u>Client</u>, CTest will include these custom measurements in the <b>Test.xml</b> file that
       gets uploaded to CDash.

       Check the <u>CDash</u> <u>test</u> <u>measurement</u> <u>documentation</u> for more information on the  types  of  test  measurements
       that CDash recognizes.

       The following example demonstrates how to output a variety of custom test measurements.

          std::cout &lt;&lt;
            "&lt;CTestMeasurement type=\"numeric/double\" name=\"score\"&gt;28.3&lt;/CTestMeasurement&gt;"
            &lt;&lt; std::endl;

          std::cout &lt;&lt;
            "&lt;CTestMeasurement type=\"text/string\" name=\"color\"&gt;red&lt;/CTestMeasurement&gt;"
            &lt;&lt; std::endl;

          std::cout &lt;&lt;
            "&lt;CTestMeasurement type=\"text/link\" name=\"CMake URL\"&gt;https://cmake.org&lt;/CTestMeasurement&gt;"
            &lt;&lt; std::endl;

          std::cout &lt;&lt;
            "&lt;CTestMeasurement type=\"text/preformatted\" name=\"Console Output\"&gt;" &lt;&lt;
            "line 1.\n" &lt;&lt;
            "  \033[31;1m line 2. Bold red, and indented!\033[0;0ml\n" &lt;&lt;
            "line 3. Not bold or indented...\n" &lt;&lt;
            "&lt;/CTestMeasurement&gt;" &lt;&lt; std::endl;

   <b>Image</b> <b>Measurements</b>
       The following example demonstrates how to upload test images to CDash.

          std::cout &lt;&lt;
            "&lt;CTestMeasurementFile type=\"image/jpg\" name=\"TestImage\"&gt;" &lt;&lt;
            "/dir/to/test_img.jpg&lt;/CTestMeasurementFile&gt;" &lt;&lt; std::endl;

          std::cout &lt;&lt;
            "&lt;CTestMeasurementFile type=\"image/gif\" name=\"ValidImage\"&gt;" &lt;&lt;
            "/dir/to/valid_img.gif&lt;/CTestMeasurementFile&gt;" &lt;&lt; std::endl;

          std::cout &lt;&lt;
            "&lt;CTestMeasurementFile type=\"image/png\" name=\"AlgoResult\"&gt;" &lt;&lt;
            "/dir/to/img.png&lt;/CTestMeasurementFile&gt;"
            &lt;&lt; std::endl;

       Images  will  be  displayed together in an interactive comparison mode on CDash if they are provided with
       two or more of the following names.

       • <b>TestImage</b>

       • <b>ValidImage</b>

       • <b>BaselineImage</b>

       • <b>DifferenceImage2</b>

       By convention, <b>TestImage</b> is the image generated by your test, and <b>ValidImage</b> (or <b>BaselineImage</b>) is  basis
       of comparison used to determine if the test passed or failed.

       If  another  image  name  is  used  it  will  be  displayed  by CDash as a static image separate from the
       interactive comparison UI.

   <b>Attached</b> <b>Files</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       The following example demonstrates how to upload non-image files to CDash.

          std::cout &lt;&lt;
            "&lt;CTestMeasurementFile type=\"file\" name=\"TestInputData1\"&gt;" &lt;&lt;
            "/dir/to/data1.csv&lt;/CTestMeasurementFile&gt;\n"                   &lt;&lt;
            "&lt;CTestMeasurementFile type=\"file\" name=\"TestInputData2\"&gt;" &lt;&lt;
            "/dir/to/data2.csv&lt;/CTestMeasurementFile&gt;"                     &lt;&lt; std::endl;

       If the name of the file to upload is  known  at  configure  time,  you  can  use  the  <u>ATTACHED_FILES</u>  or
       <u>ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL</u> test properties instead.

   <b>Custom</b> <b>Details</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       The  following example demonstrates how to specify a custom value for the <b>Test</b> <b>Details</b> field displayed on
       CDash.

          std::cout &lt;&lt;
            "&lt;CTestDetails&gt;My Custom Details Value&lt;/CTestDetails&gt;" &lt;&lt; std::endl;

   <b>Additional</b> <b>Labels</b>
       Added in version 3.22.

       The following example demonstrates how to add additional labels to a test at runtime.

          std::cout &lt;&lt;
            "&lt;CTestLabel&gt;Custom Label 1&lt;/CTestLabel&gt;\n" &lt;&lt;
            "&lt;CTestLabel&gt;Custom Label 2&lt;/CTestLabel&gt;"   &lt;&lt; std::endl;

       Use the <u>LABELS</u> test property instead for labels that can be determined at configure time.

   <b>ctest_update</b>
       Perform the <u>CTest</u> <u>Update</u> <u>Step</u> as a <u>Dashboard</u> <u>Client</u>.

          ctest_update([SOURCE &lt;source-dir&gt;]
                       [RETURN_VALUE &lt;result-var&gt;]
                       [CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR &lt;result-var&gt;]
                       [QUIET])

       Update the source tree from version control and record results in  <b>Update.xml</b>  for  submission  with  the
       <u>ctest_submit()</u> command.

       The options are:

       <b>SOURCE</b> <b>&lt;source-dir&gt;</b>
              Specify the source directory.  If not given, the <u>CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY</u> variable is used.

       <b>RETURN_VALUE</b> <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>
              Store in the <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b> variable the number of files updated or <b>-1</b> on error.

       <b>CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR</b> <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.13.

              Store  in  the  <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>  variable  -1 if there are any errors running the command and prevent
              ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

       <b>QUIET</b>  Added in version 3.3.

              Tell CTest to suppress most non-error messages  that  it  would  have  otherwise  printed  to  the
              console.   CTest  will  still  report the new revision of the repository and any conflicting files
              that were found.

       The update always follows the version control branch currently checked out in the source directory.   See
       the  <u>CTest</u>  <u>Update</u>  <u>Step</u>  documentation  for  information  about  variables  that  change the behavior of
       <b>ctest_update()</b>.

   <b>ctest_upload</b>
       Upload files to a dashboard server as a <u>Dashboard</u> <u>Client</u>.

          ctest_upload(FILES &lt;file&gt;... [QUIET] [CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR &lt;result-var&gt;])

       The options are:

       <b>FILES</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b>
              Specify a list of files to be sent along with the build results to the dashboard server.

       <b>QUIET</b>  Added in version 3.3.

              Suppress any CTest-specific  non-error  output  that  would  have  been  printed  to  the  console
              otherwise.

       <b>CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR</b> <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Store  in  the  <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>  variable  -1 if there are any errors running the command and prevent
              ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATED</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       These commands are deprecated and are only  made  available  to  maintain  backward  compatibility.   The
       documentation  of  each  command  states  the CMake version in which it was deprecated.  Do not use these
       commands in new code.

   <b>build_name</b>
       Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy <u>CMP0036</u>.

       Use <b>${CMAKE_SYSTEM}</b> and <b>${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER}</b> instead.

          build_name(variable)

       Sets the specified variable to a string representing the platform and compiler  settings.   These  values
       are now available through the <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM</u> and <u>CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER</u> variables.

   <b>exec_program</b>
       Changed  in  version  3.28:  This  command  is  available only if policy <u>CMP0153</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b>.  Port
       projects to the <u>execute_process()</u> command.

       Deprecated since version 3.0: Use the <u>execute_process()</u> command instead.

       Run an executable program during the processing of the CMakeList.txt file.

          exec_program(Executable [directory in which to run]
                       [ARGS &lt;arguments to executable&gt;]
                       [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;var&gt;]
                       [RETURN_VALUE &lt;var&gt;])

       The executable is run in the optionally specified directory.  The executable can include arguments if  it
       is double quoted, but it is better to use the optional <b>ARGS</b> argument to specify arguments to the program.
       This  is  because  cmake will then be able to escape spaces in the executable path.  An optional argument
       <b>OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> specifies a variable in which to store the output.  To capture the return  value  of  the
       execution,  provide  a  <b>RETURN_VALUE</b>.   If  <b>OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b>  is  specified, then no output will go to the
       stdout/stderr of the console running cmake.

   <b>export_library_dependencies</b>
       Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy <u>CMP0033</u>.

       Use <u>install(EXPORT)</u> or <u>export()</u> command.

       This command generates an old-style library dependencies file.  Projects requiring  CMake  2.6  or  later
       should  not  use  the  command.   Use  instead the <u>install(EXPORT)</u> command to help export targets from an
       installation tree and the <u>export()</u> command to export targets from a build tree.

       The old-style library dependencies file does not take into account per-configuration names  of  libraries
       or the <u>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</u> target property.

          export_library_dependencies(&lt;file&gt; [APPEND])

       Create a file named <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> that can be included into a CMake listfile with the INCLUDE command.  The file
       will  contain  a  number  of  SET  commands that will set all the variables needed for library dependency
       information.  This should be the last command in the top level CMakeLists.txt file of  the  project.   If
       the  <b>APPEND</b> option is specified, the SET commands will be appended to the given file instead of replacing
       it.

   <b>install_files</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.0: Use the <u>install(FILES)</u> command instead.

       This command has been superseded by the <u>install()</u> command.  It is provided for compatibility  with  older
       CMake  code.  The <b>FILES</b> form is directly replaced by the <b>FILES</b> form of the <u>install()</u> command.  The regexp
       form can be expressed more clearly using the <b>GLOB</b> form of the <u>file()</u> command.

          install_files(&lt;dir&gt; extension file file ...)

       Create rules to install the listed files with the given extension into the given directory.   Only  files
       existing in the current source tree or its corresponding location in the binary tree may be listed.  If a
       file  specified  already  has  an  extension,  that  extension will be removed first.  This is useful for
       providing lists of source files such as foo.cxx when you want the corresponding foo.h to be installed.  A
       typical extension is <b>.h</b>.

          install_files(&lt;dir&gt; regexp)

       Any files in the current source directory that match the regular expression will be installed.

          install_files(&lt;dir&gt; FILES file file ...)

       Any files listed after the <b>FILES</b> keyword will be installed explicitly from the names given.   Full  paths
       are allowed in this form.

       The  directory  <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>  is  relative  to  the  installation  prefix,  which  is  stored  in  the  variable
       <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>.

   <b>install_programs</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.0: Use the <u>install(PROGRAMS)</u> command instead.

       This command has been superseded by the <u>install()</u> command.  It is provided for compatibility  with  older
       CMake  code.   The  <b>FILES</b>  form  is directly replaced by the <b>PROGRAMS</b> form of the <u>install()</u> command.  The
       regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the <b>GLOB</b> form of the <u>file()</u> command.

          install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; file1 file2 [file3 ...])
          install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; FILES file1 [file2 ...])

       Create rules to install the listed programs  into  the  given  directory.   Use  the  <b>FILES</b>  argument  to
       guarantee that the file list version of the command will be used even when there is only one argument.

          install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; regexp)

       In  the  second form any program in the current source directory that matches the regular expression will
       be installed.

       This command is intended to install programs that are not built by cmake, such as shell scripts.  See the
       <b>TARGETS</b> form of the <u>install()</u> command to create installation rules for targets built by cmake.

       The  directory  <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>  is  relative  to  the  installation  prefix,  which  is  stored  in  the  variable
       <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>.

   <b>install_targets</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.0: Use the <u>install(TARGETS)</u> command instead.

       This  command  has been superseded by the <u>install()</u> command.  It is provided for compatibility with older
       CMake code.

          install_targets(&lt;dir&gt; [RUNTIME_DIRECTORY dir] target target)

       Create rules to install the listed targets into the given directory.  The directory <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> is relative  to
       the  installation  prefix, which is stored in the variable <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>.  If <b>RUNTIME_DIRECTORY</b> is
       specified, then on systems with special runtime files (Windows DLL), the files will  be  copied  to  that
       directory.

   <b>load_command</b>
       Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy <u>CMP0031</u>.

       Load a command into a running CMake.

          load_command(COMMAND_NAME &lt;loc1&gt; [loc2 ...])

       The given locations are searched for a library whose name is cmCOMMAND_NAME.  If found, it is loaded as a
       module  and  the command is added to the set of available CMake commands.  Usually, <u>try_compile()</u> is used
       before this command to compile the module.  If the command is successfully loaded a variable named

          CMAKE_LOADED_COMMAND_&lt;COMMAND_NAME&gt;

       will be set to the full path of the module that was loaded.  Otherwise the variable will not be set.

   <b>make_directory</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.0: Use the <u>file(MAKE_DIRECTORY)</u> command instead.

          make_directory(directory)

       Creates the specified directory.  Full paths should be given.  Any parent directories that do  not  exist
       will also be created.  Use with care.

   <b>output_required_files</b>
       Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy <u>CMP0032</u>.

       Approximate C preprocessor dependency scanning.

       This  command  exists  only  because  ancient  CMake  versions  provided  it.  CMake handles preprocessor
       dependency scanning automatically using a more advanced scanner.

          output_required_files(srcfile outputfile)

       Outputs a list of all the source files that are required by the specified <b>srcfile</b>.  This list is  written
       into  <b>outputfile</b>.   This is similar to writing out the dependencies for <b>srcfile</b> except that it jumps from
       <b>.h</b> files into <b>.cxx</b>, <b>.c</b> and <b>.cpp</b> files if possible.

   <b>qt_wrap_cpp</b>
       Deprecated  since  version  3.14:  This  command  was  originally  added  to  support  Qt  3  before  the
       <u>add_custom_command()</u>  command  was  sufficiently  mature.  The <u>FindQt4</u> module provides the <b>qt4_wrap_cpp()</b>
       macro, which should be used instead for Qt 4 projects.  For  projects  using  Qt  5  or  later,  use  the
       equivalent macro provided by Qt itself (e.g. Qt 5 provides <u>qt5_wrap_cpp()</u>).

       Manually create Qt Wrappers.

          qt_wrap_cpp(resultingLibraryName DestName SourceLists ...)

       Produces  moc  files  for all the .h files listed in the SourceLists.  The moc files will be added to the
       library using the <b>DestName</b> source list.

       Consider updating the project to use the <u>AUTOMOC</u> target property instead for  a  more  automated  way  of
       invoking the <b>moc</b> tool.

   <b>qt_wrap_ui</b>
       Deprecated  since  version  3.14:  This  command  was  originally  added  to  support  Qt  3  before  the
       <u>add_custom_command()</u> command was sufficiently mature.  The  <u>FindQt4</u>  module  provides  the  <b>qt4_wrap_ui()</b>
       macro,  which  should  be  used  instead  for  Qt  4 projects.  For projects using Qt 5 or later, use the
       equivalent macro provided by Qt itself (e.g. Qt 5 provides <b>qt5_wrap_ui()</b>).

       Manually create Qt user interfaces Wrappers.

          qt_wrap_ui(resultingLibraryName HeadersDestName
                     SourcesDestName SourceLists ...)

       Produces .h and .cxx files for all the .ui files listed in the <b>SourceLists</b>.  The .h files will  be  added
       to  the  library using the <b>HeadersDestNamesource</b> list.  The .cxx files will be added to the library using
       the <b>SourcesDestNamesource</b> list.

       Consider updating the project to use the <u>AUTOUIC</u> target property instead for  a  more  automated  way  of
       invoking the <b>uic</b> tool.

   <b>remove</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.0: Use the <u>list(REMOVE_ITEM)</u> command instead.

          remove(VAR VALUE VALUE ...)

       Removes  <b>VALUE</b>  from  the  variable  <b>VAR</b>.   This  is typically used to remove entries from a vector (e.g.
       semicolon separated list).  <b>VALUE</b> is expanded.

   <b>subdir_depends</b>
       Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy <u>CMP0029</u>.

       Does nothing.

          subdir_depends(subdir dep1 dep2 ...)

       Does not do anything.  This command  used  to  help  projects  order  parallel  builds  correctly.   This
       functionality is now automatic.

   <b>subdirs</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.0: Use the <u>add_subdirectory()</u> command instead.

       Add a list of subdirectories to the build.

          subdirs(dir1 dir2 ...[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL exclude_dir1 exclude_dir2 ...]
                  [PREORDER] )

       Add  a  list  of  subdirectories  to the build.  The <u>add_subdirectory()</u> command should be used instead of
       <b>subdirs</b> although <b>subdirs</b> will  still  work.   This  will  cause  any  CMakeLists.txt  files  in  the  sub
       directories  to  be  processed  by CMake.  Any directories after the <b>PREORDER</b> flag are traversed first by
       makefile builds,  the  <b>PREORDER</b>  flag  has  no  effect  on  IDE  projects.   Any  directories  after  the
       <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b>  marker  will not be included in the top level makefile or project file.  This is useful
       for having CMake create makefiles or projects for a set of examples in a project.  You would  want  CMake
       to generate makefiles or project files for all the examples at the same time, but you would not want them
       to show up in the top level project or be built each time make is run from the top.

   <b>use_mangled_mesa</b>
       Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy <u>CMP0030</u>.

       Copy mesa headers for use in combination with system GL.

          use_mangled_mesa(PATH_TO_MESA OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)

       The  path  to  mesa  includes,  should contain <b>gl_mangle.h</b>.  The mesa headers are copied to the specified
       output directory.  This allows mangled mesa headers to override other GL headers by being  added  to  the
       include directory path earlier.

   <b>utility_source</b>
       Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy <u>CMP0034</u>.

       Specify the source tree of a third-party utility.

          utility_source(cache_entry executable_name
                         path_to_source [file1 file2 ...])

       When  a third-party utility's source is included in the distribution, this command specifies its location
       and name.  The cache entry will not be set unless the <b>path_to_source</b> and all listed files exist.   It  is
       assumed that the source tree of the utility will have been built before it is needed.

       When  cross  compiling  CMake  will print a warning if a <b>utility_source()</b> command is executed, because in
       many cases it is used to build an executable which is executed later on.  This doesn't  work  when  cross
       compiling,  since  the executable can run only on their target platform.  So in this case the cache entry
       has to be adjusted manually so it points to an executable which is runnable on the build host.

   <b>variable_requires</b>
       Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy <u>CMP0035</u>.

       Use the <u>if()</u> command instead.

       Assert satisfaction of an option's required variables.

          variable_requires(TEST_VARIABLE RESULT_VARIABLE
                            REQUIRED_VARIABLE1
                            REQUIRED_VARIABLE2 ...)

       The first argument (<b>TEST_VARIABLE</b>) is the name of the variable to be tested, if that  variable  is  false
       nothing  else  is done.  If <b>TEST_VARIABLE</b> is true, then the next argument (<b>RESULT_VARIABLE</b>) is a variable
       that is set to true if all the required variables are set.  The rest of the arguments are variables  that
       must be true or not set to <b>NOTFOUND</b> to avoid an error.  If any are not true, an error is reported.

   <b>write_file</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.0: Use the <u>file(WRITE)</u> command instead.

          write_file(filename "message to write"... [APPEND])

       The  first  argument  is the file name, the rest of the arguments are messages to write.  If the argument
       <b>APPEND</b> is specified, then the message will be appended.

       NOTE 1: <u>file(WRITE)</u>  and <u>file(APPEND)</u>  do exactly the same as this one but add some more functionality.

       NOTE 2: When using <b>write_file</b> the produced file cannot be used as  an  input  to  CMake  (CONFIGURE_FILE,
       source  file ...) because it will lead to an infinite loop.  Use <u>configure_file()</u> if you want to generate
       input files to CMake.
