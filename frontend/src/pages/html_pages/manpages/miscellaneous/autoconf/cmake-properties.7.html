       cmake-properties - CMake Properties Reference

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>GLOBAL</b> <b>SCOPE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS</b>
       Allow duplicate custom targets to be created.

       Normally  CMake  requires  that  all  targets  built in a project have globally unique logical names (see
       policy <u>CMP0002</u>).  This is necessary to generate meaningful project file names in <u>Xcode</u> and <u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>
       <u>Generators</u> IDE generators.  It also allows the target names to be referenced unambiguously.

       Makefile  generators  are  capable  of supporting duplicate <u>add_custom_target()</u> names.  For projects that
       care only about <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> and do not wish to support <u>Xcode</u>  or  <u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u>  IDE
       generators,  one  may  set  this property to <b>True</b> to allow duplicate custom targets.  The property allows
       multiple <u>add_custom_target()</u> command calls in different directories to  specify  the  same  target  name.
       However,  setting  this  property  will  cause  non-Makefile generators to produce an error and refuse to
       generate the project.

   <b>AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Name of the  <u>source_group()</u> for <u>AUTOMOC</u>, <u>AUTORCC</u> and <u>AUTOUIC</u> generated files.

       Files generated by <u>AUTOMOC</u>, <u>AUTORCC</u> and <u>AUTOUIC</u> are not always known  at  configure  time  and  therefore
       can't  be  passed  to  <u>source_group()</u>.   <b>AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP</b> can be used instead to generate or select a
       source group for <u>AUTOMOC</u>, <u>AUTORCC</u> and <u>AUTOUIC</u> generated files.

       For <u>AUTOMOC</u>, <u>AUTORCC</u> and <u>AUTOUIC</u> specific overrides see  <u>AUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP</u>,  <u>AUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP</u>  and
       <u>AUTOUIC_SOURCE_GROUP</u> respectively.

   <b>AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER</b>
       Name  of <u>FOLDER</u> for <b>*_autogen</b> targets that are added automatically by CMake for targets for which <u>AUTOMOC</u>
       is enabled.

       If not set, CMake uses the <u>FOLDER</u> property of the parent target as a default  value  for  this  property.
       See also the documentation for the <u>FOLDER</u> target property and the <u>AUTOMOC</u> target property.

   <b>AUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Name of the  <u>source_group()</u> for <u>AUTOMOC</u> generated files.

       When set this is used instead of <u>AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP</u> for files generated by <u>AUTOMOC</u>.

   <b>AUTOMOC_TARGETS_FOLDER</b>
       Name  of <u>FOLDER</u> for <b>*_autogen</b> targets that are added automatically by CMake for targets for which <u>AUTOMOC</u>
       is enabled.

       This property is obsolete.  Use <u>AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER</u> instead.

       If not set, CMake uses the <u>FOLDER</u> property of the parent target as a default  value  for  this  property.
       See also the documentation for the <u>FOLDER</u> target property and the <u>AUTOMOC</u> target property.

   <b>AUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Name of the  <u>source_group()</u> for <u>AUTORCC</u> generated files.

       When set this is used instead of <u>AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP</u> for files generated by <u>AUTORCC</u>.

   <b>AUTOUIC_SOURCE_GROUP</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       Name of the  <u>source_group()</u> for <u>AUTOUIC</u> generated files.

       When set this is used instead of <u>AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP</u> for files generated by <u>AUTOUIC</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_C_KNOWN_FEATURES</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       List of C features known to this version of CMake.

       The features known to this version of CMake are listed below.

   <b>High</b> <b>level</b> <b>meta</b> <b>features</b> <b>indicating</b> <b>C++</b> <b>standard</b> <b>support</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       The following meta features indicate general support for the associated language standard.   It  reflects

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          If the compiler's default standard level is at least that of the requested feature, CMake may omit the
          <b>-std=</b> flag.  The flag may still be added if the compiler's default extensions mode does not match  the
          <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_EXTENSIONS</u> target property, or if the <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</u> target property is set.

   <b>Low</b> <b>level</b> <b>individual</b> <b>compile</b> <b>features</b>
       For  C++  11  and  C++  14,  compilers were sometimes slow to implement certain language features.  CMake
       provided some individual compile features to help  projects  determine  whether  specific  features  were
       available.   These  individual features are now less relevant and projects should generally prefer to use
       the high level meta features instead.  Individual compile features are not provided for C++ 17 or later.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u> manual  for  further  discussion  of  the  use  of  individual  compile
       features.

       The value must be a semi-colon separated list of configuration names.  Currently this  property  is  used
       only by the <u>target_link_libraries()</u> command.  Additional uses may be defined in the future.

       This  property  must  be set at the top level of the project and before the first <u>target_link_libraries()</u>
       command invocation.  If any entry in the list does not match a valid configuration for  the  project  the
       behavior is undefined.

   <b>DISABLED_FEATURES</b>
       List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.

       List  of  features  which  are  disabled  during  the CMake run.  By default it contains the names of all
       packages which were not found.  This is determined using the <b>&lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND</b> variables.  Packages which  are
       searched  <b>QUIET</b>  are not listed.  A project can add its own features to this list.  This property is used
       by the macros in <b>FeatureSummary.cmake</b>.

   <b>ECLIPSE_EXTRA_CPROJECT_CONTENTS</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       Additional contents to be inserted into the generated Eclipse cproject file.

       The cproject file defines the CDT specific information. Some third party IDE's are based on Eclipse  with
       the  addition  of  other  information specific to that IDE.  Through this property, it is possible to add
       this additional contents to the generated project.  It is expected to contain valid XML.

       Also see the <u>ECLIPSE_EXTRA_NATURES</u> property.

   <b>ECLIPSE_EXTRA_NATURES</b>
       List of natures to add to the generated Eclipse project file.

       Eclipse projects specify language plugins by using natures. This property should be  set  to  the  unique
       identifier for a nature (which looks like a Java package name).

       Also see the <u>ECLIPSE_EXTRA_CPROJECT_CONTENTS</u> property.

   <b>ENABLED_FEATURES</b>
       List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.

       List  of  features  which  are  enabled  during  the  CMake run.  By default it contains the names of all
       packages which were found.  This is determined using the  <b>&lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND</b>  variables.   Packages  which  are
       searched  <b>QUIET</b>  are not listed.  A project can add its own features to this list.  This property is used
       by the macros in <b>FeatureSummary.cmake</b>.

   <b>ENABLED_LANGUAGES</b>
       Read-only property that contains the list of currently enabled languages

       Set to list of currently enabled languages.

   <b>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Whether the <u>find_library()</u> command should automatically search <b>lib32</b> directories.

       <b>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS</b>  is  a  boolean  specifying  whether  the  <u>find_library()</u>   command   should
       automatically  search the <b>lib32</b> variant of directories called <b>lib</b> in the search path when building 32-bit
       binaries.

       See also the <u>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX</u> variable.

   <b>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS</b>
       Whether <u>find_library()</u> should automatically search lib64 directories.

       FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS  is  a  boolean  specifying  whether  the  <u>find_library()</u>   command   should
       automatically  search the lib64 variant of directories called lib in the search path when building 64-bit
       binaries.

       See also the <u>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX</u> variable.

   <b>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Whether the <u>find_library()</u> command should automatically search <b>libx32</b> directories.

       <b>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS</b>  is  a  boolean  specifying  whether  the  <u>find_library()</u>  command   should
       automatically  search  the  <b>libx32</b>  variant  of  directories  called <b>lib</b> in the search path when building
       x32-abi binaries.

       See also the <u>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX</u> variable.

   <b>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_OPENBSD_VERSIONING</b>
       Whether <u>find_library()</u> should find OpenBSD-style shared libraries.

       This property is a boolean specifying whether the <u>find_library()</u> command  should  find  shared  libraries
       with  OpenBSD-style  versioned  extension: ".so.&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;".  The property is set to true on OpenBSD
       and false on other platforms.

   <b>GENERATOR_IS_MULTI_CONFIG</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Read-only property that is true on multi-configuration generators.

       True when using a multi-configuration generator such as:

       • <u>Ninja</u> <u>Multi-Config</u>

       • <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>

       • <u>Xcode</u>

       Multi-config  generators  use  <u>CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES</u>  as  the  set  of  configurations   and   ignore
       <u>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</u>.

   <b>GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE</b>
       Enable global target dependency graph debug mode.

       CMake  automatically  analyzes  the global inter-target dependency graph at the beginning of native build
       system generation.  This property causes it to display details of its analysis to stderr.

   <b>GLOBAL_DEPENDS_NO_CYCLES</b>
       Disallow global target dependency graph cycles.

       CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target dependency graph at the beginning  of  native  build
       system generation.  It reports an error if the dependency graph contains a cycle that does not consist of
       all  STATIC  library  targets.   This  property tells CMake to disallow all cycles completely, even among
       static libraries.

   <b>INSTALL_PARALLEL</b>
       Added in version 3.30.

       Enables parallel installation option for a project. The install code for  each  subdirectory  added  with
       <b>add_subdirectory</b> can run independently.

       When  using  the  Ninja  generator,  setting  this  property to <b>ON</b>, causes <b>install/local</b> targets have the
       console pool disabled, allowing them to run concurrently.

       This property also provides the  target  <b>install/parallel</b>,  which  has  an  explicit  dependency  on  the
       <b>install/local</b> target for each subdirectory.
          Added in version 3.31.

          When  this  property  is <b>ON</b>, <b>cmake</b> <b>--install</b> can be given the <b>-j</b> <b>&lt;jobs&gt;</b> or <b>--parallel</b> <b>&lt;jobs&gt;</b> option to
          specify a maximum number of jobs.  The <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PARALLEL_LEVEL</u> environment variable  specifies  a
          default parallel level if this option is not provided.

       Calls  to  <u>install(CODE)</u>  or  <u>install(SCRIPT)</u>  might  depend on actions performed by an earlier <u>install()</u>
       command in a different directory such as files installed or variable settings. If the  project  has  such
       order-dependent  installation  logic, parallel installation should be not be enabled, in order to prevent
       possible race conditions.

   <b>IN_TRY_COMPILE</b>
       Read-only property that is true during a try-compile configuration.

       True when building a project inside a <u>try_compile()</u> or <u>try_run()</u> command.

   <b>JOB_POOLS</b>
       Ninja only: List of available pools.

       A pool is a named integer property and defines the maximum number of concurrent jobs which can be started
       by a rule assigned to the pool.  The <b>JOB_POOLS</b> property is a semicolon-separated list of pairs using  the
       syntax <b>NAME=integer</b> (without a space after the equality sign).

       For instance:

          set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY JOB_POOLS two_jobs=2 ten_jobs=10)

       Defined  pools  could  be  used globally by setting <u>CMAKE_JOB_POOL_COMPILE</u> and <u>CMAKE_JOB_POOL_LINK</u> or per
       target by setting the target properties <u>JOB_POOL_COMPILE</u> and <u>JOB_POOL_LINK</u>.  <u>Custom</u> <u>commands</u>  and  <u>custom</u>
       <u>targets</u>  can  specify  pools  using  the  option <b>JOB_POOL</b>.  Using a pool that is not defined by <b>JOB_POOLS</b>
       causes an error by ninja at build time.

       If not set, this property uses the value of the <u>CMAKE_JOB_POOLS</u> variable.

       Build targets provided by CMake that are meant for individual  interactive  use,  such  as  <b>install</b>,  are
       placed in the <b>console</b> pool automatically.

   <b>PACKAGES_FOUND</b>
       List of packages which were found during the CMake run.

       List  of  packages which were found during the CMake run.  Whether a package has been found is determined
       using the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables.

   <b>PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND</b>
       List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.

       List of packages which were not found during the  CMake  run.   Whether  a  package  has  been  found  is
       determined using the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables.

   <b>PREDEFINED_TARGETS_FOLDER</b>
       Name of FOLDER for targets that are added automatically by CMake.

       If  not  set,  CMake uses "CMakePredefinedTargets" as a default value for this property.  Targets such as
       INSTALL, PACKAGE and RUN_TESTS will be organized into this FOLDER.  See also the  documentation  for  the
       <u>FOLDER</u> target property.

   <b>PROPAGATE_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES_TO_TRY_COMPILE</b>
       Added in version 3.30.

       When  this  global  property  is set to true, the <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES</u> variable is propagated
       into <u>try_compile()</u> calls that use the <u>whole-project</u> <u>signature</u>.  Calls to the <u>source</u>  <u>file</u>  <u>signature</u>  are
       not affected by this property.  <b>PROPAGATE_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES_TO_TRY_COMPILE</b> is unset by default.

       For  <u>dependency</u>  <u>providers</u>  that want to be enabled in whole-project <u>try_compile()</u> calls, set this global
       property to true just before  or  after  registering  the  provider.   Note  that  all  files  listed  in
       <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES</u>  will  need  to  be  able to handle being included in such <u>try_compile()</u>
       calls, and it is the user's responsibility to ensure this.

   <b>REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES</b>
       If set, report any undefined properties to this file.

       If this property is set to a filename then when CMake runs it will report  any  properties  or  variables
       that were accessed but not defined into the filename specified in this property.

   <b>RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE</b>
       Specify a launcher for compile rules.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This  property  is  intended  for  internal  use  by <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u>.  Projects and developers should use the
          <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LAUNCHER</u> target properties or the associated <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LAUNCHER</u>  variables
          instead.

       <u>Makefile</u>  <u>Generators</u>  and  the  <u>Ninja</u>  generator prefix compiler commands with the given launcher command
       line.  This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build  problems  with  high  granularity.   Other
       generators ignore this property because their underlying build systems provide no hook to wrap individual
       commands with a launcher.

   <b>RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM</b>
       Specify a launcher for custom rules.

       <u>Makefile</u>  <u>Generators</u> and the <u>Ninja</u> generator prefix custom commands with the given launcher command line.
       This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems with high granularity.  Other  generators
       ignore  this  property because their underlying build systems provide no hook to wrap individual commands
       with a launcher.

   <b>RULE_LAUNCH_LINK</b>
       Specify a launcher for link rules.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property is intended for internal use by  <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u>.   Projects  and  developers  should  use  the
          <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_LAUNCHER</u>  target  properties  or  the  associated <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_LAUNCHER</u> variables
          instead.

       <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> and the <u>Ninja</u> generator prefix link and archive  commands  with  the  given  launcher
       command  line.   This  is  intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems with high granularity.
       Other generators ignore this property because their underlying build systems  provide  no  hook  to  wrap
       individual commands with a launcher.

   <b>RULE_MESSAGES</b>
       Specify whether to report a message for each make rule.

       This  property  specifies  whether Makefile generators should add a progress message describing what each
       build rule does.  If the property is not set the default is ON.  Set  the  property  to  OFF  to  disable
       granular messages and report only as each target completes.  This is intended to allow scripted builds to
       avoid  the  build  time  cost of detailed reports.  If a <u>CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES</u> cache entry exists its value
       initializes the value of this property.  Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.

   <b>TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS</b>
       Set if shared libraries may be named like archives.

       On AIX shared libraries may be named "lib&lt;name&gt;.a".  This property is set to true on such platforms.

   <b>TARGET_MESSAGES</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Specify whether to report the completion of each target.

       This property specifies whether <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> should add a progress message  describing  that  each
       target  has  been  completed.   If the property is not set the default is <b>ON</b>.  Set the property to <b>OFF</b> to
       disable target completion messages.

       This option is intended to reduce build output when little or no work needs to be done to bring the build
       tree up to date.

       If a <b>CMAKE_TARGET_MESSAGES</b> cache entry exists its value initializes the value of this property.

       Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.

       See the counterpart property <u>RULE_MESSAGES</u> to disable everything except for target completion messages.

   <b>TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS</b>
       Does the target platform support shared libraries.

       <b>TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS</b>  is  a  boolean  specifying  whether  the  target  platform  supports  shared
       libraries.   Basically  all current general purpose OS do so, the exceptions are usually embedded systems
       with no or special OSs.

   <b>USE_FOLDERS</b>
       Controls whether to use the <u>FOLDER</u> target property to  organize  targets  into  folders.   The  value  of
       <b>USE_FOLDERS</b> at the end of the top level <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file is what determines the behavior.

       Changed in version 3.26: CMake treats this property as <b>ON</b> by default.  See policy <u>CMP0143</u>.

       Not  all  CMake  generators  support  recording  folder details for targets.  The <u>Xcode</u> and <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u>
       generators are examples of generators that do.  Similarly, not all IDEs support presenting targets  using
       folder hierarchies, even if the CMake generator used provides the necessary information.

   <b>XCODE_EMIT_EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Control emission of <b>EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME</b> by the <u>Xcode</u> generator.

       It  is required for building the same target with multiple SDKs. A common use case is the parallel use of
       <b>iphoneos</b> and <b>iphonesimulator</b> SDKs.

       Three different states possible that control when the <u>Xcode</u> generator emits  the  <b>EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME</b>
       variable:

       • If set to <b>ON</b> it will always be emitted

       • If set to <b>OFF</b> it will never be emitted

       • If  unset  (the  default) it will only be emitted when the project was configured for an embedded Xcode
         SDK like iOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS or any of the simulators.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          When this behavior is enable for generated Xcode projects, the <b>EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME</b>  variable  will
          leak into <u>Generator</u> <u>expressions</u> like <b>TARGET_FILE</b> and will render those mostly unusable.

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       A <u>;-list</u> of files or directories that will be removed as a part of the global <b>clean</b> target.  It is useful
       for  specifying  generated  files or directories that are used by multiple targets or by CMake itself, or
       that are generated in ways which cannot be captured as outputs or byproducts of custom commands.

       If an additional clean file is specific to a single target only, then the  <u>ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES</u>  target
       property would usually be a better choice than this directory property.

       Relative paths are allowed and are interpreted relative to the current binary directory.

       Contents of <b>ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       This property only works for the <u>Ninja</u> and the Makefile generators.  It is ignored by other generators.

   <b>BINARY_DIR</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       This  read-only  directory  property  reports  absolute path to the binary directory corresponding to the
       source on which it is read.

   <b>BUILDSYSTEM_TARGETS</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       This read-only directory property contains a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of buildsystem targets added in the
       directory by calls to the <u>add_library()</u>, <u>add_executable()</u>, and <u>add_custom_target()</u>  commands.   The  list
       does not include any <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> or <u>Alias</u> <u>Targets</u>, but does include <u>Interface</u> <u>Libraries</u>.  Each entry
       in  the  list  is  the  logical  name  of a target, suitable to pass to the <u>get_property()</u> command <b>TARGET</b>
       option.

       See also the <u>IMPORTED_TARGETS</u> directory property.

   <b>CACHE_VARIABLES</b>
       List of cache variables available in the current directory.

       This read-only property specifies the list of CMake cache variables currently defined.   It  is  intended
       for debugging purposes.

   <b>CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM</b>
       Set  to  true to tell <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> not to remove the outputs of custom commands for this directory
       during the <b>make</b> <b>clean</b> operation.  This is ignored on other generators  because  it  is  not  possible  to
       implement.

   <b>CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS</b>
       Tell  CMake about additional input files to the configuration process.  If any named file is modified the
       build system will re-run CMake to re-configure the file and generate the build system again.

       Specify files as a semicolon-separated list of paths.  Relative paths are interpreted as relative to  the
       current source directory.

   <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b>
       Preprocessor definitions for compiling a directory's sources.

       This  property  specifies  the  list  of  options  given  so  far  to  the  <u>add_compile_definitions()</u> (or
       <u>add_definitions()</u>) command.

       The <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b> property may be set to a semicolon-separated  list  of  preprocessor  definitions
       using  the  syntax  <b>VAR</b>  or  <b>VAR=value</b>.   Function-style  definitions  are  not  supported.   CMake  will
       automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may
       require escapes to specify some values).

       This property will be initialized in each directory by its value in the directory's parent.

       CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported by the native build tool.

       Added in version 3.26: Any leading <b>-D</b> on an item will be removed.

       Disclaimer: Most  native  build  tools  have  poor  support  for  escaping  certain  values.   CMake  has
       work-arounds  for many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does
       not seem to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape sequences to
       the value.  Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake that  has  improved  escape  support.
       Instead  consider  defining  the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.  Known
       limitations include:

          #          - broken almost everywhere
          ;          - broken in VS IDE 7.0 and Borland Makefiles
          ,          - broken in VS IDE
          %          - broken in some cases in NMake
          &amp; |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
          ^ &lt; &gt; \"   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

       CMake does not reject these values outright because they do work in some cases.  Use with caution.

       Contents of <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b> may  use  "generator  expressions"  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See  the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

       The   corresponding  <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>  property  may  be  set  to  specify  per-configuration
       definitions.  Generator expressions should be preferred instead of setting the alternative property.

   <b>COMPILE_OPTIONS</b>
       List of options to pass to the compiler.

       This property holds a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of options  given  so  far  to  the  <u>add_compile_options()</u>
       command.

       This  property  is used to initialize the <u>COMPILE_OPTIONS</u> target property when a target is created, which
       is used by the generators to set the options for the compiler.

       Contents  of  <b>COMPILE_OPTIONS</b>  may  use  "generator  expressions"  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See   the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>DEFINITIONS</b>
       For CMake 2.4 compatibility only.  Use <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u> instead.

       This read-only property specifies the list of flags given so far to the <u>add_definitions()</u> command.  It is
       intended for debugging purposes.  Use the <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u> directory property instead.

       This built-in read-only property does not exist if policy <u>CMP0059</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>.

   <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b>
       Set  this  directory  property  to  a  true value on a subdirectory to exclude its targets from the "all"
       target of its ancestors.  If excluded, running e.g. <b>make</b> in the parent directory will not  build  targets
       the  subdirectory by default.  This does not affect the "all" target of the subdirectory itself.  Running
       e.g. <b>make</b> inside the subdirectory will still build its targets.

       <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b> is meant for when the subdirectory contains a separate  part  of  the  project  that  is
       useful, but not necessary, such as a set of examples, or e.g. an integrated 3rd party library.  Typically
       the  subdirectory should contain its own <u>project()</u> command invocation so that a full build system will be
       generated in the subdirectory (such as a Visual  Studio  IDE  solution  file).   Note  that  inter-target
       dependencies  supersede  this  exclusion.  If a target built by the parent project depends on a target in
       the subdirectory, the dependee target will be included in the parent project build system to satisfy  the
       dependency.

       If the <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b> argument is provided, it has the following effects:

       • Targets  defined  in  the  subdirectory  or  below will not be included in the <b>ALL</b> target of the parent
         directory.  Those targets must be built explicitly by the user, or be a dependency  of  another  target
         that will be built.

       • Targets defined in the subdirectory or below will be excluded from IDE project files.

       • Any  install  rules  defined  in  the  subdirectory or below will be ignored when installing the parent
         directory.

       Note that these effects are not the same as those for the <u>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</u> target property.

   <b>IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM</b>
       Specify <b>#include</b> line transforms for dependencies in a directory.

       This property specifies rules to transform macro-like <b>#include</b> lines during implicit dependency  scanning
       of  C  and  C++  source files.  The list of rules must be semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
       <b>A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%</b> (the <b>%</b> must be literal).  During dependency scanning occurrences of  <b>A_MACRO(...)</b>
       on  <b>#include</b>  lines  will  be replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for <b>%</b>.  For
       example, the entry

          MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;

       will convert lines of the form

          #include MYDIR(myheader.h)

       to

          #include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;

       allowing the dependency to be followed.

       This property applies to sources in all targets within a directory.  The property value is initialized in
       each directory by its value in the directory's parent.

   <b>IMPORTED_TARGETS</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       This read-only directory property contains a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u>  added  in  the
       directory  by  calls  to  the <u>add_library()</u> and <u>add_executable()</u> commands.  Each entry in the list is the
       logical name of a target, suitable to pass to the <u>get_property()</u> command <b>TARGET</b> option when called in the
       same directory.

       See also the <u>BUILDSYSTEM_TARGETS</u> directory property.

   <b>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b>
       List of preprocessor include file search directories.

       This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the <u>include_directories()</u> command.

       This property is used to  populate  the  <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>  target  property,  which  is  used  by  the
       generators to set the include directories for the compiler.

       In  addition to accepting values from that command, values may be set directly on any directory using the
       <u>set_property()</u> command, and can be set on the  current  directory  using  the  <u>set_directory_properties()</u>
       command.   A directory gets its initial value from its parent directory if it has one.  The initial value
       of the <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> target property comes from the value of this  property.   Both  directory  and
       target   property  values  are  adjusted  by  calls  to  the  <u>include_directories()</u>  command.   Calls  to
       <u>set_property()</u> or <u>set_directory_properties()</u>, however, will update the directory property  value  without
       updating  target  property  values.   Therefore  direct  property  updates  must  be made before calls to
       <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u> for targets they are meant to affect.

       The target property values are used by the generators to set the include paths for the compiler.

       Contents of <b>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b> may  use  "generator  expressions"  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See  the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</b>
       Include file scanning regular expression.

       This  property  specifies  the  regular expression used during dependency scanning to match include files
       that should be followed.  See the <u>include_regular_expression()</u> command for a high-level interface to  set
       this property.

   <b>LABELS</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       Specify  a  list  of  text  labels  associated  with  a  directory and all of its subdirectories. This is
       equivalent to setting the <u>LABELS</u> target property and the <u>LABELS</u> test property on all targets and tests in
       the current directory and subdirectories. Note: Launchers must enabled to propagate labels to targets.

       The <u>CMAKE_DIRECTORY_LABELS</u> variable can be used to initialize this property.

       The list is reported in dashboard submissions.

   <b>LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
       List of linker search directories.

       This property holds a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of  directories  and  is  typically  populated  using  the
       <u>link_directories()</u> command.  It gets its initial value from its parent directory, if it has one.

       The  directory  property  is  used  to  initialize  the <u>LINK_DIRECTORIES</u> target property when a target is
       created.  That target property is used by the generators to set the library search  directories  for  the
       linker.

       Contents  of  <b>LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>  may  use  "generator  expressions"  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See  the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>LINK_OPTIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       List of options to use for the link step of shared library, module and executable targets as well as  the
       device link step.

       This property holds a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of options given so far to the <u>add_link_options()</u> command.

       This  property  is used to initialize the <u>LINK_OPTIONS</u> target property when a target is created, which is
       used by the generators to set the options for the compiler.

       Contents  of  <b>LINK_OPTIONS</b>  may  use  "generator  expressions"  with  the   syntax   <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.    See   the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>LISTFILE_STACK</b>
       The current stack of listfiles being processed.

       This  property  is mainly useful when trying to debug errors in your CMake scripts.  It returns a list of
       what list files are currently being processed, in order.  So if one listfile does  an  <u>include()</u>  command
       then that is effectively pushing the included listfile onto the stack.

   <b>MACROS</b>
       List of macro commands available in the current directory.

       This  read-only  property  specifies  the  list  of  CMake  macros currently defined.  It is intended for
       debugging purposes.  See the <u>macro()</u> command.

   <b>PARENT_DIRECTORY</b>
       Source directory that added current subdirectory.

       This read-only property specifies the source directory that added  the  current  source  directory  as  a
       subdirectory of the build.  In the top-level directory the value is the empty-string.

   <b>RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE</b>
       Specify a launcher for compile rules.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This  property  is  intended  for  internal  use  by <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u>.  Projects and developers should use the
          <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LAUNCHER</u> target properties or the associated <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LAUNCHER</u>  variables
          instead.

       See  the  <u>global</u>  <u>property</u>  of  the  same  name  for  details.   This overrides the global property for a
       directory.

   <b>RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM</b>
       Specify a launcher for custom rules.

       See the global property of the same  name  for  details.   This  overrides  the  global  property  for  a
       directory.

   <b>RULE_LAUNCH_LINK</b>
       Specify a launcher for link rules.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This  property  is  intended  for  internal  use  by <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u>.  Projects and developers should use the
          <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_LAUNCHER</u> target properties  or  the  associated  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_LAUNCHER</u>  variables
          instead.

       See  the  <u>global</u>  <u>property</u>  of  the  same  name  for  details.   This overrides the global property for a
       directory.

   <b>SOURCE_DIR</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       This read-only directory property reports absolute path to the source directory on which it is read.

   <b>SUBDIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       This read-only directory property contains a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of subdirectories processed so  far
       by the <u>add_subdirectory()</u> or <u>subdirs()</u> commands.  Each entry is the absolute path to the source directory
       (containing  the  <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file).  This is suitable to pass to the <u>get_property()</u> command <b>DIRECTORY</b>
       option.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The <u>subdirs()</u> command does not process its arguments  until  after  the  calling  directory  is  fully
          processed.  Therefore looking up this property in the current directory will not see them.

   <b>SYSTEM</b>
       Added in version 3.25.

       This directory property is used to initialize the <u>SYSTEM</u> target property for non-imported targets created
       in  that  directory.   It is set to true by <u>add_subdirectory()</u> and <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u> when the <b>SYSTEM</b>
       option is given as an argument to those commands.

   <b>TESTS</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       List of tests.

       This read-only property holds a <u>semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  of  tests  defined  so  far,  in  the  current
       directory, by the <u>add_test()</u> command.

   <b>TEST_INCLUDE_FILES</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       A list of cmake files that will be included when ctest is run.

       If  you  specify  <b>TEST_INCLUDE_FILES</b>, those files will be included and processed when ctest is run on the
       directory.

   <b>VARIABLES</b>
       List of variables defined in the current directory.

       This read-only property specifies the list of CMake variables currently  defined.   It  is  intended  for
       debugging purposes.

   <b>VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_&lt;section&gt;</b>
       Specify a postSolution global section in Visual Studio.

       Setting a property like this generates an entry of the following form in the solution file:

          GlobalSection(&lt;section&gt;) = postSolution
            &lt;contents based on property value&gt;
          EndGlobalSection

       The  property  must  be  set  to  a  semicolon-separated list of <b>key=value</b> pairs.  Each such pair will be
       transformed into an entry in the solution global section.  Whitespace around key and  value  is  ignored.
       List elements which do not contain an equal sign are skipped.

       This  property  only works for <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>; it is ignored on other generators.  The property
       only applies when set on a directory whose <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> contains a <u>project()</u> command.

       Note that CMake generates postSolution sections <b>ExtensibilityGlobals</b> and <b>ExtensibilityAddIns</b> by  default.
       If  you  set  the  corresponding  property,  it  will override the default section.  For example, setting
       <b>VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_ExtensibilityGlobals</b>   will    override    the    default    contents    of    the
       <b>ExtensibilityGlobals</b>  section,  while  keeping  ExtensibilityAddIns  on its default.  However, CMake will
       always add a <b>SolutionGuid</b> to the <b>ExtensibilityGlobals</b> section if it is not specified explicitly.

   <b>VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_PRE_&lt;section&gt;</b>
       Specify a preSolution global section in Visual Studio.

       Setting a property like this generates an entry of the following form in the solution file:

          GlobalSection(&lt;section&gt;) = preSolution
            &lt;contents based on property value&gt;
          EndGlobalSection

       The property must be set to a semicolon-separated list of  <b>key=value</b>  pairs.   Each  such  pair  will  be
       transformed  into  an  entry in the solution global section.  Whitespace around key and value is ignored.
       List elements which do not contain an equal sign are skipped.

       This property only works for <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>; it is ignored on other generators.   The  property
       only applies when set on a directory whose <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> contains a <u>project()</u> command.

   <b>VS_STARTUP_PROJECT</b>
       Added in version 3.6.

       Specify the default startup project in a Visual Studio solution.

       The  <u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u> create a <b>.sln</b> file for each directory whose <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file calls the
       <u>project()</u> command.  Set this property in the same directory as a <u>project()</u>  command  call  (e.g.  in  the
       top-level  <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>  file)  to  specify  the default startup project for the corresponding solution
       file.

       The property must be set to the name of an existing target.  This will cause that project  to  be  listed
       first in the generated solution file causing Visual Studio to make it the startup project if the solution
       has never been opened before.

       If this property is not specified, then the <b>ALL_BUILD</b> project will be the default.

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>TARGETS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       A  <u>;-list</u>  of  files or directories that will be removed as a part of the global <b>clean</b> target.  It can be
       used to specify files and directories that are generated as part of  building  the  target  or  that  are
       directly associated with the target in some way (e.g. created as a result of running the target).

       For  custom  targets, if such files can be captured as outputs or byproducts instead, then that should be
       preferred over adding them to this property.  If an additional clean file is used by multiple targets  or
       isn't  target-specific,  then  the  <u>ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES</u> directory property may be the more appropriate
       property to use.

       Relative paths are allowed and are interpreted relative to the current binary directory.

       Contents of <b>ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       This property only works for the <u>Ninja</u> and the Makefile generators.  It is ignored by other generators.

   <b>AIX_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       On AIX, CMake automatically exports all symbols from shared libraries,  and  from  executables  with  the
       <u>ENABLE_EXPORTS</u>  target  property  set.  Explicitly disable this boolean property to suppress the behavior
       and export no symbols by default.  In this case it is expected that the project will use other  means  to
       export some symbols.

       This  property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_AIX_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS</u> variable if it is set when
       a target is created.

   <b>AIX_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHIVE</b>
       Added in version 3.31.

       On AIX, enable creation of a shared library archive.  This places the shared object <b>.so</b>  file  inside  an
       archive <b>.a</b> file.

       By  default,  CMake creates shared libraries on AIX as plain shared object <b>.so</b> files for consistency with
       other UNIX platforms.  Alternatively, set this property to a  true  value  to  create  a  shared  library
       archive instead, as is AIX convention.

       The  shared object name in the archive encodes version information from the <u>SOVERSION</u> target property, if
       set, and otherwise from the <u>VERSION</u> target property, if set.

       This property defaults to <u>CMAKE_AIX_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHIVE</u> if that variable is set  when  a  non-imported
       <b>SHARED</b>   library   target   is  created  by  <u>add_library()</u>.   Imported  targets  must  explicitly  enable
       <b>AIX_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHIVE</b> if they import an AIX shared library archive.

   <b>ALIAS_GLOBAL</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       Read-only property indicating of whether an <u>ALIAS</u> <u>target</u> is globally visible.

       The boolean value of this property is <b>TRUE</b> for aliases  to  <u>IMPORTED</u>  <u>targets</u>  created  with  the  <b>GLOBAL</b>
       options  to  <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u>, <b>FALSE</b> otherwise. It is undefined for targets built within
       the project.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Promoting an <u>IMPORTED</u> <u>target</u> from <b>LOCAL</b> to <b>GLOBAL</b> scope  by  changing  the  value  or  <u>IMPORTED_GLOBAL</u>
          target property do not change the scope of local aliases.

   <b>ALIASED_TARGET</b>
       Name of target aliased by this target.

       If this is an <u>Alias</u> <u>Target</u>, this property contains the name of the target aliased.

   <b>ANDROID_ANT_ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Set  the  additional  options for Android Ant build system. This is a string value containing all command
       line  options  for  the  Ant   build.    This   property   is   initialized   by   the   value   of   the
       <u>CMAKE_ANDROID_ANT_ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS</u> variable if it is set when a target is created.

   <b>ANDROID_API</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       When  <u>Cross</u>  <u>Compiling</u> <u>for</u> <u>Android</u> <u>with</u> <u>NVIDIA</u> <u>Nsight</u> <u>Tegra</u> <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Edition</u>, this property sets the
       Android target API version (e.g. <b>15</b>).  The version number must  be  a  positive  decimal  integer.   This
       property  is  initialized  by  the  value of the <u>CMAKE_ANDROID_API</u> variable if it is set when a target is
       created.

   <b>ANDROID_API_MIN</b>
       Added in version 3.2.

       Set the Android MIN API version (e.g. <b>9</b>).  The version number must be a positive decimal  integer.   This
       property  is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_ANDROID_API_MIN</u> variable if it is set when a target is
       created.  Native code builds using this API version.

   <b>ANDROID_ARCH</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       When <u>Cross</u> <u>Compiling</u> <u>for</u> <u>Android</u> <u>with</u> <u>NVIDIA</u> <u>Nsight</u> <u>Tegra</u> <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Edition</u>, this property  sets  the
       Android target architecture.

       This is a string property that could be set to the one of the following values:

       • <b>armv7-a</b>: "ARMv7-A (armv7-a)"

       • <b>armv7-a-hard</b>: "ARMv7-A, hard-float ABI (armv7-a)"

       • <b>arm64-v8a</b>: "ARMv8-A, 64bit (arm64-v8a)"

       • <b>x86</b>: "x86 (x86)"

       • <b>x86_64</b>: "x86_64 (x86_64)"

       This  property  is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH</u> variable if it is set when a target
       is created.

   <b>ANDROID_ASSETS_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Set the Android assets directories to copy into the main  assets  folder  before  build.  This  a  string
       property  that  contains the directory paths separated by semicolon.  This property is initialized by the
       value of the <u>CMAKE_ANDROID_ASSETS_DIRECTORIES</u> variable if it is set when a target is created.

   <b>ANDROID_GUI</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       When <u>Cross</u> <u>Compiling</u> <u>for</u> <u>Android</u> <u>with</u> <u>NVIDIA</u> <u>Nsight</u> <u>Tegra</u> <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Edition</u>, this property  specifies
       whether to build an executable as an application package on Android.

       When this property is set to true the executable when built for Android will be created as an application
       package.  This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_ANDROID_GUI</u> variable if it is set when a
       target is created.

       Add  the  <b>AndroidManifest.xml</b> source file explicitly to the target <u>add_executable()</u> command invocation to
       specify the root directory of the application package source.

   <b>ANDROID_JAR_DEPENDENCIES</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Set the Android property that specifies JAR dependencies.  This is a string value property. This property
       is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_ANDROID_JAR_DEPENDENCIES</u> variable if it is set when a target  is
       created.

   <b>ANDROID_JAR_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Set the Android property that specifies directories to search for the JAR libraries.

       This  a  string  property  that  contains  the  directory paths separated by semicolons. This property is
       initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_ANDROID_JAR_DIRECTORIES</u> variable if it is  set  when  a  target  is
       created.

       Contents  of  <b>ANDROID_JAR_DIRECTORIES</b>  may  use  "generator expressions" with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.

   <b>ANDROID_JAVA_SOURCE_DIR</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Set the Android property that defines the Java source code root directories.  This a string property that
       contains the directory paths separated by semicolon.  This property is initialized by the  value  of  the
       <u>CMAKE_ANDROID_JAVA_SOURCE_DIR</u> variable if it is set when a target is created.

   <b>ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Set the Android property that specifies the .so dependencies.  This is a string property.

       This  property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES</u> variable if it is
       set when a target is created.

       Contents of <b>ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES</b> may use "generator expressions" with the syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See
       the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.

   <b>ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Set the Android property that specifies directories to search for the <b>.so</b> libraries.

       This a string property that contains the directory paths separated by semicolons.

       set when a target is created.

       Contents of <b>ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DIRECTORIES</b> may use "generator expressions" with the syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See
       the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.

   <b>ANDROID_PROCESS_MAX</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Set  the  Android  property  that defines the maximum number of a parallel Android NDK compiler processes
       (e.g. <b>4</b>).  This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_ANDROID_PROCESS_MAX</u> variable if  it  is
       set when a target is created.

   <b>ANDROID_PROGUARD</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       When  this  property is set to true that enables the ProGuard tool to shrink, optimize, and obfuscate the
       code by removing unused code and renaming classes, fields, and methods with semantically  obscure  names.
       This  property  is  initialized  by  the value of the <u>CMAKE_ANDROID_PROGUARD</u> variable if it is set when a
       target is created.

   <b>ANDROID_PROGUARD_CONFIG_PATH</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Set the Android property that specifies the location of the ProGuard config file. Leave empty to use  the
       default  one.   This  a string property that contains the path to ProGuard config file.  This property is
       initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_ANDROID_PROGUARD_CONFIG_PATH</u> variable if it is set when a target is
       created.

   <b>ANDROID_SECURE_PROPS_PATH</b>

       Set the Android property that states the location of the  secure  properties  file.   This  is  a  string
       property   that   contains   the   file  path.   This  property  is  initialized  by  the  value  of  the
       <u>CMAKE_ANDROID_SECURE_PROPS_PATH</u> variable if it is set when a target is created.

   <b>ANDROID_SKIP_ANT_STEP</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Set the Android property that defines whether or not to skip the Ant  build  step.   This  is  a  boolean
       property  initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_ANDROID_SKIP_ANT_STEP</u> variable if it is set when a target
       is created.

   <b>ANDROID_STL_TYPE</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       When <u>Cross</u> <u>Compiling</u> <u>for</u> <u>Android</u> <u>with</u> <u>NVIDIA</u> <u>Nsight</u> <u>Tegra</u> <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Edition</u>, this property  specifies
       the  type  of  STL  support  for the project.  This is a string property that could set to the one of the
       following values:

       <b>none</b>   No C++ Support

       <b>system</b> Minimal C++ without STL

       <b>gabi++_static</b>
              GAbi++ Static

       <b>gabi++_shared</b>
              GAbi++ Shared

       <b>gnustl_static</b>
              GNU libstdc++ Static

       <b>gnustl_shared</b>
              GNU libstdc++ Shared

       <b>stlport_static</b>
              STLport Static

       <b>stlport_shared</b>
              STLport Shared

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_ANDROID_STL_TYPE</u> variable if  it  is  set  when  a
       target is created.

   <b>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</b>
       Output directory in which to build <u>ARCHIVE</u> target files.

       This  property  specifies  the  directory  into which archive target files should be built.  The property
       value may use  <u>generator</u>  <u>expressions</u>.   Multi-configuration  generators  (<u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>,  <u>Xcode</u>,  <u>Ninja</u>
       <u>Multi-Config</u>)  append  a  per-configuration  subdirectory  to  the specified directory unless a generator
       expression is used.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u> variable  if  it  is  set
       when a target is created.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          On  macOS,  this  property  will  be  ignored  for  the  linker  import  files  (e.g.  <b>.tbd</b> files, see
          <u>ENABLE_EXPORTS</u> property for details) when:

          • The <u>FRAMEWORK</u> is set, because the framework layout cannot be changed.

          • The <u>Xcode</u> generator is used, due to the limitations and constraints of the <b>Xcode</b> tool.

          In both cases, the linker import files will be generated in the same directory as the shared library.

       See also the <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> target property.

   <b>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration output directory for <u>ARCHIVE</u> target files.

       This  is  a  per-configuration   version   of   the   <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u>   target   property,   but
       multi-configuration  generators  (VS,  Xcode)  do  NOT  append  a  per-configuration  subdirectory to the
       specified    directory.     This    property    is    initialized     by     the     value     of     the
       <u>CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> variable if it is set when a target is created.

       Contents of <b>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

   <b>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME</b>
       Output name for <u>ARCHIVE</u> target files.

       This  property  specifies  the  base  name  for  archive  target  files.   It  overrides  <u>OUTPUT_NAME</u> and
       <u>OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> properties.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          On macOS, this property  will  be  ignored  for  the  linker  import  files  (e.g.   <b>.tbd</b>  files,  see
          <u>ENABLE_EXPORTS</u> property for details) when:

          • The <u>FRAMEWORK</u> is set, because the framework layout cannot be changed.

          • The <u>Xcode</u> generator is used, due to the limitations and constraints of the <b>Xcode</b> tool.

          In both cases, the linker import files will be generated with the same name as the shared library.

       See also the <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> target property.

   <b>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration output name for <u>ARCHIVE</u> target files.

       This is the configuration-specific version of the <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME</u> target property.

   <b>AUTOGEN_BETTER_GRAPH_MULTI_CONFIG</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       <b>AUTOGEN_BETTER_GRAPH_MULTI_CONFIG</b>  is  a  boolean  property  that  can  be set on a target to have better
       dependency graph for multi-configuration generators.  When this property is enabled, <b>CMake</b> will  generate
       more  per-config  targets.   Thus,  the  dependency  graph  will be more accurate for multi-configuration
       generators and some recompilations will be avoided.

       If the Qt version is 6.8 or newer, this property is enabled by default.  If the Qt version is older  than
       6.8,  this property is disabled by default.  Consult the Qt documentation to check if the property can be
       enabled for older Qt versions.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

       This property is initialized by the <u>CMAKE_AUTOGEN_BETTER_GRAPH_MULTI_CONFIG</u> variable if it is set when  a
       target is created.

   <b>AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Directory where <u>AUTOMOC</u>, <u>AUTOUIC</u> and <u>AUTORCC</u> generate files for the target.

       The directory is created on demand and automatically added to the <u>ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES</u> target property.

       When   unset   or   empty   the   directory   <b>&lt;dir&gt;/&lt;target-name&gt;_autogen</b>   is   used   where   <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>  is
       <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u> and <b>&lt;target-name&gt;</b> is <u>NAME</u>.

       By default <b>AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR</b> is unset.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>AUTOGEN_COMMAND_LINE_LENGTH_MAX</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       Command line length limit for autogen targets, i.e. <b>moc</b> or <b>uic</b>, that triggers the use of  response  files
       on Windows instead of passing all arguments to the command line.

       • An empty (or unset) value sets the limit to 32000

       • A positive non zero integer value sets the exact command line length limit.

       By default <b>AUTOGEN_COMMAND_LINE_LENGTH_MAX</b> is initialized from <u>CMAKE_AUTOGEN_COMMAND_LINE_LENGTH_MAX</u>.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       Switch for forwarding origin target dependencies to the corresponding <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u> target.

          <b>NOTE:</b>
              If  Qt  5.15  or  later  is  used and the generator is either <u>Ninja</u> or <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u>, origin
              target dependencies are forwarded to the <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen_timestamp_deps</u> <u>target</u> target instead
              of <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u>

       Targets which have their <u>AUTOMOC</u> or <u>AUTOUIC</u> property <b>ON</b> have a corresponding <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u>  <u>target</u>
       target  which  generates  <b>moc</b>  and  <b>uic</b>  files.  As this <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u> target is created at
       generate-time, it is not possible to define dependencies of it using e.g.   <u>add_dependencies()</u>.   Instead
       the  <b>AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS</b>  target  property  decides  whether  the origin target dependencies should be
       forwarded to the <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u> target or not.

       By default <b>AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS</b>  is  initialized  from  <u>CMAKE_AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS</u>  which  is  <b>ON</b>  by
       default.

       In total the dependencies of the <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u> target are composed from

       • forwarded origin target dependencies (enabled by default via <b>AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS</b>)

       • additional user defined dependencies from <u>AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS</u>

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Disabling  <b>AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS</b>  is  useful  to  avoid  building  of origin target dependencies when
          building the <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u> target only. This is especially  interesting  when  a  <u>global</u>
          <u>autogen</u> <u>target</u> is enabled.

          When  the <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u> target doesn't require all the origin target's dependencies, and
          <b>AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS</b> is disabled, it might be necessary  to  extend  <u>AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS</u>  to  add
          missing dependencies.

   <b>AUTOGEN_PARALLEL</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       Number of parallel <b>moc</b> or <b>uic</b> processes to start when using <u>AUTOMOC</u> and <u>AUTOUIC</u>.

       The  custom  <u>The</u>  <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u>  <u>target</u>  target  starts a number of threads of which each one parses a
       source file and on demand starts a <b>moc</b> or  <b>uic</b>  process.  <b>AUTOGEN_PARALLEL</b>  controls  how  many  parallel
       threads (and therefore <b>moc</b> or <b>uic</b> processes) are started.

       • An  empty  (or  unset)  value  or the string <b>AUTO</b> sets the number of threads/processes to the number of
         physical CPUs on the host system.

       • A positive non zero integer value sets the exact thread/process count.

       • Otherwise a single thread/process is started.

       By default <b>AUTOGEN_PARALLEL</b> is initialized from <u>CMAKE_AUTOGEN_PARALLEL</u>.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS</b>
       Additional target dependencies of the corresponding <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u> target.

          <b>NOTE:</b>
              If Qt 5.15 or later is used and the generator is either <u>Ninja</u> or <u>Makefile</u>  <u>Generators</u>,  additional
              target  dependencies are added to the <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen_timestamp_deps</u> <u>target</u> target instead of
              the <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u> target.

       Targets which have their <u>AUTOMOC</u> or <u>AUTOUIC</u> property <b>ON</b> have a corresponding <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u>  <u>target</u>
       target  which  generates  <b>moc</b>  and  <b>uic</b> files.  As this <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u>  target is created at
       generate-time, it is not possible to define dependencies of it using e.g.   <u>add_dependencies()</u>.   Instead
       the  <b>AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS</b> target property can be set to a <u>;-list</u> of additional dependencies for the <u>The</u>
       <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u>  target. Dependencies can be target names or file names.

       In total the dependencies of the <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u>  target are composed from

       • forwarded origin target dependencies (enabled by default via <u>AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS</u>)

       • additional user defined dependencies from <b>AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS</b>

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>Use</b> <b>cases</b>
       If <u>AUTOMOC</u> or <u>AUTOUIC</u> depends on a file that is either

       • a <u>GENERATED</u> non C++ file (e.g. a <u>GENERATED</u> <b>.json</b> or <b>.ui</b> file) or

       • a <u>GENERATED</u> C++ file that isn't recognized by <u>AUTOMOC</u> and <u>AUTOUIC</u> because it's skipped by <u>SKIP_AUTOMOC</u>,
         <u>SKIP_AUTOUIC</u>, <u>SKIP_AUTOGEN</u> or <u>CMP0071</u> or

       • a file that isn't in the origin target's sources

       it must be added to <b>AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS</b>.

   <b>AUTOGEN_USE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       <b>AUTOGEN_USE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE</b> is a boolean property that can be set on a target to indicate that the autogen
       target include directory should be added as a system include directory or normal include directory to the
       target.

       If this property is not set, the autogen target include directory is added as a system include  directory
       by default.  See policy <u>CMP0151</u>.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

       This  property is initialized by the <u>CMAKE_AUTOGEN_USE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE</u> variable if it is set when a target
       is created.

   <b>AUTOMOC</b>
       Should the target be processed with auto-moc (for Qt projects).

       <b>AUTOMOC</b> is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle the Qt  <b>moc</b>  preprocessor  automatically,  i.e.
       without  having  to use commands like <u>QT4_WRAP_CPP()</u>, <u>qt5_wrap_cpp()</u>, etc.  Currently, Qt versions 4 to 6
       are supported.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_AUTOMOC</u> variable if it is set  when  a  target  is
       created.

       When  this  property  is set <b>ON</b>, CMake will scan the header and source files at build time and invoke <b>moc</b>
       accordingly.

   <b>Header</b> <b>file</b> <b>processing</b>
       At configuration time, a list of header files that should be scanned by  <b>AUTOMOC</b>  is  computed  from  the
       target's sources.

       • All header files in the target's sources are added to the scan list.

       • For all C++ source files <b>&lt;source_base&gt;.&lt;source_extension&gt;</b> in the target's sources, CMake searches for

         • a regular header with the same base name (<b>&lt;source_base&gt;.&lt;header_extention&gt;</b>) and

         • a private header with the same base name and a <b>_p</b> suffix (<b>&lt;source_base&gt;_p.&lt;header_extention&gt;</b>)

         and adds these to the scan list.

       At build time, CMake scans each unknown or modified header file from the list and searches for

       • a Qt macro from <u>AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES</u>,

       • additional file dependencies from the <b>FILE</b> argument of a <b>Q_PLUGIN_METADATA</b> macro and

       • additional file dependencies detected by filters defined in <u>AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS</u>.

       If   a  Qt  macro  is  found,  then  the  header  will  be  compiled  by  the  <b>moc</b>  to  the  output  file
       <b>moc_&lt;base_name&gt;.cpp</b>.  The complete output file path is described in the section <u>Output</u> <u>file</u> <u>location</u>.

       The header will be <b>moc</b> compiled again if a file from the additional file dependencies changes.

       Header <b>moc</b> output files <b>moc_&lt;base_name&gt;.cpp</b> can be included in source files.  In  the  section  <u>Including</u>
       <u>header</u> <u>moc</u> <u>files</u> <u>in</u> <u>sources</u> there is more information on that topic.

   <b>Source</b> <b>file</b> <b>processing</b>
       At build time, CMake scans each unknown or modified C++ source file from the target's sources for

       • a Qt macro from <u>AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES</u>,

       • includes of header <b>moc</b> files (see <u>Including</u> <u>header</u> <u>moc</u> <u>files</u> <u>in</u> <u>sources</u>),

       • additional file dependencies from the <b>FILE</b> argument of a <b>Q_PLUGIN_METADATA</b> macro and

       • additional file dependencies detected by filters defined in <u>AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS</u>.

       If a Qt macro is found, then the C++ source file <b>&lt;base&gt;.&lt;source_extension&gt;</b> is expected to as well contain
       an include statement

          #include &lt;&lt;base&gt;.moc&gt; // or
          #include "&lt;base&gt;.moc"

       The  source  file  then  will be compiled by the <b>moc</b> to the output file <b>&lt;base&gt;.moc</b>.  A description of the
       complete output file path is in section <u>Output</u> <u>file</u> <u>location</u>.

       The source will be <b>moc</b> compiled again if a file from the additional file dependencies changes.

   <b>Including</b> <b>header</b> <b>moc</b> <b>files</b> <b>in</b> <b>sources</b>
       A source file can include the <b>moc</b> output file of a header <b>&lt;header_base&gt;.&lt;header_extension&gt;</b>  by  using  an
       include statement of the form

          #include &lt;moc_&lt;header_base&gt;.cpp&gt; // or
          #include "moc_&lt;header_base&gt;.cpp"

       If  the <b>moc</b> output file of a header is included by a source, it will be generated in a different location
       than if it was not included.  This is described in the section <u>Output</u> <u>file</u> <u>location</u>.

   <b>Output</b> <b>file</b> <b>location</b>
   <b>Included</b> <b>moc</b> <b>output</b> <b>files</b>
       <b>moc</b> output files that are included by a source file will be generated in

       • <b>&lt;AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR&gt;/include</b> for single configuration generators or in

       • <b>&lt;AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR&gt;/include_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> for <u>multi</u> <u>configuration</u> generators.

       Where <b>&lt;AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR&gt;</b> is the value of the target property <u>AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR</u>.

       The include directory is automatically added to the target's <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>.

   <b>Not</b> <b>included</b> <b>moc</b> <b>output</b> <b>files</b>
       <b>moc</b> output files that are not included in a source file will be generated in

       • <b>&lt;AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR&gt;/&lt;SOURCE_DIR_CHECKSUM&gt;</b> for single configuration generators or in,

       • <b>&lt;AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR&gt;/include_&lt;CONFIG&gt;/&lt;SOURCE_DIR_CHECKSUM&gt;</b> for <u>multi</u> <u>configuration</u> generators.

       Where <b>&lt;SOURCE_DIR_CHECKSUM&gt;</b> is a checksum computed from the relative parent directory  path  of  the  <b>moc</b>
       input file.  This scheme allows to have <b>moc</b> input files with the same name in different directories.

       All not included <b>moc</b> output files will be included automatically by the CMake generated file

       • <b>&lt;AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR&gt;/mocs_compilation.cpp</b>, or

       • <b>&lt;AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR&gt;/mocs_compilation_$&lt;CONFIG&gt;.cpp</b>,

       which is added to the target's sources.

   <b>Qt</b> <b>version</b> <b>detection</b>
       <b>AUTOMOC</b>  enabled  targets  need  to  know the Qt major and minor version they're working with.  The major
       version usually is provided by the <b>INTERFACE_QT_MAJOR_VERSION</b> property of the <b>Qt[456]Core</b>  library,  that
       the target links to.  To find the minor version, CMake builds a list of available Qt versions from

       • <b>Qt6Core_VERSION_MAJOR</b> and <b>Qt6Core_VERSION_MINOR</b> variables (usually set by <b>find_package(Qt6...)</b>)

       • <b>Qt6Core_VERSION_MAJOR</b> and <b>Qt6Core_VERSION_MINOR</b> directory properties

       • <b>Qt5Core_VERSION_MAJOR</b> and <b>Qt5Core_VERSION_MINOR</b> variables (usually set by <b>find_package(Qt5...)</b>)

       • <b>Qt5Core_VERSION_MAJOR</b> and <b>Qt5Core_VERSION_MINOR</b> directory properties

       • <b>QT_VERSION_MAJOR</b> and <b>QT_VERSION_MINOR</b>  variables (usually set by <b>find_package(Qt4...)</b>)

       • <b>QT_VERSION_MAJOR</b> and <b>QT_VERSION_MINOR</b>  directory properties

       in the context of the <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u> call.

       Assumed   <b>INTERFACE_QT_MAJOR_VERSION</b> is a valid number, the first entry in the list with a matching major
       version  is  taken.   If  no  matching  major  version  was   found,   an   error   is   generated.    If
       <b>INTERFACE_QT_MAJOR_VERSION</b> is not a valid number, the first entry in the list is taken.

       A  <b>find_package(Qt[456]...)</b> call sets the <b>QT/Qt[56]Core_VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR</b> variables.  If the call is in
       a different context than the <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u> call, e.g. in a function, then the version
       variables might not be available to the <b>AUTOMOC</b> enabled target.  In that case the version  variables  can
       be  forwarded  from the <b>find_package(Qt[456]...)</b> calling context to the <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u>
       calling context as directory properties.  The following Qt5 example demonstrates the procedure.

          function (add_qt5_client)
            find_package(Qt5 REQUIRED QUIET COMPONENTS Core Widgets)
            ...
            set_property(DIRECTORY "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}"
              PROPERTY Qt5Core_VERSION_MAJOR "${Qt5Core_VERSION_MAJOR}")
            set_property(DIRECTORY "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}"
              PROPERTY Qt5Core_VERSION_MINOR "${Qt5Core_VERSION_MAJOR}")
            ...
          endfunction ()
          ...
          add_qt5_client()
          add_executable(myTarget main.cpp)
          target_link_libraries(myTarget Qt5::QtWidgets)
          set_property(TARGET myTarget PROPERTY AUTOMOC ON)

   <b>Modifiers</b>
       <u>AUTOMOC_EXECUTABLE</u>: The <b>moc</b> executable will be detected automatically, but can be  forced  to  a  certain
       binary using this target property.

       <u>AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS</u>: Additional command line options for <b>moc</b> can be set in this target property.

       <u>AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES</u>:  This  list  of  Qt  macro  names can be extended to search for additional macros in
       headers and sources.

       <u>AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS</u>: <b>moc</b> dependency file names can be extracted from headers or  sources  by  defining
       file name filters in this target property.

       <u>AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES</u>: Compiler pre definitions for <b>moc</b> are written to the <b>moc_predefs.h</b> file.  The
       generation of this file can be enabled or disabled in this target property.

       <u>SKIP_AUTOMOC</u>:  Sources  and  headers  can be excluded from <b>AUTOMOC</b> processing by setting this source file
       property.

       <u>SKIP_AUTOGEN</u>: Source files can be excluded from <b>AUTOMOC</b>, <u>AUTOUIC</u> and <u>AUTORCC</u> processing by  setting  this
       source file property.

       <u>AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP</u>:  This  global  property  can be used to group files generated by <b>AUTOMOC</b> or <u>AUTORCC</u>
       together in an IDE, e.g.  in MSVS.

       <u>AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER</u>: This global property can be used to group <b>AUTOMOC</b>, <u>AUTOUIC</u>  and  <u>AUTORCC</u>  targets
       together in an IDE, e.g.  in MSVS.

       <u>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET</u>:  A  global  <b>autogen</b> target, that depends on all <b>AUTOMOC</b> or <u>AUTOUIC</u> generated
       <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u> targets in the project, will be generated when this variable is <b>ON</b>.

       <u>AUTOGEN_PARALLEL</u>: This target property controls the number of <b>moc</b> or <b>uic</b> processes to start  in  parallel
       during builds.

       <u>AUTOGEN_COMMAND_LINE_LENGTH_MAX</u>:  This  target property controls the limit when to use response files for
       <b>moc</b> or <b>uic</b> processes on Windows.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       Boolean value used by <u>AUTOMOC</u> to determine if the compiler pre definitions file <b>moc_predefs.h</b>  should  be
       generated.

       CMake generates a <b>moc_predefs.h</b> file with compiler pre definitions from the output of the command defined
       in <u>CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_PREDEFINES_COMMAND</u> when

       • <u>AUTOMOC</u> is enabled,

       • <b>AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES</b> is enabled,

       • <u>CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_PREDEFINES_COMMAND</u> isn't empty and

       • the Qt version is greater or equal 5.8.

       The  <b>moc_predefs.h</b> file, which is generated in <u>AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR</u>, is passed to <b>moc</b> as the argument to the
       <b>--include</b> option.

       By default <b>AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES</b> is initialized from <u>CMAKE_AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES</u>, which is ON
       by default.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Filter definitions used by <u>AUTOMOC</u> to extract file names from  a  source  file  that  are  registered  as
       additional dependencies for the <b>moc</b> file of the source file.

       Filters  are defined as <b>KEYWORD;REGULAR_EXPRESSION</b> pairs. First the file content is searched for <b>KEYWORD</b>.
       If  it  is  found  at  least  once,  then  file  names  are  extracted  by  successively  searching   for
       <b>REGULAR_EXPRESSION</b> and taking the first match group.

       The file name found in the first match group is searched for

       • first in the vicinity of the source file

       • and afterwards in the target's <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>.

       If  any  of the extracted files changes, then the <b>moc</b> file for the source file gets rebuilt even when the
       source file itself doesn't change.

       If any of the extracted files is <u>GENERATED</u> or if it is not in the target's  sources,  then  it  might  be
       necessary  to add it to the <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u> target  dependencies.  See <u>AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS</u>
       for reference.

       By default <b>AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS</b> is initialized from <u>CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS</u>,  which  is  empty  by
       default.

       From Qt 5.15.0 on this variable is ignored as <b>moc</b> is able to output the correct dependencies.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>Example</b> <b>1</b>
       A  header  file  <b>my_class.hpp</b>  uses  a  custom  macro <b>JSON_FILE_MACRO</b> which is defined in an other header
       <b>macros.hpp</b>.  We want the <b>moc</b> file of <b>my_class.hpp</b> to depend on the file name argument of <b>JSON_FILE_MACRO</b>:

          // my_class.hpp
          class My_Class : public QObject
          {
            Q_OBJECT
            JSON_FILE_MACRO ( "info.json" )
          ...
          };

       In <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> we add a filter to <u>CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS</u> like this:

          list( APPEND CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS
            "JSON_FILE_MACRO"
            "[\n][ \t]*JSON_FILE_MACRO[ \t]*\\([ \t]*\"([^\"]+)\""
          )

       We assume <b>info.json</b> is a plain (not <u>GENERATED</u>) file that is listed in the target's source.  Therefore  we
       do not need to add it to <u>AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS</u>.

   <b>Example</b> <b>2</b>
       In  the  target  <b>my_target</b>  a header file <b>complex_class.hpp</b> uses a custom macro <b>JSON_BASED_CLASS</b> which is
       defined in an other header <b>macros.hpp</b>:

          // macros.hpp
          ...
          #define JSON_BASED_CLASS(name, json) \
          class name : public QObject \
          { \
            Q_OBJECT \
            Q_PLUGIN_METADATA(IID "demo" FILE json) \
            name() {} \
          };
          ...

          // complex_class.hpp
          #pragma once
          JSON_BASED_CLASS(Complex_Class, "meta.json")
          // end of file

       Since <b>complex_class.hpp</b> doesn't contain a <b>Q_OBJECT</b> macro it would be ignored by <u>AUTOMOC</u>.  We change  this
       by adding <b>JSON_BASED_CLASS</b> to <u>CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES</u>:

          list(APPEND CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES "JSON_BASED_CLASS")

       We   want  the  <b>moc</b>  file  of  <b>complex_class.hpp</b>  to  depend  on  <b>meta.json</b>.   So  we  add  a  filter  to
       <u>CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS</u>:

          list(APPEND CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS
            "JSON_BASED_CLASS"
            "[\n^][ \t]*JSON_BASED_CLASS[ \t]*\\([^,]*,[ \t]*\"([^\"]+)\""
          )

       Additionally we assume <b>meta.json</b> is <u>GENERATED</u> which is why we have to add it to <u>AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS</u>:

          set_property(TARGET my_target APPEND PROPERTY AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS "meta.json")

   <b>AUTOMOC_EXECUTABLE</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       <b>AUTOMOC_EXECUTABLE</b> is file path pointing to the <b>moc</b> executable to use for <u>AUTOMOC</u> enabled files.  Setting
       this  property will make CMake skip the automatic detection of the <b>moc</b> binary as well as the sanity-tests
       normally run to ensure that the binary is available and working as expected.

       Usually this property does not need to be set. Only consider this property if auto-detection of  <b>moc</b>  can
       not work -- e.g. because you are building the <b>moc</b> binary as part of your project.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       A  <u>semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  of  macro  names  used  by  <u>AUTOMOC</u>  to determine if a C++ file needs to be
       processed by <b>moc</b>.

       This property is only used if the <u>AUTOMOC</u> property is <b>ON</b> for this target.

       When running <u>AUTOMOC</u>, CMake searches for the strings listed in  <b>AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES</b>  in  C++  source  and
       header files.  If any of the strings is found

       • as the first non space string on a new line or

       • as the first non space string after a <b>{</b> on a new line,

       then the file will be processed by <b>moc</b>.

       By default <b>AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES</b> is initialized from <u>CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES</u>.

       See also the <u>INTERFACE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES</u> target property.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>Example</b>
       In  this  case  the <b>Q_OBJECT</b> macro is hidden inside another macro called <b>CUSTOM_MACRO</b>.  To let CMake know
       that source files that contain <b>CUSTOM_MACRO</b> need to be <b>moc</b> processed, we call:

          set_property(TARGET tgt APPEND PROPERTY AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES "CUSTOM_MACRO")

   <b>AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS</b>
       Additional options for <b>moc</b> when using <u>AUTOMOC</u>

       This property is only used if the <u>AUTOMOC</u> property is <b>ON</b>  for  this  target.   In  this  case,  it  holds
       additional  command  line  options  which will be used when <b>moc</b> is executed during the build, i.e.  it is
       equivalent to the optional <b>OPTIONS</b> argument of the <u>qt4_wrap_cpp()</u> macro.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS</u> variable if it is set  when  a
       target is created, or an empty string otherwise.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       In this example, the <b>moc</b> tool is invoked with the <b>-D_EXTRA_DEFINE</b> option when generating the moc file for
       <b>object.cpp</b>.

       <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>

                 add_executable(mocOptions object.cpp main.cpp)
                 set_property(TARGET mocOptions PROPERTY AUTOMOC ON)
                 target_compile_options(mocOptions PRIVATE "-D_EXTRA_DEFINE")
                 set_property(TARGET mocOptions PROPERTY AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS "-D_EXTRA_DEFINE")
                 target_link_libraries(mocOptions Qt6::Core)

       <b>object.hpp</b>

                 #ifndef Object_HPP
                 #define Object_HPP

                 #include &lt;QObject&gt;

                 #ifdef _EXTRA_DEFINE
                 class Object : public QObject
                 {
                 Q_OBJECT
                 public:

                   Object();

                 };
                 #endif

                 #endif

   <b>AUTOMOC_PATH_PREFIX</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       When  this  property  is  <b>ON</b>, CMake will generate the <b>-p</b> path prefix option for <b>moc</b> on <u>AUTOMOC</u> enabled Qt
       targets.

       To generate the path prefix, CMake tests if the header compiled by <b>moc</b> is in any of  the  target  <u>include</u>
       <u>directories</u>.   If  so,  CMake  will  compute  the relative path accordingly.  If the header is not in the
       <u>include</u> <u>directories</u>, CMake will omit the <b>-p</b> path prefix option.  <b>moc</b> usually generates a relative include
       path in that case.

       <b>AUTOMOC_PATH_PREFIX</b> is initialized from the variable <u>CMAKE_AUTOMOC_PATH_PREFIX</u>, which is <b>OFF</b> by default.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>Reproducible</b> <b>builds</b>
       For reproducible builds it is recommended to keep headers that are <b>moc</b> compiled  in  one  of  the  target
       <u>include</u> <u>directories</u> and set <b>AUTOMOC_PATH_PREFIX</b> to <b>ON</b>.  This ensures that:

       • <b>moc</b> output files are identical on different build setups,

       • <b>moc</b> output files will compile correctly when the source and/or build directory is a symbolic link.

   <b>AUTORCC</b>
       Should the target be processed with auto-rcc (for Qt projects).

       <b>AUTORCC</b>  is  a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle the Qt <b>rcc</b> code generator automatically, i.e.
       without having to  use  commands  like  <u>QT4_ADD_RESOURCES()</u>,  <u>qt5_add_resources()</u>,  etc.   Currently,  Qt
       versions 4 to 6 are supported.

       When  this  property is <b>ON</b>, CMake will handle <b>.qrc</b> files added as target sources at build time and invoke
       <b>rcc</b> accordingly.  This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_AUTORCC</u> variable if  it  is  set
       when a target is created.

       By  default  <b>AUTORCC</b> is processed by a <u>custom</u> <u>command</u>.  If the <b>.qrc</b> file is <u>GENERATED</u>, a <u>custom</u> <u>target</u> is
       used instead.

       When there are multiple <b>.qrc</b> files with the same name, CMake will generate unspecified unique output file
       names for <b>rcc</b>.  Therefore, if <b>Q_INIT_RESOURCE()</b> or <b>Q_CLEANUP_RESOURCE()</b> need to be used,  the  <b>.qrc</b>  file
       name must be unique.

   <b>Modifiers</b>
       <u>AUTORCC_EXECUTABLE</u>:  The  <b>rcc</b>  executable  will be detected automatically, but can be forced to a certain
       binary by setting this target property.

       <u>AUTORCC_OPTIONS</u>: Additional command line options for <b>rcc</b> can  be  set  via  this  target  property.   The
       corresponding <u>AUTORCC_OPTIONS</u> source file property can be used to specify options to be applied only to a
       specific <b>.qrc</b> file.

       <u>SKIP_AUTORCC</u>: <b>.qrc</b> files can be excluded from <b>AUTORCC</b> processing by setting this source file property.

       <u>SKIP_AUTOGEN</u>:  Source  files can be excluded from <u>AUTOMOC</u>, <u>AUTOUIC</u> and <b>AUTORCC</b> processing by setting this
       source file property.

       <u>AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP</u>: This global property can be used to group files generated  by  <u>AUTOMOC</u>  or  <b>AUTORCC</b>
       together in an IDE, e.g.  in MSVS.

       <u>AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER</u>:  This  global  property can be used to group <u>AUTOMOC</u>, <u>AUTOUIC</u> and <b>AUTORCC</b> targets
       together in an IDE, e.g.  in MSVS.

       <u>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTORCC_TARGET</u>: A global <b>autorcc</b> target that depends on all <b>AUTORCC</b> targets in  the  project
       will be generated when this variable is <b>ON</b>.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>AUTORCC_EXECUTABLE</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       <b>AUTORCC_EXECUTABLE</b>  is file path pointing to the <b>rcc</b> executable to use for <u>AUTORCC</u> enabled files. Setting
       this property will make CMake skip the automatic detection of the <b>rcc</b> binary as well as the  sanity-tests
       normally run to ensure that the binary is available and working as expected.

       Usually  this  property does not need to be set. Only consider this property if auto-detection of <b>rcc</b> can
       not work -- e.g. because you are building the <b>rcc</b> binary as part of your project.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>AUTORCC_OPTIONS</b>
       Additional options for <b>rcc</b> when using <u>AUTORCC</u>

       This property holds additional command line options which will be used when <b>rcc</b> is  executed  during  the
       build  via  <u>AUTORCC</u>,  i.e.  it  is equivalent to the optional <b>OPTIONS</b> argument of the <u>qt4_add_resources()</u>
       macro.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_AUTORCC_OPTIONS</u> variable  if  it  is  set  when  a
       target is created, or an empty string otherwise.

       The options set on the target may be overridden by <u>AUTORCC_OPTIONS</u> set on the <b>.qrc</b> source file.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
          # ...
          set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY AUTORCC_OPTIONS "--compress;9")
          # ...

   <b>AUTOUIC</b>
       Should the target be processed with auto-uic (for Qt projects).

       <b>AUTOUIC</b>  is  a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle the Qt <b>uic</b> code generator automatically, i.e.
       without having to use commands like <u>QT4_WRAP_UI()</u>, <u>qt5_wrap_ui()</u>, etc.  Currently, Qt versions 4 to 6 are
       supported.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_AUTOUIC</u> variable if it is set  when  a  target  is
       created.

       When  this  property  is  <b>ON</b>,  CMake  will  scan the header and source files at build time and invoke <b>uic</b>
       accordingly.

   <b>Header</b> <b>and</b> <b>source</b> <b>file</b> <b>processing</b>
       At build time, CMake scans each header and source file from the target's sources for  include  statements
       of the form

          #include "ui_&lt;ui_base&gt;.h"

       Once such an include statement is found in a file, CMake searches for the <b>uic</b> input file <b>&lt;ui_base&gt;.ui</b>

       • in the vicinity of the file and

       • in the <u>AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS</u> of the target.

       If the <b>&lt;ui_base&gt;.ui</b> file was found, <b>uic</b> is called on it to generate <b>ui_&lt;ui_base&gt;.h</b> in the directory

       • <b>&lt;AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR&gt;/include</b> for single configuration generators or in

       • <b>&lt;AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR&gt;/include_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> for <u>multi</u> <u>configuration</u> generators.

       Where <b>&lt;AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR&gt;</b> is the value of the target property <u>AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR</u>.

       The include directory is automatically added to the target's <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>.

   <b>Modifiers</b>
       <u>AUTOUIC_EXECUTABLE</u>:  The  <b>uic</b>  executable  will be detected automatically, but can be forced to a certain
       binary using this target property.

       <u>AUTOUIC_OPTIONS</u>: Additional command line options for <b>uic</b> can  be  set  via  this  target  property.   The
       corresponding <u>AUTOUIC_OPTIONS</u> source file property can be used to specify options to be applied only to a
       specific <b>&lt;base_name&gt;.ui</b> file.

       <u>SKIP_AUTOUIC</u>: Source files can be excluded from <b>AUTOUIC</b> processing by setting this source file property.

       <u>SKIP_AUTOGEN</u>:  Source  files can be excluded from <u>AUTOMOC</u>, <b>AUTOUIC</b> and <u>AUTORCC</u> processing by setting this
       source file property.

       <u>AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER</u>: This global property can be used to group <u>AUTOMOC</u>, <b>AUTOUIC</b>  and  <u>AUTORCC</u>  targets
       together in an IDE, e.g.  in MSVS.

       <u>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET</u>:  A  global  <b>autogen</b> target, that depends on all <u>AUTOMOC</u> or <b>AUTOUIC</b> generated
       <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u> targets in the project, will be generated when this variable is <b>ON</b>.

       <u>AUTOGEN_PARALLEL</u>: This target property controls the number of <b>moc</b> or <b>uic</b> processes to start  in  parallel
       during builds.

       <u>AUTOGEN_COMMAND_LINE_LENGTH_MAX</u>:  This  target property controls the limit when to use response files for
       <b>moc</b> or <b>uic</b> processes on Windows.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>AUTOUIC_EXECUTABLE</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       <b>AUTOUIC_EXECUTABLE</b> is file path pointing to the <b>uic</b> executable to use for <u>AUTOUIC</u> enabled files.  Setting
       this  property will make CMake skip the automatic detection of the <b>uic</b> binary as well as the sanity-tests
       normally run to ensure that the binary is available and working as expected.

       Usually this property does not need to be set. Only consider this property if auto-detection of  <b>uic</b>  can
       not work -- e.g. because you are building the <b>uic</b> binary as part of your project.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>AUTOUIC_OPTIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.0.

       Additional options for <b>uic</b> when using <u>AUTOUIC</u>

       This  property  holds  additional command line options which will be used when <b>uic</b> is executed during the
       build via <u>AUTOUIC</u>, i.e. it is equivalent to the optional <b>OPTIONS</b> argument of the <u>qt4_wrap_ui()</u> macro.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS</u> variable  if  it  is  set  when  a
       target is created, or an empty string otherwise.

       The options set on the target may be overridden by <u>AUTOUIC_OPTIONS</u> set on the <b>.ui</b> source file.

       This    property    may    use    "generator    expressions"   with   the   syntax   <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.    See   the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
          # ...
          set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY AUTOUIC_OPTIONS "--no-protection")
          # ...

   <b>AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Search path list used by <u>AUTOUIC</u> to find included <b>.ui</b> files.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS</u> variable if it is set when  a
       target is created. Otherwise it is empty.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>BINARY_DIR</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       This  read-only  property  reports the value of the <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u> variable in the directory in
       which the target was defined.

   <b>BUILD_RPATH</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       A <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> specifying runtime path (<b>RPATH</b>) entries to add to binaries linked in the build
       tree (for platforms that support it).  By default, CMake sets the runtime path of binaries in  the  build
       tree  to  contain  search paths it knows are needed to find the shared libraries they link.  Projects may
       set <b>BUILD_RPATH</b> to specify additional search paths.

       The build-tree runtime path will <u>not</u> be used for binaries in the install tree.  It will be replaced  with
       the install-tree runtime path during the installation step.  See also the <u>INSTALL_RPATH</u> target property.

       This property is initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_BUILD_RPATH</u> if it is set when a target is
       created.

       This property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       Other settings that affect the build-tree runtime path include:

       • The  <u>CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH</u>  variable  completely  disables  runtime paths in both the build tree and install
         tree.

       • The <u>SKIP_BUILD_RPATH</u> target property disables setting any runtime path in the build tree.

       • The <u>BUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN</u> target property causes  the  automatically-generated  runtime  path  to  use
         entries relative to <b>$ORIGIN</b>.

       • The  <u>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH</u>  target  property  causes binaries in the build tree to be built with the
         install-tree runtime path.

   <b>BUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       Whether to use relative paths for the build <b>RPATH</b>.

       This property is initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_BUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN</u>.

       On platforms that support runtime paths (<b>RPATH</b>) with the <b>$ORIGIN</b> token, setting  this  property  to  <b>TRUE</b>
       enables  relative  paths  in  the  build  <b>RPATH</b> for executables and shared libraries that point to shared
       libraries in the same build tree.

       Normally the build <b>RPATH</b> of a binary contains absolute paths to the directory of each shared  library  it
       links  to.   The  <b>RPATH</b>  entries  for directories contained within the build tree can be made relative to
       enable relocatable builds and to help achieve reproducible builds by omitting the  build  directory  from
       the build environment.

       This  property  has  no  effect  on platforms that do not support the <b>$ORIGIN</b> token in <b>RPATH</b>, or when the
       <u>CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH</u> variable is set. The runtime path set through the <u>BUILD_RPATH</u> target  property  is  also
       unaffected by this property.

   <b>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       <b>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR</b>  is  a  boolean  specifying whether the macOS <b>install_name</b> of a target in the
       build tree uses the directory given by <u>INSTALL_NAME_DIR</u>.  This setting only applies to targets on macOS.

       This property is initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR</u> if it is  set
       when a target is created.

       If  this property is not set and policy <u>CMP0068</u> is not <b>NEW</b>, the value of <u>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH</u> is used
       in its place.

   <b>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH</b>
       <b>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH</b> is a boolean specifying whether to link the target in the build  tree  with  the
       <u>INSTALL_RPATH</u>.   This  takes  precedence  over  <u>SKIP_BUILD_RPATH</u> and avoids the need for relinking before
       installation.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH</u> variable  if  it  is  set
       when a target is created.

       If  policy  <u>CMP0068</u>  is not <b>NEW</b>, this property also controls use of <u>INSTALL_NAME_DIR</u> in the build tree on
       macOS.  Either way, the <u>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR</u> target property takes precedence.

   <b>BUNDLE</b>
       This target is a <b>CFBundle</b> on the macOS.

       If a module library target has this property set to true it will be built as a <b>CFBundle</b> when built on the
       mac.  It will have the directory structure required for a <b>CFBundle</b> and will be suitable to  be  used  for
       creating Browser Plugins or other application resources.

   <b>BUNDLE_EXTENSION</b>
       The file extension used to name a <u>BUNDLE</u>, a <u>FRAMEWORK</u>, or a <u>MACOSX_BUNDLE</u> target on the macOS and iOS.

       The default value is <b>bundle</b>, <b>framework</b>, or <b>app</b> for the respective target types.

   <b>C_EXTENSIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.

       This  property  specifies  whether compiler specific extensions should be used.  For some compilers, this
       results in adding a flag such as <b>-std=gnu11</b> instead of <b>-std=c11</b> to the compile line.  This property is <b>ON</b>
       by default. The basic C standard level is controlled by the <u>C_STANDARD</u> target property.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u> manual for information on compile features  and  a  list  of  supported
       compilers.

       This  property  is  initialized  by  the value of the <u>CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS</u> variable if set when a target is
       created and otherwise by the value of <u>CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT</u> (see <u>CMP0128</u>).

   <b>C_STANDARD</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       The C standard whose features are requested to build this target.

       This property specifies the C standard whose features are requested  to  build  this  target.   For  some
       compilers, this results in adding a flag such as <b>-std=gnu11</b> to the compile line.  For compilers that have
       no  notion  of  a  C  standard  level,  such as Microsoft Visual C++ before VS 16.7, this property has no
       effect.

       Supported values are:

       <b>90</b>     C89/C90

       <b>99</b>     C99

       <b>11</b>     C11

       <b>17</b>     Added in version 3.21.

              C17

       <b>23</b>     Added in version 3.21.

              C23

       If the value requested does not result in a compile flag being added for the compiler in use, a  previous
       standard flag will be added instead.  This means that using:

          set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY C_STANDARD 11)

       with  a  compiler  which does not support <b>-std=gnu11</b> or an equivalent flag will not result in an error or
       warning, but will instead add the <b>-std=gnu99</b> or <b>-std=gnu90</b> flag if supported.  This "decay" behavior  may
       be  controlled  with  the  <u>C_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>  target  property.   Additionally, the <u>C_EXTENSIONS</u> target
       property may be used to control whether compiler-specific extensions are enabled on a per-target basis.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u> manual for information on compile features  and  a  list  of  supported
       compilers.

       This  property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_C_STANDARD</u> variable if it is set when a target is
       created.

   <b>C_STANDARD_REQUIRED</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Boolean describing whether the value of <u>C_STANDARD</u> is a requirement.

       If this property is set to <b>ON</b>, then the  value  of  the  <u>C_STANDARD</u>  target  property  is  treated  as  a
       requirement.  If this property is <b>OFF</b> or unset, the <u>C_STANDARD</u> target property is treated as optional and
       may  "decay" to a previous standard if the requested is not available.  For compilers that have no notion
       of a C standard level, such as Microsoft Visual C++ before VS 16.7, this property has no effect.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u> manual for information on compile features  and  a  list  of  supported
       compilers.

       This  property  is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u> variable if it is set when a
       target is created.

   <b>COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       By setting this target property, the target is configured to build with <b>C++/CLI</b> support.

       The  Visual  Studio  generator  defines   the   <b>clr</b>   parameter   depending   on   the   value   of   the
       <b>COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME</b> target property:

       Not Set (default)
          Native C++.

       <b>""</b> (set but empty)
          Mixed unmanaged/managed C++ using .NET Framework.

       <b>netcore</b>
              Added in version 3.26.

              Mixed unmanaged/managed C++ using .NET Core.

              This required VS 2019's v142 toolset or higher.

       <b>pure</b>
          Managed C++.

       <b>safe</b>
          Managed C++.

       This property is only evaluated <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> for VS 2010 and above.

       To  be  able  to  build  managed C++ targets with VS 2017 and above the component <b>C++/CLI</b> <b>support</b> must be
       installed, which may not be done by default.

       See also <u>IMPORTED_COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME</u>

   <b>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL</b>
       Properties which must be compatible with their link interface

       The <b>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL</b> property may contain a list of properties for this  target  which  must  be
       consistent  when  evaluated  as  a  boolean  with  the  <b>INTERFACE</b>  variant  of the property in all linked
       dependees.  For example, if a property <b>FOO</b> appears in the list, then for each dependee, the <b>INTERFACE_FOO</b>
       property content in all of its dependencies must be consistent with each other, and with the <b>FOO</b> property
       in the depender.

       Consistency in this sense has the meaning that if the property is set, then it must have the same boolean
       value as all others, and if the property is not set, then it is ignored.

       Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this property must not intersect with the
       set specified in any of the other <u>Compatible</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>Properties</u>.

   <b>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX</b>
       Properties whose maximum value from the link interface will be used.

       The <b>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX</b> property may contain a list  of  properties  for  this  target  whose
       maximum value may be read at generate time when evaluated in the <b>INTERFACE</b> variant of the property in all
       linked  dependees.   For  example,  if  a  property  <b>FOO</b> appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
       <b>INTERFACE_FOO</b> property content in all of its dependencies will be compared with each other and  with  the
       <b>FOO</b>  property in the depender.  When reading the <b>FOO</b> property at generate time, the maximum value will be
       returned. If the property is not set, then it is ignored.

       Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this property must not intersect with the
       set specified in any of the other <u>Compatible</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>Properties</u>.

   <b>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN</b>
       Properties whose minimum value from the link interface will be used.

       The <b>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN</b> property may contain a list  of  properties  for  this  target  whose
       minimum value may be read at generate time when evaluated in the <b>INTERFACE</b> variant of the property of all
       linked  dependees.   For  example,  if  a  property  <b>FOO</b> appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
       <b>INTERFACE_FOO</b> property content in all of its dependencies will be compared with each other and  with  the
       <b>FOO</b>  property in the depender.  When reading the <b>FOO</b> property at generate time, the minimum value will be
       returned.  If the property is not set, then it is ignored.

       Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this property must not intersect with the
       set specified in any of the other <u>Compatible</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>Properties</u>.

   <b>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING</b>
       Properties which must be string-compatible with their link interface

       The <b>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING</b> property may contain a list of properties for this target which  must  be
       the  same  when evaluated as a string in the <b>INTERFACE</b> variant of the property all linked dependees.  For
       example, if a property <b>FOO</b> appears in the list,  then  for  each  dependee,  the  <b>INTERFACE_FOO</b>  property
       content  in  all  of  its  dependencies  must  be equal with each other, and with the <b>FOO</b> property in the
       depender.  If the property is not set, then it is ignored.

       Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this property must not intersect with the
       set specified in any of the other <u>Compatible</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>Properties</u>.

   <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b>
       Preprocessor definitions for compiling a target's sources.

       The <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b> property may be set to a semicolon-separated  list  of  preprocessor  definitions
       using  the  syntax  <b>VAR</b>  or  <b>VAR=value</b>.   Function-style  definitions  are  not  supported.   CMake  will
       automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may
       require escapes to specify some values).

       CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported by the native build tool.

       Added in version 3.26: Any leading <b>-D</b> on an item will be removed.

       Disclaimer: Most  native  build  tools  have  poor  support  for  escaping  certain  values.   CMake  has
       work-arounds  for many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does
       not seem to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape sequences to
       the value.  Your work-around may break in a future version of CMake that  has  improved  escape  support.
       Instead  consider  defining  the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.  Known
       limitations include:

          #          - broken almost everywhere
          ;          - broken in VS IDE 7.0 and Borland Makefiles
          ,          - broken in VS IDE
          %          - broken in some cases in NMake
          &amp; |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
          ^ &lt; &gt; \"   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

       CMake does not reject these values outright because they do work in some cases.  Use with caution.

       Contents of <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b> may  use  "generator  expressions"  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See  the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

       The   corresponding  <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>  property  may  be  set  to  specify  per-configuration
       definitions.  Generator expressions should be preferred instead of setting the alternative property.

   <b>COMPILE_FEATURES</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Compiler features enabled for this target.

       The  list  of  features  in  this   property   are   a   subset   of   the   features   listed   in   the
       <u>CMAKE_C_COMPILE_FEATURES</u>, <u>CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILE_FEATURES</u>, and <u>CMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_FEATURES</u> variables.

       Contents  of  <b>COMPILE_FEATURES</b>  may  use  "generator  expressions"  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See  the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual  for  available  expressions.   See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u>
       manual for information on compile features and a list of supported compilers.

   <b>COMPILE_FLAGS</b>
       Additional flags to use when compiling this target's sources.

       The  <b>COMPILE_FLAGS</b>  property sets additional compiler flags used to build sources within the target.  Use
       <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u> to pass additional preprocessor definitions.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property has been superseded by the <u>COMPILE_OPTIONS</u> property.  Alternatively, you  can  also  use
          the <u>target_compile_options()</u> command instead.

   <b>COMPILE_OPTIONS</b>
       List of options to pass to the compiler.

       This  property  holds  a  <u>semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  of options specified so far for its target.  Use the
       <u>target_compile_options()</u> command to append more options.  The options will be added after  flags  in  the
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u>   and   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>   variables,  but  before  those  propagated  from
       dependencies by the <u>INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS</u> property.

       This property adds compile options for all languages in a target.   Use  the  <u>COMPILE_LANGUAGE</u>  generator
       expression to specify per-language compile options.

       This  property  is initialized by the <u>COMPILE_OPTIONS</u> directory property when a target is created, and is
       used by the generators to set the options for the compiler.

       Contents  of  <b>COMPILE_OPTIONS</b>  may  use  "generator  expressions"  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See   the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>Option</b> <b>De-duplication</b>
       The final set of options used for a target is constructed by accumulating options from the current target
       and the usage requirements of its dependencies.  The set of options is de-duplicated to avoid repetition.

       Added  in  version  3.12:  While  beneficial for individual options, the de-duplication step can break up
       option groups.  For example, <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>-option</b> <b>B</b> becomes <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>B</b>.  One may specify a group of options
       using shell-like quoting along with a <b>SHELL:</b> prefix.  The <b>SHELL:</b> prefix is dropped, and the rest  of  the
       option  string is parsed using the <u>separate_arguments()</u> <b>UNIX_COMMAND</b> mode. For example, <b>"SHELL:-option</b> <b>A"</b>
       <b>"SHELL:-option</b> <b>B"</b> becomes <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>-option</b> <b>B</b>.

   <b>COMPILE_PDB_NAME</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Output name for the MS debug symbol <b>.pdb</b> file generated by the compiler while building source files.

       This property specifies the base  name  for  the  debug  symbols  file.   If  not  set,  the  default  is
       unspecified.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The  compiler-generated  program database files are specified by the <b>/Fd</b> compiler flag and are not the
          same as linker-generated program database files specified by the <b>/pdb</b> linker flag.  Use  the  <u>PDB_NAME</u>
          property to specify the latter.

   <b>COMPILE_PDB_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Per-configuration  output name for the MS debug symbol <b>.pdb</b> file generated by the compiler while building
       source files.

       This is the configuration-specific version of <u>COMPILE_PDB_NAME</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The compiler-generated program database files are specified by the <b>/Fd</b> compiler flag and are  not  the
          same  as  linker-generated  program  database  files  specified  by  the  <b>/pdb</b>  linker  flag.  Use the
          <u>PDB_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> property to specify the latter.

   <b>COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Output directory for the MS debug symbol <b>.pdb</b> file generated by the compiler while building source files.

       This property specifies the directory into which the MS debug symbols will be  placed  by  the  compiler.
       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u> variable if it is set
       when a target is created.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The  compiler-generated  program database files are specified by the <b>/Fd</b> compiler flag and are not the
          same as linker-generated  program  database  files  specified  by  the  <b>/pdb</b>  linker  flag.   Use  the
          <u>PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u> property to specify the latter.

   <b>COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Per-configuration  output  directory  for  the  MS debug symbol <b>.pdb</b> file generated by the compiler while
       building source files.

       This is a per-configuration version of <u>COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u>, but  multi-configuration  generators
       (Visual  Studio,  Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
       property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> variable if it is
       set when a target is created.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The compiler-generated program database files are specified by the <b>/Fd</b> compiler flag and are  not  the
          same  as  linker-generated  program  database  files  specified  by  the  <b>/pdb</b>  linker  flag.  Use the
          <u>PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> property to specify the latter.

   <b>COMPILE_WARNING_AS_ERROR</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       Specify whether to treat warnings on compile as errors.  If enabled, adds a flag  to  treat  warnings  on
       compile  as  errors.   If the <u>cmake</u> <u>--compile-no-warning-as-error</u> option is given on the <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u> command
       line, this property is ignored.

       This property is not implemented for all compilers.  It is silently ignored if there is no implementation
       for the compiler being used.  The currently implemented <u>compiler</u> <u>IDs</u> are:

       • <b>GNU</b>

       • <b>Clang</b>

       • <b>AppleClang</b>

       • <b>Fujitsu</b>

       • <b>FujitsuClang</b>

       • <b>IBMClang</b>

       • <b>Intel</b>

       • <b>IntelLLVM</b>

       • <b>LCC</b>

       • <b>MSVC</b>

       • <b>NVHPC</b>

       • <b>NVIDIA</b> (CUDA)

       • <b>QCC</b>

       • <b>SunPro</b>

       • <b>TI</b>

       • <b>VisualAge</b>

       • <b>XL</b>

       • <b>XLClang</b>

       This property is initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_COMPILE_WARNING_AS_ERROR</u>  if  it  is  set
       when a target is created.

   <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;_OUTPUT_NAME</b>
       Old per-configuration target file base name.  Use <u>OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> instead.

       This is a configuration-specific version of the <u>OUTPUT_NAME</u> target property.

   <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX</b>
       Postfix to append to the target file name for configuration <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>.

       When  building with configuration <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> the value of this property is appended to the target file name
       built on  disk.   For  non-executable  targets,  this  property  is  initialized  by  the  value  of  the
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX</u> variable if it is set when a target is created.  This property is ignored on macOS
       for Frameworks and App Bundles.

       For macOS see also the <u>FRAMEWORK_MULTI_CONFIG_POSTFIX_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> target property.

   <b>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</b>
       Added in version 3.3.

       Use  the  given emulator to run executables created when crosscompiling.  This command will be added as a
       prefix to <u>add_test()</u>, <u>add_custom_command()</u>, and <u>add_custom_target()</u>  commands  for  built  target  system
       executables.

       Added  in version 3.15: If this property contains a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u>, then the first value is the
       command and remaining values are its arguments.

       Added in version 3.29: Contents of <b>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u> variable if it is set when
       a target is created.

   <b>CUDA_ARCHITECTURES</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       List of architectures to generate device code for.

       An architecture can be suffixed by either <b>-real</b> or <b>-virtual</b>  to  specify  the  kind  of  architecture  to
       generate code for.  If no suffix is given then code is generated for both real and virtual architectures.

       A  non-empty false value (e.g. <b>OFF</b>) disables adding architectures.  This is intended to support packagers
       and rare cases where full control over the passed flags is required.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES</u> variable if it is  set  when  a
       target is created.

       The  <b>CUDA_ARCHITECTURES</b>  target  property  must  be set to a non-empty value on targets that compile CUDA
       sources, or it is an error.  See policy <u>CMP0104</u>.

       The <b>CUDA_ARCHITECTURES</b> may be set to one of the following special values:

       <b>all</b>    Added in version 3.23.

              Compile for all supported major and minor  real  architectures,  and  the  highest  major  virtual
              architecture.

       <b>all-major</b>
              Added in version 3.23.

              Compile for all supported major real architectures, and the highest major virtual architecture.

       <b>native</b> Added in version 3.24.

              Compile for the architecture(s) of the host's GPU(s).

   <b>Examples</b>
          set_target_properties(tgt PROPERTIES CUDA_ARCHITECTURES "35;50;72")

       Generates code for real and virtual architectures <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> and <b>72</b>.

          set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY CUDA_ARCHITECTURES 70-real 72-virtual)

       Generates code for real architecture <b>70</b> and virtual architecture <b>72</b>.

          set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY CUDA_ARCHITECTURES OFF)

       CMake will not pass any architecture flags to the compiler.

   <b>CUDA_CUBIN_COMPILATION</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       Compile CUDA sources to <b>.cubin</b> files instead of <b>.obj</b> files within <u>Object</u> <u>Libraries</u>.

       For example:

          add_library(mycubin OBJECT a.cu b.cu)
          set_property(TARGET mycubin PROPERTY CUDA_CUBIN_COMPILATION ON)

   <b>CUDA_EXTENSIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.

       This  property  specifies  whether compiler specific extensions should be used.  For some compilers, this
       results in adding a flag such as <b>-std=gnu++11</b> instead of <b>-std=c++11</b> to the compile line.   This  property
       is <b>ON</b> by default. The basic CUDA/C++ standard level is controlled by the <u>CUDA_STANDARD</u> target property.

       See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  information on compile features and a list of supported
       compilers.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_CUDA_EXTENSIONS</u> variable if set when a  target  is
       created and otherwise by the value of <u>CMAKE_CUDA_EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT</u> (see <u>CMP0128</u>).

   <b>CUDA_FATBIN_COMPILATION</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       Compile CUDA sources to <b>.fatbin</b> files instead of <b>.obj</b> files within <u>Object</u> <u>Libraries</u>.

       For example:

          add_library(myfbins OBJECT a.cu b.cu)
          set_property(TARGET myfbins PROPERTY CUDA_FATBIN_COMPILATION ON)

   <b>CUDA_OPTIX_COMPILATION</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       Compile CUDA sources to <b>.optixir</b> files instead of <b>.obj</b> files within <u>Object</u> <u>Libraries</u>.

       For example:

          add_library(myoptix OBJECT a.cu b.cu)
          set_property(TARGET myoptix PROPERTY CUDA_OPTIX_COMPILATION ON)

   <b>CUDA_PTX_COMPILATION</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Compile CUDA sources to <b>.ptx</b> files instead of <b>.obj</b> files within <u>Object</u> <u>Libraries</u>.

       For example:

          add_library(myptx OBJECT a.cu b.cu)
          set_property(TARGET myptx PROPERTY CUDA_PTX_COMPILATION ON)

   <b>CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       CUDA only: Enables device linking for the specific library target where required.

       If  set,  this  will  tell  the required compilers to enable device linking on the library target. Device
       linking is an additional link step required by some CUDA  compilers  when  <u>CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION</u>  is
       enabled.  Normally device linking is deferred until a shared library or executable is generated, allowing
       for multiple static libraries to resolve device symbols at the same time when they are used by  a  shared
       library or executable.

       If  this property or <u>CMAKE_CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS</u> is unset, static libraries are treated as if it is
       disabled while shared, module, and executable targets behave as if it is on.

       If <u>CMAKE_CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS</u> has been defined, this property is  initialized  to  the  value  the
       variable and overriding the default behavior.

       Note that device linking is not supported for <u>Object</u> <u>Libraries</u>.

       For instance:

          set_property(TARGET mystaticlib PROPERTY CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS ON)

   <b>CUDA_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       Select the CUDA runtime library for use by compilers targeting the CUDA language.

       The allowed case insensitive values are:

       <b>None</b>   Link with <b>-cudart=none</b> or equivalent flag(s) to use no CUDA runtime library.

       <b>Shared</b> Link with <b>-cudart=shared</b> or equivalent flag(s) to use a dynamically-linked CUDA runtime library.

       <b>Static</b> Link with <b>-cudart=static</b> or equivalent flag(s) to use a statically-linked CUDA runtime library.

       Contents of <b>CUDA_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       If  that property is not set then CMake uses an appropriate default value based on the compiler to select
       the CUDA runtime library.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property has effect only when the <b>CUDA</b> language is enabled. To control the CUDA  runtime  linking
          when only using the CUDA SDK with the <b>C</b> or <b>C++</b> language we recommend using the <u>FindCUDAToolkit</u> module.

   <b>CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       CUDA only: Enables separate compilation of device code

       If set this will enable separable compilation for all CUDA files for the given target.

       For instance:

          set_property(TARGET myexe PROPERTY CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION ON)

       This  property  is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION</u> variable if it is set
       when a target is created.

   <b>CUDA_STANDARD</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       The CUDA/C++ standard whose features are requested to build this target.

       This property specifies the CUDA/C++ standard whose features are requested to  build  this  target.   For
       some compilers, this results in adding a flag such as <b>-std=gnu++11</b> to the compile line.

       Supported values are:

       <b>98</b>     CUDA C++98. Note that this maps to the same as <b>03</b> internally.

       <b>03</b>     CUDA C++03

       <b>11</b>     CUDA C++11

       <b>14</b>     CUDA  C++14.  While  CMake  3.8  and  later <u>recognize</u> <b>14</b> as a valid value, CMake 3.9 was the first
              version to include support for any compiler.

       <b>17</b>     CUDA C++17. While CMake 3.8 and later <u>recognize</u> <b>17</b> as a valid value,  CMake  3.18  was  the  first
              version to include support for any compiler.

       <b>20</b>     Added in version 3.12.

              CUDA  C++20.  While  CMake  3.12 and later <u>recognize</u> <b>20</b> as a valid value, CMake 3.18 was the first
              version to include support for any compiler.

       <b>23</b>     Added in version 3.20.

              CUDA C++23

       <b>26</b>     Added in version 3.25.

              CUDA C++26. CMake 3.25 and later <u>recognize</u> <b>26</b> as a valid value, no version  has  support  for  any
              compiler.

       If  the value requested does not result in a compile flag being added for the compiler in use, a previous
       standard flag will be added instead.  This means that using:

          set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY CUDA_STANDARD 11)

       with a compiler which does not support <b>-std=gnu++11</b> or an equivalent flag will not result in an error  or
       warning,  but  will  instead  add  the  <b>-std=gnu++03</b>  flag  if  supported.   This "decay" behavior may be
       controlled with the <u>CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u> target property.   Additionally,  the  <u>CUDA_EXTENSIONS</u>  target
       property may be used to control whether compiler-specific extensions are enabled on a per-target basis.

       See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  information on compile features and a list of supported
       compilers.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD</u> variable if it is set when a  target
       is created.

   <b>CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Boolean describing whether the value of <u>CUDA_STANDARD</u> is a requirement.

       If  this  property  is  set  to  <b>ON</b>,  then the value of the <u>CUDA_STANDARD</u> target property is treated as a
       requirement.  If this property is <b>OFF</b> or unset, the <u>CUDA_STANDARD</u> target property is treated as  optional
       and  may  "decay"  to  a previous standard if the requested is not available.  For compilers that have no
       notion of a standard level, such as MSVC 1800 (Visual Studio 2013) and lower, this has no effect.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u> manual for information on compile features  and  a  list  of  supported
       compilers.

       This  property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u> variable if it is set when
       a target is created.

   <b>CXX_EXTENSIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.

       This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be used.  For  some  compilers,  this
       results  in  adding a flag such as <b>-std=gnu++11</b> instead of <b>-std=c++11</b> to the compile line.  This property
       is <b>ON</b> by default. The basic C++ standard level is controlled by the <u>CXX_STANDARD</u> target property.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u> manual for information on compile features  and  a  list  of  supported
       compilers.

       This  property  is  initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS</u> variable if set when a target is
       created and otherwise by the value of <u>CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT</u> (see <u>CMP0128</u>).

   <b>CXX_MODULE_DIRS</b>
       Added in version 3.28.

       Semicolon-separated list of base directories of the target's default C++ module set (i.e.  the  file  set
       with name and type <b>CXX_MODULES</b>). The property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       This property is normally only set by <u>target_sources(FILE_SET)</u> rather than being manipulated directly.

       See <u>CXX_MODULE_DIRS_&lt;NAME&gt;</u> for the list of base directories in other C++ module sets.

   <b>CXX_MODULE_DIRS_&lt;NAME&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.28.

       Semicolon-separated  list  of  base  directories of the target's <b>&lt;NAME&gt;</b> C++ module set, which has the set
       type <b>CXX_MODULES</b>. The property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       This property is normally only set by <u>target_sources(FILE_SET)</u> rather than being manipulated directly.

       See <u>CXX_MODULE_DIRS</u> for the list of base directories in the default C++ module set.  See  <u>CXX_MODULE_SETS</u>
       for the file set names of all C++ module sets.

   <b>CXX_MODULE_SET</b>
       Added in version 3.28.

       Semicolon-separated  list  of  files in the target's default C++ module set, (i.e. the file set with name
       and type <b>CXX_MODULES</b>). If any of the paths are relative, they  are  computed  relative  to  the  target's
       source directory. The property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       This property is normally only set by <u>target_sources(FILE_SET)</u> rather than being manipulated directly.

       See <u>CXX_MODULE_SET_&lt;NAME&gt;</u> for the list of files in other C++ module sets.

   <b>CXX_MODULE_SET_&lt;NAME&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.28.

       Semicolon-separated  list  of  files  in  the  target's  <b>&lt;NAME&gt;</b>  C++  module  set, which has the set type
       <b>CXX_MODULES</b>. If any of the paths are  relative,  they  are  computed  relative  to  the  target's  source
       directory. The property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       This property is normally only set by <u>target_sources(FILE_SET)</u> rather than being manipulated directly.

       See  <u>CXX_MODULE_SET</u> for the list of files in the default C++ module set. See <u>CXX_MODULE_SETS</u> for the file
       set names of all C++ module sets.

   <b>CXX_MODULE_SETS</b>
       Added in version 3.28.

       Read-only list of the target's <b>PRIVATE</b> and <b>PUBLIC</b> C++ module sets (i.e.  all  file  sets  with  the  type
       <b>CXX_MODULES</b>).  Files  listed  in  these  file  sets  are  treated  as source files for the purpose of IDE
       integration.

       C++ module sets may be defined using the <u>target_sources()</u> command <b>FILE_SET</b> option with type <b>CXX_MODULES</b>.

       See also <u>CXX_MODULE_SET_&lt;NAME&gt;</u>, <u>CXX_MODULE_SET</u> and <u>INTERFACE_CXX_MODULE_SETS</u>.

   <b>CXX_MODULE_STD</b>
       Added in version 3.30.

       <b>CXX_MODULE_STD</b> is a boolean specifying whether the target may use <b>import</b> <b>std;</b> its C++ sources or not.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This setting is meaningful only when experimental support for <b>import</b> <b>std;</b>  has  been  enabled  by  the
          <b>CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX_IMPORT_STD</b> gate.

       When  this  property  is explicitly set to <b>ON</b>, CMake will add a dependency to a target which provides the
       C++ standard library's modules for the C++ standard applied to the target. This target is only applicable
       within the current build and will not appear in the exported interfaces of the targets.   When  consumed,
       these targets will be reapplied as necessary.

       This  property's  value  is  not  relevant for targets which disable scanning (see <u>CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES</u>).
       Additionally, this property only applies to targets utilizing C++23 (<b>cxx_std_23</b>) or newer.

       The property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>, however expressions that depend upon the configuration,  the
       consuming  target,  or  the  linker language are not allowed. Whether a target uses <b>import</b> <b>std</b> should not
       depend upon such things as it is a static property of the target's source code.

       Targets which are exported with C++ module sources will have this property's resolved value exported.

   <b>CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES</b>
       Added in version 3.28.

       <b>CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES</b> is a boolean specifying whether CMake will scan C++ sources in the target for module
       dependencies.  See also the <u>CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES</u> for per-source settings which,  if  set,  overrides  the
       target-wide settings.

       This  property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES</u> variable if it is set when a
       target is created.

       When this property is set <b>ON</b> or unset, CMake will scan the target's <b>CXX</b> sources at  build  time  and  add
       module  dependency  information  to  the compile line as necessary.  When this property is set <b>OFF</b>, CMake
       will not scan the target's <b>CXX</b> sources at build time.

       Note that scanning is only performed if C++20 or higher is enabled for the target.  Scanning for  modules
       in the target's sources belonging to file sets of type <b>CXX_MODULES</b> is always performed.

   <b>CXX_STANDARD</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       The C++ standard whose features are requested to build this target.

       This  property  specifies  the  C++ standard whose features are requested to build this target.  For some
       compilers, this results in adding a flag such as <b>-std=gnu++11</b> to the compile line.   For  compilers  that
       have  no  notion  of  a  standard  level,  such as Microsoft Visual C++ before 2015 Update 3, this has no
       effect.

       Supported values are:

       <b>98</b>     C++98

       <b>11</b>     C++11

       <b>14</b>     C++14

       <b>17</b>     Added in version 3.8.

              C++17

       <b>20</b>     Added in version 3.12.

              C++20

       <b>23</b>     Added in version 3.20.

              C++23

       <b>26</b>     Added in version 3.25.

              C++26. CMake 3.25 and later <u>recognize</u> <b>26</b> as  a  valid  value,  no  version  has  support  for  any
              compiler.

       If  the value requested does not result in a compile flag being added for the compiler in use, a previous
       standard flag will be added instead.  This means that using:

          set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 11)

       with a compiler which does not support <b>-std=gnu++11</b> or an equivalent flag will not result in an error  or
       warning,  but  will  instead  add  the  <b>-std=gnu++98</b>  flag  if  supported.   This "decay" behavior may be
       controlled with the <u>CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>  target  property.   Additionally,  the  <u>CXX_EXTENSIONS</u>  target
       property may be used to control whether compiler-specific extensions are enabled on a per-target basis.

       See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  information on compile features and a list of supported
       compilers.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD</u> variable if it is set when  a  target
       is created.

   <b>CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Boolean describing whether the value of <u>CXX_STANDARD</u> is a requirement.

       If  this  property  is  set  to  <b>ON</b>,  then  the value of the <u>CXX_STANDARD</u> target property is treated as a
       requirement.  If this property is <b>OFF</b> or unset, the <u>CXX_STANDARD</u> target property is treated  as  optional
       and  may  "decay"  to  a previous standard if the requested is not available.  For compilers that have no
       notion of a standard level, such as MSVC 1800 (Visual Studio 2013) and lower, this has no effect.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u> manual for information on compile features  and  a  list  of  supported
       compilers.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u> variable if it is set when a
       target is created.

   <b>DEBUG_POSTFIX</b>
       See target property <u>&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX</u>.

       This   property  is  a  special  case  of  the  more-general  <u>&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX</u>  property  for  the  <b>DEBUG</b>
       configuration.

   <b>DEFINE_SYMBOL</b>
       Define a symbol when compiling this target's sources.

       <b>DEFINE_SYMBOL</b> sets the name of the preprocessor  symbol  defined  when  compiling  sources  in  a  shared
       library.   If  not  set  here then it is set to <b>target_EXPORTS</b> by default (with some substitutions if the
       target is not a valid C identifier).  This is useful for headers to know whether they are being  included
       from inside their library or outside to properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations on Windows.

       On POSIX platforms, this can optionally be used to control the visibility of symbols.

       CMake provides support for such decorations with the <u>GenerateExportHeader</u> module.

   <b>DEPLOYMENT_ADDITIONAL_FILES</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       Set  the  WinCE project <b>AdditionalFiles</b> in <b>DeploymentTool</b> in <b>.vcproj</b> files generated by the <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u>
       <u>Generators</u>.  This is useful when you want to debug on remote WinCE device.  Specify additional files that
       will be copied to the device.  For example:

          set_property(TARGET ${TARGET} PROPERTY
            DEPLOYMENT_ADDITIONAL_FILES "english.lng|local_folder|remote_folder|0"
            "german.lng|local_folder|remote_folder|0")

       produces:

          &lt;DeploymentTool AdditionalFiles="english.lng|local_folder|remote_folder|0;german.lng|local_folder|remote_folder|0" ... /&gt;

   <b>DEPLOYMENT_REMOTE_DIRECTORY</b>
       Added in version 3.6.

       Set the WinCE project <b>RemoteDirectory</b> in <b>DeploymentTool</b> and <b>RemoteExecutable</b> in <b>DebuggerTool</b>  in  <b>.vcproj</b>
       files  generated  by the <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>.  This is useful when you want to debug on remote WinCE
       device.  For example:

          set_property(TARGET ${TARGET} PROPERTY
            DEPLOYMENT_REMOTE_DIRECTORY "\\FlashStorage")

       produces:

          &lt;DeploymentTool RemoteDirectory="\FlashStorage" ... /&gt;
          &lt;DebuggerTool RemoteExecutable="\FlashStorage\target_file" ... /&gt;

   <b>DEPRECATION</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       Deprecation message from imported target's developer.

       <b>DEPRECATION</b> is the message regarding a deprecation status to  be  displayed  to  downstream  users  of  a
       target.

       The message is formatted as follows:

       • Lines that do not start in whitespace are wrapped as paragraph text.

       • Lines that start in whitespace are preserved as preformatted text.

   <b>DISABLE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Disables the precompilation of header files specified by <u>PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</u> property.

       If the property is not set, CMake will use the value provided by <u>CMAKE_DISABLE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</u>.

   <b>DLL_NAME_WITH_SOVERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       This  property  controls  whether the <u>SOVERSION</u> target property is added to the filename of generated DLL
       filenames for the Windows platform, which is selected when the <u>WIN32</u> variable is set.

       The value of the listed property is appended to the basename of  the  runtime  component  of  the  shared
       library target as <b>-&lt;SOVERSION&gt;</b>.

       Please  note  that  setting this property has no effect if versioned filenames are globally disabled with
       the <u>CMAKE_PLATFORM_NO_VERSIONED_SONAME</u> variable.

   <b>DOTNET_SDK</b>
       Added in version 3.23.

       Specify the .NET SDK for C# projects.  For example: <b>Microsoft.NET.Sdk</b>.

       This property tells <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> for VS 2019 and above to generate a .NET  SDK-style  project
       using  the  specified  SDK.  The property is meaningful only to these generators, and only in C# targets.
       It is ignored for C++ projects, even if they are managed (e.g. using <u>COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME</u>).

       This property must be a non-empty string to generate .NET SDK-style projects.  CMake does not perform any
       validations for the value of the property.

       This property may be initialized for all targets using the <u>CMAKE_DOTNET_SDK</u> variable.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The  <u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u>  in  this  version  of  CMake  have  not  yet   learned   to   support
          <u>add_custom_command()</u>  in .NET SDK-style projects.  It is currently an error to attach a custom command
          to a target with the <b>DOTNET_SDK</b> property set.

   <b>DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       Specify the .NET target framework.

       Used to specify the .NET target framework for C++/CLI and C#.  For example: <b>netcoreapp2.1</b>.

       This property is only evaluated for <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> VS 2010 and above.

       Can be initialized for all targets using the variable <u>CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK</u>.

   <b>DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       Specify the .NET target framework version.

       Used to specify the .NET target framework version for C++/CLI and C#.  For example: <b>v4.5</b>.

       This property is only evaluated for <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> VS 2010 and above.

       To   initialize   this    variable    for    all    targets    set    <u>CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK</u>    or
       <u>CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION</u>. If both are set, the latter is ignored.

   <b>EchoString</b>
       A message to be displayed when the target is built.

       A message to display on some generators (such as <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u>) when the target is built.

   <b>ENABLE_EXPORTS</b>
       Specify whether an executable or a shared library exports symbols.

       Normally  an  executable does not export any symbols because it is the final program.  It is possible for
       an executable to export symbols to be used by loadable modules.  When this property is set to true  CMake
       will  allow  other  targets to "link" to the executable with the <u>target_link_libraries()</u> command.  On all
       platforms a target-level dependency on the executable is created for targets that link to  it.   Handling
       of the executable on the link lines of the loadable modules varies by platform:

       • On Windows-based systems (including Cygwin) an "import library" is created along with the executable to
         list the exported symbols.  Loadable modules link to the import library to get the symbols.

       • On macOS, loadable modules link to the executable itself using the <b>-bundle_loader</b> flag.

       • On  AIX,  a  linker "import file" is created along with the executable to list the exported symbols for
         import when linking other targets.  Loadable modules link to the import file to get the symbols.

       • On other platforms, loadable modules are simply linked without referencing  the  executable  since  the
         dynamic loader will automatically bind symbols when the module is loaded.

       This  property  is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_ENABLE_EXPORTS</u> variable, if it is set
       when  an  executable  target  is  created.   If   <u>CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_ENABLE_EXPORTS</u>   is   not   set,   the
       <u>CMAKE_ENABLE_EXPORTS</u>  variable  is  used  to  initialize  the property instead for backward compatibility
       reasons.  See below for alternative initialization behavior for shared library targets.

       Added in version 3.27: To link with a shared library on macOS, or to a  shared  framework  on  any  Apple
       platform,  a  linker  import  file  can be used instead of the actual shared library. These linker import
       files are also known as text-based stubs, and they have a <b>.tbd</b> file extension.

       The generation of these linker import files,  as  well  as  their  consumption,  is  controlled  by  this
       property.  When  this property is set to true on a shared library target, CMake will generate a <b>.tbd</b> file
       for the library.  Other targets that link to the shared library target will then use this <b>.tbd</b> file  when
       linking rather than linking to the shared library binary.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          For    backward    compatibility    reasons,    this    property    will    be    ignored    if    the
          <u>XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_GENERATE_TEXT_BASED_STUBS</u>          target          property           or           the
          <u>CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_GENERATE_TEXT_BASED_STUBS</u> variable is set to false.

       For    shared    library    targets,    this    property   is   initialized   by   the   value   of   the
       <u>CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_ENABLE_EXPORTS</u> variable, if it is set when the target is created.

   <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b>
       Set this target property to a true (or false) value to exclude (or include) the  target  from  the  "all"
       target  of  the containing directory and its ancestors.  If excluded, running e.g. <b>make</b> in the containing
       directory or its ancestors will not build the target by default.

       If this target property is not set then the target will be included in the "all" target of the containing
       directory.  Furthermore, it will be included in the "all" target of its ancestor directories  unless  the
       <u>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</u> directory property is set.

       With  <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b>  set  to false or not set at all, the target will be brought up to date as part of
       doing a <b>make</b> <b>install</b> or its equivalent for the CMake generator being used.

       If a target has <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b> set to true, it may still be listed in an <u>install(TARGETS)</u> command,  but
       the  user  is responsible for ensuring that the target's build artifacts are not missing or outdated when
       an install is performed.

       This   property   may   use   "generator   expressions"    with    the    syntax    <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.    See    the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.

       Only  the "Ninja Multi-Config" generator supports a property value that varies by configuration.  For all
       other generators the value of this property must be the same for all configurations.

   <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD</b>
       Exclude target from <b>Build</b> <b>Solution</b>.

       This property is only used by Visual Studio generators.  When set to <b>TRUE</b>, the target will not  be  built
       when you press <b>Build</b> <b>Solution</b>.

   <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration version of target exclusion from <b>Build</b> <b>Solution</b>.

       This   is   the   configuration-specific   version   of   <u>EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD</u>.    If  the  generic
       <u>EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD</u> is also set on a target, <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> takes  precedence
       in configurations for which it has a value.

   <b>EXPORT_BUILD_DATABASE</b>
       Added in version 3.31.

       Enable/Disable output of a build database for a target.

       This property is initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_EXPORT_BUILD_DATABASE</u> if it is set when a
       target is created.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property is meaningful only when experimental support for build databases has been enabled by the
          <b>CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_EXPORT_BUILD_DATABASE</b> gate.

   <b>EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS</b>
       Added in version 3.20.

       Enable/Disable output of compile commands during generation for a target.

       This property is initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS</u> if it is set when
       a target is created.

   <b>EXPORT_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME</b>
       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Experimental. Gated by <b>CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_EXPORT_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES</b>.

       Control  the  package name associated with a dependency target when exporting a <u>find_dependency()</u> call in
       <u>install(EXPORT)</u> or <u>export(EXPORT)</u>. This can be used to assign a package name to a package that  is  built
       by CMake and exported, or to override the package in the <u>find_package()</u> call that created the target.

       This property is initialized by <u>CMAKE_EXPORT_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME</u>.

   <b>EXPORT_NAME</b>
       Exported name for target files.

       This  sets  the  name for the <b>IMPORTED</b> target generated by the <u>install(EXPORT)</u> and <u>export()</u> commands.  If
       not set, the logical target name is used by default.

   <b>EXPORT_NO_SYSTEM</b>
       Added in version 3.25.

       This property affects the behavior of the <u>install(EXPORT)</u> and <u>export()</u>  commands  when  they  install  or
       export  the  target  respectively.   When  <b>EXPORT_NO_SYSTEM</b>  is  set  to true, those commands generate an
       imported target with <u>SYSTEM</u> property set to false.

       See the <u>NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED</u> target property to set this behavior on the target <u>consuming</u> the  include
       directories rather than the one <u>providing</u> them.

   <b>EXPORT_PROPERTIES</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       List additional properties to export for a target.

       This  property  contains  a  list  of  property  names that should be exported by the <u>install(EXPORT)</u> and
       <u>export()</u> commands.  By default only a limited number of properties are exported.  This  property  can  be
       used to additionally export other properties as well.

       Properties  starting with <b>INTERFACE_</b> or <b>IMPORTED_</b> are not allowed as they are reserved for internal CMake
       use.

       Properties containing generator expressions are also not allowed.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Since CMake 3.19, <u>Interface</u> <u>Libraries</u> may have arbitrary target properties.  If a project  exports  an
          interface  library  with  custom  properties,  the  resulting  package  may  not  work with dependents
          configured by older versions of CMake that reject the custom properties.

   <b>FOLDER</b>
       For IDEs that present targets using a folder hierarchy, this property specifies the name of the folder to
       place the target under.  To nest folders, use  <b>FOLDER</b>  values  such  as  <b>GUI/Dialogs</b>  with  <b>/</b>  characters
       separating  folder  levels.   Targets with no <b>FOLDER</b> property will appear as top level entities.  Targets
       with the same <b>FOLDER</b> property value will appear in the same folder as siblings.

       Only some CMake generators honor the <b>FOLDER</b> property (e.g. <u>Xcode</u> or any of the <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> generators).
       Those generators that don't will simply ignore it.

       This property is initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_FOLDER</u> if it is  set  when  a  target  is
       created.

       The global property <u>USE_FOLDERS</u> must be set to true, otherwise the <b>FOLDER</b> property is ignored.

   <b>Fortran_BUILDING_INSTRINSIC_MODULES</b>
       Added in version 3.22.

       Instructs  the  CMake  Fortran preprocessor that the target is building Fortran intrinsics for building a
       Fortran compiler.

       This property is off by default and should be turned only on projects that build a Fortran  compiler.  It
       should not be turned on for projects that use a Fortran compiler.

       Turning  this  property on will correctly add dependencies for building Fortran intrinsic modules whereas
       turning the property off will ignore Fortran intrinsic modules  in  the  dependency  graph  as  they  are
       supplied by the compiler itself.

   <b>Fortran_FORMAT</b>
       Set to <b>FIXED</b> or <b>FREE</b> to indicate the Fortran source layout.

       This  property  tells CMake whether the Fortran source files in a target use fixed-format or free-format.
       CMake will pass the corresponding format flag to the compiler.  Use  the  source-specific  <b>Fortran_FORMAT</b>
       property  to  change  the  format of a specific source file.  If the variable <u>CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT</u> is set
       when a target is created its value is used to initialize this property.

   <b>Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY</b>
       Specify output directory for Fortran modules provided by the target.

       If the target contains Fortran source files that provide modules  and  the  compiler  supports  a  module
       output directory this specifies the directory in which the modules will be placed.  When this property is
       not set the modules will be placed in the build directory corresponding to the target's source directory.
       If  the  variable  <u>CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY</u>  is  set  when a target is created its value is used to
       initialize this property.

       When using one of the <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> with the Intel Fortran plugin installed in Visual  Studio,
       a subdirectory named after the configuration will be appended to the path where modules are created.  For
       example,  if  <b>Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY</b>  is set to <b>C:/some/path</b>, modules will end up in <b>C:/some/path/Debug</b>
       (or <b>C:/some/path/Release</b> etc.) when an Intel Fortran <b>.vfproj</b> file is generated, and in <b>C:/some/path</b>  when
       any other generator is used.

       Note  that  some  compilers will automatically search the module output directory for modules USEd during
       compilation but others will not.  If your sources  USE  modules  their  location  must  be  specified  by
       <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> regardless of this property.

   <b>Fortran_PREPROCESS</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       Control whether the Fortran source file should be unconditionally preprocessed.

       If  unset  or  empty,  rely  on  the  compiler  to  determine whether the file should be preprocessed. If
       explicitly set to <b>OFF</b> then the file does not need to be preprocessed. If explicitly set to <b>ON</b>,  then  the
       file does need to be preprocessed as part of the compilation step.

       When  using  the  <u>Ninja</u>  generator,  all  source files are first preprocessed in order to generate module
       dependency information. Setting this property to <b>OFF</b> will make <b>Ninja</b> skip this step.

       Use the source-specific <u>Fortran_PREPROCESS</u> property if a single file needs to  be  preprocessed.  If  the
       variable  <u>CMAKE_Fortran_PREPROCESS</u>  is  set when a target is created its value is used to initialize this
       property.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          For some compilers, <b>NAG</b>, <b>PGI</b> and <b>Solaris</b> <b>Studio</b>, setting this to <b>OFF</b> will have no effect.

   <b>FRAMEWORK</b>
       Build <b>SHARED</b> or <b>STATIC</b> library as Framework Bundle on the macOS and iOS.

       If such a library target has this property set to <b>TRUE</b> it will be built as a framework when built on  the
       macOS  and iOS.  It will have the directory structure required for a framework and will be suitable to be
       used with the <b>-framework</b> option.  This property is  initialized  by  the  value  of  the  <u>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK</u>
       variable if it is set when a target is created.

       To customize <b>Info.plist</b> file in the framework, use <u>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST</u> target property.

       For macOS see also the <u>FRAMEWORK_VERSION</u> target property.

       Example of creation <b>dynamicFramework</b>:

          add_library(dynamicFramework SHARED
                      dynamicFramework.c
                      dynamicFramework.h
          )
          set_target_properties(dynamicFramework PROPERTIES
            FRAMEWORK TRUE
            FRAMEWORK_VERSION C
            MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER com.cmake.dynamicFramework
            MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST Info.plist
            # "current version" in semantic format in Mach-O binary file
            VERSION 16.4.0
            # "compatibility version" in semantic format in Mach-O binary file
            SOVERSION 1.0.0
            PUBLIC_HEADER dynamicFramework.h
            XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY "iPhone Developer"
          )

   <b>FRAMEWORK_MULTI_CONFIG_POSTFIX_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       Postfix  to  append  to  the  framework  file  name for configuration <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>, when using a multi-config
       generator (like Xcode and Ninja Multi-Config).

       When building with configuration <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> the value of this property is appended to  the  framework  file
       name built on disk.

       For    example,    given    a    framework    called    <b>my_fw</b>,    a    value    of    <b>_debug</b>    for   the
       <b>FRAMEWORK_MULTI_CONFIG_POSTFIX_DEBUG</b>  property,  and  <b>Debug;Release</b>  in  <u>CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES</u>,   the
       following relevant files would be created for the <b>Debug</b> and <b>Release</b> configurations:

       • <b>Release/my_fw.framework/my_fw</b>

       • <b>Release/my_fw.framework/Versions/A/my_fw</b>

       • <b>Debug/my_fw.framework/my_fw_debug</b>

       • <b>Debug/my_fw.framework/Versions/A/my_fw_debug</b>

       For     framework    targets,    this    property    is    initialized    by    the    value    of    the
       <u>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_MULTI_CONFIG_POSTFIX_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> variable if it is set when a target is created.

       This property is ignored for non-framework targets, and when using single config generators.

   <b>FRAMEWORK_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Version of a framework created using the <u>FRAMEWORK</u> target property (e.g. <b>A</b>).

       This property only affects macOS, as iOS doesn't have versioned directory structure.

   <b>GENERATOR_FILE_NAME</b>
       Generator's file for this target.

       An internal property used by some generators to record the name of the project  or  dsp  file  associated
       with  this  target.   Note  that  at  configure  time,  this  property is only set for targets created by
       <u>include_external_msproject()</u>.

   <b>GHS_INTEGRITY_APP</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       <b>ON</b> / <b>OFF</b> boolean to determine if an executable target should be treated as an <u>Integrity</u> <u>Application</u>.

       If no value is set and if a <b>.int</b> file is added as a source file to  the  executable  target  it  will  be
       treated as an <u>Integrity</u> <u>Application</u>.

       Supported on <u>Green</u> <u>Hills</u> <u>MULTI</u>.

   <b>GHS_NO_SOURCE_GROUP_FILE</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       <b>ON</b> / <b>OFF</b> boolean to control if the project file for a target should be one single file or multiple files.

       The  default behavior or when the property is <b>OFF</b> is to generate a project file for the target and then a
       sub-project file for each source group.

       When this property is <b>ON</b> or if <u>CMAKE_GHS_NO_SOURCE_GROUP_FILE</u> is <b>ON</b> then only a single  project  file  is
       generated for the target.

       Supported on <u>Green</u> <u>Hills</u> <u>MULTI</u>.

   <b>GNUtoMS</b>
       Convert GNU import library (<b>.dll.a</b>) to MS format (<b>.lib</b>).

       When  linking a shared library or executable that exports symbols using GNU tools on Windows (MinGW/MSYS)
       with Visual Studio installed convert the import library (<b>.dll.a</b>) from GNU  to  MS  format  (<b>.lib</b>).   Both
       import  libraries  will be installed by <u>install(TARGETS)</u> and exported by <u>install(EXPORT)</u> and  <u>export()</u> to
       be linked by applications with either GNU- or MS-compatible tools.

       If the variable <b>CMAKE_GNUtoMS</b> is set when a target is created  its  value  is  used  to  initialize  this
       property.   The variable must be set prior to the first command that enables a language such as <u>project()</u>
       or <u>enable_language()</u>.  CMake  provides  the  variable  as  an  option  to  the  user  automatically  when
       configuring on Windows with GNU tools.

   <b>HAS_CXX</b>
       Link the target using the C++ linker tool (obsolete).

       This is equivalent to setting the <u>LINKER_LANGUAGE</u> property to <b>CXX</b>.

   <b>HEADER_DIRS</b>
       Added in version 3.23.

       Semicolon-separated  list  of base directories of the target's default header set (i.e. the file set with
       name and type <b>HEADERS</b>). The property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       This property is normally only set by <u>target_sources(FILE_SET)</u> rather than being manipulated directly.

       See <u>HEADER_DIRS_&lt;NAME&gt;</u> for the list of base directories in other header sets.

   <b>HEADER_DIRS_&lt;NAME&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.23.

       Semicolon-separated list of base directories of the target's <b>&lt;NAME&gt;</b> header set, which has  the  set  type
       <b>HEADERS</b>. The property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       This property is normally only set by <u>target_sources(FILE_SET)</u> rather than being manipulated directly.

       See  <u>HEADER_DIRS</u> for the list of base directories in the default header set. See <u>HEADER_SETS</u> for the file
       set names of all header sets.

   <b>HEADER_SET</b>
       Added in version 3.23.

       Semicolon-separated list of files in the target's default header set, (i.e. the file set  with  name  and
       type  <b>HEADERS</b>).  If  any  of  the  paths  are relative, they are computed relative to the target's source
       directory.  The property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       This property is normally only set by <u>target_sources(FILE_SET)</u> rather than being manipulated directly.

       See <u>HEADER_SET_&lt;NAME&gt;</u> for the list of files in other header sets.

   <b>HEADER_SET_&lt;NAME&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.23.

       Semicolon-separated list of files in the target's <b>&lt;NAME&gt;</b> header set, which has the set type  <b>HEADERS</b>.  If
       any  of the paths are relative, they are computed relative to the target's source directory. The property
       supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       This property is normally only set by <u>target_sources(FILE_SET)</u> rather than being manipulated directly.

       See <u>HEADER_SET</u> for the list of files in the default header set.  See <u>HEADER_SETS</u> for the file  set  names
       of all header sets.

   <b>HEADER_SETS</b>
       Added in version 3.23.

       Read-only  list  of  the  target's  <b>PRIVATE</b>  and  <b>PUBLIC</b>  header  sets (i.e.  all file sets with the type
       <b>HEADERS</b>). Files listed in these file sets are treated as source files for the purpose of IDE integration.
       The files also have their <u>HEADER_FILE_ONLY</u> property set to <b>TRUE</b>.

       Header sets may be defined using the <u>target_sources()</u> command <b>FILE_SET</b> option with type <b>HEADERS</b>.

       See also <u>HEADER_SET_&lt;NAME&gt;</u>, <u>HEADER_SET</u> and <u>INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS</u>.

   <b>HIP_ARCHITECTURES</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       List of GPU architectures to for which to generate device code.  Architecture names are interpreted based
       on <u>CMAKE_HIP_PLATFORM</u>.

       A non-empty false value (e.g. <b>OFF</b>) disables adding architectures.  This is intended to support  packagers
       and rare cases where full control over the passed flags is required.

       This  property  is  initialized  by the value of the <u>CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES</u> variable if it is set when a
       target is created.

       The HIP compilation model has two modes: whole and separable. Whole compilation generates device code  at
       compile  time.  Separable compilation generates device code at link time. Therefore the <b>HIP_ARCHITECTURES</b>
       target property should be set on targets that compile or link with any HIP sources.

   <b>Examples</b>
          set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY HIP_ARCHITECTURES gfx801 gfx900)

       Generates code for both <b>gfx801</b> and <b>gfx900</b>.

   <b>HIP_EXTENSIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.

       This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be used.  For  some  compilers,  this
       results  in  adding a flag such as <b>-std=gnu++11</b> instead of <b>-std=c++11</b> to the compile line.  This property
       is <b>ON</b> by default. The basic HIP/C++ standard level is controlled by the <u>HIP_STANDARD</u> target property.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u> manual for information on compile features  and  a  list  of  supported
       compilers.

       This  property  is  initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_HIP_EXTENSIONS</u> variable if set when a target is
       created and otherwise by the value of <u>CMAKE_HIP_EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT</u> (see <u>CMP0128</u>).

   <b>HIP_STANDARD</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       The HIP/C++ standard requested to build this target.

       Supported values are:

       <b>98</b>     HIP C++98

       <b>11</b>     HIP C++11

       <b>14</b>     HIP C++14

       <b>17</b>     HIP C++17

       <b>20</b>     HIP C++20

       <b>23</b>     HIP C++23

       <b>26</b>     Added in version 3.25.

              HIP C++26. CMake 3.25 and later <u>recognize</u> <b>26</b> as a valid value, no  version  has  support  for  any
              compiler.

       If  the value requested does not result in a compile flag being added for the compiler in use, a previous
       standard flag will be added instead.  This means that using:

          set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY HIP_STANDARD 11)

       with a compiler which does not support <b>-std=gnu++11</b> or an equivalent flag will not result in an error  or
       warning,  but  will  instead  add  the  <b>-std=gnu++98</b>  flag  if  supported.   This "decay" behavior may be
       controlled with the <u>HIP_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>  target  property.   Additionally,  the  <u>HIP_EXTENSIONS</u>  target
       property may be used to control whether compiler-specific extensions are enabled on a per-target basis.

       See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  information on compile features and a list of supported
       compilers.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_HIP_STANDARD</u> variable if it is set when  a  target
       is created.

   <b>HIP_STANDARD_REQUIRED</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       Boolean describing whether the value of <u>HIP_STANDARD</u> is a requirement.

       If  this  property  is  set  to  <b>ON</b>,  then  the value of the <u>HIP_STANDARD</u> target property is treated as a
       requirement.  If this property is <b>OFF</b> or unset, the <u>HIP_STANDARD</u> target property is treated  as  optional
       and may "decay" to a previous standard if the requested is not available.

       See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  information on compile features and a list of supported
       compilers.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_HIP_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u> variable if it is set when a
       target is created.

   <b>IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM</b>
       Specify <b>#include</b> line transforms for dependencies in a target.

       This property specifies rules to transform macro-like <b>#include</b> lines during implicit dependency  scanning
       of  C  and  C++  source files.  The list of rules must be semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
       <b>A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%</b> (the <b>%</b> must be literal).  During dependency scanning occurrences of  <b>A_MACRO(...)</b>
       on  <b>#include</b>  lines  will  be replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for <b>%</b>.  For
       example, the entry

          MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;

       will convert lines of the form

          #include MYDIR(myheader.h)

       to

          #include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;

       allowing the dependency to be followed.

       This property applies to sources in the target on which it is set.

   <b>IMPORTED</b>
       Read-only indication of whether a target is <b>IMPORTED</b>.

       The  boolean  value  of  this  property  is  <b>True</b>  for  targets  created  with  the  <b>IMPORTED</b>  option  to
       <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u>.  It is <b>False</b> for targets built within the project.

   <b>IMPORTED_COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       Property to define if the target uses <b>C++/CLI</b>.

       Ignored for non-imported targets.

       See also the <u>COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME</u> target property.

   <b>IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS</b>
       Configurations provided for an <u>imported</u> <u>target</u>.

       Set  this  to  the  list of configuration names available for an imported target.  For each configuration
       named, the imported target's artifacts must be specified in other target properties:

       • <u>IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>, or

       • <u>IMPORTED_IMPLIB_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> (on DLL platforms, on AIX for <u>Executables</u> or on Apple for  <u>Shared</u>  <u>Libraries</u>),
         or

       • <u>IMPORTED_OBJECTS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> (for <u>Object</u> <u>Libraries</u>), or

       • <u>IMPORTED_LIBNAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> (for <u>Interface</u> <u>Libraries</u>).

       The configuration names correspond to those defined in the project from which the target is imported.  If
       the  importing  project  uses  a  different  set  of  configurations,  the  names may be mapped using the
       <u>MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> target property.

       The <b>IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS</b> property is ignored for non-imported targets.

   <b>IMPORTED_CXX_MODULES_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.28.

       Preprocessor definitions for compiling an <b>IMPORTED</b> target's C++ module sources.

       CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported by the native build tool.

   <b>IMPORTED_CXX_MODULES_COMPILE_FEATURES</b>
       Added in version 3.28.

       Compiler features enabled for this <b>IMPORTED</b> target's C++ modules.

       The value of this property is used by the generators to set the include paths for the compiler.

   <b>IMPORTED_CXX_MODULES_COMPILE_OPTIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.28.

       List of options to pass to the compiler for this <b>IMPORTED</b> target's C++ modules.

   <b>Option</b> <b>De-duplication</b>
       The final set of options used for a target is constructed by accumulating options from the current target
       and the usage requirements of its dependencies.  The set of options is de-duplicated to avoid repetition.

       Added in version 3.12: While beneficial for individual options, the  de-duplication  step  can  break  up
       option groups.  For example, <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>-option</b> <b>B</b> becomes <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>B</b>.  One may specify a group of options
       using  shell-like  quoting along with a <b>SHELL:</b> prefix.  The <b>SHELL:</b> prefix is dropped, and the rest of the
       option string is parsed using the <u>separate_arguments()</u> <b>UNIX_COMMAND</b> mode. For example, <b>"SHELL:-option</b>  <b>A"</b>
       <b>"SHELL:-option</b> <b>B"</b> becomes <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>-option</b> <b>B</b>.

   <b>IMPORTED_CXX_MODULES_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.28.

       List of preprocessor include file search directories when compiling C++ modules for <b>IMPORTED</b> targets.

       The value of this property is used by the generators to set the include paths for the compiler.

   <b>IMPORTED_CXX_MODULES_LINK_LIBRARIES</b>
       Added in version 3.28.

       List of direct dependencies to use for usage requirements for C++ modules in the target's C++ modules.

   <b>IMPORTED_GLOBAL</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       Indication of whether an <u>IMPORTED</u> <u>target</u> is globally visible.

       The  boolean  value  of  this  property  is  True for targets created with the <b>IMPORTED</b> <b>GLOBAL</b> options to
       <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u>. It is always False for targets built within the project.

       For targets created with the <b>IMPORTED</b>  option  to  <u>add_executable()</u>  or  <u>add_library()</u>  but  without  the
       additional  option  <b>GLOBAL</b> this is False, too. However, setting this property for such a locally <b>IMPORTED</b>
       target to True promotes that target to global scope.  This  promotion  can  only  be  done  in  the  same
       directory where that <b>IMPORTED</b> target was created in the first place.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Once an imported target has been made global, it cannot be changed back to non-global. Therefore, if a
          project  sets  this  property,  it  may only provide a value of True. CMake will issue an error if the
          project tries to set the property to a non-True value, even if the value was already False.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Local <u>ALIAS</u> <u>targets</u> created before promoting an <u>IMPORTED</u> <u>target</u>  from  <b>LOCAL</b>  to  <b>GLOBAL</b>,  keep  their
          initial scope (see <u>ALIAS_GLOBAL</u> target property).

   <b>IMPORTED_IMPLIB</b>
       Full path to the import library for an <b>IMPORTED</b> target.

       This property may be set:

       • On DLL platforms, to the location of the <b>.lib</b> part of the DLL.

       • Added  in  version  3.16:  On  AIX,  to  an import file (e.g. <b>.imp</b>) created for executables that export
         symbols (see the <u>ENABLE_EXPORTS</u> target property).

       • Added in version 3.27: On Apple platforms, to an import file (e.g. <b>.tbd</b>) created for  shared  libraries
         or  frameworks  (see  the <u>ENABLE_EXPORTS</u> target property).  For frameworks, this is the location of the
         <b>.tbd</b> file symlink just inside the framework folder.

       • Added in version 3.28: On non-DLL platforms, to the location of a shared  library.   When  set  without
         also specifying an <u>IMPORTED_LOCATION</u>, the library is considered to be a stub, and its location will not
         be added as a runtime search path to dependents that link it.

       Changed  in  version  3.28:  If  an  imported  target is an Apple framework or XCFramework, the preferred
       arrangement is to set <u>IMPORTED_LOCATION</u> to the <b>.framework</b> or <b>.xcframework</b>  directory.   CMake  will  then
       find  the  relevant  <b>.tbd</b>  file  inside  that  framework  or  XCFramework automatically without requiring
       <b>IMPORTED_IMPLIB</b> to be set.

       The <b>IMPORTED_IMPLIB</b> target property  may  be  overridden  for  a  given  configuration  <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>  by  the
       configuration-specific      <u>IMPORTED_IMPLIB_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>      target      property.      Furthermore,     the
       <u>MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> target property may be used to map between a  project's  configurations  and
       those  of an imported target.  If none of these is set then the name of any other configuration listed in
       the <u>IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS</u> target property may be selected and its <u>IMPORTED_IMPLIB_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> value used.

       This property is ignored for non-imported targets.

   <b>IMPORTED_IMPLIB_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of <u>IMPORTED_IMPLIB</u> property.

       Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.

   <b>IMPORTED_LIBNAME</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Specify the link library name for an <u>imported</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>Library</u>.

       An interface library builds no library file itself but does specify usage requirements for its consumers.
       The <b>IMPORTED_LIBNAME</b> property may be set to specify a single library name to be placed on the  link  line
       in place of the interface library target name as a requirement for using the interface.

       This  property is intended for use in naming libraries provided by a platform SDK for which the full path
       to a library file may not be known.  The value may be a plain library name such as <b>foo</b> but may <u>not</u>  be  a
       path  (e.g.  <b>/usr/lib/libfoo.so</b>) or a flag (e.g. <b>-Wl,...</b>).  The name is never treated as a library target
       name even if it happens to name one.

       The <b>IMPORTED_LIBNAME</b> property is allowed only on <u>imported</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>Libraries</u> and is rejected on  targets
       of other types (for which the <u>IMPORTED_LOCATION</u> target property may be used).

   <b>IMPORTED_LIBNAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of <u>IMPORTED_LIBNAME</u> property.

       Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.

   <b>IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES</b>
       Dependent shared libraries of an imported shared library.

       Shared  libraries  may  be  linked  to  other  shared libraries as part of their implementation.  On some
       platforms the linker searches for the dependent libraries of shared libraries they are including  in  the
       link.   Set  this  property  to  the list of dependent shared libraries of an imported library.  The list
       should be disjoint from the list of interface libraries in  the  <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>  property.   On
       platforms  requiring  dependent  shared  libraries  to  be found at link time CMake uses this list to add
       appropriate files or paths to the link command line.  Ignored for non-imported targets.

   <b>IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of <u>IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES</u>.

       Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target  is  imported.   If
       set, this property completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

   <b>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES</b>
       Languages compiled into an <b>IMPORTED</b> static library.

       Set  this to the list of languages of source files compiled to produce a <b>STATIC</b> <b>IMPORTED</b> library (such as
       <b>C</b> or <b>CXX</b>).  CMake accounts for these languages when computing how  to  link  a  target  to  the  imported
       library.   For example, when a C executable links to an imported C++ static library CMake chooses the C++
       linker to satisfy language runtime dependencies of the static library.

       This property is ignored for targets that are  not  <b>STATIC</b>  libraries.   This  property  is  ignored  for
       non-imported targets.

   <b>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of <u>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES</u>.

       Configuration  names  correspond  to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.  If
       set, this property completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

   <b>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</b>
       Transitive link interface of an <b>IMPORTED</b> target.

       Set this to the list of libraries whose interface is included when an <b>IMPORTED</b> library target  is  linked
       to  another  target.   The  libraries  will  be  included  on  the  link line for the target.  Unlike the
       <u>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</u> property, this property applies to all imported target types,  including  <b>STATIC</b>
       libraries.  This property is ignored for non-imported targets.

       This property is ignored if the target also has a non-empty <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> property.

       This property is deprecated.  Use <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> instead.

   <b>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of <u>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</u>.

       Configuration  names  correspond  to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.  If
       set, this property completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

       This property is ignored if the target also has a non-empty <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> property.

       This property is deprecated.  Use <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> instead.

   <b>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY</b>
       Repetition count for cycles of <b>IMPORTED</b> static libraries.

       This is <u>LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY</u> for <b>IMPORTED</b> targets.

   <b>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of <u>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY</u>.

       If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

   <b>IMPORTED_LOCATION</b>
       Full path to the main file on disk for an <b>IMPORTED</b> target.

       Set this to the location of an <b>IMPORTED</b> target file on disk.  For executables this is the location of the
       executable file.  For <b>STATIC</b> libraries and modules this is the location of the library  or  module.   For
       <b>SHARED</b>  libraries  on  non-DLL  platforms  this  is  the location of the shared library.  For application
       bundles on macOS this is the location of the executable file  inside  <b>Contents/MacOS</b>  within  the  bundle
       folder.   For  frameworks  on  macOS  this  is  the  location of the library file symlink just inside the
       framework folder.  For DLLs this is the location of the <b>.dll</b> part of the library.  For <b>UNKNOWN</b>  libraries
       this is the location of the file to be linked.  Ignored for non-imported targets.

       Added  in  version  3.28:  For  ordinary  frameworks  on Apple platforms, this may be the location of the
       <b>.framework</b> folder itself.  For XCFrameworks, it may be the location of the <b>.xcframework</b> folder, in  which
       case  any  target  that  links  against  it  will get the selected library's <b>Headers</b> directory as a usage
       requirement.

       The <b>IMPORTED_LOCATION</b> target property may be  overridden  for  a  given  configuration  <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>  by  the
       configuration-specific      <u>IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>     target     property.      Furthermore,     the
       <u>MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> target property may be used to map between a  project's  configurations  and
       those  of an imported target.  If none of these is set then the name of any other configuration listed in
       the <u>IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS</u> target property may be  selected  and  its  <u>IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>  value
       used.

       To get the location of an imported target read one of the <u>LOCATION</u> or <u>LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> properties.

       For platforms with import libraries (e.g. Windows, AIX or Apple) see also <u>IMPORTED_IMPLIB</u>.

   <b>IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of <u>IMPORTED_LOCATION</u> property.

       Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.

   <b>IMPORTED_NO_SONAME</b>
       Specifies that an <b>IMPORTED</b> shared library target has no <b>soname</b>.

       Set this property to true for an imported shared library file that has no <b>soname</b> field.  CMake may adjust
       generated  link  commands  for some platforms to prevent the linker from using the path to the library in
       place of its missing <b>soname</b>.  Ignored for non-imported targets.

   <b>IMPORTED_NO_SONAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of <u>IMPORTED_NO_SONAME</u> property.

       Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.

   <b>IMPORTED_OBJECTS</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       A <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of absolute paths to the object files on disk for an <u>imported</u> <u>object</u> <u>library</u>.

       Ignored for non-imported targets.

       Projects may skip <b>IMPORTED_OBJECTS</b> if the configuration-specific  property  <u>IMPORTED_OBJECTS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>  is
       set instead, except in situations as noted in the section below.

   <b>Xcode</b> <b>Generator</b> <b>Considerations</b>
       Added in version 3.20.

       For  Apple  platforms,  a project may be built for more than one architecture.  This is controlled by the
       <u>CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES</u> variable.  For all but the <u>Xcode</u> generator,  CMake  invokes  compilers  once  per
       source  file  and  passes multiple <b>-arch</b> flags, leading to a single object file which will be a universal
       binary.  Such object files work well when listed in the <b>IMPORTED_OBJECTS</b> of a separate CMake build,  even
       for  the  <u>Xcode</u>  generator.   But producing such object files with the <u>Xcode</u> generator is more difficult,
       since it invokes the compiler once per architecture for each source file.  Unlike the  other  generators,
       it does not generate universal object file binaries.

       A  further  complication  with  the  <u>Xcode</u>  generator is that when targeting device platforms (iOS, tvOS,
       visionOS or watchOS), the <u>Xcode</u> generator has the ability to use  either  the  device  or  simulator  SDK
       without needing CMake to be re-run.  The SDK can be selected at build time.  But since some architectures
       can  be  supported by both the device and the simulator SDKs (e.g. <b>arm64</b> with Xcode 12 or later), not all
       combinations can be represented in a single universal binary.  The only solution in this case is to  have
       multiple object files.

       <b>IMPORTED_OBJECTS</b>  doesn't  support  generator  expressions,  so every file it lists needs to be valid for
       every architecture and SDK.  If incorporating object files that are  not  universal  binaries,  the  path
       and/or  file  name  of  each object file has to somehow encapsulate the different architectures and SDKs.
       With the <u>Xcode</u> generator, Xcode variables of the form <b>$(...)</b> can be used to represent these  aspects  and
       Xcode  will substitute the appropriate values at build time.  CMake doesn't interpret these variables and
       embeds them unchanged in  the  Xcode  project  file.   <b>$(CURRENT_ARCH)</b>  can  be  used  to  represent  the
       architecture, while <b>$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)</b> can be used to differentiate between SDKs.

       The  following  shows one example of how these two variables can be used to refer to an object file whose
       location depends on both the SDK and the architecture:

          add_library(someObjs OBJECT IMPORTED)

          set_property(TARGET someObjs PROPERTY IMPORTED_OBJECTS
            # Quotes are required because of the ()
            "/path/to/somewhere/objects$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)/$(CURRENT_ARCH)/func.o"
          )

          # Example paths:
          #   /path/to/somewhere/objects-iphoneos/arm64/func.o
          #   /path/to/somewhere/objects-iphonesimulator/x86_64/func.o

       In some cases, you may want to have configuration-specific object files as  well.   The  <b>$(CONFIGURATION)</b>
       Xcode variable is often used for this and can be used in conjunction with the others mentioned above:

          add_library(someObjs OBJECT IMPORTED)
          set_property(TARGET someObjs PROPERTY IMPORTED_OBJECTS
            "/path/to/somewhere/$(CONFIGURATION)$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)/$(CURRENT_ARCH)/func.o"
          )

          # Example paths:
          #   /path/to/somewhere/Release-iphoneos/arm64/func.o
          #   /path/to/somewhere/Debug-iphonesimulator/x86_64/func.o

       When  any Xcode variable is used, CMake is not able to fully evaluate the path(s) at configure time.  One
       consequence of this is that the configuration-specific  <u>IMPORTED_OBJECTS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>  properties  cannot  be
       used,  since CMake cannot determine whether an object file exists at a particular <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> location.  The
       <b>IMPORTED_OBJECTS</b> property must be used for these situations and the configuration-specific aspects of the
       path should be handled by the <b>$(CONFIGURATION)</b> Xcode variable.

   <b>IMPORTED_OBJECTS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>-specific version of <u>IMPORTED_OBJECTS</u> property.

       Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.

   <b>Xcode</b> <b>Generator</b> <b>Considerations</b>
       Do not use this <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>-specific property if you need to use Xcode  variables  like  <b>$(CURRENT_ARCH)</b>  or
       <b>$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)</b>  in the value.  The <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>-specific properties will be ignored in such cases
       because CMake cannot determine whether a file exists at the configuration-specific path at  configuration
       time.  For such cases, use <u>IMPORTED_OBJECTS</u> instead.

   <b>IMPORTED_SONAME</b>
       The <b>soname</b> of an <b>IMPORTED</b> target of shared library type.

       Set  this  to  the  <b>soname</b>  embedded in an imported shared library.  This is meaningful only on platforms
       supporting the feature.  Ignored for non-imported targets.

   <b>IMPORTED_SONAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of <u>IMPORTED_SONAME</u> property.

       Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.

   <b>IMPORT_PREFIX</b>
       What comes before the import library name.

       Similar to the target property <u>PREFIX</u>, but used for import libraries (typically corresponding to  a  <b>DLL</b>)
       instead  of regular libraries.  A target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as <b>lib</b>) on
       an import library name.

   <b>IMPORT_SUFFIX</b>
       What comes after the import library name.

       Similar to the target property <u>SUFFIX</u>, but used for import libraries (typically corresponding to  a  <b>DLL</b>)
       instead of regular libraries.  A target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as <b>.lib</b>) on
       an import library name.

   <b>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b>
       List of preprocessor include file search directories.

       This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the <u>target_include_directories()</u> command.
       In  addition  to  accepting  values from that command, values may be set directly on any target using the
       <u>set_property()</u> command.  A target gets its initial  value  for  this  property  from  the  value  of  the
       <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>  directory property.  Both directory and target property values are adjusted by calls
       to the <u>include_directories()</u> command.

       The value of this property is used by the generators to set the include paths for the compiler.

       Relative paths should not be added to this property directly. Use one of the commands  above  instead  to
       handle relative paths.

       Contents  of  <b>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b> may use <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>INSTALL_NAME_DIR</b>
       Directory name for installed targets on Apple platforms.

       <b>INSTALL_NAME_DIR</b> is a string specifying the directory portion  of  the  "install_name"  field  of  shared
       libraries  on  Apple  platforms  for  installed  targets.   When  not  set, the default directory used is
       determined by <u>MACOSX_RPATH</u>.  If the <u>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR</u>  property  is  set,  this  will  be  used
       already in the build tree.  Policies <u>CMP0068</u> and <u>CMP0042</u> are also relevant.

       This  property  is  initialized  by  the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR</u> if it is set when a
       target is created.

       This property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.  In particular, the <u>$&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt;</u> generator  expression
       can be used to set the directory relative to the install-time prefix.

       On  platforms  that  support  runtime  paths  (<b>RPATH</b>), refer to the <u>INSTALL_RPATH</u> target property.  Under
       Windows, the <u>TARGET_RUNTIME_DLLS</u> generator expression is related.

   <b>INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Controls whether toolchain-defined rpaths should be removed during installation.

       When a target is being installed, CMake may need to rewrite its rpath information.  This occurs when  the
       install  rpath  (as  specified  by the <u>INSTALL_RPATH</u> target property) has different contents to the rpath
       that the target was built with.  Some toolchains insert their own rpath contents into the binary as  part
       of  the  build.  By default, CMake will preserve those extra inserted contents in the install rpath.  For
       those scenarios where such toolchain-inserted entries need  to  be  discarded  during  install,  set  the
       <b>INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH</b> target property to true.

       This  property  is  initialized by the value of <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH</u> when the target is
       created.

   <b>INSTALL_RPATH</b>
       The rpath to use for installed targets.

       By default, the install rpath is empty. It can be set using this property, which is a semicolon-separated
       list specifying the rpath to use in installed targets (for platforms that support it).  This property  is
       initialized  by  the  value  of  the  variable <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH</u> if it is set when a target is created.
       Beside setting the install rpath manually, using the <u>INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH</u> target property  it  can
       also be generated automatically by CMake.

       Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building executables etc on systems that use RPATH,
       see  the <u>BUILD_RPATH</u> target property. When the software is installed the targets are edited (or relinked)
       by CMake (see <u>CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH</u>) to have the install RPATH.  This editing during installation  can
       be avoided via the <u>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH</u> target property.

       For handling toolchain-dependent RPATH entries the <u>INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH</u> can be used.  Runtime
       paths can be disabled completely via the <u>CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH</u> variable.

       Because the rpath may contain <b>${ORIGIN}</b>, which coincides with CMake syntax, the contents of <b>INSTALL_RPATH</b>
       are properly escaped in the <b>cmake_install.cmake</b> script (see policy <u>CMP0095</u>.)

       This property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       On   Apple   platforms,   refer   to   the   <u>INSTALL_NAME_DIR</u>   target   property.   Under  Windows,  the
       <u>TARGET_RUNTIME_DLLS</u> generator expression is related.

   <b>INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH</b>
       Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

       <b>INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH</b> is a boolean that if set to <b>TRUE</b> will  append  to  the  runtime  search  path
       (rpath)  of  installed binaries any directories outside the project that are in the linker search path or
       contain linked library files.  The directories are appended after the value of the  <u>INSTALL_RPATH</u>  target
       property.

       This  property is initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH</u> if it is set
       when a target is created.

   <b>INTERFACE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       A <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of macro names for <u>AUTOMOC</u> to be propagated to consumers.

       When a target with <u>AUTOMOC</u> enabled links to a library that sets <b>INTERFACE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES</b>, the target
       inherits the listed macro names and merges them with  those  specified  in  its  own  <u>AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES</u>
       property.   The  target  will  then  automatically  generate  MOC files for source files that contain the
       inherited macro names too, not just the macro names specified in its own <u>AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES</u> property.

       By default <b>INTERFACE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES</b> is empty.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>Example</b> <b>1</b>
       In this example, <b>myapp</b> inherits the macro names <b>STATIC_LIB_1</b> and <b>STATIC_LIB_2</b> from <b>static_lib</b>.   The  <b>moc</b>
       tool  will  then  automatically  be  run  on  any  of  the  <b>myapp</b>  sources  which contain <b>STATIC_LIB_1</b> or
       <b>STATIC_LIB_2</b>.

          set(AUTOMOC ON)
          add_executable(myapp main.cpp)
          target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE static_lib)

          add_library(static_lib STATIC static.cpp)
          set_property(TARGET static_lib PROPERTY
            INTERFACE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES "STATIC_LIB_1;STATIC_LIB_2"
          )

   <b>Example</b> <b>2</b>
       In this example, the <b>INTERFACE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES</b> target property of the  various  <b>*_deep_lib</b>  libraries
       will  propagate  to  <b>shared_lib</b>,  <b>static_lib</b>  and  <b>interface_lib</b>.   Because the linking relationships are
       specified as <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b>, those macro names will also further propagate transitively up to <b>app</b>.

          set(AUTOMOC ON)

          add_library(shared_deep_lib SHARED deep_lib.cpp)
          add_library(static_deep_lib STATIC deep_lib.cpp)
          add_library(interface_deep_lib INTERFACE)

          set_property(TARGET shared_deep_lib PROPERTY
            INTERFACE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES "SHARED_LINK_LIB"
          )
          set_property(TARGET static_deep_lib PROPERTY
            INTERFACE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES "STATIC_LINK_LIB"
          )
          set_property(TARGET interface_deep_lib PROPERTY
            INTERFACE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES "INTERFACE_LINK_LIB"
          )

          add_library(shared_lib SHARED lib.cpp)
          add_library(static_lib STATIC lib.cpp)
          add_library(interface_lib INTERFACE)

          # PUBLIC and INTERFACE here ensure the macro names propagate to any
          # consumers of shared_lib, static_lib or interface_lib too
          target_link_libraries(shared_lib PUBLIC shared_deep_lib)
          target_link_libraries(static_lib PUBLIC static_deep_lib)
          target_link_libraries(interface_lib INTERFACE interface_deep_lib)

          # This consumer will receive all three of the above custom macro names as
          # transitive usage requirements
          add_executable(app main.cpp)
          target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE shared_lib static_lib interface_lib)

       In the above:

       • <b>shared_lib</b> sources will be processed by <b>moc</b> if they contain <b>SHARED_LINK_LIB</b>.

       • <b>static_lib</b> sources will be processed by <b>moc</b> if they contain <b>STATIC_LINK_LIB</b>.

       • <b>app</b>  sources  will  be  processed  by  <b>moc</b>  if  they  contain   <b>SHARED_LINK_LIB</b>,   <b>STATIC_LINK_LIB</b>   or
         <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIB</b>.

   <b>INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.0.

       List of interface options to pass to uic.

       Targets  may  populate this property to publish the options required to use when invoking <b>uic</b>.  Consuming
       targets    can    add    entries    to     their     own     <u>AUTOUIC_OPTIONS</u>     property     such     as
       <b>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS&gt;</b>  to  use  the  uic options specified in the interface of
       <b>foo</b>. This is done automatically by the <u>target_link_libraries()</u> command.

       This  property  supports  generator  expressions.   See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u>  manual  for
       available expressions.

   <b>INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b>
       List of public compile definitions requirements for a library.

       Targets  may  populate  this  property to publish the compile definitions required to compile against the
       headers for the target.  The <u>target_compile_definitions()</u> command populates  this  property  with  values
       given to the <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b> keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

       When  target dependencies are specified using <u>target_link_libraries()</u>, CMake will read this property from
       all target dependencies to determine the build properties of the consumer.

       Contents of <b>INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b> may use "generator expressions" with the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See
       the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  available  expressions.   See  the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u>
       -manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       List of public compile features requirements for a library.

       Targets may populate this property to publish the  compile  features  required  to  compile  against  the
       headers  for the target.  The <u>target_compile_features()</u> command populates this property with values given
       to the <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b> keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

       When target dependencies are specified using <u>target_link_libraries()</u>, CMake will read this property  from
       all target dependencies to determine the build properties of the consumer.

       Contents  of  <b>INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES</b> may use "generator expressions" with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See the

   <b>INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS</b>
       List of public compile options requirements for a library.

       Targets may populate this property to publish the compile options required to compile against the headers
       for the target.  The <u>target_compile_options()</u> command populates this property with values  given  to  the
       <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b> keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

       When  target dependencies are specified using <u>target_link_libraries()</u>, CMake will read this property from

       for more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>INTERFACE_CXX_MODULE_SETS</b>
       Added in version 3.28.

       Read-only list of the target's <b>PUBLIC</b> C++ module sets (i.e. all file sets  with  the  type  <b>CXX_MODULES</b>).
       Files  listed  in  these  C++  module  sets  can  be  installed  with  <u>install(TARGETS)</u> and exported with
       <u>install(EXPORT)</u> and <u>export()</u>.

       C++ module sets may be defined using the <u>target_sources()</u> command <b>FILE_SET</b> option with type <b>CXX_MODULES</b>.

       See also <u>CXX_MODULE_SETS</u>.

   <b>INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS</b>
       Added in version 3.23.

       Read-only list of the target's <b>INTERFACE</b> and <b>PUBLIC</b> header sets  (i.e.   all  file  sets  with  the  type
       <b>HEADERS</b>).  Files  listed  in  these  header sets can be installed with <u>install(TARGETS)</u> and exported with
       <u>install(EXPORT)</u> and <u>export()</u>.

       Header sets may be defined using the <u>target_sources()</u> command <b>FILE_SET</b> option with type <b>HEADERS</b>.

       See also <u>HEADER_SETS</u>.

   <b>INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS_TO_VERIFY</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       Used to specify which <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b> header sets of a target should be verified.

       This  property  contains  a  semicolon-separated  list  of  header  sets  which  should  be  verified  if
       <u>VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS</u>  is  set to <b>TRUE</b>. If the list is empty, all <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b> header sets
       are verified. (If the project does not want  to  verify  any  header  sets  on  the  target,  simply  set
       <u>VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS</u> to <b>FALSE</b>.)

   <b>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b>
       List of public include directories requirements for a library.

       Targets  may  populate  this  property to publish the include directories required to compile against the
       headers for the target.  The <u>target_include_directories()</u> command populates  this  property  with  values
       given to the <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b> keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

       When  target dependencies are specified using <u>target_link_libraries()</u>, CMake will read this property from
       all target dependencies to determine the build properties of the consumer.

       Contents of <b>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b> may use "generator expressions" with the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See
       the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  available  expressions.   See  the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u>
       -manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

       Include directories usage requirements commonly differ between the build-tree and the install-tree.   The
       <b>BUILD_INTERFACE</b>  and  <b>INSTALL_INTERFACE</b>  generator  expressions  can  be  used to describe separate usage
       requirements based on the usage location.   Relative  paths  are  allowed  within  the  <b>INSTALL_INTERFACE</b>
       expression and are interpreted relative to the installation prefix.  For example:

          target_include_directories(mylib INTERFACE
            $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/mylib&gt;
            $&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/mylib&gt;  # &lt;prefix&gt;/include/mylib
          )

   <b>Creating</b> <b>Relocatable</b> <b>Packages</b>
       Note that it is not advisable to populate the <u>INSTALL_INTERFACE</u> of the <b>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b> of a
       target  with  absolute  paths  to  the  include  directories  of dependencies.  That would hard-code into
       installed packages the include directory paths for dependencies <b>as</b> <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>the</b>  <b>package</b>  <b>was</b>
       <b>made</b> <b>on</b>.

       The  <u>INSTALL_INTERFACE</u>  of the <b>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b> is only suitable for specifying the required
       include directories for headers provided with the target itself, not those  provided  by  the  transitive
       dependencies   listed  in  its  <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>  target  property.   Those  dependencies  should
       themselves be targets that specify their own header locations in <b>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b>.

       See the <u>Creating</u>  <u>Relocatable</u>  <u>Packages</u>  section  of  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-packages.7.html">cmake-packages</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  discussion  of
       additional  care  that  must  be  taken  when  specifying  usage requirements while creating packages for
       redistribution.

   <b>INTERFACE_LINK_DEPENDS</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       Additional public interface files on which a target binary depends for linking.

       This property is supported only by <u>Ninja</u> and <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u>.  It is intended to specify dependencies
       on "linker scripts" for custom Makefile link rules.

       When target dependencies are specified using <u>target_link_libraries()</u>, CMake will read this property  from
       all target dependencies to determine the build properties of the consumer.

       Contents  of  <b>INTERFACE_LINK_DEPENDS</b>  may  use  "generator  expressions" with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u>  -manual
       for more on defining buildsystem properties.

       Link  dependency  files  usage  requirements commonly differ between the build-tree and the install-tree.
       The <b>BUILD_INTERFACE</b> and <b>INSTALL_INTERFACE</b> generator expressions can be used to  describe  separate  usage
       requirements  based  on  the  usage  location.   Relative  paths are allowed within the <b>INSTALL_INTERFACE</b>
       expression and are interpreted relative to the installation prefix.  For example:

          set_property(TARGET mylib PROPERTY INTERFACE_LINK_DEPENDS
            $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/mylinkscript&gt;
            $&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:mylinkscript&gt;  # &lt;prefix&gt;/mylinkscript
          )

   <b>INTERFACE_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       List of public link directories requirements for a library.

       Targets may populate this property to publish the  link  directories  required  to  compile  against  the
       headers  for the target.  The <u>target_link_directories()</u> command populates this property with values given
       to the <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b> keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

       When target dependencies are specified using <u>target_link_libraries()</u>, CMake will read this property  from
       all target dependencies to determine the build properties of the consumer.

       for more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</b>
       List public interface libraries for a library.

       This  property contains the list of transitive link dependencies.  When the target is linked into another
       target using the <u>target_link_libraries()</u> command,  the  libraries  listed  (and  recursively  their  link
       interface  libraries)  will  be  provided  to  the other target also.  This property is overridden by the
       <u>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</u> or <u>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> property if policy <u>CMP0022</u> is <b>OLD</b> or unset.

       The value of this property is used by the generators when constructing the  link  rule  for  a  dependent
       target.   A dependent target's direct link dependencies, specified by its <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u> target property,
       are linked  first,  followed  by  indirect  dependencies  from  the  transitive  closure  of  the  direct
       dependencies' <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</b> properties.  See policy <u>CMP0022</u>.

       Contents  of  <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</b>  may  use "generator expressions" with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          A call to <u>target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt;</u> <u>...)</u> may update this property on <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>.  If  <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>  was
          not  created  in the same directory as the call then <u>target_link_libraries()</u> will wrap each entry with
          the form <b>::@(directory-id);...;::@</b>, where the <b>::@</b> is literal and the  <b>(directory-id)</b>  is  unspecified.
          This tells the generators that the named libraries must be looked up in the scope of the caller rather
          than  in  the  scope in which the <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> was created.  Valid directory ids are stripped on export by
          the <u>install(EXPORT)</u> and <u>export()</u> commands.

       <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</b> adds transitive link dependencies for a target's dependents.   In  advanced  use
       cases,   one   may   update  the  direct  link  dependencies  of  a  target's  dependents  by  using  the
       <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</u> and <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</u> target properties.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>Relocatable</b> <b>Packages</b>
       Note that it is not advisable to populate the <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</b> of a target with absolute paths to
       dependencies.  That would hard-code into installed packages the library file paths  for  dependencies  <b>as</b>
       <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>the</b> <b>package</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b>.

       See  the  <u>Creating</u>  <u>Relocatable</u>  <u>Packages</u>  section  of  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-packages.7.html">cmake-packages</a>(7)</u>  manual  for discussion of
       additional care that must be taken  when  specifying  usage  requirements  while  creating  packages  for
       redistribution.

   <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       List of libraries that consumers of this library should treat as direct link dependencies.

       This  target  property  may  be  set  to  <u>include</u>  items in a dependent target's final set of direct link
       dependencies.  See the <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</u> target property to exclude items.

       The initial set of a dependent target's direct link  dependencies  is  specified  by  its  <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u>
       target  property.   Indirect link dependencies are specified by the transitive closure of the direct link
       dependencies' <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> properties.  Any link dependency  may  specify  additional  direct
       link  dependencies  using  the  <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</b>  target property.  The set of direct link
       dependencies    is    then    filtered    to    exclude    items    named     by     any     dependency's
       <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</u> target property.

       The value of <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The  <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</b>  target  property  is  intended  for  advanced  use cases such as
          injection of static plugins into a consuming executable.  It should not be used as  a  substitute  for
          organizing normal calls to <u>target_link_libraries()</u>.

   <b>Direct</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Dependencies</b> <b>as</b> <b>Usage</b> <b>Requirements</b>
       The  <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</b>  and  <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</b>  target properties are
       <u>usage</u> <u>requirements</u>.  Their effects propagate to dependent targets transitively, and can therefore  affect
       the  direct  link  dependencies of every target in a chain of dependent libraries.  Whenever some library
       target <b>X</b> links to another library  target  <b>Y</b>  whose  direct  or  transitive  usage  requirements  contain
       <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</b> or <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</b>, the properties may affect <b>X</b>'s
       list of direct link dependencies:

       • If  <b>X</b>  is  a  shared  library  or  executable, its dependencies are linked.  They also affect the usage
         requirements with which <b>X</b>'s sources are compiled.

       • If <b>X</b> is a static library or object library, it does not actually link,  so  its  dependencies  at  most
         affect the usage requirements with which <b>X</b>'s sources are compiled.

       The properties may also affect the list of direct link dependencies on <b>X</b>'s dependents:

       • If <b>X</b> links <b>Y</b> publicly:

            target_link_libraries(X PUBLIC Y)

         then   <b>Y</b>   is   placed   in   <b>X</b>'s   <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>,  so  <b>Y</b>'s  usage  requirements,  including
         <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</b>, <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</b>, and  the  usage  requirements
         declared by the direct link dependencies they add, are propagated to <b>X</b>'s dependents.

       • If <b>X</b> is a static library or object library, and links <b>Y</b> privately:

            target_link_libraries(X PRIVATE Y)

         then  <b>$&lt;LINK_ONLY:Y&gt;</b>  is  placed  in <b>X</b>'s <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>.  <b>Y</b>'s linking requirements, including
         <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</b>,  <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</b>,  and  the  transitive   link
         dependencies  declared  by  the  direct  link  dependencies they add, are propagated to <b>X</b>'s dependents.
         However, <b>Y</b>'s non-linking usage requirements are blocked by the <u>LINK_ONLY</u> generator expression, and  are
         not propagated to <b>X</b>'s dependents.

       • If <b>X</b> is a shared library or executable, and links <b>Y</b> privately:

            target_link_libraries(X PRIVATE Y)

         then   <b>Y</b>   is   not   placed   in   <b>X</b>'s  <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>,  so  <b>Y</b>'s  usage  requirements,  even
         <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</b> and <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</b>, are not propagated to  <b>X</b>'s
         dependents.

       • In   all   cases,   the   content   of   <b>X</b>'s   <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>   is   not   affected   by  <b>Y</b>'s
         <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</b> or <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</b>.

       One may limit the effects of <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</b> and  <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</b>
       to  a  subset  of  dependent  targets by using the <u>TARGET_PROPERTY</u> generator expression.  For example, to
       limit the effects to executable targets, use an entry of the form:

          "$&lt;$&lt;STREQUAL:$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:TYPE&gt;,EXECUTABLE&gt;:...&gt;"

       Similarly, to limit the effects to specific targets, use an entry of the form:

          "$&lt;$&lt;BOOL:$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:USE_IT&gt;&gt;:...&gt;"

       This entry will only affect targets that set their <b>USE_IT</b> target property to a true value.

   <b>Direct</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Dependency</b> <b>Ordering</b>
       The list of direct link dependencies for a target is  computed  from  an  initial  ordered  list  in  its
       <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u>  target  property.  For each item, additional direct link dependencies are discovered from
       its direct and transitive <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</b> usage requirements.  Each  discovered  item  is
       injected  before  the item that specified it.  However, a discovered item is added at most once, and only
       if it did not appear anywhere in the initial list.  This gives <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u> control  over  ordering  of
       those direct link dependencies that it explicitly specifies.

       Once   all   direct   link   dependencies   have   been   collected,   items   named   by  all  of  their
       <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</u> usage requirements are removed from the final  list.   This  does
       not affect the order of the items that remain.

   <b>Example:</b> <b>Static</b> <b>Plugins</b>
       Consider  a  static  library  <b>Foo</b>  that  provides  a  static  plugin  <b>FooPlugin</b>  to consuming application
       executables, where the implementation of the plugin depends on <b>Foo</b> and other things.  In this  case,  the
       application  should  link  to <b>FooPlugin</b> directly, before <b>Foo</b>.  However, the application author only knows
       about <b>Foo</b>.  We can express this as follows:

          # Core library used by other components.
          add_library(Core STATIC core.cpp)

          # Foo is a static library for use by applications.
          # Implementation of Foo depends on Core.
          add_library(Foo STATIC foo.cpp foo_plugin_helper.cpp)
          target_link_libraries(Foo PRIVATE Core)

          # Extra parts of Foo for use by its static plugins.
          # Implementation of Foo's extra parts depends on both Core and Foo.
          add_library(FooExtras STATIC foo_extras.cpp)
          target_link_libraries(FooExtras PRIVATE Core Foo)

          # The Foo library has an associated static plugin
          # that should be linked into the final executable.
          # Implementation of the plugin depends on Core, Foo, and FooExtras.
          add_library(FooPlugin STATIC foo_plugin.cpp)
          target_link_libraries(FooPlugin PRIVATE Core Foo FooExtras)

          # An app that links Foo should link Foo's plugin directly.
          set_property(TARGET Foo PROPERTY INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT FooPlugin)

          # An app does not need to link Foo directly because the plugin links it.
          set_property(TARGET Foo PROPERTY INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE Foo)

       An application <b>app</b> only needs to specify that it links to <b>Foo</b>:

          add_executable(app main.cpp)
          target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE Foo)

       The <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</b> target property on <b>Foo</b> tells CMake to pretend  that  <b>app</b>  also  links
       directly to <b>FooPlugin</b>.  The <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</b> target property on <b>Foo</b> tells CMake to
       pretend that <b>app</b> did <u>not</u> link directly to <b>Foo</b>.  Instead, <b>Foo</b> will be linked as a dependency of <b>FooPlugin</b>.
       The final link line for <b>app</b> will link the libraries in the following order:

       • <b>FooPlugin</b> as a direct link dependency of <b>app</b> (via <b>Foo</b>'s usage requirements).

       • <b>FooExtras</b> as a dependency of <b>FooPlugin</b>.

       • <b>Foo</b> as a dependency of <b>FooPlugin</b> and <b>FooExtras</b>.

       • <b>Core</b> as a dependency of <b>FooPlugin</b>, <b>FooExtras</b>, and <b>Foo</b>.

       Note that without the <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</b> target property, <b>Foo</b> would be linked twice:
       once as a direct dependency of <b>app</b>, and once as a dependency of <b>FooPlugin</b>.

   <b>Example:</b> <b>Opt-In</b> <b>Static</b> <b>Plugins</b>
       In  the  above <u>Example:</u> <u>Static</u> <u>Plugins</u>, the <b>app</b> executable specifies that it links directly to <b>Foo</b>.  In a
       real application, there might be an intermediate library:

          add_library(app_impl STATIC app_impl.cpp)
          target_link_libraries(app_impl PRIVATE Foo)

          add_executable(app main.cpp)
          target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE app_impl)

       In     this     case     we     do     not     want     <b>Foo</b>'s     <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</b>     and
       <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</b>  target properties to affect the direct dependencies of <b>app_impl</b>.
       To avoid this, we can revise the property values to make their effects opt-in:

          # An app that links Foo should link Foo's plugin directly.
          set_property(TARGET Foo PROPERTY INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT
            "$&lt;$&lt;BOOL:$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:FOO_STATIC_PLUGINS&gt;&gt;:FooPlugin&gt;"
          )

          # An app does not need to link Foo directly because the plugin links it.
          set_property(TARGET Foo PROPERTY INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE
            "$&lt;$&lt;BOOL:$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:FOO_STATIC_PLUGINS&gt;&gt;:Foo&gt;"
          )

       Now, the <b>app</b> executable can opt-in to get <b>Foo</b>'s plugin(s):

          set_property(TARGET app PROPERTY FOO_STATIC_PLUGINS 1)

       The final link line for <b>app</b> will now link the libraries in the following order:

       • <b>FooPlugin</b> as a direct link dependency of <b>app</b> (via <b>Foo</b>'s usage requirements).

       • <b>app_impl</b> as a direct link dependency of <b>app</b>.

       • <b>FooExtras</b> as a dependency of <b>FooPlugin</b>.

       • <b>Foo</b> as a dependency of <b>app_impl</b>, <b>FooPlugin</b>, and <b>FooExtras</b>.

       • <b>Core</b> as a dependency of <b>FooPlugin</b>, <b>FooExtras</b>, and <b>Foo</b>.

   <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       List of libraries that consumers of this library should <u>not</u> treat as direct link dependencies.

       This target property may be set to <u>exclude</u> items from a dependent  target's  final  set  of  direct  link
       dependencies.   This  property  is processed after the <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</u> target property of
       all other dependencies of the dependent target, so exclusion from direct link dependence  takes  priority
       over inclusion.

       The  initial  set  of  a  dependent  target's direct link dependencies is specified by its <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u>
       target property.  Indirect link dependencies are specified by the transitive closure of the  direct  link
       dependencies'  <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>  properties.   Any  link dependency may specify additional direct
       link dependencies using the <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</u> target property.   The  set  of  direct  link
       dependencies     is     then     filtered    to    exclude    items    named    by    any    dependency's
       <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</b> target property.

       Excluding an item from a dependent target's direct link dependencies does not mean the  dependent  target
       won't  link  the  item.   The  item  may  still  be  linked  as  an  indirect  link  dependency  via  the
       <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> property on other dependencies.

       The value of <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The <b>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</b> target property is intended for advanced use cases such as
          injection of static plugins into a consuming executable.  It should not be used as  a  substitute  for
          organizing normal calls to <u>target_link_libraries()</u>.

       See the <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</u> target property documentation for more details and examples.

   <b>INTERFACE_LINK_OPTIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       List of public link options requirements for a library.

       Targets  may  populate  this property to publish the link options required to compile against the headers
       for the target.  The <u>target_link_options()</u> command populates this  property  with  values  given  to  the
       <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b> keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

       When  target dependencies are specified using <u>target_link_libraries()</u>, CMake will read this property from
       all target dependencies to determine the build properties of the consumer.

       Contents of <b>INTERFACE_LINK_OPTIONS</b> may use "generator expressions"  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See  the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> -manual
       for more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</b>
       Whether consumers need to create a position-independent target

       The <b>INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</b> property informs consumers of this target whether they  must  set
       their   <u>POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</u>   property   to   <b>ON</b>.   If  this  property  is  set  to  <b>ON</b>,  then  the
       <u>POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</u> property on  all consumers will be set to <b>ON</b>. Similarly, if  this  property  is
       set  to  <b>OFF</b>,  then  the <u>POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</u> property on all consumers will be set to <b>OFF</b>.  If this
       property is undefined, then consumers will determine their <u>POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</u>  property  by  other
       means.   Consumers must ensure that the targets that they link to have a consistent requirement for their
       <b>INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</b> property.

       Contents of <b>INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</b> may use "generator expressions" with the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.

       manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>INTERFACE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       List of interface header files to precompile into consuming targets.

       Targets may populate this property to publish the header files for consuming targets to precompile.   The
       <u>target_precompile_headers()</u> command populates this property with values given to the <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b>
       keywords.    Projects   may   also   get   and   set  the  property  directly.   See  the  discussion  in
       <u>target_precompile_headers()</u> for guidance on appropriate use of this property for  installed  or  exported
       targets.

       Contents of <b>INTERFACE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</b> may use "generator expressions" with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>INTERFACE_SOURCES</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       List of interface sources to compile into consuming targets.

       Targets  may  populate  this  property  to  publish  the  sources  for consuming targets to compile.  The
       <u>target_sources()</u> command populates this property with values given to the <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b>  keywords.
       Projects may also get and set the property directly.

       When  target dependencies are specified using <u>target_link_libraries()</u>, CMake will read this property from
       all target dependencies to determine the sources of the consumer.

       Contents of  <b>INTERFACE_SOURCES</b>  may  use  "generator  expressions"  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See  the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b>
       List of public system include directories for a library.

       Targets  may  populate this property to publish the include directories which contain system headers, and
       therefore should not result in compiler warnings.  Additionally, system include directories are  searched
       after normal include directories regardless of the order specified.

       When  the  <u>target_include_directories()</u>  command  is given the <b>SYSTEM</b> keyword, it populates this property
       with values provided after the <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b> keywords.

       Projects may also get and set the property directly, but must be aware that adding  directories  to  this
       property  does  not  make those directories used during compilation.  Adding directories to this property
       marks directories as system directories which otherwise would be used in a non-system manner.   This  can
       appear  similar  to  duplication,  so prefer the high-level <u>target_include_directories()</u> command with the
       <b>SYSTEM</b> keyword and avoid setting the property directly.

       When target dependencies are specified using <u>target_link_libraries()</u>, CMake will read this property  from
       all target dependencies to mark the same include directories as containing system headers.

       Contents  of <b>INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b> may use "generator expressions" with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.
       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.   See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u>
       manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION</b>
       Enable interprocedural optimization for a target.

       If  set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are known <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>supported</u> by the compiler.
       Depending on value of policy  <u>CMP0069</u>,  the  error  will  be  reported  or  ignored,  if  interprocedural
       optimization is enabled but not supported.

       This  property  is  initialized  by  the  <u>CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION</u> variable if it is set when a
       target is created.

       There  is  also  the  per-configuration  <u>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>  target  property,   which
       overrides <u>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION</u> if it is set.

   <b>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a target.

       This is a per-configuration version of <u>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION</u>.  If set, this property overrides the
       generic property for the named configuration.

       This  property  is  initialized  by the <u>CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> variable if it is set
       when a target is created.

   <b>ISPC_HEADER_DIRECTORY</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       Specify relative output directory for ISPC headers provided by the target.

       If the target contains ISPC source files, this specifies the directory in  which  the  generated  headers
       will  be  placed.  Relative paths are treated with respect to the value of <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u>. When
       this property is not set, the headers will be placed a generator defined build directory. If the variable
       <u>CMAKE_ISPC_HEADER_DIRECTORY</u> is set when a target  is  created  its  value  is  used  to  initialize  this
       property.

   <b>ISPC_HEADER_SUFFIX</b>
       Added in version 3.19.2.

       Specify output suffix to be used for ISPC generated headers provided by the target.

       This  property  is  initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_ISPC_HEADER_SUFFIX</u> variable if it is set when a
       target  is created.

       If the target contains ISPC source files, this specifies the header suffix to be used for  the  generated
       headers.

       The default value is <b>_ispc.h</b>.

   <b>ISPC_INSTRUCTION_SETS</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       List of instruction set architectures to generate code for.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_ISPC_INSTRUCTION_SETS</u> variable if it is set when a
       target is created.

       The  <b>ISPC_INSTRUCTION_SETS</b>  target property must be used when generating for multiple instruction sets so
       that CMake can track what object files will be generated.

   <b>Examples</b>
          set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY ISPC_INSTRUCTION_SETS avx2-i32x4 avx512skx-i32x835)

       Generates code for avx2 and avx512skx target architectures.

   <b>JOB_POOL_COMPILE</b>
       Ninja only: Pool used for compiling.

       The number of parallel compile processes could be limited by defining pools  with  the  global  <u>JOB_POOLS</u>
       property and then specifying here the pool name.

       For instance:

          set_property(TARGET myexe PROPERTY JOB_POOL_COMPILE ten_jobs)

       This property is initialized by the value of <u>CMAKE_JOB_POOL_COMPILE</u>.

   <b>JOB_POOL_LINK</b>
       Ninja only: Pool used for linking.

       The  number  of  parallel  link  processes  could  be limited by defining pools with the global <u>JOB_POOLS</u>
       property and then specifying here the pool name.

       For instance:

          set_property(TARGET myexe PROPERTY JOB_POOL_LINK two_jobs)

       This property is initialized by the value of <u>CMAKE_JOB_POOL_LINK</u>.

   <b>JOB_POOL_PRECOMPILE_HEADER</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       Ninja only: Pool used for generating pre-compiled headers.

       The number of parallel compile processes could be limited by defining pools  with  the  global  <u>JOB_POOLS</u>
       property and then specifying here the pool name.

       For instance:

          set_property(TARGET myexe PROPERTY JOB_POOL_PRECOMPILE_HEADER two_jobs)

       This property is initialized by the value of <u>CMAKE_JOB_POOL_PRECOMPILE_HEADER</u>.

       If  neither <b>JOB_POOL_PRECOMPILE_HEADER</b> nor <u>CMAKE_JOB_POOL_PRECOMPILE_HEADER</u> are set then <u>JOB_POOL_COMPILE</u>
       will be used for this task.

   <b>LABELS</b>
       Specify a list of text labels associated with a target.

       Target label semantics are currently unspecified.

   <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_CLANG_TIDY</b>
       Added in version 3.6.

       This property is implemented only when <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> is <b>C</b>, <b>CXX</b>, <b>OBJC</b> or <b>OBJCXX</b>.

       Specify a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> containing a command line  for  the  <b>clang-tidy</b>  tool.   The  <u>Makefile</u>
       <u>Generators</u> and the <u>Ninja</u> generator will run this tool along with the compiler and report a warning if the
       tool reports any problems.

       The  specified  <b>clang-tidy</b>  command  line will be invoked with additional arguments specifying the source
       file and, after <b>--</b>, the full compiler command line.

       Changed in version 3.25: If the specified <b>clang-tidy</b> command line includes the  <b>-p</b>  option,  it  will  be
       invoked  without  <b>--</b>  and the full compiler command line.  <b>clang-tidy</b> will look up the source file in the
       specified compiler commands database.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CLANG_TIDY</u> variable if it  is  set  when  a
       target is created.

       Added in version 3.27: This property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       Added  in  version  3.27:  <u>SKIP_LINTING</u>  can  be  set on individual source files to exclude them from the
       linting    tools    defined    by     <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPLINT</u>,     <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_CLANG_TIDY</b>,     <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPCHECK</u>,     and
       <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE</u>.   When <u>SKIP_LINTING</u> is set to true on a source file, those tools will not be
       run on that specific file.

   <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_CLANG_TIDY_EXPORT_FIXES_DIR</b>
       Added in version 3.26.

       This property is implemented only when <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> is <b>C</b>, <b>CXX</b>, <b>OBJC</b> or <b>OBJCXX</b>, and  only  has  an  effect  when
       <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CLANG_TIDY</u> is set.

       Specify  a directory for the <b>clang-tidy</b> tool to put <b>.yaml</b> files containing its suggested changes in. This
       can be used for automated mass refactoring by <b>clang-tidy</b>. Each object file that gets compiled will have a
       corresponding  <b>.yaml</b>  file  in  this  directory.  After   the   build   is   completed,   you   can   run
       <b>clang-apply-replacements</b>  on  this  directory  to  simultaneously apply all suggested changes to the code
       base. If this property is not an absolute directory, it is assumed to be relative to the target's  binary
       directory.  This property should be preferred over adding an <b>--export-fixes</b> or <b>--fix</b> argument directly to
       the <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CLANG_TIDY</u> property.

       When this property is set, CMake takes ownership of the specified directory, and may create,  modify,  or
       delete  files  and  directories  within  the  directory at any time during configure or build time. Users
       should use a dedicated directory for  exporting  clang-tidy  fixes  to  avoid  having  files  deleted  or
       overwritten by CMake. Users should not create, modify, or delete files in this directory.

       This  property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CLANG_TIDY_EXPORT_FIXES_DIR</u> variable if it
       is set when a target is created.

   <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LAUNCHER</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       This property is implemented only when <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> is <b>C</b>, <b>CXX</b>, <b>Fortran</b>, <b>HIP</b>, <b>ISPC</b>, <b>OBJC</b>, <b>OBJCXX</b>, or <b>CUDA</b>.

       Specify a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> containing a command line for a compiler launching tool. The  <u>Makefile</u>
       <u>Generators</u>  and  the  <u>Ninja</u>  generator  will run this tool and pass the compiler and its arguments to the
       tool. Some example tools are distcc and ccache.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LAUNCHER</u> variable  if  it  is  set
       when a target is created.

       Added in version 3.25: The property value may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

   <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPCHECK</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       This property is supported only when <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> is <b>C</b> or <b>CXX</b>.

       Specify  a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> containing a command line for the <b>cppcheck</b> static analysis tool.  The
       <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> and the <u>Ninja</u> generator will run <b>cppcheck</b> along with  the  compiler  and  report  any
       problems.   If  the command-line specifies the exit code options to <b>cppcheck</b> then the build  will fail if
       the tool returns non-zero.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPCHECK</u> variable  if  it  is  set  when  a
       target is created.

       Added in version 3.27: This property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       Added  in  version  3.27:  <u>SKIP_LINTING</u>  can  be  set on individual source files to exclude them from the
       linting    tools    defined    by     <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPLINT</u>,     <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CLANG_TIDY</u>,     <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPCHECK</b>,     and
       <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE</u>.   When <u>SKIP_LINTING</u> is set to true on a source file, those tools will not be
       run on that specific file.

   <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPLINT</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       This property is supported only when <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> is <b>C</b> or <b>CXX</b>.

       Specify a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> containing a command line for the <b>cpplint</b> style checker.  The <u>Makefile</u>
       <u>Generators</u> and the <u>Ninja</u> generator will run <b>cpplint</b> along with the compiler and report any problems.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPLINT</u> variable if it is set when a target
       is created.

       Added in version 3.27: This property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       Added in version 3.27: <u>SKIP_LINTING</u> can be set on individual  source  files  to  exclude  them  from  the
       linting     tools     defined     by     <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPLINT</b>,    <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CLANG_TIDY</u>,    <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPCHECK</u>,    and

       run on that specific file.

   <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_EXTENSIONS</b>
       The variations are:

       • <u>C_EXTENSIONS</u>

       • <u>CXX_EXTENSIONS</u>

       • <u>CUDA_EXTENSIONS</u>

       • <u>HIP_EXTENSIONS</u>

       • <u>OBJC_EXTENSIONS</u>

       • <u>OBJCXX_EXTENSIONS</u>

       These properties specify whether compiler-specific extensions are requested.

       These properties are initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_EXTENSIONS</u> variable if it is set when a
       target is created and otherwise by the value of <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT</u> (see <u>CMP0128</u>).

       For  supported  CMake  versions  see  the  respective  pages.   To control language standard versions see

   <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE</b>
       Added in version 3.3.

       This property is implemented only when <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> is <b>C</b> or <b>CXX</b>.

       Specify  a  <u>semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  containing  a command line for the <b>include-what-you-use</b> tool.  The
       <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> and the <u>Ninja</u> generator will run this tool along  with  the  compiler  and  report  a
       warning if the tool reports any problems.

       This  property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE</u> variable if it is set
       when a target is created.

       Added in version 3.27: This property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       Added in version 3.27: <u>SKIP_LINTING</u> can be set on individual  source  files  to  exclude  them  from  the
       linting     tools     defined     by     <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPLINT</u>,    <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CLANG_TIDY</u>,    <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPCHECK</u>,    and
       <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE</b>.  When <u>SKIP_LINTING</u> is set to true on a source file, those tools will not  be
       run on that specific file.

   <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_LAUNCHER</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       This property is implemented only when <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> is <b>C</b>, <b>CXX</b>, <b>OBJC</b>, or <b>OBJCXX</b>

       Specify  a  <u>semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u> containing a command line for a linker launching tool. The <u>Makefile</u>
       <u>Generators</u> and the <u>Ninja</u> generator will run this tool and pass the linker and its arguments to the  tool.
       This is useful for tools such as static analyzers.

       This  property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_LAUNCHER</u> variable if it is set when
       a target is created.

       Added in version 3.27: The property value may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

   <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</b>
       The variations are:

       • <u>C_STANDARD</u>

       • <u>CXX_STANDARD</u>

       • <u>CUDA_STANDARD</u>

       • <u>HIP_STANDARD</u>

       • <u>OBJC_STANDARD</u>

       • <u>OBJCXX_STANDARD</u>

       These properties specify language standard versions  which  are  requested.  When  a  newer  standard  is
       specified than is supported by the compiler, then it will fallback to the latest supported standard. This
       "decay" behavior may be controlled with the <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u> target property.

       Note  that  the  actual  language  standard  used  may  be higher than that specified by <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</b>,
       regardless of the value of <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>.  In particular, <u>usage</u> <u>requirements</u>  or  the  use  of
       <u>compile</u> <u>features</u> can raise the required language standard above what <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</b> specifies.

       These  properties  are initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</u> variable if it is set when a
       target is created.

       For supported values  and  CMake  versions  see  the  respective  pages.   To  control  compiler-specific
       extensions see <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_EXTENSIONS</u>.

       See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  information on compile features and a list of supported
       compilers.

   <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_REQUIRED</b>
       The variations are:

       • <u>C_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       • <u>CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       • <u>CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       • <u>HIP_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       • <u>OBJC_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       • <u>OBJCXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       These properties specify whether the value of <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</u> is a requirement.  When false or unset, the
       <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</u> target property is treated as optional and may "decay" to  a  previous  standard  if  the
       requested  standard  is  not  available.   When  <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_REQUIRED</b> is set to true, <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</u>
       becomes a hard requirement and a fatal error will be issued if that requirement cannot be met.

       Note that the actual language standard used  may  be  higher  than  that  specified  by  <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</u>,
       regardless  of  the  value  of <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_REQUIRED</b>.  In particular, <u>usage</u> <u>requirements</u> or the use of
       <u>compile</u> <u>features</u> can raise the required language standard above what <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</u> specifies.

       These properties are initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u> variable if it is set
       when a target is created.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u> manual for information on compile features  and  a  list  of  supported
       compilers.

   <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET</b>
       Value for symbol visibility compile flags

       The <b>&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET</b> property determines the value passed in a visibility related compile option,
       such  as  <b>-fvisibility=</b> for <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.  This property affects compilation in sources of all types of targets
       (subject to policy <u>CMP0063</u>).

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET</u> variable  if  it  is  set
       when a target is created.

   <b>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</b>
       Output directory in which to build <u>LIBRARY</u> target files.

       This  property  specifies  the  directory  into which library target files should be built.  The property
       value may use  <u>generator</u>  <u>expressions</u>.   Multi-configuration  generators  (<u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>,  <u>Xcode</u>,  <u>Ninja</u>
       <u>Multi-Config</u>)  append  a  per-configuration  subdirectory  to  the specified directory unless a generator
       expression is used.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u> variable  if  it  is  set
       when a target is created.

       See also the <u>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> target property.

   <b>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration output directory for <u>LIBRARY</u> target files.

       This   is   a   per-configuration   version   of   the   <u>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u>  target  property,  but
       multi-configuration generators (<u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u>,  <u>Xcode</u>)  do  NOT  append  a  per-configuration
       subdirectory   to   the  specified  directory.   This  property  is  initialized  by  the  value  of  the
       <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> variable if it is set when a target is created.

       Contents of <b>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

   <b>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME</b>
       Output name for <u>LIBRARY</u> target files.

       This property  specifies  the  base  name  for  library  target  files.   It  overrides  <u>OUTPUT_NAME</u>  and
       <u>OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> properties.

       See also the <u>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> target property.

   <b>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration output name for <u>LIBRARY</u> target files.

       This is the configuration-specific version of the <u>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME</u> target property.

   <b>LINK_DEPENDS</b>
       Additional files on which a target binary depends for linking.

       Specifies  a  semicolon-separated  list  of  full-paths  to  files on which the link rule for this target
       depends.  The target binary will be linked if any of the named files is newer than it.

       This property is supported only by <u>Ninja</u> and <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u>.  It is intended to specify dependencies
       on "linker scripts" for custom Makefile link rules.

       Contents  of  <b>LINK_DEPENDS</b>  may  use  "generator  expressions"  with  the   syntax   <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.    See   the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED</b>
       Do not depend on linked shared library files.

       Set  this  property  to  true  to  tell CMake generators not to add file-level dependencies on the shared
       library files linked by this target.  Modification to the shared libraries  will  not  be  sufficient  to
       re-link  this  target.   Logical  target-level  dependencies  will  not  be affected so the linked shared
       libraries will still be brought up to date before this target is built.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED</u> variable if it is set  when
       a target is created.

   <b>LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       List of directories to use for the link step of shared library, module and executable targets.

       This  property  holds a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of directories specified so far for its target.  Use the
       <u>target_link_directories()</u> command to append more search directories.

       This property is initialized by the <u>LINK_DIRECTORIES</u> directory property when a target is created, and  is
       used by the generators to set the search directories for the linker.

       Contents  of  <b>LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>  may  use  "generator  expressions"  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See  the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>LINK_FLAGS</b>
       Additional flags to use when linking this target if it  is  a  shared  library,  module  library,  or  an
       executable. Static libraries need to use <u>STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS</u> or <u>STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS</u> properties.

       The  <b>LINK_FLAGS</b>  property,  managed  as  a  string,  can be used to add extra flags to the link step of a
       target.  <u>LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> will add  to  the  configuration  <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>,  for  example,  <b>DEBUG</b>,  <b>RELEASE</b>,
       <b>MINSIZEREL</b>, <b>RELWITHDEBINFO</b>, ...

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property has been superseded by <u>LINK_OPTIONS</u> property.

   <b>LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration linker flags for a <b>SHARED</b> library, <b>MODULE</b> or <b>EXECUTABLE</b> target.

       This is the configuration-specific version of <u>LINK_FLAGS</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property has been superseded by <u>LINK_OPTIONS</u> property.

   <b>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</b>
       List public interface libraries for a shared library or executable.

       By default linking to a shared library target transitively links to targets with which the library itself
       was  linked.   For  an  executable  with  exports  (see  the  <u>ENABLE_EXPORTS</u>  target property) no default
       transitive link dependencies are used.  This property replaces the default transitive  link  dependencies
       with  an  explicit list.  When the target is linked into another target using the <u>target_link_libraries()</u>
       command, the libraries listed (and recursively their link interface libraries) will be  provided  to  the
       other  target  also.  If the list is empty then no transitive link dependencies will be incorporated when
       this target is linked into another target even if  the  default  set  is  non-empty.   This  property  is
       initialized  by  the  value  of the <u>CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</u> variable if it is set when a target is
       created.  This property is ignored for <b>STATIC</b> libraries.

       This property is overridden by the <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> property if policy <u>CMP0022</u> is <b>NEW</b>.

       This property is deprecated.  Use <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> instead.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>Relocatable</b> <b>Packages</b>
       Note that it is not advisable to populate the <b>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</b> of a target with absolute paths to

       <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>the</b> <b>package</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b>.

   <b>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration list of public interface libraries for a target.

       redistribution.

   <b>LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY</b>
       Repetition count for <b>STATIC</b> libraries with cyclic dependencies.

       When linking to a <b>STATIC</b> library target with cyclic dependencies the linker may need to  scan  more  than
       once  through the archives in the strongly connected component of the dependency graph.  CMake by default
       constructs the link line so that the linker will  scan  through  the  component  at  least  twice.   This
       property  specifies the minimum number of scans if it is larger than the default.  CMake uses the largest
       value specified by any target in a component.

   <b>LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration repetition count for cycles of <b>STATIC</b> libraries.

       This is the  configuration-specific  version  of  <u>LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY</u>.   If  set,  this  property
       completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

   <b>LINK_LIBRARIES</b>
       List of direct link dependencies.

       This  property specifies the list of libraries or targets which will be used for linking.  In addition to
       accepting values from the <u>target_link_libraries()</u> command, values may be set directly on any target using
       the <u>set_property()</u> command.

       The value of this property is used by the generators to construct the link  rule  for  the  target.   The
       direct  link dependencies are linked first, followed by indirect dependencies from the transitive closure
       of the direct dependencies' <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> properties.  See policy <u>CMP0022</u>.

       Contents of <b>LINK_LIBRARIES</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  Policy <u>CMP0131</u>  affects
       the behavior of the <u>LINK_ONLY</u> generator expression for this property.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          A  call  to <u>target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt;</u> <u>...)</u> may update this property on <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>.  If <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> was
          not created in the same directory as the call then <u>target_link_libraries()</u> will wrap each  entry  with
          the  form  <b>::@(directory-id);...;::@</b>,  where the <b>::@</b> is literal and the <b>(directory-id)</b> is unspecified.
          This tells the generators that the named libraries must be looked up in the scope of the caller rather
          than in the scope in which the <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> was created.  Valid directory ids are stripped  on  export  by
          the <u>install(EXPORT)</u> and <u>export()</u> commands.

       In  advanced use cases, the list of direct link dependencies specified by this property may be updated by
       usage    requirements    from    dependencies.     See    the     <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</u>     and
       <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE</u> target properties.

       See  the <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARIES_STRATEGY</u> variable and corresponding <u>LINK_LIBRARIES_STRATEGY</u> target property
       for details on how CMake orders direct link dependencies on linker command lines.

   <b>LINK_LIBRARIES_ONLY_TARGETS</b>
       Added in version 3.23.

       Enforce that link items that can be target names are actually existing targets.

       Set this property to a true value to enable additional checks on the contents of the  <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u>  and
       <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>  target  properties, typically populated by <u>target_link_libraries()</u>.  Checks are
       also applied to libraries added to a target through the <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</u> properties of its
       dependencies.  CMake will verify that link items that  might  be  target  names  actually  name  existing
       targets.  An item is considered a possible target name if:

       • it does not contain a <b>/</b> or <b>\</b>, and

       • it does not start in <b>-</b>, and

       • (for historical reasons) it does not start in <b>$</b> or <b>`</b>.

       This  property  is  initialized  by  the  value  of the <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARIES_ONLY_TARGETS</u> variable when a
       non-imported target is created.  The property may be explicitly enabled on an imported  target  to  check
       its link interface.

       In the following example, CMake will halt with an error at configure time because <b>miLib</b> is not a target:

          set(CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARIES_ONLY_TARGETS ON)
          add_library(myLib STATIC myLib.c)
          add_executable(myExe myExe.c)
          target_link_libraries(myExe PRIVATE miLib) # typo for myLib

       In  order to link toolchain-provided libraries by name while still enforcing <b>LINK_LIBRARIES_ONLY_TARGETS</b>,
       use an <u>imported</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>Library</u> with the <u>IMPORTED_LIBNAME</u> target property:

          add_library(toolchain::m INTERFACE IMPORTED)
          set_property(TARGET toolchain::m PROPERTY IMPORTED_LIBNAME "m")
          target_link_libraries(myExe PRIVATE toolchain::m)

       See also policy <u>CMP0028</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          If <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> contains generator expressions, its actual list of link items  may  depend
          on  the  type and properties of the consuming target.  In such cases CMake may not always detect names
          of missing targets that only appear for specific consumers.  A future version of CMake  with  improved
          heuristics may start triggering errors on projects accepted by previous versions of CMake.

   <b>LINK_LIBRARIES_STRATEGY</b>
       Added in version 3.31.

       Specify  a  strategy  for  ordering  a  target's  direct link dependencies on linker command lines.  This
       property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARIES_STRATEGY</u> variable if it is  set  when  a
       target is created.

       CMake generates a target's link line using its <u>Target</u> <u>Link</u> <u>Properties</u>.  In particular, the <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u>
       target  property  records  the  target's  direct  link  dependencies,  typically  populated  by  calls to
       <u>target_link_libraries()</u>.  Indirect link dependencies are propagated from those entries of  <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u>
       that  name  library  targets  by  following  the  transitive  closure  of  their <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>
       properties.  CMake  supports  multiple  strategies  for  nominally  ordering  direct  and  indirect  link
       dependencies, which are then filtered for <u>Toolchain-Specific</u> <u>Behavior</u>.

       Consider this example for the strategies below:

          add_library(A STATIC ...)
          add_library(B STATIC ...)
          add_library(C STATIC ...)
          add_executable(main ...)
          target_link_libraries(B PRIVATE A)
          target_link_libraries(C PRIVATE A)
          target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE A B C)

       The supported strategies are:

       <b>REORDER_MINIMALLY</b>
              Entries  of  <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u>  always  appear  first  and  in  their  original order.  Indirect link
              dependencies not satisfied by the original entries may be reordered and de-duplicated with respect
              to one another, but are always appended after the original  entries.   This  may  result  in  less
              efficient  link  lines,  but  gives  projects control of ordering among independent entries.  Such
              control may be important when intermixing link flags with libraries, or  when  multiple  libraries
              provide a given symbol.

              This is the default.

              In  the  above  example, this strategy computes a link line for <b>main</b> by starting with its original
              entries <b>A</b> <b>B</b> <b>C</b>, and then appends another <b>A</b> to satisfy the dependencies  of  <b>B</b>  and  <b>C</b>  on  <b>A</b>.   The
              nominal order produced by this strategy is <b>A</b> <b>B</b> <b>C</b> <b>A</b>.

              Note  that  additional  filtering for <u>Toolchain-Specific</u> <u>Behavior</u> may de-duplicate <b>A</b> on the actual
              linker invocation in the generated build system, resulting in either <b>A</b> <b>B</b> <b>C</b> or <b>B</b> <b>C</b> <b>A</b>.

       <b>REORDER_FREELY</b>
              Entries of <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u> may be reordered,  de-duplicated,  and  intermixed  with  indirect  link
              dependencies.   This  may  result  in  more  efficient  link lines, but does not give projects any
              control of ordering among independent entries.

              In the above example, this strategy computes a link line for  <b>main</b>  by  re-ordering  its  original
              entries  <b>A</b>  <b>B</b>  <b>C</b>  to satisfy the dependencies of <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> on <b>A</b>.  The nominal order produced by this
              strategy is <b>B</b> <b>C</b> <b>A</b>.

   <b>Toolchain-Specific</b> <b>Behavior</b>
       After one of the above strategies produces a nominal order among direct and indirect  link  dependencies,
       the  actual  linker  invocation  in  the  generated  build  system  may  de-duplicate  entries  based  on
       platform-specific requirements and linker capabilities.  See policy <u>CMP0156</u>.

       For example, if the <b>REORDER_MINIMALLY</b> strategy produces <b>A</b> <b>B</b> <b>C</b> <b>A</b>, the actual link line may de-duplicate  <b>A</b>
       as follows:

       • If <b>A</b> is a static library and the linker re-scans automatically, the first occurrence is kept, resulting
         in <b>A</b> <b>B</b> <b>C</b>.  See policy <u>CMP0179</u>

       • If <b>A</b> is a shared library on Windows, the first occurrence is kept, resulting in <b>A</b> <b>B</b> <b>C</b>.

       • If <b>A</b> is a shared library on macOS or UNIX platforms, the last occurrence is kept, resulting in <b>B</b> <b>C</b> <b>A</b>.

   <b>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       Override  the  library  features associated with libraries from <u>LINK_LIBRARY</u> generator expressions.  This
       can be used to resolve incompatible library features that result from specifying different  features  for
       the same library in different <u>LINK_LIBRARY</u> generator expressions.

       This property supports overriding multiple libraries and features. It expects a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u>,
       where each list item has the following form:

          feature[,link-item]*

       For  each  comma-separated <b>link-item</b>, any existing library feature associated with it will be ignored for
       the target this property is set on.  The item will instead be  associated  with  the  specified  <b>feature</b>.
       Each  <b>link-item</b>  can  be  anything  that  would  be  accepted as part of a <b>library-list</b> in a <u>LINK_LIBRARY</u>
       generator expression.

          add_library(lib1 ...)
          add_library(lib2 ...)
          add_library(lib3 ...)

          target_link_libraries(lib1 PUBLIC "$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:feature1,external&gt;")
          target_link_libraries(lib2 PUBLIC "$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:feature2,lib1&gt;")
          target_link_libraries(lib3 PRIVATE lib1 lib2)

          # lib1 is associated with both feature2 and no feature. Without any override,
          # this would result in a fatal error at generation time for lib3.
          # Define an override to resolve the incompatible feature associations.
          set_property(TARGET lib3 PROPERTY LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE "feature2,lib1,external")

          # lib1 and external will now be associated with feature2 instead when linking lib3

       It is also possible to  override  any  feature  with  the  pre-defined  <b>DEFAULT</b>  library  feature.   This
       effectively discards any feature for that link item, for that target only (<b>lib3</b> in this example):

          # When linking lib3, discard any library feature for lib1, and use feature2 for external
          set_property(TARGET lib3 PROPERTY LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE
            "DEFAULT,lib1"
            "feature2,external"
          )

       The  above example also demonstrates how to specify different feature overrides for different link items.
       See the <u>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE_&lt;LIBRARY&gt;</u> target property for an  alternative  way  of  overriding  library
       features  for  individual  libraries, which may be simpler in some cases.  If both properties are defined
       and specify an override for the same link item,  <u>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE_&lt;LIBRARY&gt;</u>  takes  precedence  over
       <b>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE</b>.

       Contents of <b>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       For  more  information  about  library  features,  see  the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u> and
       <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u> variables.

   <b>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE_&lt;LIBRARY&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       Override the library feature associated with <b>&lt;LIBRARY&gt;</b> from <u>LINK_LIBRARY</u> generator expressions.  This can
       be used to resolve incompatible library features that  result  from  specifying  different  features  for
       <b>&lt;LIBRARY&gt;</b> in different <u>LINK_LIBRARY</u> generator expressions.

       When  set  on  a  target,  this  property  holds  a single library feature name, which will be applied to
       <b>&lt;LIBRARY&gt;</b> when linking that target.

          add_library(lib1 ...)
          add_library(lib2 ...)
          add_library(lib3 ...)

          target_link_libraries(lib1 PUBLIC "$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:feature1,external&gt;")
          target_link_libraries(lib2 PUBLIC "$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:feature2,lib1&gt;")
          target_link_libraries(lib3 PRIVATE lib1 lib2)

          # lib1 is associated with both feature2 and no feature. Without any override,
          # this would result in a fatal error at generation time for lib3.
          # Define an override to resolve the incompatible feature associations.
          set_property(TARGET lib3 PROPERTY LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE_lib1 feature2)

          # lib1 will now be associated with feature2 instead when linking lib3

       It is also possible to  override  any  feature  with  the  pre-defined  <b>DEFAULT</b>  library  feature.   This
       effectively discards any feature for that link item, for that target only (<b>lib3</b> in this example):

          # When linking lib3, discard any library feature for lib1
          set_property(TARGET lib3 PROPERTY LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE_lib1 DEFAULT)

       See  the  <u>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE</u> target property for an alternative way of overriding library features for
       multiple libraries at once.  If both properties are defined and specify an override  for  the  same  link
       item, <b>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE_&lt;LIBRARY&gt;</b> takes precedence over <u>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE</u>.

       Contents of <b>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE_&lt;LIBRARY&gt;</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       For  more  information  about  library  features,  see  the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u> and
       <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u> variables.

   <b>LINK_OPTIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       List of options to use for the link step of shared library, module and executable targets as well as  the
       device  link  step.  Targets  that  are  static  libraries  need to use the <u>STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS</u> target
       property.

       These options are used for both normal linking and device linking (see policy <u>CMP0105</u>). To  control  link
       options  for  normal  and device link steps, <u>$&lt;HOST_LINK&gt;</u> and <u>$&lt;DEVICE_LINK&gt;</u> generator expressions can be
       used.

       This property holds a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of options specified so  far  for  its  target.   Use  the
       <u>target_link_options()</u> command to append more options.

       This property is initialized by the <u>LINK_OPTIONS</u> directory property when a target is created, and is used
       by the generators to set the options for the compiler.

       Contents   of   <b>LINK_OPTIONS</b>   may   use  "generator  expressions"  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See  the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property must be used in preference to <u>LINK_FLAGS</u> property.

   <b>Host</b> <b>And</b> <b>Device</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Options</b>
       Added  in  version  3.18:  When  a   device   link   step   is   involved,   which   is   controlled   by
       <u>CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION</u> and <u>CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS</u> properties and policy <u>CMP0105</u>, the raw options
       will  be  delivered  to  the  host  and device link steps (wrapped in <b>-Xcompiler</b> or equivalent for device
       link). Options wrapped with <u>$&lt;DEVICE_LINK:...&gt;</u> generator expression will be used only for the device link
       step. Options wrapped with <u>$&lt;HOST_LINK:...&gt;</u> generator expression will be used  only  for  the  host  link
       step.

   <b>Option</b> <b>De-duplication</b>
       The final set of options used for a target is constructed by accumulating options from the current target
       and the usage requirements of its dependencies.  The set of options is de-duplicated to avoid repetition.

       Added  in  version  3.12:  While  beneficial for individual options, the de-duplication step can break up
       option groups.  For example, <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>-option</b> <b>B</b> becomes <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>B</b>.  One may specify a group of options
       using shell-like quoting along with a <b>SHELL:</b> prefix.  The <b>SHELL:</b> prefix is dropped, and the rest  of  the
       option  string is parsed using the <u>separate_arguments()</u> <b>UNIX_COMMAND</b> mode. For example, <b>"SHELL:-option</b> <b>A"</b>
       <b>"SHELL:-option</b> <b>B"</b> becomes <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>-option</b> <b>B</b>.

   <b>Handling</b> <b>Compiler</b> <b>Driver</b> <b>Differences</b>
       To pass options to the linker tool, each compiler driver has its own syntax.  The <b>LINKER:</b>  prefix  and  <b>,</b>
       separator  can  be  used  to  specify,  in a portable way, options to pass to the linker tool. <b>LINKER:</b> is
       replaced by the appropriate driver option and <b>,</b> by the appropriate driver separator.  The  driver  prefix
       and   driver   separator   are   given   by   the  values  of  the  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG</u>  and
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP</u> variables.

       For example, <b>"LINKER:-z,defs"</b> becomes <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>-z</b> <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>defs</b> for <b>Clang</b> and <b>-Wl,-z,defs</b> for <b>GNU</b> <b>GCC</b>.

       The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix can be specified as part of a <b>SHELL:</b> prefix expression.

       The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix supports, as an alternative syntax, specification of arguments using the <b>SHELL:</b> prefix
       and space as separator. The previous example then becomes <b>"LINKER:SHELL:-z</b> <b>defs"</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Specifying the <b>SHELL:</b> prefix anywhere other than at  the  beginning  of  the  <b>LINKER:</b>  prefix  is  not
          supported.

   <b>LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC</b>
       End a link line such that static system libraries are used.

       Some linkers support switches such as <b>-Bstatic</b> and <b>-Bdynamic</b> to determine whether to use static or shared
       libraries  for  <b>-lXXX</b>  options.   CMake  uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
       paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for  the  platform.   By  default
       CMake  adds an option at the end of the library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type back to
       its starting type.  This property switches the final linker search type to <b>-Bstatic</b> regardless of how  it
       started.

       This  property is initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC</u> if it is set when
       a target is created.

       See also <u>LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC</u>.

   <b>LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC</b>
       Assume the linker looks for static libraries by default.

       Some linkers support switches such as <b>-Bstatic</b> and <b>-Bdynamic</b> to determine whether to use static or shared
       libraries for <b>-lXXX</b> options.  CMake uses these options to set the link  type  for  libraries  whose  full
       paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the platform.  By default the
       linker  search  type  is  assumed  to  be  <b>-Bdynamic</b> at the beginning of the library list.  This property
       switches the assumption to <b>-Bstatic</b>.  It is intended for use when linking an executable statically  (e.g.
       with the GNU <b>-static</b> option).

       <b>This</b> <b>property</b> <b>is</b> <b>initialized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variable</b>
              <u>CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC</u> if it is set when a target is created.

       See also <u>LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC</u>.

   <b>LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       This  is  a  boolean  option  that,  when  set  to  <b>TRUE</b>,  will  automatically  run  contents of variable
       <u>CMAKE_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE_CHECK</u> on the target after it is linked. In addition, the linker flag specified by
       variable <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE_FLAG</u>  will be passed to the target with the link command so  that
       all  libraries specified on the command line will be linked into the target. This will result in the link
       producing a list of libraries that provide no symbols used by this target but are being linked to it.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          For now, it is only supported for <b>ELF</b> platforms and is only applicable to  executable  and  shared  or
          module library targets. This property will be ignored for any other targets and configurations.

       This  property  is  initialized  by the value of the <u>CMAKE_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE</u> variable if it is set when a
       target is created.

   <b>LINKER_LANGUAGE</b>
       Specifies language whose compiler will invoke the linker.

       For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this sets the language whose compiler is used to link the
       target (such as "C" or "CXX").  A typical value for an executable is the  language  of  the  source  file
       providing  the  program  entry point (main).  If not set, the language with the highest linker preference
       value is the default.  Details of the linker  preferences  are  considered  internal,  but  some  limited
       discussion can be found under the internal <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE</u> variables.

       If this property is not set by the user, it will be calculated at generate-time by CMake.

   <b>LINKER_TYPE</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       Specify which linker will be used for the link step. The property value may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          It  is  assumed  that the linker specified is fully compatible with the default one the compiler would
          normally invoke. CMake will not do any option translation.

       Linker types are case-sensitive and may only contain  letters,  numbers  and  underscores.  Linker  types
       defined in all uppercase are reserved for CMake's own built-in types. The pre-defined linker types are:

       <b>DEFAULT</b>
              This  type  corresponds  to  standard  linking,  essentially  equivalent to the <u>LINKER_TYPE</u> target
              property not being set at all.

       <b>SYSTEM</b> Use the standard linker provided by the platform or  toolchain.  For  example,  this  implies  the
              Microsoft  linker  for  all  MSVC-compatible  compilers.  This type is supported for the following
              platform-compiler combinations:

              • Linux: <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b>, <b>LLVMFlang</b>, <b>NVIDIA</b>, and <b>Swift</b> compilers.

              • Apple platforms: <b>AppleClang</b>, <b>Clang</b>, <b>GNU</b>, and <b>Swift</b> compilers.

              • Windows: <b>MSVC</b>, <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b>, <b>NVIDIA</b>, and <b>Swift</b> compilers.

       <b>LLD</b>    Use the <b>LLVM</b> linker. This type is supported for the following platform-compiler combinations:

              • Linux: <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b>, <b>LLVMFlang</b>, <b>NVIDIA</b>, and <b>Swift</b> compilers.

              • Apple platforms: <b>Clang</b>, <b>AppleClang</b>, and <b>Swift</b> compilers.

              • Windows: <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b> with MSVC-like front-end, <b>Clang</b> with GNU-like front-end, <b>MSVC</b>,  <b>NVIDIA</b>  with
                MSVC-like front-end, and <b>Swift</b>.

       <b>BFD</b>    Use the <b>GNU</b> linker.  This type is supported for the following platform-compiler combinations:

              • Linux: <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b>, <b>LLVMFlang</b>, and <b>NVIDIA</b> compilers.

              • Windows: <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b> with GNU-like front-end.

       <b>GOLD</b>   Supported on Linux platform with <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b>, <b>LLVMFlang</b>, <b>NVIDIA</b>, and <b>Swift</b> compilers.

       <b>MOLD</b>   Use the <u>mold</u> <u>linker</u>. This type is supported on the following platform-compiler combinations:

              • Linux: <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b>, <b>LLVMFlang</b>, and <b>NVIDIA</b> compilers.

              • Apple platforms: <b>Clang</b> and <b>AppleClang</b> compilers (acts as an alias to the <u>sold</u> <u>linker</u>).

       <b>SOLD</b>   Use  the  <u>sold</u>  <u>linker</u>.  This  type is only supported on Apple platforms with <b>Clang</b> and <b>AppleClang</b>
              compilers.

       <b>APPLE_CLASSIC</b>
              Use the Apple linker in the classic  behavior  (i.e.  before  <b>Xcode</b>  <b>15.0</b>).   This  type  is  only
              supported on Apple platforms with <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b>, <b>AppleClang</b>, and <b>Swift</b> compilers.

       <b>MSVC</b>   Use  the  Microsoft  linker.  This type is only supported on the Windows platform with <b>MSVC</b>, <b>Clang</b>
              with MSVC-like front-end, and <b>Swift</b> compilers.

       This property is not supported on <u>Green</u> <u>Hills</u> <u>MULTI</u> generator.

       The   implementation   details    for    the    selected    linker    will    be    provided    by    the
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_USING_LINKER_&lt;TYPE&gt;</u> variable. For example:

          add_library(lib1 SHARED ...)
          set_property(TARGET lib1 PROPERTY LINKER_TYPE LLD)

       This  specifies  that  <b>lib1</b>  should use linker type <b>LLD</b> for the link step.  The command line options that
       will be passed to the toolchain will be provided by the <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_USING_LINKER_LLD</b> variable.

       Note that the linker would typically be set using <u>CMAKE_LINKER_TYPE</u>  for  the  whole  build  rather  than
       setting the <b>LINKER_TYPE</b> property on individual targets.

   <b>LOCATION</b>
       Read-only location of a target on disk.

       For  an  imported target, this read-only property returns the value of the <b>LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> property for
       an unspecified configuration <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> provided by the target.

       For a non-imported target, this property is provided for compatibility with CMake 2.4 and below.  It  was
       meant  to  get  the  location of an executable target's output file for use in <u>add_custom_command()</u>.  The
       path may contain a build-system-specific portion that is replaced at build time  with  the  configuration
       getting  built  (such  as  <b>$(ConfigurationName)</b>  in  VS).   In  CMake  2.6 and above <u>add_custom_command()</u>
       automatically recognizes a target name in its  <b>COMMAND</b>  and  <b>DEPENDS</b>  options  and  computes  the  target
       location.   In  CMake  2.8.4  and above <u>add_custom_command()</u> recognizes <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> to refer to
       target locations anywhere in the command.  Therefore this property is  not  needed  for  creating  custom
       commands.

       Do  not  set  properties that affect the location of a target after reading this property.  These include
       properties    whose    names     match     <b>(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)?</b>,
       <b>(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)</b>, or "LINKER_LANGUAGE".  Failure to follow this rule is not diagnosed and leaves
       the location of the target undefined.

   <b>LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Read-only property providing a target location on disk.

       A  read-only  property that indicates where a target's main file is located on disk for the configuration
       <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>.  The property is defined only for library and  executable  targets.   An  imported  target  may
       provide a set of configurations different from that of the importing project.  By default CMake looks for
       an    exact-match    but    otherwise    uses    an   arbitrary   available   configuration.    Use   the
       <u>MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> property to map imported configurations explicitly.

       Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after reading this  property.   These  include
       properties     whose     names    match    <b>(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)?</b>,
       <b>(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)</b>, or  <u>LINKER_LANGUAGE</u>.  Failure to follow this rule is not diagnosed and  leaves
       the location of the target undefined.

   <b>MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       What compatibility version number is this target for Mach-O binaries.

       For  shared  libraries  on  Mach-O  systems  (e.g.  macOS,  iOS) the <b>MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</b> property
       corresponds to the <u>compatibility</u> <u>version</u> and <u>MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION</u> corresponds to  the  <u>current</u>  <u>version</u>.
       These  are  both  embedded  in  the  shared  library binary and can be checked with the <b>otool</b> <b>-L</b> <b>&lt;binary&gt;</b>
       command.

       It should be noted that the  <u>MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION</u>  and  <b>MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</b>  properties  do  not
       affect  the file names or version-related symlinks that CMake generates for the library.  The <u>VERSION</u> and
       <u>SOVERSION</u> target properties still control the file and symlink names.  The  <b>install_name</b>  is  also  still
       controlled by <u>SOVERSION</u>.

       When  <u>MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION</u> and <b>MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</b> are not given, <u>VERSION</u> and <u>SOVERSION</u> are used
       for the version details to be embedded in  the  binaries  respectively.   The  <u>MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION</u>  and
       <b>MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</b>  properties  only  need to be given if the project needs to decouple the file
       and symlink naming from the version details embedded in the binaries (e.g. to match libtool conventions).

   <b>MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       What current version number is this target for Mach-O binaries.

       For shared libraries on  Mach-O  systems  (e.g.  macOS,  iOS)  the  <u>MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</u>  property
       corresponds  to  the  <u>compatibility</u> <u>version</u> and <b>MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION</b> corresponds to the <u>current</u> <u>version</u>.
       These are both embedded in the shared library binary and can  be  checked  with  the  <b>otool</b>  <b>-L</b>  <b>&lt;binary&gt;</b>
       command.

       It  should  be  noted  that  the  <b>MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION</b> and <u>MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</u> properties do not
       affect the file names or version-related symlinks that CMake generates for the library.  The <u>VERSION</u>  and
       <u>SOVERSION</u>  target  properties  still  control the file and symlink names.  The <b>install_name</b> is also still
       controlled by <u>SOVERSION</u>.

       When <b>MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION</b> and <u>MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</u> are not given, <u>VERSION</u> and <u>SOVERSION</u> are  used
       for  the  version  details  to  be  embedded in the binaries respectively.  The <b>MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION</b> and
       <u>MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</u> properties only need to be given if the project needs to  decouple  the  file
       and symlink naming from the version details embedded in the binaries (e.g. to match libtool conventions).

   <b>MACOSX_BUNDLE</b>
       Build an executable as an Application Bundle on macOS or iOS.

       When  this  property  is  set  to  <b>TRUE</b>  the  executable when built on macOS or iOS will be created as an
       application bundle.  This makes it a GUI executable that can  be  launched  from  the  Finder.   See  the
       <u>MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST</u>  target  property  for information about creation of the <b>Info.plist</b> file for the
       application bundle.  This property is initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE</u> if  it
       is set when a target is created.

   <b>MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST</b>
       Specify a custom <b>Info.plist</b> template for a macOS and iOS Application Bundle.

       An  executable  target  with  <u>MACOSX_BUNDLE</u>  enabled will be built as an application bundle on macOS.  By
       default its <b>Info.plist</b> file is created by configuring a template called <b>MacOSXBundleInfo.plist.in</b> located
       in the <u>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</u>.  This property specifies an alternative template file name which may be a  full
       path.

       The following target properties may be set to specify content to be configured into the file:

       <b>MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME</b>
              Sets <b>CFBundleName</b>.

       <b>MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION</b>
              Sets <b>CFBundleVersion</b>.

       <b>MACOSX_BUNDLE_COPYRIGHT</b>
              Sets <b>NSHumanReadableCopyright</b>.

       <b>MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER</b>
              Sets <b>CFBundleIdentifier</b>.

       <b>MACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE</b>
              Sets <b>CFBundleIconFile</b>.

       <b>MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING</b>
              Sets <b>CFBundleGetInfoString</b>.

       <b>MACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING</b>
              Sets <b>CFBundleLongVersionString</b>.

       <b>MACOSX_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING</b>
              Sets <b>CFBundleShortVersionString</b>.

       CMake  variables  of  the same name may be set to affect all targets in a directory that do not have each
       specific property set.  If a custom <b>Info.plist</b> is specified by this property it may of  course  hard-code
       all the settings instead of using the target properties.

   <b>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST</b>
       Specify a custom <b>Info.plist</b> template for a macOS and iOS Framework.

       A library target with <u>FRAMEWORK</u> enabled will be built as a framework on macOS.  By default its <b>Info.plist</b>
       file   is   created  by  configuring  a  template  called  <b>MacOSXFrameworkInfo.plist.in</b>  located  in  the
       <u>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</u>.  This property specifies an alternative template file name which may be a full path.

       The following target properties may be set to specify content to be configured into the file:

       <b>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_NAME</b>
              Added in version 3.31.

              Sets <b>CFBundleName</b>.

       <b>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_VERSION</b>
              Sets <b>CFBundleVersion</b>.

       <b>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_ICON_FILE</b>
              Sets <b>CFBundleIconFile</b>.

       <b>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER</b>
              Sets <b>CFBundleIdentifier</b>.

       <b>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION_STRING</b>
              Sets <b>CFBundleShortVersionString</b>.

       CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a directory that do  not  have  each
       specific  property  set.  If a custom <b>Info.plist</b> is specified by this property it may of course hard-code
       all the settings instead of using the target properties.

   <b>MACOSX_RPATH</b>
       Whether this target on macOS or iOS is located at runtime using rpaths.

       When this property is set to <b>TRUE</b>, the directory portion of the <b>install_name</b> field of this shared library
       will be <b>@rpath</b> unless overridden by <u>INSTALL_NAME_DIR</u>.  This indicates the shared library is to  be  found
       at runtime using runtime paths (rpaths).

       This  property  is initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH</u> if it is set when a target
       is created.

       Runtime paths will also be embedded  in  binaries  using  this  target  and  can  be  controlled  by  the
       <u>INSTALL_RPATH</u> target property on the target linking to this target.

       Policy  <u>CMP0042</u>  was introduced to change the default value of <b>MACOSX_RPATH</b> to <b>TRUE</b>.  This is because use
       of <b>@rpath</b> is a more flexible and powerful alternative to <b>@executable_path</b> and <b>@loader_path</b>.

   <b>MANUALLY_ADDED_DEPENDENCIES</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Get manually added dependencies to other top-level targets.

       This read-only property can be used to query all dependencies that were added for this  target  with  the
       <u>add_dependencies()</u> command.

   <b>MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Map from project configuration to <u>imported</u> <u>target</u>'s configuration.

       Set  this  to the list of configurations of an imported target that may be used for the current project's
       <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> configuration.  Targets  imported  from  another  project  may  not  provide  the  same  set  of
       configuration  names  available  in the current project.  Setting this property tells CMake what imported
       configurations are suitable for use when building the <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> configuration.  The first configuration in
       the list found to be provided by  the  imported  target  (i.e.  via  <u>IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>  for  the
       mapped-to   <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>)   is   selected.   As  a  special  case,  an  empty  list  element  refers  to  the
       configuration-less imported target location (i.e. <u>IMPORTED_LOCATION</u>).

       If this property is set and no matching  configurations  are  available,  then  the  imported  target  is
       considered to be not found.  This property is ignored for non-imported targets.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> variable if it is set
       when a target is created.

   <b>Example</b>
       For example creating imported C++ library <b>foo</b>:

          add_library(foo STATIC IMPORTED)

       Use <b>foo_debug</b> path for <b>Debug</b> build type:

          set_property(
            TARGET foo APPEND PROPERTY IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS DEBUG
            )

          set_target_properties(foo PROPERTIES
            IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_DEBUG "CXX"
            IMPORTED_LOCATION_DEBUG "${foo_debug}"
            )

       Use <b>foo_release</b> path for <b>Release</b> build type:

          set_property(
            TARGET foo APPEND PROPERTY IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS RELEASE
            )

          set_target_properties(foo PROPERTIES
            IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_RELEASE "CXX"
            IMPORTED_LOCATION_RELEASE "${foo_release}"
            )

       Use <b>Release</b> version of library for <b>MinSizeRel</b> and <b>RelWithDebInfo</b> build types:

          set_target_properties(foo PROPERTIES
            MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_MINSIZEREL Release
            MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_RELWITHDEBINFO Release
            )

   <b>MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT</b>
       Added in version 3.25.

       Select debug information format when targeting the MSVC ABI.

       The allowed values are:

       <b>Embedded</b>
              Compile  with  <b>-Z7</b>  or  equivalent  flag(s)  to  produce object files with full symbolic debugging
              information.

       <b>ProgramDatabase</b>
              Compile with <b>-Zi</b> or equivalent flag(s) to  produce  a  program  database  that  contains  all  the
              symbolic debugging information.

       <b>EditAndContinue</b>
              Compile  with  <b>-ZI</b>  or equivalent flag(s) to produce a program database that supports the Edit and
              Continue feature.

       The value is ignored on compilers not targeting the MSVC ABI, but an unsupported value will  be  rejected
       as an error when using a compiler targeting the MSVC ABI.

       The value may also be the empty string (<b>""</b>), in which case no debug information format flag will be added
       explicitly by CMake.

       Use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> to support per-configuration specification.  For example, the code:

          add_executable(foo foo.c)
          set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY
            MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT "$&lt;$&lt;CONFIG:Debug,RelWithDebInfo&gt;:ProgramDatabase&gt;")

       selects for the target <b>foo</b> the program database debug information format for the Debug configuration.

       This property is initialized from the value of the <u>CMAKE_MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT</u> variable, if it is
       set.   If  this  property  is  not  set, CMake selects a debug information format using the default value
       <b>$&lt;$&lt;CONFIG:Debug,RelWithDebInfo&gt;:ProgramDatabase&gt;</b>,  if  supported  by   the   compiler,   and   otherwise
       <b>$&lt;$&lt;CONFIG:Debug,RelWithDebInfo&gt;:Embedded&gt;</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This  property  has  effect  only  when  policy  <u>CMP0141</u> is set to <b>NEW</b> prior to the first <u>project()</u> or
          <u>enable_language()</u> command that enables a language using a compiler targeting the MSVC ABI.

   <b>MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       Select the MSVC runtime library for use by compilers targeting the MSVC ABI.

       The allowed values are:

       <b>MultiThreaded</b>
              Compile with <b>-MT</b> or equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded statically-linked runtime library.

       <b>MultiThreadedDLL</b>
              Compile with <b>-MD</b> or equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded dynamically-linked runtime library.

       <b>MultiThreadedDebug</b>
              Compile with <b>-MTd</b> or equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded statically-linked runtime library.

       <b>MultiThreadedDebugDLL</b>
              Compile with <b>-MDd</b> or  equivalent  flag(s)  to  use  a  multi-threaded  dynamically-linked  runtime
              library.

       The  value  is ignored on compilers not targeting the MSVC ABI, but an unsupported value will be rejected
       as an error when using a compiler targeting the MSVC ABI.

       The value may also be the empty string (<b>""</b>) in which case no runtime library selection flag will be added
       explicitly by CMake.  Note that with <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> the native build system may choose  to  add
       its own default runtime library selection flag.

       Use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> to support per-configuration specification.  For example, the code:

          add_executable(foo foo.c)
          set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY
            MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY "MultiThreaded$&lt;$&lt;CONFIG:Debug&gt;:Debug&gt;")

       selects  for  the  target  <b>foo</b>  a  multi-threaded statically-linked runtime library with or without debug
       information depending on the configuration.

       The property is initialized from the value of the <u>CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</u> variable, if it is set.   If
       the  property  is  not set, then CMake uses the default value <b>MultiThreaded$&lt;$&lt;CONFIG:Debug&gt;:Debug&gt;DLL</b> to
       select a MSVC runtime library.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property has effect only when policy <u>CMP0091</u> is set to  <b>NEW</b>  prior  to  the  first  <u>project()</u>  or
          <u>enable_language()</u> command that enables a language using a compiler targeting the MSVC ABI.

   <b>NAME</b>
       Logical name for the target.

       Read-only logical name for the target as used by CMake.

   <b>NO_SONAME</b>
       Whether to set <b>soname</b> when linking a shared library.

       Enable this boolean property if a generated <b>SHARED</b> library should not have <b>soname</b> set.  Default is to set
       <b>soname</b>  on  all  shared libraries as long as the platform supports it.  Generally, use this property only
       for leaf private libraries or plugins.  If you use it on normal shared libraries which other targets link
       against, on some platforms a linker will insert a full path to the library (as specified  at  link  time)
       into  the  dynamic  section  of  the  dependent  binary.   Therefore,  once installed, dynamic loader may
       eventually fail to locate the library for the binary.

   <b>NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED</b>
       Do not treat include directories from the interfaces of consumed <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> as system directories.

       When   the   consumed   target's   <u>SYSTEM</u>   property   is   set   to   true,   the   contents   of    the
       <u>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> target property are treated as system includes or, on Apple platforms, when
       the target is a framework, it will be treated as system.  By default, <u>SYSTEM</u> is true for imported targets
       and  false for other target types.  If the <b>NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED</b> property is set to true on a <u>consuming</u>
       target,  compilation  of  sources  in  that  consuming  target  will  not  treat  the  contents  of   the
       <u>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>  of  consumed  imported  targets  as system includes, even if that imported
       target's <u>SYSTEM</u> property is false.

       Directories listed in the <u>INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>  property  of  consumed  targets  are  not
       affected  by  <b>NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED</b>.   Those  directories  will  always  be  treated  as system include
       directories by consumers.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED</u> variable if it is set when
       a target is created.

       See the <u>EXPORT_NO_SYSTEM</u> target property to set  this  behavior  on  the  target  providing  the  include
       directories rather than the target consuming them.

   <b>OBJC_EXTENSIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.

       This  property  specifies  whether compiler specific extensions should be used.  For some compilers, this
       results in adding a flag such as <b>-std=gnu11</b> instead of <b>-std=c11</b> to the compile line.  This property is <b>ON</b>
       by default. The basic OBJC standard level is controlled by the <u>OBJC_STANDARD</u> target property.

       If the property is not set, and the project has set the <u>C_EXTENSIONS</u>, the value of  <u>C_EXTENSIONS</u>  is  set
       for <b>OBJC_EXTENSIONS</b>.

       See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  information on compile features and a list of supported
       compilers.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_OBJC_EXTENSIONS</u> variable if set when a  target  is
       created and otherwise by the value of <u>CMAKE_OBJC_EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT</u> (see <u>CMP0128</u>).

   <b>OBJC_STANDARD</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       The OBJC standard whose features are requested to build this target.

       This  property  specifies  the OBJC standard whose features are requested to build this target.  For some
       compilers, this results in adding a flag such as <b>-std=gnu11</b> to the compile line.

       Supported values are:

       <b>90</b>     Objective C89/C90

       <b>99</b>     Objective C99

       <b>11</b>     Objective C11

       <b>17</b>     Added in version 3.21.

              Objective C17

       <b>23</b>     Added in version 3.21.

              Objective C23

       If the value requested does not result in a compile flag being added for the compiler in use, a  previous
       standard flag will be added instead.  This means that using:

          set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY OBJC_STANDARD 11)

       with  a  compiler  which does not support <b>-std=gnu11</b> or an equivalent flag will not result in an error or
       warning, but will instead add the <b>-std=gnu99</b> or <b>-std=gnu90</b> flag if supported.  This "decay" behavior  may
       be  controlled with the <u>OBJC_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u> target property.  Additionally, the <u>OBJC_EXTENSIONS</u> target
       property may be used to control whether compiler-specific extensions are enabled on a per-target basis.

       If the property is not set, and the project has set the <u>C_STANDARD</u>, the value of <u>C_STANDARD</u>  is  set  for
       <b>OBJC_STANDARD</b>.

       See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  information on compile features and a list of supported
       compilers.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_OBJC_STANDARD</u> variable if it is set when a  target
       is created.

   <b>OBJC_STANDARD_REQUIRED</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Boolean describing whether the value of <u>OBJC_STANDARD</u> is a requirement.

       If  this  property  is  set  to  <b>ON</b>,  then the value of the <u>OBJC_STANDARD</u> target property is treated as a
       requirement.  If this property is <b>OFF</b> or unset, the <u>OBJC_STANDARD</u> target property is treated as  optional
       and may "decay" to a previous standard if the requested is not available.

       If   the  property  is  not  set,  and  the  project  has  set  the  <u>C_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>,  the  value  of
       <u>C_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u> is set for <b>OBJC_STANDARD_REQUIRED</b>.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u> manual for information on compile features  and  a  list  of  supported
       compilers.

       This  property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_OBJC_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u> variable if it is set when
       a target is created.

   <b>OBJCXX_EXTENSIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.

       This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be used.  For  some  compilers,  this
       results  in  adding a flag such as <b>-std=gnu++11</b> instead of <b>-std=c++11</b> to the compile line.  This property
       is <b>ON</b> by default. The basic ObjC++ standard level is controlled by the <u>OBJCXX_STANDARD</u> target property.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u> manual for information on compile features  and  a  list  of  supported
       compilers.

       If  the  property  is not set, and the project has set the <u>CXX_EXTENSIONS</u>, the value of <u>CXX_EXTENSIONS</u> is
       set for <b>OBJCXX_EXTENSIONS</b>.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_OBJCXX_EXTENSIONS</u> variable if set when a target is
       created and otherwise by the value of <u>CMAKE_OBJCXX_EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT</u> (see <u>CMP0128</u>).

   <b>OBJCXX_STANDARD</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       The ObjC++ standard whose features are requested to build this target.

       This property specifies the ObjC++ standard whose features are requested to build this target.  For  some
       compilers, this results in adding a flag such as <b>-std=gnu++11</b> to the compile line.

       Supported values are:

       <b>98</b>     Objective C++98

       <b>11</b>     Objective C++11

       <b>14</b>     Objective C++14

       <b>17</b>     Objective C++17

       <b>20</b>     Objective C++20

       <b>23</b>     Added in version 3.20.

              Objective C++23

       <b>26</b>     Added in version 3.25.

              Objective  C++26.  CMake  3.25 and later <u>recognize</u> <b>26</b> as a valid value, no version has support for
              any compiler.

       If the value requested does not result in a compile flag being added for the compiler in use, a  previous
       standard flag will be added instead.  This means that using:

          set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY OBJCXX_STANDARD 11)

       with  a compiler which does not support <b>-std=gnu++11</b> or an equivalent flag will not result in an error or
       warning, but will instead add  the  <b>-std=gnu++98</b>  flag  if  supported.   This  "decay"  behavior  may  be
       controlled with the <u>OBJCXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u> target property.  Additionally, the <u>OBJCXX_EXTENSIONS</u> target
       property may be used to control whether compiler-specific extensions are enabled on a per-target basis.

       If  the  property  is not set, and the project has set the <u>CXX_STANDARD</u>, the value of <u>CXX_STANDARD</u> is set
       for <b>OBJCXX_STANDARD</b>.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u> manual for information on compile features  and  a  list  of  supported
       compilers.

       This  property  is  initialized  by  the  value of the <u>CMAKE_OBJCXX_STANDARD</u> variable if it is set when a
       target is created.

   <b>OBJCXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Boolean describing whether the value of <u>OBJCXX_STANDARD</u> is a requirement.

       If this property is set to <b>ON</b>, then the value of the <u>OBJCXX_STANDARD</u> target  property  is  treated  as  a
       requirement.   If  this  property  is  <b>OFF</b>  or  unset,  the <u>OBJCXX_STANDARD</u> target property is treated as
       optional and may "decay" to a previous standard if the requested is not available.

       If the  property  is  not  set,  and  the  project  has  set  the  <u>CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>,  the  value  of
       <u>CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u> is set for <b>OBJCXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</b>.

       See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  information on compile features and a list of supported
       compilers.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_OBJCXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u> variable  if  it  is  set
       when a target is created.

   <b>OPTIMIZE_DEPENDENCIES</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       Activates dependency optimization of static and object libraries.

       When  this  property  is  set to true, some dependencies for a static or object library may be removed at
       generation time if they are not necessary to build the library, since static and object  libraries  don't
       actually link against anything.

       If  a  static  or object library has dependency optimization enabled, it first discards all dependencies.
       Then, it looks through all of the direct and indirect dependencies that it initially had, and  adds  them
       back if they meet any of the following criteria:

       • The dependency was added to the library by <u>add_dependencies()</u>.

       • The  dependency  was  added  to  the library through a source file in the library generated by a custom
         command that uses the dependency.

       • The dependency has any <b>PRE_BUILD</b>, <b>PRE_LINK</b>, or <b>POST_BUILD</b> custom commands associated with it.

       • The dependency contains any source files that were generated by a custom command.

       • The dependency contains any languages which produce side effects that  are  relevant  to  the  library.
         Currently,  all  languages except C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, assembly, and CUDA are assumed to
         produce side effects.  However, side effects from one language  are  assumed  not  to  be  relevant  to
         another (for example, a Fortran library is assumed to not have any side effects that are relevant for a
         Swift library.)

       As  an  example,  assume  you have a static Fortran library which depends on a static C library, which in
       turn depends on a static Fortran library. The top-level Fortran library has optimization enabled, but the
       middle C library does not. If you build the top Fortran library, the bottom  Fortran  library  will  also
       build, but not the middle C library, since the C library does not have any side effects that are relevant
       for the Fortran library. However, if you build the middle C library, the bottom Fortran library will also
       build,  even  though  it  does  not have any side effects that are relevant to the C library, since the C
       library does not have optimization enabled.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_OPTIMIZE_DEPENDENCIES</u> variable when the target  is
       created.

   <b>OSX_ARCHITECTURES</b>
       Target specific architectures for macOS.

       The  <b>OSX_ARCHITECTURES</b>  property  sets the target binary architecture for targets on macOS (<b>-arch</b>).  This
       property is initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES</u> if it is set when  a  target
       is created.  Use <u>OSX_ARCHITECTURES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> to set the binary architectures on a per-configuration basis,
       where <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> is an upper-case name (e.g. <b>OSX_ARCHITECTURES_DEBUG</b>).

   <b>OSX_ARCHITECTURES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration macOS and iOS binary architectures for a target.

       This property is the configuration-specific version of <u>OSX_ARCHITECTURES</u>.

   <b>OUTPUT_NAME</b>
       Output name for target files.

       This  sets  the  base name for output files created for an executable or library target.  If not set, the
       logical target name is used by default during  generation.  The  value  is  not  set  by  default  during
       configuration.

       Contents of <b>OUTPUT_NAME</b> and the variants listed below may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       See also the variants:

       • <u>OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>

       • <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>

       • <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME</u>

       • <u>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>

       • <u>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME</u>

       • <u>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>

       • <u>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME</u>

   <b>OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration target file base name.

       This is the configuration-specific version of the <u>OUTPUT_NAME</u> target property.

   <b>PCH_INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       When  this  property  is  set  to  true,  the  precompiled header compiler options will contain a flag to
       instantiate templates during the generation of the PCH  if  supported.  This  can  significantly  improve
       compile times. Supported in Clang since version 11.

       This  property  is  initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_PCH_INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES</u> variable if it is set
       when a target is created.  If that variable is not set, the property defaults to <b>ON</b>.

   <b>PCH_WARN_INVALID</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       When this property is set to true, the precompile header compiler options will contain  a  compiler  flag
       which should warn about invalid precompiled headers e.g. <b>-Winvalid-pch</b> for GNU compiler.

       This  property  is  initialized  by  the value of the <u>CMAKE_PCH_WARN_INVALID</u> variable if it is set when a
       target is created.  If that variable is not set, the property defaults to <b>ON</b>.

   <b>PDB_NAME</b>
       Output name for the MS debug symbol <b>.pdb</b> file generated by the linker for an executable or shared library
       target.

       This property specifies the base name for the debug symbols file.  If not  set,  the  <u>OUTPUT_NAME</u>  target
       property value or logical target name is used by default.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property does not apply to STATIC library targets because no linker is invoked to produce them so
          they have no linker-generated <b>.pdb</b> file containing debug symbols.

          The linker-generated program database files are specified by the <b>/pdb</b> linker flag and are not the same
          as   compiler-generated  program  database  files  specified  by  the  <b>/Fd</b>  compiler  flag.   Use  the
          <u>COMPILE_PDB_NAME</u> property to specify the latter.

   <b>PDB_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration output name for the MS debug symbol <b>.pdb</b> file generated by the linker for an executable
       or shared library target.

       This is the configuration-specific version of <u>PDB_NAME</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property does not apply to STATIC library targets because no linker is invoked to produce them so
          they have no linker-generated <b>.pdb</b> file containing debug symbols.

          The linker-generated program database files are specified by the <b>/pdb</b> linker flag and are not the same
          as  compiler-generated  program  database  files  specified  by  the  <b>/Fd</b>  compiler  flag.   Use   the
          <u>COMPILE_PDB_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> property to specify the latter.

   <b>PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</b>
       Output  directory  for the MS debug symbols <b>.pdb</b> file generated by the linker for an executable or shared
       library target.

       This property specifies the directory into which the MS debug symbols will be placed by the  linker.  The
       property  value may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.  Multi-configuration generators append a per-configuration
       subdirectory to the specified directory unless a generator expression is used.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u> variable if it is set when  a
       target is created.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property does not apply to STATIC library targets because no linker is invoked to produce them so
          they have no linker-generated <b>.pdb</b> file containing debug symbols.

          The linker-generated program database files are specified by the <b>/pdb</b> linker flag and are not the same
          as   compiler-generated  program  database  files  specified  by  the  <b>/Fd</b>  compiler  flag.   Use  the
          <u>COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u> property to specify the latter.

   <b>PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration output directory for the MS debug symbol <b>.pdb</b> file  generated  by  the  linker  for  an
       executable or shared library target.

       This  is  a per-configuration version of <u>PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u>, but multi-configuration generators (<u>Visual</u>
       <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>, <u>Xcode</u>) do NOT append a per-configuration  subdirectory  to  the  specified  directory.
       This  property  is  initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> variable if it is
       set when a target is created.

       Contents of <b>PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property does not apply to STATIC library targets because no linker is invoked to produce them so
          they have no linker-generated <b>.pdb</b> file containing debug symbols.

          The linker-generated program database files are specified by the <b>/pdb</b> linker flag and are not the same
          as  compiler-generated  program  database  files  specified  by  the  <b>/Fd</b>  compiler  flag.   Use   the
          <u>COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> property to specify the latter.

   <b>POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</b>
       Whether to create a position-independent target

       The  <b>POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</b>  property  determines  whether  position independent executables or shared
       libraries will be created.  This property is <b>True</b> by default for <b>SHARED</b> and <b>MODULE</b>  library  targets  and
       <b>False</b>  otherwise.   This  property  is  initialized  by  the value of the <u>CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</u>
       variable  if it is set when a target is created.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          For executable targets, the link step is controlled by the <u>CMP0083</u> policy  and  the  <u>CheckPIESupported</u>
          module.

   <b>PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       List of header files to precompile.

       This  property  holds  a  <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of header files to precompile specified so far for its
       target.  Use the <u>target_precompile_headers()</u> command to append more header files.

       This property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

   <b>PRECOMPILE_HEADERS_REUSE_FROM</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Target from which to reuse the precompiled headers build artifact.

       See the second signature of <u>target_precompile_headers()</u> command for more detailed information.

   <b>PREFIX</b>
       What comes before the library name.

       A target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as <b>lib</b>) on a library name.

   <b>PRIVATE_HEADER</b>
       Specify private header files in a <u>FRAMEWORK</u> shared library target.

       Shared library targets marked with the <u>FRAMEWORK</u> property generate frameworks on macOS,  iOS  and  normal
       shared  libraries on other platforms.  This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in
       the PrivateHeaders directory inside the framework folder.  On non-Apple platforms these  headers  may  be
       installed using the <b>PRIVATE_HEADER</b> option to the <u>install(TARGETS)</u> command.

   <b>PROJECT_LABEL</b>
       Change the name of a target in an IDE.

       Can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE like Visual Studio.

   <b>PUBLIC_HEADER</b>
       Specify public header files in a <u>FRAMEWORK</u> shared library target.

       Shared  library  targets  marked with the <u>FRAMEWORK</u> property generate frameworks on macOS, iOS and normal
       shared libraries on other platforms.  This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed  in
       the <b>Headers</b> directory inside the framework folder.  On non-Apple platforms these headers may be installed
       using the <b>PUBLIC_HEADER</b> option to the <u>install(TARGETS)</u> command.

   <b>RESOURCE</b>
       Specify resource files in a <u>FRAMEWORK</u> or <u>BUNDLE</u>.

       Target  marked with the <u>FRAMEWORK</u> or <u>BUNDLE</u> property generate framework or application bundle (both macOS
       and iOS is supported) or normal shared libraries on other platforms.  This property may be set to a  list
       of  files  to  be  placed  in  the corresponding directory (eg. <b>Resources</b> directory for macOS) inside the
       bundle.  On non-Apple  platforms  these  files  may  be  installed  using  the  <b>RESOURCE</b>  option  to  the
       <u>install(TARGETS)</u> command.

       Following example of Application Bundle:

          add_executable(ExecutableTarget
            addDemo.c
            resourcefile.txt
            appresourcedir/appres.txt)

          target_link_libraries(ExecutableTarget heymath mul)

          set(RESOURCE_FILES
            resourcefile.txt
            appresourcedir/appres.txt)

          set_target_properties(ExecutableTarget PROPERTIES
            MACOSX_BUNDLE TRUE
            MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER org.cmake.ExecutableTarget
            RESOURCE "${RESOURCE_FILES}")

       will produce flat structure for iOS systems:

          ExecutableTarget.app
            appres.txt

   <b>RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE</b>
       Specify a launcher for compile rules.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This  property  is  intended  for  internal  use  by <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u>.  Projects and developers should use the
          <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LAUNCHER</u> target properties or the associated <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LAUNCHER</u>  variables
          instead.

       See  the  <u>global</u> <u>property</u> of the same name for details.  This overrides the global and directory property
       for a target.

   <b>RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM</b>
       Specify a launcher for custom rules.

       See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides the global and  directory  property
       for a target.

   <b>RULE_LAUNCH_LINK</b>
       Specify a launcher for link rules.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This  property  is  intended  for  internal  use  by <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u>.  Projects and developers should use the
          <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_LAUNCHER</u> target properties  or  the  associated  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_LAUNCHER</u>  variables
          instead.

       See  the  <u>global</u> <u>property</u> of the same name for details.  This overrides the global and directory property
       for a target.

   <b>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</b>
       Output directory in which to build <u>RUNTIME</u> target files.

       This property specifies the directory into which runtime target files  should  be  built.   The  property
       value  may  use  <u>generator</u>  <u>expressions</u>.   Multi-configuration  generators  (<u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>, <u>Xcode</u>, <u>Ninja</u>
       <u>Multi-Config</u>) append a per-configuration subdirectory to  the  specified  directory  unless  a  generator
       expression is used.

       This  property  is  initialized  by the value of the <u>CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u> variable if it is set
       when a target is created.

       See also the <u>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> target property.

   <b>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration output directory for <u>RUNTIME</u> target files.

       This  is  a  per-configuration   version   of   the   <u>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u>   target   property,   but
       multi-configuration  generators  (<u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u>,  <u>Xcode</u>)  do  NOT append a per-configuration
       subdirectory  to  the  specified  directory.   This  property  is  initialized  by  the  value   of   the
       <u>CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> variable if it is set when a target is created.

       Contents of <b>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

   <b>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME</b>
       Output name for <u>RUNTIME</u> target files.

       This  property  specifies  the  base  name  for  runtime  target  files.   It  overrides  <u>OUTPUT_NAME</u> and
       <u>OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> properties.

       See also the <u>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> target property.

   <b>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration output name for <u>RUNTIME</u> target files.

       This is the configuration-specific version of the <u>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME</u> target property.

   <b>SKIP_BUILD_RPATH</b>
       Should rpaths be used for the build tree.

       <b>SKIP_BUILD_RPATH</b> is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic generation of an  rpath  allowing  the
       target  to  run  from  the  build  tree,  see  also  the  <u>BUILD_RPATH</u>  target property.  This property is
       initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH</u> if it is set when a target is created.

   <b>SOURCE_DIR</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       This read-only property reports the value of the <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u> variable in  the  directory  in
       which the target was defined.

   <b>SOURCES</b>
       This  specifies  the list of paths to source files for the target.  The following commands all set or add
       to the <b>SOURCES</b> target property and are the usual way to manipulate it:

       • <u>add_executable()</u>

       • <u>add_library()</u>

       • <u>add_custom_target()</u>

       • <u>target_sources()</u>

       Contents of <b>SOURCES</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.  If a path starts with a generator expression,  it  is
       expected to evaluate to an absolute path. Not doing so is considered undefined behavior.

       Paths that are for files generated by the build will be treated as relative to the build directory of the
       target,  if  the  path is not already specified as an absolute path.  Note that whether a file is seen as
       generated may be affected by policies <u>CMP0118</u> and <u>CMP0163</u>.

       If a path does not start with a generator expression, is not an absolute path  and  is  not  a  generated
       file, it will be treated as relative to the location selected by the first of the following that matches:

       • If a file by the specified path exists relative to the target's source directory, use that file.

       • If  policy  <u>CMP0115</u>  is  not set to <b>NEW</b>, try appending each known source file extension to the path and
         check if that exists relative to the target's source directory.

       • Repeat the above two steps, this time relative to the target's binary directory instead.

       Note that the above decisions are made at generation time, not build time.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>SOVERSION</b>
       ABI version number of a shared library target.

       For shared libraries <u>VERSION</u> and <b>SOVERSION</b> can be used to specify  the  build  version  and  ABI  version
       respectively.   When  building  or  installing  appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports
       symlinks and the linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is specified the missing  is  assumed  to
       have the same version number.  <b>SOVERSION</b> is ignored if <u>NO_SONAME</u> property is set.

       A  common  convention  is  to  specify  both  <b>VERSION</b> and <b>SOVERSION</b> such that <b>SOVERSION</b> matches the first
       component of <b>VERSION</b>:

          set_target_properties(mylib PROPERTIES VERSION 1.2.3 SOVERSION 1)

       The idea is that breaking changes to the ABI increment both the <b>SOVERSION</b> and the major <b>VERSION</b> number.

   <b>Windows</b> <b>Versions</b>
       For shared  libraries  and  executables  on  Windows  the  <u>VERSION</u>  attribute  is  parsed  to  extract  a
       <b>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;</b> version number.  These numbers are used as the image version of the binary.

   <b>Mach-O</b> <b>Versions</b>
       For  shared  libraries  and  executables  on  Mach-O  systems  (e.g.  macOS, iOS), the <b>SOVERSION</b> property
       corresponds to the <u>compatibility</u> <u>version</u> and <u>VERSION</u> corresponds to the <u>current</u>  <u>version</u>  (unless  Mach-O
       specific overrides are provided, as discussed below).  See the <u>FRAMEWORK</u> target property for an example.

       For shared libraries, the <u>MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</u> and <u>MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION</u> properties can be used to
       override  the  <u>compatibility</u> <u>version</u> and <u>current</u> <u>version</u> respectively.  Note that <b>SOVERSION</b> will still be
       used to form the <b>install_name</b> and both <b>SOVERSION</b> and <u>VERSION</u> may also affect the file and symlink names.

       Versions of Mach-O binaries may be checked with the <b>otool</b> <b>-L</b> <b>&lt;binary&gt;</b> command.

   <b>STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS</b>
       Archiver (or MSVC librarian) flags for a static library  target.   Targets  that  are  shared  libraries,
       modules, or executables need to use the <u>LINK_OPTIONS</u> or <u>LINK_FLAGS</u> target properties.

       The  <b>STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS</b>  property, managed as a string, can be used to add extra flags to the link step
       of a static library target.  <u>STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> will add to the  configuration  <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>,  for
       example, <b>DEBUG</b>, <b>RELEASE</b>, <b>MINSIZEREL</b>, <b>RELWITHDEBINFO</b>, ...

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property has been superseded by <u>STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS</u> property.

   <b>STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration archiver (or MSVC librarian) flags for a static library target.

       This is the configuration-specific version of <u>STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property has been superseded by <u>STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS</u> property.

   <b>STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       Archiver  (or  MSVC  librarian)  flags  for  a static library target.  Targets that are shared libraries,
       modules, or executables need to use the <u>LINK_OPTIONS</u> target property.

       This property holds a <u>semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  of  options  specified  so  far  for  its  target.   Use
       <u>set_target_properties()</u> or <u>set_property()</u> commands to set its content.

       Contents  of  <b>STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS</b>  may  use  "generator  expressions" with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property must be used in preference to <u>STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS</u> property.

   <b>Option</b> <b>De-duplication</b>
       The final set of options used for a target is constructed by accumulating options from the current target
       and the usage requirements of its dependencies.  The set of options is de-duplicated to avoid repetition.

       Added in version 3.12: While beneficial for individual options, the  de-duplication  step  can  break  up
       option groups.  For example, <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>-option</b> <b>B</b> becomes <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>B</b>.  One may specify a group of options
       using  shell-like  quoting along with a <b>SHELL:</b> prefix.  The <b>SHELL:</b> prefix is dropped, and the rest of the
       option string is parsed using the <u>separate_arguments()</u> <b>UNIX_COMMAND</b> mode. For example, <b>"SHELL:-option</b>  <b>A"</b>
       <b>"SHELL:-option</b> <b>B"</b> becomes <b>-option</b> <b>A</b> <b>-option</b> <b>B</b>.

   <b>SUFFIX</b>
       What comes after the target name.

       A  target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as <b>.so</b> or <b>.exe</b>) on the name of a library,
       module or executable.

   <b>Swift_COMPILATION_MODE</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       Specify how Swift compiles a target.

       The allowed values are:

       <b>incremental</b>
              Compiles each Swift source in the module separately, resulting in better parallelism in the build.
              The compiler emits additional information into the build directory improving  rebuild  performance
              when  small  changes are made to the source between rebuilds. This is the best option to use while
              iterating on changes in a project.

       <b>wholemodule</b>
              Whole-module optimizations are slowest to compile, but results in the most optimized library.  The
              entire  context  is  loaded  into once instance of the compiler, so there is no parallelism across
              source files in the module.

       <b>singlefile</b>
              Compiles each source in a Swift modules separately, resulting in better  parallelism.  Unlike  the
              <b>incremental</b>  build mode, no additional information is emitted by the compiler during the build, so
              rebuilding after making small changes to the source file will not run faster. This  option  should
              be used sparingly, preferring <b>incremental</b> builds, unless working around a compiler bug.

       Use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> to support per-configuration specification. For example, the code:

          add_library(foo foo.swift)
          set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY
            Swift_COMPILATION_MODE "$&lt;IF:$&lt;CONFIG:Release&gt;,wholemodule,incremental&gt;")

       sets the Swift compilation mode to wholemodule mode in the release configuration and sets the property to
       incremental mode in other configurations.

       The property is initialized from the value of the <u>CMAKE_Swift_COMPILATION_MODE</u> variable, if it is set. If
       the  property  is not set or is empty, then CMake uses the default value <b>incremental</b> to specify the swift
       compilation mode.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property only has effect when policy <u>CMP0157</u> is set to  <b>NEW</b>  prior  to  the  first  <u>project()</u>  or
          <u>enable_language()</u> command that enables the Swift language.

   <b>Swift_DEPENDENCIES_FILE</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       This  property  sets  the  path  for  the Swift dependency file (swiftdep) for the target.  If one is not
       specified, it will default to <b>&lt;TARGET&gt;.swiftdeps</b>.

   <b>Swift_LANGUAGE_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       This property sets the language version for the Swift sources in the target.  If one is not specified, it
       will default to <u>CMAKE_Swift_LANGUAGE_VERSION</u> if specified, otherwise it is the latest  version  supported
       by the compiler.

   <b>Swift_MODULE_DIRECTORY</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       Specify output directory for Swift modules provided by the target.

       If  the  target  contains  Swift  source files, this specifies the directory in which the modules will be
       placed.  When this property is not set, the modules will be placed in the build  directory  corresponding
       to  the  target's source directory.  If the variable <u>CMAKE_Swift_MODULE_DIRECTORY</u> is set when a target is
       created its value is used to initialize this property.

       <b>WARNING:</b>
          This property does not currently provide a way to express per-config module directories, so  use  with
          multi-config generators is problematic:

          • The <u>Xcode</u> generator does not implement the property at all.

          • The  <u>Ninja</u> <u>Multi-Config</u> generator implements this property, but module files generated for different
            build configurations have the same path, which can lead to subtle problems when building  more  than
            one configuration.

   <b>Swift_MODULE_NAME</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       This property specifies the name of the Swift module.  It is defaulted to the name of the target.

   <b>SYSTEM</b>
       Added in version 3.25.

       Specifies that a target is a system target.  This has the following effects:

       • Entries  of  <u>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>  are  treated  as  system include directories when compiling
         consumers.  Entries of <u>INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>  are  not  affected,  and  will  always  be
         treated as system include directories.

       • On  Apple  platforms,  If the <u>FRAMEWORK</u> target property is true, the frameworks directory is treated as
         system.

       For   imported   targets,   this   property    defaults    to    true,    which    means    that    their
       <u>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>  and,  if  the  <u>FRAMEWORK</u> target property is true, frameworks directory are
       treated  as  system  directories  by  default.   If  their  <b>SYSTEM</b>  property   is   false,   then   their
       <u>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>   as   well  as  frameworks  will  not  be  treated  as  system.   Use  the
       <u>EXPORT_NO_SYSTEM</u> property to change how a target's <b>SYSTEM</b> property is set when it is installed.

       For non-imported targets, this target property is initialized from the <u>SYSTEM</u> directory property when the
       target is created.

   <b>TEST_LAUNCHER</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       Use the given launcher to run executables.  This command will be added as a prefix to <u>add_test()</u> commands
       for build target system executables and is meant to be run on the host machine.

       It effectively acts as a run script for tests in a  similar  way  to  how  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LAUNCHER</u>
       works for compilation.

       If  this  property contains a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u>, then the first value is the command and remaining
       values are its arguments.

       Contents of <b>TEST_LAUNCHER</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_TEST_LAUNCHER</u> variable if it is set when a  target
       is created.

   <b>TRANSITIVE_COMPILE_PROPERTIES</b>
       Added in version 3.30.

       Properties  that the <u>TARGET_PROPERTY</u> generator expression, on the target and its dependents, evaluates as
       the union of values collected from the transitive closure of link dependencies, excluding entries guarded
       by <u>LINK_ONLY</u>.

       The value is a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of <u>custom</u> <u>transitive</u>  <u>property</u>  names.   Any  leading  <b>INTERFACE_</b>
       prefix is ignored, e.g., <b>INTERFACE_PROP</b> is treated as just <b>PROP</b>.

       See  documentation  of the <u>TARGET_PROPERTY</u> generator expression for details of custom transitive property
       evaluation.  See also the <u>TRANSITIVE_LINK_PROPERTIES</u> target property, which includes entries  guarded  by
       <u>LINK_ONLY</u>.

   <b>TRANSITIVE_LINK_PROPERTIES</b>
       Added in version 3.30.

       Properties  that the <u>TARGET_PROPERTY</u> generator expression, on the target and its dependents, evaluates as
       the union of values collected from the transitive closure of link dependencies, including entries guarded
       by <u>LINK_ONLY</u>.

       The value is a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of <u>custom</u> <u>transitive</u>  <u>property</u>  names.   Any  leading  <b>INTERFACE_</b>
       prefix is ignored, e.g., <b>INTERFACE_PROP</b> is treated as just <b>PROP</b>.

       See  documentation  of the <u>TARGET_PROPERTY</u> generator expression for details of custom transitive property
       evaluation.  See also the <u>TRANSITIVE_COMPILE_PROPERTIES</u> target property, which excludes  entries  guarded
       by <u>LINK_ONLY</u>..

   <b>TYPE</b>
       The type of the target.

       This  read-only  property  can  be  used  to  test  the  type  of  the  given  target.  It will be one of
       <b>STATIC_LIBRARY</b>, <b>MODULE_LIBRARY</b>, <b>SHARED_LIBRARY</b>, <b>OBJECT_LIBRARY</b>, <b>INTERFACE_LIBRARY</b>, <b>EXECUTABLE</b> or  one  of
       the internal target types.

   <b>UNITY_BUILD</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       When  this  property  is  set  to  true, the target source files will be combined into batches for faster
       compilation.  This is done by creating a (set of) unity sources which <b>#include</b> the original sources, then
       compiling these unity sources instead of the originals.  This is known as a <u>Unity</u> or <u>Jumbo</u> build.

       CMake provides different algorithms for selecting which sources  are  grouped  together  into  a  <u>bucket</u>.
       Algorithm  selection  is  decided  by  the  <u>UNITY_BUILD_MODE</u>  target  property,  which  has the following
       acceptable values:

       • <b>BATCH</b> When in this mode CMake determines which files are grouped together.  The  <u>UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE</u>
         property controls the upper limit on how many sources can be combined per unity source file.

       • <b>GROUP</b>  When  in  this mode each target explicitly specifies how to group source files. Each source file
         that has the same <u>UNITY_GROUP</u> value will be grouped together. Any sources that don't have this property
         will be compiled individually. The <u>UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE</u> property is ignored when using this mode.

       If no explicit <u>UNITY_BUILD_MODE</u> has been specified, CMake will default to <b>BATCH</b>.

       Unity builds are supported for the following languages:

       <b>C</b>      Added in version 3.16.

       <b>CXX</b>    Added in version 3.16.

       <b>CUDA</b>   Added in version 3.31.

       <b>OBJC</b>   Added in version 3.29.

       <b>OBJCXX</b> Added in version 3.29.

       For targets that mix source files from more than one language, CMake separates the  languages  such  that
       each generated unity source file only contains sources for a single language.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD</u> variable when a target is created.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Projects should not directly set the <b>UNITY_BUILD</b> property or its associated <u>CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD</u> variable
          to  true.  Depending on the capabilities of the build machine and compiler used, it might or might not
          be appropriate to enable unity builds.  Therefore, this feature should  be  under  developer  control,
          which  would  normally  be  through the developer choosing whether or not to set the <u>CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD</u>
          variable on the <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u> command line or some other equivalent method.  However, it IS recommended  to
          set  the <b>UNITY_BUILD</b> target property to false if it is known that enabling unity builds for the target
          can lead to problems.

   <b>ODR</b> <b>(One</b> <b>definition</b> <b>rule)</b> <b>errors</b>
       When multiple source files are included into one source file,  as  is  done  for  unity  builds,  it  can
       potentially lead to ODR errors.  CMake provides a number of measures to help address such problems:

       • Any   source  file  that  has  a  non-empty  <u>COMPILE_OPTIONS</u>,  <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u>,  <u>COMPILE_FLAGS</u>,  or
         <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> source property will not be combined into a unity source.

       • Any source file which is scanned for C++ module sources via <u>CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES</u>, <u>CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES</u>,
         or  membership  of  a  <b>CXX_MODULES</b>  file  set  will  not  be  combined  into  a  unity   source.    See
         <u><a href="../man7/cmake-cxxmodules.7.html">cmake-cxxmodules</a>(7)</u> for details.

       • Projects  can  prevent an individual source file from being combined into a unity source by setting its
         <u>SKIP_UNITY_BUILD_INCLUSION</u> source property to true.  This can  be  a  more  effective  way  to  prevent
         problems with specific files than disabling unity builds for an entire target.

       • Projects  can  set  <u>UNITY_BUILD_UNIQUE_ID</u> to cause a valid C-identifier to be generated which is unique
         per file in a unity build.  This can be used to avoid  problems  with  anonymous  namespaces  in  unity
         builds.

       • The <u>UNITY_BUILD_CODE_BEFORE_INCLUDE</u> and <u>UNITY_BUILD_CODE_AFTER_INCLUDE</u> target properties can be used to
         inject code into the unity source files before and after every <b>#include</b> statement.

       • The  order  of  source  files  added to the target via commands like <u>add_library()</u>, <u>add_executable()</u> or
         <u>target_sources()</u> will be preserved in the generated unity source files.  This can be used  to  manually
         enforce a specific grouping based on the <u>UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE</u> target property.

   <b>UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Specifies  the  maximum  number  of source files that can be combined into any one unity source file when
       unity builds are enabled by  the  <u>UNITY_BUILD</u>  target  property.   The  original  source  files  will  be
       distributed across as many unity source files as necessary to honor this limit.

       The  initial  value  for  this  property is taken from the <u>CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE</u> variable when the
       target is created.  If that variable has not been set, the initial value will be 8.

       The batch size needs to be selected carefully.  If set too high, the size of the  combined  source  files
       could  result  in the compiler using excessive memory or hitting other similar limits.  In extreme cases,
       this can even result in build failure.  On the other hand, if the batch size is too low,  there  will  be
       little gain in build performance.

       Although  strongly  discouraged, the batch size may be set to a value of 0 to combine all the sources for
       the target into a single unity file, regardless of how many sources are involved.  This runs the risk  of
       creating  an  excessively  large  unity  source file and negatively impacting the build performance, so a
       value of 0 is not generally recommended.

   <b>UNITY_BUILD_CODE_AFTER_INCLUDE</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Code snippet which is included verbatim by the <u>UNITY_BUILD</u> feature just after every <b>#include</b> statement in
       the generated unity source files.  For example:

          set(after [[
          #if defined(NOMINMAX)
          #undef NOMINMAX
          #endif
          ]])
          set_target_properties(myTarget PROPERTIES
            UNITY_BUILD_CODE_AFTER_INCLUDE "${after}"
          )

       See also <u>UNITY_BUILD_CODE_BEFORE_INCLUDE</u>.

   <b>UNITY_BUILD_CODE_BEFORE_INCLUDE</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Code snippet which is included verbatim by the <u>UNITY_BUILD</u> feature just before every  <b>#include</b>  statement
       in the generated unity source files.  For example:

          set(before [[
          #if !defined(NOMINMAX)
          #define NOMINMAX
          #endif
          ]])
          set_target_properties(myTarget PROPERTIES
            UNITY_BUILD_CODE_BEFORE_INCLUDE "${before}"
          )

       See also <u>UNITY_BUILD_CODE_AFTER_INCLUDE</u>.

   <b>UNITY_BUILD_MODE</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       CMake  provides  different  algorithms  for  selecting  which sources are grouped together into a <u>bucket</u>.
       Selection is decided by this property, which has the following acceptable values:

       <b>BATCH</b>  When in this mode CMake determines which files are grouped together.   The  <u>UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE</u>
              property controls the upper limit on how many sources can be combined per unity source file.

              Example usage:

                 add_library(example_library
                             source1.cxx
                             source2.cxx
                             source3.cxx
                             source4.cxx)

                 set_target_properties(example_library PROPERTIES
                                       UNITY_BUILD_MODE BATCH
                                       UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE 2
                                       )

       <b>GROUP</b>  When  in  this  mode  each target explicitly specifies how to group source files. Each source file
              that has the same <u>UNITY_GROUP</u> value will be grouped together. Any sources  that  don't  have  this
              property  will be compiled individually. The <u>UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE</u> property is ignored when using
              this mode.

              Example usage:

                 add_library(example_library
                             source1.cxx
                             source2.cxx
                             source3.cxx
                             source4.cxx)

                 set_target_properties(example_library PROPERTIES
                                       UNITY_BUILD_MODE GROUP
                                       )

                 set_source_files_properties(source1.cxx source2.cxx source3.cxx
                                             PROPERTIES UNITY_GROUP "bucket1"
                                             )
                 set_source_files_properties(source4.cxx
                                             PROPERTIES UNITY_GROUP "bucket2"
                                             )

       If no explicit <b>UNITY_BUILD_MODE</b> has been specified, CMake will default to <b>BATCH</b>.

   <b>UNITY_BUILD_UNIQUE_ID</b>
       Added in version 3.20.

       The name of a valid C-identifier which is set to a unique per-file value during unity builds.

       When this property is populated and when <u>UNITY_BUILD</u> is true, the property value  is  used  to  define  a
       compiler  definition  of  the  specified  name. The value of the defined symbol is unspecified, but it is
       unique per file path.

       Given:

          set_target_properties(myTarget PROPERTIES
            UNITY_BUILD "ON"
            UNITY_BUILD_UNIQUE_ID "MY_UNITY_ID"
          )

       the <b>MY_UNITY_ID</b> symbol is defined to a unique per-file value.

       One known use case for this identifier is to disambiguate the variables in an anonymous  namespace  in  a
       limited  scope.   Anonymous namespaces present a problem for unity builds because they are used to ensure
       that certain variables and declarations are scoped to a translation  unit  which  is  approximated  by  a
       single  source  file.  When source files are combined in a unity build file, those variables in different
       files are combined in a single translation unit and the names clash.  This property can be used to  avoid
       that with code like the following:

          // Needed for when unity builds are disabled
          #ifndef MY_UNITY_ID
          #define MY_UNITY_ID
          #endif

          namespace { namespace MY_UNITY_ID {
            // The name 'i' clashes (or could clash) with other
            // variables in other anonymous namespaces
            int i = 42;
          }}

          int use_var()
          {
            return MY_UNITY_ID::i;
          }

       The pseudonymous namespace is used within a truly anonymous namespace.  On many platforms, this maintains
       the invariant that the symbols within do not get external linkage when performing a unity build.

   <b>VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       Used  to  verify that all headers in a target's <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b> header sets can be included on their
       own.

       When this property is set to true, and the target is an object library, static library,  shared  library,
       interface library, or executable with exports enabled, and the target has one or more <b>PUBLIC</b> or <b>INTERFACE</b>
       header  sets,  an object library target named <b>&lt;target_name&gt;_verify_interface_header_sets</b> is created. This
       verification target has one source file per header in the <b>PUBLIC</b> and <b>INTERFACE</b> header sets.  Each  source
       file  only includes its associated header file. The verification target links against the original target
       to  get  all  of  its  usage  requirements.  The  verification  target  has  its   <u>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</u>   and
       <u>DISABLE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</u>  properties  set  to  true, and its <u>AUTOMOC</u>, <u>AUTORCC</u>, <u>AUTOUIC</u>, and <u>UNITY_BUILD</u>
       properties set to false.

       If the header's <u>LANGUAGE</u> property is set, the value of that property is used to  determine  the  language
       with  which  to  compile  the  header  file.  Otherwise, if the target has any C++ sources, the header is
       compiled as C++.  Otherwise, if the target has any C sources, the header is compiled as C.  Otherwise, if
       C++ is enabled globally, the header is compiled as C++.  Otherwise, if C is enabled globally, the  header
       is compiled as C. Otherwise, the header file is not compiled.

       If the header's <u>SKIP_LINTING</u> property is set to true, the file is not compiled.

       If  any  verification  targets are created, a top-level target called <b>all_verify_interface_header_sets</b> is
       created which depends on all verification targets.

       This property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS</u> variable if it is set
       when a target is created.

       If the project wishes  to  control  which  header  sets  are  verified  by  this  property,  it  can  set
       <u>INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS_TO_VERIFY</u>.

   <b>VERSION</b>
       Version number of a shared library target.

       For  shared  libraries  <b>VERSION</b>  and  <u>SOVERSION</u>  can be used to specify the build version and ABI version
       respectively.  When building or installing appropriate symlinks are  created  if  the  platform  supports
       symlinks  and  the  linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is specified the missing is assumed to
       have the same version number.  For executables <b>VERSION</b> can be used to specify the  build  version.   When
       building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks.

       A  common  convention  is  to  specify  both  <b>VERSION</b> and <b>SOVERSION</b> such that <b>SOVERSION</b> matches the first
       component of <b>VERSION</b>:

          set_target_properties(mylib PROPERTIES VERSION 1.2.3 SOVERSION 1)

       The idea is that breaking changes to the ABI increment both the <b>SOVERSION</b> and the major <b>VERSION</b> number.

   <b>Windows</b> <b>Versions</b>
       For shared  libraries  and  executables  on  Windows  the  <b>VERSION</b>  attribute  is  parsed  to  extract  a
       <b>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;</b> version number.  These numbers are used as the image version of the binary.

   <b>Mach-O</b> <b>Versions</b>
       For  shared  libraries  and  executables  on  Mach-O  systems  (e.g.  macOS, iOS), the <u>SOVERSION</u> property
       corresponds to the <u>compatibility</u> <u>version</u> and <b>VERSION</b> corresponds to the <u>current</u>  <u>version</u>  (unless  Mach-O
       specific overrides are provided, as discussed below).  See the <u>FRAMEWORK</u> target property for an example.

       For shared libraries, the <u>MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</u> and <u>MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION</u> properties can be used to
       override  the  <u>compatibility</u> <u>version</u> and <u>current</u> <u>version</u> respectively.  Note that <u>SOVERSION</u> will still be
       used to form the <b>install_name</b> and both <u>SOVERSION</u> and <b>VERSION</b> may also affect the file and symlink names.

       Versions of Mach-O binaries may be checked with the <b>otool</b> <b>-L</b> <b>&lt;binary&gt;</b> command.

   <b>VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN</b>
       Whether to add a compile flag to hide symbols of inline functions

       The <b>VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN</b> property determines whether a flag for hiding symbols for inline functions,
       such as <b>-fvisibility-inlines-hidden</b>, should be used when invoking the compiler.   This  property  affects
       compilation in sources of all types of targets (subject to policy <u>CMP0063</u>).

       This  property  is  initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN</u> variable if it is set
       when a target is created.

   <b>VS_CONFIGURATION_TYPE</b>
       Added in version 3.6.

       Visual Studio project configuration type.

       Sets the <b>ConfigurationType</b> attribute for a generated Visual Studio project.  The property value  may  use
       <u>generator</u>  <u>expressions</u>.   If  this property is set, it overrides the default setting that is based on the
       target type (e.g. <b>StaticLibrary</b>, <b>Application</b>, ...).

       Supported on <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> for VS 2010 and higher.

   <b>VS_DEBUGGER_COMMAND</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       Sets the local debugger command for Visual Studio C++ targets.  The  property  value  may  use  <u>generator</u>
       <u>expressions</u>.  This is defined in <b>&lt;LocalDebuggerCommand&gt;</b> in the Visual Studio project file.  This property
       is  initialized  by  the  value  of  the variable <u>CMAKE_VS_DEBUGGER_COMMAND</u> if it is set when a target is
       created.

       This property only works for <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>; it is ignored on other generators.

   <b>VS_DEBUGGER_COMMAND_ARGUMENTS</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       Sets the local debugger command line arguments for Visual Studio C++ targets.  The property value may use
       <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.  This is defined in <b>&lt;LocalDebuggerCommandArguments&gt;</b> in the Visual  Studio  project
       file.   This  property is initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_VS_DEBUGGER_COMMAND_ARGUMENTS</u> if
       it is set when a target is created.

       This property only works for <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>; it is ignored on other generators.

   <b>VS_DEBUGGER_ENVIRONMENT</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       Sets the local debugger environment for Visual Studio C++ targets.  The property value may use  <u>generator</u>
       <u>expressions</u>.   This  is  defined  in  <b>&lt;LocalDebuggerEnvironment&gt;</b> in the Visual Studio project file.  This
       property is initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_VS_DEBUGGER_ENVIRONMENT</u> if it is  set  when  a
       target is created.

       This property only works for <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>; it is ignored on other generators.

   <b>VS_DEBUGGER_WORKING_DIRECTORY</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Sets  the  local  debugger  working  directory for Visual Studio C++ targets.  The property value may use
       <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.  This is defined in <b>&lt;LocalDebuggerWorkingDirectory&gt;</b> in the Visual  Studio  project
       file.   This  property is initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_VS_DEBUGGER_WORKING_DIRECTORY</u> if
       it is set when a target is created.

       This property only works for <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>; it is ignored on other generators.

   <b>VS_DESKTOP_EXTENSIONS_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Visual Studio Windows 10 Desktop Extensions Version

       Specifies the version of the Desktop Extensions that should  be  included  in  the  target.  For  example
       <b>10.0.10240.0</b>. If the value is not specified, the Desktop Extensions will not be included. To use the same
       version   of   the   extensions   as   the   Windows  10  SDK  that  is  being  used,  you  can  use  the
       <u>CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION</u> variable.

   <b>VS_DOTNET_DOCUMENTATION_FILE</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       Visual Studio managed project .NET documentation output

       Sets the target XML documentation file output.

   <b>VS_DOTNET_REFERENCE_&lt;refname&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Visual Studio managed project .NET reference with name <b>&lt;refname&gt;</b> and hint path.

       Adds one .NET reference to generated Visual Studio project. The reference will have  the  name  <b>&lt;refname&gt;</b>
       and will point to the assembly given as value of the property.

       See also <u>VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES</u> and <u>VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES_COPY_LOCAL</u>

   <b>VS_DOTNET_REFERENCEPROP_&lt;refname&gt;_TAG_&lt;tagname&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       Defines an XML property <b>&lt;tagname&gt;</b> for a .NET reference <b>&lt;refname&gt;</b>.

       Reference  properties  can  be  set  for  .NET  references  which  are  defined  by the target properties
       <u>VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES</u>, <u>VS_DOTNET_REFERENCE_&lt;refname&gt;</u> and also for project references to other  C#  targets
       which are established by <u>target_link_libraries()</u>.

       This property is only applicable to C# targets and Visual Studio generators 2010 and later.

   <b>VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES</b>
       Visual Studio managed project .NET references

       Adds  one or more semicolon-delimited .NET references to a generated Visual Studio project.  For example,
       "System;System.Windows.Forms".

   <b>VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES_COPY_LOCAL</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Sets the <b>Copy</b> <b>Local</b> property for all .NET hint references in the target

       Boolean property to enable/disable copying of .NET hint references to output directory.  The  default  is
       <b>ON</b>.

   <b>VS_DOTNET_STARTUP_OBJECT</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       Sets  the  startup  object  property  in  Visual  Studio .NET targets.  The property value defines a full
       qualified class name (including package name), for example: <b>MyCompany.Package.MyStarterClass</b>.

       If the property is unset, Visual Studio uses the  first  matching  <b>static</b>  <b>void</b>  <b>Main(string[])</b>  function
       signature  by default. When more than one <b>Main()</b> method is available in the current project, the property
       becomes mandatory for building the project.

       This property only works for <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>; it is ignored on other generators.

          set_property(TARGET ${TARGET_NAME} PROPERTY
            VS_DOTNET_STARTUP_OBJECT "MyCompany.Package.MyStarterClass")

   <b>VS_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION</b>
       Specify the .NET target framework version.

       Used to specify the .NET target framework version for C++/CLI. For example, "v4.5".

       This  property  is  deprecated  and  should  not  be  used  anymore.   Use   <u>DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK</u>   or
       <u>DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION</u> instead.

   <b>VS_DPI_AWARE</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Set  the  Manifest  Tool  -&gt;  Input  and  Output  -&gt;  DPI  Awareness  in the Visual Studio target project
       properties.

       Valid values are <b>PerMonitor</b>, <b>ON</b>, or <b>OFF</b>.

       For example:

          add_executable(myproject myproject.cpp)
          set_property(TARGET myproject PROPERTY VS_DPI_AWARE "PerMonitor")

   <b>VS_FRAMEWORK_REFERENCES</b>
       Added in version 3.31.

       Visual Studio framework references.  Specify a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of  framework  references  to  be
       added to a generated Visual Studio project. For example:

       • "Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App.WPF" for WPF applications

       • "Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App.WindowsForms" for WinForms applications

       • "Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App" for applications using both frameworks

   <b>VS_GLOBAL_KEYWORD</b>
       Visual Studio project keyword.

       Sets  the  "keyword"  attribute for a generated Visual Studio project.  Defaults to "Win32Proj".  You may
       wish to override this value with "ManagedCProj", for example, in a Visual Studio managed  C++  unit  test
       project.

   <b>VS_GLOBAL_PROJECT_TYPES</b>
       Visual Studio project type(s).

       Can  be set to one or more UUIDs recognized by Visual Studio to indicate the type of project.  This value
       is copied verbatim into the generated project file.  Example for a managed C++ unit testing project:

          {3AC096D0-A1C2-E12C-1390-A8335801FDAB};{8BC9CEB8-8B4A-11D0-8D11-00A0C91BC942}

       UUIDs are semicolon-delimited.

   <b>VS_GLOBAL_ROOTNAMESPACE</b>
       Visual Studio project root namespace.

       Sets the "RootNamespace" attribute for  a  generated  Visual  Studio  project.   The  attribute  will  be
       generated only if this is set.

   <b>VS_GLOBAL_&lt;variable&gt;</b>
       Visual Studio project-specific global variable.

       Tell  the  Visual  Studio  generator  to  set  the  global  variable '&lt;variable&gt;' to a given value in the
       generated Visual  Studio  project.   Ignored  on  other  generators.   Qt  integration  works  better  if
       VS_GLOBAL_QtVersion is set to the version FindQt4.cmake found.  For example, "4.7.3"

   <b>VS_IOT_EXTENSIONS_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Visual Studio Windows 10 IoT Extensions Version

       Specifies  the  version  of  the  IoT  Extensions  that  should  be  included  in the target. For example
       <b>10.0.10240.0</b>. If the value is not specified, the IoT Extensions will not be included.  To  use  the  same
       version   of   the   extensions   as   the   Windows  10  SDK  that  is  being  used,  you  can  use  the
       <u>CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION</u> variable.

   <b>VS_IOT_STARTUP_TASK</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Visual Studio Windows 10 IoT Continuous Background Task

       Specifies that the target should be compiled as a Continuous Background Task library.

   <b>VS_JUST_MY_CODE_DEBUGGING</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       Enable Just My Code with Visual Studio debugger.

       Supported on <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>  for  VS  2010  and  higher,  <u>Makefile</u>  <u>Generators</u>  and  the  <u>Ninja</u>
       generators.

       This  property  is initialized by the <u>CMAKE_VS_JUST_MY_CODE_DEBUGGING</u> variable if it is set when a target
       is created.

   <b>VS_KEYWORD</b>
       Removed.  This once specified the Visual Studio project keyword for the <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>9</u>  <u>2008</u>  generator,
       and older, but all of those generators have been removed.

       Use the <u>VS_GLOBAL_KEYWORD</u> target property to set the keyword for remaining <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>.

   <b>VS_MOBILE_EXTENSIONS_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Visual Studio Windows 10 Mobile Extensions Version

       Specifies  the  version  of  the  Mobile  Extensions  that  should be included in the target. For example
       <b>10.0.10240.0</b>. If the value is not specified, the Mobile Extensions will not be included. To use the  same
       version   of   the   extensions   as   the   Windows  10  SDK  that  is  being  used,  you  can  use  the
       <u>CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION</u> variable.

   <b>VS_NO_COMPILE_BATCHING</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       Turn off compile batching for the target. Usually MSBuild calls the compiler with  multiple  c/cpp  files
       and  compiler  starts  subprocesses  for each file to make the build parallel. If you want compiler to be
       invoked with one file at a time set <b>VS_NO_COMPILE_BATCHING</b> to ON. If this flag is set MSBuild  will  call
       compiler  with one c/cpp file at a time. Useful when you want to use tool that replaces the compiler, for
       example some build caching tool.

       This property is initialized by the <u>CMAKE_VS_NO_COMPILE_BATCHING</u> variable if it is set when a  target  is
       created.

   <b>Example</b>
       This shows setting the property for the target <b>foo</b>.

          add_library(foo SHARED foo.cpp)
          set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY VS_NO_COMPILE_BATCHING ON)

   <b>VS_NO_SOLUTION_DEPLOY</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       Specify  that  the  target should not be marked for deployment to a Windows CE or Windows Phone device in
       the generated Visual Studio solution.

       Be default, all EXE and shared library (DLL) targets are marked to deploy to the  target  device  in  the
       generated Visual Studio solution.

       Generator expressions are supported.

       There are reasons one might want to exclude a target / generated project from deployment:

       • The library or executable may not be necessary in the primary deploy/debug scenario, and excluding from
         deployment saves time in the develop/download/debug cycle.

       • There may be insufficient space on the target device to accommodate all of the build products.

       • Visual  Studio  2013  requires  a  target  device  IP  address  be  entered  for each target marked for
         deployment.  For large numbers of targets, this can be tedious.  NOTE: Visual Studio  <u>will</u>  deploy  all
         project  dependencies  of a project tagged for deployment to the IP address configured for that project
         even if those dependencies are not tagged for deployment.

   <b>Example</b> <b>1</b>
       This shows setting the variable for the target foo.

          add_library(foo SHARED foo.cpp)
          set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY VS_NO_SOLUTION_DEPLOY ON)

   <b>Example</b> <b>2</b>
       This shows setting the variable for the Release configuration only.

          add_library(foo SHARED foo.cpp)
          set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY VS_NO_SOLUTION_DEPLOY "$&lt;CONFIG:Release&gt;")

   <b>VS_PACKAGE_REFERENCES</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       Visual Studio package references for nuget.

       Adds one or more semicolon-delimited package references to a generated Visual Studio project. The version
       of the package will be underscore delimited. For example, <b>boost_1.7.0;nunit_3.12.*</b>.

          set_property(TARGET ${TARGET_NAME} PROPERTY
            VS_PACKAGE_REFERENCES "boost_1.7.0")

   <b>VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       Overrides the platform toolset used to build a target.

       Only supported when the compiler used by the given toolset is the same as the compiler used to build  the
       whole source tree.

       This  is  especially  useful  to  create driver projects with the toolsets "WindowsUserModeDriver10.0" or
       "WindowsKernelModeDriver10.0".

   <b>VS_PROJECT_IMPORT</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       Visual Studio managed project imports

       Adds to a generated Visual Studio project one or more semicolon-delimited paths to  .props  files  needed
       when       building       projects       from      some      NuGet      packages.       For      example,
       <b>my_packages_path/MyPackage.1.0.0/build/MyPackage.props</b>.

   <b>VS_SCC_AUXPATH</b>
       Visual Studio Source Code Control Aux Path.

       Can be set to change the visual studio source code control auxpath property.

   <b>VS_SCC_LOCALPATH</b>
       Visual Studio Source Code Control Local Path.

       Can be set to change the visual studio source code control local path property.

   <b>VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME</b>
       Visual Studio Source Code Control Project.

       Can be set to change the visual studio source code control project name property.

   <b>VS_SCC_PROVIDER</b>
       Visual Studio Source Code Control Provider.

       Can be set to change the visual studio source code control provider property.

   <b>VS_SDK_REFERENCES</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Visual Studio project SDK references.  Specify a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of SDK references to  be  added
       to a generated Visual Studio project, e.g.  <b>Microsoft.AdMediatorWindows81,</b> <b>Version=1.0</b>.

   <b>VS_SOLUTION_DEPLOY</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       Specify that the target should be marked for deployment when not targeting Windows CE, Windows Phone or a
       Windows Store application.

       If the target platform doesn't support deployment, this property won't have any effect.

       <u>Generator</u> <u>expressions</u> are supported.

   <b>Examples</b>
       Always deploy target <b>foo</b>:

          add_executable(foo SHARED foo.cpp)
          set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY VS_SOLUTION_DEPLOY ON)

       Deploy target <b>foo</b> for all configurations except <b>Release</b>:

          add_executable(foo SHARED foo.cpp)
          set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY VS_SOLUTION_DEPLOY "$&lt;NOT:$&lt;CONFIG:Release&gt;&gt;")

   <b>VS_SOURCE_SETTINGS_&lt;tool&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       Set any item metadata on all non-built files that use &lt;tool&gt;.

       Takes  a  list of <b>Key=Value</b> pairs. Tells the Visual Studio generator to set <b>Key</b> to <b>Value</b> as item metadata
       on all non-built files that use <b>&lt;tool&gt;</b>.

       For example:

          set_property(TARGET main PROPERTY VS_SOURCE_SETTINGS_FXCompile "Key=Value" "Key2=Value2")

       will set <b>Key</b> to <b>Value</b> and <b>Key2</b> to <b>Value2</b> for all non-built files that use <b>FXCompile</b>.

       <u>Generator</u> <u>expressions</u> are supported.

   <b>VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES</b>
       Added in version 3.30.

       Indicate to <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> what  configurations  are  considered  debug  configurations.   This
       controls the <b>UseDebugLibraries</b> setting in each configuration of a <b>.vcxproj</b> file.

       The  "Use  Debug  Libraries"  setting in Visual Studio projects, despite its specific-sounding name, is a
       general-purpose indicator of what configurations are  considered  debug  configurations.   In  standalone
       projects,  this  may  affect  MSBuild's  default  selection  of MSVC runtime library, optimization flags,
       runtime checks, and  similar  settings.   In  CMake  projects  those  settings  are  typically  generated
       explicitly  based  on  the  project's  specification,  e.g.,  the  MSVC  runtime library is controlled by
       <u>MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</u>.  However, the <b>UseDebugLibraries</b> indicator is useful for reference  by  both  humans
       and tools, and may also affect the behavior of platform-specific SDKs.

       Set  <b>VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES</b> to a true or false value to indicate whether each configuration is considered
       a debug configuration.  The value may also be the empty string (<b>""</b>) in which  case  no  <b>UseDebugLibraries</b>
       will be added explicitly by CMake, and MSBuild will use its default value, <b>false</b>.

       Use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> for per-configuration specification.  For example, the code:

          add_executable(foo foo.c)
          set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY
            VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES "$&lt;CONFIG:Debug,Custom&gt;")

       indicates  that  target <b>foo</b> considers its "Debug" and "Custom" configurations to be debug configurations,
       and its other configurations to be non-debug configurations.

       The property is initialized from the value of the <u>CMAKE_VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES</u> variable, if  it  is  set.
       If  the  property  is  not set then CMake generates <b>UseDebugLibraries</b> using heuristics to determine which
       configurations are debug configurations.  See policy <u>CMP0162</u>.

   <b>VS_USER_PROPS</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Sets the user props file to be included in the visual studio C++  project  file.  The  standard  path  is
       <b>$(UserRootDir)\\Microsoft.Cpp.$(Platform).user.props</b>,    which   is   in   most   cases   the   same   as
       <b>%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\MSBuild\\v4.0\\Microsoft.Cpp.Win32.user.props</b>                               or
       <b>%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\MSBuild\\v4.0\\Microsoft.Cpp.x64.user.props</b>.

       The <b>*.user.props</b> files can be used for Visual Studio wide configuration which is independent from cmake.

   <b>VS_FILTER_PROPS</b>
       Added in version 3.30.

       Sets the filter props file to be included in the visual studio C++ project filter file.

       The  <b>*.filter.props</b>  files  can  be  used  for Visual Studio wide configuration which is independent from
       cmake.

   <b>VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_MIN_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Visual Studio Windows Target Platform Minimum Version

       For Windows 10. Specifies the minimum version of the OS that is being targeted. For example <b>10.0.10240.0</b>.
       If the value is not specified, the value of the <u>CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION</u> variable will be
       used on WindowsStore projects.  Otherwise the target platform minimum version will not be  specified  for
       the project.

       Added    in    version    3.27:    This    property    is    initialized    by    the    value   of   the
       <u>CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_MIN_VERSION</u> variable if it is set when a target is created.

   <b>VS_WINRT_COMPONENT</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Mark a target as a Windows Runtime component for the Visual Studio generator.  Compile  the  target  with
       <b>C++/CX</b>  language  extensions for Windows Runtime.  For <b>SHARED</b> and <b>MODULE</b> libraries, this also defines the
       <b>_WINRT_DLL</b> preprocessor macro.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Currently this is implemented only by Visual  Studio  generators.   Support  may  be  added  to  other
          generators in the future.

   <b>VS_WINRT_REFERENCES</b>
       Visual Studio project Windows Runtime Metadata references

       Adds one or more semicolon-delimited WinRT references to a generated Visual Studio project.  For example,
       "Windows;Windows.UI.Core".

   <b>WATCOM_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       Select the Watcom runtime library for use by compilers targeting the Watcom ABI.

       The allowed values are:

       <b>SingleThreaded</b>
              Compile without additional flags to use a single-threaded statically-linked runtime library.

       <b>SingleThreadedDLL</b>
              Compile  with  <b>-br</b>  or  equivalent  flag(s)  to  use  a single-threaded dynamically-linked runtime
              library. This is not available for Linux targets.

       <b>MultiThreaded</b>
              Compile with <b>-bm</b> or equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded statically-linked runtime library.

       <b>MultiThreadedDLL</b>
              Compile with <b>-bm</b> <b>-br</b> or equivalent flag(s) to  use  a  multi-threaded  dynamically-linked  runtime
              library. This is not available for Linux targets.

       The  value  is ignored on non-Watcom compilers but an unsupported value will be rejected as an error when
       using a compiler targeting the Watcom ABI.

       The value may also be the empty string (<b>""</b>) in which case no runtime library selection flag will be added
       explicitly by CMake.

       Use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> to support per-configuration specification.

       For example, the code:

          add_executable(foo foo.c)
          set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY
            WATCOM_RUNTIME_LIBRARY "MultiThreaded")

       selects for the target <b>foo</b> a multi-threaded statically-linked runtime library.

       If this property is  not  set  then  CMake  uses  the  default  value  <b>MultiThreadedDLL</b>  on  Windows  and
       <b>SingleThreaded</b> on other platforms to select a Watcom runtime library.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This  property  has  effect  only  when  policy  <u>CMP0136</u> is set to <b>NEW</b> prior to the first <u>project()</u> or
          <u>enable_language()</u> command that enables a language using a compiler targeting the Watcom ABI.

   <b>WIN32_EXECUTABLE</b>
       Build an executable with a WinMain entry point on windows.

       When this property is set to true the executable when linked on Windows will be created with a  WinMain()
       entry  point  instead  of  just main().  This makes it a GUI executable instead of a console application.
       See the <u>CMAKE_MFC_FLAG</u> variable documentation to configure use of the Microsoft Foundation Classes  (MFC)
       for  WinMain  executables.   This  property  is  initialized  by  the value of the <u>CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE</u>
       variable if it is set when a target is created.

       This property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>, except if the target is managed (contains C# code.)

   <b>WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       This property is implemented only for MS-compatible tools on Windows.

       Enable this boolean property to automatically create a module definition  (<b>.def</b>)  file  with  all  global
       symbols  found  in  the  input  <b>.obj</b>  files  for  a <b>SHARED</b> library (or executable with <u>ENABLE_EXPORTS</u>) on
       Windows.  The module definition file will be passed to the linker causing all symbols to be exported from
       the <b>.dll</b>.  For global <u>data</u> symbols, <b>__declspec(dllimport)</b> must still be used when compiling  against  the
       code  in  the  <b>.dll</b>.   All other function symbols will be automatically exported and imported by callers.
       This simplifies porting projects to Windows by reducing the need for explicit <b>dllexport</b> markup,  even  in
       <b>C++</b> classes.

       When  this  property  is  enabled,  zero  or more <b>.def</b> files may also be specified as source files of the
       target.  The exports named by these files will be merged with those detected from  the  object  files  to
       generate  a single module definition file to be passed to the linker.  This can be used to export symbols
       from a <b>.dll</b> that are not in any of its object files but are added by the linker from  dependencies  (e.g.
       <b>msvcrt.lib</b>).

       This  property  is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS</u> variable if it is set
       when a target is created.

   <b>XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt;</b>
       Set Xcode target attributes directly.

       Tell the <u>Xcode</u> generator to set <b>&lt;an-attribute&gt;</b> to a given value in the generated Xcode project.   Ignored
       on other generators.

       This  offers  low-level  control over the generated Xcode project file.  It is meant as a last resort for
       specifying settings that CMake does not otherwise have a way to control.  Although this  can  override  a
       setting  CMake normally produces on its own, doing so bypasses CMake's model of the project and can break
       things.

       See the <u>CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt;</u> variable to set attributes on all  targets  in  a  directory
       tree.

       Contents  of  <b>XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt;</b> may use "generator expressions" with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See
       the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual
       for more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>XCODE_EMBED_FRAMEWORKS_CODE_SIGN_ON_COPY</b>
       Added in version 3.20.

       Tell the <u>Xcode</u> generator to perform code signing for all the frameworks and libraries that  are  embedded
       using the <u>XCODE_EMBED_FRAMEWORKS</u> property.

       Added in version 3.21.

       This property was generalized to other types of embedded items.  See <u>XCODE_EMBED_&lt;type&gt;_CODE_SIGN_ON_COPY</u>
       for the more general form.

   <b>XCODE_EMBED_FRAMEWORKS_REMOVE_HEADERS_ON_COPY</b>
       Added in version 3.20.

       Tell  the  <u>Xcode</u>  generator  to  remove  headers  from  all  the  frameworks  that are embedded using the
       <u>XCODE_EMBED_FRAMEWORKS</u> property.

       Added in version 3.21.

       This    property    was    generalized     to     other     types     of     embedded     items.      See
       <u>XCODE_EMBED_&lt;type&gt;_REMOVE_HEADERS_ON_COPY</u> for the more general form.

   <b>XCODE_EMBED_&lt;type&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.20.

       Tell  the  <u>Xcode</u> generator to embed the specified list of items into the target bundle.  <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> specifies
       the embed build phase to use.  See the Xcode documentation for the base location of each <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>.

       The supported values for <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> are:

       <b>FRAMEWORKS</b>
              The specified items will be added to the <b>Embed</b> <b>Frameworks</b> build phase.  The  items  can  be  CMake
              target names or paths to frameworks or libraries.

       <b>APP_EXTENSIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              The specified items will be added to the <b>Embed</b> <b>App</b> <b>Extensions</b> build phase, with <b>Destination</b> set to
              <b>PlugIns</b> <b>and</b> <b>Foundation</b> <b>Extensions</b> They must be CMake target names.

       <b>EXTENSIONKIT_EXTENSIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.26.

              The specified items will be added to the <b>Embed</b> <b>App</b> <b>Extensions</b> build phase, with <b>Destination</b> set to
              <b>ExtensionKit</b>   <b>Extensions</b>   They   must  be  CMake  target  names,  and  should  likely  have  the
              <b>XCODE_PRODUCT_TYPE</b> target property set to <b>com.apple.product-type.extensionkit-extension</b> as well as
              the  <b>XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE</b> to <b>wrapper.extensionkit-extension</b>

       <b>PLUGINS</b>
              Added in version 3.23.

              The specified items will be added to the <b>Embed</b> <b>PlugIns</b> build phase.  They  must  be  CMake  target
              names.

       <b>RESOURCES</b>
              Added in version 3.28.

              The  specified  items will be added to the <b>Embed</b> <b>Resources</b> build phase.  They must be CMake target
              names or folder paths.

       <b>XPC_SERVICES</b>
              Added in version 3.29.

              The specified items will be added to the <b>Embed</b> <b>XPC</b> <b>Services</b>  build  phase.   They  must  be  CMake
              target names.

       When listing a target as any of the things to embed, Xcode must see that target as part of the same Xcode
       project, or a sub-project of the one defining the bundle.  In order to satisfy this constraint, the CMake
       project must ensure at least one of the following:

       • The <u>CMAKE_XCODE_GENERATE_TOP_LEVEL_PROJECT_ONLY</u> variable is set to true in the top level <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>
         file.  This is the simplest and most robust approach.

       • Define the target-to-embed in a subdirectory of the one that defines the target being embedded into.

       • If  the target-to-embed and the target being embedded into are in separate, unrelated directories (i.e.
         they are siblings, not one a parent of the other), ensure they have a common <u>project()</u> call in a parent
         directory and no other <u>project()</u> calls between themselves and that common <u>project()</u> call.

       See       also       <u>XCODE_EMBED_&lt;type&gt;_PATH</u>,        <u>XCODE_EMBED_&lt;type&gt;_REMOVE_HEADERS_ON_COPY</u>        and
       <u>XCODE_EMBED_&lt;type&gt;_CODE_SIGN_ON_COPY</u>.

   <b>XCODE_EMBED_&lt;type&gt;_CODE_SIGN_ON_COPY</b>
       Added in version 3.20.

       Boolean  property used only by the <u>Xcode</u> generator.  It specifies whether to perform code signing for the
       items that are embedded using the <u>XCODE_EMBED_&lt;type&gt;</u> property.

       The supported values for <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> are:

       <b>FRAMEWORKS</b>

       <b>APP_EXTENSIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

       <b>EXTENSIONKIT_EXTENSIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.26.

       <b>PLUGINS</b>
              Added in version 3.23.

       If a <b>XCODE_EMBED_&lt;type&gt;_CODE_SIGN_ON_COPY</b> property is not defined on the target, no code signing on  copy
       will be performed for that <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>.

   <b>XCODE_EMBED_&lt;type&gt;_PATH</b>
       Added in version 3.20.

       This  property  is used only by the <u>Xcode</u> generator.  When defined, it specifies the relative path to use
       when embedding the items specified by <u>XCODE_EMBED_&lt;type&gt;</u>.  The path is relative to the base  location  of
       the  <b>Embed</b>  <b>XXX</b> build phase associated with <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>.  See the Xcode documentation for the base location of
       each <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>.

              Added in version 3.29.

   <b>XCODE_EMBED_&lt;type&gt;_REMOVE_HEADERS_ON_COPY</b>
       Added in version 3.20.

       Boolean property used only by the <u>Xcode</u> generator.  It specifies whether to remove headers from  all  the
       frameworks that are embedded using the <u>XCODE_EMBED_&lt;type&gt;</u> property.

       The supported values for <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> are:

       <b>FRAMEWORKS</b>
              If  the <b>XCODE_EMBED_FRAMEWORKS_REMOVE_HEADERS_ON_COPY</b> property is not defined, headers will not be
              removed on copy by default.

       <b>APP_EXTENSIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              If the <b>XCODE_EMBED_APP_EXTENSIONS_REMOVE_HEADERS_ON_COPY</b> property is not defined, headers WILL  be
              removed on copy by default.

       <b>EXTENSIONKIT_EXTENSIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.26.

              If  the <b>XCODE_EMBED_APP_EXTENSIONS_REMOVE_HEADERS_ON_COPY</b> property is not defined, headers WILL be

       <b>PLUGINS</b>
              Added in version 3.23.

   <b>XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Set the Xcode <b>explicitFileType</b> attribute on its reference to a target.  CMake computes a default based on
       target type but can be told explicitly with this property.

       See also <u>XCODE_PRODUCT_TYPE</u>.

   <b>XCODE_GENERATE_SCHEME</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       If enabled, the <u>Xcode</u> generator will generate schema files.  These are useful to invoke analyze, archive,
       build-for-testing and test actions from the command line.

       This property is initialized by the value of the variable <u>CMAKE_XCODE_GENERATE_SCHEME</u> if it is set when a
       target is created.

       The following target properties overwrite the default of the corresponding settings on  the  "Diagnostic"
       tab  for  each  schema  file.   Each  of those is initialized by the respective <b>CMAKE_</b> variable at target
       creation time.

       • <u>XCODE_SCHEME_WORKING_DIRECTORY</u>

   <b>XCODE_LINK_BUILD_PHASE_MODE</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       When using the <u>Xcode</u> generator, libraries to be linked will be specified in the Xcode project file  using
       either the "Link Binary With Libraries" build phase or directly as linker flags.  The former allows Xcode
       to  manage  build paths, which may be necessary when creating Xcode archives because it may use different
       build paths to a regular build.

       This property controls usage of "Link Binary With Libraries" build phase for a  target  that  is  an  app
       bundle, executable, shared library, shared framework or a module library.

       Possible values are:

       • <b>NONE</b> The libraries will be linked by specifying the linker flags directly.

       • <b>BUILT_ONLY</b>  The  "Link  Binary With Libraries" build phase will be used to link to another target under
         the following conditions:

         • The target to be linked to is a regular non-imported, non-interface library target.

         • The output directory of  the  target  being  built  has  not  been  changed  from  its  default  (see
           <u>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u> and <u>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u>).

       • <b>KNOWN_LOCATION</b>  The  "Link  Binary  With  Libraries" build phase will be used to link to another target
         under the same conditions as with <b>BUILT_ONLY</b> and also:

         • Imported library targets except those of type <b>UNKNOWN</b>.

         • Any non-target library specified directly with a path.

       For all other cases, the libraries will be linked by specifying the linker flags directly.

       <b>WARNING:</b>
          Libraries linked using "Link Binary With Libraries" are linked after the ones linked  through  regular
          linker flags.  This order should be taken into account when different static libraries contain symbols
          with the same name, as the former ones will take precedence over the latter.

       <b>WARNING:</b>
          If  two  or more directories contain libraries with identical file names and some libraries are linked
          from those directories, the library search path lookup will end up linking libraries  from  the  first
          directory.  This is a known limitation of Xcode.

       This  property is initialized by the value of the <u>CMAKE_XCODE_LINK_BUILD_PHASE_MODE</u> variable if it is set
       when a target is created.

   <b>XCODE_PRODUCT_TYPE</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Set the Xcode <b>productType</b> attribute on its reference to a target.  CMake  computes  a  default  based  on
       target type but can be told explicitly with this property.

       See also <u>XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE</u>.

   <b>XCODE_XCCONFIG</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       If  set, the <u>Xcode</u> generator will register the specified file as a target-level XCConfig file. For global
       XCConfig files see the <u>CMAKE_XCODE_XCCONFIG</u> variable.

       This feature is intended to ease migration from native Xcode projects to CMake projects.

       Contents of <b>XCODE_XCCONFIG</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

   <b>XCTEST</b>
       Added in version 3.3.

       This target is a XCTest CFBundle on the Mac.

       This property will usually get set via the <u>xctest_add_bundle()</u> macro in <u>FindXCTest</u> module.

       If a module library target has this property set to true it will be built as a CFBundle when built on the
       Mac.  It will have the directory structure required for a CFBundle.

       This property depends on <u>BUNDLE</u> to be effective.

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>TESTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ATTACHED_FILES</b>
       Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission.

       Set this property to a list of files that will be encoded and submitted to the dashboard as  an  addition
       to the test result.

   <b>ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL</b>
       Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission if the test fails.

       Same as <u>ATTACHED_FILES</u>, but these files will only be included if the test does not pass.

   <b>COST</b>
       This property describes the cost of a test.  When parallel testing is enabled, tests in the test set will
       be  run  in  descending order of cost.  Projects can explicitly define the cost of a test by setting this
       property to a floating point value.

       When the cost of a test is not defined by the project, <u>ctest</u> will initially use a default cost of <b>0</b>.   It
       computes  a weighted average of the cost each time a test is run and uses that as an improved estimate of
       the cost for the next  run.   The  more  a  test  is  re-run  in  the  same  build  directory,  the  more
       representative the cost should become.

   <b>DEPENDS</b>
       Specifies that this test should only be run after the specified list of tests.

       Set  this to a list of tests that must finish before this test is run. The results of those tests are not
       considered, the dependency relationship is purely for order of execution (i.e. it is really  just  a  <u>run</u>
       <u>after</u>  relationship).  Consider  using  test  fixtures  with  setup tests if a dependency with successful
       completion is required (see <u>FIXTURES_REQUIRED</u>).

   <b>Examples</b>
          add_test(NAME baseTest1 ...)
          add_test(NAME baseTest2 ...)
          add_test(NAME dependsTest12 ...)

          set_tests_properties(dependsTest12 PROPERTIES DEPENDS "baseTest1;baseTest2")
          # dependsTest12 runs after baseTest1 and baseTest2, even if they fail

   <b>DISABLED</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       If set to <b>True</b>, the test will be skipped and its status will be 'Not Run'. A <b>DISABLED</b> test  will  not  be
       counted in the total number of tests and its completion status will be reported to CDash as <b>Disabled</b>.

       A  <b>DISABLED</b>  test  does  not  participate  in test fixture dependency resolution.  If a <b>DISABLED</b> test has
       fixture requirements defined in its <u>FIXTURES_REQUIRED</u> property, it will not cause setup or cleanup  tests
       for those fixtures to be added to the test set.

       If  a  test with the <u>FIXTURES_SETUP</u> property set is <b>DISABLED</b>, the fixture behavior will be as though that
       setup test was passing and any test case requiring that fixture will still run.

   <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
       Specify environment variables that should be defined for running a test.

       Set to a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> list of environment variables  and  values  of  the  form  <b>MYVAR=value</b>.
       Those  environment  variables  will be defined while running the test.  The environment changes from this
       property do not affect other tests.

   <b>ENVIRONMENT_MODIFICATION</b>
       Added in version 3.22.

       Specify environment variables that should be modified for  running  a  test.  Note  that  the  operations
       performed by this property are performed after the <u>ENVIRONMENT</u> property is already applied.

       Set  to  a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of environment variables and values of the form <b>MYVAR=OP:VALUE</b>, where
       <b>MYVAR</b> is the case-sensitive name of an environment variable to be modified.  Entries  are  considered  in
       the order specified in the property's value.  The <b>OP</b> may be one of:

          • <b>reset</b>:  Reset to the unmodified value, ignoring all modifications to <b>MYVAR</b> prior to this entry. Note
            that this will reset the variable to the value set by <u>ENVIRONMENT</u>, if it was set, and  otherwise  to
            its state from the rest of the CTest execution.

          • <b>set</b>: Replaces the current value of <b>MYVAR</b> with <b>VALUE</b>.

          • <b>unset</b>: Unsets the current value of <b>MYVAR</b>.

          • <b>string_append</b>: Appends singular <b>VALUE</b> to the current value of <b>MYVAR</b>.

          • <b>string_prepend</b>: Prepends singular <b>VALUE</b> to the current value of <b>MYVAR</b>.

          • <b>path_list_append</b>:  Appends  singular  <b>VALUE</b>  to the current value of <b>MYVAR</b> using the host platform's
            path list separator (<b>;</b> on Windows and <b>:</b> elsewhere).

          • <b>path_list_prepend</b>: Prepends singular <b>VALUE</b> to the current value of <b>MYVAR</b> using the  host  platform's
            path list separator (<b>;</b> on Windows and <b>:</b> elsewhere).

          • <b>cmake_list_append</b>: Appends singular <b>VALUE</b> to the current value of <b>MYVAR</b> using <b>;</b> as the separator.

          • <b>cmake_list_prepend</b>: Prepends singular <b>VALUE</b> to the current value of <b>MYVAR</b> using <b>;</b> as the separator.

       Unrecognized  <b>OP</b>  values  will  result  in the test failing before it is executed. This is so that future
       operations may be added without changing valid behavior of existing tests.

       The environment changes from this property do not affect other tests.

   <b>FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</b>
       If the test output (stdout or stderr) matches this regular expression the test will fail,  regardless  of
       the  process  exit  code.  Tests  that  exceed  the  timeout  specified  by  <u>TIMEOUT</u>  fail  regardless of
       <b>FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</b>. Any non-zero return code or system-level test  failures  including  segmentation
       faults, signal abort, or heap errors fail the test even if the regular expression does not match.

       If set, if the output matches one of specified regular expressions, the test will fail.  Example:

          # test would pass, except for FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
          add_test(NAME mytest COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "Failed")

          set_property(TEST mytest PROPERTY
            FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed"
          )

       <b>FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</b> expects a list of regular expressions.

       See also the <u>PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</u> and <u>SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</u> test properties.

   <b>FIXTURES_CLEANUP</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Specifies  a  list of fixtures for which the test is to be treated as a cleanup test. These fixture names
       are distinct from test case names and are not required to have any  similarity  to  the  names  of  tests
       associated with them.

       Fixture  cleanup  tests  are  ordinary  tests  with  all  of  the  usual  test functionality. Setting the
       <b>FIXTURES_CLEANUP</b> property for a test has two primary effects:

       • CTest will ensure the test executes after all other tests  which  list  any  of  the  fixtures  in  its
         <u>FIXTURES_REQUIRED</u> property.

       • If  CTest  is asked to run only a subset of tests (e.g. using regular expressions or the <b>--rerun-failed</b>
         option) and the cleanup test is not in the set of tests to run, it will automatically be added  if  any
         tests in the set require any fixture listed in <b>FIXTURES_CLEANUP</b>.

       A  cleanup  test can have multiple fixtures listed in its <b>FIXTURES_CLEANUP</b> property. It will execute only
       once for the whole CTest run, not once for each fixture. A fixture can also have more  than  one  cleanup
       test  defined.  If  there are multiple cleanup tests for a fixture, projects can control their order with
       the usual <u>DEPENDS</u> test property if necessary.

       A cleanup test is allowed to require other fixtures, but not any fixture listed in  its  <b>FIXTURES_CLEANUP</b>
       property. For example:

          # Ok: Dependent fixture is different to cleanup
          set_tests_properties(cleanupFoo PROPERTIES
            FIXTURES_CLEANUP  Foo
            FIXTURES_REQUIRED Bar
          )

          # Error: cannot require same fixture as cleanup
          set_tests_properties(cleanupFoo PROPERTIES
            FIXTURES_CLEANUP  Foo
            FIXTURES_REQUIRED Foo
          )

       Cleanup tests will execute even if setup or regular tests for that fixture fail or are skipped.

       See <u>FIXTURES_REQUIRED</u> for a more complete discussion of how to use test fixtures.

   <b>FIXTURES_REQUIRED</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Specifies  a  list  of  fixtures  the  test  requires.  Fixture names are case sensitive and they are not
       required to have any similarity to test names.

       Fixtures are a way to attach setup and cleanup tasks to a set of  tests.  If  a  test  requires  a  given
       fixture, then all tests marked as setup tasks for that fixture will be executed first (once for the whole
       set  of  tests,  not once per test requiring the fixture). After all tests requiring a particular fixture
       have completed, CTest will ensure all tests marked as cleanup tasks for that fixture are  then  executed.
       Tests  are  marked  as  setup  tasks  with  the  <u>FIXTURES_SETUP</u>  property  and  as cleanup tasks with the
       <u>FIXTURES_CLEANUP</u> property. If any of a fixture's setup tests fail, all  tests  listing  that  fixture  in
       their  <b>FIXTURES_REQUIRED</b>  property will not be executed. The cleanup tests for the fixture will always be
       executed, even if some setup tests fail.

       When CTest is asked to execute only a subset of tests (e.g. by the use of regular expressions or when run
       with the <u>--rerun-failed</u> command line option), it will automatically add any setup or  cleanup  tests  for
       fixtures required by any of the tests that are in the execution set. This behavior can be overridden with
       the <u>-FS</u>, <u>-FC</u> and <u>-FA</u> command line options to <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> if desired.

       Since  setup  and  cleanup  tasks are also tests, they can have an ordering specified by the <u>DEPENDS</u> test
       property just like any other tests.  This can be exploited to implement setup or cleanup  using  multiple
       tests for a single fixture to modularise setup or cleanup logic.

       The  concept  of a fixture is different to that of a resource specified by <u>RESOURCE_LOCK</u>, but they may be
       used together. A fixture defines a set of tests which share setup and  cleanup  requirements,  whereas  a
       resource  lock  has  the  effect  of  ensuring  a  particular  set  of tests do not run in parallel. Some
       situations may need both, such as setting up a database, serializing test access  to  that  database  and
       deleting  the  database again at the end. For such cases, tests would populate both <b>FIXTURES_REQUIRED</b> and
       <u>RESOURCE_LOCK</u> to combine the two behaviors. Names used for <u>RESOURCE_LOCK</u> have no relationship with  names
       of fixtures, so note that a resource lock does not imply a fixture and vice versa.

       Consider the following example which represents a database test scenario similar to that mentioned above:

          add_test(NAME testsDone   COMMAND emailResults)
          add_test(NAME fooOnly     COMMAND testFoo)
          add_test(NAME dbOnly      COMMAND testDb)
          add_test(NAME dbWithFoo   COMMAND testDbWithFoo)
          add_test(NAME createDB    COMMAND initDB)
          add_test(NAME setupUsers  COMMAND userCreation)
          add_test(NAME cleanupDB   COMMAND deleteDB)
          add_test(NAME cleanupFoo  COMMAND removeFoos)

          set_tests_properties(setupUsers PROPERTIES DEPENDS createDB)

          set_tests_properties(createDB   PROPERTIES FIXTURES_SETUP    DB)
          set_tests_properties(setupUsers PROPERTIES FIXTURES_SETUP    DB)
          set_tests_properties(cleanupDB  PROPERTIES FIXTURES_CLEANUP  DB)
          set_tests_properties(cleanupFoo PROPERTIES FIXTURES_CLEANUP  Foo)
          set_tests_properties(testsDone  PROPERTIES FIXTURES_CLEANUP  "DB;Foo")

          set_tests_properties(fooOnly    PROPERTIES FIXTURES_REQUIRED Foo)
          set_tests_properties(dbOnly     PROPERTIES FIXTURES_REQUIRED DB)
          set_tests_properties(dbWithFoo  PROPERTIES FIXTURES_REQUIRED "DB;Foo")

          set_tests_properties(dbOnly dbWithFoo createDB setupUsers cleanupDB
                               PROPERTIES RESOURCE_LOCK DbAccess)

       Key points from this example:

       • Two  fixtures  are defined: <b>DB</b> and <b>Foo</b>. Tests can require a single fixture as <b>fooOnly</b> and <b>dbOnly</b> do, or
         they can depend on multiple fixtures like <b>dbWithFoo</b> does.

       • A <b>DEPENDS</b> relationship is set up to ensure <b>setupUsers</b> happens after <b>createDB</b>, both of which  are  setup
         tests  for  the  <b>DB</b>  fixture  and  will  therefore  be  executed  before the <b>dbOnly</b> and <b>dbWithFoo</b> tests
         automatically.

       • No explicit <b>DEPENDS</b> relationships were needed to make the setup tests run before or the  cleanup  tests
         run after the regular tests.

       • The <b>Foo</b> fixture has no setup tests defined, only a single cleanup test.

       • <b>testsDone</b>  is  a  cleanup  test for both the <b>DB</b> and <b>Foo</b> fixtures.  Therefore, it will only execute once
         regular tests for both fixtures have finished (i.e. after <b>fooOnly</b>, <b>dbOnly</b> and  <b>dbWithFoo</b>).  No  <b>DEPENDS</b>
         relationship was specified for <b>testsDone</b>, so it is free to run before, after or concurrently with other
         cleanup tests for either fixture.

       • The  setup  and  cleanup  tests  never  list  the  fixtures they are for in their own <b>FIXTURES_REQUIRED</b>
         property, as that would result in a dependency on themselves and be considered an error.

   <b>FIXTURES_SETUP</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Specifies a list of fixtures for which the test is to be treated as a setup test. These fixture names are
       distinct from test case names and are not  required  to  have  any  similarity  to  the  names  of  tests
       associated with them.

       Fixture  setup  tests  are  ordinary  tests  with  all  of  the  usual  test  functionality.  Setting the
       <b>FIXTURES_SETUP</b> property for a test has two primary effects:

       • CTest will ensure the test executes before any other test  which  lists  the  fixture  name(s)  in  its
         <u>FIXTURES_REQUIRED</u> property.

       • If  CTest  is asked to run only a subset of tests (e.g. using regular expressions or the <b>--rerun-failed</b>
         option) and the setup test is not in the set of tests to run, it will automatically  be  added  if  any
         tests in the set require any fixture listed in <b>FIXTURES_SETUP</b>.

       A  setup test can have multiple fixtures listed in its <b>FIXTURES_SETUP</b> property. It will execute only once
       for the whole CTest run, not once for each fixture. A fixture can also have  more  than  one  setup  test
       defined. If there are multiple setup tests for a fixture, projects can control their order with the usual
       <u>DEPENDS</u> test property if necessary.

       A  setup  test  is  allowed  to  require other fixtures, but not any fixture listed in its <b>FIXTURES_SETUP</b>
       property. For example:

          # Ok: dependent fixture is different to setup
          set_tests_properties(setupFoo PROPERTIES
            FIXTURES_SETUP    Foo
            FIXTURES_REQUIRED Bar
          )

          # Error: cannot require same fixture as setup
          set_tests_properties(setupFoo PROPERTIES
            FIXTURES_SETUP    Foo
            FIXTURES_REQUIRED Foo
          )

       If any of a fixture's setup tests fail, none of the tests listing that fixture in  its  <u>FIXTURES_REQUIRED</u>
       property will be run. Cleanup tests will, however, still be executed.

       See <u>FIXTURES_REQUIRED</u> for a more complete discussion of how to use test fixtures.

   <b>GENERATED_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE</b>
       Added in version 3.28.

       Path to the <u>dynamically-generated</u> <u>resource</u> <u>spec</u> <u>file</u> generated by this test.

   <b>LABELS</b>
       Specify  a  list of text labels associated with a test.  The labels are reported in both the <b>ctest</b> output
       summary and in dashboard submissions.  They can also be used to filter the set of tests  to  be  executed
       (see the <u>ctest</u> <u>-L</u> and <u>ctest</u> <u>-LE</u> options).

       See <u>Additional</u> <u>Labels</u> for adding labels to a test dynamically during test execution.

   <b>MEASUREMENT</b>
       Specify a <b>CDASH</b> measurement and value to be reported for a test.

       If  set to a name then that name will be reported to <b>CDASH</b> as a named measurement with a value of <b>1</b>.  You
       may also specify a value by setting <b>MEASUREMENT</b> to <b>measurement=value</b>.

   <b>PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</b>
       The test output (stdout or stderr) must match this regular expression for the test to pass.  The  process
       exit  code  is  ignored.  Tests  that  exceed  the  timeout specified by <u>TIMEOUT</u> still fail regardless of
       <b>PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</b>. System-level test failures including segmentation faults, signal abort, or  heap
       errors may fail the test even if <b>PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</b> is matched.

       Example:

          add_test(NAME mytest COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "Passed this test")

          set_property(TEST mytest PROPERTY
            PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "pass;Passed"
          )

       <b>PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</b> expects a list of regular expressions.

       To  run  a  test that may have a system-level failure, but still pass if <b>PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</b> matches,
       use a CMake command to wrap the executable run. Note that this will prevent  automatic  handling  of  the
       <u>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u> and <u>TEST_LAUNCHER</u> target property.

          add_executable(main main.c)

          add_test(NAME sigabrt COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E env $&lt;TARGET_FILE:main&gt;)

          set_property(TEST sigabrt PROPERTY PROPERTY_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "pass;Passed")

          #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/signal.h">signal.h</a>&gt;
          #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;

          int main(void){
              fprintf(stdout, "Passed\n");
              fflush(stdout);  /* ensure the output buffer is seen */
              raise(SIGABRT);
              return 0;
          }

       See also the <u>FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</u> and <u>SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</u> test properties.

   <b>PROCESSOR_AFFINITY</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       Set  to  a  true  value  to  ask  CTest  to  launch the test process with CPU affinity for a fixed set of
       processors.  If enabled and supported for the current platform, CTest will choose a set of processors  to
       place  in  the CPU affinity mask when launching the test process.  The number of processors in the set is
       determined by the <u>PROCESSORS</u> test property or the number of processors available to CTest,  whichever  is
       smaller.   The  set  of  processors  chosen  will  be  disjoint  from  the  processors  assigned to other
       concurrently running tests that also have the <b>PROCESSOR_AFFINITY</b> property enabled.

   <b>PROCESSORS</b>
       Set to specify how many process slots this test requires.  If not set, the default is <b>1</b> processor.

       Denotes the number of processors that this test will require.  This is typically used for MPI tests,  and
       should be used in conjunction with the <u>ctest_test()</u> <b>PARALLEL_LEVEL</b> option.

       This  will also be used to display a weighted test timing result in label and subproject summaries in the
       command line output of <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u>. The wall clock time for the test run will be multiplied by this property
       to give a better idea of how much cpu resource CTest allocated for the test.

       See also the <u>PROCESSOR_AFFINITY</u> test property.

   <b>REQUIRED_FILES</b>
       List of files required to run the test.  The filenames are relative to the test <u>WORKING_DIRECTORY</u>  unless
       an absolute path is specified.

       If set to a list of files, the test will not be run unless all of the files exist.

   <b>Examples</b>
       Suppose that <b>test.txt</b> is created by test <b>baseTest</b> and <b>none.txt</b> does not exist:

          add_test(NAME baseTest ...)   # Assumed to create test.txt
          add_test(NAME fileTest ...)

          # The following ensures that if baseTest is successful, test.txt will
          # have been created before fileTest is run
          set_tests_properties(fileTest PROPERTIES
            DEPENDS baseTest
            REQUIRED_FILES test.txt
          )

          add_test(NAME notRunTest ...)

          # The following makes notRunTest depend on two files. Nothing creates
          # the none.txt file, so notRunTest will fail with status "Not Run".
          set_tests_properties(notRunTest PROPERTIES
            REQUIRED_FILES "test.txt;none.txt"
          )

       The  above  example demonstrates how <b>REQUIRED_FILES</b> works, but it is not the most robust way to implement
       test  ordering  with  failure  detection.   For  that,  test  fixtures  are  a  better  alternative  (see
       <u>FIXTURES_REQUIRED</u>).

   <b>RESOURCE_GROUPS</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Specify  resources  required  by  a  test, grouped in a way that is meaningful to the test.  See <u>resource</u>
       <u>allocation</u> for more information on how this  property  integrates  into  the  CTest  resource  allocation
       feature.

       The  <b>RESOURCE_GROUPS</b> property is a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of group descriptions. Each entry consists of
       an optional number of groups using the description followed by a  series  of  resource  requirements  for
       those  groups.  These  requirements  (and  the  number  of  groups) are separated by commas. The resource
       requirements consist of the name of a resource type, followed by a colon, followed by an unsigned integer
       specifying the number of slots required on one resource of the given type.

       The <b>RESOURCE_GROUPS</b> property tells CTest what resources a test expects to use grouped in a way meaningful
       to the test.  The test itself must read the <u>environment</u> <u>variables</u> to determine which resources have  been
       allocated  to  each  group.  For example, each group may correspond to a process the test will spawn when
       executed.

       Consider the following example:

          add_test(NAME MyTest COMMAND MyExe)
          set_property(TEST MyTest PROPERTY RESOURCE_GROUPS
            "2,gpus:2"
            "gpus:4,crypto_chips:2")

       In this example, there are two group descriptions (implicitly separated by a semicolon.) The  content  of
       the  first  description  is <b>2,gpus:2</b>. This description specifies 2 groups, each of which requires 2 slots
       from a single GPU. The content of the second description is <b>gpus:4,crypto_chips:2</b>. This description  does
       not  specify  a  group  count,  so  a default of 1 is assumed.  This single group requires 4 slots from a
       single GPU and 2 slots from a single cryptography chip. In total, 3 resource  groups  are  specified  for
       this test, each with its own unique requirements.

       Note  that  the number of slots following the resource type specifies slots from a <u>single</u> instance of the
       resource. If the resource group can tolerate  receiving  slots  from  different  instances  of  the  same
       resource, it can indicate this by splitting the specification into multiple requirements of one slot. For
       example:

          add_test(NAME MyTest COMMAND MyExe)
          set_property(TEST MyTest PROPERTY RESOURCE_GROUPS
            "gpus:1,gpus:1,gpus:1,gpus:1")

       In  this  case,  the  single resource group indicates that it needs four GPU slots, all of which may come
       from separate GPUs (though they don't have to; CTest may still assign slots from the same GPU.)

       When CTest sets the <u>environment</u> <u>variables</u> for a test, it assigns  a  group  number  based  on  the  group
       description, starting at 0 on the left and the number of groups minus 1 on the right. For example, in the
       example above, the two groups in the first description would have IDs of 0 and 1, and the single group in
       the second description would have an ID of 2.

       Both  the  <b>RESOURCE_GROUPS</b> and <u>RESOURCE_LOCK</u> properties serve similar purposes, but they are distinct and
       orthogonal. Resources specified by <b>RESOURCE_GROUPS</b> do not affect <u>RESOURCE_LOCK</u>, and vice versa.   Whereas
       <u>RESOURCE_LOCK</u>  is  a  simpler property that is used for locking one global resource, <b>RESOURCE_GROUPS</b> is a
       more advanced property that allows multiple tests to simultaneously use multiple resources  of  the  same
       type, specifying their requirements in a fine-grained manner.

   <b>RESOURCE_LOCK</b>
       Specify a list of resources that are locked by this test.

       If multiple tests specify the same resource lock, they are guaranteed not to run concurrently.

       See also <u>FIXTURES_REQUIRED</u> if the resource requires any setup or cleanup steps.

       Both  the  <u>RESOURCE_GROUPS</u> and <b>RESOURCE_LOCK</b> properties serve similar purposes, but they are distinct and
       orthogonal. Resources specified by <u>RESOURCE_GROUPS</u> do not affect <b>RESOURCE_LOCK</b>, and vice versa.   Whereas
       <b>RESOURCE_LOCK</b>  is  a  simpler property that is used for locking one global resource, <u>RESOURCE_GROUPS</u> is a
       more advanced property that allows multiple tests to simultaneously use multiple resources  of  the  same
       type, specifying their requirements in a fine-grained manner.

   <b>RUN_SERIAL</b>
       Do not run this test in parallel with any other test.

       Use this option in conjunction with the ctest_test <b>PARALLEL_LEVEL</b> option to specify that this test should
       not be run in parallel with any other tests.

   <b>SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       If the test output (stderr or stdout) matches this regular expression the test will be marked as skipped,
       regardless  of  the  process  exit  code.  Tests  that exceed the timeout specified by <u>TIMEOUT</u> still fail
       regardless of <b>SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</b>. System-level test failures including segmentation  faults,  signal
       abort, or heap errors may fail the test even if the regular expression matches.

       Example:

          add_test(NAME mytest COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "Skipped this test")

          set_property(TEST mytest PROPERTY
            SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "[^a-z]Skip" "SKIP" "Skipped"
          )

       <b>SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</b> expects a list of regular expressions.

       To  run  a  test that may have a system-level failure, but still skip if <b>SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</b> matches,
       use a CMake command to wrap the executable run. Note that this will prevent  automatic  handling  of  the
       <u>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u> and <u>TEST_LAUNCHER</u> target property.

          add_executable(main main.c)

          add_test(NAME sigabrt COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E env $&lt;TARGET_FILE:main&gt;)

          set_property(TEST sigabrt PROPERTY SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "SIGABRT;[aA]bort")

          #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/signal.h">signal.h</a>&gt;

          int main(void){ raise(SIGABRT); return 0; }

       See also the <u>SKIP_RETURN_CODE</u>, <u>PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</u>, and <u>FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</u> test properties.

   <b>SKIP_RETURN_CODE</b>
       Return code to mark a test as skipped.

       Sometimes  only a test itself can determine if all requirements for the test are met. If such a situation
       should not be considered a hard failure a return code of the process can be specified that will mark  the
       test as <b>Not</b> <b>Run</b> if it is encountered. Valid values are in the range of 0 to 255, inclusive.

       Tests  that  exceed  the  timeout  specified  by  <u>TIMEOUT</u>  still  fail  regardless  of  <b>SKIP_RETURN_CODE</b>.
       System-level test failures including segmentation faults, signal abort, or heap errors may fail the  test
       even if the return code matches.

          # cmake (1) defines this to return code 1
          add_test(NAME r1 COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E false)

          set_tests_properties(r1 PROPERTIES SKIP_RETURN_CODE 1)

       To  run  a  test  that may have a system-level failure, but still skip if <b>SKIP_RETURN_CODE</b> matches, use a
       CMake command to wrap the executable run.   Note  that  this  will  prevent  automatic  handling  of  the
       <u>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u> and <u>TEST_LAUNCHER</u> target property.

          add_executable(main main.c)

          # cmake -E env &lt;command&gt; returns 1 if the command fails in any way
          add_test(NAME sigabrt COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E env $&lt;TARGET_FILE:main&gt;)

          set_property(TEST sigabrt PROPERTY SKIP_RETURN_CODE 1)

          #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/signal.h">signal.h</a>&gt;

          int main(void){ raise(SIGABRT); return 0; }

       To  handle  multiple  types  of  cases  that may need to be skipped, consider the <u>SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION</u>
       property.

   <b>TIMEOUT</b>
       How many seconds to allow for this test.

       This property if set will limit a test to not take more than the specified number of seconds to run.   If
       it exceeds that the test process will be killed and ctest will move to the next test.  This setting takes
       precedence over <u>CTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT</u>.

       An explicit <b>0</b> value means the test has no timeout, except as necessary to honor <u>ctest</u> <u>--stop-time</u>.

       See also <u>TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH</u> and <u>TIMEOUT_SIGNAL_NAME</u>.

   <b>TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH</b>
       Added in version 3.6.

       Change a test's timeout duration after a matching line is encountered in its output.

   <b>Usage</b>
          add_test(mytest ...)
          set_property(TEST mytest PROPERTY TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH "${seconds}" "${regex}")

   <b>Description</b>
       Allow a test <b>seconds</b> to complete after <b>regex</b> is encountered in its output.

       When  the  test  outputs  a  line  that matches <b>regex</b> its start time is reset to the current time and its
       timeout duration is changed to <b>seconds</b>.  Prior to this, the timeout duration is determined by the <u>TIMEOUT</u>
       property or the <u>CTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT</u> variable if either of these are set.  Because the test's start time is
       reset, its execution time will not include any time that was spent waiting for the matching output.

       <b>TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH</b> is useful for avoiding spurious timeouts when your test must  wait  for  some  system
       resource  to  become available before it can execute.  Set <u>TIMEOUT</u> to a longer duration that accounts for
       resource acquisition and use <b>TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH</b> to control how long the actual test is allowed to run.

       If  the  required  resource  can  be  controlled  by  CTest  you  should  use  <u>RESOURCE_LOCK</u>  instead  of
       <b>TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH</b>.   This  property  should  be  used  when only the test itself can determine when its
       required resources are available.

       See also <u>TIMEOUT_SIGNAL_NAME</u>.

   <b>TIMEOUT_SIGNAL_GRACE_PERIOD</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       If the <u>TIMEOUT_SIGNAL_NAME</u> test property is set, this property specifies the number of  seconds  to  wait
       for  a  test  process  to  terminate  after  sending  the custom signal.  Otherwise, this property has no
       meaning.

       The grace period may be any real value greater than <b>0.0</b>, but not greater than <b>60.0</b>.  If this property  is
       not set, the default is <b>1.0</b> second.

       This is available only on platforms supporting POSIX signals.  It is not available on Windows.

   <b>TIMEOUT_SIGNAL_NAME</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       Specify a custom signal to send to a test process when its timeout is reached.  This is available only on
       platforms supporting POSIX signals.  It is not available on Windows.

       The name must be one of the following:

          <b>SIGINT</b> Interrupt.

          <b>SIGQUIT</b>
                 Quit.

          <b>SIGTERM</b>
                 Terminate.

          <b>SIGUSR1</b>
                 User defined signal 1.

          <b>SIGUSR2</b>
                 User defined signal 2.

       The  custom  signal  is  sent  to  the test process to give it a chance to exit gracefully during a grace
       period:

       • If the test process created any children, it is responsible for terminating them too.

       • The grace period length is determined by the <u>TIMEOUT_SIGNAL_GRACE_PERIOD</u> test property.

       • If the test process does not terminate before the grace period ends, <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> will force termination of
         its entire process tree via <b>SIGSTOP</b> and <b>SIGKILL</b>.

       See also <u>CTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT</u>, <u>TIMEOUT</u>, and <u>TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH</u>.

   <b>WILL_FAIL</b>
       If <b>true</b>, inverts the pass / fail test criteria. Tests for which <b>WILL_FAIL</b> is <b>true</b> fail with return code 0
       and pass with non-zero return code. Tests that  exceed  the  timeout  specified  by  <u>TIMEOUT</u>  still  fail
       regardless of <b>WILL_FAIL</b>.  System-level test failures including segmentation faults, signal abort, or heap
       errors may fail the test even if <b>WILL_FAIL</b> is true.

       Example of a test that would ordinarily pass, but fails because <b>WILL_FAIL</b> is <b>true</b>:

          add_test(NAME failed COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E true)
          set_property(TEST failed PROPERTY WILL_FAIL true)

       To  run  a  test  that  may  have a system-level failure, but still pass if <b>WILL_FAIL</b> is set, use a CMake
       command  to  wrap  the  executable  run.   Note  that  this  will  prevent  automatic  handling  of   the
       <u>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u> and <u>TEST_LAUNCHER</u> target property.

          add_executable(main main.c)

          add_test(NAME sigabrt COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E env $&lt;TARGET_FILE:main&gt;)

          set_property(TEST sigabrt PROPERTY WILL_FAIL TRUE)

          #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/signal.h">signal.h</a>&gt;

          int main(void){ raise(SIGABRT); return 0; }

   <b>WORKING_DIRECTORY</b>
       The directory from which the test executable will be called.

       If  this  is  not  set,  the  test  will  be  run  with the working directory set to the binary directory
       associated with where the test was created (i.e. the <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u> for  where  <u>add_test()</u>  was
       called).

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>SOURCE</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ABSTRACT</b>
       Is this source file an abstract class.

       A  property on a source file that indicates if the source file represents a class that is abstract.  This
       only makes sense for languages that have a notion of an abstract class and it is only used by some  tools
       that wrap classes into other languages.

   <b>AUTORCC_OPTIONS</b>
       Additional options for <b>rcc</b> when using <u>AUTORCC</u>

       This  property  holds  additional command line options which will be used when <b>rcc</b> is executed during the
       build via <u>AUTORCC</u>, i.e. it is equivalent to the optional  <b>OPTIONS</b>  argument  of  the  <u>qt4_add_resources()</u>
       macro.

       By default it is empty.

       The options set on the <b>.qrc</b> source file may override <u>AUTORCC_OPTIONS</u> set on the target.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
          # ...
          set_property(SOURCE resources.qrc PROPERTY AUTORCC_OPTIONS "--compress;9")
          # ...

   <b>AUTOUIC_OPTIONS</b>
       Additional options for <b>uic</b> when using <u>AUTOUIC</u>

       This  property  holds  additional command line options which will be used when <b>uic</b> is executed during the
       build via <u>AUTOUIC</u>, i.e. it is equivalent to the optional <b>OPTIONS</b> argument of the <u>qt4_wrap_ui()</u> macro.

       By default it is empty.

       The options set on the <b>.ui</b> source file may override <u>AUTOUIC_OPTIONS</u> set on the target.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
          # ...
          set_property(SOURCE widget.ui PROPERTY AUTOUIC_OPTIONS "--no-protection")
          # ...

   <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b>
       Preprocessor definitions for compiling a source file.

       The <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b> property may be set to a semicolon-separated  list  of  preprocessor  definitions
       using  the  syntax  <b>VAR</b>  or  <b>VAR=value</b>.   Function-style  definitions  are  not  supported.   CMake  will
       automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may
       require escapes to specify some values).  This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using the
       name <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> where <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> is an upper-case name (ex.  <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG</b>).

       CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported by the native  build  tool.   Xcode
       does not support per-configuration definitions on source files.

       Added in version 3.26: Any leading <b>-D</b> on an item will be removed.

       Disclaimer:  Most  native  build  tools  have  poor  support  for  escaping  certain  values.   CMake has
       work-arounds for many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value  does
       not seem to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape sequences to
       the  value.   Your  work-around  may break in a future version of CMake that has improved escape support.
       Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then report  the  limitation.   Known
       limitations include:

          #          - broken almost everywhere
          ;          - broken in VS IDE 7.0 and Borland Makefiles
          ,          - broken in VS IDE
          %          - broken in some cases in NMake
          &amp; |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
          ^ &lt; &gt; \"   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

       CMake does not reject these values outright because they do work in some cases.  Use with caution.

       Contents  of  <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b> may use <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  See the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual  for  available  expressions.   However,  <u>Xcode</u>  does  not  support
       per-config  per-source  settings,  so  expressions that depend on the build configuration are not allowed
       with that generator.

       Generator expressions should be preferred instead of setting the alternative per-configuration property.

   <b>COMPILE_FLAGS</b>
       Additional flags to be added when compiling this source file.

       The <b>COMPILE_FLAGS</b> property, managed as a string, sets additional compiler flags used that will  be  added
       to  the  list  of  compile flags when this source file builds.  The flags will be added after target-wide
       flags.

       Use <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u> to pass additional preprocessor definitions.

       Contents  of  <b>COMPILE_FLAGS</b>  may  use  "generator  expressions"  with  the  syntax   <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.    See   the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  available  expressions.   However,  <u>Xcode</u>  does  not support
       per-config per-source settings, so expressions that depend on the build  configuration  are  not  allowed
       with that generator.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property has been superseded by the <u>COMPILE_OPTIONS</u> property.

   <b>COMPILE_OPTIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       List of additional options to pass to the compiler.

       This  property holds a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of options and will be added to the list of compile flags
       when this source file builds.  The options will be added after target-wide options.

       Contents  of  <b>COMPILE_OPTIONS</b>  may  use  "generator  expressions"  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See   the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  available  expressions.   However,  <u>Xcode</u>  does  not support
       per-config per-source settings, so expressions that depend on the build  configuration  are  not  allowed
       with that generator.

       Usage example:

          set_source_files_properties(foo.cpp PROPERTIES COMPILE_OPTIONS "-Wno-unused-parameter;-Wno-missing-field-initializer")

       Related properties:

       • Prefer this property over <u>COMPILE_FLAGS</u>.

       • Use <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u> to pass additional preprocessor definitions.

       • Use <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> to pass additional include directories.

       Related commands:

       • <u>add_compile_options()</u> for directory-wide settings

       • <u>target_compile_options()</u> for target-specific settings

   <b>CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES</b>
       Added in version 3.28.

       <b>CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES</b>  is  a  boolean  specifying  whether  CMake  will  scan  the  source  for C++ module
       dependencies.  See also the <u>CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES</u> for target-wide settings.

       When this property is set <b>ON</b>, CMake will scan  the  source  at  build  time  and  add  module  dependency
       information  to  the  compile  line as necessary.  When this property is set <b>OFF</b>, CMake will not scan the
       source at build time.  When this property is unset, the <u>CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES</u> property is consulted.

       Note that scanning is only performed if C++20 or higher is enabled for the target and the source uses the
       <b>CXX</b> language.  Scanning for modules in sources belonging to file  sets  of  type  <b>CXX_MODULES</b>  is  always
       performed.

   <b>EXTERNAL_OBJECT</b>
       If set to true then this is an object file.

       If this property is set to <b>True</b> then the source file is really an object file and should not be compiled.
       It will still be linked into the target though.

   <b>Fortran_FORMAT</b>
       Set to <b>FIXED</b> or <b>FREE</b> to indicate the Fortran source layout.

       This  property  tells  CMake whether a given Fortran source file uses fixed-format or free-format.  CMake
       will pass the corresponding format flag to the compiler.  Consider using the  target-wide  <u>Fortran_FORMAT</u>
       property if all source files in a target share the same format.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          For some compilers, <b>NAG</b>, <b>PGI</b> and <b>Solaris</b> <b>Studio</b>, setting this to <b>OFF</b> will have no effect.

   <b>Fortran_PREPROCESS</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       Control whether the Fortran source file should be unconditionally preprocessed.

       If  unset  or  empty,  rely  on  the  compiler  to  determine whether the file should be preprocessed. If
       explicitly set to <b>OFF</b> then the file does not need to be preprocessed. If explicitly set to <b>ON</b>,  then  the
       file does need to be preprocessed as part of the compilation step.

       When  using  the  <u>Ninja</u>  generator,  all  source files are first preprocessed in order to generate module
       dependency information. Setting this property to <b>OFF</b> will make <b>Ninja</b> skip this step.

       Consider using the target-wide <u>Fortran_PREPROCESS</u> property if all source files in a  target  need  to  be
       preprocessed.

   <b>GENERATED</b>
       Is this source file generated as part of the build or CMake process.

       Changed  in  version  3.20:  Turning  on  the  <b>GENERATED</b> source file property in one directory allows the
       associated source file to be used across directories without the need to manually setting  that  property
       for  other directory scopes, too.  Additionally, it may now be set only to boolean values, and may not be
       turned off once turned on.  See policy <u>CMP0118</u>.

       Changed in version 3.30: Whether or not a source file is generated is an all-or-nothing  global  property
       of  the source.  Consequently, the <b>GENERATED</b> source file property is now visible in all directories.  See
       policy <u>CMP0163</u>.

       Tells the internal CMake engine that a source file is generated by an outside  process  such  as  another
       build  step, or the execution of CMake itself.  This information is then used to exempt the file from any
       existence or validity checks.

       Any file that is

       • created by the execution of commands such as <u>add_custom_command()</u> which run during the build

       • listed as one of the <b>BYPRODUCTS</b> of an <u>add_custom_command()</u> or <u>add_custom_target()</u> command, or

       • created by a CMake <b>AUTOGEN</b> operation such as <u>AUTOMOC</u>, <u>AUTORCC</u>, or <u>AUTOUIC</u>

       will be marked with the <b>GENERATED</b> property.

       When a generated file created as the <b>OUTPUT</b> of an <u>add_custom_command()</u> command is explicitly listed as  a
       source  file  for  any  target  in  the same directory scope (which usually means the same <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>
       file), CMake will automatically create a dependency to make sure the file is  generated  before  building
       that target.

       The <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> will remove <b>GENERATED</b> files during <b>make</b> <b>clean</b>.

       Generated  sources  may be hidden in some IDE tools, while in others they might be shown. For the special
       case of sources generated by CMake's <u>AUTOMOC</u>, <u>AUTORCC</u> or <u>AUTOUIC</u> functionality, the <u>AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP</u>,
       <u>AUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP</u>, <u>AUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP</u> and <u>AUTOUIC_SOURCE_GROUP</u> target properties may influence where
       the generated sources are grouped in the project's file lists.

   <b>HEADER_FILE_ONLY</b>
       Is this source file only a header file.

       A property on a source file that indicates if the source  file  is  a  header  file  with  no  associated
       implementation.   This is set automatically based on the file extension and is used by CMake to determine
       if certain dependency information should be computed.

       By setting this property to <b>ON</b>, you can disable compilation of the given source file, even if  it  should
       be compiled because it is part of the library's/executable's sources.

       This  is  useful  if  you  have  some  source  files  which  you  somehow pre-process, and then add these
       pre-processed sources via <u>add_library()</u>  or  <u>add_executable()</u>.  Normally,  in  IDE,  there  would  be  no
       reference  of  the original sources, only of these pre-processed sources. So by setting this property for
       all the original source files to <b>ON</b>, and then either  calling  <u>add_library()</u>  or  <u>add_executable()</u>  while
       passing  both  the  pre-processed  sources  and the original sources, or by using <u>target_sources()</u> to add
       original source files will do exactly what would one expect, i.e.  the original  source  files  would  be
       visible in IDE, and will not be built.

   <b>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       List of preprocessor include file search directories.

       This  property  holds  a  <u>semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  of  paths  and  will be added to the list of include
       directories when this source file builds. These directories will take precedence over directories defined
       at target level except for <u>Xcode</u> generator due to technical limitations.

       Relative paths should not be added to this property directly.

       Contents of <b>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b> may  use  "generator  expressions"  with  the  syntax  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.   See  the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  available  expressions.   However,  <u>Xcode</u>  does  not support
       per-config per-source settings, so expressions that depend on the build  configuration  are  not  allowed
       with that generator.

   <b>KEEP_EXTENSION</b>
       Make the output file have the same extension as the source file.

       If this property is set then the file extension of the output file will be the same as that of the source
       file.   Normally  the  output  file  extension  is computed based on the language of the source file, for
       example <b>.cxx</b> will go to a <b>.o</b> extension.

   <b>LABELS</b>
       Specify a list of text labels associated with a source file.

       This property has meaning only when the source file is listed in a target whose <b>LABELS</b> property  is  also
       set.  No other semantics are currently specified.

   <b>LANGUAGE</b>
       Specify the programming language in which a source file is written.

       A  property  that  can be set to indicate what programming language the source file is.  If it is not set
       the language is determined based on the file extension.  Typical values are <b>CXX</b> (i.e.  C++),  <b>C</b>,  <b>CSharp</b>,
       <b>CUDA</b>,  <b>Fortran</b>,  <b>HIP</b>,  <b>ISPC</b>, and <b>ASM</b>.  Setting this property for a file means this file will be compiled,
       unless <u>HEADER_FILE_ONLY</u> is set.

       Changed in version 3.20: Setting this property causes the source file to be  compiled  as  the  specified
       language,  using explicit flags if possible.  Previously it only caused the specified language's compiler
       to be used.  See policy <u>CMP0119</u>.

   <b>LOCATION</b>
       The full path to a source file.

       A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the full path to the source file.

   <b>MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION</b>
       Place a source file inside a Application Bundle (<u>MACOSX_BUNDLE</u>),  Core  Foundation  Bundle  (<u>BUNDLE</u>),  or
       Framework Bundle (<u>FRAMEWORK</u>).  It is applicable for macOS and iOS.

       Executable  targets  with the <u>MACOSX_BUNDLE</u> property set are built as macOS or iOS application bundles on
       Apple platforms.  Shared library targets with the <u>FRAMEWORK</u> property  set  are  built  as  macOS  or  iOS
       frameworks  on  Apple  platforms.  Module library targets with the <u>BUNDLE</u> property set are built as macOS
       <b>CFBundle</b> bundles on Apple platforms.  Source files listed in the target with this property  set  will  be
       copied to a directory inside the bundle or framework content folder specified by the property value.  For
       macOS  Application  Bundles  the content folder is <b>&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents</b>.  For macOS Frameworks the content
       folder  is  <b>&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/&lt;version&gt;</b>.    For   macOS   CFBundles   the   content   folder   is
       <b>&lt;name&gt;.bundle/Contents</b>  (unless  the  extension  is changed).  See the <u>PUBLIC_HEADER</u>, <u>PRIVATE_HEADER</u>, and
       <u>RESOURCE</u> target  properties  for  specifying  files  meant  for  <b>Headers</b>,  <b>PrivateHeaders</b>,  or  <b>Resources</b>
       directories.

       If  the  specified  location  is  equal  to  <b>Resources</b>, the resulting location will be the same as if the
       <u>RESOURCE</u> property had been used. If the specified location is a  sub-folder  of  <b>Resources</b>,  it  will  be
       placed  into  the respective sub-folder. Note: For iOS Apple uses a flat bundle layout where no <b>Resources</b>
       folder exist. Therefore CMake strips the <b>Resources</b> folder name from the specified location.

   <b>OBJECT_DEPENDS</b>
       Additional files on which a compiled object file depends.

       Specifies a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of full-paths to files on which any object files compiled from  this
       source  file depend.  On <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> and the <u>Ninja</u> generator an object file will be recompiled if
       any of the named files is newer than it.   <u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u>  and  the  <u>Xcode</u>  generator  cannot
       implement such compilation dependencies.

       This property need not be used to specify the dependency of a source file on a generated header file that
       it  includes.   Although  the  property  was  originally  introduced  for  this  purpose, it is no longer
       necessary.  If the generated header file is created by a custom command in the same target as the  source
       file,  the  automatic dependency scanning process will recognize the dependency.  If the generated header
       file  is  created  by  another  target,  an  inter-target  dependency  should   be   created   with   the
       <u>add_dependencies()</u> command (if one does not already exist due to linking relationships).

   <b>OBJECT_OUTPUTS</b>
       Additional outputs for a <u>Ninja</u> or <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> rule.

       Additional  outputs  created  by compilation of this source file.  If any of these outputs is missing the
       object will be recompiled.  This is supported only on the <u>Ninja</u>  and  <u>Makefile</u>  <u>Generators</u>  and  will  be
       ignored on other generators.

       This property supports <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

   <b>SKIP_AUTOGEN</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Exclude the source file from <u>AUTOMOC</u>, <u>AUTOUIC</u> and <u>AUTORCC</u> processing (for Qt projects).

       For finer exclusion control see <u>SKIP_AUTOMOC</u>, <u>SKIP_AUTOUIC</u> and <u>SKIP_AUTORCC</u>.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
          # ...
          set_property(SOURCE file.h PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOGEN ON)
          # ...

   <b>SKIP_AUTOMOC</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Exclude the source file from <u>AUTOMOC</u> processing (for Qt projects).

       For broader exclusion control see <u>SKIP_AUTOGEN</u>.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
          # ...
          set_property(SOURCE file.h PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOMOC ON)
          # ...

   <b>SKIP_AUTORCC</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Exclude the source file from <u>AUTORCC</u> processing (for Qt projects).

       For broader exclusion control see <u>SKIP_AUTOGEN</u>.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
          # ...
          set_property(SOURCE file.qrc PROPERTY SKIP_AUTORCC ON)
          # ...

   <b>SKIP_AUTOUIC</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Exclude the source file from <u>AUTOUIC</u> processing (for Qt projects).

       <b>SKIP_AUTOUIC</b> can be set on C++ header and source files and on <b>.ui</b> files.

       For broader exclusion control see <u>SKIP_AUTOGEN</u>.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
          # ...
          set_property(SOURCE file.h PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOUIC ON)
          set_property(SOURCE file.cpp PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOUIC ON)
          set_property(SOURCE widget.ui PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOUIC ON)
          # ...

   <b>SKIP_LINTING</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       This  property allows you to exclude a specific source file from the linting process. The linting process
       involves   running   tools   such   as   <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPLINT</u>,    <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CLANG_TIDY</u>,    <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPCHECK</u>,    and
       <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE</u>  on  the  source  files,  as  well  as  compiling  header  files  as  part of
       <u>VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS</u>. By setting <b>SKIP_LINTING</b> on a source file, the mentioned linting tools  will
       not be executed for that particular file.

   <b>Example</b>
       Consider  a  C++  project  that  includes  multiple  source  files,  such  as  <b>main.cpp</b>,  <b>things.cpp</b>, and
       <b>generatedBindings.cpp</b>.  In this example, you want to exclude  the  <b>generatedBindings.cpp</b>  file  from  the
       linting   process.   To   achieve   this,   you   can   utilize   the   <b>SKIP_LINTING</b>  property  with  the
       <u>set_source_files_properties()</u> command as shown below:

          add_executable(MyApp main.cpp things.cpp generatedBindings.cpp)

          set_source_files_properties(generatedBindings.cpp PROPERTIES
              SKIP_LINTING ON
          )

       In the provided code snippet, the <b>SKIP_LINTING</b> property is set  to  true  for  the  <b>generatedBindings.cpp</b>
       source  file.  As  a  result,  when  the  linting  tools  specified by <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPLINT</u>, <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CLANG_TIDY</u>,
       <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPCHECK</u>,  or  <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE</u>  are   executed,   they   will   skip   analyzing   the
       <b>generatedBindings.cpp</b> file.

       By  using  the  <b>SKIP_LINTING</b> property, you can selectively exclude specific source files from the linting
       process. This allows you to focus the linting tools on the relevant parts of your project, enhancing  the
       efficiency and effectiveness of the linting workflow.

   <b>SKIP_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Is this source file skipped by <u>PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</u> feature.

       This  property  helps  with  build  problems  that  one  would run into when using the <u>PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</u>
       feature.

       One example would be the usage of Objective-C (<b>*.m</b>) files, and Objective-C++ (<b>*.mm</b>) files, which lead  to
       compilation  failure  because  they  are  treated  (in  case of Ninja / Makefile generator) as C, and CXX
       respectively. The precompile headers are not compatible between languages.

   <b>SKIP_UNITY_BUILD_INCLUSION</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Setting this property to true ensures the source file will be skipped by unity builds when its associated
       target has its <u>UNITY_BUILD</u> property set to true.  The source file will instead be compiled on its own  in
       the same way as it would with unity builds disabled.

       This  property  helps  with "ODR (One definition rule)" problems where combining a particular source file
       with others might lead to build errors or other unintended side effects.

       Note that sources which are scanned for C++ modules (see <u><a href="../man7/cmake-cxxmodules.7.html">cmake-cxxmodules</a>(7)</u>) are not eligible for  unity
       build inclusion and will automatically be excluded.

   <b>Swift_DEPENDENCIES_FILE</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       This  property  sets  the  path  for the Swift dependency file (swiftdeps) for the source.  If one is not
       specified, it will default to <b>&lt;OBJECT&gt;.swiftdeps</b>.

   <b>Swift_DIAGNOSTICS_FILE</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       This property controls where the Swift diagnostics are serialized.

   <b>SYMBOLIC</b>
       Is this just a name for a rule.

       If <b>SYMBOLIC</b> (boolean) is set to <b>True</b> the build system will be  informed  that  the  source  file  is  not
       actually created on disk but instead used as a symbolic name for a build rule.

   <b>UNITY_GROUP</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       This property controls which <u>bucket</u> the source will be part of when the <u>UNITY_BUILD_MODE</u> is set to <b>GROUP</b>.

   <b>VS_COPY_TO_OUT_DIR</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Sets  the <b>&lt;CopyToOutputDirectory&gt;</b> tag for a source file in a Visual Studio project file. Valid values are
       <b>Never</b>, <b>Always</b> and <b>PreserveNewest</b>.

   <b>VS_CSHARP_&lt;tagname&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Visual Studio and CSharp source-file-specific configuration.

       Tell the <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>generators</u> to set the source file tag <b>&lt;tagname&gt;</b> to a given value in the  generated
       Visual  Studio  CSharp  project.  Ignored on other generators and languages. This property can be used to
       define dependencies between source files or set any other Visual Studio specific parameters.

       Example usage:

          set_source_files_properties(&lt;filename&gt;
                   PROPERTIES
                   VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon &lt;other file&gt;
                   VS_CSHARP_SubType "Form")

   <b>VS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Mark a source file as content for deployment with a Windows Phone or Windows Store application when built
       with a <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>generators</u>.  The value must evaluate  to  either  <b>1</b>  or  <b>0</b>  and  may  use  <u>generator</u>
       <u>expressions</u>  to make the choice based on the build configuration.  The <b>.vcxproj</b> file entry for the source
       file will be marked either <b>DeploymentContent</b> or <b>ExcludedFromBuild</b> for values <b>1</b> and <b>0</b>, respectively.

   <b>VS_DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Specifies the deployment location for a content source  file  with  a  Windows  Phone  or  Windows  Store
       application  when  built  with  a  <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>generators</u>.  This property is only applicable when using
       <u>VS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT</u>.  The value represent the path relative to the  app  package  and  applies  to  all
       configurations.

   <b>VS_INCLUDE_IN_VSIX</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Boolean  property  to  specify  if  the  file should be included within a VSIX (Visual Studio Integration
       Extension) extension package.  This is needed for development of Visual Studio extensions.

   <b>VS_RESOURCE_GENERATOR</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       This property allows to specify the  resource  generator  to  be  used  on  this  file.  It  defaults  to
       <b>PublicResXFileCodeGenerator</b> if not set.

       This property only applies to C# projects.

   <b>VS_SETTINGS</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       Set any item metadata on a file.

       Added in version 3.22: This property is honored for all source file types.  Previously it worked only for
       non-built files.

       Takes  a  list of <b>Key=Value</b> pairs. Tells the Visual Studio generator to set <b>Key</b> to <b>Value</b> as item metadata
       on the file.

       For example:

          set_property(SOURCE file.hlsl PROPERTY VS_SETTINGS "Key=Value" "Key2=Value2")

       will set <b>Key</b> to <b>Value</b> and <b>Key2</b> to <b>Value2</b> on the <b>file.hlsl</b> item as metadata.

       <u>Generator</u> <u>expressions</u> are supported.

   <b>VS_SHADER_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       Disable compiler optimizations for an <b>.hlsl</b> source file.  This adds the <b>-Od</b> flag to the command line  for
       the FxCompiler tool.  Specify the value <b>true</b> for this property to disable compiler optimizations.

   <b>VS_SHADER_ENABLE_DEBUG</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       Enable  debugging  information  for an <b>.hlsl</b> source file.  This adds the <b>-Zi</b> flag to the command line for
       the FxCompiler tool.  Specify the value <b>true</b> to generate debugging information for the compiled shader.

   <b>VS_SHADER_ENTRYPOINT</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Specifies the name of the entry point for the shader of a <b>.hlsl</b> source file.

   <b>VS_SHADER_FLAGS</b>
       Added in version 3.2.

       Set additional Visual Studio shader flags of a <b>.hlsl</b> source file.

   <b>VS_SHADER_MODEL</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Specifies the shader model of a <b>.hlsl</b> source file. Some shader types can only be used with recent  shader
       models

   <b>VS_SHADER_OBJECT_FILE_NAME</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       Specifies  a  file  name for the compiled shader object file for an <b>.hlsl</b> source file.  This adds the <b>-Fo</b>
       flag to the command line for the FxCompiler tool.

   <b>VS_SHADER_OUTPUT_HEADER_FILE</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       Set filename for output header file containing object code of a <b>.hlsl</b> source file.

   <b>VS_SHADER_TYPE</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Set the Visual Studio shader type of a <b>.hlsl</b> source file.

   <b>VS_SHADER_VARIABLE_NAME</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       Set name of variable in header file containing object code of a <b>.hlsl</b> source file.

   <b>VS_TOOL_OVERRIDE</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Override the default Visual Studio tool that will be applied to the source file with a new tool not based
       on the extension of the file.

   <b>VS_XAML_TYPE</b>
       Added in version 3.3.

       Mark a Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) source file as a different  type  than  the  default
       <b>Page</b>.  The most common usage would be to set the default <b>App.xaml</b> file as <b>ApplicationDefinition</b>.

   <b>WRAP_EXCLUDE</b>
       Exclude this source file from any code wrapping techniques.

       Some packages can wrap source files into alternate languages to provide additional functionality.

       For  example,  C++  code can be wrapped into Java or Python, using SWIG.  If <b>WRAP_EXCLUDE</b> is set to <b>True</b>,
       that indicates that this source file should not be wrapped.

   <b>XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Set the <u>Xcode</u> <b>explicitFileType</b> attribute on its reference to a source file.   CMake  computes  a  default
       based on file extension but can be told explicitly with this property.

       See also <u>XCODE_LAST_KNOWN_FILE_TYPE</u>.

   <b>XCODE_FILE_ATTRIBUTES</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Add  values  to the <u>Xcode</u> <b>ATTRIBUTES</b> setting on its reference to a source file.  Among other things, this
       can be used to set the role on a <b>.mig</b> file:

          set_source_files_properties(defs.mig
              PROPERTIES
                  XCODE_FILE_ATTRIBUTES "Client;Server"
          )

   <b>XCODE_LAST_KNOWN_FILE_TYPE</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Set the <u>Xcode</u> <b>lastKnownFileType</b> attribute on its reference to a source file.  CMake  computes  a  default
       based on file extension but can be told explicitly with this property.

       See also <u>XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE</u>, which is preferred over this property if set.

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>ENTRIES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ADVANCED</b>
       True if entry should be hidden by default in GUIs.

       This  is  a  boolean  value  indicating  whether  the  entry  is considered interesting only for advanced
       configuration.  The <u>mark_as_advanced()</u> command modifies this property.

   <b>HELPSTRING</b>
       Help associated with entry in GUIs.

       This string summarizes the purpose of an entry to help users set it through a CMake GUI.

   <b>MODIFIED</b>
       Internal management property.  Do not set or get.

       This is an internal cache entry property managed by CMake  to  track  interactive  user  modification  of
       entries.  Ignore it.

   <b>STRINGS</b>
       Enumerate possible <b>STRING</b> entry values for GUI selection.

       For  cache entries with type <b>STRING</b>, this enumerates a set of values.  CMake GUIs may use this to provide
       a selection widget instead of a generic string entry field.  This is for convenience  only.   CMake  does
       not enforce that the value matches one of those listed.

   <b>TYPE</b>
       Widget type for entry in GUIs.

       Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs present widgets to help users set values.  The GUIs
       use this property as a hint to determine the widget type.  Valid <b>TYPE</b> values are:

          BOOL          = Boolean ON/OFF value.
          PATH          = Path to a directory.
          FILEPATH      = Path to a file.
          STRING        = Generic string value.
          INTERNAL      = Do not present in GUI at all.
          STATIC        = Value managed by CMake, do not change.
          UNINITIALIZED = Type not yet specified.

       Generally  the  <b>TYPE</b>  of  a  cache entry should be set by the command which creates it ( <u>set()</u>, <u>option()</u>,
       <u>find_library()</u>, etc.).

   <b>VALUE</b>
       Value of a cache entry.

       This property maps to the actual value of a cache entry.  Setting this property  always  sets  the  value
       without checking, so use with care.

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>INSTALLED</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATED</b> <b>PROPERTIES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.15: Use <u>ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES</u> instead.

       Additional files to remove during the clean stage.

       A <u>;-list</u> of files that will be removed as a part of the <b>make</b> <b>clean</b> target.

       Arguments to <b>ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       This property only works for the Makefile generators.  It is ignored on other generators.

   <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Ignored.  See CMake Policy <u>CMP0043</u>.

       Per-configuration preprocessor definitions in a directory.

       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual for
       more on defining buildsystem properties.

       Generator expressions should be preferred instead of setting this property.

   <b>IMPORTED_NO_SYSTEM</b>
       Added in version 3.23.

       Deprecated  since  version  3.25: <b>IMPORTED_NO_SYSTEM</b> is deprecated. Please use the following alternatives
       instead:

       • Set <u>SYSTEM</u> to false if you  don't  want  a  target's  include  directories  to  be  treated  as  system
         directories when compiling consumers.

       • Set <u>EXPORT_NO_SYSTEM</u> to true if you don't want the include directories of the imported target generated
         by <u>install(EXPORT)</u> and <u>export()</u> commands to be treated as system directories when compiling consumers.

       Setting  <b>IMPORTED_NO_SYSTEM</b> to true on an <u>imported</u> <u>target</u> specifies that it is not a system target.  This
       has the following effects:

       • Entries of <u>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> are not treated as system include directories  when  compiling
         consumers  (regardless  of  the  value  of  the consumed target's <u>SYSTEM</u> property), as they would be by
         default.   Entries of <u>INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> are not affected, and will always be treated
         as system include directories.

       • On Apple platforms, when the target is a framework, it will not be treated as system.

       This property can also be enabled on a non-imported target.  Doing so does not affect the  build  system,
       but  does  tell  the  <u>install(EXPORT)</u>  and  <u>export()</u>  commands  to enable it on the imported targets they
       generate.

       See the <u>NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED</u> target property to set this behavior on the target <u>consuming</u> the  include
       directories rather than the one <u>providing</u> them.

   <b>IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED</b>
       Added in version 3.5.

       Deprecated  since  version  3.28: <u>IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED</u> was designed to make universal binaries containing
       iOS/arm* device code paired  with  iOS  Simulator/x86_64  code  (or  similar  for  other  Apple  embedded
       platforms).  Universal  binaries  can  only differentiate code based on CPU type, so this only made sense
       before the days of arm64 macOS machines (i.e. iOS Simulator/arm64). Apple  now  recommends  xcframeworks,
       which contain multiple binaries for different platforms, for this use case.

       Build a combined (device and simulator) target when installing.

       When  this  property  is set to false, which is the default, then it will either be built with the device
       SDK or the simulator SDK depending on the SDK set. But if this property is set to true  then  the  target
       will at install time also be built for the other SDK and combined into one library.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          If a selected architecture is available for both device SDK and simulator SDK it will be built for the
          SDK selected by <u>CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT</u> and removed from the other SDK.

       This feature requires at least Xcode version 6.

   <b>POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT</b>
       Deprecated install support.

       The <u>PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT</u> and <b>POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT</b> properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run
       before and after installing a target.  They are used only when the old <b>INSTALL_TARGETS</b> command is used to
       install the target.  Use the <u>install()</u> command instead.

   <b>PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT</b>
       Deprecated install support.

       The <b>PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT</b> and <u>POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT</u> properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run
       before and after installing a target.  They are used only when the old <b>INSTALL_TARGETS</b> command is used to
       install the target.  Use the <u>install()</u> command instead.

   <b>VS_WINRT_EXTENSIONS</b>
       Deprecated.  Use <u>VS_WINRT_COMPONENT</u> instead.  This property was an experimental partial implementation of
       that one.

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATED</b> <b>PROPERTIES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>SOURCE</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Ignored.  See CMake Policy <u>CMP0043</u>.

       Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a source file.

       This  is  the  configuration-specific  version  of <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u>.  Note that <u>Xcode</u> does not support
       per-configuration source file flags so this property will be ignored by the <u>Xcode</u> generator.
