       cmake-variables - CMake Variables Reference

       This  page  documents  variables  that are provided by CMake or have meaning to CMake when set by project
       code.

       For general information on variables, see the <u>Variables</u> section in the cmake-language manual.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          CMake reserves identifiers that:

          • begin with <b>CMAKE_</b> (upper-, lower-, or mixed-case), or

          • begin with <b>_CMAKE_</b> (upper-, lower-, or mixed-case), or

          • begin with <b>_</b> followed by the name of any <u>CMake</u> <u>Command</u>.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b> <b>THAT</b> <b>PROVIDE</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CMAKE_AR</b>
       Name of archiving tool for static libraries.

       This specifies the name of the program that creates archive or static libraries.

   <b>CMAKE_ARGC</b>
       Number of command line arguments passed to CMake in script mode.

       When run in <u>-P</u> script mode, CMake sets this variable to the number of command line arguments.   See  also
       <u>CMAKE_ARGV0</u>, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> ...

   <b>CMAKE_ARGV0</b>
       Command line argument passed to CMake in script mode.

       When  run  in  <u>-P</u> script mode, CMake sets this variable to the first command line argument.  It then also
       sets <b>CMAKE_ARGV1</b>, <b>CMAKE_ARGV2</b>, ... and so on, up to the number of command line arguments given.  See also
       <u>CMAKE_ARGC</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</b>
       The path to the top level of the build tree.

       This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake build tree.  For  an  in-source  build,  this
       would be the same as <u>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</u>.

       When  run  in  <u>cmake</u>  <u>-P</u>  script  mode,  CMake  sets  the  variables  <b>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</b>, <u>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</u>,
       <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u> and <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u> to the current working directory.

   <b>CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL</b>
       This variable exists only for backwards compatibility.  It contains the same value as <u>CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM</u>.
       Use that variable instead.

   <b>CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION</b>
       Major version of CMake used to create the <b>CMakeCache.txt</b> file

       This stores the major version of CMake used to write a CMake cache file.  It is  only  different  when  a
       different version of CMake is run on a previously created cache file.

   <b>CMAKE_CACHE_MINOR_VERSION</b>
       Minor version of CMake used to create the <b>CMakeCache.txt</b> file

       This  stores  the  minor  version of CMake used to write a CMake cache file.  It is only different when a
       different version of CMake is run on a previously created cache file.

   <b>CMAKE_CACHE_PATCH_VERSION</b>
       Patch version of CMake used to create the <b>CMakeCache.txt</b> file

       This stores the patch version of CMake used to write a CMake cache file.  It is  only  different  when  a
       different version of CMake is run on a previously created cache file.

   <b>CMAKE_CACHEFILE_DIR</b>
       This  variable  is used internally by CMake, and may not be set during the first configuration of a build
       tree.  When it is set, it has the same value as <u>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</u>.  Use that variable instead.

   <b>CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.21: This variable has poor support on <u>Ninja</u>  <u>Multi-Config</u>,  and  predates  the
       existence of the <u>$&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> generator expression. Use <b>$&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> instead.

       Build-time reference to per-configuration output subdirectory.

       For  native  build  systems  supporting  multiple configurations in the build tree (such as <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u>
       <u>Generators</u> and <u>Xcode</u>), the value is a reference to a build-time  variable  specifying  the  name  of  the
       per-configuration  output subdirectory.  On <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> this evaluates to <u>.</u> because there is only
       one configuration in a build tree.  Example values:

          $(Configuration)     = Visual Studio
          $(CONFIGURATION)     = Xcode
          .                    = Make-based tools
          .                    = Ninja
          ${CONFIGURATION}     = Ninja Multi-Config

       Since these values are evaluated by the native build system, this variable is suitable only  for  use  in
       command lines that will be evaluated at build time.  Example of intended usage:

          add_executable(mytool mytool.c)
          add_custom_command(
            OUTPUT out.txt
            COMMAND ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool
                    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt
            DEPENDS mytool in.txt
            )
          add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)

       Note  that  <b>CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR</b>  is no longer necessary for this purpose but has been left for compatibility
       with existing projects.  Instead <u>add_custom_command()</u> recognizes executable target names in  its  <b>COMMAND</b>
       option, so <b>${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool</b> can be replaced by just <b>mytool</b>.

       This  variable is read-only.  Setting it is undefined behavior.  In multi-configuration build systems the
       value of this variable is passed as the value of preprocessor symbol <b>CMAKE_INTDIR</b> to the  compilation  of
       all source files.

   <b>CMAKE_COMMAND</b>
       The full path to the <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u> executable.

       This  is the full path to the CMake executable <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u> which is useful from custom commands that want to
       use the <u>cmake</u> <u>-E</u> option for portable system commands.  (e.g.  <b>/usr/local/bin/cmake</b>)

   <b>CMAKE_CPACK_COMMAND</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       Full path to <u><a href="../man1/cpack.1.html">cpack</a>(1)</u> command installed with CMake.

       This is the full path to the CPack executable <u><a href="../man1/cpack.1.html">cpack</a>(1)</u> that can be used for custom commands or  tests  to
       invoke CPack commands.

   <b>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING</b>
       This  variable  is set by CMake to indicate whether it is cross compiling, but note limitations discussed
       below.

       This variable will be set to true by CMake if the <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u> variable has been set manually  (i.e.
       in  a  toolchain  file  or as a cache entry from the <u>cmake</u> command line). In most cases, manually setting
       <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u> will only be done when cross compiling since, if not manually set, it will be given the
       same value as <u>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME</u>, which is correct for the non-cross-compiling  case.  In  the  event
       that   <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u>   is   manually   set   to   the  same  value  as  <u>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME</u>,  then
       <b>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING</b> will still be set to true.

       Another case to be aware of is that builds  targeting  Apple  platforms  other  than  macOS  are  handled
       differently  to  other  cross compiling scenarios. Rather than relying on <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u> to select the
       target platform, Apple  device  builds  use  <u>CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT</u>  to  select  the  appropriate  SDK,  which
       indirectly  determines  the  target platform. Furthermore, when using the <u>Xcode</u> generator, developers can
       switch between device and simulator builds at build time rather than having a single choice at  configure
       time,  so  the concept of whether the build is cross compiling or not is more complex. Therefore, the use
       of <b>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING</b> is not recommended for projects targeting Apple devices.

   <b>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</b>
       Added in version 3.3.

       This variable is only used when <u>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING</u> is on. It should point to  a  command  on  the  host
       system that can run executable built for the target system.

       Added  in version 3.15: If this variable contains a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u>, then the first value is the
       command and remaining values are its arguments.

       Added in version 3.28: This variable can be initialized via an <u>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u>  environment
       variable.

       The  command  will  be used to run <u>try_run()</u> generated executables, which avoids manual population of the
       <b>TryRunResults.cmake</b> file.

       This variable is also used as the default  value  for  the  <u>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u>  target  property  of
       executables.   However,  while  <u>generator</u>  <u>expressions</u>  are supported by the target property (since CMake
       3.29), they are <u>not</u> supported by this variable's <u>try_run()</u> functionality.

   <b>CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND</b>
       Full path to <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> command installed with CMake.

       This is the full path to the CTest executable <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> that can be used for custom commands or  tests  to
       invoke CTest commands.

   <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</b>
       The path to the binary directory currently being processed.

       This  is the full path to the build directory that is currently being processed by cmake.  Each directory
       added by <u>add_subdirectory()</u> will create a binary directory  in  the  build  tree,  and  as  it  is  being
       processed  this  variable  will  be set.  For in-source builds this is the current source directory being
       processed.

       When run  in  <u>cmake</u>  <u>-P</u>  script  mode,  CMake  sets  the  variables  <u>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</u>,  <u>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</u>,
       <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</b> and <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u> to the current working directory.

   <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       When executing code inside a <u>function()</u>, this variable contains the name of the current function.  It can
       be useful for diagnostic or debug messages.

       See        also        <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR</u>,        <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_FILE</u>       and
       <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_LINE</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       When executing code inside a <u>function()</u>, this variable contains the full directory of the  listfile  that
       defined the current function.

       It  is  quite  common practice in CMake for modules to use some additional files, such as templates to be
       copied in after substituting CMake variables.  In such cases, a function needs to know  where  to  locate
       those   files   in   a   way   that   doesn't   depend   on   where  the  function  is  called.   Without
       <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR</b>, the code to do that would typically use the following pattern:

          set(_THIS_MODULE_BASE_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}")

          function(foo)
            configure_file(
              "${_THIS_MODULE_BASE_DIR}/some.template.in"
              some.output
            )
          endfunction()

       Using <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR</b> inside the function instead  eliminates  the  need  for  the  extra
       variable which would otherwise be visible outside the function's scope.  The above example can be written
       in the more concise and more robust form:

          function(foo)
            configure_file(
              "${CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR}/some.template.in"
              some.output
            )
          endfunction()

       See also <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION</u>, <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_FILE</u> and <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_LINE</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_FILE</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       When  executing  code  inside  a  <u>function()</u>,  this  variable contains the full path to the listfile that
       defined the current function.

       See also <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION</u>, <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR</u> and <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_LINE</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_LINE</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       When executing code inside a <u>function()</u>, this variable contains the line number in the listfile where the
       current function was defined.

       See also <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION</u>, <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR</u> and <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_FILE</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR</b>
       Full directory of the listfile currently being processed.

       As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will always be set to the directory  where
       the  listfile  which  is  currently  being processed (<u>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE</u>) is located.  The value has
       dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in a source file  it  sets  this  variable  to  the
       directory  where this file is located.  When CMake finishes processing commands from the file it restores
       the previous value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or function is the  directory  of
       the  file  invoking the bottom-most entry on the call stack, not the directory of the file containing the
       macro or function definition.

       See also <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE</b>
       Full path to the listfile currently being processed.

       As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will always be set to  the  one  currently
       being processed.  The value has dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in a source file it
       sets this variable to the location of the file.  When CMake finishes processing commands from the file it
       restores  the previous value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or function is the file
       invoking the bottom-most entry on the  call  stack,  not  the  file  containing  the  macro  or  function
       definition.

       See also <u>CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_LINE</b>
       The line number of the current file being processed.

       This is the line number of the file currently being processed by cmake.

       If  CMake  is  currently  processing  deferred calls scheduled by the <u>cmake_language(DEFER)</u> command, this
       variable evaluates to <b>DEFERRED</b> instead of a specific line number.

   <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</b>
       The path to the source directory currently being processed.

       This is the full path to the source directory that is currently being processed by cmake.

       When run  in  <u>cmake</u>  <u>-P</u>  script  mode,  CMake  sets  the  variables  <u>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</u>,  <u>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</u>,
       <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u> and <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</b> to the current working directory.

   <b>CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES</b>
       Enables tracing output for target properties.

       This  variable  can  be  populated with a list of properties to generate debug output for when evaluating
       target properties.  Currently it can only be used when evaluating:

       • <u>AUTOUIC_OPTIONS</u>

       • <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u>

       • <u>COMPILE_FEATURES</u>

       • <u>COMPILE_OPTIONS</u>

       • <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>

       • <u>LINK_DIRECTORIES</u>

       • <u>LINK_OPTIONS</u>

       • <u>POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</u>

       • <u>SOURCES</u>

       target  properties  and  any   other   property   listed   in   <u>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING</u>   and   other
       <b>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_</b>  properties.   It outputs an origin for each entry in the target property.  Default
       is unset.

   <b>CMAKE_DIRECTORY_LABELS</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       Specify labels for the current directory.

       This is used to initialize the <u>LABELS</u> directory property.

   <b>CMAKE_DL_LIBS</b>
       Name of library containing <b>dlopen</b> and <b>dlclose</b>.

       The name of the library that has <b>dlopen</b> and <b>dlclose</b> in it, usually <b>-ldl</b> on most UNIX machines.

   <b>CMAKE_DOTNET_SDK</b>
       Added in version 3.23.

       Default value for <u>DOTNET_SDK</u> property of targets.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>DOTNET_SDK</u> property on all targets. See that target property  for
       additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       Default value for <u>DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK</u> property  of targets.

       This  variable is used to initialize the <u>DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK</u> property on all targets. See that target
       property for additional information.

       Setting <b>CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK</b> may be necessary when working with  <b>C#</b>  and  newer  .NET  framework
       versions to avoid referencing errors with the <b>ALL_BUILD</b> CMake target.

       This variable is only evaluated for <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> VS 2010 and above.

   <b>CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       Default value for <u>DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION</u> property of targets.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION</u> property on all targets. See that
       target property for additional information. When set, <u>CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK</u> takes precednece over
       this variable. See that variable or the associated target property <u>DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK</u> for additional
       information.

       Setting  <b>CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION</b>  may  be  necessary  when  working  with <b>C#</b> and newer .NET
       framework versions to avoid referencing errors with the <b>ALL_BUILD</b> CMake target.

       This variable is only evaluated for <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> VS 2010 and above.

   <b>CMAKE_EDIT_COMMAND</b>
       Full path to <u><a href="../man1/cmake-gui.1.html">cmake-gui</a>(1)</u> or <u><a href="../man1/ccmake.1.html">ccmake</a>(1)</u>.  Defined only for <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> and <u>Ninja</u>  <u>Generators</u>  when
       not using any <u>Extra</u> <u>Generators</u>.

       This  is  the  full  path  to  the  CMake  executable  that can graphically edit the cache.  For example,
       <u><a href="../man1/cmake-gui.1.html">cmake-gui</a>(1)</u> or <u><a href="../man1/ccmake.1.html">ccmake</a>(1)</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX</b>
       The suffix for executables on the target platform.

       The suffix to use for the end of an executable filename if any, <b>.exe</b> on Windows.

       <u>CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;</u> overrides this for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

       See the <u>CMAKE_HOST_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX</u> variable for the executable suffix on the host platform.

   <b>CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;</b>
       The suffix to use for the end of an executable filename of <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> compiler target architecture, if any.

       It overrides <u>CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX</u> for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_EXTRA_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES</b>
       Additional suffixes for shared libraries.

       Extensions for shared libraries other than that specified by <u>CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX</u>, if any.   CMake
       uses this to recognize external shared library files during analysis of libraries linked by a target.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_DEBUG_MODE</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       Print extra find call information for the following commands to standard error:

       • <u>find_program()</u>

       • <u>find_library()</u>

       • <u>find_file()</u>

       • <u>find_path()</u>

       • <u>find_package()</u>

       Output  is  designed  for human consumption and not for parsing.  Enabling this variable is equivalent to
       using <u>cmake</u> <u>--debug-find</u> with the added ability to enable debugging for a subset of find calls.

          set(CMAKE_FIND_DEBUG_MODE TRUE)
          find_program(...)
          set(CMAKE_FIND_DEBUG_MODE FALSE)

       Default is unset.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME</b>
       Added in version 3.1.1.

       Defined by the <u>find_package()</u> command while loading a find module to record the caller-specified  package
       name.  See command documentation for details.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       This  read-only  variable  specifies  a directory that the <u>find_package()</u> command will check first before
       searching anywhere else for a module or config package file.  A config package  file  in  this  directory
       will always be found in preference to any other Find module file or config package file.

       The   primary  purpose  of  this  variable  is  to  facilitate  integration  between  <u>find_package()</u>  and
       <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u>.      The     latter     command     may     create     files     in     the
       <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR</b>  directory when it populates a dependency.  This allows subsequent calls
       to <u>find_package()</u> for the same dependency to reuse the populated contents instead of  trying  to  satisfy
       the  dependency  from  somewhere  external to the build.  Projects may also want to write files into this
       directory in some situations (see <u>Integrating</u> <u>With</u> <u>find_package()</u> for examples).

       The directory that <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR</b> points to will always be erased and  recreated  empty
       at the start of every CMake run.  Any files written into this directory during the CMake run will be lost
       the next time CMake configures the project.

       <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR</b>  is  only set in CMake project mode.  It is not set when CMake is run in
       script mode (i.e. <u>cmake</u> <u>-P</u>).

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       The sorting direction used by <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER</u>.  It can assume one of the following values:

       <b>DEC</b>    Default.  Ordering is done in descending mode.  The highest folder found will be tested first.

       <b>ASC</b>    Ordering is done in ascending mode.  The lowest folder found will be tested first.

       If <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER</u> is not set or is set to <b>NONE</b> this variable has no effect.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       The default order for sorting directories which match a search path containing a  glob  expression  found
       using <u>find_package()</u>.  It can assume one of the following values:

       <b>NONE</b>   Default.  No attempt is done to sort directories.  The first valid package found will be selected.

       <b>NAME</b>   Sort directories lexicographically before searching.

       <b>NATURAL</b>
              Sort  directories using natural order (see <b><a href="../man3/strverscmp.3.html">strverscmp</a>(3)</b> manual), i.e. such that contiguous digits
              are compared as whole numbers.

       Natural sorting can be employed to return the highest version when multiple versions of the same  library
       are  available  to  be  found  by  <u>find_package()</u>.  For example suppose that the following libraries have
       package configuration files on disk, in a directory of the same name, with all such directories  residing
       in the same parent directory:

       • libX-1.1.0

       • libX-1.2.9

       • libX-1.2.10

       By setting <b>NATURAL</b> order we can select the one with the highest version number <b>libX-1.2.10</b>.

          set(CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER NATURAL)
          find_package(libX CONFIG)

       The  sort  direction  can  be controlled using the <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION</u> variable (by default
       descending, e.g. lib-B will be tested before lib-A).

   <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR</b>
       The generator used to build the project.  See <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generators.7.html">cmake-generators</a>(7)</u>.

       The name of the generator that is being used to generate the build files.  (e.g.  <b>Unix</b> <b>Makefiles</b>,  <b>Ninja</b>,
       etc.)

       The value of this variable should never be modified by project code.  A generator may be selected via the
       <u>cmake</u> <u>-G</u> option, interactively in <u><a href="../man1/cmake-gui.1.html">cmake-gui</a>(1)</u>, or via the <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR</u> environment variable.

   <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       Generator-specific instance specification provided by user.

       Some CMake generators support selection of an instance of the native build system when multiple instances
       are  available.   If  the  user  specifies  an  instance  (e.g.  by  setting  this cache entry or via the
       <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE</u> environment variable), or after a default instance is chosen when a  build  tree
       is first configured, the value will be available in this variable.

       The  value  of this variable should never be modified by project code.  A toolchain file specified by the
       <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u> variable may initialize <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE</b> as a cache  entry.   Once  a  given
       build  tree  has  been  initialized  with  a  particular  value for this variable, changing the value has
       undefined behavior.

       Instance specification is supported only on specific generators.

   <b>Visual</b> <b>Studio</b> <b>Instance</b> <b>Selection</b>
       <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u>  support  instance  specification  for  Visual  Studio  2017  and  above.   The
       <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE</b>  variable may be set as a cache entry selecting an instance of Visual Studio via
       one of the following forms:

       • <b>location</b>

       • <b>location[,key=value]*</b>

       • <b>key=value[,key=value]*</b>

       The <b>location</b> specifies the absolute path to the top-level directory of the VS installation.

       The <b>key=value</b> pairs form a comma-separated list of options to specify details of the instance  selection.
       Supported pairs are:

       <b>version=&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;date&gt;.&lt;build&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.23.

              Specify the 4-component VS Build Version, a.k.a. Build Number.

              The components are:

              <b>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;</b>
                 The VS major and minor version numbers.  These are the same as the release version numbers.

              <b>&lt;date&gt;</b>
                 A  build date in the format <b>MMMDD</b>, where <b>MMM</b> is a month index since an epoch used by Microsoft,
                 and <b>DD</b> is a day in that month.

              <b>&lt;build&gt;</b>
                 A build index on the day represented by <b>&lt;date&gt;</b>.

              The build number is reported by <b>vswhere</b> as <b>installationVersion</b>.   For  example,  VS  16.11.10  has
              build number <b>16.11.32126.315</b>.

       Added  in version 3.23: A portable VS instance, which is not known to the Visual Studio Installer, may be
       specified by providing both <b>location</b> and <b>version=</b>.

       If the value of <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE</b> is not specified explicitly by the user  or  a  toolchain  file,
       CMake queries the Visual Studio Installer to locate VS instances, chooses one, and sets the variable as a
       cache entry to hold the value persistently.  If an environment variable of the form <b>VS##0COMNTOOLS</b>, where
       <b>##</b> the Visual Studio major version number, is set and points to the <b>Common7/Tools</b> directory within one of
       the VS instances, that instance will be used.  Otherwise, if more than one VS instance is installed we do
       not define which one is chosen by default.

       The  VS version build number of the selected VS instance is provided in the <u>CMAKE_VS_VERSION_BUILD_NUMBER</u>
       variable.

   <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Generator-specific target platform specification provided by user.

       Some CMake generators support a target platform name to be given to the native build system to  choose  a
       compiler  toolchain.   If  the  user  specifies  a platform name (e.g. via the <u>cmake</u> <u>-A</u> option or via the
       <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM</u> environment variable) the value will be available in this variable.

       The value of this variable should never be modified by project code.  A toolchain file specified  by  the
       <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u>  variable may initialize <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM</b>.  Once a given build tree has been
       initialized with a particular value for this variable, changing the value has undefined behavior.

       Platform specification is supported only on specific generators:

       • For <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> with VS 2005 and above this specifies the target architecture.

       • For <u>Green</u> <u>Hills</u> <u>MULTI</u> this specifies the target architecture.

       See native build system documentation for allowed platform names.

   <b>Visual</b> <b>Studio</b> <b>Platform</b> <b>Selection</b>
       The <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> support platform specification using one of these forms:

       • <b>platform</b>

       • <b>platform[,key=value]*</b>

       • <b>key=value[,key=value]*</b>

       The <b>platform</b> specifies the target platform (VS target architecture), such as <b>x64</b>, <b>ARM64</b>, or  <b>Win32</b>.   The
       selected platform name is provided in the <u>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME</u> variable.

       The  <b>key=value</b>  pairs form a comma-separated list of options to specify generator-specific details of the
       platform selection.  Supported pairs are:

       <b>version=&lt;version&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              Specify the Windows SDK version to use.  This is supported by VS 2015  and  above  when  targeting
              Windows or Windows Store.  CMake will set the <u>CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION</u> variable to
              the selected SDK version.

              The <b>&lt;version&gt;</b> may be one of:

              <b>10.0</b>   Specify  that  any  10.0  SDK version may be used, and let Visual Studio pick one.  This is
                     supported by VS 2019 and above.

              <b>10.0.&lt;build&gt;.&lt;increment&gt;</b>
                     Specify the exact 4-component SDK version, e.g., <b>10.0.19041.0</b>.  The  specified  version  of
                     the    SDK    must    be    installed.     It    may    not    exceed    the    value    of
                     <u>CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION_MAXIMUM</u>, if that variable is set.

              <b>8.1</b>    Specify the 8.1 SDK version.  This is always supported by VS 2015.  On VS  2017  and  above
                     the 8.1 SDK must be installed.

              If   the   <b>version</b>  field  is  not  specified,  CMake  selects  a  version  as  described  in  the
              <u>CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION</u> variable documentation.

   <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</b>
       Native build system toolset specification provided by user.

       Some CMake generators support a toolset specification to tell the native build system  how  to  choose  a
       compiler.    If   the   user   specifies   a   toolset   (e.g.  via  the  <u>cmake</u>  <u>-T</u>  option  or  via  the
       <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</u> environment variable) the value will be available in this variable.

       The value of this variable should never be modified by project code.  A toolchain file specified  by  the
       <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u>  variable  may initialize <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</b>.  Once a given build tree has been
       initialized with a particular value for this variable, changing the value has undefined behavior.

       Toolset specification is supported only on specific generators:

       • <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> for VS 2010 and above

       • The <u>Xcode</u> generator for Xcode 3.0 and above

       • The <u>Green</u> <u>Hills</u> <u>MULTI</u> generator

       See native build system documentation for allowed toolset names.

   <b>Visual</b> <b>Studio</b> <b>Toolset</b> <b>Selection</b>
       The <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> support toolset specification using one of these forms:

       • <b>toolset</b>

       • <b>toolset[,key=value]*</b>

       • <b>key=value[,key=value]*</b>

       The  <b>toolset</b>  specifies  the  toolset  name.   The   selected   toolset   name   is   provided   in   the
       <u>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET</u> variable.

       The  <b>key=value</b>  pairs form a comma-separated list of options to specify generator-specific details of the
       toolset selection.  Supported pairs are:

       <b>cuda=&lt;version&gt;|&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Specify the CUDA toolkit version to use or the  path  to  a  standalone  CUDA  toolkit  directory.
              Supported  by VS 2010 and above. The version can only be used with the CUDA toolkit VS integration
              globally        installed.         See        the        <u>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_CUDA</u>        and
              <u>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_CUDA_CUSTOM_DIR</u> variables.

       <b>fortran=&lt;compiler&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.29.

              Specify  the Fortran compiler to use, among those that have the required Visual Studio Integration
              feature installed.  The value may be one of:

              <b>ifort</b>  Intel classic Fortran compiler.

              <b>ifx</b>    Intel oneAPI Fortran compiler.

              See the <u>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_FORTRAN</u> variable.

       <b>host=&lt;arch&gt;</b>
              Specify the host tools architecture as <b>x64</b> or <b>x86</b>.  Supported by  VS  2013  and  above.   See  the
              <u>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_HOST_ARCHITECTURE</u> variable.

       <b>version=&lt;version&gt;</b>
              Specify  the  toolset  version  to use.  Supported by VS 2017 and above with the specified toolset
              installed.  See the <u>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_VERSION</u> variable.

       <b>VCTargetsPath=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Specify an alternative <b>VCTargetsPath</b> value for Visual Studio project files.  This allows use of VS
              platform extension configuration files (<b>.props</b> and <b>.targets</b>) that are not installed with VS.

   <b>Visual</b> <b>Studio</b> <b>Toolset</b> <b>Customization</b>
       <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>unstable</b> <b>interfaces</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b>  <b>compatibility</b>  <b>guarantees</b>  because  they  hook  into  undocumented
       internal  CMake  implementation  details.   Institutions may use these to internally maintain support for
       non-public Visual Studio platforms and toolsets, but  must  accept  responsibility  to  make  updates  as
       changes are made to CMake.

       Additional <b>key=value</b> pairs are available:

       <b>customFlagTableDir=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              Specify  the  absolute  path  to  a directory from which to load custom flag tables stored as JSON
              documents with file names of the form <b>&lt;platform&gt;_&lt;toolset&gt;_&lt;tool&gt;.json</b> or  <b>&lt;platform&gt;_&lt;tool&gt;.json</b>,
              where  <b>&lt;platform&gt;</b>  is  the <u>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME</u>, <b>&lt;toolset&gt;</b> is the <u>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET</u>, and
              <b>&lt;tool&gt;</b> is the tool for which the flag table is meant.  <b>This</b> <b>naming</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b>  <b>an</b>  <b>internal</b>  <b>CMake</b>
              <b>implementation</b>  <b>detail.</b>   The  <b>&lt;tool&gt;</b>  names are undocumented.  The format of the <b>.json</b> flag table
              files is undocumented.

   <b>CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_PREFIX</b>
       The prefix for import libraries that you link to.

       The prefix to use for the name of an import library if used on this platform.

       <b>CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_PREFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;</b> overrides this for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_SUFFIX</b>
       The suffix for import libraries that you link to.

       The suffix to use for the end of an import library filename if used on this platform.

       <b>CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;</b> overrides this for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_JOB_POOL_COMPILE</b>
       This  variable  is  used  to  initialize  the  <u>JOB_POOL_COMPILE</u>  property  on  all   the   targets.   See
       <u>JOB_POOL_COMPILE</u> for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_JOB_POOL_LINK</b>
       This  variable is used to initialize the <u>JOB_POOL_LINK</u> property on all the targets. See <u>JOB_POOL_LINK</u> for
       additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_JOB_POOL_PRECOMPILE_HEADER</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>JOB_POOL_PRECOMPILE_HEADER</u>  property  on  all  the  targets.  See
       <u>JOB_POOL_PRECOMPILE_HEADER</u> for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_JOB_POOLS</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       If  the  <u>JOB_POOLS</u>  global  property  is  not  set, the value of this variable is used in its place.  See
       <u>JOB_POOLS</u> for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_AR</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       A wrapper around <b>ar</b> adding the appropriate <b>--plugin</b> option for the compiler.

       See also <u>CMAKE_AR</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_FRONTEND_VARIANT</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       Identification string of the compiler frontend variant.

       Some compilers have multiple, different frontends for accepting command line options.  (For example <b>Clang</b>
       originally only had a frontend compatible with the <b>GNU</b> compiler but since its port to Windows  (<b>Clang-Cl</b>)
       it  now  also supports a frontend compatible with <b>MSVC</b>.)  When CMake detects such a compiler it sets this
       variable to what would have  been  the  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ID</u>  for  the  compiler  whose  frontend  it
       resembles.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          In other words, this variable describes what command line options and language extensions the compiler
          frontend expects.

       Changed  in version 3.26: This variable is set for <b>GNU</b>, <b>MSVC</b>, and <b>AppleClang</b> compilers that have only one
       frontend variant.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LINKER</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       The full path to the linker for <b>LANG</b>.

       This is the command that will be used as the <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> linker.

       This variable is not guaranteed to be defined for all linkers or languages.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This variable is read-only. It must not be set by the user. To  select  a  specific  linker,  use  the
          <u>CMAKE_LINKER_TYPE</u> variable or the <u>LINKER_TYPE</u> target property.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LINKER_FRONTEND_VARIANT</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       Identification string of the linker frontend variant.

       Some  linkers  have  multiple, different frontends for accepting command line options.  For example, <b>LLVM</b>
       <b>LLD</b> originally only had a frontend compatible with the <b>GNU</b>  compiler,  but  since  its  port  to  Windows
       (<b>lld-link</b>),  it  now also supports a frontend compatible with <b>MSVC</b>.  When CMake detects such a linker, it
       sets this variable to what would have been  the  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LINKER_ID</u>  for  the  linker  whose
       frontend it resembles.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          In  other  words, this variable describes what command line options and language extensions the linker
          frontend expects.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LINKER_ID</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       Linker identification string.

       A short string unique to the linker vendor.  Possible values include:

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_SUFFIX</b>
       The suffix for libraries that you link to.

       The suffix to use for the end of a library filename, <b>.lib</b> on Windows.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       End a link line such that static system libraries are used.

       Some linkers support switches such as <b>-Bstatic</b> and <b>-Bdynamic</b> to determine whether to use static or shared
       libraries  for  <b>-lXXX</b>  options.   CMake  uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
       paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for  the  platform.   By  default
       CMake  adds an option at the end of the library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type back to
       its starting type.  This property switches the final linker search type to <b>-Bstatic</b> regardless of how  it
       started.

       This  variable  is used to initialize the target property <u>LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC</u> for all targets. If set,
       its value is also used by the <u>try_compile()</u> command.

       See also <u>CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Assume the linker looks for static libraries by default.

       Some linkers support switches such as <b>-Bstatic</b> and <b>-Bdynamic</b> to determine whether to use static or shared
       libraries for <b>-lXXX</b> options.  CMake uses these options to set the link  type  for  libraries  whose  full
       paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the platform.  By default the
       linker  search  type  is  assumed  to  be  <b>-Bdynamic</b> at the beginning of the library list.  This property
       switches the assumption to <b>-Bstatic</b>.  It is intended for use when linking an executable statically  (e.g.
       with the GNU <b>-static</b> option).

       This  variable  is  used  to initialize the target property <u>LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC</u> for all targets.  If
       set, its value is also used by the <u>try_compile()</u> command.

       See also <u>CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION</b>
       First version number component of the <u>CMAKE_VERSION</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM</b>
       Tool that can launch the native build system.  The value may be the full path to an  executable  or  just
       the tool name if it is expected to be in the <b>PATH</b>.

       The tool selected depends on the <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR</u> used to configure the project:

       • The  <u>Makefile</u>  <u>Generators</u>  set  this to <b>make</b>, <b>gmake</b>, or a generator-specific tool (e.g. <b>nmake</b> for <u>NMake</u>
         <u>Makefiles</u>).

         These generators store <b>CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM</b> in the CMake cache so that it may be edited by the user.

       • The <u>Ninja</u> generator sets this to <b>ninja</b>.

         This generator stores <b>CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM</b> in the CMake cache so that it may be edited by the user.

       • The <u>Xcode</u> generator sets this to <b>xcodebuild</b>.

         This generator prefers to lookup the build tool at build time rather than to  store  <b>CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM</b>
         in the CMake cache ahead of time.  This is because <b>xcodebuild</b> is easy to find.

         For  compatibility  with  versions  of  CMake  prior  to  3.2,  if  a  user  or project explicitly adds
         <b>CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM</b> to the CMake cache then CMake will use the specified value.

       • The <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> set this to the  full  path  to  <b>MSBuild.exe</b>  or  <b>devenv.com</b>.   (See  also
         variables <u>CMAKE_VS_MSBUILD_COMMAND</u> and <u>CMAKE_VS_DEVENV_COMMAND</u>.

         These  generators prefer to lookup the build tool at build time rather than to store <b>CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM</b>
         in the CMake cache ahead of time.  This is because the tools are version-specific and  can  be  located
         using  the  Visual  Studio Installer.  It is also necessary because the proper build tool may depend on
         the project content (e.g. the Intel Fortran plugin to Visual Studio requires <b>devenv.com</b>  to  build  its
         <b>.vfproj</b>   project   files   even   though   <b>MSBuild.exe</b>   is   normally   preferred   to   support  the
         <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</u>).

         For compatibility with versions  of  CMake  prior  to  3.0,  if  a  user  or  project  explicitly  adds
         <b>CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM</b> to the CMake cache then CMake will use the specified value if possible.

       • The  <u>Green</u>  <u>Hills</u>  <u>MULTI</u>  generator  sets this to the full path to <b>gbuild.exe(Windows)</b> or <b>gbuild(Linux)</b>
         based upon the toolset being used.

         Once the generator has initialized a particular  value  for  this  variable,  changing  the  value  has
         undefined behavior.

       The  <b>CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM</b>  variable  is  set  for use by project code.  The value is also used by the <u>cmake</u>
       <u>--build</u> and <u>ctest</u> <u>--build-and-test</u> tools to launch the native build process.

   <b>CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT</b>
       Added in version 3.2.

       The number of matches with the last regular expression.

       When a regular expression match is  used,  CMake  fills  in  <u>CMAKE_MATCH_&lt;n&gt;</u>  variables  with  the  match
       contents.  The <b>CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT</b> variable holds the number of match expressions when these are filled.

   <b>CMAKE_MATCH_&lt;n&gt;</b>
       Capture  group <b>&lt;n&gt;</b> matched by the last regular expression, for groups 0 through 9.  Group 0 is the entire
       match.  Groups 1 through 9 are the subexpressions captured by <b>()</b> syntax.

       When a regular expression match is  used,  CMake  fills  in  <b>CMAKE_MATCH_&lt;n&gt;</b>  variables  with  the  match
       contents.  The <u>CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT</u> variable holds the number of match expressions when these are filled.

   <b>CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION</b>
       The  <b>&lt;min&gt;</b>  version of CMake given to the most recent call to the <u>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)</u> command
       in the current variable scope or any parent variable scope.

   <b>CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION</b>
       Second version number component of the <u>CMAKE_VERSION</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_NETRC</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       This variable is used to initialize the <b>NETRC</b> option for the <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u>  and  <u>file(UPLOAD)</u>  commands.
       See those commands for additional information.

       This  variable  is  also  used  by  the  <u>ExternalProject</u>  and  <u>FetchContent</u> modules for internal calls to
       <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u>.

       The local option takes precedence over this variable.

   <b>CMAKE_NETRC_FILE</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       This variable is used to initialize  the  <b>NETRC_FILE</b>  option  for  the  <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u>  and  <u>file(UPLOAD)</u>
       commands.  See those commands for additional information.

       This  variable  is  also  used  by  the  <u>ExternalProject</u>  and  <u>FetchContent</u> modules for internal calls to
       <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u>.

       The local option takes precedence over this variable.

   <b>CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE</b>
       Full path to the CMake file that included the current one.

       While processing a CMake file loaded by <u>include()</u> or <u>find_package()</u> this variable contains the full  path
       to  the  file  including  it.   The top of the include stack is always the <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> for the current
       directory.  See also <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION</b>
       Third version number component of the <u>CMAKE_VERSION</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       The description of the top level project.

       This variable holds the description of the project as specified in the top level CMakeLists.txt file by a
       <u>project()</u> command.  In the event that the top level CMakeLists.txt contains multiple <u>project()</u> calls, the
       most  recently  called  one  from  that  top  level  CMakeLists.txt  will  determine   the   value   that
       <b>CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION</b> contains.  For example, consider the following top level CMakeLists.txt:

          cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
          project(First DESCRIPTION "I am First")
          project(Second DESCRIPTION "I am Second")
          add_subdirectory(sub)
          project(Third DESCRIPTION "I am Third")

       And <b>sub/CMakeLists.txt</b> with the following contents:

          project(SubProj DESCRIPTION "I am SubProj")
          message("CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION = ${CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}")

       The  most recently seen <u>project()</u> command from the top level CMakeLists.txt would be <b>project(Second</b> <b>...)</b>,
       so this will print:

          CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION = I am Second

       To obtain the description from the most recent call to <u>project()</u> in the current directory scope or above,
       see the <u>PROJECT_DESCRIPTION</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       The homepage URL of the top level project.

       This variable holds the homepage URL of the project as specified in the top level CMakeLists.txt file  by
       a  <u>project()</u>  command.  In the event that the top level CMakeLists.txt contains multiple <u>project()</u> calls,
       the most recently  called  one  from  that  top  level  CMakeLists.txt  will  determine  the  value  that
       <b>CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL</b> contains.  For example, consider the following top level CMakeLists.txt:

          cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
          project(First HOMEPAGE_URL "https://first.example.com")
          project(Second HOMEPAGE_URL "https://second.example.com")
          add_subdirectory(sub)
          project(Third HOMEPAGE_URL "https://third.example.com")

       And <b>sub/CMakeLists.txt</b> with the following contents:

          project(SubProj HOMEPAGE_URL "https://subproj.example.com")
          message("CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL = ${CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL}")

       The  most recently seen <u>project()</u> command from the top level CMakeLists.txt would be <b>project(Second</b> <b>...)</b>,
       so this will print:

          CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL = https://second.example.com

       To obtain the homepage URL from the most recent call to <u>project()</u>  in  the  current  directory  scope  or
       above, see the <u>PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME</b>
       The name of the top level project.

       This  variable  holds  the  name  of  the  project as specified in the top level CMakeLists.txt file by a
       <u>project()</u> command.  In the event that the top level CMakeLists.txt contains multiple <u>project()</u> calls, the
       most  recently  called  one  from  that  top  level  CMakeLists.txt  will   determine   the   name   that
       <b>CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME</b> contains.  For example, consider the following top level CMakeLists.txt:

          cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
          project(First)
          project(Second)
          add_subdirectory(sub)
          project(Third)

       And <b>sub/CMakeLists.txt</b> with the following contents:

          project(SubProj)
          message("CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME = ${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}")

       The  most  recently seen <u>project()</u> command from the top level CMakeLists.txt would be <b>project(Second)</b>, so
       this will print:

          CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME = Second

       To obtain the name from the most recent call to <u>project()</u> in the current directory scope  or  above,  see
       the <u>PROJECT_NAME</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       The version of the top level project.

       This  variable  holds  the  version of the project as specified in the top level CMakeLists.txt file by a
       <u>project()</u> command.  In the event that the top level CMakeLists.txt contains multiple <u>project()</u> calls, the
       most  recently  called  one  from  that  top  level  CMakeLists.txt  will  determine   the   value   that
       <b>CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION</b> contains.  For example, consider the following top level CMakeLists.txt:

          cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
          project(First VERSION 1.2.3)
          project(Second VERSION 3.4.5)
          add_subdirectory(sub)
          project(Third VERSION 6.7.8)

       And <b>sub/CMakeLists.txt</b> with the following contents:

          project(SubProj VERSION 1)
          message("CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION = ${CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION}")

       The  most recently seen <u>project()</u> command from the top level CMakeLists.txt would be <b>project(Second</b> <b>...)</b>,
       so this will print:

          CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION = 3.4.5

       To obtain the version from the most recent call to <u>project()</u> in the current directory scope or above, see
       the <u>PROJECT_VERSION</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       The major version of the top level project.

       This variable holds the major version of the project as specified in the top level CMakeLists.txt file by
       a <u>project()</u> command. Please see  <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION</u>  documentation  for  the  behavior  when  multiple
       <u>project()</u> commands are used in the sources.

   <b>CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       The minor version of the top level project.

       This variable holds the minor version of the project as specified in the top level CMakeLists.txt file by
       a  <u>project()</u>  command.  Please  see  <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION</u>  documentation  for the behavior when multiple
       <u>project()</u> commands are used in the sources.

   <b>CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       The patch version of the top level project.

       This variable holds the patch version of the project as specified in the top level CMakeLists.txt file by
       a <u>project()</u> command. Please see  <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION</u>  documentation  for  the  behavior  when  multiple
       <u>project()</u> commands are used in the sources.

   <b>CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       The tweak version of the top level project.

       This variable holds the tweak version of the project as specified in the top level CMakeLists.txt file by
       a  <u>project()</u>  command.  Please  see  <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION</u>  documentation  for the behavior when multiple
       <u>project()</u> commands are used in the sources.

   <b>CMAKE_RANLIB</b>
       Name of randomizing tool for static libraries.

       This specifies name of the program that randomizes libraries on UNIX, not used on  Windows,  but  may  be
       present.

   <b>CMAKE_ROOT</b>
       Install directory for running cmake.

       This  is  the  install  root  for the running CMake and the <b>Modules</b> directory can be found here.  This is
       commonly used in this format: <b>${CMAKE_ROOT}/Modules</b>

   <b>CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       Specify whether to report a message for each make rule.

       If set in the cache it is used to initialize the value of the <u>RULE_MESSAGES</u> property.  Users may  disable
       the  option  in  their  local  build  tree  to  disable  granular messages and report only as each target
       completes in Makefile builds.

   <b>CMAKE_SCRIPT_MODE_FILE</b>
       Full path to the <u>cmake</u> <u>-P</u> script file currently being processed.

       When run in <u>cmake</u> <u>-P</u> script mode, CMake sets this variable to the full path of the script file.  When run
       to configure a <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file, this variable is not set.

   <b>CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX</b>
       The prefix for shared libraries that you link to.

       The prefix to use for the name of a shared library, <b>lib</b> on UNIX.

       <b>CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;</b> overrides this for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX</b>
       The suffix for shared libraries that you link to.

       The suffix to use for the end of a shared library filename, <b>.dll</b> on Windows.

       <b>CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;</b> overrides this for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHIVE_SUFFIX</b>
       Added in version 3.31.

       The suffix for archived shared libraries that you link to.

       The suffix to use for the end of a archive containing a shared library, <b>.a</b> on AIX.

   <b>CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_PREFIX</b>
       The prefix for loadable modules that you link to.

       The prefix to use for the name of a loadable module on this platform.

       <b>CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_PREFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;</b> overrides this for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX</b>
       The suffix for shared libraries that you link to.

       The suffix to use for the end of a loadable module filename on this platform

       <b>CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;</b> overrides this for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P</b>
       Size of a <b>void</b> pointer.

       This is set to the size of a pointer on the target machine, and is determined when a compiled language is
       enabled.  If a 64-bit size is found, then the  library  search  path  is  modified  to  look  for  64-bit
       libraries first.

   <b>CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RULES</b>
       Whether to disable generation of installation rules.

       If  <b>TRUE</b>,  CMake will neither generate installation rules nor will it generate <b>cmake_install.cmake</b> files.
       This variable is <b>FALSE</b> by default.

   <b>CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH</b>
       If true, do not add run time path information.

       If this is set to <b>TRUE</b>, then the rpath information is not added to compiled executables.  The default  is
       to  add rpath information if the platform supports it.  This allows for easy running from the build tree.
       To omit RPATH in the install step, but not the build step, use <u>CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH</u> instead. To  omit
       RPATH in the build step, use <u>CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH</u>.

       For more information on RPATH handling see the <u>INSTALL_RPATH</u> and <u>BUILD_RPATH</u> target properties.

   <b>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</b>
       The path to the top level of the source tree.

       This  is  the  full path to the top level of the current CMake source tree.  For an in-source build, this
       would be the same as <u>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</u>.

       When run  in  <u>cmake</u>  <u>-P</u>  script  mode,  CMake  sets  the  variables  <u>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</u>,  <b>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</b>,
       <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u> and <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u> to the current working directory.

   <b>CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX</b>
       The prefix for static libraries that you link to.

       The prefix to use for the name of a static library, <b>lib</b> on UNIX.

       <b>CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;</b> overrides this for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX</b>
       The suffix for static libraries that you link to.

       The suffix to use for the end of a static library filename, <b>.lib</b> on Windows.

       <b>CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;</b> overrides this for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_Swift_COMPILATION_MODE</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       Specify  how  Swift  compiles  a  target.  This variable is used to initialize the <u>Swift_COMPILATION_MODE</u>
       property on targets as they are created.

       The allowed values are:

       <b>incremental</b>
              Compiles each Swift source in the module separately, resulting in better parallelism in the build.
              The compiler emits additional information into the build directory improving  rebuild  performance
              when  small  changes are made to the source between rebuilds. This is the best option to use while
              iterating on changes in a project.

       <b>wholemodule</b>
              Whole-module optimizations are slowest to compile, but results in the most optimized library.  The
              entire  context  is  loaded  into once instance of the compiler, so there is no parallelism across
              source files in the module.

       <b>singlefile</b>
              Compiles each source in a Swift modules separately, resulting in better  parallelism.  Unlike  the
              <b>incremental</b>  build mode, no additional information is emitted by the compiler during the build, so
              rebuilding after making small changes to the source file will not run faster. This  option  should
              be used sparingly, preferring <b>incremental</b> builds, unless working around a compiler bug.

       Use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> to support per-configuration specification. For example, the code:

          set(CMAKE_Swift_COMPILATION_MODE
            "$&lt;IF:$&lt;CONFIG:Release&gt;,wholemodule,incremental&gt;")

       sets  the default Swift compilation mode to wholemodule mode when building a release configuration and to
       incremental mode in other configurations.

       If  this  variable  is  not  set  then  the  <u>Swift_COMPILATION_MODE</u>  target  property  will  not  be  set
       automatically. If that property is unset then CMake uses the default value <b>incremental</b> to build the Swift
       source files.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This  property  only  has  effect  when  policy  <u>CMP0157</u> is set to <b>NEW</b> prior to the first <u>project()</u> or
          <u>enable_language()</u> command that enables the Swift language.

   <b>CMAKE_Swift_MODULE_DIRECTORY</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       Swift module output directory.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>Swift_MODULE_DIRECTORY</u> property on  all  the  targets.   See  the
       target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_Swift_NUM_THREADS</b>
       Added in version 3.15.1.

       Number of threads for parallel compilation for Swift targets.

       This  variable  controls  the number of parallel jobs that the swift driver creates for building targets.
       If not specified, it will default to the number of logical CPUs on the host.

   <b>CMAKE_TEST_LAUNCHER</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>TEST_LAUNCHER</u> target property of executable targets as  they  are
       created.   It  is used to specify a launcher for running tests, added by the <u>add_test()</u> command, that run
       an executable target.

       If this variable contains a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u>, then the first value is the command  and  remaining
       values are its arguments.

       This variable can be initialized via an <u>CMAKE_TEST_LAUNCHER</u> environment variable.

   <b>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</b>
       Path to toolchain file supplied to <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u>.

       This variable is specified on the command line when cross-compiling with CMake.  It is the path to a file
       which is read early in the CMake run and which specifies locations for compilers and toolchain utilities,
       and other target platform and compiler related information.

       Relative  paths  are  allowed  and  are  interpreted first as relative to the build directory, and if not
       found, relative to the source directory.

       This is initialized by the <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u> environment variable if it is set when a new  build  tree
       is first created.

       See  the  <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES</u>  variable for setting other things not directly related to the
       toolchain.

   <b>CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION</b>
       Defined to <b>0</b> for compatibility with code written for older CMake versions that may  have  defined  higher
       values.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          In CMake versions 2.8.2 through 2.8.12, this variable holds the fourth version number component of the
          <u>CMAKE_VERSION</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE</b>
       Enable verbose output from Makefile builds.

       This  variable  is  a  cache entry initialized (to <b>FALSE</b>) by the <u>project()</u> command.  Users may enable the
       option in their local build tree to get more verbose output from Makefile builds and  show  each  command
       line as it is launched.

   <b>CMAKE_VERSION</b>
       The CMake version string as three non-negative integer components separated by <b>.</b> and possibly followed by
       <b>-</b>  and  other  information.  The first two components represent the feature level and the third component
       represents either a bug-fix level or development date.

       Release versions and release candidate versions of CMake use the format:

          &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;[-rc&lt;n&gt;]

       where the <b>&lt;patch&gt;</b> component is less than <b>20000000</b>.  Development versions of CMake use the format:

          &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;date&gt;[-&lt;id&gt;]

       where the <b>&lt;date&gt;</b> component is of format <b>CCYYMMDD</b> and <b>&lt;id&gt;</b> may contain arbitrary  text.   This  represents
       development as of a particular date following the <b>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;</b> feature release.

       Individual component values are also available in variables:

       • <u>CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION</u>

       Use   the   <u>if()</u>   command   <b>VERSION_LESS</b>,   <b>VERSION_GREATER</b>,   <b>VERSION_EQUAL</b>,   <b>VERSION_LESS_EQUAL</b>,   or
       <b>VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL</b>  operators  to  compare  version  string  values  against  <b>CMAKE_VERSION</b>  using   a
       component-wise  test.   Version component values may be 10 or larger so do not attempt to compare version
       strings as floating-point numbers.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          CMake versions 2.8.2 through 2.8.12 used three components for the  feature  level.   Release  versions
          represented  the  bug-fix level in a fourth component, i.e. <b>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;[.&lt;tweak&gt;][-rc&lt;n&gt;]</b>.
          Development  versions   represented   the   development   date   in   the   fourth   component,   i.e.
          <b>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;.&lt;date&gt;[-&lt;id&gt;]</b>.

          CMake  versions  prior  to  2.8.2  used  three  components  for  the  feature level and had no bug-fix
          component.     Release     versions     used     an     even-valued     second     component,     i.e.
          <b>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;even-minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;[-rc&lt;n&gt;]</b>.   Development  versions used an odd-valued second component with
          the development date as the third component, i.e. <b>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;odd-minor&gt;.&lt;date&gt;</b>.

          The <b>CMAKE_VERSION</b> variable is defined by CMake 2.6.3 and higher.  Earlier versions  defined  only  the
          individual component variables.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_DEVENV_COMMAND</b>
       The <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> set this variable to the <b>devenv.com</b> command installed with the corresponding
       Visual Studio version.

       This variable is not defined by other generators even if <b>devenv.com</b> is installed on the computer.

       See also the <u>CMAKE_VS_MSBUILD_COMMAND</u> and <u>CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM</u> variables.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_MSBUILD_COMMAND</b>
       The  <u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u>  set  this  variable  to  the  <b>MSBuild.exe</b>  command  installed  with  the
       corresponding Visual Studio version.

       This variable is not defined by other generators even if <b>MSBuild.exe</b> is installed on the computer.

       See also the <u>CMAKE_VS_DEVENV_COMMAND</u> and <u>CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM</u> variables.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_NsightTegra_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       When using a Visual Studio generator with the <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u> variable set to  <b>Android</b>,  this  variable
       contains the version number of the installed NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio Edition.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_NUGET_PACKAGE_RESTORE</b>
       Added in version 3.23.

       When  using  a  Visual  Studio  generator,  this  cache variable controls if msbuild should automatically
       attempt to  restore  NuGet  packages  prior  to  a  build.  NuGet  packages  can  be  defined  using  the
       <u>VS_PACKAGE_REFERENCES</u>  property  on  a target. If no package references are defined, this setting will do
       nothing.

       The command line option <u>--resolve-package-references</u> can be used alternatively  to  control  the  resolve
       behavior globally.  This option will take precedence over the cache variable.

       Targets  that use the <u>DOTNET_SDK</u> are required to run a restore before building. Disabling this option may
       cause the build to fail in such projects.

       This setting is stored as a cache entry. Default value is <b>ON</b>.

       See also the <u>VS_PACKAGE_REFERENCES</u> property.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Visual Studio target platform name used by the current generator.

       VS 8 and above allow project files to specify a target platform.  CMake provides the name of  the  chosen
       platform in this variable.  See the <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM</u> variable for details.

       See also the <u>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME_DEFAULT</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME_DEFAULT</b>
       Added in version 3.14.3.

       Default  for  the  Visual  Studio  target platform name for the current generator without considering the
       value of the <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM</u> variable.  For <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> for VS 2017 and below  this
       is always <b>Win32</b>.  For VS 2019 and above this is based on the host platform.

       See also the <u>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET</b>
       Visual Studio Platform Toolset name.

       VS 10 and above use MSBuild under the hood and support multiple compiler toolchains.  CMake may specify a
       toolset  explicitly,  such as <b>v110</b> for VS 11 or <b>Windows7.1SDK</b> for 64-bit support in VS 10 Express.  CMake
       provides the name of the chosen toolset in this variable.

       See the <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</u> variable for details.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_CUDA</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit version whose Visual Studio toolset to use.

       The <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> for VS 2010 and above support using  a  CUDA  toolset  provided  by  a  CUDA
       Toolkit.   The  toolset version number may be specified by a field in <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</u> of the form
       <b>cuda=8.0</b>. Or it is automatically detected if a path to a standalone CUDA directory is  specified  in  the
       form <b>cuda=C:\path\to\cuda</b>.  If none is specified CMake will choose a default version.  CMake provides the
       selected  CUDA  toolset  version in this variable.  The value may be empty if no CUDA Toolkit with Visual
       Studio integration is installed.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_CUDA_CUSTOM_DIR</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Path to standalone NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (eg. extracted from installer).

       The <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> for VS 2010 and above support using a standalone (non-installed) NVIDIA CUDA
       toolkit.   The  path  may  be  specified  by   a   field   in   <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</u>   of   the   form
       <b>cuda=C:\path\to\cuda</b>.  The given directory must at least contain the nvcc compiler in path <b>.\bin</b> and must
       provide  Visual  Studio integration files in path <b>.\extras\visual_studio_integration\</b> <b>MSBuildExtensions\</b>.
       One can create a standalone CUDA toolkit directory by either opening a installer with 7zip or copying the
       files that are extracted by the running installer. The value may be empty if no path to a standalone CUDA
       Toolkit was specified.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_FORTRAN</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       Fortran compiler to be used by Visual Studio projects.

       <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> support selecting among Fortran compilers that have the required  Visual  Studio
       Integration  feature  installed.   The compiler may be specified by a field in <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</u> of
       the form <b>fortran=...</b>. CMake provides the selected Fortran compiler in this variable.  The  value  may  be
       empty if the field was not specified.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_HOST_ARCHITECTURE</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Visual Studio preferred tool architecture.

       The  <u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u>  for  VS  2013  and  above support using either the 32-bit or 64-bit host
       toolchains by specifying a <b>host=x86</b> or <b>host=x64</b>  value  in  the  <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</u>  option.   CMake
       provides the selected toolchain architecture preference in this variable (<b>x86</b>, <b>x64</b>, <b>ARM64</b> or empty).

   <b>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       Visual Studio Platform Toolset version.

       The  <u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u> for VS 2017 and above allow to select minor versions of the same toolset.
       The toolset version  number  may  be  specified  by  a  field  in  <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</u>  of  the  form
       <b>version=14.11</b>.  If  none  is  specified CMake will choose a default toolset. The value may be empty if no
       minor version was selected and the default is used.

       If  the   value   is   not   empty,   it   is   the   version   number   that   MSBuild   uses   in   its
       <b>Microsoft.VCToolsVersion.*.props</b> file names.

       Added  in version 3.19.7: VS 16.9's toolset may also be specified as <b>14.28.16.9</b> because VS 16.10 uses the
       file name <b>Microsoft.VCToolsVersion.14.28.16.9.props</b>.

   <b>Three-Component</b> <b>MSVC</b> <b>Toolset</b> <b>Versions</b>
       Added in version 3.19.7.

       The <b>version=</b> field may be given a three-component toolset version such as  <b>14.28.29910</b>,  and  CMake  will
       convert  it  to  the  name  used  by  MSBuild  <b>Microsoft.VCToolsVersion.*.props</b> files.  This is useful to
       distinguish between VS 16.8's <b>14.28.29333</b> toolset and VS 16.9's <b>14.28.29910</b>  toolset.   It  also  matches
       <b>vcvarsall</b>'s <b>-vcvars_ver=</b> behavior.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER</b>
       Added in version 3.22.

       Visual Studio target framework identifier.

       In   some   cases,   the   <u>Visual</u>   <u>Studio</u>   <u>Generators</u>  may  use  an  explicit  value  for  the  MSBuild
       <b>TargetFrameworkIdentifier</b> setting in <b>.csproj</b> files.  CMake provides the chosen value in this variable.

       See also <u>CMAKE_VS_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION</u> and <u>CMAKE_VS_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_TARGETS_VERSION</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_TARGETS_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.22.

       Visual Studio target framework targets version.

       In  some  cases,  the  <u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u>  may  use   an   explicit   value   for   the   MSBuild
       <b>TargetFrameworkTargetsVersion</b>  setting  in  <b>.csproj</b>  files.   CMake  provides  the  chosen  value in this
       variable.

       See also <u>CMAKE_VS_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION</u> and <u>CMAKE_VS_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.22.

       Visual Studio target framework version.

       In  some  cases,  the  <u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u>  may  use   an   explicit   value   for   the   MSBuild
       <b>TargetFrameworkVersion</b> setting in <b>.csproj</b> files.  CMake provides the chosen value in this variable.

       See   the   <u>CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION</u>  variable  and  <u>DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION</u>  target
       property to specify custom <b>TargetFrameworkVersion</b> values for project targets.

       See also <u>CMAKE_VS_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER</u> and <u>CMAKE_VS_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_TARGETS_VERSION</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES</b>
       Added in version 3.30.

       Indicate to <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> what  configurations  are  considered  debug  configurations.   This
       controls the <b>UseDebugLibraries</b> setting in each configuration of a <b>.vcxproj</b> file.

       The  "Use  Debug  Libraries"  setting in Visual Studio projects, despite its specific-sounding name, is a
       general-purpose indicator of what configurations are  considered  debug  configurations.   In  standalone
       projects,  this  may  affect  MSBuild's  default  selection  of MSVC runtime library, optimization flags,
       runtime checks, and  similar  settings.   In  CMake  projects  those  settings  are  typically  generated
       explicitly  based  on  the  project's  specification,  e.g.,  the  MSVC  runtime library is controlled by
       <u>CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</u>.  However, the <b>UseDebugLibraries</b> indicator is useful  for  reference  by  both
       humans and tools, and may also affect the behavior of platform-specific SDKs.

       Set  <b>CMAKE_VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES</b>  to  a  true  or  false value to indicate whether each configuration is
       considered a debug configuration.  The value may  also  be  the  empty  string  (<b>""</b>)  in  which  case  no
       <b>UseDebugLibraries</b> will be added explicitly by CMake, and MSBuild will use its default value, <b>false</b>.

       Use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> for per-configuration specification.  For example, the code:

          set(CMAKE_VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES "$&lt;CONFIG:Debug,Custom&gt;")

       indicates  that  all  following  targets  consider  their "Debug" and "Custom" configurations to be debug
       configurations, and their other configurations to be non-debug configurations.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES</u>  property  on  all  targets  as  they  are
       created.  It is also propagated by calls to the <u>try_compile()</u> command into its test project.

       If  this  variable is not set then the <u>VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES</u> property will not be set automatically.  If
       that property is not set then CMake generates  <b>UseDebugLibraries</b>  using  heuristics  to  determine  which
       configurations are debug configurations.  See policy <u>CMP0162</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_VERSION_BUILD_NUMBER</b>
       Added in version 3.26.

       Visual Studio version.

       <u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u>  for  VS  2017  and above set this variable to the Visual Studio version build
       number in the format <b>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;date&gt;.&lt;build&gt;</b>.

       The components are:

       <b>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;</b>
          The VS major and minor version numbers.  These are the same as the release version numbers.

       <b>&lt;date&gt;</b>
          A build date in the format <b>MMMDD</b>, where <b>MMM</b> is a month index since an epoch used by Microsoft, and  <b>DD</b>
          is a day in that month.

       <b>&lt;build&gt;</b>
          A build index on the day represented by <b>&lt;date&gt;</b>.

       The  build  number  is  reported  by  <b>vswhere</b> as <b>installationVersion</b>.  For example, VS 16.11.10 has build
       number <b>16.11.32126.315</b>.

       See also the <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_MIN_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       Tell <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> to use the given Windows Target Platform Minimum Version.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_MIN_VERSION</u> property  on  all  targets
       when they are created.  See that target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Visual Studio Windows Target Platform Version.

       When targeting Windows 10 and above, <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> for VS 2015 and above support specification
       of a Windows SDK version:

       • If  <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM</u>  specifies  a  <b>version=</b>  field,  as  documented  by <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Platform</u>
         <u>Selection</u>, that SDK version is selected.

       • Otherwise, if the <b>WindowsSDKVersion</b> environment variable is set  to  an  available  SDK  version,  that
         version  is selected.  This is intended for use in environments established by <b>vcvarsall.bat</b> or similar
         scripts.

         Added in version 3.27: This is enabled by policy <u>CMP0149</u>.

       • Otherwise, if <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION</u> is set to an available SDK version, that version is selected.

         Changed in version 3.27: This is disabled by policy <u>CMP0149</u>.

       • Otherwise, CMake uses the latest Windows SDK version available.

       The chosen Windows target version number is provided in <b>CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION</b>.  If  no
       Windows 10 SDK is available this value will be empty.

       One  may  set  a <b>CMAKE_WINDOWS_KITS_10_DIR</b> <u>environment</u> <u>variable</u> to an absolute path to tell CMake to look
       for Windows 10 SDKs in a custom location.  The specified directory is expected to contain  <b>Include/10.0.*</b>
       directories.

       See also <u>CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION_MAXIMUM</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION_MAXIMUM</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       Override the <u>Windows</u> <u>10</u> <u>SDK</u> <u>Maximum</u> <u>Version</u> <u>for</u> <u>VS</u> <u>2015</u> and beyond.

       The  <b>CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION_MAXIMUM</b>  variable  may  be  set to a false value (e.g. <b>OFF</b>,
       <b>FALSE</b>, or <b>0</b>) or the SDK version to use as the maximum (e.g. <b>10.0.14393.0</b>).  If unset, the default depends
       on which version of Visual Studio is targeted by the current generator.

       This    can    be    used    to    exclude    Windows    SDK    versions    from    consideration     for
       <u>CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_WINDOWS_KMDF_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.31.

       Specify the <u>Kernel-Mode</u> <u>Drive</u> <u>Framework</u> target version.

       A   <u>toolchain</u>   <u>file</u>   that   sets   <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u>   to   <b>WindowsKernelModeDriver</b>   must   also   set
       <b>CMAKE_WINDOWS_KMDF_VERSION</b> to specify the KMDF target version.

   <b>CMAKE_XCODE_BUILD_SYSTEM</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       Xcode build system selection.

       The <u>Xcode</u> generator defines this variable to indicate which variant of the Xcode  build  system  will  be
       used.   The  value  is  the  version of Xcode in which the corresponding build system first became mature
       enough for use by CMake.  The possible values are:

       <b>1</b>      The original Xcode build system.  This is the default when using Xcode 11.x or below and supported
              up to Xcode 13.x.

       <b>12</b>     The Xcode "new build system" introduced by Xcode 10.  It became mature enough for use by CMake  in
              Xcode 12.  This is the default when using Xcode 12.x or above.

       The  <b>CMAKE_XCODE_BUILD_SYSTEM</b>  variable is informational and should not be modified by project code.  See
       the <u>Toolset</u> <u>and</u> <u>Build</u> <u>System</u> <u>Selection</u> documentation section to select the Xcode build system.

   <b>CMAKE_XCODE_PLATFORM_TOOLSET</b>
       Xcode compiler selection.

       <u>Xcode</u> supports selection of a compiler from one of the installed toolsets.  CMake provides  the  name  of
       the chosen toolset in this variable, if any is explicitly selected (e.g.  via the <u>cmake</u> <u>-T</u> option).

   <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_BINARY_DIR</b>
       Top level binary directory for the named project.

       A  variable  is  created with the name used in the <u>project()</u> command, and is the binary directory for the
       project.  This can be useful when <u>add_subdirectory()</u> is used to connect several projects.

   <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_DESCRIPTION</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       Value given to the <b>DESCRIPTION</b> option of the most recent call to the <u>project()</u> command with project  name
       <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;</b>, if any.

   <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_HOMEPAGE_URL</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       Value given to the <b>HOMEPAGE_URL</b> option of the most recent call to the <u>project()</u> command with project name
       <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;</b>, if any.

   <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_IS_TOP_LEVEL</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       A boolean variable indicating whether the named project was called in a top level <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file.

       To  obtain  the value from the most recent call to <u>project()</u> in the current directory scope or above, see
       the <u>PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL</u> variable.

       The variable value will be true in:

       • the top-level directory of the project

       • the top-level directory of an external project added by <u>ExternalProject</u>

       • a directory added by <u>add_subdirectory()</u> that does not also contain a <u>project()</u> call

       • a directory added by <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u>, if the fetched content does not contain a  <u>project()</u>
         call

       The variable value will be false in:

       • a directory added by <u>add_subdirectory()</u> that also contains a <u>project()</u> call

       • a directory added by <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u>, if the fetched content contains a <u>project()</u> call

   <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_SOURCE_DIR</b>
       Top level source directory for the named project.

       A  variable  is  created with the name used in the <u>project()</u> command, and is the source directory for the
       project.  This can be useful when <u>add_subdirectory()</u> is used to connect several projects.

   <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION</b>
       Value given to the <b>VERSION</b> option of the most recent call to the  <u>project()</u>  command  with  project  name
       <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;</b>, if any.

       See also the component-wise version variables <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR</u>, <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION_MINOR</u>,
       <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION_PATCH</u>, and <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION_TWEAK</u>.

   <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR</b>
       First version number component of the <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION</u> variable as set by the <u>project()</u> command.

   <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION_MINOR</b>
       Second version number component of the <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION</u> variable as set by the <u>project()</u> command.

   <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION_PATCH</b>
       Third version number component of the <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION</u> variable as set by the <u>project()</u> command.

   <b>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION_TWEAK</b>
       Fourth version number component of the <u>&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_VERSION</u> variable as set by the <u>project()</u> command.

   <b>PROJECT_BINARY_DIR</b>
       Full path to build directory for project.

       This is the binary directory of the most recent <u>project()</u> command.

   <b>PROJECT_DESCRIPTION</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Short project description given to the project command.

       This  is  the  description  given  to the most recently called <u>project()</u> command in the current directory
       scope or above.  To obtain the description of the top level project,  see  the  <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION</u>
       variable.

   <b>PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       The homepage URL of the project.

       This  is  the  homepage  URL given to the most recently called <u>project()</u> command in the current directory
       scope or above.  To obtain the homepage URL of the top level project, see the  <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL</u>
       variable.

   <b>PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       A  boolean variable indicating whether the most recently called <u>project()</u> command in the current scope or
       above was in the top level <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file.

       Some modules should only be included as part of the top level <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file to not cause unintended
       side effects in the build tree, and this variable can be used to conditionally  execute  such  code.  For
       example, consider the <u>CTest</u> module, which creates targets and options:

          project(MyProject)
          ...
          if(PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL)
            include(CTest)
          endif()

       The variable value will be true in:

       • the top-level directory of the project

       • the top-level directory of an external project added by <u>ExternalProject</u>

       • a directory added by <u>add_subdirectory()</u> that does not also contain a <u>project()</u> call

       • a  directory added by <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u>, if the fetched content does not contain a <u>project()</u>
         call

       The variable value will be false in:

       • a directory added by <u>add_subdirectory()</u> that also contains a <u>project()</u> call

       • a directory added by <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u>, if the fetched content contains a <u>project()</u> call

   <b>PROJECT_NAME</b>
       Name of the project given to the project command.

       This is the name given to the most recently called <u>project()</u> command in the current  directory  scope  or
       above.  To obtain the name of the top level project, see the <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME</u> variable.

   <b>PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR</b>
       This  is  the  source  directory  of the last call to the <u>project()</u> command made in the current directory
       scope or one of its parents. Note, it is not affected by calls to <u>project()</u> made within a child directory
       scope (i.e. from within a call to <u>add_subdirectory()</u> from the current scope).

   <b>PROJECT_VERSION</b>
       Value given to the <b>VERSION</b> option of the most recent call to the <u>project()</u> command, if any.

       See   also   the   component-wise   version   variables   <u>PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR</u>,   <u>PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR</u>,
       <u>PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH</u>, and <u>PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK</u>.

   <b>PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR</b>
       First version number component of the <u>PROJECT_VERSION</u> variable as set by the <u>project()</u> command.

   <b>PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR</b>
       Second version number component of the <u>PROJECT_VERSION</u> variable as set by the <u>project()</u> command.

   <b>PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH</b>
       Third version number component of the <u>PROJECT_VERSION</u> variable as set by the <u>project()</u> command.

   <b>PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK</b>
       Fourth version number component of the <u>PROJECT_VERSION</u> variable as set by the <u>project()</u> command.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b> <b>THAT</b> <b>CHANGE</b> <b>BEHAVIOR</b></h4><pre>
   <b>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</b>
       Tell  <u>add_library()</u>  to  default  to  <b>SHARED</b>  libraries, instead of <b>STATIC</b> libraries, when called with no
       explicit library type.

       Calls to <u>add_library()</u> without any explicit library type check  the  current  <b>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</b>  variable
       value.  If it is true, then the default library type is <b>SHARED</b>.  Otherwise, the default is <b>STATIC</b>.

       For example, the code:

          add_library(example ${sources})

       behaves as if written

          if(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS)
            add_library(example SHARED ${sources})
          else()
            add_library(example STATIC ${sources})
          endif()

       CMake  does not define <b>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</b> by default, but projects often create a cache entry for it using
       the <u>option()</u> command:

          option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS "Build using shared libraries" ON)

       This provides a switch that users can control, e.g., with <u>cmake</u> <u>-D</u>.  If adding  such  an  option  to  the
       project,  do  so  in  the  top  level  <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file, before any <u>add_library()</u> calls.  Note that if
       bringing external dependencies directly into the build, such as with <u>FetchContent</u> or  a  direct  call  to
       <u>add_subdirectory()</u>,  and  one of those dependencies has such a call to <u>option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</u> <u>...)</u>, the
       top level project must also call <u>option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</u>  <u>...)</u>  before  bringing  in  its  dependencies.
       Failure to do so can lead to different behavior between the first and subsequent CMake runs.

   <b>CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES</b>
       List of files which have been installed using an <b>ABSOLUTE</b> <b>DESTINATION</b> path.

       This  variable  is defined by CMake-generated <b>cmake_install.cmake</b> scripts.  It can be used (read-only) by
       programs or scripts that source those install scripts.  This is  used  by  some  CPack  generators  (e.g.
       RPM).

   <b>CMAKE_ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND_DEPENDS_EXPLICIT_ONLY</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       Whether to enable the <b>DEPENDS_EXPLICIT_ONLY</b> option by default in <u>add_custom_command()</u>.

       This variable affects the default behavior of the <u>add_custom_command()</u> command.  Setting this variable to
       <b>ON</b> is equivalent to using the <b>DEPENDS_EXPLICIT_ONLY</b> option in all uses of that command.

       See also <u>CMAKE_OPTIMIZE_DEPENDENCIES</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</b>
       <u>Semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  of  directories specifying a search path for macOS application bundles used by
       the <u>find_program()</u>, and <u>find_package()</u> commands.

       There is also an environment variable <u>CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</u>, which is used as an additional list of search
       directories.

   <b>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</b>
       Specifies the build type  on  single-configuration  generators  (e.g.   <u>Makefile</u>  <u>Generators</u>  or  <u>Ninja</u>).
       Typical  values include <b>Debug</b>, <b>Release</b>, <b>RelWithDebInfo</b> and <b>MinSizeRel</b>, but custom build types can also be
       defined.

       This variable is initialized by the first <u>project()</u> or <u>enable_language()</u> command called in a project when
       a new build tree is first created.  If the <u>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</u> environment variable is  set,  its  value  is
       used.   Otherwise,  a toolchain-specific default is chosen when a language is enabled.  The default value
       is often an empty string, but this is usually not desirable and one of the other standard build types  is
       usually more appropriate.

       Depending   on   the   situation,  the  value  of  this  variable  may  be  treated  case-sensitively  or
       case-insensitively.  See <u>Build</u> <u>Configurations</u> for discussion of this and other related topics.

       For multi-config generators, see <u>CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_CLANG_VFS_OVERLAY</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       When cross compiling for windows with clang-cl, this variable can be an absolute path pointing to a clang
       virtual file system yaml file, which will enable clang-cl to resolve  windows  header  names  on  a  case
       sensitive file system.

   <b>CMAKE_CODEBLOCKS_COMPILER_ID</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       Change the compiler id in the generated CodeBlocks project files.

       CodeBlocks uses its own compiler id string which differs from <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ID</u>.  If this variable
       is  left  empty,  CMake  tries  to  recognize  the  CodeBlocks  compiler id automatically.  Otherwise the
       specified string is used in the CodeBlocks project file.  See  the  CodeBlocks  documentation  for  valid
       compiler id strings.

       Other IDEs like QtCreator that also use the CodeBlocks generator may ignore this setting.

   <b>CMAKE_CODEBLOCKS_EXCLUDE_EXTERNAL_FILES</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       Change the way the CodeBlocks generator creates project files.

       If  this variable evaluates to <b>ON</b> the generator excludes from the project file any files that are located
       outside the project root.

   <b>CMAKE_CODELITE_USE_TARGETS</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Change the way the CodeLite generator creates projectfiles.

       If this variable evaluates to <b>ON</b> at the end of the top-level <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file, the  generator  creates
       projectfiles based on targets rather than projects.

   <b>CMAKE_COLOR_DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       Enable color diagnostics throughout.

       This variable uses three states: <b>ON</b>, <b>OFF</b> and not defined.

       When not defined:

       • <u>Makefile</u>  <u>Generators</u> initialize the <u>CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE</u> variable to <b>ON</b>.  It controls color buildsystem
         messages.

       • GNU/Clang compilers are not invoked with any color diagnostics flag.

       When <b>ON</b>:

       • <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> produce  color  buildsystem  messages  by  default.   <u>CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE</u>  is  not
         initialized, but may be explicitly set to <b>OFF</b> to disable color buildsystem messages.

       • GNU/Clang compilers are invoked with a flag enabling color diagnostics (<b>-fcolor-diagnostics</b>).

       When <b>OFF</b>:

       • <u>Makefile</u>  <u>Generators</u> do not produce color buildsystem messages by default.  <u>CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE</u> is not
         initialized, but may be explicitly set to <b>ON</b> to enable color buildsystem messages.

       • GNU/Clang compilers are invoked with a flag disabling color diagnostics (<b>-fno-color-diagnostics</b>).

       If  the  <u>CMAKE_COLOR_DIAGNOSTICS</u>  environment  variable  is  set,  its   value   is   used.    Otherwise,
       <b>CMAKE_COLOR_DIAGNOSTICS</b> is not defined by default.

   <b>CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE</b>
       Enables color output when using the <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u>.

       When enabled, the generated Makefiles will produce colored output.  Default is <b>ON</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES</b>
       Specifies  the  available  build  types  (configurations) on multi-config generators (e.g. <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u>,
       <u>Xcode</u>, or <u>Ninja</u> <u>Multi-Config</u>) as a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u>.  Typical  entries  include  <b>Debug</b>,  <b>Release</b>,
       <b>RelWithDebInfo</b> and <b>MinSizeRel</b>, but custom build types can also be defined.

       This variable is initialized by the first <u>project()</u> or <u>enable_language()</u> command called in a project when
       a  new  build  tree  is first created.  If the <u>CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES</u> environment variable is set, its
       value is used.  Otherwise, the default value is generator-specific.

       Depending  on  the  situation,  the  values  in  this  variable  may  be  treated   case-sensitively   or
       case-insensitively.  See <u>Build</u> <u>Configurations</u> for discussion of this and other related topics.

       For single-config generators, see <u>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_DEPENDS_IN_PROJECT_ONLY</b>
       Added in version 3.6.

       When  set  to <b>TRUE</b> in a directory, the build system produced by the <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> is set up to only
       consider dependencies on source files that appear either in the source  or  in  the  binary  directories.
       Changes to source files outside of these directories will not cause rebuilds.

       This  should  be  used  carefully in cases where some source files are picked up through external headers
       during the build.

   <b>CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt;</b>
       Variable for disabling <u>find_package()</u> calls.

       Every  non-<b>REQUIRED</b>  <u>find_package()</u>  call  in  a  project  can  be  disabled  by  setting  the   variable
       <b>CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt;</b>  to  <b>TRUE</b>.   This  can  be  used  to  build a project without an
       optional package, although that package is installed.

       This switch should be used during the initial CMake run.  Otherwise if the package has already been found
       in a previous CMake run, the variables which have been stored in the cache will still be there.  In  that
       case  it  is  recommended  to  remove the cache variables for this package from the cache using the cache
       editor or <u>cmake</u> <u>-U</u>.

       Note that this variable can lead to inconsistent results within the project.  Consider the case  where  a
       dependency  is  requested  via <u>find_package()</u> from two different places within the project.  If the first
       call   does   not   have   the   <b>REQUIRED</b>   keyword,   it   will   not   find   the    dependency    when
       <b>CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt;</b>  is  set  to true for that dependency.  The project will proceed
       under the assumption that the dependency isn't available.  If the second call elsewhere  in  the  project
       <u>does</u>  have  the <b>REQUIRED</b> keyword, it can succeed.  Two different parts of the same project have then seen
       opposite results for the same dependency.

       See also the <u>CMAKE_REQUIRE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt;</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_ECLIPSE_GENERATE_LINKED_RESOURCES</b>
       Added in version 3.6.

       This cache variable is used by the Eclipse project generator.  See <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generators.7.html">cmake-generators</a>(7)</u>.

       The Eclipse project generator generates so-called linked resources e.g. to the subproject  root  dirs  in
       the  source  tree  or  to  the source files of targets.  This can be disabled by setting this variable to
       FALSE.

   <b>CMAKE_ECLIPSE_GENERATE_SOURCE_PROJECT</b>
       Added in version 3.6.

       This cache variable is used by the Eclipse project generator.  See <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generators.7.html">cmake-generators</a>(7)</u>.

       If this variable is set to TRUE, the Eclipse project  generator  will  generate  an  Eclipse  project  in
       <u>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</u>  .  This project can then be used in Eclipse e.g. for the version control functionality.
       <b>CMAKE_ECLIPSE_GENERATE_SOURCE_PROJECT</b> defaults to <b>FALSE</b>; so nothing is written into the source directory.

   <b>CMAKE_ECLIPSE_MAKE_ARGUMENTS</b>
       Added in version 3.6.

       This cache variable is used by the Eclipse project generator.  See <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generators.7.html">cmake-generators</a>(7)</u>.

       This variable holds arguments which are used when Eclipse  invokes  the  make  tool.  By  default  it  is
       initialized to hold flags to enable parallel builds (using -j typically).

   <b>CMAKE_ECLIPSE_RESOURCE_ENCODING</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       This  cache  variable  tells the <u>Eclipse</u> <u>CDT4</u> project generator to set the resource encoding to the given
       value in generated project files.  If no value is given, no encoding will be set.

   <b>CMAKE_ECLIPSE_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.6.

       This cache variable is used by the Eclipse project generator.  See <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generators.7.html">cmake-generators</a>(7)</u>.

       When using the Eclipse project generator, CMake tries to find  the  Eclipse  executable  and  detect  the
       version of it. Depending on the version it finds, some features are enabled or disabled. If CMake doesn't
       find Eclipse, it assumes the oldest supported version, Eclipse Callisto (3.2).

   <b>CMAKE_ERROR_DEPRECATED</b>
       Whether to issue errors for deprecated functionality.

       If  <b>TRUE</b>,  use  of  deprecated functionality will issue fatal errors.  If this variable is not set, CMake
       behaves as if it were set to <b>FALSE</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION</b>
       Ask <b>cmake_install.cmake</b> script to error out as soon as  a  file  with  absolute  <b>INSTALL</b>  <b>DESTINATION</b>  is
       encountered.

       The  fatal  error is emitted before the installation of the offending file takes place.  This variable is
       used by CMake-generated <b>cmake_install.cmake</b> scripts.  If one sets this variable to <b>ON</b> while  running  the
       script, it may get fatal error messages from the script.

   <b>CMAKE_EXECUTE_PROCESS_COMMAND_ECHO</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       If  this  variable  is  set  to  <b>STDERR</b>,  <b>STDOUT</b> or <b>NONE</b> then commands in <u>execute_process()</u> calls will be
       printed to either stderr or stdout or not at all.

   <b>CMAKE_EXPORT_BUILD_DATABASE</b>
       Added in version 3.31.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This variable is meaningful only when experimental support for build databases has been enabled by the
          <b>CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_EXPORT_BUILD_DATABASE</b> gate.

       Enable/Disable output of module compile commands during the build.

       If enabled, generates a <b>build_database.json</b> file  containing  the  information  necessary  to  compile  a
       target's C++ module sources with any tooling. The format of the JSON file looks like:

          {
            "version": 1,
            "revision": 0,
            "sets": [
              {
                "family-name" : "export_build_database",
                "name" : "export_build_database@Debug",
                "translation-units" : [
                  {
                    "arguments": [
                      "/path/to/compiler",
                      "...",
                    ],
                    "baseline-arguments" :
                    [
                      "...",
                    ],
                    "local-arguments" :
                    [
                      "...",
                    ],
                    "object": "CMakeFiles/target.dir/source.cxx.o",
                    "private": true,
                    "provides": {
                      "importable": "path/to/bmi"
                    },
                    "requires" : [],
                    "source": "path/to/source.cxx",
                    "work-directory": "/path/to/working/directory"
                  }
                ],
                "visible-sets" : []
              }
            ]
          }

       This  is  initialized  by  the  <u>CMAKE_EXPORT_BUILD_DATABASE</u>  environment  variable,  and  initializes the
       <u>EXPORT_BUILD_DATABASE</u> target property for all targets.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This option is implemented only by the <u>Ninja</u> <u>Generators</u>.  It is ignored on other generators.

       When supported and enabled, numerous targets are created in order to make it possible  to  build  a  file
       containing just the commands that are needed for the tool in question.

       <b>cmake_build_database-&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
              Writes  <b>build_database_&lt;CONFIG&gt;.json</b>.  Writes  a build database for the entire build for the given
              configuration and all languages. Not available if the configuration name is the empty string.

       <b>cmake_build_database-&lt;LANG&gt;-&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
              Writes <b>build_database_&lt;LANG&gt;_&lt;CONFIG&gt;.json</b>. Writes build database for the  entire  build  for  the
              given configuration and language. Not available if the configuration name is the empty string.

       <b>cmake_build_database-&lt;LANG&gt;</b>
              Writes  <b>build_database_&lt;LANG&gt;.json</b>.  Writes  build  database  for  the  entire build for the given
              language and all configurations. In a multi-config generator, other build  configuration  database
              may be assumed to exist.

       <b>cmake_build_database</b>
              Writes  to  <b>build_database.json</b>.  Writes build database for all languages and configurations. In a
              multi-config generator, other build configuration database may be assumed to exist.

   <b>CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS</b>
       Added in version 3.5.

       Enable/Disable output of compile commands during generation.

       If enabled,  generates  a  <b>compile_commands.json</b>  file  containing  the  exact  compiler  calls  for  all
       translation units of the project in machine-readable form.  The format of the JSON file looks like:

          [
            {
              "directory": "/home/user/development/project",
              "command": "/usr/bin/c++ ... -c ../foo/foo.cc",
              "file": "../foo/foo.cc",
              "output": "../foo.dir/foo.cc.o"
            },

            ...

            {
              "directory": "/home/user/development/project",
              "command": "/usr/bin/c++ ... -c ../foo/bar.cc",
              "file": "../foo/bar.cc",
              "output": "../foo.dir/bar.cc.o"
            }
          ]

       This  is  initialized  by  the  <u>CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS</u>  environment  variable, and initializes the
       <u>EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS</u> target property for all targets.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This option is implemented only by <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u> and <u>Ninja</u> <u>Generators</u>.  It is ignored  on  other
          generators.

          This  option  currently  does not work well in combination with the <u>UNITY_BUILD</u> target property or the
          <u>CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       Enables the <u>export(PACKAGE)</u> command when <u>CMP0090</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>.

       The <u>export(PACKAGE)</u> command does nothing by default.  In some cases it is desirable to write to the  user
       package registry, so the <b>CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b> variable may be set to enable it.

       If  <u>CMP0090</u>  is  <u>not</u>  set  to  <b>NEW</b>  this  variable does nothing, and the <u>CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u>
       variable controls the behavior instead.

       See also <u>Disabling</u> <u>the</u> <u>Package</u> <u>Registry</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Disable the <u>export(PACKAGE)</u> command when <u>CMP0090</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b>.

       In some cases, for example for packaging and for system wide installations, it is not desirable to  write
       the   user   package   registry.   If  the  <b>CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b>  variable  is  enabled,  the
       <u>export(PACKAGE)</u> command will do nothing.

       If <u>CMP0090</u> is set to <b>NEW</b> this variable  does  nothing,  and  the  <u>CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u>  variable
       controls the behavior instead.

       See also <u>Disabling</u> <u>the</u> <u>Package</u> <u>Registry</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       This variable affects how <b>find_*</b> commands choose between macOS Application Bundles and unix-style package
       components.

       On  Darwin  or systems supporting macOS Application Bundles, the <b>CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE</b> variable can be set
       to empty or one of the following:

       <b>FIRST</b>  Try to find application bundles before standard programs.  This is the default on Darwin.

       <b>LAST</b>   Try to find application bundles after standard programs.

       <b>ONLY</b>   Only try to find application bundles.

       <b>NEVER</b>  Never try to find application bundles.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       This variable affects how  <b>find_*</b>  commands  choose  between  macOS  Frameworks  and  unix-style  package
       components.

       On  Darwin  or systems supporting macOS Frameworks, the <b>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b> variable can be set to empty
       or one of the following:

       <b>FIRST</b>  Try to find frameworks before standard libraries or headers.  This is the default on Darwin.

       <b>LAST</b>   Try to find frameworks after standard libraries or headers.

       <b>ONLY</b>   Only try to find frameworks.

       <b>NEVER</b>  Never try to find frameworks.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Specify a <b>&lt;suffix&gt;</b> to tell the <u>find_library()</u> command to search in a <b>lib&lt;suffix&gt;</b>  directory  before  each
       <b>lib</b> directory that would normally be searched.

       This overrides the behavior of related global properties:

       • <u>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS</u>

       • <u>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS</u>

       • <u>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS</u>

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES</b>
       Prefixes to prepend when looking for libraries.

       This specifies what prefixes to add to library names when the <u>find_library()</u> command looks for libraries.
       On  UNIX systems this is typically <b>lib</b>, meaning that when trying to find the <b>foo</b> library it will look for
       <b>libfoo</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES</b>
       Suffixes to append when looking for libraries.

       This specifies what suffixes to add to library names when the <u>find_library()</u> command looks for libraries.
       On Windows systems this is typically <b>.lib</b> and, depending on the  compiler,  <b>.dll.lib</b>,  <b>.dll.a</b>,  <b>.a</b>  (e.g.
       rustc, GCC, or Clang), so when it tries to find the <b>foo</b> library, it will look for <b>[&lt;prefix&gt;]foo[.dll].lib</b>
       and/or  <b>[&lt;prefix&gt;]foo[.dll].a</b>,  depending  on  the  compiler  used  and  the  <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>  specified  in the
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX</b>
       Exclude   the   values   of   the   <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>   and   <u>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</u>   variables    from
       <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH</u>.   CMake  adds these project-destination prefixes to <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH</u> by
       default in order to support building a series of dependent packages and installing  them  into  a  common
       prefix.  Set <b>CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX</b> to <b>TRUE</b> to suppress this behavior.

       The  <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH</u>  is  initialized  on  the  first  call  to a <u>project()</u> or <u>enable_language()</u>
       command.  Therefore one must set <b>CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX</b> before this in order  to  take  effect.   A
       user may set the variable as a cache entry on the command line to achieve this.

       Note  that  the  prefix(es) may still be searched for other reasons, such as being the same prefix as the
       CMake installation, or for being a built-in system prefix.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_PREFER_CONFIG</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       Tell <u>find_package()</u> to try "Config" mode before "Module" mode if no mode was specified.

       The command <u>find_package()</u> operates without an explicit mode when the reduced signature is  used  without
       the  <b>MODULE</b>  option.  In  this  case,  by  default,  CMake  first  tries  Module  mode by searching for a
       <b>Find&lt;pkg&gt;.cmake</b> module.  If it fails, CMake then searches for the package using Config mode.

       Set <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_PREFER_CONFIG</b> to <b>TRUE</b> to tell <u>find_package()</u> to first  search  using  Config  mode
       before falling back to Module mode.

       This variable may be useful when a developer has compiled a custom version of a common library and wishes
       to  link  it  to  a  dependent  project.   If  this variable is set to <b>TRUE</b>, it would prevent a dependent
       project's  call  to  <u>find_package()</u>  from  selecting  the  default  library  located  by   the   system's
       <b>Find&lt;pkg&gt;.cmake</b> module before finding the developer's custom built library.

       Once  this  variable  is set, it is the responsibility of the exported <b>&lt;pkg&gt;Config.cmake</b> files to provide
       the same result variables as the  <b>Find&lt;pkg&gt;.cmake</b>  modules  so  that  dependent  projects  can  use  them
       interchangeably.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_RESOLVE_SYMLINKS</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       Set to <b>TRUE</b> to tell <u>find_package()</u> calls to resolve symbolic links in the value of <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_DIR</b>.

       This  is helpful in use cases where the package search path points at a proxy directory in which symlinks
       to the real package locations appear.  This is not enabled by default because there are also  common  use
       cases in which the symlinks should be preserved.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_TARGETS_GLOBAL</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       Setting to <b>TRUE</b> promotes all <u>IMPORTED</u> targets discovered by <u>find_package()</u> to a <b>GLOBAL</b> scope.

       Setting  this  to  <b>TRUE</b>  is akin to specifying <b>GLOBAL</b> as an argument to <u>find_package()</u>.  Default value is
       <b>OFF</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE</b>
       Tell <u>find_package()</u> to warn if called without an explicit mode.

       If <u>find_package()</u> is called without an explicit  mode  option  (<b>MODULE</b>,  <b>CONFIG</b>,  or  <b>NO_MODULE</b>)  and  no
       <b>Find&lt;pkg&gt;.cmake</b>  module  is in <u>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</u> then CMake implicitly assumes that the caller intends to
       search for a package configuration file.  If no package configuration file is found then the  wording  of
       the  failure  message must account for both the case that the package is really missing and the case that
       the project has a bug and failed to provide the intended Find module.  If instead the caller specifies an
       explicit mode option then the failure message can be more specific.

       Set <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE</b> to <b>TRUE</b> to tell <u>find_package()</u> to warn when it  implicitly  assumes
       Config mode.  This helps developers enforce use of an explicit mode in all calls to <u>find_package()</u> within
       a project.

       This variable has no effect if <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_PREFER_CONFIG</u> is set to <b>TRUE</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</b>
       <u>Semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of root paths to search on the filesystem.

       This variable is most useful when cross-compiling. CMake uses the paths in this list as alternative roots
       to find filesystem items with <u>find_package()</u>, <u>find_library()</u> etc.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE</b>
       This  variable  controls  whether  the <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> and <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> are used by <u>find_file()</u> and
       <u>find_path()</u>.

       If set to <b>ONLY</b>, then only the roots in <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> will be searched. If set to <b>NEVER</b>,  then  the
       roots in <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> will be ignored and only the host system root will be used. If set to <b>BOTH</b>,
       then the host system paths and the paths in <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> will be searched.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY</b>
       This variable controls whether the <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> and <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> are used by <u>find_library()</u>.

       If  set  to <b>ONLY</b>, then only the roots in <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> will be searched. If set to <b>NEVER</b>, then the
       roots in <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> will be ignored and only the host system root will be used. If set to <b>BOTH</b>,
       then the host system paths and the paths in <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> will be searched.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE</b>
       This variable controls whether the <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> and <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> are used by <u>find_package()</u>.

       If set to <b>ONLY</b>, then only the roots in <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> will be searched. If set to <b>NEVER</b>,  then  the
       roots in <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> will be ignored and only the host system root will be used. If set to <b>BOTH</b>,
       then the host system paths and the paths in <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> will be searched.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM</b>
       This variable controls whether the <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> and <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> are used by <u>find_program()</u>.

       If  set  to <b>ONLY</b>, then only the roots in <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> will be searched. If set to <b>NEVER</b>, then the
       roots in <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> will be ignored and only the host system root will be used. If set to <b>BOTH</b>,
       then the host system paths and the paths in <u>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</u> will be searched.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Controls the default behavior of the following commands for whether or not to search  paths  provided  by
       cmake-specific environment variables:

       • <u>find_program()</u>

       • <u>find_library()</u>

       • <u>find_file()</u>

       • <u>find_path()</u>

       • <u>find_package()</u>

       This is useful in cross-compiling environments.

       By  default this variable is not set, which is equivalent to it having a value of <b>TRUE</b>.  Explicit options
       given to the above commands take precedence over this variable.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Controls the default behavior of the following commands for whether or not to search  paths  provided  by

       • <u>find_program()</u>

       • <u>find_library()</u>

       • <u>find_file()</u>

       • <u>find_path()</u>

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Controls the default behavior of the following commands for whether or not to search  paths  provided  by

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_USE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       Controls the default behavior of the following commands for whether or not to search the locations in the

       • <u>find_program()</u>

       • <u>find_library()</u>

       This is useful in cross-compiling environments.

       Due to backwards compatibility with <u>CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>, the behavior of the find command change
       based on if this variable exists.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Controls the default behavior of the <u>find_package()</u> command for whether or not to search  paths  provided
       by the <u>User</u> <u>Package</u> <u>Registry</u>.

       By  default this variable is not set and the behavior will fall back to that determined by the deprecated
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u> variable.  If that is also not set, then <u>find_package()</u>  will  use
       the <u>User</u> <u>Package</u> <u>Registry</u> unless the <b>NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b> option is provided.

       This variable takes precedence over <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u> when both are set.

       In  some cases, for example to locate only system wide installations, it is not desirable to use the <u>User</u>
       <u>Package</u> <u>Registry</u> when searching for packages.  If the <b>CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b> variable is  <b>FALSE</b>,

       • <u>find_path()</u>

       • <u>find_package()</u>

       This is useful in cross-compiling environments.

       By default this variable is not set, which is equivalent to it having a value of <b>TRUE</b>.  Explicit  options
       given to the above commands take precedence over this variable.

       See        also        the        <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH</u>,       <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</u>,
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>,     <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH</u>,     <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u>,
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH</u>, and <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u> variables.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Controls searching the <u>System</u> <u>Package</u> <u>Registry</u> by the <u>find_package()</u> command.

       By  default this variable is not set and the behavior will fall back to that determined by the deprecated
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u> variable.  If that is also  not  set,  then  <u>find_package()</u>
       will use the <u>System</u> <u>Package</u> <u>Registry</u> unless the <b>NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b> option is provided.

       This variable takes precedence over <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u> when both are set.

       In  some  cases,  for  example to locate only user specific installations, it is not desirable to use the
       <u>System</u> <u>Package</u> <u>Registry</u>  when  searching  for  packages.  If  the  <b>CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b>
       variable  is <b>FALSE</b>, all the <u>find_package()</u> commands will skip the <u>System</u> <u>Package</u> <u>Registry</u> as if they were
       called with the <b>NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b> argument.

       See also <u>Disabling</u> <u>the</u> <u>Package</u> <u>Registry</u>.

       See       also        the        <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH</u>,        <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</u>,
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>,  <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH</u>, <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</u>,
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u>, and <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH</u> variables.

   <b>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</b>
       <u>Semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of directories specifying a  search  path  for  macOS  frameworks  used  by  the
       <u>find_library()</u>, <u>find_package()</u>, <u>find_path()</u>, and <u>find_file()</u> commands.

       There is also an environment variable <u>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</u>, which is used as an additional list of search
       directories.

   <b>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH</b>
       <u>Semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of directories to be ignored by the various <b>find...()</b> commands.

       For  <u>find_program()</u>,  <u>find_library()</u>,  <u>find_file()</u>,  and <u>find_path()</u>, any file found in one of the listed
       directories will be ignored. The listed directories do not apply recursively, so any subdirectories to be
       ignored must also be explicitly listed.  <b>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH</b> does not affect the search  <u>prefixes</u>  used  by
       these  four  commands.  To  ignore individual paths under a search prefix (e.g. <b>bin</b>, <b>include</b>, <b>lib</b>, etc.),
       each path must be listed in <b>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH</b> as a full absolute path. <u>CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</u>  provides
       a more appropriate way to ignore a whole search prefix.

       <u>find_package()</u>   is  also  affected  by  <b>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH</b>,  but  only  for  <u>Config</u>  <u>mode</u>  searches.  Any
       <b>&lt;Name&gt;Config.cmake</b> or <b>&lt;name&gt;-config.cmake</b> file found in one of the specified directories will be ignored.
       In addition, any search <u>prefix</u> found in <b>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH</b> will  be  skipped  for  backward  compatibility
       reasons, but new code should prefer to use <u>CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</u> to ignore prefixes instead.

       Ignoring  search  locations  can  be useful in cross-compiling environments where some system directories
       contain  incompatible  but  possibly  linkable  libraries.   For  example,  on   cross-compiled   cluster
       environments,  this  allows  a  user  to  ignore directories containing libraries meant for the front-end
       machine.

       By default, <b>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH</b> is empty. It is intended to be set by the project or the end user.

       See also the following variables:

       • <u>CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH</u>

   <b>CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</b>
       Added in version 3.23.

       <u>Semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of  search  <u>prefixes</u>  to  be  ignored  by  the  <u>find_program()</u>,  <u>find_library()</u>,
       <u>find_file()</u>,  and  <u>find_path()</u>  commands.   The  prefixes  are  also  ignored  by  the <u>Config</u> <u>mode</u> of the
       <u>find_package()</u> command (<u>Module</u>  <u>mode</u>  is  unaffected).   To  ignore  specific  directories  instead,  see
       <u>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH</u>.

       Ignoring  search  locations  can  be useful in cross-compiling environments where some system directories
       contain  incompatible  but  possibly  linkable  libraries.   For  example,  on   cross-compiled   cluster
       environments,  this  allows  a  user  to  ignore directories containing libraries meant for the front-end
       machine.

       By default, <b>CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</b> is empty. It is intended to be set by the project or the end user.

       See also the following variables:

       • <u>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH</u>

   <b>CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE</b>
       Whether to append or prepend directories by default in <u>include_directories()</u>.

       This variable affects the default behavior of the <u>include_directories()</u> command.  Setting  this  variable
       to <b>ON</b> is equivalent to using the <b>BEFORE</b> option in all uses of that command.

   <b>CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_PROJECT_BEFORE</b>
       Whether to force prepending of project include directories.

       This  variable  affects  the order of include directories generated in compiler command lines.  If set to
       <b>ON</b>, it causes the <u>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</u> and the <u>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</u> to appear first.

   <b>CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH</b>
       <u>Semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of directories specifying a search path  for  the  <u>find_file()</u>  and  <u>find_path()</u>
       commands.  By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project.

       There  is  also an environment variable <u>CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH</u>, which is used as an additional list of search
       directories.

       See also <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH</u> and <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME</b>
       Default component used in <u>install()</u> commands.

       If an <u>install()</u> command is used without the <b>COMPONENT</b> argument,  these  files  will  be  grouped  into  a
       default  component.   The  name  of  this default install component will be taken from this variable.  It
       defaults to <b>Unspecified</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       Default permissions for directories created implicitly during installation  of  files  by  <u>install()</u>  and
       <u>file(INSTALL)</u>.

       If  <b>make</b>  <b>install</b>  is  invoked  and  directories  are  implicitly  created  they  get  permissions set by
       <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS</b> variable or platform  specific  default  permissions  if  the
       variable is not set.

       Implicitly  created directories are created if they are not explicitly installed by <u>install()</u> command but
       are needed to install a file on a certain path. Example of such locations are directories created due  to
       the setting of <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>.

       Expected  content  of  the  <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS</b> variable is a list of permissions
       that can be used by <u>install()</u> command <u>PERMISSIONS</u> section.

       Example usage:

          set(CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS
               OWNER_READ
               OWNER_WRITE
               OWNER_EXECUTE
               GROUP_READ
             )

   <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Specify verbosity of installation script code generated by the <u>install()</u> command (using the <u>file(INSTALL)</u>
       command).  For paths that are newly installed or updated, installation may print lines like:

          -- Installing: /some/destination/path

       For paths that are already up to date, installation may print lines like:

          -- Up-to-date: /some/destination/path

       The <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE</b> variable may be set to control which messages are printed:

       <b>ALWAYS</b> Print both <b>Installing</b> and <b>Up-to-date</b> messages.

       <b>LAZY</b>   Print <b>Installing</b> but not <b>Up-to-date</b> messages.

       <b>NEVER</b>  Print neither <b>Installing</b> nor <b>Up-to-date</b> messages.

       Other values have undefined behavior and may not be diagnosed.

       If this variable is not set, the default behavior is <b>ALWAYS</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b>
       Install directory used by <u>install()</u>.

       If <b>make</b> <b>install</b> is invoked or <b>INSTALL</b> is built, this directory is prepended onto all install directories.

       This variable defaults as follows:

       • Added in version 3.29: If the <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> environment variable is set, its value  is  used  as
         default for this variable.

       • <b>c:/Program</b> <b>Files/${PROJECT_NAME}</b> on Windows.

       • <b><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></b> on UNIX platforms.

       See <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX_INITIALIZED_TO_DEFAULT</u> for how a project might choose its own default.

       On  UNIX one can use the <b>DESTDIR</b> mechanism in order to relocate the whole installation to a staging area.
       See the <u>DESTDIR</u> environment variable for more information.

       The installation prefix is also added to <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH</u> so that <u>find_package()</u>, <u>find_program()</u>,
       <u>find_library()</u>, <u>find_path()</u>, and <u>find_file()</u> will search the prefix for other software. This behavior can
       be disabled by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> to <b>TRUE</b> before the first <u>project()</u> invocation.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Use the <u>GNUInstallDirs</u> module to provide GNU-style options for the layout of  directories  within  the
          installation.

       The  <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b>  may  be  defined when configuring a build tree to set its installation prefix.
       Or, when using the <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u> command-line tool's <u>--install</u> mode, one may specify a different prefix  using
       the <u>--prefix</u> option:

          cmake --install . --prefix /my/install/prefix

   <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX_INITIALIZED_TO_DEFAULT</b>
       Added in version 3.7.1.

       CMake  sets  this variable to a <b>TRUE</b> value when the <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> has just been initialized to its
       default value, typically on the first run of CMake within a new build tree and  the  <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>
       environment variable is not set on the first run of CMake. This can be used by project code to change the
       default without overriding a user-provided value:

          if(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX_INITIALIZED_TO_DEFAULT)
            set_property(CACHE CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX PROPERTY VALUE "/my/default")
          endif()

   <b>CMAKE_KATE_FILES_MODE</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       This  cache  variable  is used by the Kate project generator and controls to what mode the <b>files</b> entry in
       the project file will be set.  See <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generators.7.html">cmake-generators</a>(7)</u>.

       Possible values are <b>AUTO</b>, <b>SVN</b>, <b>GIT</b>, <b>HG</b>, <b>FOSSIL</b> and <b>LIST</b>.

       When set to <b>LIST</b>, CMake will put the list of source files known to CMake in the project file.   When  set
       to <b>SVN</b>, <b>GIT</b>, <b>HG</b> or <b>FOSSIL</b>, CMake will set the generated project accordingly to Subversion, git, Mercurial
       or  Fossil,  and Kate will then use the respective command line tool to retrieve the list of files in the
       project.  When unset or set to <b>AUTO</b>, CMake will try to detect whether the source directory is part  of  a
       git or svn checkout or not, and put the respective entry into the project file.

   <b>CMAKE_KATE_MAKE_ARGUMENTS</b>
       Added in version 3.0.

       This cache variable is used by the Kate project generator.  See <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generators.7.html">cmake-generators</a>(7)</u>.

       This  variable  holds  arguments  which  are  used  when  Kate  invokes  the  make tool. By default it is
       initialized to hold flags to enable parallel builds (using -j typically).

   <b>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH</b>
       <u>Semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of directories specifying a search path  for  the  <u>find_library()</u>  command.   By
       default it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project.

       There  is  also an environment variable <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH</u>, which is used as an additional list of search
       directories.

       See also <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH</u> and <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       Whether to append or prepend directories by default in <u>link_directories()</u>.

       This variable affects the default behavior of the <u>link_directories()</u> command.  Setting this  variable  to
       <b>ON</b> is equivalent to using the <b>BEFORE</b> option in all uses of that command.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARIES_ONLY_TARGETS</b>
       Added in version 3.23.

       Set  this  variable  to  initialize the <u>LINK_LIBRARIES_ONLY_TARGETS</u> property of non-imported targets when
       they  are  created.   Setting  it  to  true  enables  an  additional  check  that  all  items  named   by
       <u>target_link_libraries()</u>  that can be target names are actually names of existing targets.  See the target
       property documentation for details.

   <b>CMAKE_MAXIMUM_RECURSION_DEPTH</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       Maximum recursion depth for  CMake  scripts.  It  is  intended  to  be  set  on  the  command  line  with
       <b>-DCMAKE_MAXIMUM_RECURSION_DEPTH=&lt;x&gt;</b>,  or within <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> by projects that require a large recursion
       depth. Projects that set this variable should provide the user with a way to override it. For example:

          # About to perform deeply recursive actions
          if(NOT CMAKE_MAXIMUM_RECURSION_DEPTH)
            set(CMAKE_MAXIMUM_RECURSION_DEPTH 2000)
          endif()

       If it is not set, or is set to a non-integer value, a sensible default limit is used.  If  the  recursion
       limit is reached, the script terminates immediately with a fatal error.

       Calling any of the following commands increases the recursion depth:

       • <u>include()</u>

       • <u>find_package()</u>

       • <u>add_subdirectory()</u>

       • <u>try_compile()</u>

       • <u>ctest_read_custom_files()</u>

       • <u>ctest_run_script()</u> (unless <b>NEW_PROCESS</b> is specified)

       • User-defined  <u>function()</u>'s  and  <u>macro()</u>'s  (note that <u>function()</u> and <u>macro()</u> themselves don't increase
         recursion depth)

       • Reading or writing variables that are being watched by a <u>variable_watch()</u>

       See also the <u>CMAKE_MAXIMUM_RECURSION_DEPTH</u> environment variable.

   <b>CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       When enabled by the <u>cmake</u> <u>--log-context</u> command line option or the  <u>CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW</u>  variable,
       the  <u>message()</u>  command converts the <b>CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT</b> list into a dot-separated string surrounded by
       square brackets and prepends it to each line for messages of log levels <b>NOTICE</b> and below.

       For logging contexts to work effectively, projects should generally <b>APPEND</b> and <b>POP_BACK</b> an  item  to  the
       current  value  of  <b>CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT</b> rather than replace it.  Projects should not assume the message
       context at the top of the source tree is empty, as there are  scenarios  where  the  context  might  have
       already been set (e.g. hierarchical projects).

       <b>WARNING:</b>
          Valid context names are restricted to anything that could be used as a CMake variable name.  All names
          that  begin  with an underscore or the string <b>cmake_</b> are also reserved for use by CMake and should not
          be used by projects.

       Example:

          function(bar)
            list(APPEND CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT "bar")
            message(VERBOSE "bar VERBOSE message")
          endfunction()

          function(baz)
            list(APPEND CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT "baz")
            message(DEBUG "baz DEBUG message")
          endfunction()

          function(foo)
            list(APPEND CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT "foo")
            bar()
            message(TRACE "foo TRACE message")
            baz()
          endfunction()

          list(APPEND CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT "top")

          message(VERBOSE "Before `foo`")
          foo()
          message(VERBOSE "After `foo`")

          list(POP_BACK CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT)

       Which results in the following output:

          -- [top] Before `foo`
          -- [top.foo.bar] bar VERBOSE message
          -- [top.foo] foo TRACE message
          -- [top.foo.baz] baz DEBUG message
          -- [top] After `foo`

   <b>CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       Setting this variable to true enables showing a context with each line logged by  the  <u>message()</u>  command
       (see <u>CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT</u> for how the context itself is specified).

       This variable is an alternative to providing the <b>--log-context</b> option on the <u>cmake</u> command line.  Whereas
       the command line option will apply only to that one CMake run, setting <b>CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW</b> to true
       as a cache variable will ensure that subsequent CMake runs will continue to show the message context.

       Projects  should  not  set <b>CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW</b>.  It is intended for users so that they may control
       whether or not to include context with messages.

   <b>CMAKE_MESSAGE_INDENT</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       The <u>message()</u> command joins the strings from this list and  for  log  levels  of  <b>NOTICE</b>  and  below,  it
       prepends the resultant string to each line of the message.

       Example:

          list(APPEND listVar one two three)

          message(VERBOSE [[Collected items in the "listVar":]])
          list(APPEND CMAKE_MESSAGE_INDENT "  ")

          foreach(item IN LISTS listVar)
            message(VERBOSE ${item})
          endforeach()

          list(POP_BACK CMAKE_MESSAGE_INDENT)
          message(VERBOSE "No more indent")

       Which results in the following output:

          -- Collected items in the "listVar":
          --   one
          --   two
          --   three
          -- No more indent

   <b>CMAKE_MESSAGE_LOG_LEVEL</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       When  set, this variable specifies the logging level used by the <u>message()</u> command.  Valid values are the
       same as those for the <u>--log-level</u> command line option of the <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u> program.  If this variable  is  set
       and the <u>--log-level</u> command line option is given, the command line option takes precedence.

       The  main advantage to using this variable is to make a log level persist between CMake runs.  Setting it
       as a cache variable will ensure that subsequent CMake runs will continue to use the chosen log level.

       Projects should not set this variable, it is intended for users so that they may control  the  log  level
       according to their own needs.

       Added  in  version  3.25:  See the <u>cmake_language()</u> <u>cmake_language</u> command for a way to query the current
       message logging level.

   <b>CMAKE_MFC_FLAG</b>
       Use the MFC library for an executable or dll.

       Enables the use of the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC).  It should be set to  <b>1</b>  for  the  static  MFC
       library, and <b>2</b> for the shared MFC library.  This is used in Visual Studio project files.

       Usage example:

          add_definitions(-D_AFXDLL)
          set(CMAKE_MFC_FLAG 2)
          add_executable(CMakeSetup WIN32 ${SRCS})

       Contents of <b>CMAKE_MFC_FLAG</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</b>
       <u>Semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u> of directories, represented using forward slashes, specifying a search path for
       CMake modules to be loaded by the <u>include()</u>  or  <u>find_package()</u>  commands  before  checking  the  default
       modules that come with CMake. By default it is empty. It is intended to be set by the project.

       It's  fairly  common  for  a  project  to  have a directory containing various <b>*.cmake</b> files to assist in
       development. Adding the directory to the  <u>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</u>  simplifies  loading  them.  For  example,  a
       project's top-level <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file may contain:

          list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake")

          include(Foo) # Loads ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/Foo.cmake

          find_package(Bar) # Loads ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/FindBar.cmake

   <b>CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;</b>
       Default for CMake Policy <b>CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;</b> when it is otherwise left unset.

       Commands  <u>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)</u>  and <u>cmake_policy(VERSION)</u> by default leave policies introduced
       after the given version unset.  Set <b>CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;</b> to <b>OLD</b> or <b>NEW</b> to specify  the  default
       for policy <b>CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;</b>, where <b>&lt;NNNN&gt;</b> is the policy number.

       This  variable  should  not  be  set  by  a  project  in CMake code as a way to set its own policies; use
       <u>cmake_policy(SET)</u> instead.  This variable is meant to externally set policies for which a project has not
       itself been updated:

       • Users     running     CMake     may     set     this     variable     in      the      cache      (e.g.
         <b>-DCMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;=&lt;OLD|NEW&gt;</b>).   Set  it to <b>OLD</b> to quiet a policy warning while using old
         behavior or to <b>NEW</b> to try building the project with new behavior.

       • Projects may set this variable before a call to <u>add_subdirectory()</u> that adds a third-party  project  in
         order to set its policies without modifying third-party code.

   <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;</b>
       Explicitly  enable  or  disable  the  warning  when CMake Policy <b>CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;</b> has not been set explicitly by
       <u>cmake_policy()</u> or implicitly by <u>cmake_minimum_required()</u>. This is meaningful only for the  policies  that
       do not warn by default:

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0025</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0025</u>.

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0047</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0047</u>.

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0056</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0056</u>.

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0060</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0060</u>.

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0065</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0065</u>.

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0066</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0066</u>.

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0067</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0067</u>.

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0082</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0082</u>.

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0089</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0089</u>.

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0102</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0102</u>.

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0112</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0112</u>.

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0116</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0116</u>.

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0126</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0126</u>.

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0128</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0128</u>.

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0129</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0129</u>.

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0133</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0133</u>.

       • <b>CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0172</b> controls the warning for policy <u>CMP0172</u>.

       This  variable  should  not  be set by a project in CMake code.  Project developers running CMake may set
       this  variable  in  their  cache  to  enable  the  warning  (e.g.   <b>-DCMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;=ON</b>).
       Alternatively,  running  <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u>  with  the  <u>--debug-output</u>, <u>--trace</u>, or <u>--trace-expand</u> option will also
       enable the warning.

   <b>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</b>
       <u>Semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  of  directories  specifying  installation  <u>prefixes</u>  to  be  searched  by  the
       <u>find_package()</u>, <u>find_program()</u>, <u>find_library()</u>, <u>find_file()</u>, and <u>find_path()</u> commands.  Each command will
       add appropriate subdirectories (like <b>bin</b>, <b>lib</b>, or <b>include</b>) as specified in its own documentation.

       By default this is empty.  It is intended to be set by the project.

       There  is  also  an environment variable <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>, which is used as an additional list of search
       prefixes.

       See  also  <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH</u>,  <u>CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH</u>,  <u>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH</u>,  <u>CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH</u>,   and

   <b>CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH</b>
       <u>Semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  of  directories  specifying  a search path for the <u>find_program()</u> command.  By

       directories.

       See also <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH</u> and <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       A  CMake  language  file  to  be  included  as the first step of any <u>project()</u> command calls that specify

       and <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES</u> variables.

   <b>CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       <u>Semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  of  CMake  language files to include as part of the very first <u>project()</u> call.
       The files will be included immediately after the toolchain file has been read (if one is  specified)  and
       platform   variables   have   been   set,   but  before  any  languages  have  been  enabled.  Therefore,
       language-specific variables, including things like <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER</u>, might not  be  set.   See  <u>Code</u>
       <u>Injection</u> for a more detailed discussion of files potentially included during a <u>project()</u> call.

       Added  in version 3.29: This variable can also now refer to module names to be found in <u>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</u>
       or builtin to CMake.

       This variable is intended for specifying files that perform one-time setup for the build. It provides  an
       injection  point  for  things  like  configuring  package  managers, adding logic the user shares between
       projects (e.g. defining their own custom build types), and so on. It is primarily for users to add things
       specific to their environment, but not for specifying the toolchain details (use <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u> for
       that).

       By default, this variable is empty.  It is intended to be set by the user.

       See also:

       • <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_INCLUDE</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_INCLUDE_BEFORE</u>

       • <u>PROPAGATE_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES_TO_TRY_COMPILE</u>

   <b>CMAKE_REQUIRE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.22.

       Variable for making <u>find_package()</u> call <b>REQUIRED</b>.

       Every non-<b>REQUIRED</b> <u>find_package()</u> call in a project can be turned into <b>REQUIRED</b> by setting  the  variable
       <b>CMAKE_REQUIRE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt;</b>  to  <b>TRUE</b>.   This  can be used to assert assumptions about build
       environment and to ensure the build will fail early if they do not hold.

       Note that setting this  variable  to  true  breaks  some  commonly  used  patterns.   Multiple  calls  to
       <u>find_package()</u>  are  sometimes  used  to  obtain  a  different search order to the default.  For example,
       projects can force checking a known path for a particular package first before searching any of the other
       default search paths:

          find_package(something PATHS /some/local/path NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
          find_package(something)

       In  the  above,  the  first  call  looks  for  the  <b>something</b>  package  in  a  specific  directory.    If
       <b>CMAKE_REQUIRE_FIND_PACKAGE_something</b> is set to true, then this first call must succeed, otherwise a fatal
       error  occurs.   The  second  call never gets a chance to provide a fall-back to using the default search
       locations.

       A similar pattern is used even by some of CMake's own Find modules to search for a config package first:

          find_package(something CONFIG QUIET)
          if(NOT something_FOUND)
            # Fall back to searching using typical Find module logic...
          endif()

       Again, if <b>CMAKE_REQUIRE_FIND_PACKAGE_something</b> is true, the first  call  must  succeed.   It  effectively
       means a config package must be found for the dependency, and the Find module logic is never used.

       See also the <u>CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt;</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY</b>
       Don't make the <b>install</b> target depend on the <b>all</b> target.

       By default, the <b>install</b> target depends on the <b>all</b> target.  This has the effect, that when <b>make</b> <b>install</b> is
       invoked  or  <b>INSTALL</b>  is  built,  first  the  <b>all</b>  target  is  built,  then  the installation starts.  If
       <b>CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY</b> is set to <b>TRUE</b>, this dependency is not  created,  so  the  installation
       process will start immediately, independent from whether the project has been completely built or not.

       See also <u>CMAKE_SKIP_TEST_ALL_DEPENDENCY</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_SKIP_TEST_ALL_DEPENDENCY</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       Control whether the <b>test</b> target depends on the <b>all</b> target.

       If  this  variable is not defined, or is set to <b>TRUE</b>, then the <b>test</b> (or <b>RUN_TESTS</b>) target does not depend
       on the <b>all</b> (or <b>ALL_BUILD</b>) target.  When the <b>test</b> target is built, e.g., via <b>make</b> <b>test</b>, the  test  process
       will start immediately, regardless of whether the project has been completely built or not.

       If <b>CMAKE_SKIP_TEST_ALL_DEPENDENCY</b> is explicitly set to <b>FALSE</b>, then the <b>test</b> target will depend on the <b>all</b>
       target.  When the <b>test</b> target is built, e.g., via <b>make</b> <b>test</b>, the <b>all</b> target will be built first, and then
       the tests will run.

       See also <u>CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</b>
       This  variable may be set to a path to install to when cross-compiling. This can be useful if the path in
       <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> is read-only, or otherwise should remain pristine.

       The <b>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</b> location is also used as a search prefix by the <b>find_*</b>  commands.  This  can  be
       controlled by setting the <u>CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> variable.

       If  any  <b>RPATH</b>/<b>RUNPATH</b>  entries  passed to the linker contain the <b>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</b>, the matching path
       fragments are replaced with the <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_SUBLIME_TEXT_2_ENV_SETTINGS</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       This variable contains a list of env vars as a list of tokens with the syntax <b>var=value</b>.

       Example:

          set(CMAKE_SUBLIME_TEXT_2_ENV_SETTINGS
             "FOO=FOO1\;FOO2\;FOON"
             "BAR=BAR1\;BAR2\;BARN"
             "BAZ=BAZ1\;BAZ2\;BAZN"
             "FOOBAR=FOOBAR1\;FOOBAR2\;FOOBARN"
             "VALID="
             )

       In case of malformed variables CMake will fail:

          set(CMAKE_SUBLIME_TEXT_2_ENV_SETTINGS
              "THIS_IS_NOT_VALID"
              )

   <b>CMAKE_SUBLIME_TEXT_2_EXCLUDE_BUILD_TREE</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       If this variable evaluates to <b>ON</b> at the end of the top-level <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>  file,  the  <u>Sublime</u>  <u>Text</u>  <u>2</u>
       extra generator excludes the build tree from the <b>.sublime-project</b> if it is inside the source tree.

   <b>CMAKE_SUPPRESS_REGENERATION</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       If  <b>CMAKE_SUPPRESS_REGENERATION</b>  is  <b>OFF</b>, which is default, then CMake adds a special target on which all
       other targets depend that checks the build system and optionally re-runs CMake to  regenerate  the  build
       system when the target specification source changes.

       If  this variable evaluates to <b>ON</b> at the end of the top-level <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file, CMake will not add the
       regeneration target to the build system or perform any build system checks.

   <b>CMAKE_SYSROOT</b>
       Path to pass to the compiler in the <b>--sysroot</b> flag.

       The <b>CMAKE_SYSROOT</b> content is passed to the compiler in the <b>--sysroot</b> flag, if  supported.   The  path  is
       also  stripped  from  the  <b>RPATH</b>/<b>RUNPATH</b> if necessary on installation.  The <b>CMAKE_SYSROOT</b> is also used to
       prefix paths searched by the <b>find_*</b> commands.

       This variable may only be set in a toolchain file specified by the <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u> variable.

       See also the <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT_COMPILE</u> and <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT_LINK</u> variables.

   <b>CMAKE_SYSROOT_COMPILE</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Path to pass to the compiler in the <b>--sysroot</b> flag when compiling source files.   This  is  the  same  as
       <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> but is used only for compiling sources and not linking.

       This variable may only be set in a toolchain file specified by the <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_SYSROOT_LINK</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Path  to  pass to the compiler in the <b>--sysroot</b> flag when linking.  This is the same as <u>CMAKE_SYSROOT</u> but
       is used only for linking and not compiling sources.

       This variable may only be set in a toolchain file specified by the <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Search path for macOS application bundles used by the <u>find_program()</u>, and  <u>find_package()</u>  commands.   By
       default  it  contains the standard directories for the current system.  It is <u>not</u> intended to be modified
       by the project, use <u>CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</u> for this.

   <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Search path for macOS frameworks used by the <u>find_library()</u>, <u>find_package()</u>, <u>find_path()</u>, and <u>find_file()</u>
       commands.  By default it contains the standard directories for the current system.  It is <u>not</u> intended to
       be modified by the project, use <u>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</u> for this.

   <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH</b>
       <u>Semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of directories to be ignored by the various <b>find...()</b> commands.

       For <u>find_program()</u>, <u>find_library()</u>, <u>find_file()</u>, and <u>find_path()</u>, any file found in  one  of  the  listed
       directories will be ignored. The listed directories do not apply recursively, so any subdirectories to be
       ignored  must  also  be  explicitly listed.  <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH</b> does not affect the search <u>prefixes</u>
       used by these four commands. To ignore individual paths under a search prefix (e.g.  <b>bin</b>,  <b>include</b>,  <b>lib</b>,
       etc.),   each   path   must   be   listed   in   <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH</b>   as   a  full  absolute  path.
       <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</u> provides a more appropriate way to ignore a whole search prefix.

       <u>find_package()</u> is also affected by <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH</b>, but  only  for  <u>Config</u>  <u>mode</u>  searches.  Any
       <b>&lt;Name&gt;Config.cmake</b> or <b>&lt;name&gt;-config.cmake</b> file found in one of the specified directories will be ignored.
       In  addition,  any  search  <u>prefix</u>  found  in  <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH</b>  will  be  skipped  for  backward
       compatibility reasons, but new code  should  prefer  to  use  <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</u>  to  ignore
       prefixes instead.

       Ignoring  search  locations  can  be useful in cross-compiling environments where some system directories
       contain  incompatible  but  possibly  linkable  libraries.   For  example,  on   cross-compiled   cluster
       environments,  this  allows  a  user  to  ignore directories containing libraries meant for the front-end
       machine.

       <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH</b> is populated by CMake as part of its platform and toolchain setup.  Its  purpose
       is  to  ignore  locations  containing  incompatible  binaries  meant  for the host rather than the target
       platform.  The project or end user should not modify this variable,  they  should  use  <u>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH</u>
       instead.

       • <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH</u>

   <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</b>
       Added in version 3.23.

       <u>Semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  of  search  <u>prefixes</u>  to  be  ignored  by  the <u>find_program()</u>, <u>find_library()</u>,
       <u>find_file()</u>, and <u>find_path()</u> commands.  The  prefixes  are  also  ignored  by  the  <u>Config</u>  <u>mode</u>  of  the
       <u>find_package()</u>  command  (<u>Module</u>  <u>mode</u>  is  unaffected).   To  ignore  specific  directories instead, see
       <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH</u>.

       Ignoring search locations can be useful in cross-compiling environments  where  some  system  directories
       contain   incompatible   but  possibly  linkable  libraries.   For  example,  on  cross-compiled  cluster
       environments, this allows a user to ignore directories  containing  libraries  meant  for  the  front-end
       machine.

       <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH</b>  is  populated  by CMake as part of its platform and toolchain setup. Its
       purpose is to ignore locations containing incompatible binaries meant for the host rather than the target
       platform.   The  project  or  end   user   should   not   modify   this   variable,   they   should   use

       <u>Semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  of  directories  specifying  installation  <u>prefixes</u>  to  be  searched  by  the
       <u>find_package()</u>, <u>find_program()</u>, <u>find_library()</u>, <u>find_file()</u>, and <u>find_path()</u> commands.  Each command will
       add appropriate subdirectories (like <b>bin</b>, <b>lib</b>, or <b>include</b>) as specified in its own documentation.

       By default this contains the system directories for the current system, the <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>, and the
       <u>CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX</u>.    The   installation   and  staging  prefixes  may  be  excluded  by  setting  the
       <u>CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> variable before the first <u>project()</u> invocation.

       The system directories that are  contained  in  <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH</b>  are  locations  that  typically
       include installed software. An example being <b><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></b> for UNIX based platforms. In addition to standard
       platform  locations,  CMake  will  also  add  values  to  <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH</b>  based  on environment
       variables. The environment variables and search locations that  CMake  uses  may  evolve  over  time,  as
       platforms  and  their  conventions  also evolve. The following provides an indicative list of environment
       variables and locations that CMake searches, but they are subject to change:

       <b>CrayLinuxEnvironment:</b>

              • <b>ENV{SYSROOT_DIR}/</b>

              • <b>ENV{SYSROOT_DIR}<a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b>

              • <b>ENV{SYSROOT_DIR}<a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></b>

       <b>Darwin:</b>

              • <b>ENV{SDKROOT}<a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b> When <b>CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT</b> is not explicitly specified.

       <b>OpenBSD:</b>

              • <b>ENV{LOCALBASE}</b>

       <b>Unix:</b>

              • <b>ENV{CONDA_PREFIX}</b> when using a conda compiler

       <b>MSYSTEM</b> <b>environment</b> <b>with</b> <b>MinGW</b> <b>toolchain:</b>
              Added in version 3.28.

              • <b>ENV{MSYSTEM_PREFIX}/local</b>

              • <b>ENV{MSYSTEM_PREFIX}</b>

       <b>Windows:</b>

              • <b>ENV{ProgramW6432}</b>

              • <b>ENV{ProgramFiles}</b>

              • <b>ENV{ProgramFiles(x86)}</b>

              • <b>ENV{SystemDrive}/Program</b> <b>Files</b>

              • <b>ENV{SystemDrive}/Program</b> <b>Files</b> <b>(x86)</b>

       <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH</b> is <u>not</u> intended to be modified by the project; use <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u> for this.

       See   also   <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH</u>,   <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH</u>,    <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH</u>,    and
       <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH</b>
       <u>Semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  of  directories  specifying  a search path for the <u>find_program()</u> command.  By
       default this contains the standard directories for the current system.  It is <u>not</u> intended to be modified
       by the project; use <u>CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH</u> for this.  See also <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO</b>
       Specify the default value for the <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u> and <u>file(UPLOAD)</u> commands' <b>TLS_CAINFO</b>  options.   It  is
       unset by default.

       This  variable  is  also  used  by  the  <u>ExternalProject</u>  and  <u>FetchContent</u> modules for internal calls to
       <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY</b>
       Specify the default value for the <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u> and <u>file(UPLOAD)</u> commands' <b>TLS_VERIFY</b> options.  If  this
       variable  is  not  set, the commands check the <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY</u> environment variable.  If neither is set,
       the default is <u>on</u>.

       Changed in version 3.31: The default is on.   Previously,  the  default  was  off.   Users  may  set  the
       <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY</u> environment variable to <b>0</b> to restore the old default.

       This  variable  is  also  used  by  the  <u>ExternalProject</u>  and  <u>FetchContent</u> modules for internal calls to
       <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u>.

       TLS verification can help provide confidence  that  one  is  connecting  to  the  desired  server.   When
       downloading known content, one should also use file hashes to verify it.

          set(CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY TRUE)

   <b>CMAKE_TLS_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.30.

       Specify  the default value for the <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u> and <u>file(UPLOAD)</u> commands' <b>TLS_VERSION</b> option.  If this
       variable is not set, the commands check the <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERSION</u> environment variable.  If neither  is  set,
       the default is TLS 1.2.

       Changed in version 3.31: The default is TLS 1.2.  Previously, no minimum version was enforced by default.

       The value may be one of:

       • <b>1.0</b>

       • <b>1.1</b>

       • <b>1.2</b>

       • <b>1.3</b>

       This  variable  is  also  used  by  the  <u>ExternalProject</u>  and  <u>FetchContent</u> modules for internal calls to
       <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u> and <b>git</b> <b>clone</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE</b>
       Specify a CMake file that overrides platform information.

       CMake loads the specified file while enabling support for each language  from  either  the  <u>project()</u>  or
       <u>enable_language()</u> commands.  It is loaded after CMake's builtin compiler and platform information modules
       have  been loaded but before the information is used.  The file may set platform information variables to
       override CMake's defaults.  See <u>CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_&lt;LANG&gt;</u> for the  language-specific  version
       of this variable.

       This  feature  is intended for use only in overriding information variables that must be set before CMake
       builds its first test project to check that the compiler for a language works.  It should not be used  to
       load  a  file in cases that a normal <u>include()</u> will work.  Use it only as a last resort for behavior that
       cannot be achieved any other way.  For example, one may set the <u>CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT</u> variable to change the
       default value used to initialize the <u>CMAKE_C_FLAGS</u> variable before  it  is  cached.   The  override  file
       should  NOT be used to set anything that could be set after languages are enabled, such as variables like
       <u>CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u> that affect the placement of binaries.  Information set in the  file  will
       be used for <u>try_compile()</u> and <u>try_run()</u> builds too.

   <b>CMAKE_WARN_DEPRECATED</b>
       Whether to issue warnings for deprecated functionality.

       If  not  <b>FALSE</b>,  use of deprecated functionality will issue warnings.  If this variable is not set, CMake
       behaves as if it were set to <b>TRUE</b>.

       When running <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u>, this option can be enabled with the <u>-Wdeprecated</u>  option,  or  disabled  with  the
       <u>-Wno-deprecated</u> option.

   <b>CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION</b>
       Ask <b>cmake_install.cmake</b> script to warn each time a file with absolute <b>INSTALL</b> <b>DESTINATION</b> is encountered.

       This  variable  is  used by CMake-generated <b>cmake_install.cmake</b> scripts.  If one sets this variable to <b>ON</b>
       while running the script, it may get warning messages from the script.

   <b>CMAKE_XCODE_GENERATE_SCHEME</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       If enabled, the <u>Xcode</u> generator will generate schema files.  These are useful to invoke analyze, archive,
       build-for-testing and test actions from the command line.

       This variable initializes the <u>XCODE_GENERATE_SCHEME</u> target property on all targets.

   <b>CMAKE_XCODE_GENERATE_TOP_LEVEL_PROJECT_ONLY</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       If enabled, the <u>Xcode</u> generator will generate only a single Xcode project file for the topmost  <u>project()</u>
       command instead of generating one for every <b>project()</b> command.

       This could be useful to speed up the CMake generation step for large projects and to work-around a bug in
       the <b>ZERO_CHECK</b> logic.

   <b>CMAKE_XCODE_LINK_BUILD_PHASE_MODE</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       This  variable is used to initialize the <u>XCODE_LINK_BUILD_PHASE_MODE</u> property on targets.  It affects the
       methods that the <u>Xcode</u> generator uses to link different kinds of libraries.  Its default value is <b>NONE</b>.

       This   variable   is   the   composite  of  <u>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME</u>  and  <u>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION</u>,  e.g.
       <b>${CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION}</b>.  If <u>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION</u> is  not  set,  then
       this variable is the same as <u>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME</b>
       Name of the OS CMake is running on.

       On  systems that have the uname command, this variable is set to the output of <b>uname</b> <b>-s</b>.  <b>Linux</b>, <b>Windows</b>,
       and <b>Darwin</b> for macOS are the values found on the big three operating systems.

       For a list of possible values, see <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR</b>
       The name of the CPU CMake is running on.

   <b>Windows</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       On Windows, this variable is set to the value of the environment variable <b>PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE</b>.

   <b>Unix</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       On systems that support <b>uname</b>, this variable is set to the output of:

       • <b>uname</b> <b>-m</b> on GNU, Linux, Cygwin, Android, or

       • <b>arch</b> on OpenBSD, or

       • on other systems,

         • <b>uname</b> <b>-p</b> if its exit code is nonzero, or

         • <b>uname</b> <b>-m</b> otherwise.

   <b>macOS</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       The value of <b>uname</b> <b>-m</b> is used by default.

       On Apple Silicon hosts, the architecture printed by <b>uname</b> <b>-m</b> may vary based on CMake's  own  architecture
       and that of the invoking process tree.

       Added in version 3.19.2: On Apple Silicon hosts:

       • The  <u>CMAKE_APPLE_SILICON_PROCESSOR</u>  variable  or the <u>CMAKE_APPLE_SILICON_PROCESSOR</u> environment variable
         may be set to specify the host architecture explicitly.

       • If <u>CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES</u> is not set, CMake adds explicit flags to tell the compiler to build for  the
         host architecture so the toolchain does not have to guess based on the process tree's architecture.

   <b>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION</b>
       The OS version CMake is running on.

       A  numeric  version  string  for  the system.  On systems that support <b>uname</b>, this variable is set to the
       output of <b>uname</b> <b>-r</b>. On other systems this is set to major-minor version numbers.

   <b>CMAKE_HOST_UNIX</b>
       <b>True</b> for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems.

       Set to <b>true</b> when the host system is UNIX or UNIX like (i.e.  APPLE and CYGWIN).

   <b>CMAKE_HOST_WIN32</b>
       <b>True</b> if the host system is running Windows, including Windows 64-bit and MSYS.

       Set to <b>false</b> on Cygwin.

   <b>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</b>
       Target architecture library directory name, if detected.

       This is the value of <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u> as detected for one of the enabled languages.

   <b>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE_REGEX</b>
       Regex matching possible target architecture library directory names.

       This is used to detect <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</u> from the implicit linker search path by matching
       the <b>&lt;arch&gt;</b> name.

   <b>CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX</b>
       Maximum object file full-path length allowed by native build tools.

       CMake computes for every source file an  object  file  name  that  is  unique  to  the  source  file  and
       deterministic  with  respect to the full path to the source file.  This allows multiple source files in a
       target to share the same name if they lie in different directories without rebuilding when one  is  added
       or  removed.   However, it can produce long full paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path using a
       hashing scheme when the full path to an object file exceeds a limit.  CMake has a built-in limit for each
       platform that is sufficient for common tools, but some  native  tools  may  have  a  lower  limit.   This
       variable may be set to specify the limit explicitly.  The value must be an integer no less than 128.

   <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM</b>
       Composite name of operating system CMake is compiling for.

       This    variable    is    the    composite    of   <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u>   and   <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION</u>,   e.g.
       <b>${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION}</b>.  If <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION</u> is not set, then this variable  is
       the same as <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</b>
       The  name of the operating system for which CMake is to build.  See the <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION</u> variable for
       the OS version.

       Note that <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</b> is not set to anything by default when running in script mode, since it's not
       building anything.

   <b>System</b> <b>Name</b> <b>for</b> <b>Host</b> <b>Builds</b>
       <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</b> is by default set to the same value as the <u>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME</u> variable so that  the
       build targets the host system.

   <b>System</b> <b>Name</b> <b>for</b> <b>Cross</b> <b>Compiling</b>
       <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</b>  may be set explicitly when first configuring a new build tree in order to enable <u>cross</u>
       <u>compiling</u>.  In this case the <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION</u> variable must also be set explicitly.

   <b>System</b> <b>Names</b> <b>Known</b> <b>to</b> <b>CMake</b>

       Platform-specific notes:

       • MSYS2's <b>msys/cmake</b> package (<b>/usr/bin/cmake</b>) works only under  <b>MSYSTEM=MSYS</b>  environments,  with  system
         name   <b>MSYS</b>.    Under   other   environments   like   <b>MSYSTEM=MINGW64</b>,  use  another  package  such  as
         <b>mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake</b> (<b>/mingw64/bin/cmake</b>), which targets  <b>MSYSTEM=MINGW64</b>  with  system  name
         <b>Windows</b>.

       • Cygwin's  <b>cmake</b>  package (<b>/usr/bin/cmake</b>) uses system name <b>CYGWIN</b>.  A non-cygwin CMake on Windows (e.g.
         <b>$PROGRAMFILES/CMake/bin/cmake</b>) uses system name <b>Windows</b> even when it runs under a Cygwin environment.

   <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR</b>
       When not cross-compiling, this variable has the same value as the  <u>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR</u>  variable.
       In many cases, this will correspond to the target architecture for the build, but this is not guaranteed.
       (E.g. on Windows, the host may be <b>AMD64</b> even when using a MSVC <b>cl</b> compiler with a 32-bit target.)

       When  cross-compiling,  a  <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u>  should  set the <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR</b> variable to match
       target    architecture    that    it     specifies     (via     <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER</u>     and     perhaps
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_TARGET</u>).

   <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION</b>
       The  version of the operating system for which CMake is to build.  See the <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u> variable for
       the OS name.

   <b>System</b> <b>Version</b> <b>for</b> <b>Host</b> <b>Builds</b>
       When the <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u> variable takes its default value then <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION</b> is by  default  set
       to  the  same  value  as the <u>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION</u> variable so that the build targets the host system
       version.

       In the case of a host build then <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION</b> may be set explicitly when first configuring a  new
       build  tree  in  order to enable targeting the build for a different version of the host operating system
       than is actually running on the host.  This is allowed and not considered cross compiling so long as  the
       binaries built for the specified OS version can still run on the host.

   <b>System</b> <b>Version</b> <b>for</b> <b>Cross</b> <b>Compiling</b>
       When  the  <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u>  variable  is  set  explicitly  to  enable <u>cross</u> <u>compiling</u> then the value of
       <b>CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION</b> must also be set explicitly to specify the target system version.

   <b>CYGWIN</b>
       <b>True</b> for Cygwin.

       Set to <b>true</b> when using Cygwin.

   <b>GHSMULTI</b>
       Added in version 3.3.

       <b>1</b> when using <u>Green</u> <u>Hills</u> <u>MULTI</u> generator.

       Also, Set to <b>1</b> when the target  system  is  a  Green  Hills  platform  (i.e.  When  <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u>  is
       <b>GHS-MULTI</b>).

   <b>IOS</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       Set to <b>1</b> when the target system (<u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u>) is <b>iOS</b>.

   <b>LINUX</b>
       Added in version 3.25.

       Set to true when the target system is Linux.

   <b>MINGW</b>
       Added in version 3.2.

       Set  to  a  true  value  when  at  least one language is enabled with a compiler targeting the GNU ABI on
       Windows (MinGW).

       Otherwise, this variable is not set by CMake.

   <b>MSVC</b>
       Set to <b>true</b> when the compiler is some version of Microsoft Visual C++ or another compiler simulating  the
       Visual C++ <b>cl</b> command-line syntax.

       See also the <u>MSVC_VERSION</u> variable.

   <b>MSVC_IDE</b>
       <b>True</b> when using the Microsoft Visual C++ IDE.

       Set  to  <b>true</b>  when  the  target platform is the Microsoft Visual C++ IDE, as opposed to the command line
       compiler.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This variable is only available after compiler detection has been performed, so it is not available to
          toolchain files or before the first <u>project()</u>  or  <u>enable_language()</u>  call  which  uses  an  MSVC-like
          compiler.

   <b>MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       The  toolset  version  of  Microsoft  Visual  C/C++  being used if any.  If MSVC-like is being used, this
       variable is set based on the version of the compiler as given by the <u>MSVC_VERSION</u> variable.

       Known toolset version numbers are:

          80        = VS 2005 (8.0)
          90        = VS 2008 (9.0)
          100       = VS 2010 (10.0)
          110       = VS 2012 (11.0)
          120       = VS 2013 (12.0)
          140       = VS 2015 (14.0)
          141       = VS 2017 (15.0)
          142       = VS 2019 (16.0)
          143       = VS 2022 (17.0)

       Compiler versions newer than those known to CMake will be reported as the latest known toolset version.

       See also the <u>MSVC_VERSION</u> variable.

   <b>MSVC_VERSION</b>
       The version of Microsoft Visual C/C++ being used if any.  If a compiler simulating Visual  C++  is  being
       used,  this  variable  is  set  to  the  toolset  version simulated as given by the <b>_MSC_VER</b> preprocessor
       definition.

       Known version numbers are:

          1200      = VS  6.0
          1300      = VS  7.0
          1310      = VS  7.1
          1400      = VS  8.0 (v80 toolset)
          1500      = VS  9.0 (v90 toolset)
          1600      = VS 10.0 (v100 toolset)
          1700      = VS 11.0 (v110 toolset)
          1800      = VS 12.0 (v120 toolset)
          1900      = VS 14.0 (v140 toolset)
          1910-1919 = VS 15.0 (v141 toolset)
          1920-1929 = VS 16.0 (v142 toolset)
          1930-1949 = VS 17.0 (v143 toolset)

   <b>UNIX</b>
       Set to <b>True</b> when the target system is UNIX or UNIX-like (e.g. <u>APPLE</u> and <u>CYGWIN</u>).   The  <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u>
       variable should be queried if a more specific understanding of the target system is required.

   <b>WASI</b>
       Added in version 3.31.

       Set to <b>1</b> when the target system is WebAssembly System Interface (<u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u> is <b>WASI</b>).

   <b>WIN32</b>
       Set to <b>True</b> when the target system is Windows, including Win64.

   <b>WINCE</b>

   <b>CMAKE_AUTOGEN_VERBOSE</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       Sets the verbosity of <u>AUTOMOC</u>, <u>AUTOUIC</u> and <u>AUTORCC</u>.  A positive integer value or  a  true  boolean  value
       lets the <b>AUTO*</b> generators output additional processing information.

       Setting  <b>CMAKE_AUTOGEN_VERBOSE</b>  has  the  same  effect as setting the <b>VERBOSE</b> environment variable during
       generation (e.g. by calling <b>make</b> <b>VERBOSE=1</b>).  The extra verbosity is  limited  to  the  <b>AUTO*</b>  generators
       though.

       When  a  non-executable  target  is  created its <u>&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX</u> target property is initialized with the
       value of this variable if it is set.

   <b>CMAKE_CROSS_CONFIGS</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       Specifies a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of configurations available from all <b>build-&lt;Config&gt;.ninja</b>  files  in
       the  <u>Ninja</u>  <u>Multi-Config</u>  generator.  This variable activates cross-config mode. Targets from each config
       specified in this variable can be built from any <b>build-&lt;Config&gt;.ninja</b> file. Custom commands will use  the
       configuration   native   to   <b>build-&lt;Config&gt;.ninja</b>.  If  it  is  set  to  <b>all</b>,  all  configurations  from
       <u>CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES</u> are cross-configs. If it is not specified, or empty, each  <b>build-&lt;Config&gt;.ninja</b>
       file will only contain build rules for its own configuration.

       The value of this variable must be a subset of <u>CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_CTEST_ARGUMENTS</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       Set  this  to a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of command-line arguments to pass to <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> when running tests
       through the <b>test</b> (or <b>RUN_TESTS</b>) target of the generated build system.

   <b>CMAKE_CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Default value for <u>CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS</u> target property when defined. By default this  variable  is
       not defined.

       This variable is used to initialize the property on each target as it is created.

   <b>CMAKE_CUDA_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       Select  the  CUDA  runtime  library  for  use  when compiling and linking CUDA.  This variable is used to
       initialize the <u>CUDA_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</u> property on all targets as they are created.

       The allowed case insensitive values are:

       <b>None</b>   Link with <b>-cudart=none</b> or equivalent flag(s) to use no CUDA runtime library.

       <b>Shared</b> Link with <b>-cudart=shared</b> or equivalent flag(s) to use a dynamically-linked CUDA runtime library.

       <b>Static</b> Link with <b>-cudart=static</b> or equivalent flag(s) to use a statically-linked CUDA runtime library.

       Contents of <b>CMAKE_CUDA_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</b> may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       If this variable is not set then the <u>CUDA_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</u> target property will not be set  automatically.
       If  that property is not set then CMake uses an appropriate default value based on the compiler to select
       the CUDA runtime library.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This property has effect only when the <b>CUDA</b> language is enabled. To control the CUDA  runtime  linking
          when only using the CUDA SDK with the <b>C</b> or <b>C++</b> language we recommend using the <u>FindCUDAToolkit</u> module.

   <b>CMAKE_CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       Default  value  for  <u>CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION</u> target property.  This variable is used to initialize the
       property on each target as it is created.

   <b>CMAKE_CXX_MODULE_STD</b>
       Added in version 3.30.

       Whether to add utility targets as dependencies to targets with at least <b>cxx_std_23</b> or not.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This setting is meaningful only when experimental support for <b>import</b> <b>std;</b>  has  been  enabled  by  the
          <b>CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX_IMPORT_STD</b> gate.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>CXX_MODULE_STD</u> property on all targets.  See that target property
       for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES</b>
       Added in version 3.28.

       Whether to scan C++ source files for module dependencies.

       This  variable  is  used  to  initialize  the <u>CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES</u> property on all the targets.  See that
       target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX</b>
       See variable <u>CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX</u>.

       This variable is a special case  of  the  more-general  <u>CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX</u>  variable  for  the  <u>DEBUG</u>
       configuration.

   <b>CMAKE_DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       Specifies  the configuration to use by default in a <b>build.ninja</b> file in the <u>Ninja</u> <u>Multi-Config</u> generator.
       If this variable is specified, <b>build.ninja</b> uses build rules from  <b>build-&lt;Config&gt;.ninja</b>  by  default.  All
       custom  commands  are  executed with this configuration. If the variable is not specified, the first item
       from <u>CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES</u> is used instead.

       The value of this variable must be one of the items from <u>CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_DEFAULT_CONFIGS</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       Specifies a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of configurations to  build  for  a  target  in  <b>build.ninja</b>  if  no
       <b>:&lt;Config&gt;</b>  suffix  is  specified  in  the  <u>Ninja</u>  <u>Multi-Config</u>  generator.  If  it  is  set  to  <b>all</b>, all
       configurations  from  <u>CMAKE_CROSS_CONFIGS</u>  are  used.  If  it  is   not   specified,   it   defaults   to
       <u>CMAKE_DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE</u>.

       For  example,  if  you set <u>CMAKE_DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE</u> to <b>Release</b>, but set <b>CMAKE_DEFAULT_CONFIGS</b> to <b>Debug</b> or
       <b>all</b>, all <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> aliases in <b>build.ninja</b> will resolve  to  <b>&lt;target&gt;:Debug</b>  or  <b>&lt;target&gt;:all</b>,  but  custom
       commands will still use the <b>Release</b> configuration.

       The   value   of   this   variable   must   be  a  subset  of  <u>CMAKE_CROSS_CONFIGS</u>  or  be  the  same  as
       <u>CMAKE_DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE</u>. It must not be specified if <u>CMAKE_DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE</u> or <u>CMAKE_CROSS_CONFIGS</u>  is
       not used.

   <b>CMAKE_DEPENDS_USE_COMPILER</b>
       Added in version 3.20.

       For  the <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u>, source dependencies are now, for a selection of compilers, generated by the
       compiler itself. By defining this variable with value <b>FALSE</b>, you can restore the  legacy  behavior  (i.e.
       using CMake for dependencies discovery).

   <b>CMAKE_DISABLE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Default value for <u>DISABLE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</u> of targets.

       By default <b>CMAKE_DISABLE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS</b> is <b>OFF</b>.

       Value used to initialize  the  <u>CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS</u>  cache  entry  the  first  time  a  build  tree  is
       configured.   This  variable is meant to be set by a <u>toolchain</u> <u>file</u>.  CMake may prepend or append content
       to the value based on the environment and target platform.

       See also the configuration-specific variable <u>CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_INIT</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_EXPORT_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME</b>
       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Experimental. Gated by <b>CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_EXPORT_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_FOLDER</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       Set the folder name. Use to organize targets in an IDE.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>FOLDER</u> property on all the targets.  See that target property for
       additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT</b>
       Set to <b>FIXED</b> or <b>FREE</b> to indicate the Fortran source layout.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>Fortran_FORMAT</u> property on all  the  targets.   See  that  target
       property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY</b>
       Fortran module output directory.

       This  variable  is used to initialize the <u>Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY</u> property on all the targets.  See that

   <b>CMAKE_Fortran_PREPROCESS</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       Default value for <u>Fortran_PREPROCESS</u> of targets.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>Fortran_PREPROCESS</u> property on all the targets.  See that  target
       property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       This  variable is used to initialize the <u>FRAMEWORK</u> property on all the targets.  See that target property
       for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_MULTI_CONFIG_POSTFIX_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       Default framework filename postfix under configuration <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> when using a multi-config generator.

       When a framework  target  is  created  its  <u>FRAMEWORK_MULTI_CONFIG_POSTFIX_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>  target  property  is
       initialized with the value of this variable if it is set.

   <b>CMAKE_GHS_NO_SOURCE_GROUP_FILE</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       <b>ON</b> / <b>OFF</b> boolean to control if the project file for a target should be one single file or multiple files.
       Refer to <u>GHS_NO_SOURCE_GROUP_FILE</u> for further details.

   <b>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       Switch to enable generation of a global <b>autogen</b> target.

       When  <b>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET</b>  is enabled, a custom target <b>autogen</b> is generated.  This target depends
       on all <u>AUTOMOC</u> and <u>AUTOUIC</u> generated <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u> targets in the project.  By building the
       global <b>autogen</b> target, all <u>AUTOMOC</u> and <u>AUTOUIC</u> files in the project will be generated.

       The name of the global <b>autogen</b> target can be changed by setting <u>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET_NAME</u>.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u> targets by default inherit their origin target's dependencies. This  might
          result in unintended dependency target builds when only <u>The</u> <u>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_autogen</u> <u>target</u> targets are built.
          A solution is to disable <u>AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS</u> on the respective origin targets.

   <b>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET_NAME</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       Change the name of the global <b>autogen</b> target.

       When   <u>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET</u>  is  enabled,  a  global  custom  target  named  <b>autogen</b>  is  created.
       <b>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET_NAME</b> allows to set a different name for that target.

       By default <b>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET_NAME</b> is unset.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTORCC_TARGET</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       Switch to enable generation of a global <b>autorcc</b> target.

       When <b>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTORCC_TARGET</b> is enabled, a custom target <b>autorcc</b> is generated. This target depends on
       all <u>AUTORCC</u> generated <b>&lt;ORIGIN&gt;_arcc_&lt;QRC&gt;</b> targets in the project.  By building the global <b>autorcc</b> target,
       all <u>AUTORCC</u> files in the project will be generated.

       The name of the global <b>autorcc</b> target can be changed by setting <u>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTORCC_TARGET_NAME</u>.

       By default <b>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTORCC_TARGET</b> is unset.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTORCC_TARGET_NAME</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       Change the name of the global <b>autorcc</b> target.

       When  <u>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTORCC_TARGET</u>  is  enabled,  a  global  custom  target  named  <b>autorcc</b>  is   created.
       <b>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTORCC_TARGET_NAME</b> allows to set a different name for that target.

       By default <b>CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTORCC_TARGET_NAME</b> is unset.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> manual for more information on using CMake with Qt.

   <b>CMAKE_GNUtoMS</b>
       Convert GNU import libraries (<b>.dll.a</b>) to MS format (<b>.lib</b>).

       This  variable  is  used  to  initialize the <u>GNUtoMS</u> property on targets when they are created.  See that
       target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR</b>
       Automatically add the current source and build directories to the include path.

       If   this   variable   is   enabled,    CMake    automatically    adds    <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>    and
       <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u> to the include path for each directory.  These additional include directories do
       not  propagate  down  to  subdirectories.   This  is  useful mainly for out-of-source builds, where files
       generated into the build tree are included by files located in the source tree.

       By default <b>CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR</b> is <b>OFF</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE</b>
       Automatically add the current source and build directories to  the  <u>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>  target
       property.

       If  this  variable  is  enabled,  CMake automatically adds for each shared library target, static library
       target, module target and executable target, <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u> and <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u> to the
       <u>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> target property.  By default <b>CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE</b> is <b>OFF</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR</b>
       Directory name for installed targets on Apple platforms.

       <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR</b> is used to initialize the <u>INSTALL_NAME_DIR</u> property  on  all  targets.   See  that
       target property for more information.

   <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Sets the default for whether toolchain-defined rpaths should be removed during installation.

       <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH</b>   is   a   boolean   that  provides  the  default  value  for  the
       <u>INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH</u> property of all subsequently created targets.

   <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH</b>
       The rpath to use for installed targets.

       A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed targets (for platforms  that  support
       it).  This is used to initialize the target property <u>INSTALL_RPATH</u> for all targets.

   <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH</b>
       Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

       <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH</b> is a boolean that if set to <b>True</b> will append to the runtime search path
       (rpath)  of  installed binaries any directories outside the project that are in the linker search path or
       contain linked library files.  The directories are appended after the value of the  <u>INSTALL_RPATH</u>  target
       property.

       This variable is used to initialize the target property <u>INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH</u> for all targets.

   <b>CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Default value for <u>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION</u> of targets.

       This  variable  is  used to initialize the <u>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION</u> property on all the targets.  See
       that target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Default value for <u>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> of targets.

       This variable is used  to  initialize  the  <u>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>  property  on  all  the
       targets.  See that target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CLANG_TIDY</b>
       Added in version 3.6.

       Default value for <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CLANG_TIDY</u> target property when <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> is <b>C</b>, <b>CXX</b>, <b>OBJC</b> or <b>OBJCXX</b>.

       This variable is used to initialize the property on each target as it is created.  For example:

          set(CMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY clang-tidy -checks=-*,readability-*)
          add_executable(foo foo.cxx)

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CLANG_TIDY_EXPORT_FIXES_DIR</b>

          add_executable(foo foo.cxx)

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LAUNCHER</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Default value for <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LAUNCHER</u> target property.  This variable  is  used  to  initialize  the
       property  on  each target as it is created.  This is done only when <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> is <b>C</b>, <b>CXX</b>, <b>Fortran</b>, <b>HIP</b>, <b>ISPC</b>,
       <b>OBJC</b>, <b>OBJCXX</b>, or <b>CUDA</b>.

       This variable is initialized to the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LAUNCHER</u> environment variable if it is set.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPCHECK</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       Default value for <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPCHECK</u> target property. This variable is used to initialize  the  property  on
       each target as it is created.  This is done only when <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> is <b>C</b> or <b>CXX</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CPPLINT</b>

       each target as it is created.  This is done only when <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> is <b>C</b> or <b>CXX</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE</b>
       Added in version 3.3.

       Default value for <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE</u> target property.  This variable is used to  initialize  the
       property on each target as it is created.  This is done only when <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> is <b>C</b> or <b>CXX</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       This  variable  defines  how  to  link a group of libraries for the specified <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b> when a <u>LINK_GROUP</u>
       generator expression is used and the link language for the target is <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.  For this variable  to  have
       any  effect,  the  associated  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u>  variable must be set to
       true.

       The <u>CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u> variable should be defined instead for features that are independent
       of the link language.

       Feature names are case-sensitive and may only contain letters, numbers and  underscores.   Feature  names
       defined  in all uppercase are reserved for CMake's own built-in features (see <u>Predefined</u> <u>Features</u> further
       below).

   <b>Feature</b> <b>Definitions</b>
       A group feature definition is a list that contains exactly two elements:

          &lt;PREFIX&gt; &lt;SUFFIX&gt;

       On the linker command line, <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;</b> will precede the list of libraries in the group  and  <b>&lt;SUFFIX&gt;</b>  will
       follow after.

       For the elements of this variable, the <b>LINKER:</b> prefix can be used.

       To  pass  options  to the linker tool, each compiler driver has its own syntax.  The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix and <b>,</b>
       separator can be used to specify, in a portable way, options to pass  to  the  linker  tool.  <b>LINKER:</b>  is
       replaced  by  the appropriate driver option and <b>,</b> by the appropriate driver separator.  The driver prefix
       and  driver  separator  are  given  by   the   values   of   the   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG</u>   and
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP</u> variables.

       For example, <b>"LINKER:-z,defs"</b> becomes <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>-z</b> <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>defs</b> for <b>Clang</b> and <b>-Wl,-z,defs</b> for <b>GNU</b> <b>GCC</b>.

       The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix can be specified as part of a <b>SHELL:</b> prefix expression.

       The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix supports, as an alternative syntax, specification of arguments using the <b>SHELL:</b> prefix
       and space as separator. The previous example then becomes <b>"LINKER:SHELL:-z</b> <b>defs"</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Specifying  the  <b>SHELL:</b>  prefix  anywhere  other  than  at  the beginning of the <b>LINKER:</b> prefix is not
          supported.

   <b>Examples</b>
   <b>Solving</b> <b>cross-references</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>static</b> <b>libraries</b>
       A project may define two or more static libraries which have  circular  dependencies  between  them.   In
       order  for  the  linker  to  resolve all symbols at link time, it may need to search repeatedly among the
       libraries until no new undefined references are created.  Different  linkers  use  different  syntax  for
       achieving  this.   The  following  example shows how this may be implemented for some linkers.  Note that
       this is for illustration purposes only.  Projects should use the built-in <b>RESCAN</b>  group  feature  instead
       (see  <u>Predefined</u>  <u>Features</u>),  which  provides  a  more  complete  and  more robust implementation of this
       functionality.

          set(CMAKE_C_LINK_GROUP_USING_cross_refs_SUPPORTED TRUE)
          if(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "GNU" AND CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Linux")
            set(CMAKE_C_LINK_GROUP_USING_cross_refs
              "LINKER:--start-group"
              "LINKER:--end-group"
            )
          elseif(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "SunPro" AND CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "SunOS")
            set(CMAKE_C_LINK_GROUP_USING_cross_refs
              "LINKER:-z,rescan-start"
              "LINKER:-z,rescan-end"
            )
          else()
            # feature not yet supported for the other environments
            set(CMAKE_C_LINK_GROUP_USING_cross_refs_SUPPORTED FALSE)
          endif()

          add_library(lib1 STATIC ...)
          add_library(lib2 SHARED ...)

          if(CMAKE_C_LINK_GROUP_USING_cross_refs_SUPPORTED)
            target_link_libraries(lib2 PRIVATE "$&lt;LINK_GROUP:cross_refs,lib1,external&gt;")
          else()
            target_link_libraries(lib2 PRIVATE lib1 external)
          endif()

       CMake will generate the following linker command line fragments when linking <b>lib2</b>:

       • <b>GNU</b>: <b>-Wl,--start-group</b> <b>/path/to/lib1.a</b> <b>-lexternal</b> <b>-Wl,--end-group</b>

       • <b>SunPro</b>: <b>-Wl,-z,rescan-start</b> <b>/path/to/lib1.a</b> <b>-lexternal</b> <b>-Wl,-z,rescan-end</b>

   <b>Predefined</b> <b>Features</b>
       The following built-in group features are pre-defined by CMake:

       <b>RESCAN</b> Some linkers are single-pass only.   For  such  linkers,  circular  references  between  libraries
              typically result in unresolved symbols.  This feature instructs the linker to search the specified
              static libraries repeatedly until no new undefined references are created.

              Normally,  a static library is searched only once in the order that it is specified on the command
              line.  If a symbol in that library is needed to resolve an undefined  symbol  referred  to  by  an
              object  in  a  library  that  appears  later  on the command line, the linker would not be able to
              resolve that reference.  By grouping the static libraries with the <b>RESCAN</b> feature, they  will  all
              be  searched  repeatedly until all possible references are resolved.  This will use linker options
              like <b>--start-group</b> and <b>--end-group</b>, or on SunOS, <b>-z</b> <b>rescan-start</b> and <b>-z</b> <b>rescan-end</b>.

              Using this feature has a significant performance cost. It is best to use it only  when  there  are
              unavoidable circular references between two or more static libraries.

              This feature is available when using toolchains that target Linux, BSD, and SunOS.  It can also be
              used when targeting Windows platforms if the GNU toolchain is used.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       This  variable  specifies  whether  the  <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b>  is  supported  for the link language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.  If this
       variable is true, then the <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b> must be defined by <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u>, and  the
       more  generic  <u>CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u>  and <u>CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u> variables
       are not used.

       If   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</b>   is   false   or   is   not   set,    then    the
       <u>CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u>  variable  will  determine  whether  <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b> is deemed to be
       supported.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_ATTRIBUTES</b>
       Added in version 3.30.

       This variable defines the semantics of the specified link library <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b> when linking  with  the  link
       language  <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.  It  takes  precedence over <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_ATTRIBUTES</u> if that variable is
       also   defined   for   the   same    <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b>,    but    otherwise    has    similar    effects.     See
       <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_ATTRIBUTES</u> for further details.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_FILE_FLAG</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Language-specific flag to be used to link a library specified by a path to its file.

       The flag will be used before a library file path is given to the linker.  This is needed only on very few
       platforms.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_FLAG</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Flag to be used to link a library into a shared library or executable.

       This flag will be used to specify a library to link to a shared library or an executable for the specific
       language.  On most compilers this is <b>-l</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       This  variable defines how to link a library or framework for the specified <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b> when a <u>LINK_LIBRARY</u>
       generator expression is used and the link language for the target is <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.  For this variable  to  have
       any  effect,  the  associated <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u> variable must be set to
       true.

       The  <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u>  variable  should  be  defined  instead  for  features  that  are
       independent of the link language.

       Feature  names  are  case-sensitive and may only contain letters, numbers and underscores.  Feature names
       defined in all uppercase are reserved for CMake's own built-in features (see <u>Predefined</u> <u>Features</u>  further
       below).

       Some aspects of feature behavior can be defined by the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_ATTRIBUTES</u> and
       <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_ATTRIBUTES</u> variables.

   <b>Feature</b> <b>Definitions</b>
       A library feature definition is a list that contains one or three elements:

          [&lt;PREFIX&gt;] &lt;LIBRARY_EXPRESSION&gt; [&lt;SUFFIX&gt;]

       When  <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;</b>  and  <b>&lt;SUFFIX&gt;</b>  are  specified,  they  precede  and  follow respectively the whole list of
       libraries specified in the <u>LINK_LIBRARY</u> expression, not each library  item  individually.   There  is  no
       guarantee  that the list of specified libraries will be kept grouped together though, so the <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;</b> and
       <b>&lt;SUFFIX&gt;</b> may appear more than once if  the  library  list  is  reorganized  by  CMake  to  satisfy  other
       constraints.   This  means  constructs  like  <b>--start-group</b>  and  <b>--end-group</b>, as supported by the GNU <b>ld</b>
       linker, cannot be used in this way.  The <u>LINK_GROUP</u> generator expression should be used instead for  such
       constructs.

       <b>&lt;LIBRARY_EXPRESSION&gt;</b>  is  used  to specify the pattern for constructing the corresponding fragment on the
       linker command line for each library.  The following placeholders can be used in the expression:

       • <b>&lt;LIBRARY&gt;</b> is expanded to the full path to the library for CMake  targets,  or  to  a  platform-specific
         value  based  on  the  item otherwise (the same as <b>&lt;LINK_ITEM&gt;</b> on Windows, or the library base name for
         other platforms).

       • <b>&lt;LINK_ITEM&gt;</b> is expanded to how the library would normally be linked on the linker command line.

       • <b>&lt;LIB_ITEM&gt;</b> is expanded to the full path to the library for CMake targets, or the item itself exactly as
         specified in the <b>&lt;LIBRARY_EXPRESSION&gt;</b> otherwise.

       In addition to the above, it is possible to have one  pattern  for  paths  (CMake  targets  and  external
       libraries  specified with file paths) and another for other items specified by name only.  The <b>PATH{}</b> and
       <b>NAME{}</b> wrappers can be used to provide the expansion for those two cases,  respectively.   When  wrappers
       are used, both must be present.  For example:

          set(CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_weak_library
              "PATH{-weak_library &lt;LIBRARY&gt;}NAME{LINKER:-weak-l&lt;LIB_ITEM&gt;}"
          )

       For  all  three  elements  of  this  variable (<b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;LIBRARY_EXPRESSION&gt;</b>, and <b>&lt;SUFFIX&gt;</b>), the <b>LINKER:</b>
       prefix can be used.

       To pass options to the linker tool, each compiler driver has its own syntax.  The <b>LINKER:</b>  prefix  and  <b>,</b>
       separator  can  be  used  to  specify,  in a portable way, options to pass to the linker tool. <b>LINKER:</b> is
       replaced by the appropriate driver option and <b>,</b> by the appropriate driver separator.  The  driver  prefix
       and   driver   separator   are   given   by   the  values  of  the  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG</u>  and
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP</u> variables.

       For example, <b>"LINKER:-z,defs"</b> becomes <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>-z</b> <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>defs</b> for <b>Clang</b> and <b>-Wl,-z,defs</b> for <b>GNU</b> <b>GCC</b>.

       The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix can be specified as part of a <b>SHELL:</b> prefix expression.

       The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix supports, as an alternative syntax, specification of arguments using the <b>SHELL:</b> prefix
       and space as separator. The previous example then becomes <b>"LINKER:SHELL:-z</b> <b>defs"</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Specifying the <b>SHELL:</b> prefix anywhere other than at  the  beginning  of  the  <b>LINKER:</b>  prefix  is  not
          supported.

   <b>Examples</b>
   <b>Loading</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>static</b> <b>library</b>
       A  common  need  is  to  prevent the linker from discarding any symbols from a static library.  Different
       linkers use different syntax for achieving this.  The following example shows how this may be implemented
       for some linkers.  Note that this is for illustration purposes only.  Projects should  use  the  built-in
       <b>WHOLE_ARCHIVE</b>  feature  instead (see <u>Predefined</u> <u>Features</u>), which provides a more complete and more robust
       implementation of this functionality.

          set(CMAKE_C_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_load_archive_SUPPORTED TRUE)
          if(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "AppleClang")
            set(CMAKE_C_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_load_archive "-force_load &lt;LIB_ITEM&gt;")
          elseif(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "GNU" AND CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Linux")
            set(CMAKE_C_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_load_archive
              "LINKER:--push-state,--whole-archive"
              "&lt;LINK_ITEM&gt;"
              "LINKER:--pop-state"
            )
          elseif(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "MSVC")
            set(CMAKE_C_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_load_archive "/WHOLEARCHIVE:&lt;LIBRARY&gt;")
          else()
            # feature not yet supported for the other environments
            set(CMAKE_C_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_load_archive_SUPPORTED FALSE)
          endif()

          add_library(lib1 STATIC ...)
          add_library(lib2 SHARED ...)

          if(CMAKE_C_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_load_archive_SUPPORTED)
            # The -force_load Apple linker option requires a file name
            set(external_lib
              "$&lt;IF:$&lt;LINK_LANG_AND_ID:C,AppleClang&gt;,libexternal.a,external&gt;"
            )
            target_link_libraries(lib2 PRIVATE
              "$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:load_archive,lib1,${external_lib}&gt;"
            )
          else()
            target_link_libraries(lib2 PRIVATE lib1 external)
          endif()

       CMake will generate the following link expressions:

       • <b>AppleClang</b>: <b>-force_load</b> <b>/path/to/lib1.a</b> <b>-force_load</b> <b>libexternal.a</b>

       • <b>GNU</b>: <b>-Wl,--push-state,--whole-archive</b> <b>/path/to/lib1.a</b> <b>-lexternal</b> <b>-Wl,--pop-state</b>

       • <b>MSVC</b>: <b>/WHOLEARCHIVE:/path/to/lib1.lib</b> <b>/WHOLEARCHIVE:external.lib</b>

   <b>Linking</b> <b>a</b> <b>library</b> <b>as</b> <b>weak</b>
       On macOS, it is possible to link a library in weak mode (the library and all  references  are  marked  as
       weak  imports).   Different  flags  must  be  used  for  a library specified by file path compared to one
       specified by name.  This constraint can be solved using <b>PATH{}</b> and <b>NAME{}</b> wrappers.  Again, the following
       example shows how this may be implemented for some linkers, but it is  for  illustration  purposes  only.
       Projects  should  use  the  built-in  <b>WEAK_FRAMEWORK</b>  or  <b>WEAK_LIBRARY</b>  features  instead (see <u>Predefined</u>
       <u>Features</u>), which provide more complete and more robust implementations of this functionality.

          if (CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "AppleClang")
            set(CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_weak_library
                "PATH{-weak_library &lt;LIBRARY&gt;}NAME{LINKER:-weak-l&lt;LIB_ITEM&gt;}"
            )
            set(CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_weak_library_SUPPORTED TRUE)
          endif()

          add_library(lib SHARED ...)
          add_executable(main ...)
          if(CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_weak_library_SUPPORTED)
            target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE "$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:weak_library,lib,external&gt;")
          else()
            target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE lib external)
          endif()

       CMake will generate the following linker command line fragment when linking  <b>main</b>  using  the  <b>AppleClang</b>
       toolchain:

       <b>-weak_library</b> <b>/path/to/lib</b> <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>-weak-lexternal</b>.

   <b>Predefined</b> <b>Features</b>
       The following built-in library features are pre-defined by CMake:

       <b>DEFAULT</b>
              This  feature  corresponds to standard linking, essentially equivalent to using no feature at all.
              It is typically only  used  with  the  <u>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE</u>  and  <u>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE_&lt;LIBRARY&gt;</u>
              target properties.

       <b>WHOLE_ARCHIVE</b>
              Force  inclusion  of  all  members  of  a  static library.  This feature is only supported for the
              following platforms, with limitations as noted:

              • Linux.

              • All BSD variants.

              • SunOS.

              • All Apple variants.  The library must be specified as a CMake target name, a library  file  name
                (such  as <b>libfoo.a</b>), or a library file path (such as <b>/path/to/libfoo.a</b>).  Due to a limitation of
                the Apple linker, it cannot be specified as a plain library name like <b>foo</b>, where <b>foo</b>  is  not  a
                CMake target.

              • Windows.  When using a MSVC or MSVC-like toolchain, the MSVC version must be greater than 1900.

              • Cygwin.

              • MSYS.

       <b>FRAMEWORK</b>
              This  option  tells  the  linker to search for the specified framework using the <b>-framework</b> linker
              option.  It can only be used on Apple platforms, and only  with  a  linker  that  understands  the
              option used (i.e. the linker provided with Xcode, or one compatible with it).

              The framework can be specified as a CMake framework target, a bare framework name, or a file path.
              If a target is given, that target must have the <u>FRAMEWORK</u> target property set to true.  For a file
              path, if it contains a directory part, that directory will be added as a framework search path.

                 add_library(lib SHARED ...)
                 target_link_libraries(lib PRIVATE "$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:FRAMEWORK,/path/to/my_framework&gt;")

                 # The constructed linker command line will contain:
                 #   -F/path/to -framework my_framework

              File  paths must conform to one of the following patterns (<b>*</b> is a wildcard, and optional parts are
              shown as <b>[...]</b>):

                 • <b>[/path/to/]FwName[.framework]</b>

                 • <b>[/path/to/]FwName.framework/FwName[suffix]</b>

                 • <b>[/path/to/]FwName.framework/Versions/*/FwName[suffix]</b>

              Note that CMake recognizes and automatically handles framework targets,  even  without  using  the
              <u>$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:FRAMEWORK,...&gt;</u> expression.  The generator expression can still be used with a CMake
              target  if the project wants to be explicit about it, but it is not required to do so.  The linker
              command line may have some differences between using the generator  expression  or  not,  but  the
              final result should be the same.  On the other hand, if a file path is given, CMake will recognize
              some    paths   automatically,   but   not   all   cases.    The   project   may   want   to   use
              <u>$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:FRAMEWORK,...&gt;</u> for file paths so that the expected behavior is clear.

              Added in version 3.25: The <u>FRAMEWORK_MULTI_CONFIG_POSTFIX_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> target property as well as  the
              <b>suffix</b> of the framework library name are now supported by the <b>FRAMEWORK</b> features.

       <b>NEEDED_FRAMEWORK</b>
              This  is  similar to the <b>FRAMEWORK</b> feature, except it forces the linker to link with the framework
              even if no symbols are used from it.  It uses the <b>-needed_framework</b> option and has the same linker
              constraints as <b>FRAMEWORK</b>.

       <b>REEXPORT_FRAMEWORK</b>
              This is similar to the <b>FRAMEWORK</b> feature, except it tells the linker that the framework should  be
              available to clients linking to the library being created.  It uses the <b>-reexport_framework</b> option
              and has the same linker constraints as <b>FRAMEWORK</b>.

       <b>WEAK_FRAMEWORK</b>
              This  is  similar  to the <b>FRAMEWORK</b> feature, except it forces the linker to mark the framework and
              all references to it as weak imports.  It uses the <b>-weak_framework</b> option and has the same  linker
              constraints as <b>FRAMEWORK</b>.

       <b>NEEDED_LIBRARY</b>
              This  is  similar to the <b>NEEDED_FRAMEWORK</b> feature, except it is for use with non-framework targets
              or libraries (Apple  platforms  only).   It  uses  the  <b>-needed_library</b>  or  <b>-needed-l</b>  option  as
              appropriate, and has the same linker constraints as <b>NEEDED_FRAMEWORK</b>.

       <b>REEXPORT_LIBRARY</b>
              This  is  similar  to  the  <b>REEXPORT_FRAMEWORK</b>  feature,   except it is for use with non-framework
              targets or libraries (Apple platforms only).  It uses the <b>-reexport_library</b> or <b>-reexport-l</b>  option
              as appropriate, and has the same linker constraints as <b>REEXPORT_FRAMEWORK</b>.

       <b>WEAK_LIBRARY</b>
              This  is similar to the <b>WEAK_FRAMEWORK</b> feature, except it is for use with non-framework targets or
              libraries (Apple platforms only).  It uses the <b>-weak_library</b> or <b>-weak-l</b> option as appropriate, and
              has the same linker constraints as <b>WEAK_FRAMEWORK</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       Set to <b>TRUE</b> if the  <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b>,  as  defined  by  variable  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u>,  is
       supported for the linker language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This       variable       is       evaluated      before      the      more      generic      variable
          <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE_FLAG</b>
       Added in version 3.22.

       Linker flag to be used to configure linker so that all specified libraries on the command  line  will  be
       linked into the target.

       See also variable <u>CMAKE_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE_CHECK</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_LAUNCHER</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       Default  value  for  <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_LAUNCHER</u>  target  property.  This  variable  is used to initialize the
       property on each target as it is created.  This is done only when <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> is <b>C</b>, <b>CXX</b>, <b>OBJC</b>, or <b>OBJCXX</b>.

       This variable is initialized to the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_LAUNCHER</u> environment variable if it is set.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_USING_LINKER_MODE</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       This controls how the value of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_USING_LINKER_&lt;TYPE&gt;</u> variable should be  interpreted.  The
       supported linker mode values are:

       <b>FLAG</b>   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_USING_LINKER_&lt;TYPE&gt;</u>  holds  a  <u>semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u> of flags to be passed to the
              compiler frontend.  This is also the default behavior  if  <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_USING_LINKER_MODE</b>  is  not
              set.

       <b>TOOL</b>   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_USING_LINKER_&lt;TYPE&gt;</u> holds the path to the linker tool.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_USING_LINKER_&lt;TYPE&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       This  variable  defines  how  to  specify  the  <b>&lt;TYPE&gt;</b>  linker  for  the  link step, as controlled by the
       <u>CMAKE_LINKER_TYPE</u>  variable  or  the  <u>LINKER_TYPE</u>  target  property.  Depending  on  the  value  of   the
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_USING_LINKER_MODE</u> variable, <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_USING_LINKER_&lt;TYPE&gt;</b> can hold compiler flags for the
       link step, or flags to be given directly to the linker tool.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The  specified  linker  tool  is  generally  expected  to  be  accessible through the <b>PATH</b> environment
          variable.

       For example, the <b>LLD</b> linker for <b>GNU</b> compilers is defined like so:

          set(CMAKE_C_USING_LINKER_LLD "-fuse-ld=lld")

       On the <b>Windows</b> platform with <b>Clang</b> compilers simulating <b>MSVC</b>:

          set(CMAKE_C_USING_LINKER_LLD "-fuse-ld=lld-link")

       And for the <b>MSVC</b> compiler, the linker is invoked directly, not via the compiler frontend:

          set(CMAKE_C_USING_LINKER_LLD "/path/to/lld-link.exe")
          set(CMAKE_C_USING_LINKER_MODE TOOL)

       A custom linker type can also be defined, usually in a toolchain file:

          set(CMAKE_LINKER_TYPE lld_launcher)
          set(CMAKE_C_USING_LINKER_lld_launcher "-fuse-ld=/path/to/lld-launcher.sh")
          set(CMAKE_C_USING_LINKER_MODE FLAG)

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET</b>
       Default value for the <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET</u> target property when a target is created.

   <b>CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</b>
       Where to put all the <u>LIBRARY</u> target files when built.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u> property on all the targets.   See  that
       target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.3.

       Where to put all the <u>LIBRARY</u> target files when built for a specific configuration.

       This  variable  is  used to initialize the <u>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> property on all the targets.
       See that target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH_FLAG</b>
       The flag to be used to add a library search path to a compiler.

       The flag will be used to specify a library directory to the compiler.  On most compilers this is <b>-L</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_DEF_FILE_FLAG</b>
       Linker flag to be used to specify a <b>.def</b> file for dll creation.

       The flag will be used to add a <b>.def</b> file when creating a dll on Windows; this is only defined on Windows.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED</b>
       Whether to skip link dependencies on shared library files.

       This variable initializes the <u>LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED</u> property on targets when they are created.  See that
       target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_DEPENDS_USE_LINKER</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       For the <u>Makefile</u> and <u>Ninja</u> generators, link dependencies are now, for a selection of  linkers,  generated
       by the linker itself. By defining this variable with value <b>FALSE</b>, you can deactivate this feature.

       This feature is also deactivated if the <u>LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED</u> target property is true.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          CMake  version  3.31.6  defaults  this  variable  to  <b>FALSE</b> if the linker is one from the GNU binutils
          linkers (<b>ld</b> and <b>ld.bfd</b> for version less than 2.41 or <b>ld.gold</b> for  any  version)  because  it  generate
          spurious dependencies on temporary files when LTO is enabled.  See <u>GNU</u> <u>bug</u> <u>30568</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       This  variable  defines  how  to  link a group of libraries for the specified <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b> when a <u>LINK_GROUP</u>
       generator expression is used.  Both of the following conditions must be met for this variable to have any
       effect:

       • The associated <u>CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u> variable must be set to true.

       • There   is   no   language-specific    definition    for    the    same    <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b>.     This    means
         <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u>  cannot  be  true  for  the link language used by the
         target for which the <u>LINK_GROUP</u> generator expression is evaluated.

       The <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u> variable should be defined  instead  for  features  that  are
       dependent on the link language.

       Feature  names  are  case-sensitive and may only contain letters, numbers and underscores.  Feature names
       defined in all uppercase are reserved for CMake's own built-in features (see <u>Predefined</u> <u>Features</u>  further
       below).

   <b>Feature</b> <b>Definitions</b>
       A group feature definition is a list that contains exactly two elements:

          &lt;PREFIX&gt; &lt;SUFFIX&gt;

       On  the  linker  command line, <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;</b> will precede the list of libraries in the group and <b>&lt;SUFFIX&gt;</b> will
       follow after.

       For the elements of this variable, the <b>LINKER:</b> prefix can be used.

       To pass options to the linker tool, each compiler driver has its own syntax.  The <b>LINKER:</b>  prefix  and  <b>,</b>
       separator  can  be  used  to  specify,  in a portable way, options to pass to the linker tool. <b>LINKER:</b> is
       replaced by the appropriate driver option and <b>,</b> by the appropriate driver separator.  The  driver  prefix
       and   driver   separator   are   given   by   the  values  of  the  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG</u>  and
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP</u> variables.

       For example, <b>"LINKER:-z,defs"</b> becomes <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>-z</b> <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>defs</b> for <b>Clang</b> and <b>-Wl,-z,defs</b> for <b>GNU</b> <b>GCC</b>.

       The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix can be specified as part of a <b>SHELL:</b> prefix expression.

       The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix supports, as an alternative syntax, specification of arguments using the <b>SHELL:</b> prefix
       and space as separator. The previous example then becomes <b>"LINKER:SHELL:-z</b> <b>defs"</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Specifying the <b>SHELL:</b> prefix anywhere other than at  the  beginning  of  the  <b>LINKER:</b>  prefix  is  not
          supported.

   <b>Examples</b>
   <b>Solving</b> <b>cross-references</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>static</b> <b>libraries</b>
       A  project  may  define  two  or more static libraries which have circular dependencies between them.  In
       order for the linker to resolve all symbols at link time, it may need  to  search  repeatedly  among  the
       libraries  until  no  new  undefined  references are created.  Different linkers use different syntax for
       achieving this.  The following example shows how this may be implemented for  some  linkers.   Note  that
       this  is  for  illustration purposes only.  Projects should use the built-in <b>RESCAN</b> group feature instead
       (see <u>Predefined</u> <u>Features</u>), which provides  a  more  complete  and  more  robust  implementation  of  this
       functionality.

          set(CMAKE_C_LINK_GROUP_USING_cross_refs_SUPPORTED TRUE)
          if(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "GNU" AND CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Linux")
            set(CMAKE_C_LINK_GROUP_USING_cross_refs
              "LINKER:--start-group"
              "LINKER:--end-group"
            )
          elseif(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "SunPro" AND CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "SunOS")
            set(CMAKE_C_LINK_GROUP_USING_cross_refs
              "LINKER:-z,rescan-start"
              "LINKER:-z,rescan-end"
            )
          else()
            # feature not yet supported for the other environments
            set(CMAKE_C_LINK_GROUP_USING_cross_refs_SUPPORTED FALSE)
          endif()

          add_library(lib1 STATIC ...)
          add_library(lib2 SHARED ...)

          if(CMAKE_C_LINK_GROUP_USING_cross_refs_SUPPORTED)
            target_link_libraries(lib2 PRIVATE "$&lt;LINK_GROUP:cross_refs,lib1,external&gt;")
          else()
            target_link_libraries(lib2 PRIVATE lib1 external)
          endif()

       CMake will generate the following linker command line fragments when linking <b>lib2</b>:

       • <b>GNU</b>: <b>-Wl,--start-group</b> <b>/path/to/lib1.a</b> <b>-lexternal</b> <b>-Wl,--end-group</b>

       • <b>SunPro</b>: <b>-Wl,-z,rescan-start</b> <b>/path/to/lib1.a</b> <b>-lexternal</b> <b>-Wl,-z,rescan-end</b>

   <b>Predefined</b> <b>Features</b>
       The following built-in group features are pre-defined by CMake:

       <b>RESCAN</b> Some  linkers  are  single-pass  only.   For  such  linkers, circular references between libraries
              typically result in unresolved symbols.  This feature instructs the linker to search the specified
              static libraries repeatedly until no new undefined references are created.

              Normally, a static library is searched only once in the order that it is specified on the  command
              line.   If  a  symbol  in  that library is needed to resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an
              object in a library that appears later on the command line,  the  linker  would  not  be  able  to
              resolve  that  reference.  By grouping the static libraries with the <b>RESCAN</b> feature, they will all
              be searched repeatedly until all possible references are resolved.  This will use  linker  options
              like <b>--start-group</b> and <b>--end-group</b>, or on SunOS, <b>-z</b> <b>rescan-start</b> and <b>-z</b> <b>rescan-end</b>.

              Using  this  feature  has a significant performance cost. It is best to use it only when there are
              unavoidable circular references between two or more static libraries.

              This feature is available when using toolchains that target Linux, BSD, and SunOS.  It can also be
              used when targeting Windows platforms if the GNU toolchain is used.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       This variable specifies whether the <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b> is supported regardless of  the  link  language.   If  this
       variable is true, then the <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b> must be defined by <u>CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u>.

       Note  that  this  variable has no effect if <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u> is true for
       the link language of the target.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</b>
       Default value for <u>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</u> of targets.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES</u> property on all the targets.   See  that
       target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARIES_STRATEGY</b>
       Added in version 3.31.

       Specify a strategy for ordering targets' direct link dependencies on linker command lines.

       If  set,  this  variable acts as the default value for the <u>LINK_LIBRARIES_STRATEGY</u> target property when a
       target is created.  Set that property directly to specify a strategy for a single target.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_ATTRIBUTES</b>
       Added in version 3.30.

       This variable defines the behavior of  the  specified  link  library  <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b>.  It  specifies  how  the
       <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b>  interacts  with  other  features, when the <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b> should be applied, and aspects of how the
       <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b> should be handled when CMake assembles the final linker command line (e.g. de-duplication).

       The   syntax    of    the    linker    flags    for    the    <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b>    are    controlled    by    the
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u>    and   <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u>   variables.    The
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u>   and    <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u>
       variables control whether the <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b> is available at all.

       When  linking for a particular language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>, <b>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_ATTRIBUTES</b> is ignored if the
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_ATTRIBUTES</u> variable is also defined for the same <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b>.

       The value of <b>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_ATTRIBUTES</b>  and  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_ATTRIBUTES</u>
       at the end of the directory scope in which a target is defined is what matters.

   <b>Feature</b> <b>Attributes</b> <b>Definition</b>
       A  feature  attributes  definition  is  a  <u>semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  of  <b>attribute=value(s)</b> items. If an
       attribute has multiple values, those values must be comma-separated.

       The following attributes are supported:

       <b>LIBRARY_TYPE=&lt;library-type-list&gt;</b>
              Specify the library types supported by the feature. Supported values are: <b>STATIC</b>, <b>SHARED</b>,  <b>MODULE</b>,
              and <b>EXECUTABLE</b>.

              If this attribute is not specified, the default is <b>LIBRARY_TYPE=STATIC,SHARED,MODULE,EXECUTABLE</b>.

              If  the  feature is used with an unsupported library type, CMake will emit a developer warning and
              the feature will be ignored.

       <b>OVERRIDE=&lt;feature-list&gt;</b>
              Specify which features this one replaces in the event of a conflict.  This override  mechanism  is
              superseded   by   <u>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE</u>   or   <u>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE_&lt;LIBRARY&gt;</u>   target   property
              definitions, if defined.

              If this attribute is not specified, the default is an empty list.

       <b>DEDUPLICATION=YES|NO|DEFAULT</b>
              Specify the de-duplication strategy for a library using this feature.

              <b>YES</b>    The library is always de-duplicated. The default strategy CMake  would  normally  apply  is
                     ignored.

              <b>NO</b>     The  library  is  never  de-duplicated.  The default strategy CMake would normally apply is
                     ignored.

              <b>DEFAULT</b>
                     Let CMake determine a de-duplication strategy automatically.

              If this attribute is not specified, <b>DEFAULT</b> will be used.

   <b>Example</b>
       A common need is the loading of a full archive as part of the creation of a shared library. The  built-in
       <b>WHOLE_ARCHIVE</b>  feature can be used for that purpose. The implementation of that built-in feature sets the
       following link library feature attributes:

          set(CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_WHOLE_ARCHIVE_ATTRIBUTES
            LIBRARY_TYPE=STATIC
            OVERRIDE=DEFAULT
            DEDUPLICATION=YES
          )

       <b>LIBRARY_TYPE=STATIC</b>
              This feature is only meaningful for static libraries.

       <b>OVERRIDE=DEFAULT</b>
              The <b>DEFAULT</b> feature will be overridden by the <b>WHOLE_ARCHIVE</b> feature because  they  are  compatible
              and     enhance     the     user's     experience:     standard    library    specification    and
              <b>$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:WHOLE_ARCHIVE&gt;</b> can be used freely.

       <b>DEDUPLICATION=YES</b>
              When this feature is used, the linker loads all symbols from the static library, so  there  is  no
              need to repeat the library on the linker command line.

       The <b>WHOLE_ARCHIVE</b> feature can be used like so:

          add_library(A STATIC ...)
          add_library(B STATIC ...)

          target_link_libraries(B PUBLIC A)
          target_link_libraries(A PUBLIC B)

          add_library(global SHARED ...)
          target_link_libraries(global PRIVATE $&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:WHOLE_ARCHIVE,A&gt;)

       The  resulting  link command will only have one instance of the <b>A</b> library specified, and the linker flags
       will ensure that all symbols are loaded from the <b>A</b> library.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FILE_FLAG</b>
       Flag to be used to link a library specified by a path to its file.

       The flag will be used before a library file path is given to the linker.  This is needed only on very few
       platforms.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FLAG</b>
       Flag to be used to link a library into an executable.

       The flag will be used to specify a library to link to an executable.  On most compilers this is <b>-l</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       This variable defines how to link a library or framework for the specified <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b> when a  <u>LINK_LIBRARY</u>
       generator expression is used.  Both of the following conditions must be met for this variable to have any
       effect:

       • The associated <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u> variable must be set to true.

       • There    is    no    language-specific    definition    for    the    same   <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b>.    This   means
         <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u> cannot be true for the link language  used  by  the
         target for which the <u>LINK_LIBRARY</u> generator expression is evaluated.

       Feature  names  are  case-sensitive and may only contain letters, numbers and underscores.  Feature names
       defined in all uppercase are reserved for CMake's own built-in features (see <u>Predefined</u> <u>Features</u>  further
       below).

       Some aspects of feature behavior can be defined by the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_ATTRIBUTES</u> and
       <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_ATTRIBUTES</u> variables.

   <b>Feature</b> <b>Definitions</b>
       A library feature definition is a list that contains one or three elements:

          [&lt;PREFIX&gt;] &lt;LIBRARY_EXPRESSION&gt; [&lt;SUFFIX&gt;]

       When  <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;</b>  and  <b>&lt;SUFFIX&gt;</b>  are  specified,  they  precede  and  follow respectively the whole list of
       libraries specified in the <u>LINK_LIBRARY</u> expression, not each library  item  individually.   There  is  no
       guarantee  that the list of specified libraries will be kept grouped together though, so the <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;</b> and
       <b>&lt;SUFFIX&gt;</b> may appear more than once if  the  library  list  is  reorganized  by  CMake  to  satisfy  other
       constraints.   This  means  constructs  like  <b>--start-group</b>  and  <b>--end-group</b>, as supported by the GNU <b>ld</b>
       linker, cannot be used in this way.  The <u>LINK_GROUP</u> generator expression should be used instead for  such
       constructs.

       <b>&lt;LIBRARY_EXPRESSION&gt;</b>  is  used  to specify the pattern for constructing the corresponding fragment on the
       linker command line for each library.  The following placeholders can be used in the expression:

       • <b>&lt;LIBRARY&gt;</b> is expanded to the full path to the library for CMake  targets,  or  to  a  platform-specific
         value  based  on  the  item otherwise (the same as <b>&lt;LINK_ITEM&gt;</b> on Windows, or the library base name for
         other platforms).

       • <b>&lt;LINK_ITEM&gt;</b> is expanded to how the library would normally be linked on the linker command line.

       • <b>&lt;LIB_ITEM&gt;</b> is expanded to the full path to the library for CMake targets, or the item itself exactly as
         specified in the <b>&lt;LIBRARY_EXPRESSION&gt;</b> otherwise.

       In addition to the above, it is possible to have one  pattern  for  paths  (CMake  targets  and  external
       libraries  specified with file paths) and another for other items specified by name only.  The <b>PATH{}</b> and
       <b>NAME{}</b> wrappers can be used to provide the expansion for those two cases,  respectively.   When  wrappers
       are used, both must be present.  For example:

          set(CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_weak_library
              "PATH{-weak_library &lt;LIBRARY&gt;}NAME{LINKER:-weak-l&lt;LIB_ITEM&gt;}"
          )

       For  all  three  elements  of  this  variable (<b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;LIBRARY_EXPRESSION&gt;</b>, and <b>&lt;SUFFIX&gt;</b>), the <b>LINKER:</b>
       prefix can be used.

       To pass options to the linker tool, each compiler driver has its own syntax.  The <b>LINKER:</b>  prefix  and  <b>,</b>
       separator  can  be  used  to  specify,  in a portable way, options to pass to the linker tool. <b>LINKER:</b> is
       replaced by the appropriate driver option and <b>,</b> by the appropriate driver separator.  The  driver  prefix
       and   driver   separator   are   given   by   the  values  of  the  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG</u>  and
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP</u> variables.

       For example, <b>"LINKER:-z,defs"</b> becomes <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>-z</b> <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>defs</b> for <b>Clang</b> and <b>-Wl,-z,defs</b> for <b>GNU</b> <b>GCC</b>.

       The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix can be specified as part of a <b>SHELL:</b> prefix expression.

       The <b>LINKER:</b> prefix supports, as an alternative syntax, specification of arguments using the <b>SHELL:</b> prefix
       and space as separator. The previous example then becomes <b>"LINKER:SHELL:-z</b> <b>defs"</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Specifying the <b>SHELL:</b> prefix anywhere other than at  the  beginning  of  the  <b>LINKER:</b>  prefix  is  not
          supported.

   <b>Examples</b>
   <b>Loading</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>static</b> <b>library</b>
       A  common  need  is  to  prevent the linker from discarding any symbols from a static library.  Different
       linkers use different syntax for achieving this.  The following example shows how this may be implemented
       for some linkers.  Note that this is for illustration purposes only.  Projects should  use  the  built-in
       <b>WHOLE_ARCHIVE</b>  feature  instead (see <u>Predefined</u> <u>Features</u>), which provides a more complete and more robust
       implementation of this functionality.

          set(CMAKE_C_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_load_archive_SUPPORTED TRUE)
          if(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "AppleClang")
            set(CMAKE_C_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_load_archive "-force_load &lt;LIB_ITEM&gt;")
          elseif(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "GNU" AND CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Linux")
            set(CMAKE_C_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_load_archive
              "LINKER:--push-state,--whole-archive"
              "&lt;LINK_ITEM&gt;"
              "LINKER:--pop-state"
            )
          elseif(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "MSVC")
            set(CMAKE_C_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_load_archive "/WHOLEARCHIVE:&lt;LIBRARY&gt;")
          else()
            # feature not yet supported for the other environments
            set(CMAKE_C_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_load_archive_SUPPORTED FALSE)
          endif()

          add_library(lib1 STATIC ...)
          add_library(lib2 SHARED ...)

          if(CMAKE_C_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_load_archive_SUPPORTED)
            # The -force_load Apple linker option requires a file name
            set(external_lib
              "$&lt;IF:$&lt;LINK_LANG_AND_ID:C,AppleClang&gt;,libexternal.a,external&gt;"
            )
            target_link_libraries(lib2 PRIVATE
              "$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:load_archive,lib1,${external_lib}&gt;"
            )
          else()
            target_link_libraries(lib2 PRIVATE lib1 external)
          endif()

       CMake will generate the following link expressions:

       • <b>AppleClang</b>: <b>-force_load</b> <b>/path/to/lib1.a</b> <b>-force_load</b> <b>libexternal.a</b>

       • <b>GNU</b>: <b>-Wl,--push-state,--whole-archive</b> <b>/path/to/lib1.a</b> <b>-lexternal</b> <b>-Wl,--pop-state</b>

       • <b>MSVC</b>: <b>/WHOLEARCHIVE:/path/to/lib1.lib</b> <b>/WHOLEARCHIVE:external.lib</b>

   <b>Linking</b> <b>a</b> <b>library</b> <b>as</b> <b>weak</b>
       On macOS, it is possible to link a library in weak mode (the library and all  references  are  marked  as
       weak  imports).   Different  flags  must  be  used  for  a library specified by file path compared to one
       specified by name.  This constraint can be solved using <b>PATH{}</b> and <b>NAME{}</b> wrappers.  Again, the following
       example shows how this may be implemented for some linkers, but it is  for  illustration  purposes  only.
       Projects  should  use  the  built-in  <b>WEAK_FRAMEWORK</b>  or  <b>WEAK_LIBRARY</b>  features  instead (see <u>Predefined</u>
       <u>Features</u>), which provide more complete and more robust implementations of this functionality.

          if (CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "AppleClang")
            set(CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_weak_library
                "PATH{-weak_library &lt;LIBRARY&gt;}NAME{LINKER:-weak-l&lt;LIB_ITEM&gt;}"
            )
            set(CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_weak_library_SUPPORTED TRUE)
          endif()

          add_library(lib SHARED ...)
          add_executable(main ...)
          if(CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_weak_library_SUPPORTED)
            target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE "$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:weak_library,lib,external&gt;")
          else()
            target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE lib external)
          endif()

       CMake will generate the following linker command line fragment when linking  <b>main</b>  using  the  <b>AppleClang</b>
       toolchain:

       <b>-weak_library</b> <b>/path/to/lib</b> <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>-weak-lexternal</b>.

   <b>Predefined</b> <b>Features</b>
       The following built-in library features are pre-defined by CMake:

       <b>DEFAULT</b>
              This  feature  corresponds to standard linking, essentially equivalent to using no feature at all.
              It is typically only  used  with  the  <u>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE</u>  and  <u>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE_&lt;LIBRARY&gt;</u>
              target properties.

       <b>WHOLE_ARCHIVE</b>
              Force  inclusion  of  all  members  of  a  static library.  This feature is only supported for the
              following platforms, with limitations as noted:

              • Linux.

              • All BSD variants.

              • SunOS.

              • All Apple variants.  The library must be specified as a CMake target name, a library  file  name
                (such  as <b>libfoo.a</b>), or a library file path (such as <b>/path/to/libfoo.a</b>).  Due to a limitation of
                the Apple linker, it cannot be specified as a plain library name like <b>foo</b>, where <b>foo</b>  is  not  a
                CMake target.

              • Windows.  When using a MSVC or MSVC-like toolchain, the MSVC version must be greater than 1900.

              • Cygwin.

              • MSYS.

       <b>FRAMEWORK</b>
              This  option  tells  the  linker to search for the specified framework using the <b>-framework</b> linker
              option.  It can only be used on Apple platforms, and only  with  a  linker  that  understands  the
              option used (i.e. the linker provided with Xcode, or one compatible with it).

              The framework can be specified as a CMake framework target, a bare framework name, or a file path.
              If a target is given, that target must have the <u>FRAMEWORK</u> target property set to true.  For a file
              path, if it contains a directory part, that directory will be added as a framework search path.

                 add_library(lib SHARED ...)
                 target_link_libraries(lib PRIVATE "$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:FRAMEWORK,/path/to/my_framework&gt;")

                 # The constructed linker command line will contain:
                 #   -F/path/to -framework my_framework

              File  paths must conform to one of the following patterns (<b>*</b> is a wildcard, and optional parts are
              shown as <b>[...]</b>):

                 • <b>[/path/to/]FwName[.framework]</b>

                 • <b>[/path/to/]FwName.framework/FwName[suffix]</b>

                 • <b>[/path/to/]FwName.framework/Versions/*/FwName[suffix]</b>

              Note that CMake recognizes and automatically handles framework targets,  even  without  using  the
              <u>$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:FRAMEWORK,...&gt;</u> expression.  The generator expression can still be used with a CMake
              target  if the project wants to be explicit about it, but it is not required to do so.  The linker
              command line may have some differences between using the generator  expression  or  not,  but  the
              final result should be the same.  On the other hand, if a file path is given, CMake will recognize
              some    paths   automatically,   but   not   all   cases.    The   project   may   want   to   use
              <u>$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:FRAMEWORK,...&gt;</u> for file paths so that the expected behavior is clear.

              Added in version 3.25: The <u>FRAMEWORK_MULTI_CONFIG_POSTFIX_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> target property as well as  the
              <b>suffix</b> of the framework library name are now supported by the <b>FRAMEWORK</b> features.

       <b>NEEDED_FRAMEWORK</b>
              This  is  similar to the <b>FRAMEWORK</b> feature, except it forces the linker to link with the framework
              even if no symbols are used from it.  It uses the <b>-needed_framework</b> option and has the same linker
              constraints as <b>FRAMEWORK</b>.

       <b>REEXPORT_FRAMEWORK</b>
              This is similar to the <b>FRAMEWORK</b> feature, except it tells the linker that the framework should  be
              available to clients linking to the library being created.  It uses the <b>-reexport_framework</b> option
              and has the same linker constraints as <b>FRAMEWORK</b>.

       <b>WEAK_FRAMEWORK</b>
              This  is  similar  to the <b>FRAMEWORK</b> feature, except it forces the linker to mark the framework and
              all references to it as weak imports.  It uses the <b>-weak_framework</b> option and has the same  linker
              constraints as <b>FRAMEWORK</b>.

       <b>NEEDED_LIBRARY</b>
              This  is  similar to the <b>NEEDED_FRAMEWORK</b> feature, except it is for use with non-framework targets
              or libraries (Apple  platforms  only).   It  uses  the  <b>-needed_library</b>  or  <b>-needed-l</b>  option  as
              appropriate, and has the same linker constraints as <b>NEEDED_FRAMEWORK</b>.

       <b>REEXPORT_LIBRARY</b>
              This  is  similar  to  the  <b>REEXPORT_FRAMEWORK</b>  feature,   except it is for use with non-framework
              targets or libraries (Apple platforms only).  It uses the <b>-reexport_library</b> or <b>-reexport-l</b>  option
              as appropriate, and has the same linker constraints as <b>REEXPORT_FRAMEWORK</b>.

       <b>WEAK_LIBRARY</b>
              This  is similar to the <b>WEAK_FRAMEWORK</b> feature, except it is for use with non-framework targets or
              libraries (Apple platforms only).  It uses the <b>-weak_library</b> or <b>-weak-l</b> option as appropriate, and
              has the same linker constraints as <b>WEAK_FRAMEWORK</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       Set to <b>TRUE</b> if the <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b>, as defined by  variable  <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u>,  is  supported
       regardless the linker language.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This       variable      is      evaluated      if,      and      only      if,      the      variable
          <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u> is not defined.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Default value for <u>LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE</u> target property.  This variable is used to initialize the property on
       each target as it is created.

   <b>CMAKE_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE_CHECK</b>
       Added in version 3.22.

       Defines the command executed after the link step to check libraries usage.  This check is currently  only
       defined on <b>ELF</b> platforms with value <b>ldd</b> <b>-u</b> <b>-r</b>.

       See also <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE_FLAG</u> variables.

   <b>CMAKE_LINKER_TYPE</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       Specify which linker will be used for the link step.

       This  variable  is  used  to  initialize  the  <u>LINKER_TYPE</u>  property  on each target created by a call to
       <u>add_library()</u> or <u>add_executable()</u>.  It is meaningful only for targets having a link step.   If  set,  its
       value is also used by the <u>try_compile()</u> command.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          It  is  assumed  that the linker specified is fully compatible with the default one the compiler would
          normally invoke. CMake will not do any option translation.

       Linker types are case-sensitive and may only contain  letters,  numbers  and  underscores.  Linker  types
       defined in all uppercase are reserved for CMake's own built-in types. The pre-defined linker types are:

       <b>DEFAULT</b>
              This  type  corresponds  to  standard  linking,  essentially  equivalent to the <u>LINKER_TYPE</u> target
              property not being set at all.

       <b>SYSTEM</b> Use the standard linker provided by the platform or  toolchain.  For  example,  this  implies  the
              Microsoft  linker  for  all  MSVC-compatible  compilers.  This type is supported for the following
              platform-compiler combinations:

              • Linux: <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b>, <b>LLVMFlang</b>, <b>NVIDIA</b>, and <b>Swift</b> compilers.

              • Apple platforms: <b>AppleClang</b>, <b>Clang</b>, <b>GNU</b>, and <b>Swift</b> compilers.

              • Windows: <b>MSVC</b>, <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b>, <b>NVIDIA</b>, and <b>Swift</b> compilers.

       <b>LLD</b>    Use the <b>LLVM</b> linker. This type is supported for the following platform-compiler combinations:

              • Linux: <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b>, <b>LLVMFlang</b>, <b>NVIDIA</b>, and <b>Swift</b> compilers.

              • Apple platforms: <b>Clang</b>, <b>AppleClang</b>, and <b>Swift</b> compilers.

              • Windows: <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b> with MSVC-like front-end, <b>Clang</b> with GNU-like front-end, <b>MSVC</b>,  <b>NVIDIA</b>  with
                MSVC-like front-end, and <b>Swift</b>.

       <b>BFD</b>    Use the <b>GNU</b> linker.  This type is supported for the following platform-compiler combinations:

              • Linux: <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b>, <b>LLVMFlang</b>, and <b>NVIDIA</b> compilers.

              • Windows: <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b> with GNU-like front-end.

       <b>GOLD</b>   Supported on Linux platform with <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b>, <b>LLVMFlang</b>, <b>NVIDIA</b>, and <b>Swift</b> compilers.

       <b>MOLD</b>   Use the <u>mold</u> <u>linker</u>. This type is supported on the following platform-compiler combinations:

              • Linux: <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b>, <b>LLVMFlang</b>, and <b>NVIDIA</b> compilers.

              • Apple platforms: <b>Clang</b> and <b>AppleClang</b> compilers (acts as an alias to the <u>sold</u> <u>linker</u>).

       <b>SOLD</b>   Use  the  <u>sold</u>  <u>linker</u>.  This  type is only supported on Apple platforms with <b>Clang</b> and <b>AppleClang</b>
              compilers.

       <b>APPLE_CLASSIC</b>
              Use the Apple linker in the classic  behavior  (i.e.  before  <b>Xcode</b>  <b>15.0</b>).   This  type  is  only
              supported on Apple platforms with <b>GNU</b>, <b>Clang</b>, <b>AppleClang</b>, and <b>Swift</b> compilers.

       <b>MSVC</b>   Use  the  Microsoft  linker.  This type is only supported on the Windows platform with <b>MSVC</b>, <b>Clang</b>
              with MSVC-like front-end, and <b>Swift</b> compilers.

   <b>CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE</b>
       Default value for <u>MACOSX_BUNDLE</u> of targets.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>MACOSX_BUNDLE</u> property on  all  the  targets.   See  that  target
       property for additional information.

       This variable is set to <b>ON</b> by default if <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u> equals to <u>iOS,</u> <u>tvOS,</u> <u>visionOS</u> <u>or</u> <u>watchOS</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH</b>
       Whether to use rpaths on macOS and iOS.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>MACOSX_RPATH</u> property on all targets.

   <b>CMAKE_MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Default value for <u>MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> of targets.

       This  variable  is  used to initialize the <u>MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> property on all the targets.  See
       that target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS</b>
       Linker flags to be used to create modules.

       These flags will be used by the linker when creating a module.

   <b>CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Flags to be used when linking a module.

       Same as <b>CMAKE_C_FLAGS_*</b> but used by the linker when creating modules.

   <b>CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_INIT</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Value used to initialize the <u>CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> cache entry the first time a  build  tree
       is  configured.   This  variable  is  meant  to  be set by a <u>toolchain</u> <u>file</u>.  CMake may prepend or append
       content to the value based on the environment and target platform.

       See also <u>CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Value used to initialize the <u>CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS</u> cache  entry  the  first  time  a  build  tree  is
       configured.   This  variable is meant to be set by a <u>toolchain</u> <u>file</u>.  CMake may prepend or append content
       to the value based on the environment and target platform.

       See also the configuration-specific variable <u>CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_INIT</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT</b>
       Added in version 3.25.

       Select the MSVC debug information format targeting the MSVC ABI.  This variable is used to initialize the
       <u>MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT</u> property on all targets as they are created.   It  is  also  propagated  by
       calls to the <u>try_compile()</u> command into the test project.

       The allowed values are:

       <b>Embedded</b>
              Compile  with  <b>-Z7</b>  or  equivalent  flag(s)  to  produce object files with full symbolic debugging
              information.

       <b>ProgramDatabase</b>
              Compile with <b>-Zi</b> or equivalent flag(s) to  produce  a  program  database  that  contains  all  the
              symbolic debugging information.

       <b>EditAndContinue</b>
              Compile  with  <b>-ZI</b>  or equivalent flag(s) to produce a program database that supports the Edit and
              Continue feature.

       The value is ignored on compilers not targeting the MSVC ABI, but an unsupported value will  be  rejected
       as an error when using a compiler targeting the MSVC ABI.

       The value may also be the empty string (<b>""</b>), in which case no debug information format flag will be added
       explicitly by CMake.

       Use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> to support per-configuration specification.  For example, the code:

          set(CMAKE_MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT "$&lt;$&lt;CONFIG:Debug,RelWithDebInfo&gt;:ProgramDatabase&gt;")

       selects  for  all  following  targets  the  program  database  debug  information  format  for  the Debug
       configuration.

       If this variable  is  not  set,  the  <u>MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT</u>  target  property  will  not  be  set
       automatically.   If  that property is not set, CMake selects a debug information format using the default
       value <b>$&lt;$&lt;CONFIG:Debug,RelWithDebInfo&gt;:ProgramDatabase&gt;</b>, if supported  by  the  compiler,  and  otherwise
       <b>$&lt;$&lt;CONFIG:Debug,RelWithDebInfo&gt;:Embedded&gt;</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This  variable  has  effect  only  when  policy  <u>CMP0141</u> is set to <b>NEW</b> prior to the first <u>project()</u> or
          <u>enable_language()</u> command that enables a language using a compiler targeting the MSVC ABI.

   <b>CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       Select the MSVC runtime library for use by compilers targeting the MSVC ABI.  This variable  is  used  to
       initialize  the  <u>MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</u> property on all targets as they are created.  It is also propagated
       by calls to the <u>try_compile()</u> command into the test project.

       The allowed values are:

       <b>MultiThreaded</b>
              Compile with <b>-MT</b> or equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded statically-linked runtime library.

       <b>MultiThreadedDLL</b>
              Compile with <b>-MD</b> or equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded dynamically-linked runtime library.

       <b>MultiThreadedDebug</b>
              Compile with <b>-MTd</b> or equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded statically-linked runtime library.

       <b>MultiThreadedDebugDLL</b>
              Compile with <b>-MDd</b> or  equivalent  flag(s)  to  use  a  multi-threaded  dynamically-linked  runtime
              library.

       The  value  is ignored on compilers not targeting the MSVC ABI, but an unsupported value will be rejected
       as an error when using a compiler targeting the MSVC ABI.

       The value may also be the empty string (<b>""</b>) in which case no runtime library selection flag will be added
       explicitly by CMake.  Note that with <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> the native build system may choose  to  add
       its own default runtime library selection flag.

       Use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> to support per-configuration specification.  For example, the code:

          set(CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY "MultiThreaded$&lt;$&lt;CONFIG:Debug&gt;:Debug&gt;")

       selects  for  all  following  targets  a multi-threaded statically-linked runtime library with or without
       debug information depending on the configuration.

       If this variable is not set then the <u>MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</u> target property will not be set  automatically.
       If that property is not set then CMake uses the default value <b>MultiThreaded$&lt;$&lt;CONFIG:Debug&gt;:Debug&gt;DLL</b> to
       select a MSVC runtime library.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This  variable  has  effect  only  when  policy  <u>CMP0091</u> is set to <b>NEW</b> prior to the first <u>project()</u> or
          <u>enable_language()</u> command that enables a language using a compiler targeting the MSVC ABI.

   <b>CMAKE_MSVCIDE_RUN_PATH</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       Extra PATH locations that should be used when executing <u>add_custom_command()</u> or <u>add_custom_target()</u>  when
       using  <u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>  <u>Generators</u>.   This  allows  for  running  commands  and  using  dll's that the IDE
       environment is not aware of.

       If not set explicitly the value is initialized by the  <b>CMAKE_MSVCIDE_RUN_PATH</b>  environment  variable,  if
       set, and otherwise left empty.

   <b>CMAKE_NINJA_OUTPUT_PATH_PREFIX</b>
       Added in version 3.6.

       Tell  the  <u>Ninja</u>  <u>Generators</u>  to  add  a prefix to every output path in <b>build.ninja</b>.  A trailing slash is
       appended to the prefix, if missing.

       This is useful when the generated ninja file is meant to be embedded as a  <b>subninja</b>  file  into  a  <u>super</u>
       ninja project.  For example, the command:

          cd super-build-dir &amp;&amp;
          cmake -G Ninja -S /path/to/src -B sub -DCMAKE_NINJA_OUTPUT_PATH_PREFIX=sub/
          #                                 ^^^---------- these match -----------^^^

       generates  a  build  directory with its top-level (<u>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</u>) in <b>super-build-dir/sub</b>.  The path to
       the  build  directory  ends  in  the  output  path  prefix.   This  makes  it  suitable  for  use  in   a
       separately-written <b>super-build-dir/build.ninja</b> file with a directive like this:

          subninja sub/build.ninja

       The  <b>auto-regeneration</b>  rule  in  <b>super-build-dir/build.ninja</b>  must  have  an  order-only  dependency  on
       <b>sub/build.ninja</b>.

       Added in version 3.27: The <u>Ninja</u> <u>Multi-Config</u> generator supports this variable.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          When <b>CMAKE_NINJA_OUTPUT_PATH_PREFIX</b> is set, the project  generated  by  CMake  cannot  be  used  as  a
          standalone project.  No default targets are specified.

          The  value  of  <b>CMAKE_NINJA_OUTPUT_PATH_PREFIX</b>  must  match  one or more path components at the <u>end</u> of
          <u>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</u>,  or  the  behavior  is  undefined.   However,  this  requirement  is   not   checked
          automatically.

   <b>CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH</b>
       Do not use the builtin binary editor to fix runtime library search paths on installation.

       When an ELF or XCOFF binary needs to have a different runtime library search path after installation than
       it does in the build tree, CMake uses a builtin editor to change the runtime search path in the installed
       copy.   If  this variable is set to true then CMake will relink the binary before installation instead of
       using its builtin editor.

       For more information on RPATH handling see the <u>INSTALL_RPATH</u> and <u>BUILD_RPATH</u> target properties.

       Added in version 3.20: This variable also applies to XCOFF binaries' LIBPATH.  Prior to the  addition  of
       the XCOFF editor in CMake 3.20, this variable applied only to ELF binaries' RPATH/RUNPATH.

   <b>CMAKE_NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED</b>
       Default value for <u>NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED</u> of targets.

       This  variable  is  used to initialize the <u>NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED</u> property on all the targets.  See that
       target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_OPTIMIZE_DEPENDENCIES</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       Initializes the <u>OPTIMIZE_DEPENDENCIES</u> target property.

   <b>CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES</b>
       Target specific architectures for macOS and iOS.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>OSX_ARCHITECTURES</u> property on each target as it is created.   See
       that target property for additional information.

       The  value  of  this  variable  should  be  set prior to the first <u>project()</u> or <u>enable_language()</u> command
       invocation because it may influence configuration of the toolchain and flags.  It is intended to  be  set
       locally  by  the user creating a build tree.  This variable should be set as a <b>CACHE</b> entry (or else CMake
       may remove it while initializing a cache entry of the same name) unless policy <u>CMP0126</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>.

       Despite the <b>OSX</b> part in the variable name(s) they apply also to other SDKs than  macOS  like  iOS,  tvOS,
       visionOS, or watchOS.

       This variable is ignored on platforms other than Apple.

   <b>CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</b>
       Specify  the  minimum version of the target platform (e.g. macOS or iOS) on which the target binaries are
       to be deployed.  CMake uses this variable value for the <b>-mmacosx-version-min</b>  flag  or  their  respective
       target  platform  equivalents.   For  older Xcode versions that shipped multiple macOS SDKs this variable
       also helps to choose the SDK in case <u>CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT</u> is unset.

       If not set explicitly the value is initialized by the <b>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</b> environment  variable,  if
       set, and otherwise computed based on the host platform.

       The  value  of  this  variable  should  be  set prior to the first <u>project()</u> or <u>enable_language()</u> command
       invocation because it may influence configuration of the toolchain and flags.  It is intended to  be  set
       locally  by  the user creating a build tree.  This variable should be set as a <b>CACHE</b> entry (or else CMake
       may remove it while initializing a cache entry of the same name) unless policy <u>CMP0126</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>.

       Despite the <b>OSX</b> part in the variable name(s) they apply also to other SDKs than  macOS  like  iOS,  tvOS,
       visionOS, or watchOS.

       This variable is ignored on platforms other than Apple.

   <b>CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT</b>
       Specify  the location or name of the macOS platform SDK to be used.  CMake uses this value to compute the
       value of the <b>-isysroot</b> flag or equivalent and to help the <b>find_*</b> commands locate files in the SDK.

       If not set explicitly the value is initialized by the <b>SDKROOT</b> environment variable, if set, and otherwise
       computed based on the <u>CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</u> or the host platform.

       The value of this variable should be set prior  to  the  first  <u>project()</u>  or  <u>enable_language()</u>  command
       invocation  because  it may influence configuration of the toolchain and flags.  It is intended to be set
       locally by the user creating a build tree.  This variable should be set as a <b>CACHE</b> entry (or  else  CMake
       may remove it while initializing a cache entry of the same name) unless policy <u>CMP0126</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>.

       Despite  the  <b>OSX</b>  part  in the variable name(s) they apply also to other SDKs than macOS like iOS, tvOS,
       visionOS, or watchOS.

       This variable is ignored on platforms other than Apple.

   <b>CMAKE_PCH_INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>PCH_INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES</u>  property  of  targets  when  they  are
       created.

   <b>CMAKE_PCH_WARN_INVALID</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>PCH_WARN_INVALID</u> property of targets when they are created.

   <b>CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</b>
       Output directory for MS debug symbol <b>.pdb</b> files generated by the linker for executable and shared library
       targets.

       This  variable  is  used  to  initialize  the <u>PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u> property on all the targets.  See that
       target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Per-configuration output directory for MS debug symbol <b>.pdb</b> files generated by the linker for  executable
       and shared library targets.

       This  is  a per-configuration version of <u>CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u>.  This variable is used to initialize
       the <u>PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> property on all the targets.  See that target property  for  additional
       information.

   <b>CMAKE_PLATFORM_NO_VERSIONED_SONAME</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       This  variable  is used to globally control whether the <u>VERSION</u> and <u>SOVERSION</u> target properties should be
       used for shared libraries.  When set to true, adding version information to each shared library target is
       disabled.

       By default this variable is set only on platforms where CMake knows it is needed.   On  other  platforms,
       the specified properties will be used for shared libraries.

   <b>CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</b>
       Default value for <u>POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</u> of targets.

       This  variable is used to initialize the <u>POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</u> property on all the targets.  See that
       target property for additional information.  If set, its value is also used by the <u>try_compile()</u> command.

   <b>CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</b>
       Where to put all the <u>RUNTIME</u> target files when built.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u> property on all the targets.   See  that
       target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.3.

       Where to put all the <u>RUNTIME</u> target files when built for a specific configuration.

       This  variable  is  used to initialize the <u>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> property on all the targets.
       See that target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_ENABLE_EXPORTS</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       Specify whether shared library generates an import file.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>ENABLE_EXPORTS</u> target property for shared  library  targets  when
       they are created by calls to the <u>add_library()</u> command.  See the property documentation for details.

   <b>CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS</b>
       Linker flags to be used to create shared libraries.

       These flags will be used by the linker when creating a shared library.

   <b>CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Flags to be used when linking a shared library.

       Same as <b>CMAKE_C_FLAGS_*</b> but used by the linker when creating shared libraries.

   <b>CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_INIT</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Value  used  to initialize the <u>CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> cache entry the first time a build tree
       is configured.  This variable is meant to be set by a  <u>toolchain</u>  <u>file</u>.   CMake  may  prepend  or  append
       content to the value based on the environment and target platform.

       See also <u>CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Value  used  to  initialize  the  <u>CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS</u>  cache  entry  the first time a build tree is
       configured.  This variable is meant to be set by a <u>toolchain</u> <u>file</u>.  CMake may prepend or  append  content
       to the value based on the environment and target platform.

       See also the configuration-specific variable <u>CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_INIT</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH</b>
       Do not include RPATHs in the build tree.

       Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building executables etc on systems that use RPATH.
       When  the  software is installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the install RPATH.  If
       this variable is set to <b>TRUE</b> then the software is always built with no RPATH.

       This is used to initialize the <u>SKIP_BUILD_RPATH</u> target property for all targets. For more information  on
       RPATH handling see the <u>INSTALL_RPATH</u> and <u>BUILD_RPATH</u> target properties.

       See  also  the <u>CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH</u> variable.  To omit RPATH in both the build and install steps, use
       <u>CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH</u> instead.

   <b>CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH</b>
       Do not include RPATHs in the install tree.

       Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building executables etc on systems that use RPATH.
       When the software is installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the install  RPATH.   If
       this  variable  is  set  to  true  then  the software is always installed without RPATH, even if RPATH is
       enabled when building.  This can be useful for example to allow running tests from  the  build  directory
       with RPATH enabled before the installation step.

       See  also  the  <u>CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH</u>  variable.  To omit RPATH in both the build and install steps, use
       <u>CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH</u> instead.

       For more information on RPATH handling see the <u>INSTALL_RPATH</u> and <u>BUILD_RPATH</u> target properties.

   <b>CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS</b>
       Flags to be used to create static libraries.  These flags will be passed to the archiver when creating  a
       static library.

       See also <u>CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Static libraries do not actually link.  They are essentially archives of object files.  The use of the
          name "linker" in the name of this variable is kept for compatibility.

   <b>CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Flags  to be used to create static libraries.  These flags will be passed to the archiver when creating a
       static library in the <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> configuration.

       See also <u>CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Static libraries do not actually link.  They are essentially archives of object files.  The use of the
          name "linker" in the name of this variable is kept for compatibility.

   <b>CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_INIT</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Value used to initialize the <u>CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> cache entry the first time a  build  tree
       is  configured.   This  variable  is  meant  to  be set by a <u>toolchain</u> <u>file</u>.  CMake may prepend or append
       content to the value based on the environment and target platform.

       See also <u>CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Value used to initialize the <u>CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS</u> cache  entry  the  first  time  a  build  tree  is
       configured.   This  variable is meant to be set by a <u>toolchain</u> <u>file</u>.  CMake may prepend or append content
       to the value based on the environment and target platform.

       See also the configuration-specific variable <u>CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_INIT</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_TASKING_TOOLSET</b>
       Added in version 3.25.

       Select the Tasking toolset which provides the compiler

       Architecture compilers are provided by different toolchains with incompatible  versioning  schemes.   Set
       this  variable  in a <u>toolchain</u> <u>file</u> so CMake can detect the compiler features correctly. If no toolset is
       specified, <b>Standalone</b> is assumed.

       Due to the different versioning schemes, the compiler version (<u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION</u>) depends  on
       the  toolset  and  architecture in use. If projects can be built with multiple toolsets or architectures,
       the       specified       <b>CMAKE_TASKING_TOOLSET</b>       and       the       automatically        determined
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ARCHITECTURE_ID</u>   must   be   taken   into   account  when  comparing  against  the
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION</u>.

       <b>TriCore</b>
              Compilers are provided by the TriCore toolset.

       <b>SmartCode</b>
              Compilers are provided by the SmartCode toolset.

       <b>Standalone</b>
              Compilers are provided by the standalone toolsets.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 For the TriCore architecture, the compiler from the TriCore toolset is selected  as  standalone
                 compiler.

   <b>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION</b>
       Build configuration used for <u>try_compile()</u> and <u>try_run()</u> projects.

       Projects  built  by  <u>try_compile()</u>  and  <u>try_run()</u> are built synchronously during the CMake configuration
       step.  Therefore a specific build configuration must  be  chosen  even  if  the  generated  build  system
       supports multiple configurations.

   <b>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_NO_PLATFORM_VARIABLES</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       Set  to  a  true value to tell the <u>try_compile()</u> command not to propagate any platform variables into the
       test project.

       The <u>try_compile()</u> command normally passes some CMake variables that configure the platform and  toolchain
       behavior into test projects.  See policy <u>CMP0137</u>.  This variable may be set to disable that behavior.

   <b>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES</b>
       Added in version 3.6.

       List  of  variables  that  the  <u>try_compile()</u>  command source file signature must propagate into the test
       project in order to target the same platform as the host project.

       This variable should not be set by project code.  It is meant to be set by CMake's  platform  information
       modules for the current toolchain, or by a toolchain file when used with <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u>.

       Variables   meaningful   to  CMake,  such  as  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u>,  are  propagated  automatically.   The
       <b>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES</b> variable may be  set  to  pass  custom  variables  meaningful  to  a
       toolchain file.  For example, a toolchain file may contain:

          set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME ...)
          set(CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES MY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE)
          # ... use MY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE ...

       If  a  user  passes <b>-DMY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE=SomeValue</b> to CMake then this setting will be made visible to the
       toolchain file both for the main project and for test projects generated  by  the  <u>try_compile()</u>  command
       source file signature.

       Changed  in  version  3.24:  Listed variables are propagated to the <u>try_compile()</u> <u>whole-project</u> signature
       too.  See <u>CMP0137</u>.

       Added in version 3.24: The <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_NO_PLATFORM_VARIABLES</u> variable may be set to disable passing
       platform variables into the test project.

   <b>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</b>
       Added in version 3.6.

       Type of target generated for <u>try_compile()</u> calls using the source file signature.  Valid values are:

       <b>EXECUTABLE</b>
              Use <u>add_executable()</u> to name the source file in the generated project.  This is the default if  no
              value is given.

       <b>STATIC_LIBRARY</b>
              Use  <u>add_library()</u>  with the <b>STATIC</b> option to name the source file in the generated project.  This
              avoids running the linker and is intended for use with cross-compiling toolchains that cannot link
              without custom flags or linker scripts.

   <b>CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>UNITY_BUILD</u> property of targets when they are  created.   Setting
       it  to true enables batch compilation of multiple sources within each target.  This feature is known as a
       <u>Unity</u> or <u>Jumbo</u> build.

       Projects should not set this variable, it is intended as a developer control to be set  on  the  <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u>
       command line or other equivalent methods.  The developer must have the ability to enable or disable unity
       builds according to the capabilities of their own machine and compiler.

       By default, this variable is not set, which will result in unity builds being disabled.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This  option  currently  does  not  work  well  in  combination with the <u>CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS</u>
          variable.

   <b>CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE</u> property of targets when they are created.
       It specifies the default upper limit on the number of source files that may be combined in any one  unity
       source file when unity builds are enabled for a target.

   <b>CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD_UNIQUE_ID</b>
       Added in version 3.20.

       This  variable is used to initialize the <u>UNITY_BUILD_UNIQUE_ID</u> property of targets when they are created.
       It specifies the name of the unique identifier generated per file in a unity build.

   <b>CMAKE_VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS</u> property of targets  when  they  are
       created.  Setting it to true enables header set verification.

       Projects  should  not  normally set this variable, it is intended as a developer control to be set on the
       <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u> command line or other equivalent methods.  The developer must have  the  ability  to  enable  or
       disable header set verification according to the capabilities of their own machine and compiler.

       Verification  of  a  dependency's  header  sets  is  not typically of interest to developers.  Therefore,
       <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> explicitly sets <b>CMAKE_VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS</b> to false for the duration
       of its call, but restores its original value before returning.  If a project brings a dependency directly
       into the main build (e.g. calling <u>add_subdirectory()</u> on a vendored project  from  a  git  submodule),  it
       should also do likewise.  For example:

          # Save original setting so we can restore it later
          set(want_header_set_verification ${CMAKE_VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS})

          # Include the vendored dependency with header set verification disabled
          set(CMAKE_VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS OFF)
          add_subdirectory(...)   # Vendored sources, e.g. from git submodules

          # Add the project's own sources. Restore the developer's original choice
          # for whether to enable header set verification.
          set(CMAKE_VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS ${want_header_set_verification})
          add_subdirectory(src)

       By default, this variable is not set, which will result in header set verification being disabled.

   <b>CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN</b>
       Default value for the <u>VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN</u> target property when a target is created.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_DEBUGGER_COMMAND</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       This  variable  is  used  to initialize the <u>VS_DEBUGGER_COMMAND</u> property on each target as it is created.
       See that target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_DEBUGGER_COMMAND_ARGUMENTS</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>VS_DEBUGGER_COMMAND_ARGUMENTS</u> property on each target  as  it  is
       created.  See that target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_DEBUGGER_ENVIRONMENT</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>VS_DEBUGGER_ENVIRONMENT</u> property on each target as it is created.
       See that target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_DEBUGGER_WORKING_DIRECTORY</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       This  variable  is  used to initialize the <u>VS_DEBUGGER_WORKING_DIRECTORY</u> property on each target as it is
       created.  See that target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_GLOBALS</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       List of  <b>Key=Value</b>  records  to  be  set  per  target  as  target  properties  <u>VS_GLOBAL_&lt;variable&gt;</u>  with
       <b>variable=Key</b> and value <b>Value</b>.

       For example:

          set(CMAKE_VS_GLOBALS
            "DefaultLanguage=en-US"
            "MinimumVisualStudioVersion=14.0"
            )

       will  set  properties <b>VS_GLOBAL_DefaultLanguage</b> to <b>en-US</b> and <b>VS_GLOBAL_MinimumVisualStudioVersion</b> to <b>14.0</b>
       for all targets (except for <b>INTERFACE</b> libraries).

       This variable is meant to be set by a <u>toolchain</u> <u>file</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_INCLUDE_INSTALL_TO_DEFAULT_BUILD</b>
       Added in version 3.3.

       Include <b>INSTALL</b> target to default build.

       In Visual Studio solution, by default the <b>INSTALL</b> target will not be part of the default  build.  Setting
       this variable will enable the <b>INSTALL</b> target to be part of the default build.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_INCLUDE_PACKAGE_TO_DEFAULT_BUILD</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Include <b>PACKAGE</b> target to default build.

       In  Visual  Studio solution, by default the <b>PACKAGE</b> target will not be part of the default build. Setting
       this variable will enable the <b>PACKAGE</b> target to be part of the default build.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_JUST_MY_CODE_DEBUGGING</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       Enable Just My Code with Visual Studio debugger.

       This variable is used to initialize the <u>VS_JUST_MY_CODE_DEBUGGING</u> property on all targets when  they  are
       created.  See that target property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_NO_COMPILE_BATCHING</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       Turn off compile batching when using <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>.

       This  variable  is  used  to  initialize the <u>VS_NO_COMPILE_BATCHING</u> property on all targets when they are
       created.  See that target property for additional information.

   <b>Example</b>
       This shows setting the property for the target <b>foo</b> using the variable.

          set(CMAKE_VS_NO_COMPILE_BATCHING ON)
          add_library(foo SHARED foo.cpp)

   <b>CMAKE_VS_SDK_EXCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       This variable allows to override Visual Studio default Exclude Directories.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_SDK_EXECUTABLE_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       This variable allows to override Visual Studio default Executable Directories.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_SDK_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       This variable allows to override Visual Studio default Include Directories.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_SDK_LIBRARY_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       This variable allows to override Visual Studio default Library Directories.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_SDK_LIBRARY_WINRT_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       This variable allows to override Visual Studio default Library WinRT Directories.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_SDK_REFERENCE_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       This variable allows to override Visual Studio default Reference Directories.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_SDK_SOURCE_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       This variable allows to override Visual Studio default Source Directories.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_WINRT_BY_DEFAULT</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       Inform <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> for VS 2010 and above that the target platform enables WinRT  compilation
       by  default and it needs to be explicitly disabled if <b>/ZW</b> or <u>VS_WINRT_COMPONENT</u> is omitted (as opposed to
       enabling it when either of those options is present)

       This makes cmake configuration consistent in terms of WinRT among platforms - if you did not  enable  the
       WinRT compilation explicitly, it will be disabled (by either not enabling it or explicitly disabling it)

       Note:  WinRT  compilation  is  always  explicitly  disabled  for  C  language source files, even if it is
       expliclty enabled for a project

       This variable is meant to be set by a <u>toolchain</u> <u>file</u> for such platforms.

   <b>CMAKE_WATCOM_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       Select the Watcom runtime library for use by compilers targeting the Watcom ABI.  This variable  is  used
       to  initialize  the  <u>WATCOM_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</u>  property  on  all  targets  as they are created.  It is also
       propagated by calls to the <u>try_compile()</u> command into the test project.

       The allowed values are:

       <b>SingleThreaded</b>
              Compile without additional flags to use a single-threaded statically-linked runtime library.

       <b>SingleThreadedDLL</b>
              Compile with <b>-br</b> or  equivalent  flag(s)  to  use  a  single-threaded  dynamically-linked  runtime
              library. This is not available for Linux targets.

       <b>MultiThreaded</b>
              Compile with <b>-bm</b> or equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded statically-linked runtime library.

       <b>MultiThreadedDLL</b>
              Compile  with  <b>-bm</b>  <b>-br</b>  or  equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded dynamically-linked runtime
              library. This is not available for Linux targets.

       The value is ignored on non-Watcom compilers but an unsupported value will be rejected as an  error  when
       using a compiler targeting the Watcom ABI.

       The value may also be the empty string (<b>""</b>) in which case no runtime library selection flag will be added
       explicitly by CMake.

       Use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> to support per-configuration specification.

       For example, the code:

          set(CMAKE_WATCOM_RUNTIME_LIBRARY "MultiThreaded")

       selects for all following targets a multi-threaded statically-linked runtime library.

       If  this  variable  is  not  set  then  the  <u>WATCOM_RUNTIME_LIBRARY</u>  target  property  will  not  be  set
       automatically.  If that property is not set then CMake uses the default value <b>MultiThreadedDLL</b> on Windows
       and <b>SingleThreaded</b> on other platforms to select a Watcom runtime library.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This variable has effect only when policy <u>CMP0136</u> is set to  <b>NEW</b>  prior  to  the  first  <u>project()</u>  or
          <u>enable_language()</u> command that enables a language using a compiler targeting the Watcom ABI.

   <b>CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE</b>
       Default value for <u>WIN32_EXECUTABLE</u> of targets.

       This  variable  is  used to initialize the <u>WIN32_EXECUTABLE</u> property on all the targets.  See that target
       property for additional information.

   <b>CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Default value for <u>WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS</u> target property.  This variable is used  to  initialize  the
       property on each target as it is created.

   <b>CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt;</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Set Xcode target attributes directly.

       Tell  the <u>Xcode</u> generator to set <b>&lt;an-attribute&gt;</b> to a given value in the generated Xcode project.  Ignored
       on other generators.

       This offers low-level control over the generated Xcode project file.  It is meant as a  last  resort  for
       specifying  settings  that  CMake does not otherwise have a way to control.  Although this can override a
       setting CMake normally produces on its own, doing so bypasses CMake's model of the project and can  break
       things.

       See the <u>XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt;</u> target property to set attributes on a specific target.

       Contents  of <b>CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt;</b> may use "generator expressions" with the syntax <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.
       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html">cmake-generator-expressions</a>(7)</u> manual for available expressions.   See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u>
       manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

   <b>EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH</b>
       Old executable location variable.

       The  target  property  <u>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u>  supersedes  this  variable  for  a  target if it is set.
       Executable targets are otherwise placed in this directory.

   <b>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH</b>
       Old library location variable.

       The target properties <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u>,  <u>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u>,  and  <u>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u>
       supersede  this  variable  for  a  target  if they are set.  Library targets are otherwise placed in this
       directory.

       variable.

   <b>Usage</b>
       This variable can be set by the user during the first time a build tree is configured.

       If a non-full path value is supplied then CMake will resolve the full path of the compiler.

       The variable could be set in a user supplied toolchain file or via <u>-D</u> on the command line.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Options that are required to make the compiler work correctly can be included as items in a list; they
          can not be changed.

          #set within user supplied toolchain file
          set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER /full/path/to/qcc --arg1 --arg2)

       This variable is not guaranteed to be defined for all compilers or languages.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LOADED</b>
       Defined to true if the language is enabled.

       When language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> is enabled by <u>project()</u> or <u>enable_language()</u> this variable is defined to <b>1</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_PREDEFINES_COMMAND</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       Command that outputs the compiler pre definitions.

       See <u>AUTOMOC</u> which uses <u>CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_PREDEFINES_COMMAND</u> to generate the <u>AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_TARGET</b>
       The target for cross-compiling, if supported.

       Some  compiler  drivers are inherently cross-compilers, such as clang and QNX qcc. These compiler drivers
       support a command-line argument to specify the target to cross-compile for.

       This variable may only be set in a toolchain file specified by the <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION</b>
       Compiler version string.

       Compiler version in major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]] format.  This variable is not guaranteed to be  defined
       for all compilers or languages.

       For  example  <b>CMAKE_C_COMPILER_VERSION</b> and <b>CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_VERSION</b> might indicate the respective C and
       C++ compiler version.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY</b>
       Rule variable to create a shared library.

       This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a shared library for the  language  <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.   This
       rule variable is a <b>;</b> delimited list of commands to run to perform the linking step.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHIVE</b>
       Added in version 3.31.

       Rule variable to create a shared library with archive.

       This  is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a shared library with an archive for the language
       &lt;LANG&gt;.  This rule variable is a ; delimited list of commands to run to perform the linking step.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CREATE_SHARED_MODULE</b>
       Rule variable to create a shared module.

       This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a shared library for the  language  <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.   This
       rule variable is a <b>;</b> delimited list of commands to run.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CREATE_STATIC_LIBRARY</b>
       Rule variable to create a static library.

       This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a static library for the language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_EXTENSIONS</b>
       The variations are:

       • <u>CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_CUDA_EXTENSIONS</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_HIP_EXTENSIONS</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_OBJC_EXTENSIONS</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_OBJCXX_EXTENSIONS</u>

       Default  values  for  <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_EXTENSIONS</u>  target  properties  if  set  when  a target is created.  For the
       compiler's default setting see <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT</u>.

       For supported CMake versions see the respective pages.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u> manual for information on compile features  and  a  list  of  supported
       compilers.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT</b>
       Added in version 3.22.

       Compiler's  default  extensions  mode. Used as the default for the <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_EXTENSIONS</u> target property when
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_EXTENSIONS</u> is not set (see <u>CMP0128</u>).

       This variable is read-only.  Modifying it is undefined behavior.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</b>
       Language-wide flags for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> used when building for all configurations.  These flags  will  be
       passed to all invocations of the compiler.  This includes invocations that drive compiling and those that
       drive linking.

       For  each  language,  if  this  variable  is not defined, it is initialized and stored in the cache using
       values from environment variables in combination with CMake's builtin defaults for the toolchain:

       • <b>CMAKE_C_FLAGS</b>: Initialized by the <u>CFLAGS</u> environment variable.

       • <b>CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS</b>: Initialized by the <u>CXXFLAGS</u> environment variable.

       • <b>CMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS</b>: Initialized by the <u>CUDAFLAGS</u> environment variable.

       • <b>CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS</b>: Initialized by the <u>FFLAGS</u> environment variable.

       • <b>CMAKE_CSharp_FLAGS</b>: Initialized by the <u>CSFLAGS</u> environment variable.

       • <b>CMAKE_HIP_FLAGS</b>: Initialized by the <u>HIPFLAGS</u> environment variable.

       • <b>CMAKE_ISPC_FLAGS</b>: Initialized by the <u>ISPCFLAGS</u> environment variable.

       • <b>CMAKE_OBJC_FLAGS</b>: Initialized by the <u>OBJCFLAGS</u> environment variable.

       • <b>CMAKE_OBJCXX_FLAGS</b>: Initialized by the <u>OBJCXXFLAGS</u> environment variable.

       This value is a command-line string fragment. Therefore, multiple options should be separated by  spaces,
       and options with spaces should be quoted.

       The    flags    in   this   variable   will   be   passed   before   those   in   the   per-configuration
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> variable.  On invocations driving compiling, flags from both  variables  will
       be  passed  before flags added by commands such as <u>add_compile_options()</u> and <u>target_compile_options()</u>. On
       invocations  driving  linking,  they  will  be  passed  before  flags   added   by   commands   such   as
       <u>add_link_options()</u> and <u>target_link_options()</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
       Language-wide  flags  for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> used when building for the <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> configuration.  These flags
       will be passed to all invocations of the compiler in  the  corresponding  configuration.   This  includes
       invocations that drive compiling and those that drive linking.

       The flags in this variable will be passed after those in the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u> variable.  On invocations
       driving  compiling,  flags  from  both  variables  will  be passed before flags added by commands such as
       <u>add_compile_options()</u> and <u>target_compile_options()</u>.  On invocations driving linking, they will be  passed
       before flags added by commands such as <u>add_link_options()</u> and <u>target_link_options()</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_INIT</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       Value  used  to  initialize  the  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>  cache entry the first time a build tree is
       configured for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.  This variable is meant to be set by a <u>toolchain</u> <u>file</u>.  CMake may prepend
       or append content to the value based on the environment and target platform.

       See also <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_INIT</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_DEBUG</b>
       This variable is the <b>Debug</b> variant of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_DEBUG_INIT</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       This variable is the <b>Debug</b> variant of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_INIT</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_INIT</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Value used to initialize the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u> cache entry the first time a build tree is configured for
       language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.  This variable is meant to be set by a <u>toolchain</u> <u>file</u>.   CMake  may  prepend  or  append
       content  to  the  value  based  on  the  environment and target platform.  For example, the contents of a
       <b>xxxFLAGS</b> environment variable will be prepended, where <b>xxx</b> will be language-specific but not  necessarily
       the  same as <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> (e.g. <u>CXXFLAGS</u> for <b>CXX</b>, <u>FFLAGS</u> for <b>Fortran</b>, and so on).  This value is a command-line
       string fragment. Therefore, multiple options should be separated  by  spaces,  and  options  with  spaces
       should be quoted.

       See also the configuration-specific <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_INIT</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_MINSIZEREL</b>
       This variable is the <b>MinSizeRel</b> variant of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_MINSIZEREL_INIT</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       This variable is the <b>MinSizeRel</b> variant of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_INIT</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_RELEASE</b>
       This variable is the <b>Release</b> variant of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_RELEASE_INIT</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       This variable is the <b>Release</b> variant of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_INIT</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO</b>
       This variable is the <b>RelWithDebInfo</b> variant of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO_INIT</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       This variable is the <b>RelWithDebInfo</b> variant of the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_INIT</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER</b>
       Added in version 3.10: <b>CMAKE_CUDA_HOST_COMPILER</b>

       Added in version 3.28: <b>CMAKE_HIP_HOST_COMPILER</b>

       This variable is available when <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> is <b>CUDA</b> or <b>HIP</b>.

       When  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ID</u>  is  <b>NVIDIA</b>, <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER</b> selects the compiler executable to
       use when compiling host code for <b>CUDA</b> or <b>HIP</b> language files.  This maps to the <b>nvcc</b> <b>-ccbin</b> option.

       The <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER</b> variable may be set explicitly before CUDA or HIP is first  enabled  by  a
       <u>project()</u>  or  <u>enable_language()</u>  command.   This can be done via <b>-DCMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER=...</b> on the
       command line or in a <u>toolchain</u> <u>file</u>.  Or, one may set the <u>CUDAHOSTCXX</u> or <u>HIPHOSTCXX</u> environment  variable
       to provide a default value.

       Once  the  CUDA  or  HIP  language  is  enabled, the <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER</b> variable is read-only and
       changes to it are undefined behavior.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Since <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER</b> is meaningful only when the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ID</u>  is  <b>NVIDIA</b>,  it
          does  not  make  sense to set <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER</b> without also setting <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER</b> to
          NVCC.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Projects should not try to set <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER</b> to match <u>CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER</u> themselves.   It
          is  the  end-user's responsibility, not the project's, to ensure that NVCC targets the same ABI as the
          C++ compiler.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Ignored when using <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>.

       See the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER_ID</u> and <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER_VERSION</u>  variables  for  information
       about the host compiler used by <b>nvcc</b>, whether by default or specified by <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER_ID</b>
       Added in version 3.31.

       This  variable  is  available  when  <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>  is  <b>CUDA</b>  or <b>HIP</b> and <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ID</u> is <b>NVIDIA</b>.  It
       contains the identity of the host compiler invoked  by  <b>nvcc</b>,  either  by  default  or  as  specified  by
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER</u>, among possibilities documented by <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ID</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.31.

       This  variable  is  available  when  <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>  is  <b>CUDA</b>  or <b>HIP</b> and <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ID</u> is <b>NVIDIA</b>.  It
       contains the version of the host compiler  invoked  by  <b>nvcc</b>,  either  by  default  or  as  specified  by
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER</u>, in the same format as <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IGNORE_EXTENSIONS</b>
       File extensions that should be ignored by the build.

       This  is  a  list  of  file  extensions  that  may  be part of a project for a given language but are not
       compiled.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header files.

       CMake does not explicitly specify these directories on compiler command lines for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.   This
       prevents  system  include  directories  from being treated as user include directories on some compilers,
       which is important for <b>C</b>, <b>CXX</b>, and <b>CUDA</b> to avoid overriding standard library headers.

       This value is not used for <b>Fortran</b> because it has no standard library headers and some compilers  do  not
       search their implicit include directories for module <b>.mod</b> files.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Implicit linker search path detected for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

       Compilers  typically  pass  directories  containing language runtime libraries and default library search
       paths when they invoke a linker.  These paths are implicit linker search directories for  the  compiler's
       language.

       For  each  language  enabled  by  the <u>project()</u> or <u>enable_language()</u> command, CMake automatically detects
       these     directories     and     reports     the      results      in      this      variable.       The
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES_EXCLUDE</u>  environment  variable  may  be  set  to  exclude specific
       directories from the automatically detected results.

       When linking to a static library, CMake adds the implicit link directories from this  variable  for  each
       language  used  in  the static library (except the language whose compiler is used to drive linking).  In
       the case of an imported static library, the <u>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES</u> target property  lists  the
       languages  whose  implicit link information is needed.  If any of the languages is not enabled, its value
       for the <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b> variable may instead be provided by the  project.   Or,  a
       <u>toolchain</u>  <u>file</u>  may  set  the  variable to a value known for the specified toolchain.  It will either be
       overridden when the language is enabled, or used as a fallback.

       Some toolchains read implicit directories from an environment variable such as  <b>LIBRARY_PATH</b>.   If  using
       such  an  environment  variable,  keep  its value consistent when operating in a given build tree because
       CMake saves the value detected when first creating a build tree.

       If policy <u>CMP0060</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b>, then when a library in one of these directories  is  given  by  full
       path  to  <u>target_link_libraries()</u>  CMake  will  generate  the  <b>-l&lt;name&gt;</b> form on link lines for historical
       purposes.

       See also the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_FRAMEWORK_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Implicit linker framework search path detected for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

       These paths are implicit  linker  framework  search  directories  for  the  compiler's  language.   CMake
       automatically detects these directories for each language and reports the results in this variable.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES</b>
       Implicit link libraries and flags detected for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

       Compilers typically pass language runtime library names and other flags when they invoke a linker.  These
       flags  are implicit link options for the compiler's language.  For each language enabled by the <u>project()</u>
       or <u>enable_language()</u> command, CMake automatically detects these  libraries  and  flags  and  reports  the
       results in this variable.

       When linking to a static library, CMake adds the implicit link libraries and flags from this variable for
       each  language  used in the static library (except the language whose compiler is used to drive linking).
       In the case of an imported static library, the <u>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES</u>  target  property  lists
       the  languages  whose  implicit  link information is needed.  If any of the languages is not enabled, its
       value for the <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES</b> variable may instead be provided by the project.   Or,
       a  <u>toolchain</u>  <u>file</u>  may set the variable to a value known for the specified toolchain.  It will either be
       overridden when the language is enabled, or used as a fallback.

       See also the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE</b>
       Target architecture library directory name detected for <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

       If the <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> compiler passes to the linker an architecture-specific system library search directory such
       as <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/lib/">/lib/</a>&lt;arch&gt;</b> this variable contains the <b>&lt;arch&gt;</b> name if/as detected by CMake.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_EXECUTABLE</b>
       Rule variable to link an executable.

       Rule variable to link an executable for the given language.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       Defines the syntax of compiler driver option to pass options to the linker  tool.  It  will  be  used  to
       translate the <b>LINKER:</b> prefix in the link options (see <u>add_link_options()</u> and <u>target_link_options()</u>).

       This  variable  holds  a  <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of tokens.  If a space (i.e. " ") is specified as last
       token, flag and <b>LINKER:</b> arguments will be specified as separate arguments to the  compiler  driver.   The
       <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP</u> variable can be specified to manage concatenation of arguments.

       For example, for <b>Clang</b> we have:

          set (CMAKE_C_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG "-Xlinker" " ")

       Specifying <b>"LINKER:-z,defs"</b> will be transformed in <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>-z</b> <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>defs</b>.

       For <b>GNU</b> <b>GCC</b>:

          set (CMAKE_C_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG "-Wl,")
          set (CMAKE_C_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP ",")

       Specifying <b>"LINKER:-z,defs"</b> will be transformed in <b>-Wl,-z,defs</b>.

       And for <b>SunPro</b>:

          set (CMAKE_C_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG "-Qoption" "ld" " ")
          set (CMAKE_C_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP ",")

       Specifying <b>"LINKER:-z,defs"</b> will be transformed in <b>-Qoption</b> <b>ld</b> <b>-z,defs</b>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       This variable is used with <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG</u> variable to format <b>LINKER:</b> prefix in the link
       options (see <u>add_link_options()</u> and <u>target_link_options()</u>).

       When specified, arguments of the <b>LINKER:</b> prefix will be concatenated using this value as separator.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_OUTPUT_EXTENSION</b>
       Extension for the output of a compile for a single file.

       This is the extension for an object file for the given <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.  For example <b>.obj</b> for C on Windows.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SIMULATE_ID</b>
       Identification string of the "simulated" compiler.

       Some  compilers  simulate  other  compilers  to serve as drop-in replacements.  When CMake detects such a
       compiler it sets this variable to what would have been the  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ID</u>  for  the  simulated
       compiler.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          In other words, this variable describes the ABI compatibility of the generated code.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SIMULATE_VERSION</b>
       Version string of "simulated" compiler.

       Some  compilers  simulate  other  compilers  to serve as drop-in replacements.  When CMake detects such a
       compiler it sets this variable  to  what  would  have  been  the  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION</u>  for  the
       simulated compiler.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SIZEOF_DATA_PTR</b>
       Size of pointer-to-data types for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.

       This  holds  the  size (in bytes) of pointer-to-data types in the target platform ABI.  It is defined for
       languages <b>C</b> and <b>CXX</b> (C++).

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS</b>
       Extensions of source files for the given language.

       This is the list of extensions for a given language's source files.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</b>
       The variations are:

       • <u>CMAKE_C_STANDARD</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_HIP_STANDARD</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_OBJC_STANDARD</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_OBJCXX_STANDARD</u>

       Default values for <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</u> target properties if set when a target is created.

       For supported CMake versions see the respective pages.

       See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u> manual for information on compile features  and  a  list  of  supported
       compilers.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_DEFAULT</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       The  compiler's  default  standard  for  the  language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>. Empty if the compiler has no conception of
       standard levels.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.6.

       Include directories to be used for every source file compiled with the <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> compiler.   This  is  meant
       for  specification  of  system  include directories needed by the language for the current platform.  The
       directories always appear at the end of the include path passed to the compiler.

       This variable should not be set by project code.  It is meant to be set by CMake's  platform  information
       modules for the current toolchain, or by a toolchain file when used with <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u>.

       See also <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_LIBRARIES</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_LATEST</b>
       Added in version 3.30.

       This variable represents the minimum between the latest version of the standard for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> which
       is  supported  by the current compiler and the latest version which is supported by CMake. Its value will
       be set to one of the supported values of the  corresponding  <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</u>  target  property;  see  the
       documentation of that property for a list of supported languages.

       See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  information on compile features and a list of supported
       compilers.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_LATEST</b> will never be set to a  language  standard  which  CMake  recognizes  but
          provides  no  support  for.  Unless explicitly stated otherwise, every value which is supported by the
          corresponding <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD</u> target property represents a standard of language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> which  is  both
          recognized and supported by CMake.

   <b>Checking</b> <b>for</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Support</b>
       It  is  possible  to  use  the  value  of the <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_LATEST</b> variable to check for language
       standard support. This can be used to, e.g., conditionally enable optional  features  for  a  distributed
       library.

       When  doing  so,  one should be careful to <b>not</b> rely on integer value comparisons between standard levels.
       This is because some older standards of a given language which  are  supported  by  CMake  (e.g.,  C++98,
       represented as <b>98</b>) will have a higher numerical value than newer standards of that same language.

       The following code sample demonstrates how one might correctly check for C++17 support:

          # Careful! We cannot do direct integer comparisons with
          # CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LATEST because some earlier C++ standards (e.g.,
          # C++98) will have a higher numerical value than our requirement (C++17).
          #
          # Instead, we keep a list of unsupported C++ standards and check if
          # CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LATEST appears in that list.
          set(UNSUPPORTED_CXX_STANDARDS
            98
            11
            14
          )

          list(FIND UNSUPPORTED_CXX_STANDARDS ${CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LATEST} UNSUPPORTED_CXX_STANDARDS_INDEX)

          if(UNSUPPORTED_CXX_STANDARDS_INDEX EQUAL -1)
            # We know that the current compiler supports at least C++17. Enabling
            # some optional feature...
          else()
            message(STATUS
              "Feature X is disabled because it requires C++17, but the current "
              "compiler only supports C++${CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LATEST}."
            )
          endif()

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_LIBRARIES</b>
       Added in version 3.6.

       Libraries  linked into every executable and shared library linked for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.  This is meant for
       specification of system libraries needed by the language for the current platform.

       This variable should not be set by project code.  It is meant to be set by CMake's  platform  information
       modules for the current toolchain, or by a toolchain file when used with <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u>.

       See also <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
       Added in version 3.31.

       Link  directories  specified  for every executable and library linked for language <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>.  This is meant
       for specification of system link directories needed by the language for the current platform.

       This variable should not be set by project code.  It is meant to be set by CMake's  platform  information
       modules for the current toolchain, or by a toolchain file when used with <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u>.

       See also <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_LIBRARIES</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_REQUIRED</b>
       The variations are:

       • <u>CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_HIP_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_OBJC_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_OBJCXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u>

       Default values for <u>&lt;LANG&gt;_STANDARD_REQUIRED</u> target properties if set when a target is created.

       For supported CMake versions see the respective pages.

       See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u>  manual  for  information on compile features and a list of supported

       compilers.

   <b>CMAKE_Swift_LANGUAGE_VERSION</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Set to the Swift language version number.  If not set, the oldest legacy version known to be available in
       the host Xcode version is assumed:

       • Swift <b>4.0</b> for Xcode 10.2 and above.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CTEST</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Specify the CTest <b>BuildDirectory</b> setting in a <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> dashboard client script.

   <b>CTEST_BUILD_COMMAND</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Specify the CTest <b>MakeCommand</b> setting in a <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> dashboard client script.

   <b>CTEST_BUILD_NAME</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Specify the CTest <b>BuildName</b> setting in a <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> dashboard client script.

   <b>CTEST_BZR_COMMAND</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Specify the CTest <b>BZRCommand</b> setting in a <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> dashboard client script.

   <b>CTEST_BZR_UPDATE_OPTIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Specify the CTest <b>BZRUpdateOptions</b> setting in a <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> dashboard client script.

   <b>CTEST_CHANGE_ID</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Specify the CTest <b>ChangeId</b> setting in a <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> dashboard client script.

       This  setting  allows  CTest to pass arbitrary information about this build up to CDash.  One use of this
       feature is to allow CDash to post comments on your pull request if anything goes wrong with your build.

   <b>CTEST_CHECKOUT_COMMAND</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Tell the <u>ctest_start()</u> command how to checkout or initialize the source directory in a <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> dashboard
       client script.

   <b>CTEST_CONFIGURATION_TYPE</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Specify the CTest <b>DefaultCTestConfigurationType</b> setting in a <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> dashboard client script.

       If the configuration type is set via <u>-C</u> <u>&lt;cfg&gt;</u> from the command  line  then  this  variable  is  populated
       accordingly.

   <b>CTEST_CONFIGURE_COMMAND</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Specify the CTest <b>ConfigureCommand</b> setting in a <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> dashboard client script.

   <b>CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Specify the CTest <b>CoverageCommand</b> setting in a <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> dashboard client script.

   <b>Cobertura</b>
       Using <u>Cobertura</u> as the coverage generation within your multi-module Java project can generate a series of
       XML files.

       The Cobertura Coverage parser expects to read the coverage data from a single XML file which contains the
       coverage  data  for  all  modules.  Cobertura has a program with the ability to merge given <b>cobertura.ser</b>
       files and then another program to generate a combined XML  file  from  the  previous  merged  file.   For
       command  line testing, this can be done by hand prior to CTest looking for the coverage files. For script
       builds, set the <b>CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND</b> variable to point to a file which will perform these  same  steps,
       such as a <b>.sh</b> or <b>.bat</b> file.

          set(CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND .../run-coverage-and-consolidate.sh)

       where  the  <b>run-coverage-and-consolidate.sh</b> script is perhaps created by the <u>configure_file()</u> command and
       might contain the following code:

          #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?env">/usr/bin/env</a> bash
          CoberturaFiles="$(find "/path/to/source" -name "cobertura.ser")"
          SourceDirs="$(find "/path/to/source" -name "java" -type d)"
          cobertura-merge --datafile coberturamerge.ser $CoberturaFiles
          cobertura-report --datafile coberturamerge.ser --destination . \
                           --format xml $SourceDirs

       The script uses <b>find</b> to capture the paths to all of the <b>cobertura.ser</b> files  found  below  the  project's
       source  directory.   It  keeps  the  list  of files and supplies it as an argument to the <b>cobertura-merge</b>
       program. The <b>--datafile</b> argument signifies where the result of the merge will be kept.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CPACK</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CPACK_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES</b>
       List of files which have been installed using an <b>ABSOLUTE</b> <b>DESTINATION</b> path.

       This  variable  is  a  Read-Only variable which is set internally by CPack during installation and before
       packaging using <u>CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES</u> defined in <b>cmake_install.cmake</b> scripts.  The  value  can
       be used within CPack project configuration file and/or <b>CPack&lt;GEN&gt;.cmake</b> file of <b>&lt;GEN&gt;</b> generator.

   <b>CPACK_COMPONENT_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY</b>
       Boolean toggle to include/exclude top level directory (component case).

       Similar    usage    as    <u>CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY</u>    but    for   the   component   case.    See
       <u>CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY</u> documentation for the detail.

   <b>CPACK_CUSTOM_INSTALL_VARIABLES</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       CPack variables (set via e.g. <u>cpack</u> <u>-D</u>, <b>CPackConfig.cmake</b> or <u>CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE</u> scripts)  are  not
       directly  visible  in  installation  scripts.  Instead, one can pass a list of <b>varName=value</b> pairs in the
       <b>CPACK_CUSTOM_INSTALL_VARIABLES</b> variable.  At install time, each list item will result in  a  variable  of
       the specified name (<b>varName</b>) being set to the given <b>value</b>.  The <b>=</b> can be omitted for an empty <b>value</b>.

       <b>CPACK_CUSTOM_INSTALL_VARIABLES</b>  allows the packaging installation to be influenced by the user or driving
       script at CPack runtime without having to regenerate the install scripts.

   <b>Example</b>
          install(FILES large.txt DESTINATION data)

          install(CODE [[

              # large.txt.xz from large.txt and then removes the input file
              execute_process(COMMAND run-compressor $ENV{DESTDIR}${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/large.txt)
            endif()
          ]])

       With the above example snippet, <u>cpack</u> will by default run the installation script with <b>ENABLE_COMPRESSION</b>
       unset, resulting in a package containing  the  uncompressed  <b>large.txt</b>.   This  can  be  overridden  when
       invoking <u>cpack</u> like so:

          cpack -D "CPACK_CUSTOM_INSTALL_VARIABLES=ENABLE_COMPRESSION=TRUE"

       The  installation  script  will  then  run  with  <b>ENABLE_COMPRESSION</b>  set to <b>TRUE</b>, resulting in a package
       containing the compressed <b>large.txt.xz</b> instead.

   <b>CPACK_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION</b>
       Ask CPack to error out as soon as a file with absolute <b>INSTALL</b> <b>DESTINATION</b> is encountered.

       The fatal error is emitted before the installation  of  the  offending  file  takes  place.   Some  CPack
       generators,   like   <b>NSIS</b>,   enforce   this   internally.   This  variable  triggers  the  definition  of
       <u>CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION</u> when CPack runs.

   <b>CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY</b>
       Boolean toggle to include/exclude top level directory.

       When preparing a package CPack installs the item under the so-called top level directory.  The purpose of
       is to include (set to <b>1</b> or <b>ON</b> or <b>TRUE</b>) the top level directory in the package or not (set to <b>0</b> or <b>OFF</b>  or
       <b>FALSE</b>).

       Each CPack generator has a built-in default value for this variable.  E.g.  Archive generators (ZIP, TGZ,
       ...) includes the top level whereas RPM or DEB don't.  The user may override the default value by setting
       this variable.

       There  is a similar variable <u>CPACK_COMPONENT_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY</u> which may be used to override the
       behavior for the component packaging case which may have different  default  value  for  historical  (now
       backward compatibility) reason.

   <b>CPACK_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       Default permissions for implicitly created directories during packaging.

       This variable serves the same purpose during packaging as the <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS</u>
       variable serves during installation (e.g. <b>make</b> <b>install</b>).

       If   <u>include(CPack)</u>   is   used   then   by   default   this   variable   is   set   to  the  content  of
       <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS</u>.

   <b>CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX</b>
       The prefix used in the built package.

       Each CPack generator has a default value (like <b><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b>).  This default value may  be  overwritten  from  the
       <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> or the <u><a href="../man1/cpack.1.html">cpack</a>(1)</u> command line by setting an alternative value.  Example:

          set(CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX "<a href="file:/opt">/opt</a>")

       This  is  not  the same purpose as <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> which is used when installing from the build tree
       without building a package.

   <b>CPACK_SET_DESTDIR</b>
       Boolean toggle to make CPack use <b>DESTDIR</b> mechanism when packaging.

       <b>DESTDIR</b> means DESTination DIRectory.  It is commonly used by makefile users in order to install  software
       at  non-default  location.   It  is  a basic relocation mechanism that should not be used on Windows (see
       <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> documentation).  It is usually invoked like this:

          make DESTDIR=/home/john install

       which will install the concerned software using the installation prefix, e.g. <b><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></b>  prepended  with
       the  <b>DESTDIR</b>  value  which  finally  gives  <b>/home/john/usr/local</b>.   When preparing a package, CPack first
       installs the items to be packaged in a local (to the build tree) directory  by  using  the  same  <b>DESTDIR</b>
       mechanism.   Nevertheless, if <b>CPACK_SET_DESTDIR</b> is set then CPack will set <b>DESTDIR</b> before doing the local
       install.   The   most   noticeable   difference   is   that   without   <b>CPACK_SET_DESTDIR</b>,   CPack   uses
       <u>CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>   as   a  prefix  whereas  with  <b>CPACK_SET_DESTDIR</b>  set,  CPack  will  use
       <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> as a prefix.

       Manually setting <b>CPACK_SET_DESTDIR</b> may help (or simply be necessary) if some install rules uses  absolute
       <b>DESTINATION</b>  (see  CMake  <u>install()</u>  command).   However,  starting  with  CPack/CMake  2.8.3 RPM and DEB
       installers tries to handle <b>DESTDIR</b> automatically so that it is seldom necessary for the user to set it.

   <b>CPACK_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION</b>
       Ask CPack to warn each time a file with absolute <b>INSTALL</b> <b>DESTINATION</b> is encountered.

       This variable triggers the  definition  of  <u>CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION</u>  when  CPack  runs
       <b>cmake_install.cmake</b> scripts.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLE</b> <b>EXPANSION</b> <b>OPERATORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CACHE</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       Operator to read cache variables.

       Use  the  syntax  <b>$CACHE{VAR}</b> to read cache entry <b>VAR</b>.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-language.7.html">cmake-language</a>(7)</u> <u>variables</u> documentation
       for more complete documentation of the interaction of normal variables and cache entries.

       When evaluating <u>Variable</u> <u>References</u> of the form <b>${VAR}</b>, CMake first searches for a normal  variable  with
       that  name,  and if not found CMake will search for a cache entry with that name.  The <b>$CACHE{VAR}</b> syntax
       can be used to do direct cache lookup and ignore any existing normal variable.

       See the <u>set()</u> and <u>unset()</u> commands to see how to write or remove cache variables.

   <b>ENV</b>
       Operator to read environment variables.

       Use the syntax <b>$ENV{VAR}</b> to read environment variable <b>VAR</b>.

       To test whether an environment variable is defined, use the signature <b>if(DEFINED</b> <b>ENV{&lt;name&gt;})</b> of the <u>if()</u>
       command.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Environment variable names containing special characters like parentheses  may  need  to  be  escaped.
          (Policy  <u>CMP0053</u>  must  also  be  enabled.)   For example, to get the value of the Windows environment
          variable <b>ProgramFiles(x86)</b>, use:

              set(ProgramFiles_x86 "$ENV{ProgramFiles\(x86\)}")

       For general  information  on  environment  variables,  see  the  <u>Environment</u>  <u>Variables</u>  section  in  the
       <u><a href="../man7/cmake-language.7.html">cmake-language</a>(7)</u> manual.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       CMake  has  many internal variables.  Most of them are undocumented.  Some of them, however, were at some
       point described as normal variables, and therefore may be encountered in legacy code. They are subject to
       change, and not recommended for use in project code.

   <b>CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY</b>
       Path to top of source tree. Same as <u>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</u>.

       This is an internal cache entry used to locate the source directory when loading a <b>CMakeCache.txt</b> from  a
       build tree.  It should not be used in project code.  The variable <u>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</u> has the same value and
       should be preferred.

   <b>CMAKE_INTERNAL_PLATFORM_ABI</b>
       An internal variable subject to change.

       This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is subject to change.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ABI</b>
       An internal variable subject to change.

       This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is subject to change.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ARCHITECTURE_ID</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       An internal variable subject to change.

       This  is used to identify the variant of a compiler based on its target architecture.  For some compilers
       this is needed to determine the correct usage.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION_INTERNAL</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       An internal variable subject to change.

       This is used to identify the variant of a compiler  based  on  an  internal  version  number.   For  some
       compilers this is needed to determine the correct usage.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE</b>
       An internal variable subject to change.

       Preference value for linker language selection.

       The  "linker  language" for executable, shared library, and module targets is the language whose compiler
       will invoke the linker.  The <u>LINKER_LANGUAGE</u> target property sets the  language  explicitly.   Otherwise,
       the  linker language is that whose linker preference value is highest among languages compiled and linked
       into the target.  See also the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES</u> variable.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES</b>
       An internal variable subject to change.

       True if <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE</u> propagates across targets.

       This is used when CMake selects a linker language for a target.  Languages  compiled  directly  into  the
       target  are  always  considered.   A  language  compiled  into  static  libraries linked by the target is
       considered if this variable is true.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_PLATFORM_ID</b>
       An internal variable subject to change.

       This is used in determining the platform and is subject to change.

   <b>CMAKE_NOT_USING_CONFIG_FLAGS</b>
       Skip <b>_BUILD_TYPE</b> flags if true.

       This is an internal flag used by the generators in CMake to tell CMake to skip the <b>_BUILD_TYPE</b> flags.

   <b>CMAKE_VS_INTEL_Fortran_PROJECT_VERSION</b>
       When generating for <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>14</u> <u>2015</u> or greater  with  the  Intel  Fortran  plugin  installed,  this
       specifies the <b>.vfproj</b> project file format version.  This is intended for internal use by CMake and should
       not be used by project code.

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATED</b> <b>VARIABLES</b> <b>THAT</b> <b>PROVIDE</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR</b>
       Deprecated  since  version  3.27:  Support  for <u>Extra</u> <u>Generators</u> is deprecated and will be removed from a
       future version of CMake.  IDEs may use the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-file-api.7.html">cmake-file-api</a>(7)</u> to view CMake-generated project build trees.

       The extra generator used to build the project.  See <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generators.7.html">cmake-generators</a>(7)</u>.

       When using the Eclipse, CodeBlocks, CodeLite, Kate or Sublime generators, CMake  generates  Makefiles  (‐
       <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR</u>)  and additionally project files for the respective IDE.  This IDE project file generator
       is stored in <b>CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR</b> (e.g.  <b>Eclipse</b> <b>CDT4</b>).

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATED</b> <b>VARIABLES</b> <b>THAT</b> <b>CHANGE</b> <b>BEHAVIOR</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.15.

       Switch between strict and relaxed automoc mode.

       By default, <u>AUTOMOC</u> behaves exactly as described in the documentation of  the  <u>AUTOMOC</u>  target  property.
       When  set  to  <b>TRUE</b>,  it  accepts  more input and tries to find the correct input file for <b>moc</b> even if it
       differs from the documented behavior.  In this mode it  e.g.   also  checks  whether  a  header  file  is
       intended to be processed by moc when a <b>"foo.moc"</b> file has been included.

       Relaxed mode has to be enabled for KDE4 compatibility.

   <b>CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY</b>
       Deprecated.  See CMake Policy <u>CMP0001</u> documentation.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Deprecated since version 3.16: Use the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u> variable instead.

       By    default    this   variable   is   not   set.   If   neither   <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u>   nor
       <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b> is set, then <u>find_package()</u> will use  the  <u>User</u>  <u>Package</u>  <u>Registry</u>
       unless the <b>NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b> option is provided.

       <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b> is ignored if <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u> is set.

       In  some cases, for example to locate only system wide installations, it is not desirable to use the <u>User</u>
       <u>Package</u> <u>Registry</u> when searching for packages. If the <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b>  variable  is
       <b>TRUE</b>, all the <u>find_package()</u> commands will skip the <u>User</u> <u>Package</u> <u>Registry</u> as if they were called with the
       <b>NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b> argument.

       See also <u>Disabling</u> <u>the</u> <u>Package</u> <u>Registry</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Deprecated since version 3.16: Use the <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u> variable instead.

       By   default   this   variable   is   not  set.  If  neither  <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u>  nor
       <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b> is set, then <u>find_package()</u> will  use  the  <u>System</u>  <u>Package</u>
       <u>Registry</u> unless the <b>NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b> option is provided.

       <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b>  is  ignored  if  <u>CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</u> is
       set.

       In some cases, it is not desirable to use the <u>System</u> <u>Package</u> <u>Registry</u> when searching for packages. If the
       <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b> variable is <b>TRUE</b>, all the <u>find_package()</u> commands will skip
       the <u>System</u> <u>Package</u> <u>Registry</u> as if they were called with the <b>NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b> argument.

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATED</b> <b>VARIABLES</b> <b>THAT</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>THE</b> <b>BUILD</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CMAKE_IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED</b>
       Added in version 3.5.

       Deprecated since version 3.28: This is deprecated because <u>IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED</u> is deprecated.

       Default value for <u>IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED</u> of targets.
