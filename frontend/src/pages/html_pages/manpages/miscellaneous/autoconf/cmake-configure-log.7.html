</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cmake-configure-log - CMake Configure Log

       Added in version 3.26.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       CMake writes a running log, known as the <u>configure</u> <u>log</u>, of certain events that occur during the Configure
       step.   The  configure  log  does  <u>not</u>  contain  a  log  of all output, errors, or messages printed while
       configuring a project.  It is a log of detailed information about  specific  events,  such  as  toolchain
       inspection by <u>try_compile()</u>, meant for use in debugging the configuration of a build tree.

       For human use, this version of CMake writes the configure log to the file:

          ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/CMakeFiles/CMakeConfigureLog.yaml

       However,  the  <u>location</u> <u>and</u> <u>name</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>log</u> <u>file</u> <u>may</u> <u>change</u> in future versions of CMake.  Tools that read
       the configure log should get its location using a <u>configureLog</u> query to the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-file-api.7.html">cmake-file-api</a>(7)</u>.   See  the
       <u>Log</u> <u>Versioning</u> section below for details.

</pre><h4><b>LOG</b> <b>STRUCTURE</b></h4><pre>
       The configure log is designed to be both machine- and human-readable.

       The  log  file  is  a  YAML  document stream containing zero or more YAML documents separated by document
       markers.  Each document begins with a <b>---</b> document marker line, contains a single YAML mapping that  logs
       events  from  one  CMake  "configure" step, and, if the configure step finished normally, ends with a <b>...</b>
       document marker line:

          ---
          events:
            -
              kind: "try_compile-v1"
              # (other fields omitted)
            -
              kind: "try_compile-v1"
              # (other fields omitted)
          ...

       A new document is appended to the log every time CMake configures the build tree and logs new events.

       The keys of each document root mapping are:

       <b>events</b> A YAML block sequence of nodes corresponding to events logged during one CMake  "configure"  step.
              Each event is a YAML node containing one of the <u>Event</u> <u>Kinds</u> documented below.

   <b>Log</b> <b>Versioning</b>
       Each  of  the  <u>Event</u>  <u>Kinds</u> is versioned independently.  The set of keys an event's log entry provides is
       specific to its major version.  When an event is logged, the latest version of its  event  kind  that  is
       known to the running version of CMake is always written to the log.

       Tools reading the configure log must ignore event kinds and versions they do not understand:

       • A future version of CMake may introduce a new event kind or version.

       • If  an  existing  build  tree  is  re-configured with a different version of CMake, the log may contain
         different versions of the same event kind.

       • If <u><a href="../man7/cmake-file-api.7.html">cmake-file-api</a>(7)</u> queries request one or more <u>configureLog</u> object  versions,  the  log  may  contain
         multiple entries for the same event, each with a different version of its event kind.

       IDEs  should  write  a  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-file-api.7.html">cmake-file-api</a>(7)</u> query requesting a specific <u>configureLog</u> object version, before
       running CMake, and then read the configure log only as described by the file-api reply.

   <b>Text</b> <b>Block</b> <b>Encoding</b>
       In order to make the log human-readable, text blocks are always  represented  using  YAML  literal  block
       scalars  (<b>|</b>).   Since  literal  block  scalars  do  not  support  escaping, backslashes and non-printable
       characters are encoded at the application layer:

       • <b>\\</b> encodes a backslash.

       • <b>\xXX</b> encodes a byte using two hexadecimal digits, <b>XX</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>KINDS</b></h4><pre>
       Every event kind is represented by a YAML mapping of the form:

          kind: "&lt;kind&gt;-v&lt;major&gt;"
          backtrace:
            - "&lt;file&gt;:&lt;line&gt; (&lt;function&gt;)"
          checks:
            - "Checking for something"
          #...event-specific keys...

       The keys common to all events are:

       <b>kind</b>   A string identifying the event kind and major version.

       <b>backtrace</b>
              A YAML block sequence reporting the call stack of  CMake  source  locations  at  which  the  event
              occurred,  from  most-recent  to  least-recent.   Each  node  is  a string specifying one location
              formatted as <b>&lt;file&gt;:&lt;line&gt;</b> <b>(&lt;function&gt;)</b>.

       <b>checks</b> An  optional  key  that  is  present  when  the  event  occurred  with  at   least   one   pending
              <u>message(CHECK_START)</u>.   Its  value is a YAML block sequence reporting the stack of pending checks,
              from most-recent to least-recent.  Each node is a string containing a pending check message.

       Additional mapping keys are specific to each (versioned) event kind, described below.

   <b>Event</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>message</b>
       The <u>message(CONFIGURE_LOG)</u> command logs <b>message</b> events.

       There is only one <b>message</b> event major version, version 1.

   <b>message-v1</b> <b>Event</b>
       A <b>message-v1</b> event is a YAML mapping:

          kind: "message-v1"
          backtrace:
            - "CMakeLists.txt:123 (message)"
          checks:
            - "Checking for something"
          message: |
            # ...

       The keys specific to <b>message-v1</b> mappings are:

       <b>message</b>
              A YAML literal block scalar  containing  the  message  text,  represented  using  our  <u>Text</u>  <u>Block</u>
              <u>Encoding</u>.

   <b>Event</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>try_compile</b>
       The <u>try_compile()</u> command logs <b>try_compile</b> events.

       There is only one <b>try_compile</b> event major version, version 1.

   <b>try_compile-v1</b> <b>Event</b>
       A <b>try_compile-v1</b> event is a YAML mapping:

          kind: "try_compile-v1"
          backtrace:
            - "CMakeLists.txt:123 (try_compile)"
          checks:
            - "Checking for something"
          description: "Explicit LOG_DESCRIPTION"
          directories:
            source: "/path/to/.../TryCompile-01234"
            binary: "/path/to/.../TryCompile-01234"
          cmakeVariables:
            SOME_VARIABLE: "Some Value"
          buildResult:
            variable: "COMPILE_RESULT"
            cached: true
            stdout: |
              # ...
            exitCode: 0

       The keys specific to <b>try_compile-v1</b> mappings are:

       <b>description</b>
              An  optional  key that is present when the <b>LOG_DESCRIPTION</b> <b>&lt;text&gt;</b> option was used.  Its value is a
              string containing the description <b>&lt;text&gt;</b>.

       <b>directories</b>
              A mapping describing the  directories  associated  with  the  compilation  attempt.   It  has  the
              following keys:

              <b>source</b> String specifying the source directory of the <u>try_compile()</u> project.

              <b>binary</b> String  specifying  the  binary  directory  of  the <u>try_compile()</u> project.  For non-project
                     invocations, this is often the same as the source directory.

       <b>cmakeVariables</b>
              An optional key that is present when CMake propagates variables  into  the  test  project,  either
              automatically or due to the <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES</u> variable.  Its value is a mapping
              from variable names to their values.

       <b>buildResult</b>
              A mapping describing the result of compiling the test code.  It has the following keys:

              <b>variable</b>
                     A  string  specifying  the name of the CMake variable storing the result of trying to build
                     the test project.

              <b>cached</b> A boolean indicating whether the above result <b>variable</b> is stored in the CMake cache.

              <b>stdout</b> A YAML literal  block  scalar  containing  the  output  from  building  the  test  project,
                     represented using our <u>Text</u> <u>Block</u> <u>Encoding</u>.  This contains build output from both stdout and
                     stderr.

              <b>exitCode</b>
                     An integer specifying the build tool exit code from trying to build the test project.

   <b>Event</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>try_run</b>
       The <u>try_run()</u> command logs <b>try_run</b> events.

       There is only one <b>try_run</b> event major version, version 1.

   <b>try_run-v1</b> <b>Event</b>
       A <b>try_run-v1</b> event is a YAML mapping:

          kind: "try_run-v1"
          backtrace:
            - "CMakeLists.txt:456 (try_run)"
          checks:
            - "Checking for something"
          description: "Explicit LOG_DESCRIPTION"
          directories:
            source: "/path/to/.../TryCompile-56789"
            binary: "/path/to/.../TryCompile-56789"
          buildResult:
            variable: "COMPILE_RESULT"
            cached: true
            stdout: |
              # ...
            exitCode: 0
          runResult:
            variable: "RUN_RESULT"
            cached: true
            stdout: |
              # ...
            stderr: |
              # ...
            exitCode: 0

       The keys specific to <b>try_run-v1</b> mappings include those documented by the <u>try_compile-v1</u> <u>event</u>, plus:

       <b>runResult</b>
              A mapping describing the result of running the test code.  It has the following keys:

              <b>variable</b>
                     A  string specifying the name of the CMake variable storing the result of trying to run the
                     test executable.

              <b>cached</b> A boolean indicating whether the above result <b>variable</b> is stored in the CMake cache.

              <b>stdout</b> An optional key that is present when the test project built successfully.  Its value  is  a
                     YAML  literal  block scalar containing output from running the test executable, represented
                     using our <u>Text</u> <u>Block</u> <u>Encoding</u>.

                     If <b>RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> was used, stdout and stderr are  captured  together,  so  this  will
                     contain both.  Otherwise, this will contain only the stdout output.

              <b>stderr</b> An  optional  key  that  is  present  when  the  test  project  built  successfully and the
                     <b>RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> option was not  used.   Its  value  is  a  YAML  literal  block  scalar
                     containing  output  from  running  the  test  executable,  represented using our <u>Text</u> <u>Block</u>
                     <u>Encoding</u>.

                     If <b>RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> was used, stdout and stderr are captured together in the <b>stdout</b> key,
                     and this key will not be present.  Otherwise, this will contain the stderr output.

              <b>exitCode</b>
                     An optional key that is present when the test project built successfully.  Its value is  an
                     integer  specifying  the exit code, or a string containing an error message, from trying to
                     run the test executable.
