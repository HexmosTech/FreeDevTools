   <b>CMAKE_EXPORT_BUILD_DATABASE</b>
       Added in version 3.31.

       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       The default value for <u>CMAKE_EXPORT_BUILD_DATABASE</u> when there is no explicit configuration  given  on  the
       first run while creating a new build tree.  On later runs in an existing build tree the value persists in
       the cache as <u>CMAKE_EXPORT_BUILD_DATABASE</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This variable is meaningful only when experimental support for build databases has been enabled by the

       the cache as <u>CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Specifies the CMake default generator to use when no generator is supplied with <u>-G</u>. If the provided value
       doesn't name a generator known by CMake,  the  internal  default  is  used.   Either  way  the  resulting
       generator selection is stored in the <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR</u> variable.

       Some generators may be additionally configured using the environment variables:

       • <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</u>

       • <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE</u>

   <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Default  value  for  <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE</u> if no Cache entry is present. This value is only applied if
       <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR</u> is set.

   <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Default value for <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM</u> if no Cache entry is present and  no  value  is  specified  by
       <u>cmake</u> <u>-A</u> option.  This value is only applied if <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR</u> is set.

   <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Default value for <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</u> if no Cache entry is present and no value is specified by <u>cmake</u>
       <u>-T</u> option.  This value is only applied if <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR</u> is set.

   <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE</b>
       Added in version 3.22.

       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       The  <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE</b>  environment  variable  allows  users  to  operate  CMake in an alternate mode of
       <u>file(INSTALL)</u> and <u>install()</u>.

       The default behavior for an installation is to copy  a  source  file  from  a  source  directory  into  a
       destination  directory.  This  environment  variable  however  allows the user to override this behavior,
       causing CMake to create symbolic links instead.

   <b>Usage</b> <b>Scenarios</b>
       Installing symbolic links rather than copying files can help in the following ways:

       • Conserving storage space because files do not have to be duplicated on disk.

       • Changes to the source of the symbolic link are seen at the install destination without having to re-run
         the install step.

       • Editing through the link at the install destination will modify the source of the  link.  This  may  be
         useful  when  dealing  with CMake project hierarchies, i.e. using <u>ExternalProject</u> and consistent source
         navigation and refactoring is desired across projects.

   <b>Allowed</b> <b>Values</b>
       The following values are allowed for <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE</b>:

       <b>COPY,</b> <b>empty</b> <b>or</b> <b>unset</b>
              Duplicate the file at its destination.  This is the default behavior.

       <b>ABS_SYMLINK</b>
              Create an <u>absolute</u> symbolic link to the source file at the destination.  Halt with an error if the
              link cannot be created.

       <b>ABS_SYMLINK_OR_COPY</b>
              Like <b>ABS_SYMLINK</b> but fall back to silently copying if the symlink couldn't be created.

       <b>REL_SYMLINK</b>
              Create a <u>relative</u> symbolic link to the source file at the destination.  Halt with an error if  the
              link cannot be created.

       <b>REL_SYMLINK_OR_COPY</b>
              Like <b>REL_SYMLINK</b> but fall back to silently copying if the symlink couldn't be created.

       <b>SYMLINK</b>
              Try  as  if  through  <b>REL_SYMLINK</b>  and  fall  back to <b>ABS_SYMLINK</b> if the referenced file cannot be
              expressed using a relative path.  Halt with an error if the link cannot be created.

       <b>SYMLINK_OR_COPY</b>
              Like <b>SYMLINK</b> but fall back to silently copying if the symlink couldn't be created.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          A symbolic link consists of a reference file path rather than contents of its own, hence there are two
          ways to express the relation, either by a <u>relative</u> or an <u>absolute</u> path.

   <b>When</b> <b>To</b> <b>Set</b> <b>The</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Variable</b>
       For the environment variable to take effect, it must be set during the correct build phase(s).

       • If the project  calls  <u>file(INSTALL)</u>  directly,  the  environment  variable  must  be  set  during  the
         configuration phase.

       • In  order  to apply to <u>install()</u>, the environment variable must be set during installation.  This could
         be during a build if using the <b>install</b> or <b>package</b> build  targets,  or  separate  from  the  build  when
         invoking an install or running <u>cpack</u> from the command line.

       • When  using  <u>ExternalProject</u>, it might be required during the build phase, since the external project's
         own configure, build and install steps will execute during the main project's build phase.

       Given the above, it is recommended to  set  the  environment  variable  consistently  across  all  phases
       (configure, build and install).

   <b>Caveats</b>
       Use this environment variable with caution. The following highlights some points to be considered:

       • <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE</b> only affects files, not directories.

       • Symbolic links are not available on all platforms.

       • The  way  this environment variable interacts with the install step of <u>ExternalProject</u> is more complex.
         For further details, see that module's documentation.

       • A symbolic link ties the destination to the source in a persistent way.  Writing to either of  the  two
         affects  both  file  system  objects.  This is in contrast to normal install behavior which only copies
         files as they were at the time the install was performed, with no  enduring  relationship  between  the
         source and destination of the install.

       • Combining <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE</b> with <u>IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED</u> is not supported.

       • Changing  <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE</b> from what it was on a previous run can lead to unexpected results.  Moving
         from a non-symlinking mode to a symlinking mode will discard any previous file at the destination,  but
         the reverse is not true.  Once a symlink exists at the destination, even if you switch to a non-symlink
         mode, the symlink will continue to exist at the destination and will not be replaced by an actual file.

   <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_PARALLEL_LEVEL</b>
       Added in version 3.31.

       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Specifies  the  default  maximum  number  of  concurrent  processes  to  use  when installing using <b>cmake</b>
       <b>--install</b>.

       This has no impact unless <u>INSTALL_PARALLEL</u> is enabled.

   <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       The  <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b>   environment   variable   specifies   a   custom   default   value   for   the
       <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>  variable  in  place  of  the  default  values  specified by CMake itself. The value
       specified must be an absolute path to a directory.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LAUNCHER</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Default compiler launcher to use for the specified language. Will only be used by CMake to initialize the
       variable on the first configuration. Afterwards, it  is  available  through  the  cache  setting  of  the
       variable of the same name. For any configuration run (including the first), the environment variable will
       be ignored if the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LAUNCHER</u> variable is defined.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES_EXCLUDE</b>
       Added in version 3.27.

       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       A  <u>semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  of  directories  to exclude from the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES</u>
       variable when it is automatically detected from the <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> compiler.

       This may be used to work around  misconfigured  compiler  drivers  that  pass  extraneous  implicit  link
       directories to their linker.

   <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_LAUNCHER</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Default  launcher  to  use when linking a target of the specified language. Will only be used by CMake to
       initialize the variable on the first configuration.   Afterwards,  it  is  available  through  the  cache
       setting  of  the  variable  of  the  same  name.  For  any  configuration  run (including the first), the
       environment variable will be ignored if the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_LAUNCHER</u> variable is defined.

   <b>CMAKE_MSVCIDE_RUN_PATH</b>
       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Extra PATH locations for custom commands when using <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>.

       The <b>CMAKE_MSVCIDE_RUN_PATH</b> environment variable sets the default  value  for  the  <u>CMAKE_MSVCIDE_RUN_PATH</u>
       variable if not already explicitly set.

   <b>CMAKE_NO_VERBOSE</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       Disables verbose output from CMake when <u>VERBOSE</u> environment variable is set.

       Only  your  build  tool  of  choice will still print verbose output when you start to actually build your
       project.

   <b>CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES</b>
       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Target specific architectures for macOS.

       The <b>CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES</b> environment variable sets the default value for  the  <u>CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES</u>
       variable. See <u>OSX_ARCHITECTURES</u> for more information.

   <b>CMAKE_TEST_LAUNCHER</b>
       Added in version 3.29.

       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       The  default  value for the <u>CMAKE_TEST_LAUNCHER</u> variable when there is no explicit configuration given on
       the first run while creating a new build tree.  On later  runs  in  an  existing  build  tree  the  value
       persists in the cache as <u>CMAKE_TEST_LAUNCHER</u>.

   <b>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       The  <b>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</b>  environment  variable  specifies  a default value for the <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u>
       variable when there is no explicit configuration given on the first run while creating a new build  tree.
       On later runs in an existing build tree the value persists in the cache as <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u>.

   <b>DESTDIR</b>
       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       On  UNIX  one  can  use the <b>DESTDIR</b> mechanism in order to relocate the whole installation.  <b>DESTDIR</b> means
       DESTination DIRectory.  It is commonly used by packagers to install software in a staging directory.

       For example, running

          make DESTDIR=/package/stage install

       will install the software using the installation prefix, e.g.  <b><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></b>,  prepended  with  the  <b>DESTDIR</b>
       value  which  gives <b>/package/stage/usr/local</b>.  The packaging tool may then construct the package from the
       content of the <b>/package/stage</b> directory.

       See the <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> variable to control the installation prefix when configuring a  build  tree.
       Or,  when using the <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u> command-line tool's <u>--install</u> mode, one may specify a different prefix using
       the <u>--prefix</u> option.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          <b>DESTDIR</b> may not be used on Windows because installation prefix usually contains a drive letter like in
          <b>C:/Program</b> <b>Files</b> which cannot be prepended with some other prefix.

   <b>LDFLAGS</b>
       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Will only be used by CMake on the first configuration to determine the default linker flags, after  which
       the    value    for    <b>LDFLAGS</b>    is    stored    in    the    cache    as   <u>CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT</u>,
       <u>CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT</u>, and <u>CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT</u>. For any configuration run  (including
       the  first),  the  environment variable will be ignored if the equivalent  <b>CMAKE_&lt;TYPE&gt;_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT</b>
       variable is defined.

   <b>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</b>
       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Specify the minimum version of macOS on which the target binaries are to be deployed.

       The   <b>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</b>   environment    variable    sets    the    default    value    for    the
       <u>CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</u> variable.

   <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Calls  to  <u>find_package(&lt;PackageName&gt;)</u>  will  search  in  prefixes  specified  by  the <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</b>
       environment variable, where <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> is the (case-preserved) name given to the  <u>find_package()</u>  call
       and  <b>_ROOT</b>  is  literal.   For  example, <b>find_package(Foo)</b> will search prefixes specified in the <b>Foo_ROOT</b>
       environment variable (if set).  See policy <u>CMP0074</u>.

       This variable may hold a single prefix or a list of prefixes separated by <b>:</b> on UNIX or <b>;</b> on Windows  (the
       same as the <b>PATH</b> environment variable convention on those platforms).

       See also the <u>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</u> CMake variable.

       <b>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;_ROOT</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              Calls  to  <u>find_package(&lt;PackageName&gt;)</u>  will  also  search in prefixes specified by the upper-case
              <b>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;_ROOT</b> environment variable.  See policy <u>CMP0144</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Note that the <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_ROOT</b> and <b>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;_ROOT</b> environment variables  are  distinct  only  on
          platforms that have case-sensitive environments.

   <b>VERBOSE</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       Activates  verbose output from CMake and your build tools of choice when you start to actually build your
       project.

       Note that any given value is ignored. It's just checked for existence.

       values are: <b>error</b>, <b>ignore</b>, empty or unset.

       The <u>--no-tests=&lt;action&gt;</u> option to <u>ctest</u> overrides this environment variable if both are given.

   <b>CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE</b>
       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Boolean environment variable that controls if the output should be logged for failed tests. Set the value
       to  <b>1</b>,  <b>True</b>, or <b>ON</b> to enable output on failure.  See <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> for more information on controlling output
       of failed tests.

   <b>CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL</b>
       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Specify the number of tests for CTest to run in parallel.  For example, if <b>CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL</b> is set to
       8, CTest will run up to 8 tests concurrently as if <b>ctest</b> were invoked with the <u>--parallel</u> <u>8</u> option.

       Changed in version 3.29: The value may be empty, or <b>0</b>, to let ctest use a default level  of  parallelism,
       or unbounded parallelism, respectively, as documented by the <u>ctest</u> <u>--parallel</u> option.

       On  Windows,  environment  variables  cannot  be  set  to  an  empty  string.   CTest  will  interpret  a
       whitespace-only string as empty.

       In CMake 3.28 and earlier, an empty or <b>0</b> value was equivalent to <b>1</b>.

       See <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> for more information on parallel test execution.

   <b>CTEST_PROGRESS_OUTPUT</b>
       Added in version 3.13.

       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Boolean environment variable that affects how <u>ctest</u> command output reports overall progress.  When set to
       <b>1</b>, <b>TRUE</b>, <b>ON</b> or anything else that evaluates to boolean true, progress is reported by repeatedly  updating
       the  same  line.   This  greatly reduces the overall verbosity, but is only supported when output is sent
       directly to a terminal.  If the environment variable is not set or has a value that evaluates  to  false,
       output is reported normally with each test having its own start and end lines logged to the output.

       The <u>--progress</u> option to <u>ctest</u> overrides this environment variable if both are given.

   <b>CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS_DEFAULT</b>
       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Initializes the <u>CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS</u> variable if not already defined.

   <b>DASHBOARD_TEST_FROM_CTEST</b>
       This is a CMake <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u>. Its initial value is taken from the calling process environment.

       Environment  variable  that  will  exist when a test executed by <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> is run in non-interactive mode.
       The value will be equal to <u>CMAKE_VERSION</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>THE</b> <b>CMAKE</b> <b>CURSES</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CCMAKE_COLORS</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       Determines what colors are used by the CMake curses interface, when  run  on  a  terminal  that  supports
       colors.   The  syntax  follows  the  same  conventions  as  <b>LS_COLORS</b>; that is, a list of key/value pairs
       separated by <b>:</b>.

       Keys are a single letter corresponding to a CMake cache variable type:

       • <b>s</b>: A <b>STRING</b>.

       • <b>p</b>: A <b>FILEPATH</b>.

       • <b>c</b>: A value which has an associated list of choices.

       • <b>y</b>: A <b>BOOL</b> which has a true-like value (e.g. <b>ON</b>, <b>YES</b>).

       • <b>n</b>: A <b>BOOL</b> which has a false-like value (e.g. <b>OFF</b>, <b>NO</b>).

       Values are an integer number that specifies what color to use.  <b>0</b> is black (you probably  don't  want  to
       use  that).  Others are determined by your terminal's color support.  Most (color) terminals will support
       at least 8 or 16 colors.  Some will support up to 256 colors. The colors will likely  match  <u>this</u>  <u>chart</u>,
       although  the  first 16 colors may match the original <u>CGA</u> <u>color</u> <u>palette</u>.  (Many modern terminal emulators
       also allow their color palette, at least for the first 16 colors, to be configured by the user.)

       Note that fairly minimal checking is done for bad colors  (although  a  value  higher  than  what  curses
       believes your terminal supports will be silently ignored) or bad syntax.

       For example:

          CCMAKE_COLORS='s=39:p=220:c=207:n=196:y=46'
