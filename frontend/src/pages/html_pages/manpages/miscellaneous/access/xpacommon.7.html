</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XPACommon</b> <b>-</b> <b>Getting</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Information</b> <b>About</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Points</b>

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       There are various kinds of generic information you can retrieve about an XPA access point by using the
       xpaget command.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You can find out which XPA access points have been registered with the currently running XPA name server
       by executing the xpaget command to retrieve info from the XPA name server:

         xpaget xpans

       If, for example, the stest test server program is running, the following XPA access points will be
       returned (the specifics of the returned info will vary for different machines and users):

         XPA xpa gs 838e2f67:1262 eric
         XPA xpa1 gs 838e2f67:1266 eric
         XPA c_xpa gs 838e2f67:1267 eric
         XPA i_xpa i 838e2f67:1268 eric

       Note that access to this information is subject to the usual XPA Access Control restrictions.

       Each XPA access point supports a number of reserved sub-commands that provide access to different kinds
       of information, e.g. the access control for that access point.  These sub-commands can be executed by
       using xpaset or xpaget at the command line, or <u>XPAGet()</u> or <u>XPASet()</u> in programs, e.g:

         xpaget ds9 -acl
         xpaget ds9 -help
         xpaget ds9 env FOO

         xpaset -p ds9 env FOO foofoo

       With the exception of <b>-help</b> and <b>-version</b>, reserved sub-commands are available only on the machine on
       which the XPA server itself is running.

       The following reserved sub-commands are defined for all access points:

       •   <b>-acl</b> get (set) the access control list [options: host type acl, for set]

           The  'xpaset'  option allows you to add a new acl for a given host, or change the acl for an existing
           host. See XPA Access Control for more information.  This access point is available only on the server
           machine.

       •   <b>-env</b> get (set) an environment variable [options: name (value, for set)]

           The 'xpaget' option will return the value of the named environment  variable.   The  'xpaset'  option
           will set the value of the names variable to the specified value.  This access point is available only
           on the server machine.  (Please be advised that we have had problems setting environment variables in
           static Tcl/Tk programs such as ds9 running under Linux.)

       •   <b>-clipboard</b> set(get) information on a named clipboard

           Clients  can  store ASCII state information on any number of named clipboards. Clipboards of the same
           name created by clients on different machines are kept separate.  The syntax for creating a clipboard
           is:

             [data] | xpaset [server] -clipboard add|append [clipboard_name]
             xpaset -p [server] -clipboard delete [clipboard_name]

           Use "add" to create a new clipboard or replace the contents of  an  existing  one.  Use  "append"  to
           append to an existing clipboard.

           Information on a named clipboard is retrieved using:

             xpaget [server] -clipboard [clipboard_name]

       •   <b>-exec</b> set: execute commands from buffer [options: none]

           If  -exec  is  specified  in  the  paramlist  of  an 'xpaset' call, then further sub-commands will be
           retrieved from the data buffer.

       •   <b>-help</b> get: return help string for this XPA or sub-command [options: name (for sub-commands)]

           Each XPA access point and each XPA sub-command can have a help string  associated  with  it  that  is
           specified  when the access point is defined.  The -help option will return this help string.  For XPA
           access points that contain user-defined sub-commands, you can get the help string  for  a  particular
           sub-command  by specifying its name, or else get the help strings for all sub-commands if not name is
           specified.

       •   <b>-ltimeout</b> get (set) the long timeout value [options: seconds|reset]

           The 'xpaget' option will return the value of the long timeout (in seconds).  The 'xpaset' option will
           set the value of the long timeout. If "reset" is specified, then the timeout value will be  reset  to
           the default value.

       •   <b>-nsconnect</b> set: re-establish name server connection to all XPA's [options: none]

           If  the  XPA  Name  Server (xpans) process has terminated unexpectedly and then re-started, this sub-
           command can be used to re-establish the connection.  You  use  it  by  sending  the  command  to  the
           [name:port]  or  [file] of the access point instead of to the XPA name (since the latter requires the
           xpans connection!):

             xpaset -p 838e2f67:1268 -nsconnect

           See xpans for more information.

       •   <b>-nsdisconnect</b> set: break name server connection to all XPA's [options: none]

           This sub-command will terminate the connection to the XPA Name Server  (xpans),  thereby  making  all
           access  points  inaccessible  except  through  their underlying [name:port] or [file] identifiers.  I
           forget why we added it, it seems pretty useless.

       •   <b>-stimeout</b> get (set) the short timeout value [options: seconds|reset]

           The 'xpaget' option will return the value of the short timeout (in  seconds).   The  'xpaset'  option
           will  set  the  value  of  the short timeout. If "reset" is specified, then the timeout value will be
           reset to the default value.

       •   <b>-remote</b> set: register xpa with remote server [options: host[:port] [acl]] [-proxy]

           This sub-command will register the XPA access point with the XPA name server (xpans) on the specified
           host (which must already be running).  The specified host also is given access control to the  access
           point, using the specified acl or the default acl of "+" (meaning the remote host can xpaset, xpaget,
           xpainfo  or  xpaaccess).  If the acl is specified as "-", then the access point is unregistered.  See
           Communication Between Machines for more information on how this sub-command is used.

       •   <b>-version</b> get: return XPA version string [options: none]

           The version refers to the version of XPA used to define this access point (currently  something  like
           2.0).

       You can add your own reserved commands to all XPA access points by using the <u>XPACmdAdd()</u> routine, passing
       the  XPA  handle  returned  by <u>XPA</u> <u>XPAGetReserved(void)</u> as the first argument. Note again that these will
       only be available on the machine where the XPA service is running.
