</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       check_imap_quota - connects to an IMAP account and checks the quota

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        check_imap_quota -vV
        check_imap_quota -?
        check_imap_quota --help

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --warning &lt;seconds&gt;
           Warn  if  it  takes longer than &lt;seconds&gt; to connect to the IMAP server. Default is 15 seconds.  Also
           known as: -w &lt;seconds&gt;

       --critical &lt;seconds&gt;
           Return a critical status if it takes longer than &lt;seconds&gt; to connect to the IMAP server. Default  is
           30 seconds.  See also: --capture-critical &lt;messages&gt; Also known as: -c &lt;seconds&gt;

       --timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
           Abort  with  critical status if it takes longer than &lt;seconds&gt; to connect to the IMAP server. Default
           is 60 seconds.  The difference between timeout and critical is that, with the default settings, if it
           takes 45 seconds to connect to the server then the connection will succeed but the plugin will return
           CRITICAL because it took longer than 30 seconds.  Also known as: -t &lt;seconds&gt;

       --hostname &lt;server&gt;
           Address or name of the IMAP server. Examples: mail.server.com, localhost,  192.168.1.100  Also  known
           as: -H &lt;server&gt;

       --port &lt;number&gt;
           Service  port  on the IMAP server. Default is 143. If you use SSL, default is 993.  Also known as: -p
           &lt;number&gt;

       --username &lt;username&gt;
       --password &lt;password&gt;
           Username and password to use when connecting to  IMAP  server.   Also  known  as:  -U  &lt;username&gt;  -P
           &lt;password&gt;

       --mailbox &lt;mailbox&gt;
           Use  this  option to specify the mailbox to search for messages. Default is INBOX.  Also known as: -m
           &lt;mailbox&gt;

       --ssl
       --nossl
           Enable SSL protocol. Requires IO::Socket::SSL.

           Using this option automatically changes the default port from 143 to 993. You can still override this
           from the command line using the --port option.

           Use the nossl option to turn off the ssl option.

       --hires
           Use the Time::HiRes module to measure time, if available.

       --verbose
           Display additional information. Useful for troubleshooting. Use together with --version  to  see  the
           default warning and critical timeout values.

           If  the selected mailbox was not found, you can use verbosity level 3 (-vvv) to display a list of all
           available mailboxes on the server.

           Also known as: -v

       --version
           Display plugin version and exit.  Also known as: -V

       --help
           Display this documentation and exit. Does not work in the ePN version.  Also known as: -h

       --usage
           Display a short usage instruction and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Report</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>emails</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mailbox</b>
        $ check_imap_receive -H mail.server.net --username mailuser --password mailpass
        -s ALL --nodelete

        IMAP RECEIVE OK - 1 seconds, 7 found

   <b>Report</b> <b>the</b> <b>email</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>value</b>
       Suppose your mailbox has some emails from an automated  script  and  that  a  message  from  this  script
       typically looks like this (abbreviated):

        To: <a href="mailto:mailuser@server.net">mailuser@server.net</a>
        From: <a href="mailto:autoscript@server.net">autoscript@server.net</a>
        Subject: Results of Autoscript
        Date: Wed, 09 Nov 2005 08:30:40 -0800
        Message-ID: &lt;<a href="mailto:auto-000000992528@server.net">auto-000000992528@server.net</a>&gt;

        Homeruns 5

       And  further suppose that you are interested in reporting the message that has the highest number of home
       runs, and also to leave this message in the mailbox for future checks,  but  remove  the  other  matching
       messages with lesser values:

        $ check_imap_receive -H mail.server.net --username mailuser --password mailpass
        -s SUBJECT -s "Results of Autoscript" --capture-max "Homeruns (\d+)"  --nodelete-captured

        IMAP RECEIVE OK - 1 seconds, 3 found, 1 captured, 5 max, 2 deleted

   <b>Troubleshoot</b> <b>your</b> <b>search</b> <b>parameters</b>
       Add the --nodelete and --imap-retries=1 parameters to your command line.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       Complies with the Nagios plug-in specification:
        0         OK             The  plugin  was  able  to  check the service and it appeared to be functioning
       properly
        1         Warning        The plugin was able to check the service, but it  appeared  to  be  above  some
       "warning" threshold or did not appear to be working properly
        2         Critical  The  plugin  detected  that  either the service was not running or it was above some
       "critical" threshold
        3         Unknown        Invalid command line arguments were supplied to the plugin or  the  plugin  was
       unable to check the status of the given hosts/service

</pre><h4><b>NAGIOS</b> <b>PLUGIN</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Nagios plugin reference: <a href="http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/developer-guidelines.html">http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/developer-guidelines.html</a>

       This  plugin  does  NOT  use Nagios DEFAULT_SOCKET_TIMEOUT (provided by utils.pm as $TIMEOUT) because the
       path to utils.pm must be specified completely in this program and forces users to edit the source code if
       their install location is different (if they realize this is the  problem).  You  can  view  the  default
       timeout for this module by using the --verbose and --version options together.  The short form is -vV.

       Other than that, it attempts to follow published guidelines for Nagios plugins.
