       openssl-glossary - An OpenSSL Glossary

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Algorithm
           Cryptographic  primitives  such as the SHA256 digest, or AES encryption are referred to in OpenSSL as
           "algorithms". There can be more than one implementation for any given algorithm available for use.

       ASN.1, ASN1
           ASN.1 ("Abstract Syntax Notation One") is a notation for describing abstract types and values.  It is
           defined in the ITU-T documents X.680 to X.683:

           &lt;https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.680&gt;,                         &lt;https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.681&gt;,
           &lt;https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.682&gt;, &lt;https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.683&gt;

       Base Provider
           An  OpenSSL  Provider  that  contains  encoders  and  decoders  for  OpenSSL keys.  All the algorithm
           implementations in the Base Provider are also available in the Default Provider.

           <b><a href="../man7/OSSL_PROVIDER-base.7.html">OSSL_PROVIDER-base</a></b>(7)

       Decoder
           A decoder is a type of algorithm used for decoding keys and parameters from some external format such
           as PEM or DER.

           <b><a href="../man3/OSSL_DECODER_CTX_new_for_pkey.3.html">OSSL_DECODER_CTX_new_for_pkey</a></b>(3)

       Default Provider
           An OpenSSL Provider that contains the most common OpenSSL algorithm implementations. It is loaded  by
           default if no other provider is available. All the algorithm implementations in the Base Provider are
           also available in the Default Provider.

           <b><a href="../man7/OSSL_PROVIDER-default.7.html">OSSL_PROVIDER-default</a></b>(7)

       DER ("Distinguished Encoding Rules")
           DER  is  a binary encoding of data, structured according to an ASN.1 specification.  This is a common
           encoding used for cryptographic objects such as private and public keys, certificates, CRLs, ...

           It is defined in ITU-T document X.690:

           &lt;https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.690&gt;

       Encoder
           An encoder is a type of algorithm used for encoding keys and parameters to some external format  such
           as PEM or DER.

       Explicit Fetching
           Explicit Fetching is a type of Fetching (see Fetching). Explicit Fetching is where a function call is
           made  to  obtain  an  algorithm  object  representing  an  implementation  such as <b><a href="../man3/EVP_MD_fetch.3.html">EVP_MD_fetch</a></b>(3) or
           <b><a href="../man3/EVP_CIPHER_fetch.3.html">EVP_CIPHER_fetch</a></b>(3)

       Fetching
           Fetching is the  process  of  looking  through  the  available  algorithm  implementations,  applying
           selection  criteria  (via a property query string), and finally choosing the implementation that will
           be used.

           Also see Explicit Fetching and Implicit Fetching.

       FIPS Provider
           An OpenSSL Provider  that  contains  OpenSSL  algorithm  implementations  that  have  been  validated
           according to the FIPS 140-2 standard.

           <b><a href="../man7/OSSL_PROVIDER-FIPS.7.html">OSSL_PROVIDER-FIPS</a></b>(7)

       Implicit Fetching
           Implicit  Fetching  is  a  type  of  Fetching (see Fetching). Implicit Fetching is where an algorithm
           object with no associated implementation is used such as  the  return  value  from  <b><a href="../man3/EVP_sha256.3.html">EVP_sha256</a></b>(3)  or
           <b><a href="../man3/EVP_aes_128_cbc.3.html">EVP_aes_128_cbc</a></b>(3).  With  implicit fetching an implementation is fetched automatically using default
           selection criteria the first time the algorithm is used.

       Legacy Provider
           An OpenSSL Provider that contains algorithm implementations that are considered insecure  or  are  no
           longer in common use.

           <b><a href="../man7/OSSL_PROVIDER-legacy.7.html">OSSL_PROVIDER-legacy</a></b>(7)

       Library Context
           A Library Context in OpenSSL is represented by the type <b>OSSL_LIB_CTX</b>. It can be thought of as a scope
           within  which  configuration  options  apply.  If an application does not explicitly create a library
           context then the "default" one is used. Many OpenSSL functions can  take  a  library  context  as  an
           argument.  A NULL value can always be passed to indicate the default library context.

           <b><a href="../man3/OSSL_LIB_CTX.3.html">OSSL_LIB_CTX</a></b>(3)

       MSBLOB
           MSBLOB  is  a  Microsoft  specific binary format for RSA and DSA keys, both private and public.  This
           form is never passphrase protected.

       Null Provider
           An OpenSSL Provider that contains no algorithm implementations. This can be  useful  to  prevent  the
           default provider from being automatically loaded in a library context.

           <b><a href="../man7/OSSL_PROVIDER-null.7.html">OSSL_PROVIDER-null</a></b>(7)

       Operation
           An operation is a group of OpenSSL functions with a common purpose such as encryption, or digesting.

           <b><a href="../man7/crypto.7.html">crypto</a></b>(7)

       PEM ("Privacy Enhanced Message")
           PEM is a format used for encoding of binary content into a mail and ASCII friendly form.  The content
           is  a  series  of  base64-encoded lines, surrounded by begin/end markers each on their own line.  For
           example:

            -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
            MIICdg....
            ... bhTQ==

            -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
           Optional header line(s) may appear after the begin line, and their existence depends on the  type  of
           object being written or read.

           For all OpenSSL uses, the binary content is expected to be a DER encoded structure.

           This is defined in IETF RFC 1421:

           &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1421&gt;

       PKCS#8
           PKCS#8  is  a  specification  of  ASN.1  structures that OpenSSL uses for storing or transmitting any
           private key in a key type agnostic manner.  There are two structures worth noting  for  OpenSSL  use,
           one  that  contains  the  key  data  in unencrypted form (known as "PrivateKeyInfo") and an encrypted
           wrapper structure (known as "EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo").

           This is specified in RFC 5208:

           &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5208&gt;

       Property
           A property is a way of  classifying  and  selecting  algorithm  implementations.   A  property  is  a
           key/value  pair  expressed  as  a  string.  For  example all algorithm implementations in the default
           provider have the  property  "provider=default".   An  algorithm  implementation  can  have  multiple
           properties defined against it.

           Also see Property Query String.

           <b><a href="../man7/property.7.html">property</a></b>(7)

       Property Query String
           A property query string is a string containing a sequence of properties that can be used to select an
           algorithm  implementation.  For  example  the  query  string  "provider=example,foo=bar"  will select
           algorithms from the "example" provider that have a "foo" property defined for them with  a  value  of
           "bar".

           Property Query Strings are used during fetching. See Fetching.

           <b><a href="../man7/property.7.html">property</a></b>(7)

       Provider
           A  provider  in  OpenSSL is a component that groups together algorithm implementations. Providers can
           come from OpenSSL itself or from third parties.

           <b><a href="../man7/provider.7.html">provider</a></b>(7)

       PVK PVK is a Microsoft specific binary format for RSA and DSA private keys.  This form may be  passphrase
           protected.

       SubjectPublicKeyInfo
           SubjectPublicKeyInfo  is an ASN.1 structure that OpenSSL uses for storing and transmitting any public
           key in a key type agnostic manner.

           This is specified as part of the specification for certificates, RFC 5280:

           &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280&gt;
