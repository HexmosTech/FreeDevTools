       CREATE_POLICY - define a new row-level security policy for a table

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CREATE POLICY <u>name</u> ON <u>table_name</u>
           [ AS { PERMISSIVE | RESTRICTIVE } ]
           [ FOR { ALL | SELECT | INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE } ]
           [ TO { <u>role_name</u> | PUBLIC | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER } [, ...] ]
           [ USING ( <u>using_expression</u> ) ]
           [ WITH CHECK ( <u>check_expression</u> ) ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>CREATE</b> <b>POLICY</b> command defines a new row-level security policy for a table. Note that row-level
       security must be enabled on the table (using <b>ALTER</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>...</b> <b>ENABLE</b> <b>ROW</b> <b>LEVEL</b> <b>SECURITY</b>) in order for
       created policies to be applied.

       A policy grants the permission to select, insert, update, or delete rows that match the relevant policy
       expression. Existing table rows are checked against the expression specified in USING, while new rows
       that would be created via INSERT or UPDATE are checked against the expression specified in WITH CHECK.
       When a USING expression returns true for a given row then that row is visible to the user, while if false
       or null is returned then the row is not visible. When a WITH CHECK expression returns true for a row then
       that row is inserted or updated, while if false or null is returned then an error occurs.

       For <b>INSERT</b>, <b>UPDATE</b>, and <b>MERGE</b> statements, WITH CHECK expressions are enforced after BEFORE triggers are
       fired, and before any actual data modifications are made. Thus a BEFORE ROW trigger may modify the data
       to be inserted, affecting the result of the security policy check.  WITH CHECK expressions are enforced
       before any other constraints.

       Policy names are per-table. Therefore, one policy name can be used for many different tables and have a
       definition for each table which is appropriate to that table.

       Policies can be applied for specific commands or for specific roles. The default for newly created
       policies is that they apply for all commands and roles, unless otherwise specified. Multiple policies may
       apply to a single command; see below for more details.  Table 297 summarizes how the different types of
       policy apply to specific commands.

       For policies that can have both USING and WITH CHECK expressions (ALL and UPDATE), if no WITH CHECK
       expression is defined, then the USING expression will be used both to determine which rows are visible
       (normal USING case) and which new rows will be allowed to be added (WITH CHECK case).

       If row-level security is enabled for a table, but no applicable policies exist, a “default deny” policy
       is assumed, so that no rows will be visible or updatable.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>name</u>
           The name of the policy to be created. This must be distinct from the name of any other policy for the
           table.

       <u>table_name</u>
           The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table the policy applies to.

       PERMISSIVE
           Specify that the policy is to be created as a permissive policy. All permissive policies which are
           applicable to a given query will be combined together using the Boolean “OR” operator. By creating
           permissive policies, administrators can add to the set of records which can be accessed. Policies are
           permissive by default.

       RESTRICTIVE
           Specify that the policy is to be created as a restrictive policy. All restrictive policies which are
           applicable to a given query will be combined together using the Boolean “AND” operator. By creating
           restrictive policies, administrators can reduce the set of records which can be accessed as all
           restrictive policies must be passed for each record.

           Note that there needs to be at least one permissive policy to grant access to records before
           restrictive policies can be usefully used to reduce that access. If only restrictive policies exist,
           then no records will be accessible. When a mix of permissive and restrictive policies are present, a
           record is only accessible if at least one of the permissive policies passes, in addition to all the
           restrictive policies.

       <u>command</u>
           The command to which the policy applies. Valid options are <b>ALL</b>, <b>SELECT</b>, <b>INSERT</b>, <b>UPDATE</b>, and <b>DELETE</b>.
           <b>ALL</b> is the default. See below for specifics regarding how these are applied.

       <u>role_name</u>
           The role(s) to which the policy is to be applied. The default is PUBLIC, which will apply the policy
           to all roles.

       <u>using_expression</u>
           Any SQL conditional expression (returning boolean). The conditional expression cannot contain any
           aggregate or window functions. This expression will be added to queries that refer to the table if
           row-level security is enabled. Rows for which the expression returns true will be visible. Any rows
           for which the expression returns false or null will not be visible to the user (in a <b>SELECT</b>), and
           will not be available for modification (in an <b>UPDATE</b> or <b>DELETE</b>). Such rows are silently suppressed;
           no error is reported.

       <u>check_expression</u>
           Any SQL conditional expression (returning boolean). The conditional expression cannot contain any
           aggregate or window functions. This expression will be used in <b>INSERT</b> and <b>UPDATE</b> queries against the
           table if row-level security is enabled. Only rows for which the expression evaluates to true will be
           allowed. An error will be thrown if the expression evaluates to false or null for any of the records
           inserted or any of the records that result from the update. Note that the <u>check_expression</u> is
           evaluated against the proposed new contents of the row, not the original contents.

   <b>Per-Command</b> <b>Policies</b>
       ALL
           Using ALL for a policy means that it will apply to all commands, regardless of the type of command.
           If an ALL policy exists and more specific policies exist, then both the ALL policy and the more
           specific policy (or policies) will be applied. Additionally, ALL policies will be applied to both the
           selection side of a query and the modification side, using the USING expression for both cases if
           only a USING expression has been defined.

           As an example, if an UPDATE is issued, then the ALL policy will be applicable both to what the UPDATE
           will be able to select as rows to be updated (applying the USING expression), and to the resulting
           updated rows, to check if they are permitted to be added to the table (applying the WITH CHECK
           expression, if defined, and the USING expression otherwise). If an <b>INSERT</b> or <b>UPDATE</b> command attempts
           to add rows to the table that do not pass the ALL policy's WITH CHECK expression, the entire command
           will be aborted.

       SELECT
           Using SELECT for a policy means that it will apply to SELECT queries and whenever SELECT permissions
           are required on the relation the policy is defined for. The result is that only those records from
           the relation that pass the SELECT policy will be returned during a SELECT query, and that queries
           that require SELECT permissions, such as UPDATE, will also only see those records that are allowed by
           the SELECT policy. A SELECT policy cannot have a WITH CHECK expression, as it only applies in cases
           where records are being retrieved from the relation.

       INSERT
           Using INSERT for a policy means that it will apply to INSERT commands and MERGE commands that contain
           INSERT actions. Rows being inserted that do not pass this policy will result in a policy violation
           error, and the entire INSERT command will be aborted. An INSERT policy cannot have a USING
           expression, as it only applies in cases where records are being added to the relation.

           Note that INSERT with ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE checks INSERT policies' WITH CHECK expressions only for
           rows appended to the relation by the INSERT path.

       UPDATE
           Using UPDATE for a policy means that it will apply to UPDATE, SELECT FOR UPDATE and SELECT FOR SHARE
           commands, as well as auxiliary ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE clauses of INSERT commands.  MERGE commands
           containing UPDATE actions are affected as well. Since UPDATE involves pulling an existing record and
           replacing it with a new modified record, UPDATE policies accept both a USING expression and a WITH
           CHECK expression. The USING expression determines which records the UPDATE command will see to
           operate against, while the WITH CHECK expression defines which modified rows are allowed to be stored
           back into the relation.

           Any rows whose updated values do not pass the WITH CHECK expression will cause an error, and the
           entire command will be aborted. If only a USING clause is specified, then that clause will be used
           for both USING and WITH CHECK cases.

           Typically an UPDATE command also needs to read data from columns in the relation being updated (e.g.,
           in a WHERE clause or a RETURNING clause, or in an expression on the right hand side of the SET
           clause). In this case, SELECT rights are also required on the relation being updated, and the
           appropriate SELECT or ALL policies will be applied in addition to the UPDATE policies. Thus the user
           must have access to the row(s) being updated through a SELECT or ALL policy in addition to being
           granted permission to update the row(s) via an UPDATE or ALL policy.

           When an INSERT command has an auxiliary ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE clause, if the UPDATE path is taken,
           the row to be updated is first checked against the USING expressions of any UPDATE policies, and then
           the new updated row is checked against the WITH CHECK expressions. Note, however, that unlike a
           standalone UPDATE command, if the existing row does not pass the USING expressions, an error will be
           thrown (the UPDATE path will <u>never</u> be silently avoided).

       DELETE
           Using DELETE for a policy means that it will apply to DELETE commands. Only rows that pass this
           policy will be seen by a DELETE command. There can be rows that are visible through a SELECT that are
           not available for deletion, if they do not pass the USING expression for the DELETE policy.

           In most cases a DELETE command also needs to read data from columns in the relation that it is
           deleting from (e.g., in a WHERE clause or a RETURNING clause). In this case, SELECT rights are also
           required on the relation, and the appropriate SELECT or ALL policies will be applied in addition to
           the DELETE policies. Thus the user must have access to the row(s) being deleted through a SELECT or
           ALL policy in addition to being granted permission to delete the row(s) via a DELETE or ALL policy.

           A DELETE policy cannot have a WITH CHECK expression, as it only applies in cases where records are
           being deleted from the relation, so that there is no new row to check.

   <b>Application</b> <b>of</b> <b>Multiple</b> <b>Policies</b>
       When multiple policies of different command types apply to the same command (for example, SELECT and
       UPDATE policies applied to an UPDATE command), then the user must have both types of permissions (for
       example, permission to select rows from the relation as well as permission to update them). Thus the
       expressions for one type of policy are combined with the expressions for the other type of policy using
       the AND operator.

       When multiple policies of the same command type apply to the same command, then there must be at least
       one PERMISSIVE policy granting access to the relation, and all of the RESTRICTIVE policies must pass.
       Thus all the PERMISSIVE policy expressions are combined using OR, all the RESTRICTIVE policy expressions
       are combined using AND, and the results are combined using AND. If there are no PERMISSIVE policies, then
       access is denied.

       Note that, for the purposes of combining multiple policies, ALL policies are treated as having the same
       type as whichever other type of policy is being applied.

       For example, in an UPDATE command requiring both SELECT and UPDATE permissions, if there are multiple
       applicable policies of each type, they will be combined as follows:

           <u>expression</u> from RESTRICTIVE SELECT/ALL policy 1
           AND
           <u>expression</u> from RESTRICTIVE SELECT/ALL policy 2
           AND
           ...
           AND
           (
             <u>expression</u> from PERMISSIVE SELECT/ALL policy 1
             OR
             <u>expression</u> from PERMISSIVE SELECT/ALL policy 2
             OR
             ...
           )
           AND
           <u>expression</u> from RESTRICTIVE UPDATE/ALL policy 1
           AND
           <u>expression</u> from RESTRICTIVE UPDATE/ALL policy 2
           AND
           ...
           AND
           (
             <u>expression</u> from PERMISSIVE UPDATE/ALL policy 1
             OR
             <u>expression</u> from PERMISSIVE UPDATE/ALL policy 2
             OR
             ...
           )

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       You must be the owner of a table to create or change policies for it.

       While policies will be applied for explicit queries against tables in the database, they are not applied
       when the system is performing internal referential integrity checks or validating constraints. This means
       there are indirect ways to determine that a given value exists. An example of this is attempting to
       insert a duplicate value into a column that is a primary key or has a unique constraint. If the insert
       fails then the user can infer that the value already exists. (This example assumes that the user is
       permitted by policy to insert records which they are not allowed to see.) Another example is where a user
       is allowed to insert into a table which references another, otherwise hidden table. Existence can be
       determined by the user inserting values into the referencing table, where success would indicate that the
       value exists in the referenced table. These issues can be addressed by carefully crafting policies to
       prevent users from being able to insert, delete, or update records at all which might possibly indicate a
       value they are not otherwise able to see, or by using generated values (e.g., surrogate keys) instead of
       keys with external meanings.

       Generally, the system will enforce filter conditions imposed using security policies prior to
       qualifications that appear in user queries, in order to prevent inadvertent exposure of the protected
       data to user-defined functions which might not be trustworthy. However, functions and operators marked by
       the system (or the system administrator) as LEAKPROOF may be evaluated before policy expressions, as they
       are assumed to be trustworthy.

       Since policy expressions are added to the user's query directly, they will be run with the rights of the
       user running the overall query. Therefore, users who are using a given policy must be able to access any
       tables or functions referenced in the expression or they will simply receive a permission denied error
       when attempting to query the table that has row-level security enabled. This does not change how views
       work, however. As with normal queries and views, permission checks and policies for the tables which are
       referenced by a view will use the view owner's rights and any policies which apply to the view owner,
       except if the view is defined using the security_invoker option (see <b>CREATE</b> <b>VIEW</b>).

       No separate policy exists for <b>MERGE</b>. Instead, the policies defined for <b>SELECT</b>, <b>INSERT</b>, <b>UPDATE</b>, and <b>DELETE</b>
       are applied while executing <b>MERGE</b>, depending on the actions that are performed.

       Additional discussion and practical examples can be found in Section 5.9.
