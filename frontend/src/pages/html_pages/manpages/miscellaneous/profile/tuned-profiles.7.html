       tuned-profiles - description of basic TuneD profiles

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These  are  the  base  profiles  which are mostly shipped in the base tuned package. They are targeted to
       various goals. Mostly they provide performance optimizations but there are also profiles targeted to  low
       power  consumption,  low latency and others. You can mostly deduce the purpose of the profile by its name
       or you can see full description below.

       The profiles are stored in subdirectories below <u>/usr/lib/tuned/profiles/</u>. If you need  to  customize  the
       profiles,  you  can  copy them to <u>/etc/tuned/profiles/</u> and modify them as you need. When loading profiles
       with the same name, <u>/etc/tuned/profiles/</u> takes precedence. In such case you will not lose your customized
       profiles between TuneD updates.

       The power saving profiles contain settings that are  typically  not  enabled  by  default  as  they  will
       noticeably  impact  the latency/performance of your system as opposed to the power saving mechanisms that
       are enabled by default. On the other hand the performance profiles disable the  additional  power  saving
       mechanisms of TuneD as they would negatively impact throughput or latency.

</pre><h4><b>PROFILES</b></h4><pre>
       At the moment we're providing the following pre-defined profiles:

       <b>balanced</b>
              It  is  the  default profile. It provides balanced power saving and performance.  At the moment it
              enables CPU and disk plugins of TuneD and it makes sure the conservative governor  is  active  (if
              supported by the current cpufreq driver).  It enables ALPM power saving for SATA host adapters and
              sets  the  link  power  management policy to medium_power. It also sets the CPU energy performance
              bias to normal. It also enables AC97 audio power saving or (it depends on your  system)  HDA-Intel
              power savings with 10 seconds timeout. In case your system contains supported Radeon graphics card
              (with enabled KMS) it configures it to automatic power saving.

       <b>balanced-battery</b>
              Profile  mainly  used  by  tuned-ppd if balanced profile is requested and machine runs on battery.
              It's  based  on  the  balanced  profile.  It  additionaly  sets  energy_performance_preference  to
              balance_power, enables amd-pstate core performance boost, and enables video panel_power_savings.

       <b>powersave</b>
              Maximal  power  saving,  at  the  moment  it enables USB autosuspend (in case environment variable
              USB_AUTOSUSPEND is set to 1), enables ALPM power saving for SATA host adapters and sets  the  link
              power  management  policy  to  min_power.   It  also  enables WiFi power saving and makes sure the
              ondemand governor is active (if supported by the current cpufreq driver). It sets the  CPU  energy
              performance  bias  to  powersave.  It  also enables AC97 audio power saving or (it depends on your
              system) HDA-Intel power savings (with 10 seconds timeout). In case your system contains  supported
              Radeon  graphics  card  (with enabled KMS) it configures it to automatic power saving. On Asus Eee
              PCs dynamic Super Hybrid Engine is enabled.

       <b>throughput-performance</b>
              Profile for typical throughput performance tuning. Disables power saving  mechanisms  and  enables
              sysctl  settings that improve the throughput performance of your disk and network IO. CPU governor
              is set to performance and CPU energy performance bias is set to performance. Disk readahead values
              are increased.

       <b>accelerator-performance</b>
              This profile contains the same tuning as the  throughput-performance  profile.   Additionally,  it
              locks  the  CPU  to  low  C  states  so  that  the  latency  is less than 100us. This improves the
              performance of certain accelerators, such as GPUs.

       <b>latency-performance</b>
              Profile for low latency performance tuning. Disables power saving mechanisms.  CPU governor is set
              to performance and locked to the low C states  (by  PM  QoS).   CPU  energy  performance  bias  to
              performance.

       <b>network-throughput</b>
              Profile  for  throughput  network  tuning.  It  is based on the throughput-performance profile. It
              additionally increases kernel network buffers.

       <b>network-latency</b>
              Profile for low latency network tuning.  It  is  based  on  the  latency-performance  profile.  It
              additionally  disables  transparent  hugepages,  NUMA  balancing  and  tunes several other network
              related sysctl parameters.

       <b>desktop</b>
              Profile optimized for desktops based  on  balanced  profile.  It  additionally  enables  scheduler
              autogroups for better response of interactive applications.

       <b>hpc-compute</b>
              Profile optimized for high-performance computing. It is based on the latency-performance profile.

       <b>virtual-guest</b>
              Profile  optimized  for  virtual  guests based on throughput-performance profile.  It additionally
              decreases virtual memory swappiness and increases dirty_ratio settings.

       <b>virtual-host</b>
              Profile optimized for virtual hosts based  on  throughput-performance  profile.   It  additionally
              enables more aggressive writeback of dirty pages.

       <b>intel-sst</b>
              Profile optimized for systems with user-defined Intel Speed Select Technology configurations. This
              profile  is  intended  to be used as an overlay on other profiles (e.g. cpu-partitioning profile),
              example: <b>tuned-adm</b> <b>profile</b> <b>cpu-partitioning</b> <b>intel-sst</b>

       <b>optimize-serial-console</b>
              Profile which tunes down I/O activity to the serial console by reducing  the  printk  value.  This
              should make the serial console more responsive.  This profile is intended to be used as an overlay
              on   other   profiles   (e.g.   throughput-performance   profile),   example:   <b>tuned-adm</b>  <b>profile</b>
              <b>throughput-performance</b> <b>optimize-serial-console</b>

       <b>aws</b>    Profile optimized for AWS EC2 instances. It is based on the throughput-performance profile.
