</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       check_email_delivery - sends email and verifies delivery

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        check_email_delivery -vV
        check_email_delivery --usage
        check_email_delivery --help

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --warning &lt;seconds&gt;[,&lt;smtp_seconds&gt;,&lt;imap_seconds&gt;]
           Exit with WARNING if the most recent email found is older than &lt;seconds&gt;. The optional &lt;smtp_seconds&gt;
           and  &lt;imap_seconds&gt;  parameters  will  be  passed  on to the included plugins that are used for those
           tasks. If they are not given then they will not be passed on and the default  for  that  plugin  will
           apply.  Also known as: -w &lt;seconds&gt;[,&lt;send&gt;[,&lt;recv&gt;]]

           When  using  the --plugin option, only one parameter is supported (-w &lt;seconds&gt;) and it will apply to
           the entire process. You can specify a warning threshold specific to each plugin in the plugin command
           line.

           When using the --plugin option, no measuring of "most recent email" is done because we would not know
           how to read this information from receive plugins. This may be addressed in future versions.

       --critical &lt;seconds&gt;[,&lt;smtp_seconds&gt;,&lt;imap_seconds&gt;]
           Exit  with  CRITICAL  if  the  most  recent  email  found  is  older  than  &lt;seconds&gt;.  The  optional
           &lt;smtp_seconds&gt;  and &lt;imap_seconds&gt; parameters will be passed on to the included plugins that are used
           for those tasks. If they are not given then they will not be passed  on  and  the  default  for  that
           plugin will apply.  Also known as: -c &lt;seconds&gt;[,&lt;send&gt;[,&lt;recv&gt;]]

           When  using  the --plugin option, only one parameter is supported (-c &lt;seconds&gt;) and it will apply to
           the entire process. You can specify a critical threshold  specific  to  each  plugin  in  the  plugin
           command line.

           When using the --plugin option, no measuring of "most recent email" is done because we would not know
           how to read this information from receive plugins. This may be addressed in future versions.

       --timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
       --timeout &lt;smtp_seconds&gt;,&lt;imap_seconds&gt;
       --timeout &lt;plugin1_seconds&gt;,&lt;plugin2_seconds&gt;,...
           Exit  with  CRITICAL  if  the  plugins do not return a status within the specified number of seconds.
           When only one parameter is used, it applies  to  each  plugin.  When  multiple  parameters  are  used
           (separated  by  commas)  they  apply  to  plugins in the same order the plugins were specified on the
           command line. When using  --timeout  but  not  the  --plugin  option,  the  first  parameter  is  for
           check_smtp_send and the second is for check_imap_receive.

       --alert &lt;pluginN&gt;
           Exit with WARNING or CRITICAL only if a warning or error (--warning, --critical, or --timeout) occurs
           for  specified  plugins.  If  a warning or error occurs for non-specified plugins that run BEFORE the
           specified plugins, the exit status will be UNKNOWN.  If a warning of error occurs  for  non-specified
           plugins that run AFTER the specified plugins, the exit status will not be affected.

           You  would  use  this  option  if you are using check_email_delivery with the --plugin option and the
           plugins you configure each use different servers, for example different SMTP and  IMAP  servers.   By
           default,  if  you  do  not  use  the --alert option, if anything goes wrong during the email delivery
           check, a WARNING or CRITICAL alert will be issued. This means that if you define check_email_delivery
           for the SMTP server only and the IMAP server fails, Nagios will alert you for the SMTP  server  which
           would  be  misleading. If you define it for both the SMTP server and IMAP server and just one of them
           fails, Nagios will alert you for both servers, which would still be misleading.   If  you  have  this
           situation, you may want to use the --alert option. You define the check_email_delivery check for both
           servers:   for  the SMTP server (first plugin) you use --alert 1, and for for the IMAP server (second
           plugin) you use --alert 2. When check_email_delivery runs with --alert 1 and the SMTP  server  fails,
           you  will  get  the  appropriate  alert. If the IMAP server fails it will not affect the status. When
           check_email_delivery runs with --alert 2 and the SMTP server fails, you will get the  UNKNOWN  return
           code. If the IMAP server generates an alert you will get a WARNING or CRITICAL as appropriate.

           You  can  repeat  this option to specify multiple plugins that should cause an alert.  Do this if you
           have multiple plugins on the command line but some of them involve the same server.

           See also: --plugin.  Also known as: -A &lt;pluginN&gt;

       --wait &lt;seconds&gt;[,&lt;seconds&gt;,...]
           How long to wait between sending the message and checking that it was received. View default with the
           -vV option.

           When using the --plugin option, you can specify as many wait-between times as you have plugins (minus
           the last plugin, because it makes no sense to wait after running the last one). For example,  if  you
           use  the  --plugin  option twice to specify an SMTP plugin and an IMAP plugin, and you want to wait 5
           seconds between sending and receiving, then you would specify --wait 5. A second example, if you  are
           using  the  --plugin  option three times, then specifying -w 5 will wait 5 seconds between the second
           and third plugins also. You can specify a different wait time of 10 seconds between  the  second  and
           third plugins, like this:  -w 5,10.

       --hostname &lt;server&gt;
           Address  or  name  of  the SMTP and IMAP server. Examples: mail.server.com, localhost, 192.168.1.100.
           Also known as: -H &lt;server&gt;

       --smtp-server &lt;server&gt;
           Address or name of the SMTP server. Examples: smtp.server.com, localhost, 192.168.1.100.  Using  this
           option overrides the hostname option.

       --smtp-port &lt;number&gt;
           Service port on the SMTP server. Default is 25.

       --smtp-username &lt;username&gt;
       --smtp-password &lt;password&gt;
           Username  and  password  to  use  when  connecting to the SMTP server with the TLS option.  Use these
           options if the SMTP account has a different username/password than the IMAP account you are  testing.
           These options take precendence over the --username and the --password options.

           These are shell-escaped; special characters are ok.

       --imap-server &lt;server&gt;
           Address  or name of the IMAP server. Examples: imap.server.com, localhost, 192.168.1.100.  Using this
           option overrides the hostname option.

       --imap-port &lt;number&gt;
           Service port on the IMAP server. Default is 143. If you use SSL the default is 993.

       --imap-username &lt;username&gt;
       --imap-password &lt;password&gt;
           Username and password to use when connecting to the IMAP server.   Use  these  options  if  the  IMAP
           account  has  a different username/password than the SMTP account you are testing. These options take
           precendence over the --username and the --password options.

           These are shell-escaped; special characters are ok.

       --username &lt;username&gt;
       --password &lt;password&gt;
           Username and password to use when connecting to  IMAP  server.   Also  known  as:  -U  &lt;username&gt;  -P
           &lt;password&gt;

           Also  used  as  the  username  and  password  for  SMTP when the TLS option is enabled.  To specify a
           separate  set  of  credentials  for  SMTP  authentication,  see  the  options   --smtp-username   and
           --smtp-password.

       --imap-check-interval &lt;seconds&gt;
           How long to wait between polls of the imap-server for the specified mail. Default is 5 seconds.

       --imap-retries &lt;times&gt;
           How many times to poll the imap-server for the mail, before we give up. Default is 10.

       --body &lt;message&gt;
           Use this option to specify the body of the email message.

       --header &lt;header&gt;
           Use this option to set an arbitrary header in the message. You can use it multiple times.

       --mailto <a href="mailto:recipient@your.net">recipient@your.net</a>
           You  can  send  a  message to multiple recipients by repeating this option or by separating the email
           addresses with commas (no whitespace allowed):

           $ check_email_delivery ... --mailto <a href="mailto:recipient@your.net">recipient@your.net</a>,<a href="mailto:recipient2@your.net">recipient2@your.net</a> --mailfrom <a href="mailto:sender@your.net">sender@your.net</a>

           This argument is shell-escaped; special characters or angle brackets around the address are ok.

       --mailfrom <a href="mailto:sender@your.net">sender@your.net</a>
           Use this option to set the "from" address in the email.

       --imapssl =item --noimapssl
           Use this to enable or disable SSL for the IMAP plugin.

           This argument is shell-escaped; special characters or angle brackets around the address are ok.

       --smtptls =item --nosmtptls
           Use this to enable or disable TLS/AUTH for the SMTP plugin.

       --libexec
           Use  this  option  to  set  the  path   of   the   Nagios   libexec   directory.   The   default   is
           /usr/local/nagios/libexec.  This  is  where  this  plugin looks for the SMTP and IMAP plugins that it
           depends on.

       --plugin &lt;command&gt;
           This is a new option introduced in version 0.5 of the  check_email_delivery  plugin.   It  frees  the
           plugin  from  depending  on specific external plugins and generalizes the work done to determine that
           the email loop is operational. When using the --plugin option, the  following  options  are  ignored:
           libexec,  imapssl,  smtptls,  hostname,  username,  password,  smtp*,  imap*, mailto, mailfrom, body,
           header, search.

           Use this option multiple times to specify the complete trip. Typically, you would use this  twice  to
           specify plugins for SMTP and IMAP, or SMTP and POP3.

           The output will be success if all the plugins return success. Each plugin should be a standard Nagios
           plugin.

           A  random  token  will  be automatically generated and passed to each plugin specified on the command
           line by substituting the string %TOKEN1%.

           Example usage:

            command_name check_email_delivery
            command_line check_email_delivery
            --plugin "$USER1$/check_smtp_send -H $ARG1$ --mailto <a href="mailto:recipient@your.net">recipient@your.net</a> --mailfrom <a href="mailto:sender@your.net">sender@your.net</a> --header 'Subject: Nagios Test %TOKEN1%.'"
            --plugin "$USER1$/check_imap_receive -H $ARG1$ -U $ARG1$ -P $ARG2$ -s SUBJECT -s 'Nagios Test %TOKEN1%.'"

           This technique allows for a lot of flexibility in configuring the plugins that test each part of your
           email delivery loop.

           See also: --token.  Also known as: -p &lt;command&gt;

       --token &lt;format&gt;
           This is a new option introduced in version 0.5 of the check_email_delivery plugin.  It can be used in
           conjunction with --plugin to control the tokens that are generated and passed to  the  plugins,  like
           %TOKEN1%.

           Use  this  option  multiple  times  to specify formats for different tokens. For example, if you want
           %TOKEN1% to consist of only alphabetical characters but want %TOKEN2% to consist of only digits, then
           you might use these options: --token aaaaaa --token nnnnn

           Any tokens used in your plugin commands that have not been specified by --token &lt;format&gt; will default
           to --token U-X-Y

           Token formats: a - alpha character (a-z) n - numeric  character  (0-9)  c  -  alphanumeric  character
           (a-z0-9)  h  -  hexadecimal character (0-9a-f) U - unix time, seconds from epoch. eg 1193012441 X - a
           word from the pgp even list. eg aardvark Y - a word from the pgp odd list. eg adroitness

           Caution: It has been observed that some IMAP servers do not handle underscores  well  in  the  search
           criteria. For best results, avoid using underscores in your tokens. Use hyphens or commas instead.

           See also: --plugin.  Also known as: -T &lt;format&gt;

           The PGP word list was obtained from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGP_word_list">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGP_word_list</a>

       --file &lt;file&gt;
           Save (append) status information into the given tab-delimited file. Format used:

            token  start-time      end-time        status  plugin-num      output

           Note: format may change in future versions and may become configurable.

           This option available as of version 0.6.2.

           Also known as: -F &lt;file&gt;

       --hires
           Use the Time::HiRes module to measure time, if available.

       --verbose
           Display  additional  information.  Useful for troubleshooting. Use together with --version to see the
           default warning and critical timeout values.  Also known as: -v

       --version
           Display plugin version and exit.  Also known as: -V

       --help
           Display this documentation and exit. Does not work in the ePN version.  Also known as: -h

       --usage
           Display a short usage instruction and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Send</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>with</b> <b>custom</b> <b>headers</b>
       $  check_email_delivery  -H  mail.server.net  --mailto  <a href="mailto:recipient@your.net">recipient@your.net</a>   --mailfrom   <a href="mailto:sender@your.net">sender@your.net</a>
       --username recipient --password secret

       EMAIL DELIVERY OK - 1 seconds

   <b>Set</b> <b>warning</b> <b>and</b> <b>critical</b> <b>timeouts</b> <b>for</b> <b>receive</b> <b>plugin</b> <b>only:</b>
       $   check_email_delivery   -H  mail.server.net  --mailto  <a href="mailto:recipient@your.net">recipient@your.net</a>  --mailfrom  <a href="mailto:sender@your.net">sender@your.net</a>
       --username recipient --password secret -w ,,5 -c ,,15

       EMAIL DELIVERY OK - 1 seconds

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       Complies with the Nagios plug-in specification:
        0         OK             The plugin was able to check the service and  it  appeared  to  be  functioning
       properly
        1         Warning        The  plugin  was  able  to  check the service, but it appeared to be above some
       "warning" threshold or did not appear to be working properly
        2         Critical  The plugin detected that either the service was not running or  it  was  above  some
       "critical" threshold
        3         Unknown        Invalid  command  line  arguments were supplied to the plugin or the plugin was
       unable to check the status of the given hosts/service

</pre><h4><b>NAGIOS</b> <b>PLUGIN</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Nagios plugin reference: <a href="http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/developer-guidelines.html">http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/developer-guidelines.html</a>

       This plugin does NOT use Nagios DEFAULT_SOCKET_TIMEOUT (provided by utils.pm  as  $TIMEOUT)  because  the
       path to utils.pm must be specified completely in this program and forces users to edit the source code if
       their  install  location  is  different  (if  they realize this is the problem). You can view the default
       timeout for this module by using the --verbose and --version options together.  The short form is -vV.

       Other than that, it attempts to follow published guidelines for Nagios plugins.
