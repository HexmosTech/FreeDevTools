</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Cluster options used by Pacemaker's controller

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dc-version</b> = string
           Pacemaker version on cluster node elected Designated Controller (DC)

           Includes a hash which identifies the exact revision the code was built from. Used for diagnostic
           purposes.

       <b>cluster-infrastructure</b> = string
           The messaging layer on which Pacemaker is currently running

           Used for informational and diagnostic purposes.

       <b>cluster-name</b> = string
           An arbitrary name for the cluster

           This optional value is mostly for users' convenience as desired in administration, but may also be
           used in Pacemaker configuration rules via the #cluster-name node attribute, and by higher-level tools
           and resource agents.

       <b>dc-deadtime</b> = time [20s]
           How long to wait for a response from other nodes during start-up

           The optimal value will depend on the speed and load of your network and the type of switches used.

       <b>cluster-recheck-interval</b> = time [15min]
           Polling interval to recheck cluster state and evaluate rules with date specifications

           Pacemaker is primarily event-driven, and looks ahead to know when to recheck cluster state for
           failure-timeout settings and most time-based rules. However, it will also recheck the cluster after
           this amount of inactivity, to evaluate rules with date specifications and serve as a fail-safe for
           certain types of scheduler bugs. A value of 0 disables polling. A positive value sets an interval in
           seconds, unless other units are specified (for example, "5min").

       <b>fence-reaction</b> = select [stop]
           How a cluster node should react if notified of its own fencing

           A cluster node may receive notification of a "succeeded" fencing that targeted it if fencing is
           misconfigured, or if fabric fencing is in use that doesn't cut cluster communication. Use "stop" to
           attempt to immediately stop Pacemaker and stay stopped, or "panic" to attempt to immediately reboot
           the local node, falling back to stop on failure. Allowed values: stop, panic

       <b>election-timeout</b> = time [2min]
           *** Advanced Use Only ***

           Declare an election failed if it is not decided within this much time. If you need to adjust this
           value, it probably indicates the presence of a bug.

       <b>shutdown-escalation</b> = time [20min]
           *** Advanced Use Only ***

           Exit immediately if shutdown does not complete within this much time. If you need to adjust this
           value, it probably indicates the presence of a bug.

       <b>join-integration-timeout</b> = time [3min]
           *** Advanced Use Only ***

           If you need to adjust this value, it probably indicates the presence of a bug.

       <b>join-finalization-timeout</b> = time [30min]
           *** Advanced Use Only ***

           If you need to adjust this value, it probably indicates the presence of a bug.

       <b>transition-delay</b> = time [0s]
           *** Advanced Use Only *** Enabling this option will slow down cluster recovery under all conditions

           Delay cluster recovery for this much time to allow for additional events to occur. Useful if your
           configuration is sensitive to the order in which ping updates arrive.

       <b>stonith-watchdog-timeout</b> = time [0]
           How long before nodes can be assumed to be safely down when watchdog-based self-fencing via SBD is in
           use

           If this is set to a positive value, lost nodes are assumed to achieve self-fencing using
           watchdog-based SBD within this much time. This does not require a fencing resource to be explicitly
           configured, though a fence_watchdog resource can be configured, to limit use to specific nodes. If
           this is set to 0 (the default), the cluster will never assume watchdog-based self-fencing. If this is
           set to a negative value, the cluster will use twice the local value of the `SBD_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT`
           environment variable if that is positive, or otherwise treat this as 0. WARNING: When used, this
           timeout must be larger than `SBD_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT` on all nodes that use watchdog-based SBD, and
           Pacemaker will refuse to start on any of those nodes where this is not true for the local value or
           SBD is not active. When this is set to a negative value, `SBD_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT` must be set to the
           same value on all nodes that use SBD, otherwise data corruption or loss could occur.

       <b>stonith-max-attempts</b> = integer [10]
           How many times fencing can fail before it will no longer be immediately re-attempted on a target

       <b>load-threshold</b> = percentage [80%]
           Maximum amount of system load that should be used by cluster nodes

           The cluster will slow down its recovery process when the amount of system resources used (currently
           CPU) approaches this limit

       <b>node-action-limit</b> = integer [0]
           Maximum number of jobs that can be scheduled per node (defaults to 2x cores)
