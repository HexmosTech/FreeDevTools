       ATF — introduction to the Automated Testing Framework

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Automated  Testing  Framework  (<b>ATF</b>)  is  a  <u>collection</u> <u>of</u> <u>libraries</u> to implement test programs in a
       variety of languages.  These libraries all offer similar functionality and any test program written  with
       them exposes a consistent user interface.

       Test  programs  using  the  <b>ATF</b>  libraries  rely  on  a  separate  runtime  engine  to  execute them in a
       deterministic fashion.  The runtime engine isolates the test programs from the rest  of  the  system  and
       ensures  some  common  side-effects are cleaned up.  The runtime engine is also responsible for gathering
       the results of all tests and composing reports.  The current runtime of  choice  is  Kyua,  described  in
       <u><a href="../man1/kyua.1.html">kyua</a></u>(1).

       If  your  operating systems distributes <b>ATF</b>, it should also provide an introductory <u><a href="../man7/tests.7.html">tests</a></u>(7) manual page.
       You are encouraged to read it now.

       The rest of this manual page serves as a cross-reference to all the other documentation shipped with <b>ATF</b>.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ATF</b> started as a Google Summer of Code 2007 project mentored by The NetBSD Foundation.  Its original goal
       was to provide a testing framework for the NetBSD operating system, but it grew as an independent project
       because the framework itself did not need to be tied to a specific operating system.

       Originally,  <b>ATF</b>  shipped  the collection of libraries described in this manual page as well as a runtime
       engine.  The runtime engine has since been replaced by Kyua and the old tools were removed in <b>0.20</b>, which
       shipped in early 2014.

       As of late 2014, both FreeBSD and NetBSD ship <b>ATF</b> in their base systems and provide extensive test suites
       based on it.
