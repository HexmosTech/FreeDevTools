</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>oss_usb</b> - USB Audio/MIDI/Mixer driver

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Open Sound System driver for USB Audio and MIDI devices.

       AUDIO The Audio driver supports:

              •  8-96Khz Playback/Recording

              •  8 or 16 or 32 bits

              •  2, 4, 6 or 8 channel audio.

              •  SPDIF digital output and Input

              •  AC3 passthrough

              •  Volume control and device input mixer

       MIDI  The  oss_usb  driver  supports  all  MIDI  devices  that  are compatible with the official USB MIDI
       specification. In addition the driver supports few devices that use their own private protocol (including
       some Yamaha and Midiman models).

        USB MIXER
         The USB Audio mixer is a new type of mixer that doesn't have
         the normal volume controls found on AC97 or Legacy SB devices.
         The USB audio mixer provides control for selecting the Alternate
         device setting - this usually allows the device to be switched
         into a Professional audio mode (eg 24bit or 96Khz mode)

        ALTERNATIVE SETTINGS
         Some USB audio devices use a feature called as alternative settings for
         bandwidth management. Typically such devices have multiple high speed
         inputs and outputs that may require more bandwidth than provided by the USB
         bus. The alternative settings feature is used to select between multiple
         low speed devices or just few high speed devices.

         When the device has multiple alternative settings an "altsetting" selector
         will be visible in the control panel for the device (use <a href="../man1/ossmix.1.html">ossmix</a>(1) or
         <a href="../man1/ossxmix.1.html">ossxmix</a>(1) to change it). Alternative setting OFF means that all
         audio devices are disabled. The other settings provide different combinations
         of high/medium speed devices. You can use the <a href="../man1/ossinfo.1.html">ossinfo</a>(1) command
         (ossinfo -a -v3) to find out the devices supported by the currently selected
         alternative settings and the capabilities of them.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Under Linux it is necessary to run the ossdetect <b>-d</b> and ossdevlinks commands after an USB device has been
       hot-plugged. Alternatively you can execute soundoff and soundon to reload OSS.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/oss4/conf/oss_usb.conf</b>
              Device configuration file.
