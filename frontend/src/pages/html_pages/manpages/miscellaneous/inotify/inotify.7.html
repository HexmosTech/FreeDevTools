       inotify - monitoring filesystem events

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>inotify</u>  API  provides a mechanism for monitoring filesystem events.  Inotify can be used to monitor
       individual files, or to monitor directories.  When a directory is monitored, inotify will  return  events
       for the directory itself, and for files inside the directory.

       The following system calls are used with this API:

       •  <b><a href="../man2/inotify_init.2.html">inotify_init</a></b>(2)  creates  an  inotify  instance and returns a file descriptor referring to the inotify
          instance.  The more recent <b><a href="../man2/inotify_init1.2.html">inotify_init1</a></b>(2) is like <b><a href="../man2/inotify_init.2.html">inotify_init</a></b>(2), but has  a  <u>flags</u>  argument  that
          provides access to some extra functionality.

       •  <b><a href="../man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch</a></b>(2)  manipulates  the  "watch  list"  associated with an inotify instance.  Each item
          ("watch") in the watch list specifies the pathname of a file or directory,  along  with  some  set  of
          events that the kernel should monitor for the file referred to by that pathname.  <b><a href="../man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch</a></b>(2)
          either  creates  a  new  watch  item,  or  modifies an existing watch.  Each watch has a unique "watch
          descriptor", an integer returned by <b><a href="../man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch</a></b>(2) when the watch is created.

       •  When events occur for monitored files  and  directories,  those  events  are  made  available  to  the
          application  as  structured  data that can be read from the inotify file descriptor using <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2) (see
          below).

       •  <b><a href="../man2/inotify_rm_watch.2.html">inotify_rm_watch</a></b>(2) removes an item from an inotify watch list.

       •  When all file descriptors referring to an inotify instance have  been  closed  (using  <b><a href="../man2/close.2.html">close</a></b>(2)),  the
          underlying  object  and  its  resources  are freed for reuse by the kernel; all associated watches are
          automatically freed.

       With careful programming, an application can use inotify to efficiently monitor and cache the state of  a
       set  of  filesystem  objects.   However,  robust  applications should allow for the fact that bugs in the
       monitoring logic or races of the  kind  described  below  may  leave  the  cache  inconsistent  with  the
       filesystem  state.   It  is  probably  wise  to  do some consistency checking, and rebuild the cache when
       inconsistencies are detected.

   <b>Reading</b> <b>events</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>inotify</b> <b>file</b> <b>descriptor</b>
       To determine what events have occurred, an application <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2)s from the inotify file descriptor.  If  no
       events have so far occurred, then, assuming a blocking file descriptor, <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2) will block until at least
       one  event occurs (unless interrupted by a signal, in which case the call fails with the error <b>EINTR</b>; see
       <b><a href="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</a></b>(7)).

       Each successful <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2) returns a buffer containing one or more of the following structures:

           struct inotify_event {
               int      wd;       /* Watch descriptor */
               uint32_t mask;     /* Mask describing event */
               uint32_t cookie;   /* Unique cookie associating related
                                     events (for <a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a>(2)) */
               uint32_t len;      /* Size of <u>name</u> field */
               char     name[];   /* Optional null-terminated name */
           };

       <u>wd</u> identifies the watch for which this event occurs.  It is one of the watch descriptors  returned  by  a
       previous call to <b><a href="../man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch</a></b>(2).

       <u>mask</u> contains bits that describe the event that occurred (see below).

       <u>cookie</u> is a unique integer that connects related events.  Currently, this is used only for rename events,
       and allows the resulting pair of <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> and <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> events to be connected by the application.
       For all other event types, <u>cookie</u> is set to 0.

       The  <u>name</u>  field  is  present  only  when  an event is returned for a file inside a watched directory; it
       identifies the filename within the watched directory.  This filename is null-terminated, and may  include
       further null bytes ('\0') to align subsequent reads to a suitable address boundary.

       The <u>len</u> field counts all of the bytes in <u>name</u>, including the null bytes; the length of each <u>inotify_event</u>
       structure is thus <u>sizeof(struct</u> <u>inotify_event)+len</u>.

       The  behavior  when  the  buffer given to <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2) is too small to return information about the next event
       depends on the kernel version: before Linux 2.6.21, <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2) returns 0; since Linux 2.6.21, <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2)  fails
       with the error <b>EINVAL</b>.  Specifying a buffer of size

           sizeof(struct inotify_event) + NAME_MAX + 1

       will be sufficient to read at least one event.

   <b>inotify</b> <b>events</b>
       The  <b><a href="../man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch</a></b>(2)  <u>mask</u>  argument and the <u>mask</u> field of the <u>inotify_event</u> structure returned when
       <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2)ing an inotify file descriptor are both bit masks identifying inotify events.  The following  bits
       can be specified in <u>mask</u> when calling <b><a href="../man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch</a></b>(2) and may be returned in the <u>mask</u> field returned
       by <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2):

           <b>IN_ACCESS</b> (+)
                  File was accessed (e.g., <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></b>(2)).

           <b>IN_ATTRIB</b> (*)
                  Metadata  changed—for  example, permissions (e.g., <b><a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</a></b>(2)), timestamps (e.g., <b><a href="../man2/utimensat.2.html">utimensat</a></b>(2)),
                  extended attributes (<b><a href="../man2/setxattr.2.html">setxattr</a></b>(2)), link count (since Linux 2.6.25; e.g.,  for  the  target  of
                  <b><a href="../man2/link.2.html">link</a></b>(2) and for <b><a href="../man2/unlink.2.html">unlink</a></b>(2)), and user/group ID (e.g., <b><a href="../man2/chown.2.html">chown</a></b>(2)).

           <b>IN_CLOSE_WRITE</b> (+)
                  File opened for writing was closed.

           <b>IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE</b> (*)
                  File or directory not opened for writing was closed.

           <b>IN_CREATE</b> (+)
                  File/directory  created  in  watched  directory  (e.g.,  <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2)  <b>O_CREAT</b>,  <b><a href="../man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/link.2.html">link</a></b>(2),
                  <b><a href="../man2/symlink.2.html">symlink</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2) on a UNIX domain socket).

           <b>IN_DELETE</b> (+)
                  File/directory deleted from watched directory.

           <b>IN_DELETE_SELF</b>
                  Watched file/directory was itself deleted.  (This event also occurs if an object is  moved  to
                  another  filesystem,  since  <b><a href="../man1/mv.1.html">mv</a></b>(1)  in effect copies the file to the other filesystem and then
                  deletes it from the original filesystem.)  In addition, an <b>IN_IGNORED</b> event will  subsequently
                  be generated for the watch descriptor.

           <b>IN_MODIFY</b> (+)
                  File was modified (e.g., <b><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/truncate.2.html">truncate</a></b>(2)).

           <b>IN_MOVE_SELF</b>
                  Watched file/directory was itself moved.

           <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> (+)
                  Generated for the directory containing the old filename when a file is renamed.

           <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> (+)
                  Generated for the directory containing the new filename when a file is renamed.

           <b>IN_OPEN</b> (*)
                  File or directory was opened.

       Inotify  monitoring  is  inode-based:  when  monitoring  a  file  (but  not when monitoring the directory
       containing a file), an event can be generated for activity on any link to the file  (in  the  same  or  a
       different directory).

       When monitoring a directory:

       •  the  events  marked above with an asterisk (*) can occur both for the directory itself and for objects
          inside the directory; and

       •  the events marked with a plus sign (+) occur only for  objects  inside  the  directory  (not  for  the
          directory itself).

       <u>Note</u>:  when  monitoring a directory, events are not generated for the files inside the directory when the
       events are performed via a pathname (i.e., a link) that lies outside the monitored directory.

       When events are generated for objects inside  a  watched  directory,  the  <u>name</u>  field  in  the  returned
       <u>inotify_event</u> structure identifies the name of the file within the directory.

       The  <b>IN_ALL_EVENTS</b>  macro is defined as a bit mask of all of the above events.  This macro can be used as
       the <u>mask</u> argument when calling <b><a href="../man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch</a></b>(2).

       Two additional convenience macros are defined:

           <b>IN_MOVE</b>
                  Equates to <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> <b>|</b> <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b>.

           <b>IN_CLOSE</b>
                  Equates to <b>IN_CLOSE_WRITE</b> <b>|</b> <b>IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE</b>.

       The following further bits can be specified in <u>mask</u> when calling <b><a href="../man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch</a></b>(2):

           <b>IN_DONT_FOLLOW</b> (since Linux 2.6.15)
                  Don't dereference <u>pathname</u> if it is a symbolic link.

           <b>IN_EXCL_UNLINK</b> (since Linux 2.6.36)
                  By default, when watching events on the children of a  directory,  events  are  generated  for
                  children  even  after  they  have  been unlinked from the directory.  This can result in large
                  numbers of uninteresting events for some applications (e.g., if watching <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>, in  which  many
                  applications  create  temporary  files  whose  names  are  immediately  unlinked).  Specifying
                  <b>IN_EXCL_UNLINK</b> changes the default behavior, so that events are  not  generated  for  children
                  after they have been unlinked from the watched directory.

           <b>IN_MASK_ADD</b>
                  If  a  watch  instance already exists for the filesystem object corresponding to <u>pathname</u>, add
                  (OR) the events in <u>mask</u> to the watch mask (instead of replacing the mask);  the  error  <b>EINVAL</b>
                  results if <b>IN_MASK_CREATE</b> is also specified.

           <b>IN_ONESHOT</b>
                  Monitor  the filesystem object corresponding to <u>pathname</u> for one event, then remove from watch
                  list.

           <b>IN_ONLYDIR</b> (since Linux 2.6.15)
                  Watch <u>pathname</u> only if it is a directory; the error <b>ENOTDIR</b>  results  if  <u>pathname</u>  is  not  a
                  directory.   Using this flag provides an application with a race-free way of ensuring that the
                  monitored object is a directory.

           <b>IN_MASK_CREATE</b> (since Linux 4.18)
                  Watch <u>pathname</u> only if it does not already have a watch associated with it; the  error  <b>EEXIST</b>
                  results if <u>pathname</u> is already being watched.

                  Using  this flag provides an application with a way of ensuring that new watches do not modify
                  existing ones.  This is useful because multiple  paths  may  refer  to  the  same  inode,  and
                  multiple calls to <b><a href="../man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch</a></b>(2) without this flag may clobber existing watch masks.

       The following bits may be set in the <u>mask</u> field returned by <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2):

           <b>IN_IGNORED</b>
                  Watch  was  removed  explicitly  (<b><a href="../man2/inotify_rm_watch.2.html">inotify_rm_watch</a></b>(2))  or automatically (file was deleted, or
                  filesystem was unmounted).  See also BUGS.

           <b>IN_ISDIR</b>
                  Subject of this event is a directory.

           <b>IN_Q_OVERFLOW</b>
                  Event queue overflowed (<u>wd</u> is -1 for this event).

           <b>IN_UNMOUNT</b>
                  Filesystem containing watched object was unmounted.  In addition,  an  <b>IN_IGNORED</b>  event  will
                  subsequently be generated for the watch descriptor.

   <b>Examples</b>
       Suppose  an  application  is  watching  the  directory  <u>dir</u>  and the file <u>dir/myfile</u> for all events.  The
       examples below show some events that will be generated for these two objects.

           fd = open("dir/myfile", O_RDWR);
                  Generates <b>IN_OPEN</b> events for both <u>dir</u> and <u>dir/myfile</u>.

           read(fd, buf, count);
                  Generates <b>IN_ACCESS</b> events for both <u>dir</u> and <u>dir/myfile</u>.

           write(fd, buf, count);
                  Generates <b>IN_MODIFY</b> events for both <u>dir</u> and <u>dir/myfile</u>.

           fchmod(fd, mode);
                  Generates <b>IN_ATTRIB</b> events for both <u>dir</u> and <u>dir/myfile</u>.

           close(fd);
                  Generates <b>IN_CLOSE_WRITE</b> events for both <u>dir</u> and <u>dir/myfile</u>.

       Suppose an application is watching the  directories  <u>dir1</u>  and  <u>dir2</u>,  and  the  file  <u>dir1/myfile</u>.   The
       following examples show some events that may be generated.

           link("dir1/myfile", "dir2/new");
                  Generates an <b>IN_ATTRIB</b> event for <u>myfile</u> and an <b>IN_CREATE</b> event for <u>dir2</u>.

           rename("dir1/myfile", "dir2/myfile");
                  Generates  an <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> event for <u>dir1</u>, an <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> event for <u>dir2</u>, and an <b>IN_MOVE_SELF</b>
                  event for <u>myfile</u>.  The <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> and <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> events will have the same <u>cookie</u> value.

       Suppose that <u>dir1/xx</u> and <u>dir2/yy</u> are (the only) links to the same file, and an  application  is  watching
       <u>dir1</u>,  <u>dir2</u>,  <u>dir1/xx</u>, and <u>dir2/yy</u>.  Executing the following calls in the order given below will generate
       the following events:

           unlink("dir2/yy");
                  Generates an <b>IN_ATTRIB</b> event for <u>xx</u> (because its link count changes) and  an  <b>IN_DELETE</b>  event
                  for <u>dir2</u>.

           unlink("dir1/xx");
                  Generates  <b>IN_ATTRIB</b>, <b>IN_DELETE_SELF</b>, and <b>IN_IGNORED</b> events for <u>xx</u>, and an <b>IN_DELETE</b> event for
                  <u>dir1</u>.

       Suppose an application is watching the directory <u>dir</u> and (the empty) directory <u>dir/subdir</u>.  The following
       examples show some events that may be generated.

           mkdir("dir/new", mode);
                  Generates an <b>IN_CREATE</b> <b>|</b> <b>IN_ISDIR</b> event for <u>dir</u>.

           rmdir("dir/subdir");
                  Generates <b>IN_DELETE_SELF</b> and <b>IN_IGNORED</b> events for <u>subdir</u>, and an <b>IN_DELETE</b> <b>|</b>  <b>IN_ISDIR</b>  event
                  for <u>dir</u>.

   <b><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></b> <b>interfaces</b>
       The following interfaces can be used to limit the amount of kernel memory consumed by inotify:

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events">/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events</a></u>
              The  value in this file is used when an application calls <b><a href="../man2/inotify_init.2.html">inotify_init</a></b>(2) to set an upper limit on
              the number of events that can be queued to the corresponding inotify instance.  Events  in  excess
              of this limit are dropped, but an <b>IN_Q_OVERFLOW</b> event is always generated.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances">/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances</a></u>
              This specifies an upper limit on the number of inotify instances that can be created per real user
              ID.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches">/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches</a></u>
              This specifies an upper limit on the number of watches that can be created per real user ID.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       Linux.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Inotify  was  merged  into  Linux  2.6.13.   The  required  library  interfaces  were added in glibc 2.4.
       (<b>IN_DONT_FOLLOW</b>, <b>IN_MASK_ADD</b>, and <b>IN_ONLYDIR</b> were added in glibc 2.5.)

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Inotify file descriptors can be monitored using <b><a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</a></b>(2),  and  <b><a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll</a></b>(7).   When  an  event  is
       available, the file descriptor indicates as readable.

       Since  Linux  2.6.25,  signal-driven  I/O notification is available for inotify file descriptors; see the
       discussion of <b>F_SETFL</b> (for setting the <b>O_ASYNC</b> flag), <b>F_SETOWN</b>, and <b>F_SETSIG</b> in <b><a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</a></b>(2).  The  <u>siginfo_t</u>
       structure  (described in <b><a href="../man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction</a></b>(2)) that is passed to the signal handler has the following fields set:
       <u>si_fd</u> is set to the inotify file descriptor number; <u>si_signo</u> is set to the signal number; <u>si_code</u> is  set
       to <b>POLL_IN</b>; and <b>POLLIN</b> is set in <u>si_band</u>.

       If successive output inotify events produced on the inotify file descriptor are identical (same <u>wd</u>, <u>mask</u>,
       <u>cookie</u>,  and  <u>name</u>), then they are coalesced into a single event if the older event has not yet been read
       (but see BUGS).  This reduces the amount of kernel memory required for the event queue,  but  also  means
       that an application can't use inotify to reliably count file events.

       The events returned by reading from an inotify file descriptor form an ordered queue.  Thus, for example,
       it is guaranteed that when renaming from one directory to another, events will be produced in the correct
       order on the inotify file descriptor.

       The set of watch descriptors that is being monitored via an inotify file descriptor can be viewed via the
       entry  for  the  inotify  file  descriptor  in the process's <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/fdinfo</u> directory.  See <b><a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</a></b>(5) for
       further details.  The <b>FIONREAD</b> <b><a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</a></b>(2) returns the number of bytes available to  read  from  an  inotify
       file descriptor.

   <b>Limitations</b> <b>and</b> <b>caveats</b>
       The  inotify  API provides no information about the user or process that triggered the inotify event.  In
       particular, there is no easy way for a process that is  monitoring  events  via  inotify  to  distinguish
       events that it triggers itself from those that are triggered by other processes.

       Inotify  reports only events that a user-space program triggers through the filesystem API.  As a result,
       it does not catch remote events that occur on network  filesystems.   (Applications  must  fall  back  to
       polling  the  filesystem  to  catch such events.)  Furthermore, various pseudo-filesystems such as <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u>,
       <u><a href="file:/sys">/sys</a></u>, and <u><a href="file:/dev/pts">/dev/pts</a></u> are not monitorable with inotify.

       The inotify API does not report file accesses and  modifications  that  may  occur  because  of  <b><a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a></b>(2),
       <b><a href="../man2/msync.2.html">msync</a></b>(2), and <b><a href="../man2/munmap.2.html">munmap</a></b>(2).

       The  inotify API identifies affected files by filename.  However, by the time an application processes an
       inotify event, the filename may already have been deleted or renamed.

       The inotify API identifies events via watch descriptors.  It is the application's responsibility to cache
       a mapping (if one is needed) between watch descriptors and pathnames.  Be aware that directory  renamings
       may affect multiple cached pathnames.

       Inotify  monitoring  of  directories  is  not  recursive:  to  monitor  subdirectories under a directory,
       additional watches must be created.  This can take a significant amount time for large directory trees.

       If monitoring an entire directory subtree, and a new subdirectory is created in that tree or an  existing
       directory  is  renamed  into  that  tree,  be  aware  that  by  the  time  you create a watch for the new
       subdirectory, new files (and subdirectories) may already exist inside the subdirectory.   Therefore,  you
       may  want  to  scan the contents of the subdirectory immediately after adding the watch (and, if desired,
       recursively add watches for any subdirectories that it contains).

       Note that the event queue can overflow.  In this case,  events  are  lost.   Robust  applications  should
       handle  the  possibility  of lost events gracefully.  For example, it may be necessary to rebuild part or
       all of the application cache.  (One simple, but possibly expensive, approach is to close the inotify file
       descriptor, empty the cache, create a new inotify file descriptor, and then re-create watches  and  cache
       entries for the objects to be monitored.)

       If  a  filesystem  is  mounted  on top of a monitored directory, no event is generated, and no events are
       generated for objects immediately  under  the  new  mount  point.   If  the  filesystem  is  subsequently
       unmounted, events will subsequently be generated for the directory and the objects it contains.

   <b>Dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>rename()</b> <b>events</b>
       As  noted  above,  the  <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b>  and  <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b>  event pair that is generated by <b><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></b>(2) can be
       matched up via their shared cookie value.  However, the task of matching has some challenges.

       These two events are usually consecutive in the event stream available when reading from the inotify file
       descriptor.  However, this is not guaranteed.  If multiple processes are triggering events for  monitored
       objects,  then  (on  rare  occasions)  an  arbitrary  number  of  other  events  may  appear  between the
       <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> and <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> events.   Furthermore,  it  is  not  guaranteed  that  the  event  pair  is
       atomically  inserted  into the queue: there may be a brief interval where the <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> has appeared,
       but the <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> has not.

       Matching up the <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> and <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> event pair generated by <b><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></b>(2) is thus inherently  racy.
       (Don't  forget  that  if  an object is renamed outside of a monitored directory, there may not even be an
       <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> event.)  Heuristic approaches (e.g., assume the events are always consecutive) can be used to
       ensure a match in most cases, but will inevitably miss some cases, causing the  application  to  perceive
       the  <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> and <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> events as being unrelated.  If watch descriptors are destroyed and re-
       created as a result, then those watch descriptors will be inconsistent with the watch descriptors in  any
       pending  events.  (Re-creating the inotify file descriptor and rebuilding the cache may be useful to deal
       with this scenario.)

       Applications should also allow for the possibility that the <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> event was the last  event  that
       could  fit  in the buffer returned by the current call to <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2), and the accompanying <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> event
       might be fetched only on the next <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2), which should be done with a (small) timeout to allow  for  the
       fact  that  insertion of the <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b>+<b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> event pair is not atomic, and also the possibility
       that there may not be any <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> event.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Before Linux 3.19, <b><a href="../man2/fallocate.2.html">fallocate</a></b>(2)  did  not  create  any  inotify  events.   Since  Linux  3.19,  calls  to
       <b><a href="../man2/fallocate.2.html">fallocate</a></b>(2) generate <b>IN_MODIFY</b> events.

       Before Linux 2.6.16, the <b>IN_ONESHOT</b> <u>mask</u> flag does not work.

       As  originally  designed  and  implemented,  the  <b>IN_ONESHOT</b> flag did not cause an <b>IN_IGNORED</b> event to be
       generated when the watch was dropped after one event.  However, as an unintended effect of other changes,
       since Linux 2.6.36, an <b>IN_IGNORED</b> event is generated in this case.

       Before Linux 2.6.25, the kernel code that was intended to coalesce successive identical events (i.e., the
       two most recent events could potentially be coalesced if the older had not yet been read) instead checked
       if the most recent event could be coalesced with the <u>oldest</u> unread event.

       When a watch descriptor is removed by calling <b><a href="../man2/inotify_rm_watch.2.html">inotify_rm_watch</a></b>(2) (or because a watch file is deleted  or
       the filesystem that contains it is unmounted), any pending unread events for that watch descriptor remain
       available to read.  As watch descriptors are subsequently allocated with <b><a href="../man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch</a></b>(2), the kernel
       cycles  through  the range of possible watch descriptors (1 to <b>INT_MAX</b>) incrementally.  When allocating a
       free watch descriptor, no check is made to see whether that  watch  descriptor  number  has  any  pending
       unread events in the inotify queue.  Thus, it can happen that a watch descriptor is reallocated even when
       pending  unread  events exist for a previous incarnation of that watch descriptor number, with the result
       that the application might then read those events and interpret them as belonging to the file  associated
       with  the  newly  recycled  watch  descriptor.   In  practice,  the likelihood of hitting this bug may be
       extremely low, since it requires that an application cycle through <b>INT_MAX</b> watch descriptors,  release  a
       watch  descriptor  while  leaving  unread events for that watch descriptor in the queue, and then recycle
       that watch descriptor.  For this reason, and because there have been no reports of the bug  occurring  in
       real-world  applications,  as  of  Linux  3.15,  no  kernel  changes have yet been made to eliminate this
       possible bug.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following program demonstrates the usage of the inotify API.  It marks the directories  passed  as  a
       command-line arguments and waits for events of type <b>IN_OPEN</b>, <b>IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE</b>, and <b>IN_CLOSE_WRITE</b>.

       The  following output was recorded while editing the file <u>/home/user/temp/foo</u> and listing directory <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>.
       Before the file and the directory were opened, <b>IN_OPEN</b> events occurred.  After the file  was  closed,  an
       <b>IN_CLOSE_WRITE</b>  event  occurred.   After  the  directory  was closed, an <b>IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE</b> event occurred.
       Execution of the program ended when the user pressed the ENTER key.

   <b>Example</b> <b>output</b>
           $ <b>./a.out</b> <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> <b>/home/user/temp</b>
           Press enter key to terminate.
           Listening for events.
           IN_OPEN: /home/user/temp/foo [file]
           IN_CLOSE_WRITE: /home/user/temp/foo [file]
           IN_OPEN: <a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a> [directory]
           IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE: <a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a> [directory]
