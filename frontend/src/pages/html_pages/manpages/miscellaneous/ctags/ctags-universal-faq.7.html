</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>Universal</b> <b>Ctags</b> <b>and</b> <b>Exuberant</b> <b>Ctags?</b>
       Universal  Ctags  is  an  unofficial  fork  of  Exuberant  Ctags.   The  differences  are  summarized  in
       <a href="../man7/ctags-incompatibilities.7.html">ctags-incompatibilities</a>(7) man page.

       The most notable one is that Universal Ctags doesn't read <b><a href="file:~/.ctags">~/.ctags</a></b> file.  Instead, it reads <b>*.ctags</b> under
       <b><a href="file:~/.ctags.d">~/.ctags.d</a></b> directory.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>specify</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>option</b> <b>every</b> <b>time?</b>
       Either  by  setting  the  environment  variable  <b>CTAGS</b>  to  your  custom  options, or putting them into a
       <b><a href="file:~/.ctags.d/anyname.ctags">~/.ctags.d/anyname.ctags</a></b> file in your home directory.

   <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>strange</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>;"</b> <b>which</b> <b>follow</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> <b>file?</b>
       These are <u>extension</u> <u>flags</u>. They are added in order to provide extra information about the tag that may be
       utilized by the editor in order to more intelligently handle tags. They are appended to  the  EX  command
       part  of  the tag line in a manner that provides backwards compatibility with existing implementations of
       the Vi editor. The semicolon is an EX command separator and the double quote begins an EX comment.  Thus,
       the  extension flags appear as an EX comment and should be ignored by the editor when it processes the EX
       command.

       Some non-vi editors, however, implement only the bare minimum of EX commands  in  order  to  process  the
       search  command or line number in the third field of the tag file. If you encounter this problem, use the
       option <b>--format=1</b> to generate a tag file without these extensions (remember that you can  set  the  CTAGS
       environment  variable  to any default arguments you wish to supply). Then ask the supplier of your editor
       to implement handling of this feature of EX commands.

   <b>Why</b> <b>can't</b> <b>I</b> <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> <b>class::member?</b>
       Because, by default, ctags only generates tags for the separate identifiers found in the source files. If
       you specify the <b>--extra=+q</b> option, then ctags will also generate a second, class-qualified tag  for  each
       class  member  (data and function/method) in the form <b>class::member</b> for C++, and in the form <b>class.method</b>
       for Eiffel and Java.

   <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>line</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tag?</b>
       By default, ctags encodes the line number in the file where macro (<b>#define</b>) tags are found. This was done
       to remain compatible with the original UNIX version of ctags. If you change the file containing  the  tag
       without  rebuilding  the  tag  file,  the location of tag in the tag file may no longer match the current
       location.

       In order to avoid this problem, you can specify the option <b>--excmd=p</b>, which causes ctags to use a  search
       pattern  to  locate  macro  tags. I have never uncovered the reason why the original UNIX ctags used line
       numbers exclusively for macro tags, but have so far resisted changing the default behavior  of  Exuberant
       (and Universal) Ctags to behave differently.

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>name?</b>
       A  tag  file  is  simple  a list of tag names and where to find them. If there are duplicate entries, you
       often end up going to the wrong one because the tag file is sorted and your editor locates the first  one
       in the tag file.

       Standard  Vi  provides  no  facilities  to  alter  this  behavior. However, Vim has some nice features to
       minimize this problem,  primarily  by  examining  all  matches  and  choosing  the  best  one  under  the
       circumstances. Vim also provides commands which allow for selection of the desired matching tag.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>locate</b> <b>all</b> <b>references</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> <b>function</b> <b>or</b> <b>variable?</b>
       There  are  several  packages already available which provide this capability.  Namely, these are: GLOBAL
       source code tag system, GNU id-utils, cscope, and cflow. As of this writing, they can  be  found  in  the
       following locations:

       • GLOBAL:     &lt;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/global">http://www.gnu.org/software/global</a>&gt;

       • id-utils:   &lt;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/idutils/idutils.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/idutils/idutils.html</a>&gt;

       • cscope:     &lt;<a href="http://cscope.sourceforge.net">http://cscope.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;

       • cflow:      &lt;<a href="ftp://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/devel/lang/c">ftp://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/devel/lang/c</a>&gt;

   <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>appending</b> <b>tags</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tag</b> <b>file</b> <b>tag</b> <b>so</b> <b>long?</b>
       Sometimes,  in  an attempt to build a global tag file for all source files in a large source tree of many
       directories, someone will make an attempt to run ctags in append (<b>-a</b>) mode  on  every  directory  in  the
       hierarchy.  Each  time  ctags  is invoked, its default behavior is to sort the tag file once the tags for
       that execution have been added. As the cumulative tag file grows, the sort time increases arithmetically.

       The best way to avoid this problem (and the most efficient) is to make  use  of  the  <b>--recurse</b>  (or  <b>-R</b>)
       option  of  ctags by executing the following command in the root of the directory hierarchy (thus running
       ctags only once):

              ctags -R

       If you really insist on running ctags separately on each directory, you can avoid the sort pass each time
       by specifying the option <b>--sort=no</b>. Once the tag file is  completely  built,  use  the  sort  command  to
       manually sort the final tag file, or let the final invocation of ctags sort the file.

   <b>How</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>tag</b> <b>files</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>multi-level</b> <b>directory</b> <b>hierarchy?</b>
       There are a few ways of approaching this:

       1. A local tag file in each directory containing only the tags for source files in that directory.

       2. One  single  big, global tag file present in the root directory of your hierarchy, containing all tags
          present in all source files in the hierarchy.

       3. A local tag file in each directory containing only the tags for source files  in  that  directory,  in
          addition to one single global tag file present in the root directory of your hierarchy, containing all
          non-static tags present in all source files in the hierarchy.

       4. A  local  tag  file in each directory of the hierarchy, each one containing all tags present in source
          files in that directory and all non-static tags in every directory below it (note  that  this  implies
          also having one big tag file in the root directory of the hierarchy).

       Each  of these approaches has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, depending upon your particular
       conditions. Which approach is deemed best depends upon the following factors:

       A. The ability of your editor to use multiple tag files.

          If your editor cannot make use of multiple tag files (original vi implementations could not), then one
          large tag file is the only way to go if you ever desire to jump to tags located in other  directories.
          If  you never need to jump to tags in another directory (i.e. the source in each directory is entirely
          self-contained), then a local tag file in each directory will fit your needs.

       B. The time is takes for your editor to look up a tag in the tag file.

          The significance of this factor depends upon the size of your source tree and on  whether  the  source
          files  are  located on a local or remote file system. For source and tag files located on a local file
          system, looking up a tag is not as big a hit as one might  first  imagine,  since  vi  implementations
          typically perform a binary search on a sorted tag file. This may or may not be true for the editor you
          use. For files located on a remote file system, reading a large file is an expensive operation.

       C. Whether  or  not  you  expect the source code to change and the time it takes to rebuild a tag file to
          account for changes to the source code.

          While Universal Ctags is particularly fast in scanning  source  code  (around  1-2  MB/sec),  a  large
          project may still result in objectionable delays if one wishes to keep their tag file(s) up to date on
          a frequent basis, or if the files are located on a remote file system.

       D. The presence of duplicate tags in the source code and the ability to handle them.

          The impact of this factor is influenced by the following three issues:

          1. How common are duplicate tags in your project?

          2. Does your editor provide any facilities for dealing with duplicate tags?

             While  standard  vi  does not, many modern vi implementations, such as Vim have good facilities for
             selecting the desired match from the list of duplicates. If your editor does not support  duplicate
             tags,  then  it  will  typically  send  you to only one of them, whether or not that is the one you
             wanted (and not even notifying you that there are other potential matches).

          3. What is the significance of duplicate tags?

             For example, if you have two tags of the same name  from  entirely  isolated  software  components,
             jumping  first  to  the  match  found  in  component B while working in component A may be entirely
             misleading, distracting or inconvenient (to keep having to choose which one if your editor provides
             you with a list of matches).  However, if you have two tags of the same name  for  parallel  builds
             (say two initialization routines for different hosts), you may always want to specify which one you
             want.

       Of  the approaches listed above, I tend to favor Approach 3. My editor of choice is Vim, which provides a
       rich set of features for handling multiple tag files, which partly  influences  my  choice.  If  you  are
       working  with  source files on a remote file system, then I would recommend either Approach 3 or Approach
       4, depending upon the hit when reading the global tag file.

       The advantages of Approach 3 are many (assuming that your editor has the ability to support both multiple
       tag files and duplicate tags). All lookups of tag located in the current directory are fast and the local
       tag file can be quickly and easily regenerated in one second or less (I have even mapped a  keystroke  to
       do  this easily). A lookup of a (necessarily non-static) tag found in another directory fails a lookup in
       the local tag file, but is found in the global tag file, which satisfies all cross-directory lookups. The
       global tag file can be automatically regenerated periodically with a cron job (and perhaps the local  tag
       files also).

       Now  I  give an example of how you would implement Approach 3. Means of implementing the other approaches
       can be performed in a similar manner.

       Here is a visual representation of an example directory hierarchy:

          project
          `-----misccomp
          |       `...
          `-----sysint
                  `-----client
                  |       `-----hdrs
                  |       `-----lib
                  |       `-----src
                  |       `-----test
                  `-----common
                  |       `-----hdrs
                  |       `-----lib
                  |       `-----src
                  |       `-----test
                  `-----server
                          `-----hdrs
                          `-----lib
                          `-----src
                          `-----test

       Here is a recommended solution (conceptually) to build the tag files:

       1. Within each of the leaf nodes (i.e. <b>hdrs</b>, <b>lib</b>, <b>src</b>, <b>test</b>) build a tag file using "<b>ctags</b> <b>*.[ch]</b>".  This
          can  be  easily  be done for the whole hierarchy by making a shell script, call it <b>dirtags</b>, containing
          the following lines:

                 #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
                 cd $1
                 ctags *

          Now execute the following command:

                 find * -type d -exec dirtags {} \;

          These tag files are trivial (and extremely quick) to rebuild while making changes within a  directory.
          The  following Vim key mapping is quite useful to rebuild the tag file in the directory of the current
          source file:

                 :nmap ,t :!(cd %:p:h;ctags *.[ch])&amp;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;

       2. Build the global tag file:

                 cd <a href="file:~/project">~/project</a>
                 ctags --file-scope=no -R

          thus constructing a tag file containing only non-static tags for all source files  in  all  descendent
          directories.

       3. Configure  your  editor  to  read  the local tag file first, then consult the global tag file when not
          found in the local tag file. In Vim, this is done as follows:

                 :set tags=./tags,tags,<a href="file:~/project/tags">~/project/tags</a>

       If you wish to implement Approach 4, you would need to replace the <b>dirtags</b> script  of  step  1  with  the
       following:

              #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
              cd $1
              ctags *
              # Now append the non-static tags from descendent directories

              find * -type d -prune -print | ctags -aR --file-scope=no -L-
       And replace the configuration of step 3 with this:

              :set tags=./tags;$HOME,tags

       As a caveat, it should be noted that step 2 builds a global tag file whose file names will be relative to
       the  directory  in  which the global tag file is being built. This takes advantage of the Vim <b>tagrelative</b>
       option, which causes the path to be interpreted a relative to the location of the tag file instead of the
       current directory. For standard vi, which  always  interprets  the  paths  as  relative  to  the  current
       directory,  we  need  to  build the global tag file with absolute path names. This can be accomplished by
       replacing step 2 with the following:

              cd <a href="file:~/project">~/project</a>
              ctags --file-scope=no -R `pwd`

   <b>Does</b> <b>Universal</b> <b>Ctags</b> <b>support</b> <b>Unicode</b> <b>file</b> <b>names?</b>
       Yes, Unicode file names are supported on unix-like platforms (Linux, macOS, Cygwin, etc.).

       However, on Windows, you need to use Windows 10 version 1903 or later to use Unicode file names. (This is
       an experimental feature, though.) On older versions on Windows, Universal Ctags only support  file  names
       represented  in the current code page. If you still want to use Unicode file names on them, use Cygwin or
       MSYS2 version of Universal Ctags as a workaround.

   <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>zsh</b> <b>cause</b> <b>"zsh:</b> <b>no</b> <b>matches</b> <b>found"</b> <b>error?</b>
       zsh causes error on the following cases;

              ctags --extra=+* ...
              ctags --exclude=foo/* ...

       This is the 2nd most significant incompatibility <u>feature</u> of zsh.

       Cited   from   "Z-Shell   Frequently-Asked   Questions",   "2.1:   Differences   from    sh    and    ksh
       &lt;<a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/FAQ/zshfaq02.html">http://zsh.sourceforge.net/FAQ/zshfaq02.html</a>&gt; ";
          ...  The  next most classic difference is that unmatched glob patterns cause the command to abort; set
          <b>NO_NOMATCH</b> for those.

       You may add "<b>setopt</b> <b>nonomatch</b>" on your <b><a href="file:~/.zshrc">~/.zshrc</a></b>. Or you can escape glob patterns with backslash;

              ctags --extra=+\* ...
              ctags --exclude=foo/\* ...

       Or quote them;

              ctags '--extra=+*' ...
              ctags '--exclude=foo/*' ...
