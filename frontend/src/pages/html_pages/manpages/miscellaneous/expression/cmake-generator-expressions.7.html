</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cmake-generator-expressions - CMake Generator Expressions

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       Generator  expressions  are  evaluated  during build system generation to produce information specific to
       each build configuration.  They have the form <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>.  For example:

          target_include_directories(tgt PRIVATE /opt/include/$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt;)

       This would expand to <b>/opt/include/GNU</b>, <b>/opt/include/Clang</b>, etc.  depending on the C++ compiler used.

       Generator expressions are allowed in the context of  many  target  properties,  such  as  <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u>,
       <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>,  <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u>  and  others.   They  may  also  be used when using commands to
       populate   those   properties,    such    as    <u>target_link_libraries()</u>,    <u>target_include_directories()</u>,
       <u>target_compile_definitions()</u>  and  others.  They enable conditional linking, conditional definitions used
       when compiling, conditional include directories, and more.  The conditions may  be  based  on  the  build
       configuration, target properties, platform information, or any other queryable information.

       Generator expressions can be nested:

          target_compile_definitions(tgt PRIVATE
            $&lt;$&lt;VERSION_LESS:$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt;,4.2.0&gt;:OLD_COMPILER&gt;
          )

       The above would expand to <b>OLD_COMPILER</b> if the <u>CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_VERSION</u> is less than 4.2.0.

</pre><h4><b>WHITESPACE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>QUOTING</b></h4><pre>
       Generator  expressions  are typically parsed after command arguments.  If a generator expression contains
       spaces, new lines, semicolons or other characters that may be interpreted as command argument separators,
       the whole expression should be surrounded by quotes when passed to a  command.   Failure  to  do  so  may
       result in the expression being split and it may no longer be recognized as a generator expression.

       When using <u>add_custom_command()</u> or <u>add_custom_target()</u>, use the <b>VERBATIM</b> and <b>COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS</b> options
       to obtain robust argument splitting and quoting.

          # WRONG: Embedded space will be treated as an argument separator.
          # This ends up not being seen as a generator expression at all.
          add_custom_target(run_some_tool
            COMMAND some_tool -I$&lt;JOIN:$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES&gt;, -I&gt;
            VERBATIM
          )

          # Better, but still not robust. Quotes prevent the space from splitting the
          # expression. However, the tool will receive the expanded value as a single
          # argument.
          add_custom_target(run_some_tool
            COMMAND some_tool "-I$&lt;JOIN:$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES&gt;, -I&gt;"
            VERBATIM
          )

          # Nearly correct. Using a semicolon to separate arguments and adding the
          # COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS option means that paths with spaces will be handled
          # correctly. Quoting the whole expression ensures it is seen as a generator
          # expression. But if the target property is empty, we will get a bare -I
          # with nothing after it.
          add_custom_target(run_some_tool
            COMMAND some_tool "-I$&lt;JOIN:$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES&gt;,;-I&gt;"
            COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS
            VERBATIM
          )

       Using  variables  to build up a more complex generator expression is also a good way to reduce errors and
       improve readability.  The above example can be improved further like so:

          # The $&lt;BOOL:...&gt; check prevents adding anything if the property is empty,
          # assuming the property value cannot be one of CMake's false constants.
          set(prop "$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES&gt;")
          add_custom_target(run_some_tool
            COMMAND some_tool "$&lt;$&lt;BOOL:${prop}&gt;:-I$&lt;JOIN:${prop},;-I&gt;&gt;"
            COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS
            VERBATIM
          )

       Finally, the above example can be expressed in a more simple and robust way using an alternate  generator
       expression:

          add_custom_target(run_some_tool
            COMMAND some_tool "$&lt;LIST:TRANSFORM,$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES&gt;,PREPEND,-I&gt;"
            COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS
            VERBATIM
          )

       A common mistake is to try to split a generator expression across multiple lines with indenting:

          # WRONG: New lines and spaces all treated as argument separators, so the
          # generator expression is split and not recognized correctly.
          target_compile_definitions(tgt PRIVATE
            $&lt;$&lt;AND:
                $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:GNU&gt;,
                $&lt;VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL:$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt;,5&gt;
              &gt;:HAVE_5_OR_LATER&gt;
          )

       Again, use helper variables with well-chosen names to build up a readable expression instead:

          set(is_gnu "$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:GNU&gt;")
          set(v5_or_later "$&lt;VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL:$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt;,5&gt;")
          set(meet_requirements "$&lt;AND:${is_gnu},${v5_or_later}&gt;")
          target_compile_definitions(tgt PRIVATE
            "$&lt;${meet_requirements}:HAVE_5_OR_LATER&gt;"
          )

</pre><h4><b>DEBUGGING</b></h4><pre>
       Since generator expressions are evaluated during generation of the buildsystem, and not during processing
       of  <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>  files,  it  is  not possible to inspect their result with the <u>message()</u> command.  One
       possible way to generate debug messages is to add a custom target:

          add_custom_target(genexdebug COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "$&lt;...&gt;")

       After running <b>cmake</b>, you can then build  the  <b>genexdebug</b>  target  to  print  the  result  of  the  <b>$&lt;...&gt;</b>
       expression (i.e. run the command <u>cmake</u> <u>--build</u> <u>...</u> <u>--target</u> <u>genexdebug</u>).

       Another way is to write debug messages to a file with <u>file(GENERATE)</u>:

          file(GENERATE OUTPUT filename CONTENT "$&lt;...&gt;")

</pre><h4><b>GENERATOR</b> <b>EXPRESSION</b> <b>REFERENCE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This  reference  deviates from most of the CMake documentation in that it omits angular brackets <b>&lt;...&gt;</b>
          around placeholders like <b>condition</b>, <b>string</b>, <b>target</b>, etc.  This is to prevent an opportunity for  those
          placeholders to be misinterpreted as generator expressions.

   <b>Conditional</b> <b>Expressions</b>
       A  fundamental  category of generator expressions relates to conditional logic.  Two forms of conditional
       generator expressions are supported:

       <b>$&lt;condition:true_string&gt;</b>
              Evaluates to <b>true_string</b> if <b>condition</b> is <b>1</b>, or an empty string if <b>condition</b> evaluates to  <b>0</b>.   Any
              other value for <b>condition</b> results in an error.

       <b>$&lt;IF:condition,true_string,false_string&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.8.

              Evaluates  to  <b>true_string</b>  if <b>condition</b> is <b>1</b>, or <b>false_string</b> if <b>condition</b> is <b>0</b>.  Any other value
              for <b>condition</b> results in an error.

              Added in version 3.28: This generator expression short-circuits such that generator expressions in
              <b>false_string</b> will not evaluate when <b>condition</b> is <b>1</b>, and generator expressions in <b>true_string</b>  will
              not evaluate when condition is <b>0</b>.

       Typically,  the  <b>condition</b>  is  itself  a  generator  expression.  For instance, the following expression
       expands to <b>DEBUG_MODE</b> when the  <b>Debug</b>  configuration  is  used,  and  the  empty  string  for  all  other
       configurations:

          $&lt;$&lt;CONFIG:Debug&gt;:DEBUG_MODE&gt;

       Boolean-like  <b>condition</b>  values  other  than  <b>1</b> or <b>0</b> can be handled by wrapping them with the <b>$&lt;BOOL:...&gt;</b>
       generator expression:

       <b>$&lt;BOOL:string&gt;</b>
              Converts <b>string</b> to <b>0</b> or <b>1</b>. Evaluates to <b>0</b> if any of the following is true:

              • <b>string</b> is empty,

              • <b>string</b> is a case-insensitive equal of <b>0</b>, <b>FALSE</b>, <b>OFF</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>NO</b>, <b>IGNORE</b>, or <b>NOTFOUND</b>, or

              • <b>string</b> ends in the suffix <b>-NOTFOUND</b> (case-sensitive).

              Otherwise evaluates to <b>1</b>.

       The <b>$&lt;BOOL:...&gt;</b> generator expression is often used when a <b>condition</b> is provided by a CMake variable:

          $&lt;$&lt;BOOL:${HAVE_SOME_FEATURE}&gt;:-DENABLE_SOME_FEATURE&gt;

   <b>Logical</b> <b>Operators</b>
       The common boolean logic operators are supported:

       <b>$&lt;AND:conditions&gt;</b>
              where <b>conditions</b> is a comma-separated list of boolean expressions, all of which must  evaluate  to
              either  <b>1</b> or <b>0</b>.  The whole expression evaluates to <b>1</b> if all conditions are <b>1</b>.  If any condition is
              <b>0</b>, the whole expression evaluates to <b>0</b>.

       <b>$&lt;OR:conditions&gt;</b>
              where <b>conditions</b> is a comma-separated list of boolean expressions.  all of which must evaluate  to
              either  <b>1</b>  or  <b>0</b>.  The whole expression evaluates to <b>1</b> if at least one of the <b>conditions</b> is <b>1</b>.  If
              all <b>conditions</b> evaluate to <b>0</b>, the whole expression evaluates to <b>0</b>.

       <b>$&lt;NOT:condition&gt;</b>
              <b>condition</b> must be <b>0</b> or <b>1</b>.  The result of the expression is <b>0</b> if <b>condition</b> is <b>1</b>, else <b>1</b>.

       Added in version 3.28: Logical operators short-circuit such that generator expressions in  the  arguments
       list will not be evaluated once a return value can be determined.

   <b>Primary</b> <b>Comparison</b> <b>Expressions</b>
       CMake  supports  a variety of generator expressions that compare things.  This section covers the primary
       and most widely used comparison types.  Other more specific comparison types are documented in their  own
       separate sections further below.

   <b>String</b> <b>Comparisons</b>
       <b>$&lt;STREQUAL:string1,string2&gt;</b>
              <b>1</b>  if  <b>string1</b>  and  <b>string2</b>  are  equal,  else  <b>0</b>.   The  comparison  is  case-sensitive.   For a
              case-insensitive comparison,  combine  with  a  <u>string</u>  <u>transforming</u>  <u>generator</u>  <u>expression</u>.   For
              example, the following evaluates to <b>1</b> if <b>${foo}</b> is any of <b>BAR</b>, <b>Bar</b>, <b>bar</b>, etc.

                 $&lt;STREQUAL:$&lt;UPPER_CASE:${foo}&gt;,BAR&gt;

       <b>$&lt;EQUAL:value1,value2&gt;</b>
              <b>1</b> if <b>value1</b> and <b>value2</b> are numerically equal, else <b>0</b>.

   <b>Version</b> <b>Comparisons</b>
       <b>$&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt;</b>
              <b>1</b> if <b>v1</b> is a version less than <b>v2</b>, else <b>0</b>.

       <b>$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt;</b>
              <b>1</b> if <b>v1</b> is a version greater than <b>v2</b>, else <b>0</b>.

       <b>$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt;</b>
              <b>1</b> if <b>v1</b> is the same version as <b>v2</b>, else <b>0</b>.

       <b>$&lt;VERSION_LESS_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              <b>1</b> if <b>v1</b> is a version less than or equal to <b>v2</b>, else <b>0</b>.

       <b>$&lt;VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              <b>1</b> if <b>v1</b> is a version greater than or equal to <b>v2</b>, else <b>0</b>.

   <b>String</b> <b>Transformations</b>
       <b>$&lt;LOWER_CASE:string&gt;</b>
              Content of <b>string</b> converted to lower case.

       <b>$&lt;UPPER_CASE:string&gt;</b>
              Content of <b>string</b> converted to upper case.

       <b>$&lt;MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER:...&gt;</b>
              Content  of  <b>...</b>  converted  to  a  C  identifier.   The  conversion  follows the same behavior as
              <u>string(MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER)</u>.

   <b>List</b> <b>Expressions</b>
       Most of the expressions in this section are closely associated with the  <u>list()</u>  command,  providing  the
       same capabilities, but in the form of a generator expression.

       In each of the following list-related generator expressions, the <b>list</b> must not contain any commas if that
       generator  expression  expects  something  to  be  provided  after the <b>list</b>.  For example, the expression
       <b>$&lt;LIST:FIND,list,value&gt;</b> requires a <b>value</b> after the <b>list</b>.  Since a comma is used to separate the <b>list</b>  and
       the  <b>value</b>,  the  <b>list</b>  cannot  itself  contain  a  comma.  This restriction does not apply to the <u>list()</u>
       command, it is specific to the list-handling generator expressions only.

   <b>List</b> <b>Comparisons</b>
       <b>$&lt;IN_LIST:string,list&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              <b>1</b> if <b>string</b> is  an  item  in  the  semicolon-separated  <b>list</b>,  else  <b>0</b>.   It  uses  case-sensitive
              comparisons.

   <b>List</b> <b>Queries</b>
       <b>$&lt;LIST:LENGTH,list&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              The number of items in the <b>list</b>.

       <b>$&lt;LIST:GET,list,index,...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              Expands to the list of items specified by indices from the <b>list</b>.

       <b>$&lt;LIST:SUBLIST,list,begin,length&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              A  sublist of the given <b>list</b>.  If <b>length</b> is 0, an empty list will be returned.  If <b>length</b> is -1 or
              the list is smaller than <b>begin</b> <b>+</b> <b>length</b>, the remaining items of the list starting at <b>begin</b> will be
              returned.

       <b>$&lt;LIST:FIND,list,value&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              The index of the first item in <b>list</b> with the specified <b>value</b>, or -1 if <b>value</b> is not in the <b>list</b>.

   <b>List</b> <b>Transformations</b>
       <b>$&lt;LIST:JOIN,list,glue&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              Converts <b>list</b> to a single string with the content of the <b>glue</b> string inserted between  each  item.
              This  is conceptually the same operation as <u>$&lt;JOIN:list,glue&gt;</u>, but the two have different behavior
              with  regard  to  empty  items.   <b>$&lt;LIST:JOIN,list,glue&gt;</b>  preserves  all  empty   items,   whereas
              <u>$&lt;JOIN:list,glue&gt;</u> drops all empty items from the list.

       <b>$&lt;LIST:APPEND,list,item,...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              The <b>list</b> with each <b>item</b> appended.  Multiple items should be separated by commas.

       <b>$&lt;LIST:PREPEND,list,item,...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              The  <b>list</b>  with  each <b>item</b> inserted at the beginning.  If there are multiple items, they should be
              separated by commas, and the order of the prepended items will be preserved.

       <b>$&lt;LIST:INSERT,list,index,item,...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              The <b>list</b> with the <b>item</b> (or multiple items) inserted at the specified <b>index</b>.  Multiple items should
              be separated by commas.

              It is an error to specify an out-of-range <b>index</b>. Valid indexes are 0 to N, where N is  the  length
              of the list, inclusive. An empty list has length 0.

       <b>$&lt;LIST:POP_BACK,list&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              The <b>list</b> with the last item removed.

       <b>$&lt;LIST:POP_FRONT,list&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              The <b>list</b> with the first item removed.

       <b>$&lt;LIST:REMOVE_ITEM,list,value,...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              The <b>list</b> with all instances of the given <b>value</b> (or values) removed.  If multiple values are given,
              they should be separated by commas.

       <b>$&lt;LIST:REMOVE_AT,list,index,...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              The <b>list</b> with the item at each given <b>index</b> removed.

       <b>$&lt;LIST:REMOVE_DUPLICATES,list&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              The  <b>list</b>  with  all  duplicated  items removed.  The relative order of items is preserved, but if
              duplicates are encountered, only the first instance is preserved.   The  result  is  the  same  as
              <u>$&lt;REMOVE_DUPLICATES:list&gt;</u>.

       <b>$&lt;LIST:FILTER,list,INCLUDE|EXCLUDE,regex&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              A  list  of  items  from  the  <b>list</b>  which  match  (<b>INCLUDE</b>) or do not match (<b>EXCLUDE</b>) the regular
              expression <b>regex</b>.  The result is the same as <u>$&lt;FILTER:list,INCLUDE|EXCLUDE,regex&gt;</u>.

       <b>$&lt;LIST:TRANSFORM,list,ACTION[,SELECTOR]&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              The <b>list</b> transformed by applying an <b>ACTION</b> to all or, by specifying a <b>SELECTOR</b>,  to  the  selected
              list items.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 The  <b>TRANSFORM</b>  sub-command  does  not change the number of items in the list. If a <b>SELECTOR</b> is
                 specified, only some items will be changed, the other ones will remain the same as  before  the
                 transformation.

              <b>ACTION</b>  specifies the action to apply to the items of the list.  The actions have exactly the same
              semantics as for the <u>list(TRANSFORM)</u> command.  <b>ACTION</b> must be one of the following:

                 <u>APPEND</u><b>,</b> <u>PREPEND</u>
                        Append, prepend specified value to each item of the list.

                            $&lt;LIST:TRANSFORM,list,(APPEND|PREPEND),value[,SELECTOR]&gt;

                 <u>TOLOWER</u><b>,</b> <u>TOUPPER</u>
                        Convert each item of the list to lower, upper characters.

                            $&lt;LIST:TRANSFORM,list,(TOLOWER|TOUPPER)[,SELECTOR]&gt;

                 <u>STRIP</u>  Remove leading and trailing spaces from each item of the list.

                            $&lt;LIST:TRANSFORM,list,STRIP[,SELECTOR]&gt;

                 <u>REPLACE</u><b>:</b>
                        Match the regular expression as many times as possible and  substitute  the  replacement
                        expression for the match for each item of the list.

                            $&lt;LIST:TRANSFORM,list,REPLACE,regular_expression,replace_expression[,SELECTOR]&gt;

              <b>SELECTOR</b> determines which items of the list will be transformed.  Only one type of selector can be
              specified at a time. When given, <b>SELECTOR</b> must be one of the following:

                 <b>AT</b>     Specify a list of indexes.

                            $&lt;LIST:TRANSFORM,list,ACTION,AT,index[,index...]&gt;

                 <b>FOR</b>    Specify a range with, optionally, an increment used to iterate over the range.

                            $&lt;LIST:TRANSFORM,list,ACTION,FOR,start,stop[,step]&gt;

                 <b>REGEX</b>  Specify  a  regular  expression.   Only  items  matching  the regular expression will be
                        transformed.

                            $&lt;LIST:TRANSFORM,list,ACTION,REGEX,regular_expression&gt;

       <b>$&lt;JOIN:list,glue&gt;</b>
              Joins the <b>list</b> with the  content  of  the  <b>glue</b>  string  inserted  between  each  item.   This  is
              conceptually  the  same  operation  as <u>$&lt;LIST:JOIN,list,glue&gt;</u>, but the two have different behavior
              with  regard  to  empty  items.   <u>$&lt;LIST:JOIN,list,glue&gt;</u>  preserves  all  empty   items,   whereas
              <b>$&lt;JOIN,list,glue&gt;</b> drops all empty items from the list.

       <b>$&lt;REMOVE_DUPLICATES:list&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              Removes  duplicated  items  in  the  given  <b>list</b>. The relative order of items is preserved, and if
              duplicates are encountered, only the first instance is  retained.   The  result  is  the  same  as
              <u>$&lt;LIST:REMOVE_DUPLICATES,list&gt;</u>.

       <b>$&lt;FILTER:list,INCLUDE|EXCLUDE,regex&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              Includes  or  removes  items from <b>list</b> that match the regular expression <b>regex</b>.  The result is the
              same as <u>$&lt;LIST:FILTER,list,INCLUDE|EXCLUDE,regex&gt;</u>.

   <b>List</b> <b>Ordering</b>
       <b>$&lt;LIST:REVERSE,list&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              The <b>list</b> with the items in reverse order.

       <b>$&lt;LIST:SORT,list[,(COMPARE:option|CASE:option|ORDER:option)]...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              The <b>list</b> sorted according to the specified options.

              Use one of the <b>COMPARE</b> options to select the comparison method for sorting:

                 <b>STRING</b> Sorts a list of strings alphabetically.  This is the default  behavior  if  the  <b>COMPARE</b>
                        option is not given.

                 <b>FILE_BASENAME</b>
                        Sorts a list of file paths by their basenames.

                 <b>NATURAL</b>
                        Sorts  a  list of strings using natural order (see the man page for <b><a href="../man3/strverscmp.3.html">strverscmp</a>(3)</b>), such
                        that contiguous digits are compared as whole numbers.  For example, the  following  list
                        <b>10.0</b>  <b>1.1</b>  <b>2.1</b>  <b>8.0</b>  <b>2.0</b>  <b>3.1</b>  will be sorted as <b>1.1</b> <b>2.0</b> <b>2.1</b> <b>3.1</b> <b>8.0</b> <b>10.0</b> if the <b>NATURAL</b>
                        comparison is selected, whereas it will be sorted as <b>1.1</b> <b>10.0</b> <b>2.0</b> <b>2.1</b> <b>3.1</b> <b>8.0</b>  with  the
                        <b>STRING</b> comparison.

              Use one of the <b>CASE</b> options to select a case-sensitive or case-insensitive sort mode:

                 <b>SENSITIVE</b>
                        List  items  are sorted in a case-sensitive manner.  This is the default behavior if the
                        <b>CASE</b> option is not given.

                 <b>INSENSITIVE</b>
                        List items are sorted in a case-insensitive manner.  The order  of  items  which  differ
                        only by upper/lowercase is not specified.

              To control the sort order, one of the <b>ORDER</b> options can be given:

                 <b>ASCENDING</b>
                        Sorts  the  list in ascending order.  This is the default behavior when the <b>ORDER</b> option
                        is not given.

                 <b>DESCENDING</b>
                        Sorts the list in descending order.

              Options can be specified in any order, but it is an error to  specify  the  same  option  multiple
              times.

                 $&lt;LIST:SORT,list,CASE:SENSITIVE,COMPARE:STRING,ORDER:DESCENDING&gt;

   <b>Path</b> <b>Expressions</b>
       Most  of  the expressions in this section are closely associated with the <u>cmake_path()</u> command, providing
       the same capabilities, but in the form of a generator expression.

       For all generator expressions in this section, paths are  expected  to  be  in  cmake-style  format.  The
       <u>$&lt;PATH:CMAKE_PATH&gt;</u> generator expression can be used to convert a native path to a cmake-style one.

   <b>Path</b> <b>Comparisons</b>
       <b>$&lt;PATH_EQUAL:path1,path2&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Compares  the  lexical representations of two paths. No normalization is performed on either path.
              Returns <b>1</b> if the paths are equal, <b>0</b> otherwise.

              See <u>cmake_path(COMPARE)</u> for more details.

   <b>Path</b> <b>Queries</b>
       These expressions provide the generation-time  capabilities  equivalent  to  the  <u>Query</u>  options  of  the
       <u>cmake_path()</u> command.  All paths are expected to be in cmake-style format.

       <b>$&lt;PATH:HAS_*,path&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              The  following  operations  return <b>1</b> if the particular path component is present, <b>0</b> otherwise. See
              <u>Path</u> <u>Structure</u> <u>And</u> <u>Terminology</u> for the meaning of each path component.

                 $&lt;PATH:HAS_ROOT_NAME,path&gt;
                 $&lt;PATH:HAS_ROOT_DIRECTORY,path&gt;
                 $&lt;PATH:HAS_ROOT_PATH,path&gt;
                 $&lt;PATH:HAS_FILENAME,path&gt;
                 $&lt;PATH:HAS_EXTENSION,path&gt;
                 $&lt;PATH:HAS_STEM,path&gt;
                 $&lt;PATH:HAS_RELATIVE_PART,path&gt;
                 $&lt;PATH:HAS_PARENT_PATH,path&gt;

              Note the following special cases:

              • For <b>HAS_ROOT_PATH</b>, a true result will  only  be  returned  if  at  least  one  of  <b>root-name</b>  or
                <b>root-directory</b> is non-empty.

              • For  <b>HAS_PARENT_PATH</b>,  the  root  directory  is  also considered to have a parent, which will be
                itself.  The result is true except if the path consists of just a <u>filename</u>.

       <b>$&lt;PATH:IS_ABSOLUTE,path&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Returns <b>1</b> if the path is <u>absolute</u>, <b>0</b> otherwise.

       <b>$&lt;PATH:IS_RELATIVE,path&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              This will return the opposite of <b>IS_ABSOLUTE</b>.

       <b>$&lt;PATH:IS_PREFIX[,NORMALIZE],path,input&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Returns <b>1</b> if <b>path</b> is the prefix of <b>input</b>, <b>0</b> otherwise.

              When the <b>NORMALIZE</b> option is specified, <b>path</b> and <b>input</b> are <u>normalized</u> before the check.

   <b>Path</b> <b>Decomposition</b>
       These expressions provide the generation-time capabilities equivalent to the <u>Decomposition</u> options of the
       <u>cmake_path()</u> command.  All paths are expected to be in cmake-style format.

       <b>$&lt;PATH:GET_*,...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              The following operations retrieve a different component or group of components from  a  path.  See
              <u>Path</u> <u>Structure</u> <u>And</u> <u>Terminology</u> for the meaning of each path component.

              Changed  in  version  3.27:  All operations now accept a list of paths as argument. When a list of
              paths is specified, the operation will be applied to each path.

                 $&lt;PATH:GET_ROOT_NAME,path...&gt;
                 $&lt;PATH:GET_ROOT_DIRECTORY,path...&gt;
                 $&lt;PATH:GET_ROOT_PATH,path...&gt;
                 $&lt;PATH:GET_FILENAME,path...&gt;
                 $&lt;PATH:GET_EXTENSION[,LAST_ONLY],path...&gt;
                 $&lt;PATH:GET_STEM[,LAST_ONLY],path...&gt;
                 $&lt;PATH:GET_RELATIVE_PART,path...&gt;
                 $&lt;PATH:GET_PARENT_PATH,path...&gt;

              If a requested component is not present in the path, an empty string is returned.

   <b>Path</b> <b>Transformations</b>
       These expressions provide the generation-time capabilities equivalent to the <u>Modification</u> and  <u>Generation</u>
       options of the <u>cmake_path()</u> command.  All paths are expected to be in cmake-style format.

       Changed  in  version 3.27: All operations now accept a list of paths as argument. When a list of paths is
       specified, the operation will be applied to each path.

       <b>$&lt;PATH:CMAKE_PATH[,NORMALIZE],path...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Returns <b>path</b>.  If  <b>path</b>  is  a  native  path,  it  is  converted  into  a  cmake-style  path  with
              forward-slashes (<b>/</b>). On Windows, the long filename marker is taken into account.

              When the <b>NORMALIZE</b> option is specified, the path is <u>normalized</u> after the conversion.

       <b>$&lt;PATH:APPEND,path...,input,...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Returns  all the <b>input</b> arguments appended to <b>path</b> using <b>/</b> as the <b>directory-separator</b>. Depending on
              the <b>input</b>, the value of <b>path</b> may be discarded.

              See <u>cmake_path(APPEND)</u> for more details.

       <b>$&lt;PATH:REMOVE_FILENAME,path...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Returns <b>path</b> with filename component (as returned by <b>$&lt;PATH:GET_FILENAME&gt;</b>) removed. After removal,
              any trailing <b>directory-separator</b> is left alone, if present.

              See <u>cmake_path(REMOVE_FILENAME)</u> for more details.

       <b>$&lt;PATH:REPLACE_FILENAME,path...,input&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Returns <b>path</b> with the filename component replaced by <b>input</b>. If  <b>path</b>  has  no  filename  component
              (i.e. <b>$&lt;PATH:HAS_FILENAME&gt;</b> returns <b>0</b>), <b>path</b> is unchanged.

              See <u>cmake_path(REPLACE_FILENAME)</u> for more details.

       <b>$&lt;PATH:REMOVE_EXTENSION[,LAST_ONLY],path...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Returns <b>path</b> with the <u>extension</u> removed, if any.

              See <u>cmake_path(REMOVE_EXTENSION)</u> for more details.

       <b>$&lt;PATH:REPLACE_EXTENSION[,LAST_ONLY],path...,input&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Returns <b>path</b> with the <u>extension</u> replaced by <b>input</b>, if any.

              See <u>cmake_path(REPLACE_EXTENSION)</u> for more details.

       <b>$&lt;PATH:NORMAL_PATH,path...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Returns <b>path</b> normalized according to the steps described in <u>Normalization</u>.

       <b>$&lt;PATH:RELATIVE_PATH,path...,base_directory&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Returns <b>path</b>, modified to make it relative to the <b>base_directory</b> argument.

              See <u>cmake_path(RELATIVE_PATH)</u> for more details.

       <b>$&lt;PATH:ABSOLUTE_PATH[,NORMALIZE],path...,base_directory&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Returns  <b>path</b>  as  absolute.  If  <b>path</b>  is  a relative path (<b>$&lt;PATH:IS_RELATIVE&gt;</b> returns <b>1</b>), it is
              evaluated relative to the given base directory specified by <b>base_directory</b> argument.

              When the <b>NORMALIZE</b> option is specified, the path is <u>normalized</u> after the path computation.

              See <u>cmake_path(ABSOLUTE_PATH)</u> for more details.

   <b>Shell</b> <b>Paths</b>
       <b>$&lt;SHELL_PATH:...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.4.

              Content of <b>...</b> converted to shell path style. For example, slashes are converted to backslashes in
              Windows shells and drive letters are converted to posix paths in MSYS shells. The <b>...</b> must  be  an
              absolute path.

              Added in version 3.14: The <b>...</b> may be a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of paths, in which case each path
              is  converted  individually  and  a  result list is generated using the shell path separator (<b>:</b> on
              POSIX and <b>;</b> on Windows).  Be sure to enclose the argument containing this genex in  double  quotes
              in CMake source code so that <b>;</b> does not split arguments.

   <b>Configuration</b> <b>Expressions</b>
       <b>$&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
              Configuration name. Use this instead of the deprecated <u>CONFIGURATION</u> generator expression.

       <b>$&lt;CONFIG:cfgs&gt;</b>
              <b>1</b>  if  config  is  any  one  of  the  entries  in  comma-separated  list  <b>cfgs</b>,  else <b>0</b>. This is a
              case-insensitive comparison. The mapping in <u>MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>  is  also  considered  by
              this expression when it is evaluated on a property of an <u>IMPORTED</u> target.

              Changed  in  version  3.19:  Multiple  configurations  can  be specified for <b>cfgs</b>.  CMake 3.18 and
              earlier only accepted a single configuration.

       <b>$&lt;OUTPUT_CONFIG:...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.20.

              Only valid in <u>add_custom_command()</u> and <u>add_custom_target()</u> as the outer-most generator  expression
              in an argument.  With the <u>Ninja</u> <u>Multi-Config</u> generator, generator expressions in <b>...</b> are evaluated
              using  the  custom  command's  "output  config".   With  other  generators,  the content of <b>...</b> is
              evaluated normally.

       <b>$&lt;COMMAND_CONFIG:...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.20.

              Only valid in <u>add_custom_command()</u> and <u>add_custom_target()</u> as the outer-most generator  expression
              in an argument.  With the <u>Ninja</u> <u>Multi-Config</u> generator, generator expressions in <b>...</b> are evaluated
              using  the  custom  command's  "command  config".   With  other  generators, the content of <b>...</b> is
              evaluated normally.

              The compile language of source files when evaluating compile options.   See  <u>the</u>  <u>related</u>  <u>boolean</u>
              <u>expression</u>  <b>$&lt;COMPILE_LANGUAGE:language&gt;</b>  for  notes  about  the  portability  of  this  generator
              expression.

       <b>$&lt;COMPILE_LANGUAGE:languages&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.3.

              Changed in version 3.15: Multiple languages can  be  specified  for  <b>languages</b>.   CMake  3.14  and
              earlier only accepted a single language.

              <b>1</b>  when  the  language  used  for  compilation  unit matches any of the comma-separated entries in
              <b>languages</b>, otherwise  <b>0</b>.  This  expression  may  be  used  to  specify  compile  options,  compile
              definitions,  and  include  directories for source files of a particular language in a target. For
              example:

                 add_executable(myapp main.cpp foo.c bar.cpp zot.cu)
                 target_compile_options(myapp
                   PRIVATE $&lt;$&lt;COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX&gt;:-fno-exceptions&gt;
                 )
                 target_compile_definitions(myapp
                   PRIVATE $&lt;$&lt;COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX&gt;:COMPILING_CXX&gt;
                           $&lt;$&lt;COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CUDA&gt;:COMPILING_CUDA&gt;
                 )
                 target_include_directories(myapp
                   PRIVATE $&lt;$&lt;COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX,CUDA&gt;:/opt/foo/headers&gt;
                 )

              This specifies the use of the <b>-fno-exceptions</b> compile option,  <b>COMPILING_CXX</b>  compile  definition,
              and  <b>cxx_headers</b>  include directory for C++ only (compiler id checks elided).  It also specifies a
              <b>COMPILING_CUDA</b> compile definition for CUDA.

              Note that with <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u> and <u>Xcode</u> there is no way to represent target-wide compile
              definitions or include directories separately for <b>C</b> and <b>CXX</b> languages.  Also, with  <u>Visual</u>  <u>Studio</u>
              <u>Generators</u>  there  is  no  way  to represent target-wide flags separately for <b>C</b> and <b>CXX</b> languages.
              Under these generators, expressions for both C and C++ sources will  be  evaluated  using  <b>CXX</b>  if
              there are any C++ sources and otherwise using <b>C</b>.  A workaround is to create separate libraries for
              each source file language instead:

                 add_library(myapp_c foo.c)
                 add_library(myapp_cxx bar.cpp)
                 target_compile_options(myapp_cxx PUBLIC -fno-exceptions)
                 add_executable(myapp main.cpp)
                 target_link_libraries(myapp myapp_c myapp_cxx)

       <b>$&lt;COMPILE_LANG_AND_ID:language,compiler_ids&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              <b>1</b>  when  the  language  used  for compilation unit matches <b>language</b> and CMake's compiler id of the
              <b>language</b> compiler matches any one of the comma-separated entries  in  <b>compiler_ids</b>,  otherwise  <b>0</b>.
              This  expression  is  a  short  form  for  the  combination  of  <b>$&lt;COMPILE_LANGUAGE:language&gt;</b>  and
              <b>$&lt;LANG_COMPILER_ID:compiler_ids&gt;</b>. This expression may be used to specify compile options,  compile
              definitions,  and  include  directories  for  source  files  of a particular language and compiler
              combination in a target.  For example:

                 add_executable(myapp main.cpp foo.c bar.cpp zot.cu)
                 target_compile_definitions(myapp
                   PRIVATE $&lt;$&lt;COMPILE_LANG_AND_ID:CXX,AppleClang,Clang&gt;:COMPILING_CXX_WITH_CLANG&gt;
                           $&lt;$&lt;COMPILE_LANG_AND_ID:CXX,Intel&gt;:COMPILING_CXX_WITH_INTEL&gt;
                           $&lt;$&lt;COMPILE_LANG_AND_ID:C,Clang&gt;:COMPILING_C_WITH_CLANG&gt;
                 )

              This specifies the use of different  compile  definitions  based  on  both  the  compiler  id  and
              compilation  language.  This  example will have a <b>COMPILING_CXX_WITH_CLANG</b> compile definition when
              Clang is the CXX compiler, and <b>COMPILING_CXX_WITH_INTEL</b> when Intel is the CXX compiler.  Likewise,
              when the C compiler is Clang, it will only see the <b>COMPILING_C_WITH_CLANG</b> definition.

              Without the <b>COMPILE_LANG_AND_ID</b> generator expression, the same logic would be expressed as:

                 target_compile_definitions(myapp
                   PRIVATE $&lt;$&lt;AND:$&lt;COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX&gt;,$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:AppleClang,Clang&gt;&gt;:COMPILING_CXX_WITH_CLANG&gt;
                           $&lt;$&lt;AND:$&lt;COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX&gt;,$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:Intel&gt;&gt;:COMPILING_CXX_WITH_INTEL&gt;
                           $&lt;$&lt;AND:$&lt;COMPILE_LANGUAGE:C&gt;,$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:Clang&gt;&gt;:COMPILING_C_WITH_CLANG&gt;
                 )

   <b>Compile</b> <b>Features</b>
       <b>$&lt;COMPILE_FEATURES:features&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.1.

              where <b>features</b> is a comma-separated list.  Evaluates to <b>1</b> if all of the <b>features</b> are available for
              the 'head' target, and <b>0</b>  otherwise.  If  this  expression  is  used  while  evaluating  the  link
              implementation of a target and if any dependency transitively increases the required <u>C_STANDARD</u> or
              <u>CXX_STANDARD</u>  for  the  'head'  target,  an  error is reported.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u>
              manual for information on compile features and a list of supported compilers.

   <b>Compile</b> <b>Context</b>
       <b>$&lt;COMPILE_ONLY:...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              Content of <b>...</b>, when collecting <u>transitive</u> <u>compile</u> <u>properties</u>, otherwise it is the  empty  string.
              This  is  intended  for  use  in an <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> and <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u> target properties,
              typically  populated  via  the  <u>target_link_libraries()</u>  command.   Provides   compilation   usage
              requirements without any linking requirements.

              Use  cases  include  header-only usage where all usages are known to not have linking requirements
              (e.g., all-<b>inline</b> or C++ template libraries).

              Note that for proper evaluation of this expression requires policy <u>CMP0099</u> to be set to <u>NEW</u>.

   <b>Linker</b> <b>Language</b> <b>And</b> <b>ID</b>
       <b>$&lt;LINK_LANGUAGE&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              The link language of the target when evaluating link options.  See <u>the</u> <u>related</u> <u>boolean</u>  <u>expression</u>
              <b>$&lt;LINK_LANGUAGE:languages&gt;</b> for notes about the portability of this generator expression.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This  generator  expression  is  not  supported  by  the  link  libraries  properties  to avoid
                 side-effects due to the double evaluation of these properties.

       <b>$&lt;LINK_LANGUAGE:languages&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              <b>1</b> when the language used for link step matches any of the comma-separated  entries  in  <b>languages</b>,
              otherwise  <b>0</b>.   This  expression  may  be  used  to  specify  link  libraries,  link options, link
              directories and link dependencies of a particular language in a target. For example:

                 add_library(api_C ...)
                 add_library(api_CXX ...)
                 add_library(api INTERFACE)
                 target_link_options(api   INTERFACE $&lt;$&lt;LINK_LANGUAGE:C&gt;:-opt_c&gt;
                                                     $&lt;$&lt;LINK_LANGUAGE:CXX&gt;:-opt_cxx&gt;)
                 target_link_libraries(api INTERFACE $&lt;$&lt;LINK_LANGUAGE:C&gt;:api_C&gt;
                                                     $&lt;$&lt;LINK_LANGUAGE:CXX&gt;:api_CXX&gt;)

                 add_executable(myapp1 main.c)
                 target_link_options(myapp1 PRIVATE api)

                 add_executable(myapp2 main.cpp)
                 target_link_options(myapp2 PRIVATE api)

              This specifies to use the <b>api</b> target for linking targets <b>myapp1</b> and <b>myapp2</b>.  In  practice,  <b>myapp1</b>
              will  link  with target <b>api_C</b> and option <b>-opt_c</b> because it will use <b>C</b> as link language. And <b>myapp2</b>
              will link with <b>api_CXX</b> and option <b>-opt_cxx</b> because <b>CXX</b> will be the link language.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 To determine the link language of a target, it is required to collect,  transitively,  all  the
                 targets which will be linked to it. So, for link libraries properties, a double evaluation will
                 be  done.  During  the  first evaluation, <b>$&lt;LINK_LANGUAGE:..&gt;</b> expressions will always return <b>0</b>.
                 The link language computed after this first pass will be used to do the second pass.  To  avoid
                 inconsistency,  it  is required that the second pass do not change the link language. Moreover,
                 to avoid unexpected side-effects, it is required to specify complete entities as  part  of  the
                 <b>$&lt;LINK_LANGUAGE:..&gt;</b> expression. For example:

                     add_library(lib STATIC file.cxx)
                     add_library(libother STATIC file.c)

                     # bad usage
                     add_executable(myapp1 main.c)
                     target_link_libraries(myapp1 PRIVATE lib$&lt;$&lt;LINK_LANGUAGE:C&gt;:other&gt;)

                     # correct usage
                     add_executable(myapp2 main.c)
                     target_link_libraries(myapp2 PRIVATE $&lt;$&lt;LINK_LANGUAGE:C&gt;:libother&gt;)

                 In  this  example,  for  <b>myapp1</b>,  the  first  pass  will, unexpectedly, determine that the link
                 language is <b>CXX</b> because the evaluation of the generator expression will be an empty  string  so
                 <b>myapp1</b>  will  depends  on  target  <b>lib</b>  which  is  <b>C++</b>.  On the contrary, for <b>myapp2</b>, the first
                 evaluation will give <b>C</b> as link language, so the second pass will correctly add target  <b>libother</b>
                 as link dependency.

       <b>$&lt;LINK_LANG_AND_ID:language,compiler_ids&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              <b>1</b>  when  the  language  used  for  link  step  matches <b>language</b> and the CMake's compiler id of the
              language linker matches any one of the comma-separated entries in <b>compiler_ids</b>, otherwise <b>0</b>.  This
              expression   is   a   short   form   for   the   combination   of   <b>$&lt;LINK_LANGUAGE:language&gt;</b>  and
              <b>$&lt;LANG_COMPILER_ID:compiler_ids&gt;</b>. This expression may be used  to  specify  link  libraries,  link
              options, link directories and link dependencies of a particular language and linker combination in
              a target. For example:

                 add_library(libC_Clang ...)
                 add_library(libCXX_Clang ...)
                 add_library(libC_Intel ...)
                 add_library(libCXX_Intel ...)

                 add_executable(myapp main.c)
                 if (CXX_CONFIG)
                   target_sources(myapp PRIVATE file.cxx)
                 endif()
                 target_link_libraries(myapp
                   PRIVATE $&lt;$&lt;LINK_LANG_AND_ID:CXX,Clang,AppleClang&gt;:libCXX_Clang&gt;
                           $&lt;$&lt;LINK_LANG_AND_ID:C,Clang,AppleClang&gt;:libC_Clang&gt;
                           $&lt;$&lt;LINK_LANG_AND_ID:CXX,Intel&gt;:libCXX_Intel&gt;
                           $&lt;$&lt;LINK_LANG_AND_ID:C,Intel&gt;:libC_Intel&gt;)

              This  specifies  the  use  of  different  link  libraries  based  on both the compiler id and link
              language. This example will have target <b>libCXX_Clang</b> as link dependency when <b>Clang</b>  or  <b>AppleClang</b>
              is  the  <b>CXX</b> linker, and <b>libCXX_Intel</b> when <b>Intel</b> is the <b>CXX</b> linker.  Likewise when the <b>C</b> linker is
              <b>Clang</b> or <b>AppleClang</b>, target <b>libC_Clang</b> will be added as link dependency and <b>libC_Intel</b> when  <b>Intel</b>
              is the <b>C</b> linker.

              See  <u>the</u>  <u>note</u>  <u>related</u>  <u>to</u>  <b>$&lt;LINK_LANGUAGE:language&gt;</b>  for  constraints  about  the usage of this
              generator expression.

   <b>Link</b> <b>Features</b>
       <b>$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:feature,library-list&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Specify a set of libraries to link to a target, along with a <b>feature</b> which provides details  about
              <u>how</u> they should be linked.  For example:

                 add_library(lib1 STATIC ...)
                 add_library(lib2 ...)
                 target_link_libraries(lib2 PRIVATE "$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:WHOLE_ARCHIVE,lib1&gt;")

              This specifies that <b>lib2</b> should link to <b>lib1</b> and use the <b>WHOLE_ARCHIVE</b> feature when doing so.

              Feature  names  are case-sensitive and may only contain letters, numbers and underscores.  Feature
              names defined in all uppercase are reserved for CMake's own built-in  features.   The  pre-defined
              built-in library features are:

              <b>DEFAULT</b>
                     This feature corresponds to standard linking, essentially equivalent to using no feature at
                     all.     It    is    typically    only    used    with    the   <u>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE</u>   and
                     <u>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE_&lt;LIBRARY&gt;</u> target properties.

              <b>WHOLE_ARCHIVE</b>
                     Force inclusion of all members of a static library.  This feature is only supported for the
                     following platforms, with limitations as noted:

                     • Linux.

                     • All BSD variants.

                     • SunOS.

                     • All Apple variants.  The library must be specified as a CMake target name, a library file
                       name (such as <b>libfoo.a</b>), or a library file path (such as <b>/path/to/libfoo.a</b>).   Due  to  a
                       limitation  of the Apple linker, it cannot be specified as a plain library name like <b>foo</b>,
                       where <b>foo</b> is not a CMake target.

                     • Windows.  When using a MSVC or MSVC-like toolchain, the MSVC version must be greater than
                       1900.

                     • Cygwin.

                     • MSYS.

              <b>FRAMEWORK</b>
                     This option tells the linker to search for the specified  framework  using  the  <b>-framework</b>
                     linker  option.   It  can  only  be  used  on  Apple platforms, and only with a linker that
                     understands the option used (i.e. the linker provided with Xcode, or  one  compatible  with
                     it).

                     The  framework  can  be  specified as a CMake framework target, a bare framework name, or a
                     file path.  If a target is given, that target must have the <u>FRAMEWORK</u> target  property  set
                     to true.  For a file path, if it contains a directory part, that directory will be added as
                     a framework search path.

                        add_library(lib SHARED ...)
                        target_link_libraries(lib PRIVATE "$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:FRAMEWORK,/path/to/my_framework&gt;")

                        # The constructed linker command line will contain:
                        #   -F/path/to -framework my_framework

                     File  paths  must  conform  to one of the following patterns (<b>*</b> is a wildcard, and optional
                     parts are shown as <b>[...]</b>):

                        • <b>[/path/to/]FwName[.framework]</b>

                        • <b>[/path/to/]FwName.framework/FwName[suffix]</b>

                        • <b>[/path/to/]FwName.framework/Versions/*/FwName[suffix]</b>

                     Note that CMake recognizes and automatically handles framework targets, even without  using
                     the  <u>$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:FRAMEWORK,...&gt;</u>  expression.  The generator expression can still be used
                     with a CMake target if the project wants to be explicit about it, but it is not required to
                     do so.  The linker command line may have  some  differences  between  using  the  generator
                     expression  or  not, but the final result should be the same.  On the other hand, if a file
                     path is given, CMake will recognize some paths  automatically,  but  not  all  cases.   The
                     project  may  want to use <u>$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:FRAMEWORK,...&gt;</u> for file paths so that the expected
                     behavior is clear.

                     Added in version 3.25: The <u>FRAMEWORK_MULTI_CONFIG_POSTFIX_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> target property as  well
                     as the <b>suffix</b> of the framework library name are now supported by the <b>FRAMEWORK</b> features.

              <b>NEEDED_FRAMEWORK</b>
                     This  is  similar  to  the  <b>FRAMEWORK</b> feature, except it forces the linker to link with the
                     framework even if no symbols are used from it.  It uses the  <b>-needed_framework</b>  option  and
                     has the same linker constraints as <b>FRAMEWORK</b>.

              <b>REEXPORT_FRAMEWORK</b>
                     This  is  similar  to  the <b>FRAMEWORK</b> feature, except it tells the linker that the framework
                     should be available to  clients  linking  to  the  library  being  created.   It  uses  the
                     <b>-reexport_framework</b> option and has the same linker constraints as <b>FRAMEWORK</b>.

              <b>WEAK_FRAMEWORK</b>
                     This is similar to the <b>FRAMEWORK</b> feature, except it forces the linker to mark the framework
                     and  all  references to it as weak imports.  It uses the <b>-weak_framework</b> option and has the
                     same linker constraints as <b>FRAMEWORK</b>.

              <b>NEEDED_LIBRARY</b>
                     This is similar to the <b>NEEDED_FRAMEWORK</b> feature, except it is for  use  with  non-framework
                     targets  or  libraries  (Apple  platforms  only).  It uses the <b>-needed_library</b> or <b>-needed-l</b>
                     option as appropriate, and has the same linker constraints as <b>NEEDED_FRAMEWORK</b>.

              <b>REEXPORT_LIBRARY</b>
                     This is similar to the <b>REEXPORT_FRAMEWORK</b> feature,  except it is for use with non-framework
                     targets or libraries (Apple platforms only).  It uses the <b>-reexport_library</b> or  <b>-reexport-l</b>
                     option as appropriate, and has the same linker constraints as <b>REEXPORT_FRAMEWORK</b>.

              <b>WEAK_LIBRARY</b>
                     This  is  similar  to  the  <b>WEAK_FRAMEWORK</b> feature, except it is for use with non-framework
                     targets or libraries (Apple platforms only).  It uses the <b>-weak_library</b> or  <b>-weak-l</b>  option
                     as appropriate, and has the same linker constraints as <b>WEAK_FRAMEWORK</b>.

              Built-in and custom library features are defined in terms of the following variables:

              • <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u>

              • <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u>

              • <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u>

              • <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u>

              The  value  used for each of these variables is the value as set at the end of the directory scope
              in which the target was created.  The usage is as follows:

              1. If the language-specific <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u> variable is  true,
                 the  <b>feature</b>  must  be  defined  by the corresponding <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u>
                 variable.

              2. If      no       language-specific       <b>feature</b>       is       supported,       then       the
                 <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u>  variable  must  be  true  and the <b>feature</b> must be
                 defined by the corresponding <u>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u> variable.

              The following limitations should be noted:

              • The <b>library-list</b> can specify CMake targets or libraries.  Any CMake target  of  type  <u>OBJECT</u>  or
                <u>INTERFACE</u> will ignore the feature aspect of the expression and instead be linked in the standard
                way.

              • The  <b>$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:...&gt;</b>  generator  expression  can only be used to specify link libraries.  In
                practice, this  means  it  can  appear  in  the  <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u>,  <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>,  and
                <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</u>   target properties, and be specified in <u>target_link_libraries()</u>
                and <u>link_libraries()</u> commands.

              • If a <b>$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:...&gt;</b> generator expression appears in the  <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>  property
                of  a target, it will be included in the imported target generated by a <u>install(EXPORT)</u> command.
                It is the responsibility of the environment consuming this import to  define  the  link  feature
                used by this expression.

              • Each  target  or  library  involved  in the link step must have at most only one kind of library
                feature.  The absence of a feature is also incompatible with all other features.  For example:

                   add_library(lib1 ...)
                   add_library(lib2 ...)
                   add_library(lib3 ...)

                   # lib1 will be associated with feature1
                   target_link_libraries(lib2 PUBLIC "$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:feature1,lib1&gt;")

                   # lib1 is being linked with no feature here. This conflicts with the
                   # use of feature1 in the line above and would result in an error.
                   target_link_libraries(lib3 PRIVATE lib1 lib2)

                Where it isn't possible to use the same feature  throughout  a  build  for  a  given  target  or
                library,  the <u>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE</u> and <u>LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE_&lt;LIBRARY&gt;</u> target properties can be
                used to resolve such incompatibilities.

              • The <b>$&lt;LINK_LIBRARY:...&gt;</b> generator expression does not  guarantee  that  the  list  of  specified
                targets  and  libraries  will be kept grouped together.  To manage constructs like <b>--start-group</b>
                and <b>--end-group</b>, as supported by the GNU <b>ld</b> linker,  use  the  <u>LINK_GROUP</u>  generator  expression
                instead.

       <b>$&lt;LINK_GROUP:feature,library-list&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Specify  a  group  of  libraries  to link to a target, along with a <b>feature</b> which defines how that
              group should be linked.  For example:

                 add_library(lib1 STATIC ...)
                 add_library(lib2 ...)
                 target_link_libraries(lib2 PRIVATE "$&lt;LINK_GROUP:RESCAN,lib1,external&gt;")

              This specifies that <b>lib2</b> should link to <b>lib1</b> and <b>external</b>, and that both of  those  two  libraries
              should be included on the linker command line according to the definition of the <b>RESCAN</b> feature.

              Feature  names  are case-sensitive and may only contain letters, numbers and underscores.  Feature
              names defined in all uppercase are reserved for CMake's own built-in features.   Currently,  there
              is only one pre-defined built-in group feature:

              <b>RESCAN</b> Some linkers are single-pass only.  For such linkers, circular references between libraries
                     typically  result  in  unresolved symbols.  This feature instructs the linker to search the
                     specified static libraries repeatedly until no new undefined references are created.

                     Normally, a static library is searched only once in the order that it is specified  on  the
                     command  line.   If  a  symbol  in  that  library  is needed to resolve an undefined symbol
                     referred to by an object in a library that appears later on the command  line,  the  linker
                     would  not  be  able  to resolve that reference.  By grouping the static libraries with the
                     <b>RESCAN</b> feature, they will all be searched repeatedly  until  all  possible  references  are
                     resolved.  This will use linker options like <b>--start-group</b> and <b>--end-group</b>, or on SunOS, <b>-z</b>
                     <b>rescan-start</b> and <b>-z</b> <b>rescan-end</b>.

                     Using this feature has a significant performance cost. It is best to use it only when there
                     are unavoidable circular references between two or more static libraries.

                     This  feature is available when using toolchains that target Linux, BSD, and SunOS.  It can
                     also be used when targeting Windows platforms if the GNU toolchain is used.

              Built-in and custom group features are defined in terms of the following variables:

              • <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u>

              • <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u>

              • <u>CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u>

              • <u>CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u>

              The value used for each of these variables is the value as set at the end of the  directory  scope
              in which the target was created.  The usage is as follows:

              1. If  the  language-specific  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u> variable is true,
                 the <b>feature</b>  must  be  defined  by  the  corresponding  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u>
                 variable.

              2. If       no       language-specific       <b>feature</b>       is       supported,       then      the
                 <u>CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_SUPPORTED</u> variable must  be  true  and  the  <b>feature</b>  must  be
                 defined by the corresponding <u>CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</u> variable.

              The  <b>LINK_GROUP</b> generator expression is compatible with the <u>LINK_LIBRARY</u> generator expression. The
              libraries involved in a group can be specified using the <u>LINK_LIBRARY</u> generator expression.

              Each target or external library involved in the link step  is  allowed  to  be  part  of  multiple
              groups,  but  only  if  all the groups involved specify the same <b>feature</b>.  Such groups will not be
              merged on the linker command  line,  the  individual  groups  will  still  be  preserved.   Mixing
              different group features for the same target or library is forbidden.

                 add_library(lib1 ...)
                 add_library(lib2 ...)
                 add_library(lib3 ...)
                 add_library(lib4 ...)
                 add_library(lib5 ...)

                 target_link_libraries(lib3 PUBLIC  "$&lt;LINK_GROUP:feature1,lib1,lib2&gt;")
                 target_link_libraries(lib4 PRIVATE "$&lt;LINK_GROUP:feature1,lib1,lib3&gt;")
                 # lib4 will be linked with the groups {lib1,lib2} and {lib1,lib3}.
                 # Both groups specify the same feature, so this is fine.

                 target_link_libraries(lib5 PRIVATE "$&lt;LINK_GROUP:feature2,lib1,lib3&gt;")
                 # An error will be raised here because both lib1 and lib3 are part of two
                 # groups with different features.

              When  a  target or an external library is involved in the link step as part of a group and also as
              not part of any group, any occurrence of the non-group link item will be replaced by the groups it
              belongs to.

                 add_library(lib1 ...)
                 add_library(lib2 ...)
                 add_library(lib3 ...)
                 add_library(lib4 ...)

                 target_link_libraries(lib3 PUBLIC lib1)

                 target_link_libraries(lib4 PRIVATE lib3 "$&lt;LINK_GROUP:feature1,lib1,lib2&gt;")
                 # lib4 will only be linked with lib3 and the group {lib1,lib2}

              Because <b>lib1</b> is part of the group defined for <b>lib4</b>, that group then gets applied back to  the  use
              of  <b>lib1</b>  for  <b>lib3</b>.   The end result will be as though the linking relationship for <b>lib3</b> had been
              specified as:

                 target_link_libraries(lib3 PUBLIC "$&lt;LINK_GROUP:feature1,lib1,lib2&gt;")

              Be aware that the precedence of the group over the non-group link  item  can  result  in  circular
              dependencies  between  groups.   If  this  occurs,  a  fatal  error  is  raised  because  circular
              dependencies are not allowed for groups.

                 add_library(lib1A ...)
                 add_library(lib1B ...)
                 add_library(lib2A ...)
                 add_library(lib2B ...)
                 add_library(lib3 ...)

                 # Non-group linking relationships, these are non-circular so far
                 target_link_libraries(lib1A PUBLIC lib2A)
                 target_link_libraries(lib2B PUBLIC lib1B)

                 # The addition of these groups creates circular dependencies
                 target_link_libraries(lib3 PRIVATE
                   "$&lt;LINK_GROUP:feat,lib1A,lib1B&gt;"
                   "$&lt;LINK_GROUP:feat,lib2A,lib2B&gt;"
                 )

              Because of the groups defined for <b>lib3</b>, the linking relationships for <b>lib1A</b> and <b>lib2B</b>  effectively
              get expanded to the equivalent of:

                 target_link_libraries(lib1A PUBLIC "$&lt;LINK_GROUP:feat,lib2A,lib2B&gt;")
                 target_link_libraries(lib2B PUBLIC "$&lt;LINK_GROUP:feat,lib1A,lib1B&gt;")

              This creates a circular dependency between groups: <b>lib1A</b> <b>--&gt;</b> <b>lib2B</b> <b>--&gt;</b> <b>lib1A</b>.

              The following limitations should also be noted:

              • The  <b>library-list</b>  can  specify  CMake targets or libraries.  Any CMake target of type <u>OBJECT</u> or
                <u>INTERFACE</u> will ignore the feature aspect of the expression and instead be linked in the standard
                way.

              • The <b>$&lt;LINK_GROUP:...&gt;</b> generator expression can only be  used  to  specify  link  libraries.   In
                practice,   this  means  it  can  appear  in  the  <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u>,  <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>,and
                <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT</u> target properties, and be specified  in  <u>target_link_libraries()</u>
                and <u>link_libraries()</u> commands.

              • If  a <b>$&lt;LINK_GROUP:...&gt;</b> generator expression appears in the <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> property of
                a target, it will be included in the imported target generated by a <u>install(EXPORT)</u> command.  It
                is the responsibility of the environment consuming this import to define the link  feature  used
                by this expression.

   <b>Link</b> <b>Context</b>
       <b>$&lt;LINK_ONLY:...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.1.

              Content  of <b>...</b>, except while collecting usage requirements from <u>transitive</u> <u>compile</u> <u>properties</u>, in
              which case it is the empty string.  This is intended for use in an <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> target
              property, typically populated via the <u>target_link_libraries()</u> command,  to  specify  private  link
              dependencies without other usage requirements such as include directories or compile options.

              Added in version 3.24: <b>LINK_ONLY</b> may also be used in a <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u> target property.  See policy
              <u>CMP0131</u>.

       <b>$&lt;DEVICE_LINK:list&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              Returns  the list if it is the device link step, an empty list otherwise.  The device link step is
              controlled by <u>CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION</u> and  <u>CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS</u>  properties  and  policy
              <u>CMP0105</u>. This expression can only be used to specify link options.

       <b>$&lt;HOST_LINK:list&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              Returns  the  list  if  it  is  the normal link step, an empty list otherwise.  This expression is
              mainly useful when a  device  link  step  is  also  involved  (see  <u>$&lt;DEVICE_LINK:list&gt;</u>  generator
              expression). This expression can only be used to specify link options.

   <b>Target-Dependent</b> <b>Expressions</b>
   <b>Target</b> <b>Meta-Data</b>
       These expressions look up information about a target.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_EXISTS:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              <b>1</b> if <b>tgt</b> exists as a CMake target, else <b>0</b>.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_NAME_IF_EXISTS:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              The target name <b>tgt</b> if the target exists, an empty string otherwise.

              Note that <b>tgt</b> is not added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_NAME:tgt&gt;</b>
              The  target  name  <b>tgt</b>  as  written.  This marks <b>tgt</b> as being the name of a target inside a larger
              expression, which is required if exporting targets to multiple dependent  export  sets.   The  <b>tgt</b>
              text  must  be  a  literal name of a target; it may not contain generator expressions.  The target
              does not have to exist.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:policy&gt;</b>
              <b>1</b> if the <b>policy</b> was <b>NEW</b> when the 'head' target was created, else <b>0</b>.  If the <b>policy</b>  was  not  set,
              the  warning  message  for  the policy will be emitted. This generator expression only works for a
              subset of policies.

   <b>Target</b> <b>Properties</b>
       These expressions look up the values of <u>target</u> <u>properties</u>.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt;</b>
              Value of the property <b>prop</b> on the target <b>tgt</b>, or empty if the property is not set.

              Note that <b>tgt</b> is not added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on.

              Changed in version  3.26:  When  encountered  during  evaluation  of  <u>Target</u>  <u>Usage</u>  <u>Requirements</u>,
              typically in an <b>INTERFACE_*</b> target property, lookup of the <b>tgt</b> name occurs in the directory of the
              target specifying the requirement, rather than the directory of the consuming target for which the
              expression is being evaluated.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt;</b>
              Value  of the property <b>prop</b> on the target for which the expression is being evaluated, or empty if
              the property is not set.  Note that for generator expressions in <u>Target</u> <u>Usage</u> <u>Requirements</u> this is
              the consuming target rather than the target specifying the requirement.

       The expressions have special evaluation rules for some properties:

       <u>Target</u> <u>Build</u> <u>Specification</u> <u>Properties</u>
              These evaluate as a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> representing the union of the  value  on  the  target
              itself  with  the  values  of  the corresponding <u>Target</u> <u>Usage</u> <u>Requirements</u> on targets named by the
              target's <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u>:

              • For <u>Target</u> <u>Compile</u> <u>Properties</u>, evaluation of corresponding usage requirements is transitive over
                the closure of the linked targets' <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> <u>excluding</u>  entries  guarded  by  the
                <u>LINK_ONLY</u> generator expression.

              • For  <u>Target</u>  <u>Link</u>  <u>Properties</u>, evaluation of corresponding usage requirements is transitive over
                the closure of the linked targets' <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> <u>including</u>  entries  guarded  by  the
                <u>LINK_ONLY</u> generator expression.  See policy <u>CMP0166</u>.

              Evaluation of <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u> itself is not transitive.

       <u>Target</u> <u>Usage</u> <u>Requirement</u> <u>Properties</u>
              These  evaluate  as  a  <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> representing the union of the value on the target
              itself  with  the  values  of  the  same   properties   on   targets   named   by   the   target's
              <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>:

              • For  <u>Transitive</u>  <u>Compile</u>  <u>Properties</u>,  evaluation is transitive over the closure of the target's
                <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> <u>excluding</u> entries guarded by the <u>LINK_ONLY</u> generator expression.

              • For <u>Transitive</u> <u>Link</u> <u>Properties</u>, evaluation is  transitive  over  the  closure  of  the  target's
                <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>  <u>including</u>  entries guarded by the <u>LINK_ONLY</u> generator expression.  See
                policy <u>CMP0166</u>.

              Evaluation of <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u> itself is not transitive.

       <u>Custom</u> <u>Transitive</u> <u>Properties</u>
              Added in version 3.30.

              These are processed during evaluation as follows:

              • Evaluation of <u>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,PROP&gt;</u> for some property <b>PROP</b>, named  without  an  <b>INTERFACE_</b>
                prefix,  checks  the  <u>TRANSITIVE_COMPILE_PROPERTIES</u> and <u>TRANSITIVE_LINK_PROPERTIES</u> properties on
                target <b>tgt</b>, on targets named by its <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u>, and on the  transitive  closure  of  targets
                named by the linked targets' <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>.

                If  <b>PROP</b>  is  listed by one of those properties, then it evaluates as a <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u>
                representing the union of the value on the target itself with the values  of  the  corresponding
                <b>INTERFACE_PROP</b> on targets named by the target's <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u>:

                • If   <b>PROP</b>   is   named  by  <u>TRANSITIVE_COMPILE_PROPERTIES</u>,  evaluation  of  the  corresponding
                  <b>INTERFACE_PROP</b> is transitive over the closure of the linked targets' <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>,
                  excluding entries guarded by the <u>LINK_ONLY</u> generator expression.

                • If <b>PROP</b> is named by <u>TRANSITIVE_LINK_PROPERTIES</u>, evaluation of the corresponding <b>INTERFACE_PROP</b>
                  is transitive over the closure of  the  linked  targets'  <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>,  including
                  entries guarded by the <u>LINK_ONLY</u> generator expression.

              • Evaluation of <u>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,INTERFACE_PROP&gt;</u> for some property <b>INTERFACE_PROP</b>, named with
                an  <b>INTERFACE_</b>  prefix,  checks the <u>TRANSITIVE_COMPILE_PROPERTIES</u> and <u>TRANSITIVE_LINK_PROPERTIES</u>
                properties  on  target  <b>tgt</b>,  and  on  the  transitive  closure  of   targets   named   by   its
                <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>.

                If the corresponding <b>PROP</b> is listed by one of those properties, then <b>INTERFACE_PROP</b> evaluates as
                a  <u>semicolon-separated</u>  <u>list</u>  representing  the union of the value on the target itself with the
                value of the same property on targets named by the target's <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>:

                • If  <b>PROP</b>  is  named  by  <u>TRANSITIVE_COMPILE_PROPERTIES</u>,  evaluation   of   the   corresponding
                  <b>INTERFACE_PROP</b>  is  transitive  over  the  closure  of  the target's <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>,
                  excluding entries guarded by the <u>LINK_ONLY</u> generator expression.

                • If <b>PROP</b> is named by <u>TRANSITIVE_LINK_PROPERTIES</u>, evaluation of the corresponding <b>INTERFACE_PROP</b>
                  is transitive over the closure of the  target's  <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>,  including  entries
                  guarded by the <u>LINK_ONLY</u> generator expression.

              If  a  <b>PROP</b>  is  named  by  both <u>TRANSITIVE_COMPILE_PROPERTIES</u> and <u>TRANSITIVE_LINK_PROPERTIES</u>, the
              latter takes precedence.

       <u>Compatible</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>Properties</u>
              These evaluate as a single value combined from the  target  itself,  from  targets  named  by  the
              target's   <u>LINK_LIBRARIES</u>,   and   from   the   transitive   closure   of   the   linked  targets'
              <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>.  Values of a compatible interface property from multiple targets combine
              based on the type of compatibility required by the <b>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_*</b> property defining it.

   <b>Target</b> <b>Artifacts</b>
       These expressions look up information about  artifacts  associated  with  a  given  target  <b>tgt</b>.   Unless
       otherwise stated, this can be any runtime artifact, namely:

       • An executable target created by <u>add_executable()</u>.

       • A shared library target (<b>.so</b>, <b>.dll</b> but not their <b>.lib</b> import library) created by <u>add_library()</u>.

       • A static library target created by <u>add_library()</u>.

       In  the  following,  the  phrase "the <b>tgt</b> filename" means the name of the <b>tgt</b> binary file. This has to be
       distinguished from the phrase "the target name", which is just the string <b>tgt</b>.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt;</b>
              Full path to the <b>tgt</b> binary file.

              Note that <b>tgt</b> is not added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated  on,  unless
              the expression is being used in <u>add_custom_command()</u> or <u>add_custom_target()</u>.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_BASE_NAME:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              Base name of <b>tgt</b>, i.e. <b>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</b> without prefix and suffix.  For example, if the <b>tgt</b>
              filename is <b>libbase.so</b>, the base name is <b>base</b>.

              See  also the <u>OUTPUT_NAME</u>, <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME</u>, <u>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME</u> and <u>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME</u> target
              properties     and     their     configuration     specific     variants     <u>OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>,
              <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>, <u>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> and <u>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>.

              The <u>&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX</u> and <u>DEBUG_POSTFIX</u> target properties can also be considered.

              Note that <b>tgt</b> is not added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_PREFIX:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              Prefix of the <b>tgt</b> filename (such as <b>lib</b>).

              See also the <u>PREFIX</u> target property.

              Note that <b>tgt</b> is not added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_SUFFIX:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              Suffix of the <b>tgt</b> filename (extension such as <b>.so</b> or <b>.exe</b>).

              See also the <u>SUFFIX</u> target property.

              Note that <b>tgt</b> is not added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</b>
              The <b>tgt</b> filename.

              Note  that  <b>tgt</b>  is  not  added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on (see
              policy <u>CMP0112</u>).

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;</b>
              Directory of the <b>tgt</b> binary file.

              Note that <b>tgt</b> is not added as a dependency of the target this  expression  is  evaluated  on  (see
              policy <u>CMP0112</u>).

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_IMPORT_FILE:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              Full  path to the linker import file. On DLL platforms, it would be the <b>.lib</b> file. For executables
              on AIX, and for shared libraries on macOS, it could be, respectively,  the  <b>.imp</b>  or  <b>.tbd</b>  import
              file, depending on the value of the <u>ENABLE_EXPORTS</u> property.

              This expands to an empty string when there is no import file associated with the target.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_IMPORT_FILE_BASE_NAME:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              Base  name  of  the linker import file of the target <b>tgt</b> without prefix or suffix. For example, if
              the target file name is <b>libbase.tbd</b>, the base name is <b>base</b>.

              See also the  <u>OUTPUT_NAME</u>  and  <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME</u>  target  properties  and  their  configuration
              specific variants <u>OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> and <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>.

              The <u>&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX</u> and <u>DEBUG_POSTFIX</u> target properties can also be considered.

              Note that <b>tgt</b> is not added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_IMPORT_FILE_PREFIX:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              Prefix of the import file of the target <b>tgt</b>.

              See also the <u>IMPORT_PREFIX</u> target property.

              Note that <b>tgt</b> is not added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_IMPORT_FILE_SUFFIX:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              Suffix of the import file of the target <b>tgt</b>.

              The suffix corresponds to the file extension (such as <b>.lib</b> or <b>.tbd</b>).

              See also the <u>IMPORT_SUFFIX</u> target property.

              Note that <b>tgt</b> is not added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_IMPORT_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              Name of the import file of the target <b>tgt</b>.

              Note that <b>tgt</b> is not added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_IMPORT_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              Directory of the import file of the target <b>tgt</b>.

              Note that <b>tgt</b> is not added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt;</b>
              File  used  when  linking to the <b>tgt</b> target.  This will usually be the library that <b>tgt</b> represents
              (<b>.a</b>, <b>.lib</b>, <b>.so</b>), but for a shared library on DLL platforms, it would be the  <b>.lib</b>  import  library
              associated with the DLL.

              Added  in  version  3.27:  On  macOS,  it could be the <b>.tbd</b> import file associated with the shared
              library, depending on the value of the <u>ENABLE_EXPORTS</u> property.

              This    generator    expression    is    equivalent    to     <u>$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_LIBRARY_FILE&gt;</u>     or
              <u>$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_IMPORT_FILE&gt;</u> generator expressions, depending on the characteristics of the target
              and the platform.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_BASE_NAME:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              Base name of file used to link the target <b>tgt</b>, i.e.  <u>$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</u> without prefix
              and suffix. For example, if target file name is <b>libbase.a</b>, the base name is <b>base</b>.

              See also the <u>OUTPUT_NAME</u>, <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME</u>, and <u>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME</u> target properties and their
              configuration    specific    variants   <u>OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>,   <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>   and
              <u>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>.

              The <u>&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX</u> and <u>DEBUG_POSTFIX</u> target properties can also be considered.

              Note that <b>tgt</b> is not added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_PREFIX:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              Prefix of file used to link target <b>tgt</b>.

              See also the <u>PREFIX</u> and <u>IMPORT_PREFIX</u> target properties.

              Note that <b>tgt</b> is not added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on.

              Added in version 3.15.

              Suffix of file used to link where <b>tgt</b> is the name of a target.

              The suffix corresponds to the file extension (such as ".so" or ".lib").

              See also the <u>SUFFIX</u> and <u>IMPORT_SUFFIX</u> target properties.

              Added in version 3.27.

              File used when linking o the <b>tgt</b> target is done using directly the  library,  and  not  an  import
              file.  This  will  usually  be  the  library  that  <b>tgt</b>  represents  (<b>.a</b>, <b>.so</b>, <b>.dylib</b>). So, on DLL
              platforms, it will be an empty string.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_LIBRARY_FILE_BASE_NAME:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              Base    name    of    library    file    used     to     link     the     target     <b>tgt</b>,     i.e.
              <u>$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_LIBRARY_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</u>  without  prefix  and  suffix.  For example, if target file
              name is <b>libbase.a</b>, the base name is <b>base</b>.

              See also the <u>OUTPUT_NAME</u>, <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME</u>, and <u>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME</u> target properties and their

              Note that <b>tgt</b> is not added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_LIBRARY_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              Directory of the library file used to link target <b>tgt</b>.

              Note that <b>tgt</b> is not added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_IMPORT_FILE:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              File  used  when linking to the <b>tgt</b> target is done using an import file.  This will usually be the
              import file that <b>tgt</b> represents (<b>.lib</b>, <b>.tbd</b>). So, when no import file  is  involved  in  the  link
              step, an empty string is returned.

              Added in version 3.27.

              Base    name    of    the    import    file    used    to    link    the    target    <b>tgt</b>,    i.e.
              <u>$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_IMPORT_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</u> without prefix and suffix.  For example, if target file name
              is <b>libbase.tbd</b>, the base name is <b>base</b>.

              See also the <u>OUTPUT_NAME</u>  and  <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME</u>,  target  properties  and  their  configuration
              specific variants <u>OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u> and <u>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>.

              Added in version 3.9.

              Full path to the bundle content directory where <b>tgt</b> is the name of a target.  For the macOS SDK it
              leads to <b>/path/to/my.app/Contents</b>, <b>/path/to/my.framework</b>, or <b>/path/to/my.bundle/Contents</b>.  For all
              other SDKs (e.g. iOS) it leads to <b>/path/to/my.app</b>,  <b>/path/to/my.framework</b>,  or  <b>/path/to/my.bundle</b>
              due to the flat bundle structure.

              Note  that  <b>tgt</b>  is  not  added as a dependency of the target this expression is evaluated on (see
              policy <u>CMP0112</u>).

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.1.

              targets.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_RUNTIME_DLLS:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              List of DLLs that the target depends on at runtime. This is determined by the locations of all the
              <b>SHARED</b>  targets  in  the target's transitive dependencies. If only the directories of the DLLs are
              needed, see the <u>TARGET_RUNTIME_DLL_DIRS</u> generator expression.  Using this generator expression  on
              targets  other  than  executables, <b>SHARED</b> libraries, and <b>MODULE</b> libraries is an error.  <b>On</b> <b>non-DLL</b>
              <b>platforms,</b> <b>this</b> <b>expression</b> <b>always</b> <b>evaluates</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> <b>string</b>.

              This generator expression can be used to copy all of the DLLs that a target depends  on  into  its
              output directory in a <b>POST_BUILD</b> custom command using the <u>cmake</u> <u>-E</u> <u>copy</u> <u>-t</u> command. For example:

                 find_package(foo CONFIG REQUIRED) # package generated by install(EXPORT)

                 add_executable(exe main.c)
                 target_link_libraries(exe PRIVATE foo::foo foo::bar)
                 add_custom_command(TARGET exe POST_BUILD
                   COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy -t $&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:exe&gt; $&lt;TARGET_RUNTIME_DLLS:exe&gt;
                   COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS
                 )

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> are supported only if they know the location of their <b>.dll</b> files.  An imported
                 <b>SHARED</b>  library must have <u>IMPORTED_LOCATION</u> set to its <b>.dll</b> file.  See the <u>add_library</u> <u>imported</u>
                 <u>libraries</u> section for details.  Many <u>Find</u> <u>Modules</u> produce imported  targets  with  the  <b>UNKNOWN</b>
                 type and therefore will be ignored.

              On  platforms  that support runtime paths (<b>RPATH</b>), refer to the <u>INSTALL_RPATH</u> target property.  On
              Apple platforms, refer to the <u>INSTALL_NAME_DIR</u> target property.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_RUNTIME_DLL_DIRS:tgt&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              List of the directories which contain the  DLLs  that  the  target  depends  on  at  runtime  (see
              <u>TARGET_RUNTIME_DLLS</u>).  This  is  determined  by  the  locations  of  all the <b>SHARED</b> targets in the
              target's  transitive  dependencies.  Using  this  generator  expression  on  targets  other   than
              executables,  <b>SHARED</b>  libraries,  and  <b>MODULE</b>  libraries  is an error.  <b>On</b> <b>non-DLL</b> <b>platforms,</b> <b>this</b>
              <b>expression</b> <b>always</b> <b>evaluates</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> <b>string</b>.

              This generator expression can e.g. be used to create a batch file using <u>file(GENERATE)</u> which  sets
              the PATH environment variable accordingly.

   <b>Export</b> <b>And</b> <b>Install</b> <b>Expressions</b>
       <b>$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt;</b>
              Content of <b>...</b> when the property is exported using <u>install(EXPORT)</u>, and empty otherwise.

       <b>$&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt;</b>
              Content of <b>...</b> when the property is exported using <u>export()</u>, or when the target is used by another
              target in the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.

       <b>$&lt;BUILD_LOCAL_INTERFACE:...&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.26.

              Content  of  <b>...</b> when the target is used by another target in the same buildsystem. Expands to the
              empty string otherwise.

       <b>$&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt;</b>
              Content of the install prefix when the target is exported via <u>install(EXPORT)</u>, or  when  evaluated
              in     the     <u>INSTALL_NAME_DIR</u>     property     or     the     <b>INSTALL_NAME_DIR</b>    argument    of
              <u>install(RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET)</u>, and empty otherwise.

              Changed in version 3.27: Evaluates to the content of the install prefix in the  code  argument  of
              <u>install(CODE)</u> or the file argument of <u>install(SCRIPT)</u>.

   <b>Multi-level</b> <b>Expression</b> <b>Evaluation</b>
       <b>$&lt;GENEX_EVAL:expr&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              Content  of  <b>expr</b>  evaluated  as  a  generator  expression  in  the  current context. This enables
              consumption of generator expressions whose evaluation results itself in generator expressions.

       <b>$&lt;TARGET_GENEX_EVAL:tgt,expr&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              Content of <b>expr</b> evaluated as a generator expression in the context of  <b>tgt</b>  target.  This  enables
              consumption of custom target properties that themselves contain generator expressions.

              Having  the  capability  to  evaluate generator expressions is very useful when you want to manage
              custom properties supporting generator expressions.  For example:

                 add_library(foo ...)

                 set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY
                   CUSTOM_KEYS $&lt;$&lt;CONFIG:DEBUG&gt;:FOO_EXTRA_THINGS&gt;
                 )

                 add_custom_target(printFooKeys
                   COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo $&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,CUSTOM_KEYS&gt;
                 )

              This naive implementation of the <b>printFooKeys</b> custom command is wrong because  <b>CUSTOM_KEYS</b>  target
              property     is     not    evaluated    and    the    content    is    passed    as    is    (i.e.
              <b>$&lt;$&lt;CONFIG:DEBUG&gt;:FOO_EXTRA_THINGS&gt;</b>).

              To have the expected result (i.e. <b>FOO_EXTRA_THINGS</b> if config is <b>Debug</b>), it is required to evaluate
              the output of <b>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,CUSTOM_KEYS&gt;</b>:

                 add_custom_target(printFooKeys
                   COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E
                     echo $&lt;TARGET_GENEX_EVAL:foo,$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,CUSTOM_KEYS&gt;&gt;
                 )

   <b>Escaped</b> <b>Characters</b>
       These expressions evaluate to specific string literals. Use them in place of the  actual  string  literal
       where you need to prevent them from having their special meaning.

       <b>$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt;</b>
              A literal <b>&gt;</b>. Used for example to compare strings that contain a <b>&gt;</b>.

       <b>$&lt;COMMA&gt;</b>
              A literal <b>,</b>. Used for example to compare strings which contain a <b>,</b>.

       <b>$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt;</b>
              A literal <b>;</b>. Used to prevent list expansion on an argument with <b>;</b>.

       <b>$&lt;QUOTE&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.30.

              A literal <b>"</b>. Used to allow string literal quotes inside a generator expression.
