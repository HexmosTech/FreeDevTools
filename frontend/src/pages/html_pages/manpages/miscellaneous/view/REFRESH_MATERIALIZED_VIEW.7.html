</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       REFRESH_MATERIALIZED_VIEW - replace the contents of a materialized view

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW [ CONCURRENTLY ] <u>name</u>
           [ WITH [ NO ] DATA ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>REFRESH</b> <b>MATERIALIZED</b> <b>VIEW</b> completely replaces the contents of a materialized view. To execute this
       command you must have the MAINTAIN privilege on the materialized view. The old contents are discarded. If
       WITH DATA is specified (or defaults) the backing query is executed to provide the new data, and the
       materialized view is left in a scannable state. If WITH NO DATA is specified no new data is generated and
       the materialized view is left in an unscannable state.

       CONCURRENTLY and WITH NO DATA may not be specified together.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       CONCURRENTLY
           Refresh the materialized view without locking out concurrent selects on the materialized view.
           Without this option a refresh which affects a lot of rows will tend to use fewer resources and
           complete more quickly, but could block other connections which are trying to read from the
           materialized view. This option may be faster in cases where a small number of rows are affected.

           This option is only allowed if there is at least one UNIQUE index on the materialized view which uses
           only column names and includes all rows; that is, it must not be an expression index or include a
           WHERE clause.

           This option can only be used when the materialized view is already populated.

           Even with this option only one REFRESH at a time may run against any one materialized view.

       <u>name</u>
           The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the materialized view to refresh.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       If there is an ORDER BY clause in the materialized view's defining query, the original contents of the
       materialized view will be ordered that way; but <b>REFRESH</b> <b>MATERIALIZED</b> <b>VIEW</b> does not guarantee to preserve
       that ordering.

       While <b>REFRESH</b> <b>MATERIALIZED</b> <b>VIEW</b> is running, the search_path is temporarily changed to pg_catalog,
       pg_temp.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This command will replace the contents of the materialized view called order_summary using the query from
       the materialized view's definition, and leave it in a scannable state:

           REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW order_summary;

       This command will free storage associated with the materialized view annual_statistics_basis and leave it
       in an unscannable state:

           REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW annual_statistics_basis WITH NO DATA;

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>REFRESH</b> <b>MATERIALIZED</b> <b>VIEW</b> is a PostgreSQL extension.
