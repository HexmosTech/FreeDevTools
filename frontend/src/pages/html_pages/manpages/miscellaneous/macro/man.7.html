       man - macros to format man pages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>groff</b> <b>-Tascii</b> <b>-man</b> <u>file</u> ...

       <b>groff</b> <b>-Tps</b> <b>-man</b> <u>file</u> ...

       <b>man</b> [<u>section</u>] <u>title</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  explains  the <b>groff</b> <b>an.tmac</b> macro package (often called the <b>man</b> macro package).  This
       macro package should be used by developers when writing or porting man pages for  Linux.   It  is  fairly
       compatible  with other versions of this macro package, so porting man pages should not be a major problem
       (exceptions include the NET-2 BSD release, which uses a totally different macro package called mdoc;  see
       <b><a href="../man7/mdoc.7.html">mdoc</a></b>(7)).

       Note  that  NET-2 BSD mdoc man pages can be used with <b>groff</b> simply by specifying the <b>-mdoc</b> option instead
       of the <b>-man</b> option.  Using the <b>-mandoc</b> option is, however, recommended,  since  this  will  automatically
       detect which macro package is in use.

       For  conventions  that  should  be  employed  when writing man pages for the Linux <u>man-pages</u> package, see
       <b><a href="../man7/man-pages.7.html">man-pages</a></b>(7).

   <b>Title</b> <b>line</b>
       The first command in a man page (after comment lines, that is, lines that start with <b>.\"</b>) should be

              <b>.TH</b> <u>title</u> <u>section</u> <u>date</u> <u>source</u> <u>manual</u>

       For details of the arguments that should be supplied to the <b>TH</b> command, see <b><a href="../man7/man-pages.7.html">man-pages</a></b>(7).

       Note that BSD mdoc-formatted pages begin with the <b>Dd</b> command, not the <b>TH</b> command.

   <b>Sections</b>
       Sections are started with <b>.SH</b> followed by the heading name.

       The only mandatory heading is NAME, which should be the first section and be followed on the next line by
       a one-line description of the program:

              .SH NAME
              item \- description

       It is extremely important that this format is followed, and that there is a backslash before  the  single
       dash  which  follows  the item name.  This syntax is used by the <b><a href="../man8/mandb.8.html">mandb</a></b>(8) program to create a database of
       short descriptions for the <b><a href="../man1/whatis.1.html">whatis</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/apropos.1.html">apropos</a></b>(1) commands.  (See <b><a href="../man1/lexgrog.1.html">lexgrog</a></b>(1) for further details on the
       syntax of the NAME section.)

       For a list of other sections that might appear in a manual page, see <b><a href="../man7/man-pages.7.html">man-pages</a></b>(7).

   <b>Fonts</b>
       The commands to select the type face are:

       <b>.B</b>  Bold

       <b>.BI</b> Bold alternating with italics (especially useful for function specifications)

       <b>.BR</b> Bold alternating with Roman (especially useful for referring to other manual pages)

       <b>.I</b>  Italics

       <b>.IB</b> Italics alternating with bold

       <b>.IR</b> Italics alternating with Roman

       <b>.RB</b> Roman alternating with bold

       <b>.RI</b> Roman alternating with italics

       <b>.SB</b> Small alternating with bold

       <b>.SM</b> Small (useful for acronyms)

       Traditionally, each command can have up to  six  arguments,  but  the  GNU  implementation  removes  this
       limitation (you might still want to limit yourself to 6 arguments for portability's sake).  Arguments are
       delimited  by  spaces.   Double quotes can be used to specify an argument which contains spaces.  For the
       macros that produce alternating type faces, the arguments will be printed  next  to  each  other  without
       intervening  spaces,  so that the <b>.BR</b> command can be used to specify a word in bold followed by a mark of
       punctuation in Roman.  If no arguments are given, the command is applied to the following line of text.

   <b>Other</b> <b>macros</b> <b>and</b> <b>strings</b>
       Below are other relevant macros and predefined strings.  Unless noted otherwise, all macros cause a break
       (end the current line of text).   Many  of  these  macros  set  or  use  the  "prevailing  indent."   The
       "prevailing indent" value is set by any macro with the parameter <u>i</u> below; macros may omit <u>i</u> in which case
       the current prevailing indent will be used.  As a result, successive indented paragraphs can use the same
       indent  without  respecifying  the  indent value.  A normal (nonindented) paragraph resets the prevailing
       indent value to its default value (0.5 inches).  By default, a given indent is measured in  ens;  try  to
       use  ens  or  ems  as units for indents, since these will automatically adjust to font size changes.  The
       other key macro definitions are:

   <b>Normal</b> <b>paragraphs</b>
       <b>.LP</b>      Same as <b>.PP</b> (begin a new paragraph).

       <b>.P</b>       Same as <b>.PP</b> (begin a new paragraph).

       <b>.PP</b>      Begin a new paragraph and reset prevailing indent.

   <b>Relative</b> <b>margin</b> <b>indent</b>
       <b>.RS</b> <u>i</u>    Start relative margin indent: moves the left margin <u>i</u>  to  the  right  (if  <u>i</u>  is  omitted,  the
                prevailing  indent  value is used).  A new prevailing indent is set to 0.5 inches.  As a result,
                all following paragraph(s) will be indented until the corresponding <b>.RE</b>.

       <b>.RE</b>      End relative margin indent and restores the previous value of the prevailing indent.

   <b>Indented</b> <b>paragraph</b> <b>macros</b>
       <b>.HP</b> <u>i</u>    Begin paragraph with a hanging indent (the first line of the paragraph is at the left margin  of
                normal paragraphs, and the rest of the paragraph's lines are indented).

       <b>.IP</b> <u>x</u> <u>i</u>  Indented  paragraph  with  optional  hanging tag.  If the tag <u>x</u> is omitted, the entire following
                paragraph is indented by <u>i</u>.  If the tag <u>x</u> is provided, it is hung at the left margin before  the
                following  indented paragraph (this is just like <b>.TP</b> except the tag is included with the command
                instead of being on the following line).  If the tag is too long, the text after the tag will be
                moved down to the next line (text will not be lost or garbled).  For bulleted  lists,  use  this
                macro with \(bu (bullet) or \(em (em dash) as the tag, and for numbered lists, use the number or
                letter followed by a period as the tag; this simplifies translation to other formats.

       <b>.TP</b> <u>i</u>    Begin  paragraph  with hanging tag.  The tag is given on the next line, but its results are like
                those of the <b>.IP</b> command.

   <b>Hypertext</b> <b>link</b> <b>macros</b>
       <b>.UR</b> <u>url</u>
              Insert a hypertext link to the URI (URL) <u>url</u>, with all text up to the following <b>.UE</b> macro  as  the
              link text.

       <b>.UE</b>    [<u>trailer</u>]  Terminate  the  link  text  of  the  preceding <b>.UR</b> macro, with the optional <u>trailer</u> (if
              present, usually a closing parenthesis and/or end-of-sentence punctuation) immediately  following.
              For  non-HTML  output  devices  (e.g.,  <b>man</b> <b>-Tutf8</b>), the link text is followed by the URL in angle
              brackets; if there is no link text, the URL is printed as its own link text, surrounded  by  angle
              brackets.   (Angle  brackets  may  not  be  available on all output devices.)  For the HTML output
              device, the link text is hyperlinked to the URL; if there is no link text, the URL is  printed  as
              its own link text.

       These  macros  have  been  supported  since GNU Troff 1.20 (2009-01-05) and Heirloom Doctools Troff since
       160217 (2016-02-17).

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>macros</b>
       <b>.DT</b>      Reset tabs to default tab values (every 0.5 inches); does not cause a break.

       <b>.PD</b> <u>d</u>    Set inter-paragraph vertical distance to d (if omitted, d=0.4v); does not cause a break.

       <b>.SS</b> <u>t</u>    Subheading <u>t</u> (like <b>.SH</b>, but used for a subsection inside a section).

   <b>Predefined</b> <b>strings</b>
       The <b>man</b> package has the following predefined strings:

       \*R    Registration Symbol: ®

       \*S    Change to default font size

       \*(Tm  Trademark Symbol: ™

       \*(lq  Left angled double quote: “

       \*(rq  Right angled double quote: ”

   <b>Safe</b> <b>subset</b>
       Although technically <b>man</b> is a troff macro package, in reality a large number of other tools  process  man
       page  files that don't implement all of troff's abilities.  Thus, it's best to avoid some of troff's more
       exotic abilities where possible to permit these other tools to work correctly.  Avoid using  the  various
       troff  preprocessors (if you must, go ahead and use <b><a href="../man1/tbl.1.html">tbl</a></b>(1), but try to use the <b>IP</b> and <b>TP</b> commands instead
       for two-column tables).  Avoid using computations; most other  tools  can't  process  them.   Use  simple
       commands that are easy to translate to other formats.  The following troff macros are believed to be safe
       (though  in  many  cases they will be ignored by translators): <b>\"</b>, <b>.</b>, <b>ad</b>, <b>bp</b>, <b>br</b>, <b>ce</b>, <b>de</b>, <b>ds</b>, <b>el</b>, <b>ie</b>, <b>if</b>,
       <b>fi</b>, <b>ft</b>, <b>hy</b>, <b>ig</b>, <b>in</b>, <b>na</b>, <b>ne</b>, <b>nf</b>, <b>nh</b>, <b>ps</b>, <b>so</b>, <b>sp</b>, <b>ti</b>, <b>tr</b>.

       You may also use many troff escape sequences (those sequences  beginning  with  \).   When  you  need  to
       include  the  backslash character as normal text, use \e.  Other sequences you may use, where x or xx are
       any characters and N is any digit, include: <b>\'</b>, <b>\`</b>, <b>\-</b>, <b>\.</b>, <b>\"</b>, <b>\%</b>, <b>\*x</b>, <b>\*(xx</b>, <b>\(xx</b>,  <b>\$N</b>,  <b>\nx</b>,  <b>\n(xx</b>,
       <b>\fx</b>, and <b>\f(xx</b>.  Avoid using the escape sequences for drawing graphics.

       Do not use the optional parameter for <b>bp</b> (break page).  Use only positive values for <b>sp</b> (vertical space).
       Don't  define  a  macro  (<b>de</b>)  with  the  same  name  as a macro in this or the mdoc macro package with a
       different meaning; it's likely that such redefinitions will  be  ignored.   Every  positive  indent  (<b>in</b>)
       should  be  paired  with  a  matching  negative indent (although you should be using the <b>RS</b> and <b>RE</b> macros
       instead).  The condition test (<b>if,ie</b>) should only have 't' or 'n' as the  condition.   Only  translations
       (<b>tr</b>)  that  can be ignored should be used.  Font changes (<b>ft</b> and the <b>\f</b> escape sequence) should only have
       the values 1, 2, 3, 4, R, I, B, P, or CW (the ft command may also have no parameters).

       If you use capabilities beyond these,  check  the  results  carefully  on  several  tools.   Once  you've
       confirmed that the additional capability is safe, let the maintainer of this document know about the safe
       command or sequence that should be added to this list.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/usr/share/groff/">/usr/share/groff/</a></u>[*/]<u>tmac/an.tmac</u>
       <u>/usr/man/whatis</u>

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       By  all  means  include  full  URLs  (or  URIs)  in  the  text itself; some tools such as <b><a href="../man1/man2html.1.html">man2html</a></b>(1) can
       automatically turn them into hypertext links.  You can also use the <b>UR</b> and <b>UE</b> macros to identify links to
       related information.  If you include URLs, use the full URL (e.g., <a href="http://www.kernel.org">http://www.kernel.org</a>) to ensure  that
       tools can automatically find the URLs.

       Tools  processing  these  files  should  open  the file and examine the first nonwhitespace character.  A
       period (.) or single quote (') at the beginning of a line indicates a troff-based file (such  as  man  or
       mdoc).   A  left  angle bracket (&lt;) indicates an SGML/XML-based file (such as HTML or Docbook).  Anything
       else suggests simple ASCII text (e.g., a "catman" result).

       Many man pages begin with <b>'\"</b> followed by a space and a list of characters, indicating how the page is to
       be preprocessed.  For portability's sake to non-troff translators  we  recommend  that  you  avoid  using
       anything  other than <b><a href="../man1/tbl.1.html">tbl</a></b>(1), and Linux can detect that automatically.  However, you might want to include
       this information so your man page can  be  handled  by  other  (less  capable)  systems.   Here  are  the
       definitions of the preprocessors invoked by these characters:

       <b>e</b>  <a href="../man1/eqn.1.html">eqn</a>(1)

       <b>g</b>  <a href="../man1/grap.1.html">grap</a>(1)

       <b>p</b>  <a href="../man1/pic.1.html">pic</a>(1)

       <b>r</b>  <a href="../man1/refer.1.html">refer</a>(1)

       <b>t</b>  <a href="../man1/tbl.1.html">tbl</a>(1)

       <b>v</b>  <a href="../man1/vgrind.1.html">vgrind</a>(1)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Most  of the macros describe formatting (e.g., font type and spacing) instead of marking semantic content
       (e.g., this text is a reference to another page), compared to formats like mdoc and  DocBook  (even  HTML
       has  more semantic markings).  This situation makes it harder to vary the <b>man</b> format for different media,
       to make the formatting consistent for a given media, and to automatically  insert  cross-references.   By
       sticking to the safe subset described above, it should be easier to automate transitioning to a different
       reference page format in the future.

       The Sun macro <b>TX</b> is not implemented.
