</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       yodltables - Yodl’s table support

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Tables  are  preferably  defined using the `tbl’ macro, although the `table’ macro remains available. The
       macros that are used in  combination  with  `tbl’  are  described  in  this  man-page  and  also  in  the
       <b><a href="../man7/yodlmacros.7.html">yodlmacros</a></b>(7)  man-page. The macros that are used in combination with the `table’ macros are described in
       the <b><a href="../man7/yodlmacros.7.html">yodlmacros</a></b>(7) man-page only.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       o      To start a table the `tbl’ macro is used. It is currently available for `html, man/ms, latex’  and
              `txt’ conversions. When specifying `tbl’ as an argument of the `center’ macro, the resulting table
              will  be centered on the page or html screen. In text mode centering is simulated by starting each
              row with eight blank space characters.

              Its first argument defines the alignment of the information in the table’s columns, and is used by
              all conversions except `txt’. Use `l’ for left-alignment, `c’ for centered-alignment and  `r’  for
              right-alignment.  Individual  cells  of  the  table  may override these default settings using the
              macros `tac’ and `tnac’.

              Its second argument defines the contents of  the  table  consisting  of  rows  (using  `tr’),  and
              horizontal  lines  (using `tline’), which may extend over the full table width or may cover one or
              more individual columns. With `txt’ conversion rough approximations of horizontal lines are used.

              When defining  tables  it  is  advised  to  clearly  layout  the  table  specification.  To  avoid
              inadvertently introducing new lines lines should end in a backslash (or comment).

              Example:

              tbl(lcr)(\// 3 columns, resp. left, center and right aligned
                  \// contents go here
              )\

              The macro `tbl’ recognizes `attrib’.

       o      Rows  of  a table are defined by the `tr’-macro. It expects one argument: the contents of the row,
              defining the row’s column elements.  Instead of rows defining column elements (partial) horizontal
              lines may be inserted. The `tline’ macro is used for that (see below).

              Example:

              tbl(lcr)(\
                  tr(\//              1st row
                      \// row elements go here
                  )\
                  tr(\//              2nd row
                      \// row elements go here
                  )\
              )\

              The macro `tr’ recognizes `attrib’.

       o      Column elements are defined by the `tc,  tn,  tac,’  and  `tnac’  macros.  Each  of  these  macros
              recognizes `attrib’.

       o      The  `tc’  macro  defines  the contents of column element: its order number in a row is aligned as
              specified by the corresponding letter in `tbl’s’ first argument. E.g.,

              tbl(lcr)(\
                  tr(\
                     tc(left aligned)\
                     tc(centered)\
                     tc(right aligned)\
                  )\
              )\

       o      The `tnc’ macro defines the contents of column element. It expects two arguments:  the  number  of
              columns  covered  by  this macro, and the contents of those elements. The contents are centered in
              the rows covered by the `tnc’ macro. E.g.,

              tbl(lcr)(\
                  tr(\
                     tc(left aligned)\
                     <a href="../man2/tnc.2.html">tnc</a>(2)(centered)\//    spans columns 2 and 3.
                  )\
              )\

       o      The `tac’ macro defines the contents of column element, defining  a  specific  alignment  for  its
              contents.  It  expects  two arguments: the alignment to be used for this element and the element’s
              contents.

              At most two alignment specification characters  are  used:  a  specification  for  the  horizontal
              alignment  (one  of  c,  l, r (centered, left-aligned, right-aligned)) and a specification for the
              vertical alignment (one of t, b (vertical top- and bottom-alignment)) (not  all  conversion  types
              may support all alignment types). Specifications other than c, l, r, b, and t are ignored. If only
              a vertical alignment type is specified, then usually the horizontal centered alignment is used. As
              a  rule  of  thumb always also specify a horizontal alignment type if a vertical alignment type is
              specified. The result of specifying conflicting alignment  types  (e.g.,  `lr’  or  `tb’)  is  not
              defined.

              Vertical  alignment  is  handled differently by different conversion types. E.g., when table cells
              span multiple lines then LaTeX uses the vertical alignment specification for that  cell  to  align
              the neighboring cells: with LaTeX conversions the following aligns `rows’ and `second’:

              tac(b)(two+nl()rows)
              tc(second)

              but  with  html-conversions  `second’  is  vertically center-aligned: in between `two’ and `rows’.
              Bottom line: provide each column element in a row that you want to be top- or bottom-aligned  with
              a `t’ or `b’ specification.

              When using man-conversions the situation is complex in that bottom alignment does not appear to be
              supported.  Moreover,  unless long lines are wrapped in `text blocks’ (see below at `twrap’) there
              won’t be any wrapping of long lines. The same holds true for LaTeX  conversions,  but  with  LaTeX
              columns  may be given fixed physical widths, resulting in automatically wrapping long lines. Also,
              bottom alignment appears not to be  supported  when  converting  to  man.  At  this  point  bottom
              alignment  when converting to man is realized by defining a separate table row containing the last
              contents of a long line. This may require some  iterations.  The  specification  could  then  look
              somewhat like this (again: for `twrap’ see below):

              tbl(lr)(\
                  tr(\
                      <a href="../man1/twrap.1.html">twrap</a>(1)\
                      tac(lb)(Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
                              consectetur adipiscing elit, sed
                              do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut
                              labore et dolore magna aliqua.)\
                      <a href="../man0/twrap.0.html">twrap</a>(0)\
                      tc()\//           empty cell
                  )\
                  tr(\//                simulated bottom alignment,
                      tac(l)(Ut enim ad minim veniam)\
                      tac(rb)(left)\
                  )\
              )\

              In  some  cases  (e.g.,  using  LaTeX  conversions  where  a  column width must be specified) more
              elaborate alignment specifications are required. For that the `tao’ (table alignment override) and
              `twrap’ macros are available (see below).

              E.g.,

              tbl(lcr)(\
                  tr(\
                     tc(left aligned)\
                     tac(l)(left aligned)\// left alignment instead
                                         \// of centered
                     tac(rb)(left+nl()aligned)\// right-bottom
                                         \// alignment
                  )\
              )\

       o      The `tnac’ macro defines the contents of column element, defining a  specific  alignment  for  its
              contents. It expects three arguments: the number of columns spanned by the contents of this macro,
              the alignment to be used and the element’s contents.

              The  alignment specifications and considerations are the same as with the `tac’ macro: see `tac’s’
              description for the details.

</pre><h4><b>HORIZONTAL</b> <b>LINES</b></h4><pre>
       Horizontal lines (partially) spanning the width of tables defined by the `tbl’ macro  are  defined  using
       the `tline’ macro. The `tline’ macro expects two arguments:

       o      If  both  arguments  are specified, then the first argument defines the column <u>number</u> (so, not the
              column <u>offset</u>!) where a horizontal line must start, and the second  argument  defines  the  column
              number  through  where  the  horizontal  line  should  continue.  If a series of `tline’ macros is
              specified then the first argument of the first `tline’ macro call must be at least 1;  the  second
              argument of the last `tline’ macro call must be at most equal to the table’s number of columns. In
              addition  the  second  arguments of `tline’ calls must at least be equal to their first arguments,
              and the first arguments of subsequent `tline’ calls must exceed the value of the  second  argument
              of  the  preceding  `tline’  macro  call.  A  series  of (at least one) `line’ calls in which both
              arguments are specified must be followed by a `tline’ call with two empty arguments. For example:

              tbl(ccccc)(\
                  tr(... row contents )\
                  <a href="../man1/tline.1.html">tline</a>(1)(1)\//    horizontal line at column 1
                  <a href="../man3/tline.3.html">tline</a>(3)(4)\//    horizontal line at columns 3 and 4
                  tline()()\//      now defined.
                  tr(... row contents )\
              )\

       o      Except for ending a series of `tline’ calls in which both arguments are specified, a `tline’  call
              not  specifying  its  second  argument sets a line over the full width of the table. In that case,
              when converting to txt a line of 60 minus (`-’) characters is written. If another number of  minus
              characters  is  required  then specify the required number as `tline’s’ first argument. When using
              other conversion types `tline’s’ first argument is ignored if its second argument is  empty.  Here
              is  the  previous  example again, this time setting a horizontal line before and after the table’s
              contents:

              tbl(ccccc)(\
                  tline()()\//      horizontal line spanning the full width
                  tr(... row contents )\
                  <a href="../man1/tline.1.html">tline</a>(1)(1)\//    horizontal line at column 1
                  <a href="../man3/tline.3.html">tline</a>(3)(4)\//    horizontal line at columns 3 and 4
                  tline()()\//      now defined.
                  tr(... row contents )\
                  tline()()\//      horizontal line spanning the full width
              )\

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b> <b>MACROS</b></h4><pre>
              Two support macros are available: `twrap’ for wrapping the contents of a cell in  a  `<u>text</u>  <u>block</u>’
              when  converting  to  man,  and `tao’ (table alignment override) for overriding a cell’s alignment
              specification for a specific conversion type.

              <b>The</b> <b>twrap</b> <b>macro</b>

              The `twrap’ macro is only interpreted when converting to man. It expects one numeric argument.  If
              zero  then the table’s cells are used as specified; if non-zero then the table’s cells are wrapped
              in groff/troff text blocks.

              If no text block is specified (i.e., `<a href="../man0/twrap.0.html">twrap</a>(0)’ (the default) is in effect) and a cell contains  a
              long line the long line will continue on one physical line, disproportionally widening that cell’s
              column; when using newlines are used in cell contents, and horizontal lines are used the resulting
              table may set the horizontal lines at unexpected rows.

              When requesting text blocks (i.e., `<a href="../man1/twrap.1.html">twrap</a>(1)’ was specified) long lines are automatically split up
              in  lines  of  reasonable widths, and they will be left-aligned in their columns. Those long lines
              may also contain explicit newline macros, forcing new lines at user-defined positions.

              Once a `twrap’ has been called, it remains in effect until the next `twrap’ call is encountered.

              <b>The</b> <b>tao</b> <b>macro</b>

              The `tao’ macro (table alignment override) is used to override the  alignment  specification  that
              would otherwise be used for the next table element. It is only active for the next `tc, tnc, tac,’
              or  `tnac’ call. It expect two arguments: its first argument defines the conversion type for which
              the override should be used, its second argument defines the alignment specification to use.

              Here are some examples:

              tbl(lr)(\
                  tr(\
                      tc(left aligned)\
                      tc(right aligned)\
                  )\
                  tr(\
                      tao(html)(c)\
                        tc(left aligned, except with html: then centered)\
                      tao(latex)(l)<a href="../manman/tao.man.html">tao</a>(man)(l)\
                        tac(c)(centered, but left aligned for latex and man)\
                  )\
              )

       o      Details when converting to html:
              The `t’ and `b’ specifications can be used to respectively top- and bottom-align cells in a  table
              row.  Usually  `tao’  doesn’t  have to be used, as the `tac’ macro already provides facilities for
              aligning cell contents. E.g., `tac(cb)(...)’ centers the contents, and aligns its bottom line with
              the remaining cells on its line.

       o      Details when converting to LaTeX:
              To request a top-aligned table element of a specified width (e.g.,  4  cm.)  the  following  `tao’
              specification can be used:

              tao(latex)(NOTRANS(t{p{4cm}}))

              Similarly,  for  a  center-aligned  element  use  `c{p{4cm}}’.  But  to align the bottom-line of a
              multi-line element with its neighboring cells use

              tao(latex)(NOTRANS(b{b{4cm}}))

              (combinations are also possible: if one cell uses top alignment,  and  another  bottom  alignment,
              then  the  top  line  of the former cell and the bottom line of the latter cell appear on the same
              physical line).

                     Alternatively, instead of using fixed widths explicit newlines can be used. In that case, a
                     specification like `tao(latex)(rb)’ will align its bottom line with the other cells in  its
                     row, while right-aligning its contents.

                     When  a  fixed  width  is  specified  for  a  cell,  then  other  cells  in  its column not
                     automatically also use that width. If other cells should also use a fixed width  they  must
                     explicitly specify their widths.
