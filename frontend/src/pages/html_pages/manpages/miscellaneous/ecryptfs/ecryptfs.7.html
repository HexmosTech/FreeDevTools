</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       eCryptfs - an enterprise-class cryptographic filesystem for linux

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mount</b> <b>-t</b> <b>ecryptfs</b> <b>[SRC</b> <b>DIR]</b> <b>[DST</b> <b>DIR]</b> <b>-o</b> <b>[OPTIONS]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       eCryptfs  is a POSIX-compliant enterprise-class stacked cryptographic filesystem for Linux. It is derived
       from Erez Zadok's Cryptfs, implemented through the FiST framework  for  generating  stacked  filesystems.
       eCryptfs  extends  Cryptfs  to  provide  advanced  key  management  and policy features.  eCryptfs stores
       cryptographic metadata in the header of each file written, so that encrypted files can be copied  between
       hosts;  the  file  will  be  decryptable  with  the proper key, and there is no need to keep track of any
       additional information aside from what is already in the encrypted file itself. Think of  eCryptfs  as  a
       sort of "gnupgfs."

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       KERNEL OPTIONS

            Parameters that apply to the eCryptfs kernel module.

       <b>ecryptfs_sig=(fekek_sig)</b>
              Specify  the signature of the mount wide authentication token. The authentication token must be in
              the kernel keyring before the mount is performed. ecryptfs-manager or the  eCryptfs  mount  helper
              can be used to construct the authentication token and add it to the keyring prior to mounting.

       <b>ecryptfs_fnek_sig=(fnek_sig)</b>
              Specify  the  signature  of  the  mount  wide  authentication  token used for filename crypto. The
              authentication must be in the kernel keyring before mounting.

       <b>ecryptfs_cipher=(cipher)</b>
              Specify the symmetric cipher to be used on a per file basis

       <b>ecryptfs_key_bytes=(key_bytes)</b>
              Specify the keysize to be used with the selected cipher. If the cipher only has  one  keysize  the
              keysize does not need to be specified.

       <b>ecryptfs_passthrough</b>
              Allows for non-eCryptfs files to be read and written from within an eCryptfs mount. This option is
              turned off by default.

       <b>no_sig_cache</b>
              Do  not  check  the mount key signature against the values in the user's <a href="file:~/.ecryptfs/sig-cache.txt">~/.ecryptfs/sig-cache.txt</a>
              file. This is useful for such things as non-interactive setup scripts, so that  the  mount  helper
              does not stop and prompt the user in the event that the key sig is not in the cache.

       <b>ecryptfs_encrypted_view</b>
              This  option  provides  a  unified  encrypted file format of the eCryptfs files in the lower mount
              point.  Currently, it is only useful if the lower mount point contains  files  with  the  metadata
              stored  in  the  extended  attribute.   Upon  a  file read in the upper mount point, the encrypted
              version of the file will be presented with the metadata in the file header instead of  the  xattr.
              Files cannot be opened for writing when this option is enabled.

       <b>ecryptfs_xattr</b>
              Store  the  metadata in the extended attribute of the lower files rather than the header region of
              the lower files.

       <b>verbose</b>
              Log ecryptfs information to /var/log/messages.  Do not run eCryptfs in verbose-mode unless you are
              doing so for the sole purpose of development, since secret values  will  be  written  out  to  the
              system log in that case.

       MOUNT HELPER OPTIONS

              Parameters that apply to the eCryptfs mount helper.

       <b>key=(keytype):[KEY</b> <b>MODULE</b> <b>OPTIONS]</b>
              Specify the type of key to be used when mounting eCryptfs.

       <b>ecryptfs_enable_filename_crypto=(y/n)</b>
              Specify  whether  filename  encryption should be enabled. If not, the mount helper will not prompt
              the user for the filename encryption key signature (default).

       <b>verbosity=0/1</b>
              If verbosity=1, the mount helper will  ask  you  for  missing  values  (default).   Otherwise,  if
              verbosity=0, it will not ask for missing values and will fail if required values are omitted.

       KEY MODULE OPTIONS

              Parameters that apply to individual key modules have the alias for the key module in the prefix of
              the  parameter  name.  Key modules are pluggable, and which key modules are available on any given
              system is dependent upon whatever happens to be installed in <a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a>*/ecryptfs/.

       <b>passphrase_passwd=(passphrase)</b>
              The actual password is passphrase. Since the password is visible to utilities (like ps under Unix)
              this form should only be used where security is not important.

       <b>passphrase_passwd_file=(filename)</b>
              The password should be specified in a file with passphrase_passwd_file=(passphrase). It is  highly
              recommended that the file be stored on a secure medium such as a personal usb key.

       <b>passphrase_passwd_fd=(file</b> <b>descriptor)</b>
              The password is specified through the specified file descriptor.

       <b>passphrase_salt=(hex</b> <b>value)</b>
              The salt should be specified as a 16 digit hex value.

       <b>openssl_keyfile=(filename)</b>
              The filename should be the filename of a file containing an RSA SSL key.

       <b>openssl_passwd_file=(filename)</b>
              The  password  should  be specified in a file with openssl_passwd=(openssl-password). It is highly
              recommended that the file be stored on a secure medium such as a personal usb key.

       <b>openssl_passwd_fd=(file</b> <b>descriptor)</b>
              The password is specified through the specified file descriptor.

       <b>openssl_passwd=(password)</b>
              The password can be specified on the command line. Since the password is visible  in  the  process
              list, it is highly recommended to use this option only for testing purposes.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The following command will layover mount eCryptfs on /secret with a passphrase contained in a file stored
       on secure media mounted at /mnt/usb/.

       <b>mount</b> <b>-t</b> <b>ecryptfs</b> <b>-o</b> <b>key=passphrase:passphrase_passwd_file=/mnt/usb/file.txt</b> <b>/secret</b> <b>/secret</b>

       Where file.txt contains the contents <b>"passphrase_passwd=[passphrase]"</b>.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Do  not  run  eCryptfs in verbose-mode unless you are doing so for the sole purpose of development, since
       secret values will be written out to the system log in that case. Make certain that your  eCryptfs  mount
       covers  all  locations  where  your  applications  may write sensitive data. In addition, use dm-crypt to
       encrypt your swap space with a random key on boot, or see <b><a href="../man1/ecryptfs-setup-swap.1.html">ecryptfs-setup-swap</a></b>(1).

       Passphrases have a maximum length of 64 characters.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Please    post    bug    reports    to     the     eCryptfs     bug     tracker     on     Launchpad.net:
       https://bugs.launchpad.net/ecryptfs/+filebug.

       For kernel bugs, please follow the procedure detailed in Documentation/oops-tracing.txt to help us figure
       out what is happening.
