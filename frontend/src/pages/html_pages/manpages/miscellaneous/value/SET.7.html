       SET - change a run-time parameter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       SET [ SESSION | LOCAL ] <u>configuration_parameter</u> { TO | = } { <u>value</u> | '<u>value</u>' | DEFAULT }
       SET [ SESSION | LOCAL ] TIME ZONE { <u>value</u> | '<u>value</u>' | LOCAL | DEFAULT }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>SET</b> command changes run-time configuration parameters. Many of the run-time parameters listed in
       Chapter 19 can be changed on-the-fly with <b>SET</b>. (Some parameters can only be changed by superusers and
       users who have been granted SET privilege on that parameter. There are also parameters that cannot be
       changed after server or session start.)  <b>SET</b> only affects the value used by the current session.

       If <b>SET</b> (or equivalently <b>SET</b> <b>SESSION</b>) is issued within a transaction that is later aborted, the effects of
       the <b>SET</b> command disappear when the transaction is rolled back. Once the surrounding transaction is
       committed, the effects will persist until the end of the session, unless overridden by another <b>SET</b>.

       The effects of <b>SET</b> <b>LOCAL</b> last only till the end of the current transaction, whether committed or not. A
       special case is <b>SET</b> followed by <b>SET</b> <b>LOCAL</b> within a single transaction: the <b>SET</b> <b>LOCAL</b> value will be seen
       until the end of the transaction, but afterwards (if the transaction is committed) the <b>SET</b> value will
       take effect.

       The effects of <b>SET</b> or <b>SET</b> <b>LOCAL</b> are also canceled by rolling back to a savepoint that is earlier than the
       command.

       If <b>SET</b> <b>LOCAL</b> is used within a function that has a SET option for the same variable (see CREATE FUNCTION
       (<b><a href="../man7/CREATE_FUNCTION.7.html">CREATE_FUNCTION</a></b>(7))), the effects of the <b>SET</b> <b>LOCAL</b> command disappear at function exit; that is, the
       value in effect when the function was called is restored anyway. This allows <b>SET</b> <b>LOCAL</b> to be used for
       dynamic or repeated changes of a parameter within a function, while still having the convenience of using
       the SET option to save and restore the caller's value. However, a regular <b>SET</b> command overrides any
       surrounding function's SET option; its effects will persist unless rolled back.

           <b>Note</b>

           In PostgreSQL versions 8.0 through 8.2, the effects of a <b>SET</b> <b>LOCAL</b> would be canceled by releasing an
           earlier savepoint, or by successful exit from a PL/pgSQL exception block. This behavior has been
           changed because it was deemed unintuitive.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       SESSION
           Specifies that the command takes effect for the current session. (This is the default if neither
           SESSION nor LOCAL appears.)

       LOCAL
           Specifies that the command takes effect for only the current transaction. After <b>COMMIT</b> or <b>ROLLBACK</b>,
           the session-level setting takes effect again. Issuing this outside of a transaction block emits a
           warning and otherwise has no effect.

       <u>configuration_parameter</u>
           Name of a settable run-time parameter. Available parameters are documented in Chapter 19 and below.

       <u>value</u>
           New value of parameter. Values can be specified as string constants, identifiers, numbers, or
           comma-separated lists of these, as appropriate for the particular parameter.  DEFAULT can be written
           to specify resetting the parameter to its default value (that is, whatever value it would have had if
           no <b>SET</b> had been executed in the current session).

       Besides the configuration parameters documented in Chapter 19, there are a few that can only be adjusted
       using the <b>SET</b> command or that have a special syntax:

       SCHEMA
           SET SCHEMA '<u>value</u>' is an alias for SET search_path TO <u>value</u>. Only one schema can be specified using
           this syntax.

       NAMES
           SET NAMES <u>value</u> is an alias for SET client_encoding TO <u>value</u>.

       SEED
           Sets the internal seed for the random number generator (the function <b>random</b>). Allowed values are
           floating-point numbers between -1 and 1 inclusive.

           The seed can also be set by invoking the function <b>setseed</b>:

               SELECT setseed(<u>value</u>);

       TIME ZONE
           SET TIME ZONE '<u>value</u>' is an alias for SET timezone TO '<u>value</u>'. The syntax SET TIME ZONE allows
           special syntax for the time zone specification. Here are examples of valid values:

           'America/Los_Angeles'
               The time zone for Berkeley, California.

           'Europe/Rome'
               The time zone for Italy.

           -7
               The time zone 7 hours west from UTC (equivalent to PDT). Positive values are east from UTC.

           INTERVAL '-08:00' HOUR TO MINUTE
               The time zone 8 hours west from UTC (equivalent to PST).

           LOCAL
           DEFAULT
               Set the time zone to your local time zone (that is, the server's default value of <u>timezone</u>).

           Timezone settings given as numbers or intervals are internally translated to POSIX timezone syntax.
           For example, after SET TIME ZONE -7, <b>SHOW</b> <b>TIME</b> <b>ZONE</b> would report &lt;-07&gt;+07.

           Time zone abbreviations are not supported by <b>SET</b>; see Section 8.5.3 for more information about time
           zones.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The function <b>set_config</b> provides equivalent functionality; see Section 9.28.1. Also, it is possible to
       UPDATE the pg_settings system view to perform the equivalent of <b>SET</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Set the schema search path:

           SET search_path TO my_schema, public;

       Set the style of date to traditional POSTGRES with “day before month” input convention:

           SET datestyle TO postgres, dmy;

       Set the time zone for Berkeley, California:

           SET TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles';

       Set the time zone for Italy:

           SET TIME ZONE 'Europe/Rome';

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       SET TIME ZONE extends syntax defined in the SQL standard. The standard allows only numeric time zone
       offsets while PostgreSQL allows more flexible time-zone specifications. All other SET features are
       PostgreSQL extensions.
