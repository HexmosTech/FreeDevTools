       amt-howto - Intel AMT with linux mini howto

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>AMT</b> <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>care?</b>
       AMT  stands for "Active Management Technology".  It provides some remote management facilities.  They are
       handled by the hardware and firmware, thus they work independant from the operation  system.   Means:  It
       works  before  Linux bootet up to the point where it activated the network interface.  It works even when
       your most recent test kernel deadlocked the  machine.   Which  makes  it  quite  useful  for  development
       machines ...

       Intel AMT is part of the vPro Platform.  Recent intel-chipset based business machines should have it.  My
       fairly new Intel SDV machine has it too.

   <b>Documentation</b>
       Look here for documentation beyond this mini howto:
       <a href="http://www.intel.com/technology/platform-technology/intel-amt/">http://www.intel.com/technology/platform-technology/intel-amt/</a>
       Most useful to get started: "Intel AMT Deployment and Reference Guide"

   <b>Very</b> <b>short</b> <b>AMT</b> <b>enabling</b> <b>instructions.</b>
       Enter BIOS Setup.
              * Enable AMT

       Enter ME (Management Extention) Setup.  Ctrl-P hotkey works for me.
              * Login, factory default password is "admin".
              *  Change  password.   Trivial ones don't work, must include upper- and lowercase letters, digits,
              special characters.
              * Enable AMT Managment.

       Reboot, Enter ME Setup again with AMT enabled.
              * Configure AMT (hostname, network config, ...)
              * Use SMB (Small Business) management mode.  The other one (Enterprise) requires Active  Directory
              Service Infrastructure, you don't want that, at least not for your first steps ...

   <b>Testing</b> <b>AMT</b>
       Take  your  browser,  point it to <a href="http://machine">http://machine</a>:16992/.  If you configured AMT to use DHCP (which is the
       default) the OS and the management stack share the same IP address.

       You must do that from a remote host as the NIC intercepts network packets for AMT, thus it  doesn't  work
       from  the  local  machine  as  the  packets  never pass the NIC then.  If everything is fine you'll see a
       greeting page with a button for login.

       You can login now, using "admin" as username and the password configured during setup.  You'll  see  some
       pages with informations about the machine.  You can also change AMT settings here.

   <b>Control</b> <b>Machine</b>
       You  might  have  noticed  already  while  browing  the pages: There is a "Remote Control" page.  You can
       remotely reset and powercycle the machine there, thus recover the machine after booting a b0rken  kernel,
       without having someone walk over to the machine and hit the reset button.

   <b>Serial-over-LAN</b> <b>(SOL)</b> <b>console</b>
       AMT  also  provides  a  virtual  serial  port which can be accessed via network.  That gives you a serial
       console without a serial cable to another machine.

       If you have activated AMT and SOL the linux kernel should see an additional serial port, like this on  my
       machine:

         [root@xeni ~]# dmesg | grep ttyS2
         0000:00:03.3: ttyS2 at I/O 0xe000 (irq = 169) is a 16550A

       Edit initab, add a line like this:

         T2:2345:respawn:<a href="file:/sbin/getty">/sbin/getty</a> ttyS2 115200 vt100-nav

       You  should  add  the serial port to /etc/securetty too so you are able to login as root.  Reload inittab
       ("init q").  Use amtterm to connect.  Tap enter.  You should see a login prompt now and be able to login.

       You can also use that device as console for the linux  kernel,  using  the  usual  "console=ttyS2,115200"
       kernel command line argument, so you see the boot messages (and kernel Oopses, if any).

       You  can  tell grub to use that serial device, so you can pick a working kernel for the next boot.  Usual
       commands from the grub manual, except that you need "--port=0xe000" instead of "--unit=0" due to the non-
       standard I/O port for the serial line (my machine, yours might use another port, check linux kernel  boot
       messages).

       The  magic command for the Xen kernel is "com1=115200,8n1,0xe000,0" (again, you might have to replace the
       I/O port).  The final '0' disables the IRQ, otherwise  the  Xen  kernel  hangs  at  boot  after  enabling
       interrupts.

   <b>Fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>Xen</b> <b>and</b> <b>AMT</b>
       The  AMT  network  stack  seems  to  become  slightly  confused  when running on a Xen host in DHCP mode.
       Everything works fine as long as only Dom0 runs.  But if one starts a guest OS (with bridged  networking)
       AMT suddenly changes the IP address to the one the guest aquired via DHCP.

       It is probably a good idea to assign a separate static IP address to AMT then.  I didn't manage to switch
       my machine from DHCP to static IP yet though, the BIOS refuses to accept the settings.  The error message
       doesn't indicate why.

   <b>More</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>AMT</b>
       You  might  want  to download the DTK (Developer Toolkit, source code is available too) and play with it.
       The .exe is a self-extracting rar archive and can be unpacked on linux  using  the  unrar  utility.   The
       Switchbox  comes  with  a linux binary (additionally to the Windows stuff).  The GUI tools are written in
       C#.  Trying to make them fly with mono didn't work for me though (mono  version  1.2.3  as  shipped  with
       Fedora 7).
