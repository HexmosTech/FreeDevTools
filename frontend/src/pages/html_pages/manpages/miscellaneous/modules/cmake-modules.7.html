       cmake-modules - CMake Modules Reference

       The  modules listed here are part of the CMake distribution.  Projects may provide further modules; their
       location(s) can be specified in the <u>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</u> variable.

</pre><h4><b>UTILITY</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       These modules are loaded using the <u>include()</u> command.

   <b>AndroidTestUtilities</b>
       Added in version 3.7.

       Create a test that automatically loads specified data onto an Android device.

   <b>Introduction</b>
       Use this module to push data needed for testing an Android  device  behavior  onto  a  connected  Android
       device.  The  module  will  accept files and libraries as well as separate destinations for each. It will
       create a test that loads the files into a device object  store  and  link  to  them  from  the  specified
       destination. The files are only uploaded if they are not already in the object store.

       For example:

          include(AndroidTestUtilities)
          android_add_test_data(
            example_setup_test
            FILES &lt;files&gt;...
            LIBS &lt;libs&gt;...
            DEVICE_TEST_DIR "/data/local/tests/example"
            DEVICE_OBJECT_STORE "/sdcard/.ExternalData/SHA"
            )

       At  build time a test named "example_setup_test" will be created.  Run this test on the command line with
       <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> to load the data onto the Android device.

   <b>Module</b> <b>Functions</b>
       <b>android_add_test_data</b>

                 android_add_test_data(&lt;test-name&gt;
                   [FILES &lt;files&gt;...] [FILES_DEST &lt;device-dir&gt;]
                   [LIBS &lt;libs&gt;...]   [LIBS_DEST &lt;device-dir&gt;]
                   [DEVICE_OBJECT_STORE &lt;device-dir&gt;]
                   [DEVICE_TEST_DIR &lt;device-dir&gt;]
                   [NO_LINK_REGEX &lt;strings&gt;...]
                   )

              The  <b>android_add_test_data</b>  function  is  used  to  copy  files  and  libraries  needed   to   run
              project-specific  tests.  On  the host operating system, this is done at build time. For on-device
              testing, the files are loaded onto the device by the manufactured test at run time.

              This function accepts the following named parameters:

              <b>FILES</b> <b>&lt;files&gt;...</b>
                     zero or more files needed for testing

              <b>LIBS</b> <b>&lt;libs&gt;...</b>
                     zero or more libraries needed for testing

              <b>FILES_DEST</b> <b>&lt;device-dir&gt;</b>
                     absolute path where the data files are expected to be

              <b>LIBS_DEST</b> <b>&lt;device-dir&gt;</b>
                     absolute path where the libraries are expected to be

              <b>DEVICE_OBJECT_STORE</b> <b>&lt;device-dir&gt;</b>
                     absolute path to the location where the data is stored on-device

              <b>DEVICE_TEST_DIR</b> <b>&lt;device-dir&gt;</b>
                     absolute path to the root directory of the on-device test location

              <b>NO_LINK_REGEX</b> <b>&lt;strings&gt;...</b>
                     list of regex strings matching the names of files that should be  copied  from  the  object
                     store to the testing directory

   <b>BundleUtilities</b>
       Functions to help assemble a standalone bundle application.

       A  collection  of CMake utility functions useful for dealing with <b>.app</b> bundles on the Mac and bundle-like
       directories on any OS.

       The following functions are provided by this module:

          fixup_bundle
          copy_and_fixup_bundle
          verify_app
          get_bundle_main_executable
          get_dotapp_dir
          get_bundle_and_executable
          get_bundle_all_executables
          get_item_key
          get_item_rpaths
          clear_bundle_keys
          set_bundle_key_values
          get_bundle_keys
          copy_resolved_item_into_bundle
          copy_resolved_framework_into_bundle
          fixup_bundle_item
          verify_bundle_prerequisites
          verify_bundle_symlinks

       Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because  it  uses  function,  break  and  <b>PARENT_SCOPE</b>.   Also  depends  on
       <b>GetPrerequisites.cmake</b>.

       DO  NOT  USE  THESE  FUNCTIONS  AT  CONFIGURE  TIME  (from <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>)!  Instead, invoke them from an
       <u>install(CODE)</u> or <u>install(SCRIPT)</u> rule.

          fixup_bundle(&lt;app&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;)

       Fix up <b>&lt;app&gt;</b> bundle in-place and make it standalone, such that it can be drag-n-drop  copied  to  another
       machine and run on that machine as long as all of the system libraries are compatible.

       If  you pass plugins to <b>fixup_bundle</b> as the libs parameter, you should install them or copy them into the
       bundle before calling <b>fixup_bundle</b>.  The <b>&lt;libs&gt;</b> parameter is a list of libraries that must be  fixed  up,
       but that cannot be determined by <b>otool</b> output analysis  (i.e. <b>plugins</b>).

       Gather  all the keys for all the executables and libraries in a bundle, and then, for each key, copy each
       prerequisite into the bundle.  Then fix each one up according to its own list of prerequisites.

       Then clear all the keys and call <b>verify_app</b> on the final bundle to ensure that it is truly standalone.

       Added in version 3.6: As an optional parameter (<b>IGNORE_ITEM</b>) a list of file names can  be  passed,  which
       are then ignored (e.g. <b>IGNORE_ITEM</b> <b>"vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe"</b>).

          copy_and_fixup_bundle(&lt;src&gt; &lt;dst&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;)

       Makes  a  copy  of the bundle <b>&lt;src&gt;</b> at location <b>&lt;dst&gt;</b> and then fixes up the new copied bundle in-place at
       <b>&lt;dst&gt;</b>.

          verify_app(&lt;app&gt;)

       Verifies that an application  <b>&lt;app&gt;</b>  appears  valid  based  on  running  analysis  tools  on  it.   Calls
       <u>message(FATAL_ERROR)</u> if the application is not verified.

       Added  in  version  3.6: As an optional parameter (<b>IGNORE_ITEM</b>) a list of file names can be passed, which
       are then ignored (e.g. <b>IGNORE_ITEM</b> <b>"vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe"</b>)

          get_bundle_main_executable(&lt;bundle&gt; &lt;result_var&gt;)

       The result will be the full path name of the bundle's main executable file or an <b>error:</b>  prefixed  string
       if it could not be determined.

          get_dotapp_dir(&lt;exe&gt; &lt;dotapp_dir_var&gt;)

       Returns  the nearest parent dir whose name ends with <b>.app</b> given the full path to an executable.  If there
       is no such parent dir, then simply return the dir containing the executable.

       The returned directory may or may not exist.

          get_bundle_and_executable(&lt;app&gt; &lt;bundle_var&gt; &lt;executable_var&gt; &lt;valid_var&gt;)

       Takes either a <b>.app</b> directory name or the name of an  executable  nested  inside  a  <b>.app</b>  directory  and
       returns  the  path  to  the  <b>.app</b>  directory  in  <b>&lt;bundle_var&gt;</b>  and  the  path  to its main executable in
       <b>&lt;executable_var&gt;</b>.

          get_bundle_all_executables(&lt;bundle&gt; &lt;exes_var&gt;)

       Scans <b>&lt;bundle&gt;</b> bundle recursively for all  <b>&lt;exes_var&gt;</b>  executable  files  and  accumulates  them  into  a
       variable.

          get_item_key(&lt;item&gt; &lt;key_var&gt;)

       Given  <b>&lt;item&gt;</b>  file  name,  generate <b>&lt;key_var&gt;</b> key that should be unique considering the set of libraries
       that need copying or fixing up to make a bundle standalone.  This is essentially the file name  including
       extension with <b>.</b> replaced by <b>_</b>

       This key is used as a prefix for CMake variables so that we can associate a set of variables with a given
       item based on its key.

          clear_bundle_keys(&lt;keys_var&gt;)

       Loop  over  the  <b>&lt;keys_var&gt;</b> list of keys, clearing all the variables associated with each key.  After the
       loop, clear the list of keys itself.

       Caller of <b>get_bundle_keys</b> should call <b>clear_bundle_keys</b> when done with list of keys.

          set_bundle_key_values(&lt;keys_var&gt; &lt;context&gt; &lt;item&gt; &lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;
                                &lt;copyflag&gt; [&lt;rpaths&gt;])

       Add <b>&lt;keys_var&gt;</b> key to the list (if necessary) for the given item.  If added, also set all  the  variables
       associated with that key.

          get_bundle_keys(&lt;app&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt; &lt;keys_var&gt;)

       Loop  over  all  the  executable  and  library  files within <b>&lt;app&gt;</b> bundle (and given as extra <b>&lt;libs&gt;</b>) and
       accumulate a list of keys representing them.  Set values associated with each key such that we  can  loop
       over  all  of  them  and copy prerequisite libs into the bundle and then do appropriate <b>install_name_tool</b>
       fixups.

       Added in version 3.6: As an optional parameter (<b>IGNORE_ITEM</b>) a list of file names can  be  passed,  which
       are then ignored (e.g. <b>IGNORE_ITEM</b> <b>"vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe"</b>)

          copy_resolved_item_into_bundle(&lt;resolved_item&gt; &lt;resolved_embedded_item&gt;)

       Copy a resolved item into the bundle if necessary.  Copy is not necessary, if the <b>&lt;resolved_item&gt;</b> is "the
       same as" the <b>&lt;resolved_embedded_item&gt;</b>.

          copy_resolved_framework_into_bundle(&lt;resolved_item&gt; &lt;resolved_embedded_item&gt;)

       Copy a resolved framework into the bundle if necessary.  Copy is not necessary, if the <b>&lt;resolved_item&gt;</b> is
       "the same as" the <b>&lt;resolved_embedded_item&gt;</b>.

       By  default,  <b>BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS</b>  is  not set.  If you want full frameworks embedded in your
       bundles,  set  <b>BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS</b>  to  <b>ON</b>  before   calling   fixup_bundle.    By   default,
       <b>COPY_RESOLVED_FRAMEWORK_INTO_BUNDLE</b>  copies  the  framework  dylib  itself  plus  the framework <b>Resources</b>
       directory.

          fixup_bundle_item(&lt;resolved_embedded_item&gt; &lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;)

       Get the direct/non-system prerequisites of the <b>&lt;resolved_embedded_item&gt;</b>.  For each  prerequisite,  change
       the  way it is referenced to the value of the <b>_EMBEDDED_ITEM</b> keyed variable for that prerequisite.  (Most
       likely changing to an <b>@executable_path</b> style reference.)

       This function requires that the <b>&lt;resolved_embedded_item&gt;</b> be <b>inside</b> the bundle already.  In  other  words,
       if  you pass plugins to <b>fixup_bundle</b> as the libs parameter, you should install them or copy them into the
       bundle before calling <b>fixup_bundle</b>.  The <b>libs</b> parameter is a list of libraries that must be fixed up, but
       that cannot be determined by otool output analysis.  (i.e., <b>plugins</b>)

       Also, change the id of the item being fixed up to its own <b>_EMBEDDED_ITEM</b> value.

       Accumulate changes in a local variable and make <u>one</u> call to <b>install_name_tool</b> at the end of the  function
       with all the changes at once.

       If  the  <b>BU_CHMOD_BUNDLE_ITEMS</b>  variable  is  set  then  bundle  items  will  be  marked  writable before
       <b>install_name_tool</b> tries to change them.

          verify_bundle_prerequisites(&lt;bundle&gt; &lt;result_var&gt; &lt;info_var&gt;)

       Verifies that the sum of all prerequisites of all files inside the bundle are contained within the bundle
       or are <b>system</b> libraries, presumed to exist everywhere.

       Added in version 3.6: As an optional parameter (<b>IGNORE_ITEM</b>) a list of file names can  be  passed,  which
       are then ignored (e.g. <b>IGNORE_ITEM</b> <b>"vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe"</b>)

          verify_bundle_symlinks(&lt;bundle&gt; &lt;result_var&gt; &lt;info_var&gt;)

       Verifies that any symlinks found in the <b>&lt;bundle&gt;</b> bundle point to other files that are already also in the
       bundle...  Anything that points to an external file causes this function to fail the verification.

   <b>CheckCCompilerFlag</b>
       Check once whether the C compiler supports a given flag.

       <b>check_c_compiler_flag</b>

                 check_c_compiler_flag(&lt;flag&gt; &lt;resultVar&gt;)

       Check once that the <b>&lt;flag&gt;</b> is accepted by the compiler without a diagnostic.  The result is stored in the
       internal  cache  variable  specified  by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b>, with boolean <b>true</b> for success and boolean <b>false</b> for
       failure.

       <b>true</b> indicates only that the compiler did not issue a diagnostic message when given the flag. Whether the
       flag has any effect is beyond the scope of this module.

       Internally, <u>try_compile()</u> is used to perform  the  check.  If  <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u>  is  set  to
       <b>EXECUTABLE</b>  (default),  the check compiles and links an executable program. If set to <b>STATIC_LIBRARY</b>, the
       check is compiled but not linked.

       See also <u>check_compiler_flag()</u> for a more general command syntax.

       The compile and link commands can be influenced by setting  any  of  the  following  variables  prior  to
       calling <b>check_c_compiler_flag()</b>. Unknown flags in these variables can case a false negative result.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String  of  additional  flags  to  pass  to the compiler. The string must be space-delimited--a
                 <u>;-list</u>  will   not   work.    The   contents   of   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u>   and   its   associated
                 configuration-specific  variable  are  automatically  added  to the compiler command before the
                 contents of <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of compiler definitions of the form <b>-DFOO</b> or <b>-DFOO=bar</b>.  A  definition  for  the  name
                 specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b> will also be added automatically.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of header search paths to pass to the compiler. These will be the only header search
                 paths used--the contents of the <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> directory property will be ignored.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS</b>
                 Added in version 3.14.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of options to add to the link command (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of libraries to add to the link command. These can be the name of system libraries  or
                 they can be <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
                 Added in version 3.31.

                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of  libraries  search  paths  to  pass  to the linker (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further
                 details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status  messages  associated  with  the
                 check will be suppressed.

   <b>CheckCompilerFlag</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       Check once whether the <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> compiler supports a given flag.

       <b>check_compiler_flag</b>

                 check_compiler_flag(&lt;lang&gt; &lt;flag&gt; &lt;resultVar&gt;)

       Check  once that the <b>&lt;flag&gt;</b> is accepted by the <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> compiler without a diagnostic. The result is stored
       in the internal cache variable specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b>, with boolean <b>true</b> for success and boolean  <b>false</b>
       for failure.

       <b>true</b> indicates only that the compiler did not issue a diagnostic message when given the flag. Whether the
       flag has any effect is beyond the scope of this module.

       Internally,  <u>try_compile()</u>  is  used  to  perform  the  check. If <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u> is set to
       <b>EXECUTABLE</b> (default), the check compiles and links an executable program. If set to  <b>STATIC_LIBRARY</b>,  the
       check is compiled but not linked.

       The  compile  and  link  commands  can  be  influenced by setting any of the following variables prior to
       calling <b>check_compiler_flag()</b>. Unknown flags in these variables can case a false negative result.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String of additional flags to pass to the  compiler.  The  string  must  be  space-delimited--a
                 <u>;-list</u>   will   not   work.    The   contents   of   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u>   and   its  associated
                 configuration-specific variable are automatically added to  the  compiler  command  before  the
                 contents of <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of  compiler  definitions  of the form <b>-DFOO</b> or <b>-DFOO=bar</b>. A definition for the name
                 specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b> will also be added automatically.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of header search paths to pass to the compiler. These will be the only  header  search
                 paths used--the contents of the <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> directory property will be ignored.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS</b>
                 Added in version 3.14.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of options to add to the link command (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u> of libraries to add to the link command. These can be the name of system libraries or
                 they can be <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
                 Added in version 3.31.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of libraries search paths to  pass  to  the  linker  (see  <u>try_compile()</u>  for  further
                 details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If  this  variable  evaluates  to a boolean true value, all status messages associated with the
                 check will be suppressed.

   <b>CheckCSourceCompiles</b>
       Check once if C source code can be built.

       <b>check_c_source_compiles</b>

                 check_c_source_compiles(&lt;code&gt; &lt;resultVar&gt;
                                         [FAIL_REGEX &lt;regex1&gt; [&lt;regex2&gt;...]])

              Check once that the source supplied in <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> can be built. The result is stored in  the  internal
              cache  variable  specified  by  <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b>,  with  boolean <b>true</b> for success and boolean <b>false</b> for
              failure.

              If <b>FAIL_REGEX</b> is provided, then failure is determined by checking  if  anything  in  the  compiler

              Internally,  <u>try_compile()</u>  is used to compile the source. If <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u> is set
              to <b>EXECUTABLE</b> (default), the source is compiled and linked as an executable  program.  If  set  to
              <b>STATIC_LIBRARY</b>, the source is compiled but not linked. In any case, all functions must be declared
              as usual.

              See also <u>check_source_compiles()</u> for a more general command syntax.

              See also <u>check_source_runs()</u> to run compiled source.

       <b>true</b> indicates only that the compiler did not issue a diagnostic message when given the flag. Whether the
       flag has any effect is beyond the scope of this module.

       Internally,  <u>try_compile()</u>  is  used  to  perform  the  check. If <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u> is set to
       <b>EXECUTABLE</b> (default), the check compiles and links an executable program. If set to  <b>STATIC_LIBRARY</b>,  the
       check is compiled but not linked.

              If <b>FAIL_REGEX</b> is provided, then failure is determined by checking  if  anything  in  the  compiler

                 check will be suppressed.

   <b>CheckCXXSymbolExists</b>
       Check if a symbol exists as a function, variable, or macro in <b>C++</b>.

       <b>check_cxx_symbol_exists</b>

                 check_cxx_symbol_exists(&lt;symbol&gt; &lt;files&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)

              Check that the <b>&lt;symbol&gt;</b> is available after including given header <b>&lt;files&gt;</b> and store the result  in
              a  <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.   Specify  the  list  of  files  in  one  argument  as  a semicolon-separated list.
              <b>check_cxx_symbol_exists()</b> can be used to check for symbols as seen by the C++ compiler, as opposed
              to <u>check_symbol_exists()</u>, which always uses the <b>C</b> compiler.

              If the header files define the symbol as a macro it is considered available and assumed  to  work.
              If  the  header  files  declare  the symbol as a function or variable then the symbol must also be
              available for linking.  If the symbol is a type, enum value,  or  C++  template  it  will  not  be
              recognized: consider using the <u>CheckTypeSize</u> or <u>CheckSourceCompiles</u> module instead.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This  command  is  unreliable when <b>&lt;symbol&gt;</b> is (potentially) an overloaded function. Since there is no
          reliable way to predict whether a given function in the  system  environment  may  be  defined  as  an
          overloaded function or may be an overloaded function on other systems or will become so in the future,
          it is generally advised to use the <u>CheckSourceCompiles</u> module for checking any function symbol (unless
          somehow  you  surely know the checked function is not overloaded on other systems or will not be so in
          the future).

       The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify the way the check is run:

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String of additional flags to pass to the  compiler.  The  string  must  be  space-delimited--a
                 <u>;-list</u>   will   not   work.    The   contents   of   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u>   and   its  associated
                 configuration-specific variable are automatically added to  the  compiler  command  before  the
                 contents of <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of  compiler  definitions  of the form <b>-DFOO</b> or <b>-DFOO=bar</b>. A definition for the name

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of header search paths to pass to the compiler. These will be the only  header  search

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If  this  variable  evaluates  to a boolean true value, all status messages associated with the
                 check will be suppressed.

       For example:

          # Check for macro SEEK_SET
          check_cxx_symbol_exists(SEEK_SET "cstdio" HAVE_SEEK_SET)
          # Check for function std::fopen
          check_cxx_symbol_exists(std::fopen "cstdio" HAVE_STD_FOPEN)

   <b>CheckFortranCompilerFlag</b>
       Added in version 3.3.

       Check once whether the Fortran compiler supports a given flag.

       <b>check_fortran_compiler_flag</b>

                 check_fortran_compiler_flag(&lt;flag&gt; &lt;resultVar&gt;)

       Check once that the <b>&lt;flag&gt;</b> is accepted by the compiler without a diagnostic.  The result is stored in the
       internal cache variable specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b>, with boolean <b>true</b> for success  and  boolean  <b>false</b>  for
       failure.

       flag has any effect is beyond the scope of this module.

       Internally,  <u>try_compile()</u>  is  used  to  perform  the  check. If <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u> is set to
       <b>EXECUTABLE</b> (default), the check compiles and links an executable program. If set to  <b>STATIC_LIBRARY</b>,  the
       check is compiled but not linked.

       See also <u>check_compiler_flag()</u> for a more general command syntax.

       The  compile  and  link  commands  can  be  influenced by setting any of the following variables prior to
       calling <b>check_fortran_compiler_flag()</b>. Unknown flags in these variables can case a false negative result.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String of additional flags to pass to the  compiler.  The  string  must  be  space-delimited--a
                 <u>;-list</u>   will   not   work.    The   contents   of   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u>   and   its  associated
                 configuration-specific variable are automatically added to  the  compiler  command  before  the
                 contents of <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of  compiler  definitions  of the form <b>-DFOO</b> or <b>-DFOO=bar</b>. A definition for the name
                 specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b> will also be added automatically.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of header search paths to pass to the compiler. These will be the only  header  search
                 paths used--the contents of the <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> directory property will be ignored.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS</b>
                 Added in version 3.14.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of options to add to the link command (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u> of libraries to add to the link command. These can be the name of system libraries or
                 they can be <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
                 Added in version 3.31.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of libraries search paths to  pass  to  the  linker  (see  <u>try_compile()</u>  for  further
                 details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If  this  variable  evaluates  to a boolean true value, all status messages associated with the
                 check will be suppressed.

   <b>CheckFortranFunctionExists</b>
       Check if a Fortran function exists.

       <b>CHECK_FORTRAN_FUNCTION_EXISTS</b>

                 CHECK_FORTRAN_FUNCTION_EXISTS(&lt;function&gt; &lt;result&gt;)

              where

              <b>&lt;function&gt;</b>
                     the name of the Fortran function

              <b>&lt;result&gt;</b>
                     variable to store the result; will be created as an internal cache variable.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This command does not detect functions in Fortran  modules.  In  general  it  is  recommended  to  use
          <u>CheckSourceCompiles</u> instead to determine if a Fortran function or subroutine is available.

       The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify the way the check is run:

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS</b>
                 Added in version 3.14.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of options to add to the link command (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u> of libraries to add to the link command. These can be the name of system libraries or
                 they can be <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
                 Added in version 3.31.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of libraries search paths to  pass  to  the  linker  (see  <u>try_compile()</u>  for  further
                 details).

   <b>CheckFortranSourceCompiles</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       Check once if Fortran source code can be built.

       <b>check_fortran_source_compiles</b>

                 check_fortran_source_compiles(&lt;code&gt; &lt;resultVar&gt;
                     [FAIL_REGEX &lt;regex&gt;...]
                     [SRC_EXT &lt;extension&gt;]
                 )

              Check  once  that the source supplied in <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> can be built. The result is stored in the internal
              cache variable specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b>, with boolean <b>true</b>  for  success  and  boolean  <b>false</b>  for
              failure.

              If  <b>FAIL_REGEX</b>  is  provided,  then  failure is determined by checking if anything in the compiler
              output matches any of the specified regular expressions.

              By default, the test source file will be given a <b>.F</b> file extension. The <b>SRC_EXT</b> option can be used
              to override this with <b>.&lt;extension&gt;</b> instead-- <b>.F90</b> is a typical choice.

              See also <u>check_source_compiles()</u> for a more general command syntax.

              See also <u>check_source_runs()</u> to run compiled source.

              Internally, <u>try_compile()</u> is used to compile the source. If <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u>  is  set
              to  <b>EXECUTABLE</b>  (default),  the  source is compiled and linked as an executable program. If set to
              <b>STATIC_LIBRARY</b>, the source is compiled but not linked. In any case, all functions must be declared
              as usual.

              The compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following variables prior to
              calling <b>check_fortran_source_compiles()</b>:

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String of additional flags to pass to the  compiler.  The  string  must  be  space-delimited--a

                 configuration-specific variable are automatically added to  the  compiler  command  before  the
                 contents of <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of  compiler  definitions  of the form <b>-DFOO</b> or <b>-DFOO=bar</b>. A definition for the name
                 specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b> will also be added automatically.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of header search paths to pass to the compiler. These will be the only  header  search
                 paths used--the contents of the <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> directory property will be ignored.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS</b>
                 Added in version 3.14.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of options to add to the link command (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u> of libraries to add to the link command. These can be the name of system libraries or

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
                 Added in version 3.31.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of libraries search paths to  pass  to  the  linker  (see  <u>try_compile()</u>  for  further
                 details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If  this  variable  evaluates  to a boolean true value, all status messages associated with the
                 check will be suppressed.

   <b>CheckFortranSourceRuns</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       Check once if given Fortran source compiles and links into an executable and can subsequently be run.

       <b>check_fortran_source_runs</b>

                 check_fortran_source_runs(&lt;code&gt; &lt;resultVar&gt;
                     [SRC_EXT &lt;extension&gt;])

              Check once that the source supplied in <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> can be built, linked as an executable, and then run.
              The <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> must contain a Fortran <b>program</b>.

              The result is stored in the internal cache variable specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b>. Success of build and
              run is indicated by boolean <b>true</b>.  Failure to build or run is indicated by boolean <b>false</b>  such  as
              an empty string or an error message.

                 check_fortran_source_runs("program test
                 real :: x[*]

                 end program"
                 HAVE_COARRAY)

              By  default,  the  test source file will be given a <b>.F90</b> file extension. The <b>SRC_EXT</b> option can be
              used to override this with <b>.&lt;extension&gt;</b> instead.

              See also <u>check_source_runs()</u> for a more general command syntax.

              Checks that the <b>&lt;function&gt;</b> is provided by libraries on the system and store the result in internal
              cache variable <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.

       The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify the way the check is run:

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String of additional flags to pass to the  compiler.  The  string  must  be  space-delimited--a

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Prefer using <u>CheckSymbolExists</u> or <u>CheckSourceCompiles</u>  instead  of  this  module,  for  the  following
          reasons:

          • <b>check_function_exists()</b> can't detect functions that are inlined in headers or specified as a macro.

          • <b>check_function_exists()</b>  can't detect anything in the 32-bit versions of the Win32 API, because of a
            mismatch in calling conventions.

          • <b>check_function_exists()</b> only verifies linking, it does not verify that the function is  declared  in
            system headers.

   <b>CheckIncludeFileCXX</b>
       Provides a macro to check if a header file can be included in <b>CXX</b>.

              flags to the check (or use <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b> below).

       The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify the way the check is run:

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String of additional flags to pass to the  compiler.  The  string  must  be  space-delimited--a

                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status  messages  associated  with  the
                 check will be suppressed.

       See  the  <u>CheckIncludeFiles</u>  module  to  check for multiple headers at once.  See the <u>CheckIncludeFileCXX</u>
       module to check for headers using the <b>CXX</b> language.

   <b>CheckIncludeFiles</b>
       Provides a macro to check if a list of one or more header files can be included together.

       <b>CHECK_INCLUDE_FILES</b>

                 CHECK_INCLUDE_FILES("&lt;includes&gt;" &lt;variable&gt; [LANGUAGE &lt;language&gt;])

              Check if the given <b>&lt;includes&gt;</b> list may be included together in a source file and store the  result
              in  an  internal  cache  entry  named  <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.  Specify the <b>&lt;includes&gt;</b> argument as a <u>;-list</u> of
              header file names.

              If <b>LANGUAGE</b> is set, the specified compiler will be used to perform the  check.  Acceptable  values
              are  <b>C</b>  and  <b>CXX</b>.  If  not  set,  the C compiler will be used if enabled. If the C compiler is not
              enabled, the C++ compiler will be used if enabled.

       The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify the way the check is run:

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String of additional flags to pass to the  compiler.  The  string  must  be  space-delimited--a
                 <u>;-list</u>   will   not   work.    The   contents   of   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u>   and   its  associated
                 configuration-specific variable are automatically added to  the  compiler  command  before  the
                 contents of <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of  compiler  definitions  of the form <b>-DFOO</b> or <b>-DFOO=bar</b>. A definition for the name
                 specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b> will also be added automatically.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of header search paths to pass to the compiler. These will be the only  header  search
                 paths used--the contents of the <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> directory property will be ignored.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS</b>
                 Added in version 3.14.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of options to add to the link command (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u> of libraries to add to the link command. These can be the name of system libraries or
                 they can be <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
                 Added in version 3.31.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of libraries search paths to  pass  to  the  linker  (see  <u>try_compile()</u>  for  further
                 details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If  this  variable  evaluates  to a boolean true value, all status messages associated with the
                 check will be suppressed.

       See modules <u>CheckIncludeFile</u> and <u>CheckIncludeFileCXX</u> to check for a  single  header  file  in  <b>C</b>  or  <b>CXX</b>
       languages.

   <b>CheckIPOSupported</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       Check  whether the compiler supports an interprocedural optimization (IPO/LTO).  Use this before enabling
       the <u>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION</u> target property.

       <b>check_ipo_supported</b>

                 check_ipo_supported([RESULT &lt;result&gt;] [OUTPUT &lt;output&gt;]
                                     [LANGUAGES &lt;lang&gt;...])

              Options are:

              <b>RESULT</b> <b>&lt;result&gt;</b>
                     Set <b>&lt;result&gt;</b> variable to <b>YES</b> if IPO is supported by the compiler and <b>NO</b> otherwise.  If this
                     option is not given then the command will issue a fatal error if IPO is not supported.

              <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>&lt;output&gt;</b>
                     Set <b>&lt;output&gt;</b> variable with details about any error.

              <b>LANGUAGES</b> <b>&lt;lang&gt;...</b>
                     Specify languages whose compilers to check.  Languages <b>C</b>, <b>CXX</b>, and <b>Fortran</b> are supported.

       It makes no sense to use this module when <u>CMP0069</u> is set to <b>OLD</b> so module will return error in this case.
       See policy <u>CMP0069</u> for details.

       Added in version 3.13: Add support for Visual Studio generators.

       Added in version 3.24: The check uses the  caller's  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u>  and  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</u>
       values.  See policy <u>CMP0138</u>.

   <b>Examples</b>
          check_ipo_supported() # fatal error if IPO is not supported
          set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE)

          # Optional IPO. Do not use IPO if it's not supported by compiler.
          check_ipo_supported(RESULT result OUTPUT output)
          if(result)
            set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE)
          else()
            message(WARNING "IPO is not supported: ${output}")
          endif()

   <b>CheckLanguage</b>
       Check whether a language can be enabled by the <u>enable_language()</u> or <u>project()</u> commands:

       <b>check_language</b>

                 check_language(&lt;lang&gt;)

              Try enabling language <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> in a test project and record results in the cache:

              <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER</u>
                     If  the  language  can be enabled, this variable is set to the compiler that was found.  If
                     the language cannot be enabled, this variable is set to <b>NOTFOUND</b>.

                     If this variable is already set, either explicitly or cached by a previous call, the  check
                     is skipped.

              <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER</u>
                     This variable is set when <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> is <b>CUDA</b> or <b>HIP</b>.

                     If  the  check  detects  an  explicit  host compiler that is required for compilation, this
                     variable will be set to that compiler.  If the check detects that no explicit host compiler
                     is needed, this variable will be cleared.

                     If this variable is already set, its value is preserved only  if  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER</u>  is
                     also  set.   Otherwise, the check runs and overwrites <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER</u> with a new
                     result.  Note that <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_HOST_COMPILER</u> documents it should not be set  without  also
                     setting <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER</u> to a NVCC compiler.

              <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_PLATFORM</u>
                     This variable is set to the detected GPU platform when <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> is <b>HIP</b>.

                     If  the  variable is already set its value is always preserved. Only compatible values will
                     be considered for <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER</u>.

       For example:

          check_language(Fortran)
          if(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER)
            enable_language(Fortran)
          else()
            message(STATUS "No Fortran support")
          endif()

   <b>CheckLibraryExists</b>
       Check once if the function exists in system or specified library.

       <b>CHECK_LIBRARY_EXISTS</b>

                 CHECK_LIBRARY_EXISTS(LIBRARY FUNCTION LOCATION VARIABLE)

                 LIBRARY  - the name of the library you are looking for
                 FUNCTION - the name of the function
                 LOCATION - location where the library should be found
                 VARIABLE - internal cache variable to store the result

       Prefer using <u>CheckSymbolExists</u> or <u>CheckSourceCompiles</u> instead of this module for more robust detection if
       a function is available in a library.

       The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify the way the check is run:

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String of additional flags to pass to the  compiler.  The  string  must  be  space-delimited--a
                 <u>;-list</u>   will   not   work.    The   contents   of   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u>   and   its  associated
                 configuration-specific variable are automatically added to  the  compiler  command  before  the
                 contents of <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of  compiler  definitions  of the form <b>-DFOO</b> or <b>-DFOO=bar</b>. A definition for the name
                 specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b> will also be added automatically.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS</b>
                 Added in version 3.14.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of options to add to the link command (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of libraries to add to the link command. These can be the name of system libraries  or
                 they can be <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
                 Added in version 3.31.

                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of  libraries  search  paths  to  pass  to the linker (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further
                 details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status  messages  associated  with  the
                 check will be suppressed.

   <b>CheckLinkerFlag</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       Check whether the compiler supports a given link flag.

       <b>check_linker_flag</b>

                 check_linker_flag(&lt;lang&gt; &lt;flag&gt; &lt;var&gt;)

       Check that the link <b>&lt;flag&gt;</b> is accepted by the <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> compiler without a diagnostic.  Stores the result in
       an internal cache entry named <b>&lt;var&gt;</b>.

       This    command    temporarily    sets   the   <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS</b>   variable   and   calls   the
       <u>check_source_compiles()</u> command from the <u>CheckSourceCompiles</u> module.  See that module's documentation for
       a listing of variables that can otherwise modify the build.

       The underlying implementation relies on the <u>LINK_OPTIONS</u>  property  to  check  the  specified  flag.  The
       <b>LINKER:</b> prefix, as described in the <u>target_link_options()</u> command, can be used as well.

       A  positive  result  from  this check indicates only that the compiler did not issue a diagnostic message
       when given the link flag.  Whether the flag has any effect or even a specific one is beyond the scope  of
       this module.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Since  the  <u>try_compile()</u> command forwards flags from variables like <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u>, unknown flags
          in such variables may cause a false negative for this check.

   <b>CheckOBJCCompilerFlag</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Check once whether the Objective-C compiler supports a given flag.

       <b>check_objc_compiler_flag</b>

                 check_objc_compiler_flag(&lt;flag&gt; &lt;resultVar&gt;)

       Check once that the <b>&lt;flag&gt;</b> is accepted by the compiler without a diagnostic.  The result is stored in the
       internal cache variable specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b>, with boolean <b>true</b> for success  and  boolean  <b>false</b>  for
       failure.

       <b>true</b> indicates only that the compiler did not issue a diagnostic message when given the flag. Whether the
       flag has any effect is beyond the scope of this module.

       Internally,  <u>try_compile()</u>  is  used  to  perform  the  check. If <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u> is set to
       <b>EXECUTABLE</b> (default), the check compiles and links an executable program. If set to  <b>STATIC_LIBRARY</b>,  the
       check is compiled but not linked.

       See also <u>check_compiler_flag()</u> for a more general command syntax.

       The  compile  and  link  commands  can  be  influenced by setting any of the following variables prior to
       calling <b>check_objc_compiler_flag()</b>. Unknown flags in these variables can case a false negative result.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String of additional flags to pass to the  compiler.  The  string  must  be  space-delimited--a
                 <u>;-list</u>   will   not   work.    The   contents   of   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u>   and   its  associated
                 configuration-specific variable are automatically added to  the  compiler  command  before  the
                 contents of <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of  compiler  definitions  of the form <b>-DFOO</b> or <b>-DFOO=bar</b>. A definition for the name
                 specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b> will also be added automatically.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of header search paths to pass to the compiler. These will be the only  header  search
                 paths used--the contents of the <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> directory property will be ignored.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS</b>
                 Added in version 3.14.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of options to add to the link command (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u> of libraries to add to the link command. These can be the name of system libraries or
                 they can be <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
                 Added in version 3.31.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of libraries search paths to  pass  to  the  linker  (see  <u>try_compile()</u>  for  further
                 details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If  this  variable  evaluates  to a boolean true value, all status messages associated with the
                 check will be suppressed.

   <b>CheckOBJCSourceCompiles</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Check once if Objective-C source can be built.

       <b>check_objc_source_compiles</b>

                 check_objc_source_compiles(&lt;code&gt; &lt;resultVar&gt;
                                            [FAIL_REGEX &lt;regex1&gt; [&lt;regex2&gt;...]])

              Check once that the source supplied in <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> can be built. The result is stored in  the  internal
              cache  variable  specified  by  <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b>,  with  boolean <b>true</b> for success and boolean <b>false</b> for
              failure.

              If <b>FAIL_REGEX</b> is provided, then failure is determined by checking  if  anything  in  the  compiler
              output matches any of the specified regular expressions.

              Internally,  <u>try_compile()</u>  is used to compile the source. If <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u> is set
              to <b>EXECUTABLE</b> (default), the source is compiled and linked as an executable  program.  If  set  to
              <b>STATIC_LIBRARY</b>, the source is compiled but not linked. In any case, all functions must be declared
              as usual.

              See also <u>check_source_compiles()</u> for a more general command syntax.

              See also <u>check_source_runs()</u> to run compiled source.

              The compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following variables prior to
              calling <b>check_objc_source_compiles()</b>

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String  of  additional  flags  to  pass  to the compiler. The string must be space-delimited--a
                 <u>;-list</u>  will   not   work.    The   contents   of   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u>   and   its   associated
                 configuration-specific  variable  are  automatically  added  to the compiler command before the
                 contents of <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of compiler definitions of the form <b>-DFOO</b> or <b>-DFOO=bar</b>.  A  definition  for  the  name
                 specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b> will also be added automatically.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS</b>
                 Added in version 3.14.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of options to add to the link command (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of libraries to add to the link command. These can be the name of system libraries  or

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
                 Added in version 3.31.

                 details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status  messages  associated  with  the
                 check will be suppressed.

   <b>CheckOBJCSourceRuns</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Check once if given Objective-C source compiles and links into an executable and can subsequently be run.

       <b>check_objc_source_runs</b>

                 check_objc_source_runs(&lt;code&gt; &lt;resultVar&gt;)

              Check once that the source supplied in <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> can be built, linked as an executable, and then run.
              The <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> must contain at least a <b>main()</b> function.

              The result is stored in the internal cache variable specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b>. Success of build and
              run  is  indicated by boolean <b>true</b>.  Failure to build or run is indicated by boolean <b>false</b> such as
              an empty string or an error message.

              See also <u>check_source_runs()</u> for a more general command syntax.

              The compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following variables prior to
              calling <b>check_objc_source_runs()</b>

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String of additional flags to pass to the  compiler.  The  string  must  be  space-delimited--a

                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of  compiler  definitions  of the form <b>-DFOO</b> or <b>-DFOO=bar</b>. A definition for the name
                 specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b> will also be added automatically.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of header search paths to pass to the compiler. These will be the only  header  search
                 paths used--the contents of the <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> directory property will be ignored.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS</b>
                 Added in version 3.14.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of options to add to the link command (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u> of libraries to add to the link command. These can be the name of system libraries or
                 they can be <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
                 Added in version 3.31.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of libraries search paths to  pass  to  the  linker  (see  <u>try_compile()</u>  for  further
                 details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If  this  variable  evaluates  to a boolean true value, all status messages associated with the
                 check will be suppressed.

   <b>CheckOBJCXXCompilerFlag</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Check once whether the Objective-C++ compiler supports a given flag.

       <b>check_objcxx_compiler_flag</b>

                 check_objcxx_compiler_flag(&lt;flag&gt; &lt;resultVar&gt;)

       Check once that the <b>&lt;flag&gt;</b> is accepted by the compiler without a diagnostic.  The result is stored in the
       internal cache variable specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b>, with boolean <b>true</b> for success  and  boolean  <b>false</b>  for
       failure.

       <b>true</b> indicates only that the compiler did not issue a diagnostic message when given the flag. Whether the
       flag has any effect is beyond the scope of this module.

       Internally,  <u>try_compile()</u>  is  used  to  perform  the  check. If <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u> is set to
       <b>EXECUTABLE</b> (default), the check compiles and links an executable program. If set to  <b>STATIC_LIBRARY</b>,  the
       check is compiled but not linked.

       See also <u>check_compiler_flag()</u> for a more general command syntax.

       The  compile  and  link  commands  can  be  influenced by setting any of the following variables prior to
       calling <b>check_objcxx_compiler_flag()</b>. Unknown flags in these variables can case a false negative result.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String of additional flags to pass to the  compiler.  The  string  must  be  space-delimited--a
                 <u>;-list</u>   will   not   work.    The   contents   of   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u>   and   its  associated
                 configuration-specific variable are automatically added to  the  compiler  command  before  the
                 contents of <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of  compiler  definitions  of the form <b>-DFOO</b> or <b>-DFOO=bar</b>. A definition for the name
                 specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b> will also be added automatically.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of header search paths to pass to the compiler. These will be the only  header  search
                 paths used--the contents of the <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> directory property will be ignored.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS</b>
                 Added in version 3.14.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of options to add to the link command (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u> of libraries to add to the link command. These can be the name of system libraries or

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
                 Added in version 3.31.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of libraries search paths to  pass  to  the  linker  (see  <u>try_compile()</u>  for  further
                 details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If  this  variable  evaluates  to a boolean true value, all status messages associated with the
                 check will be suppressed.

   <b>CheckOBJCXXSourceCompiles</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Check once if Objective-C++ source can be built.

       <b>check_objcxx_source_compiles</b>

                 check_objcxx_source_compiles(&lt;code&gt; &lt;resultVar&gt;
                                              [FAIL_REGEX &lt;regex1&gt; [&lt;regex2&gt;...]])

              Check once that the source supplied in <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> can be built. The result is stored in  the  internal
              cache  variable  specified  by  <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b>,  with  boolean <b>true</b> for success and boolean <b>false</b> for
              failure.

              If <b>FAIL_REGEX</b> is provided, then failure is determined by checking  if  anything  in  the  compiler
              output matches any of the specified regular expressions.

              Internally,  <u>try_compile()</u>  is used to compile the source. If <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u> is set
              to <b>EXECUTABLE</b> (default), the source is compiled and linked as an executable  program.  If  set  to
              <b>STATIC_LIBRARY</b>, the source is compiled but not linked. In any case, all functions must be declared
              as usual.

              See also <u>check_source_compiles()</u> for a more general command syntax.

              See also <u>check_source_runs()</u> to run compiled source.

              The compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following variables prior to

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of compiler definitions of the form <b>-DFOO</b> or <b>-DFOO=bar</b>.  A  definition  for  the  name
                 specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b> will also be added automatically.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of header search paths to pass to the compiler. These will be the only header search

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status  messages  associated  with  the
                 check will be suppressed.

   <b>CheckOBJCXXSourceRuns</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       Check  once  if  given Objective-C++ source compiles and links into an executable and can subsequently be
       run.

       <b>check_objcxx_source_runs</b>

                 check_objcxx_source_runs(&lt;code&gt; &lt;resultVar&gt;)

              Check once that the source supplied in <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> can be built, linked as an executable, and then run.
              The <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> must contain at least a <b>main()</b> function.

              The result is stored in the internal cache variable specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b>. Success of build and
              run is indicated by boolean <b>true</b>.  Failure to build or run is indicated by boolean <b>false</b>  such  as
              an empty string or an error message.

              See also <u>check_source_runs()</u> for a more general command syntax.

              The compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following variables prior to
              calling <b>check_objcxx_source_runs()</b>

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String  of  additional  flags  to  pass  to the compiler. The string must be space-delimited--a

                 If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status  messages  associated  with  the
                 check will be suppressed.

   <b>CheckPIESupported</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       Check  whether  the  linker  supports  Position  Independent  Code  (PIE) or No Position Independent Code
       (NO_PIE) for executables.  Use this to ensure that  the  <u>POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE</u>  target  property  for
       executables will be honored at link time.

       <b>check_pie_supported</b>

                 check_pie_supported([OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;output&gt;]
                                     [LANGUAGES &lt;lang&gt;...])

              Options are:

              <b>OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> <b>&lt;output&gt;</b>
                     Set  <b>&lt;output&gt;</b>  variable  with  details about any error. If the check is bypassed because it
                     uses cached results from a previous call, the output will be  empty  even  if  errors  were
                     present in the previous call.

              <b>LANGUAGES</b> <b>&lt;lang&gt;...</b>
                     Check  the  linkers  used  for  each  of  the  specified  languages.  If this option is not
                     provided, the command checks all enabled languages.

                     <b>C</b>, <b>CXX</b>, <b>Fortran</b> are supported.

                     Added in version 3.23: <b>OBJC</b>, <b>OBJCXX</b>, <b>CUDA</b>, and <b>HIP</b> are supported.

       It makes no sense to use this module when <u>CMP0083</u> is set to <b>OLD</b>, so the command will return an  error  in
       this case.  See policy <u>CMP0083</u> for details.

   <b>Variables</b>
       For each language checked, two boolean cache variables are defined.

          <b>CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_LINK_PIE_SUPPORTED</b>
                 Set to true if <b>PIE</b> is supported by the linker and false otherwise.

          <b>CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_LINK_NO_PIE_SUPPORTED</b>
                 Set to true if <b>NO_PIE</b> is supported by the linker and false otherwise.

   <b>Examples</b>
          check_pie_supported()
          set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE TRUE)

          # Retrieve any error message.
          check_pie_supported(OUTPUT_VARIABLE output LANGUAGES C)
          set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE TRUE)
          if(NOT CMAKE_C_LINK_PIE_SUPPORTED)
            message(WARNING "PIE is not supported at link time: ${output}.\n"
                            "PIE link options will not be passed to linker.")
          endif()

   <b>CheckPrototypeDefinition</b>
       Check if the prototype we expect is correct.

       <b>check_prototype_definition</b>

                 check_prototype_definition(FUNCTION PROTOTYPE RETURN HEADER VARIABLE)

                 FUNCTION - The name of the function (used to check if prototype exists)
                 PROTOTYPE- The prototype to check.
                 RETURN - The return value of the function.
                 HEADER - The header files required.
                 VARIABLE - The variable to store the result.
                            Will be created as an internal cache variable.

              Example:

                 check_prototype_definition(getpwent_r
                  "struct passwd *getpwent_r(struct passwd *src, char *buf, int buflen)"
                  "NULL"
                  "unistd.h;pwd.h"
                  SOLARIS_GETPWENT_R)

       The following variables may be set before calling this function to modify the way the check is run:

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String  of  additional  flags  to  pass  to the compiler. The string must be space-delimited--a
                 <u>;-list</u>  will   not   work.    The   contents   of   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u>   and   its   associated
                 configuration-specific  variable  are  automatically  added  to the compiler command before the
                 contents of <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of compiler definitions of the form <b>-DFOO</b> or <b>-DFOO=bar</b>.  A  definition  for  the  name
                 specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b> will also be added automatically.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of header search paths to pass to the compiler. These will be the only header search
                 paths used--the contents of the <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> directory property will be ignored.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS</b>
                 Added in version 3.14.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of options to add to the link command (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of libraries to add to the link command. These can be the name of system libraries  or
                 they can be <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
                 Added in version 3.31.

                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of  libraries  search  paths  to  pass  to the linker (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further
                 details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status  messages  associated  with  the
                 check will be suppressed.

   <b>CheckSourceCompiles</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       Check once if source code can be built for a given language.

       <b>check_source_compiles</b>

                 check_source_compiles(&lt;lang&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;resultVar&gt;
                                       [FAIL_REGEX &lt;regex1&gt; [&lt;regex2&gt;...]]
                                       [SRC_EXT &lt;extension&gt;])

              Check once that the source supplied in <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> can be built for code language <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>. The result is
              stored  in the internal cache variable specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b>, with boolean <b>true</b> for success and
              boolean <b>false</b> for failure.

              If <b>FAIL_REGEX</b> is provided, then failure is determined by checking  if  anything  in  the  compiler
              output matches any of the specified regular expressions.

              By  default,  the  test  source  file  will  be  given a file extension that matches the requested
              language. The <b>SRC_EXT</b> option can be used to override this with <b>.&lt;extension&gt;</b> instead.

              The C example checks if the compiler supports the <b>noreturn</b> attribute:

                 set(CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE "STATIC_LIBRARY")

                 check_source_compiles(C
                 "#if !__has_c_attribute(noreturn)
                 #error \"No noreturn attribute\"
                 #endif"
                 HAVE_NORETURN)

              The Fortran example checks if the compiler supports the <b>pure</b> procedure attribute:

                 set(CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE "STATIC_LIBRARY")

                 check_source_compiles(Fortran
                 "pure subroutine foo()
                 end subroutine"
                 HAVE_PURE)

              Internally, <u>try_compile()</u> is used to compile the source. If <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u>  is  set
              to  <b>EXECUTABLE</b>  (default),  the  source is compiled and linked as an executable program. If set to
              <b>STATIC_LIBRARY</b>, the source is compiled but not linked. In any case, all functions must be declared
              as usual.

              See also <u>check_source_runs()</u> to run compiled source.

              The compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following variables prior to

                 Added in version 3.31.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of libraries search paths to  pass  to  the  linker  (see  <u>try_compile()</u>  for  further
                 details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If  this  variable  evaluates  to a boolean true value, all status messages associated with the
                 check will be suppressed.

   <b>CheckSourceRuns</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       Check if given source compiles and links into an executable and can subsequently be run.

       <b>check_source_runs</b>

                 check_source_runs(&lt;lang&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;resultVar&gt;
                                   [SRC_EXT &lt;extension&gt;])

              Check once that the <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> source supplied in <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> can be built, linked as  an  executable,  and
              then run. The <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> must contain at least a <b>main()</b> function, or in Fortran a <b>program</b>.

              The result is stored in the internal cache variable specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b>. Success of build and
              run  is  indicated by boolean <b>true</b>.  Failure to build or run is indicated by boolean <b>false</b> such as
              an empty string or an error message.

              By default, the test source file will be  given  a  file  extension  that  matches  the  requested
              language. The <b>SRC_EXT</b> option can be used to override this with <b>.&lt;extension&gt;</b> instead.

              The <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> must contain a valid main program. For example:

                 check_source_runs(C
                 "#include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;

                 int main(void) { f(); return 1; }"
                 HAVE_NORETURN)

                 check_source_runs(Fortran
                 "program test

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of header search paths to pass to the compiler. These will be the only header search

   <b>CheckStructHasMember</b>
       Check if the given struct or class has the specified member variable

       <b>CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER</b>

                 CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER(&lt;struct&gt; &lt;member&gt; &lt;header&gt; &lt;variable&gt;
                                         [LANGUAGE &lt;language&gt;])

                 &lt;struct&gt; - the name of the struct or class you are interested in
                 &lt;member&gt; - the member which existence you want to check

                 &lt;language&gt; - the compiler to use (C or CXX)

       The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify the way the check is run:

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String  of  additional  flags  to  pass  to the compiler. The string must be space-delimited--a

                 contents of <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of compiler definitions of the form <b>-DFOO</b> or <b>-DFOO=bar</b>.  A  definition  for  the  name
                 specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b> will also be added automatically.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of header search paths to pass to the compiler. These will be the only header search
                 paths used--the contents of the <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> directory property will be ignored.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS</b>
                 Added in version 3.14.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of options to add to the link command (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of libraries to add to the link command. These can be the name of system libraries  or
                 they can be <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
                 Added in version 3.31.

                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of  libraries  search  paths  to  pass  to the linker (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further
                 details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status  messages  associated  with  the
                 check will be suppressed.

       Example:

          CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER("struct timeval" tv_sec sys/select.h
                                  HAVE_TIMEVAL_TV_SEC LANGUAGE C)

   <b>CheckSymbolExists</b>
       Provides a macro to check if a symbol exists as a function, variable, or macro in <b>C</b>.

       <b>check_symbol_exists</b>

                 check_symbol_exists(&lt;symbol&gt; &lt;files&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)

              Check  that the <b>&lt;symbol&gt;</b> is available after including given header <b>&lt;files&gt;</b> and store the result in
              a <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>.  Specify  the  list  of  files  in  one  argument  as  a  semicolon-separated  list.
              <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> will be created as an internal cache variable.

       If  the header files define the symbol as a macro it is considered available and assumed to work.  If the
       header files declare the symbol as a function or variable then the symbol  must  also  be  available  for
       linking  (so  intrinsics may not be detected).  If the symbol is a type, enum value, or intrinsic it will
       not be recognized (consider using <u>CheckTypeSize</u> or <u>CheckSourceCompiles</u>).  If the check needs to  be  done
       in C++, consider using <u>CheckCXXSymbolExists</u> instead.

       The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify the way the check is run:

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String  of  additional  flags  to  pass  to the compiler. The string must be space-delimited--a
                 <u>;-list</u>  will   not   work.    The   contents   of   <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS</u>   and   its   associated
                 configuration-specific  variable  are  automatically  added  to the compiler command before the
                 contents of <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of compiler definitions of the form <b>-DFOO</b> or <b>-DFOO=bar</b>.  A  definition  for  the  name
                 specified by <b>&lt;resultVar&gt;</b> will also be added automatically.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</b>
                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of header search paths to pass to the compiler. These will be the only header search
                 paths used--the contents of the <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> directory property will be ignored.

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS</b>
                 Added in version 3.14.

                 A <u>;-list</u> of options to add to the link command (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of libraries to add to the link command. These can be the name of system libraries  or
                 they can be <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>
                 Added in version 3.31.

                 A  <u>;-list</u>  of  libraries  search  paths  to  pass  to the linker (see <u>try_compile()</u> for further
                 details).

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status  messages  associated  with  the
                 check will be suppressed.

       For example:

          include(CheckSymbolExists)

          # Check for macro SEEK_SET
          check_symbol_exists(SEEK_SET "stdio.h" HAVE_SEEK_SET)
          # Check for function fopen
          check_symbol_exists(fopen "stdio.h" HAVE_FOPEN)

   <b>CheckTypeSize</b>
       Check sizeof a type

       <b>check_type_size</b>

                 check_type_size(&lt;type&gt; &lt;variable&gt; [BUILTIN_TYPES_ONLY]
                                                   [LANGUAGE &lt;language&gt;])

              Check if the type exists and determine its size.  Results are reported in the following variables:

              <b>HAVE_&lt;variable&gt;</b>
                     Holds a true or false value indicating whether the type exists.

              <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>
                     Holds one of the following values:

                     <b>&lt;size&gt;</b> Type has non-zero size <b>&lt;size&gt;</b>.

                     <b>0</b>      Type  has  architecture-dependent size.  This may occur when <u>CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES</u>
                            has multiple architectures.  In this case <b>&lt;variable&gt;_CODE</b>  contains  C  preprocessor
                            tests mapping from each architecture macro to the corresponding type size.  The list
                            of  architecture  macros is stored in <b>&lt;variable&gt;_KEYS</b>, and the value for each key is
                            stored in <b>&lt;variable&gt;-&lt;key&gt;</b>.

                     <b>""</b> <b>(empty</b> <b>string)</b>
                            Type does not exist.

              <b>&lt;variable&gt;_CODE</b>
                     Holds C preprocessor code to define the macro <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> to the size of  the  type,  or  to
                     leave the macro undefined if the type does not exist.

              The options are:

              <b>BUILTIN_TYPES_ONLY</b>
                 Support only compiler-builtin types.  If <u>not</u> given, the macro checks for headers <b>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</b>,
                 <b>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</b>,   and  <b>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</b>,  and  saves  results  in  <b>HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H</b>,  <b>HAVE_STDINT_H</b>,  and
                 <b>HAVE_STDDEF_H</b>.  The  type  size  check  automatically  includes  the  available  headers,  thus
                 supporting checks of types defined in the headers.

              <b>LANGUAGE</b> <b>&lt;language&gt;</b>
                     Use the <b>&lt;language&gt;</b> compiler to perform the check.  Acceptable values are <b>C</b> and <b>CXX</b>.

       Despite  the  name  of  the  macro you may use it to check the size of more complex expressions, too.  To
       check e.g.  for the size of a struct member you can do something like this:

          check_type_size("((struct something*)0)-&gt;member" SIZEOF_MEMBER)

       The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify the way the check is run:

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String of additional flags to pass to the  compiler.  The  string  must  be  space-delimited--a

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</b>
                 A <u>;-list</u> of header search paths to pass to the compiler. These will be the only  header  search

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET</b>
                 Added in version 3.1.

                 If  this  variable  evaluates  to a boolean true value, all status messages associated with the
                 check will be suppressed.

       <b>CMAKE_EXTRA_INCLUDE_FILES</b>
              list of extra headers to include.

   <b>CheckVariableExists</b>
       Check if the variable exists.

       <b>CHECK_VARIABLE_EXISTS</b>

                 CHECK_VARIABLE_EXISTS(VAR VARIABLE)

                 VAR      - the name of the variable
                 VARIABLE - variable to store the result
                            Will be created as an internal cache variable.

              This macro is only for <b>C</b> variables.

       The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify the way the check is run:

          <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>
                 String of additional flags to pass to the  compiler.  The  string  must  be  space-delimited--a

                 If  this  variable  evaluates  to a boolean true value, all status messages associated with the
                 check will be suppressed.

   <b>CMakeAddFortranSubdirectory</b>
       Add a fortran-only subdirectory, find a fortran compiler, and build.

       The <b>cmake_add_fortran_subdirectory</b> function adds a subdirectory to a project that contains a fortran-only
       subproject.  The module will check the current compiler and see if it can support fortran.  If no fortran
       compiler is found and the compiler is MSVC, then this module will find the MinGW gfortran.  It will  then
       use  an  external  project  to  build with the MinGW tools.  It will also create imported targets for the
       libraries created.  This will only work if the fortran code is built into a dll, so <u>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</u>  is
       turned  on  in  the  project.   In addition the <u>CMAKE_GNUtoMS</u> option is set to on, so that Microsoft <b>.lib</b>
       files are created.  Usage is as follows:

          cmake_add_fortran_subdirectory(
           &lt;subdir&gt;                # name of subdirectory
           PROJECT &lt;project_name&gt;  # project name in subdir top CMakeLists.txt
           ARCHIVE_DIR &lt;dir&gt;       # dir where project places .lib files
           RUNTIME_DIR &lt;dir&gt;       # dir where project places .dll files
           LIBRARIES &lt;lib&gt;...      # names of library targets to import
           LINK_LIBRARIES          # link interface libraries for LIBRARIES
            [LINK_LIBS &lt;lib&gt; &lt;dep&gt;...]...
           CMAKE_COMMAND_LINE ...  # extra command line flags to pass to cmake
           NO_EXTERNAL_INSTALL     # skip installation of external project
           )

       Relative paths in <b>ARCHIVE_DIR</b> and <b>RUNTIME_DIR</b>  are  interpreted  with  respect  to  the  build  directory
       corresponding to the source directory in which the function is invoked.

       Limitations:

       <b>NO_EXTERNAL_INSTALL</b>   is  required  for  forward  compatibility  with  a  future  version  that  supports
       installation of the external project binaries during <b>make</b> <b>install</b>.

   <b>CMakeBackwardCompatibilityCXX</b>
       define a bunch of backwards compatibility variables

          CMAKE_ANSI_CXXFLAGS - flag for ansi c++
          CMAKE_HAS_ANSI_STRING_STREAM - has &lt;strstream&gt;
          include(TestForANSIStreamHeaders)
          include(CheckIncludeFileCXX)
          include(TestForSTDNamespace)
          include(TestForANSIForScope)

   <b>CMakeDependentOption</b>
       Macro to provide an option dependent on other options.

       This macro presents an option to the user only if a set of other conditions are true.

       <b>cmake_dependent_option</b>

                 cmake_dependent_option(&lt;option&gt; "&lt;help_text&gt;" &lt;value&gt; &lt;depends&gt; &lt;force&gt;)

              Makes <b>&lt;option&gt;</b> available to the user if the <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> of  conditions  in  <b>&lt;depends&gt;</b>
              are all true.  Otherwise, a local variable named <b>&lt;option&gt;</b> is set to <b>&lt;force&gt;</b>.

              When  <b>&lt;option&gt;</b>  is  available,  the given <b>&lt;help_text&gt;</b> and initial <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> are used. Otherwise, any
              value set by the user is preserved for when <b>&lt;depends&gt;</b> is satisfied in the future.

              Note that the <b>&lt;option&gt;</b> variable only has a value which satisfies the  <b>&lt;depends&gt;</b>  condition  within
              the scope of the caller because it is a local variable.

       Example invocation:

          cmake_dependent_option(USE_FOO "Use Foo" ON "USE_BAR;NOT USE_ZOT" OFF)

       If  <b>USE_BAR</b>  is  true  and  <b>USE_ZOT</b> is false, this provides an option called <b>USE_FOO</b> that defaults to ON.
       Otherwise, it sets <b>USE_FOO</b> to OFF and hides the option from the user. If the status of <b>USE_BAR</b> or <b>USE_ZOT</b>
       ever changes, any value for the <b>USE_FOO</b> option is saved so that when the option is re-enabled it  retains
       its old value.

       Added in version 3.22: Full <u>Condition</u> <u>Syntax</u> is now supported.  See policy <u>CMP0127</u>.

   <b>CMakeFindDependencyMacro</b>
       <b>find_dependency</b>
              The <b>find_dependency()</b> macro wraps a <u>find_package()</u> call for a package dependency:

                 find_dependency(&lt;dep&gt; [...])

              It   is  designed  to  be  used  in  a  <u>Package</u>  <u>Configuration</u>  <u>File</u>  (<b>&lt;PackageName&gt;Config.cmake</b>).
              <b>find_dependency</b> forwards the correct parameters for <b>QUIET</b> and <b>REQUIRED</b> which were  passed  to  the
              original <u>find_package()</u> call.  Any additional arguments specified are forwarded to <u>find_package()</u>.

              If  the dependency could not be found it sets an informative diagnostic message and calls <u>return()</u>
              to end processing of the calling package configuration  file  and  return  to  the  <u>find_package()</u>
              command that loaded it.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 The call to <u>return()</u> makes this macro unsuitable to call from <u>Find</u> <u>Modules</u>.

   <b>Package</b> <b>Dependency</b> <b>Search</b> <b>Optimizations</b>
       If  <b>find_dependency</b>  is called with arguments identical to a previous call in the same directory, perhaps
       due to diamond-shaped package dependencies, the underlying call to <u>find_package()</u> is optimized out.  This
       optimization is important to support large package  dependency  graphs  while  avoiding  a  combinatorial
       explosion  of repeated searches.  However, the heuristic cannot account for ambient variables that affect
       package behavior, such as <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_USE_STATIC_LIBS</b>, offered by  some  packages.   Therefore  package
       configuration files should avoid setting such variables before their calls to <b>find_dependency</b>.

       Changed  in  version  3.15: Previously, the underlying call to <u>find_package()</u> was always optimized out if
       the package had already been found.  CMake 3.15 removed  the  optimization  to  support  cases  in  which
       <b>find_dependency</b> call arguments request different components.

       Changed  in  version 3.26: The pre-3.15 optimization was restored, but with the above-described heuristic
       to account for varying <b>find_dependency</b> call arguments.

   <b>CMakeFindPackageMode</b>
       This file is executed by cmake when invoked with <u>--find-package</u>.  It expects that the following variables
       are set using <b>-D</b>:

       <b>NAME</b>   name of the package

       <b>COMPILER_ID</b>
              the CMake compiler ID for which the result is, i.e. GNU/Intel/Clang/MSVC, etc.

       <b>LANGUAGE</b>
              language for which the result will be used, i.e. C/CXX/Fortran/ASM

       <b>MODE</b>

              <b>EXIST</b>  only check for existence of the given package

              <b>COMPILE</b>
                     print the flags needed for compiling an object file which uses the given package

              <b>LINK</b>   print the flags needed for linking when using the given package

       <b>QUIET</b>  if TRUE, don't print anything

   <b>CMakeGraphVizOptions</b>
       The builtin Graphviz support of CMake.

   <b>Generating</b> <b>Graphviz</b> <b>files</b>
       CMake can generate <u>Graphviz</u> files showing the dependencies between the targets in a project, as  well  as
       external libraries which are linked against.

       When running CMake with the <b>--graphviz=foo.dot</b> option, it produces:

       • a <b>foo.dot</b> file, showing all dependencies in the project

       • a <b>foo.dot.&lt;target&gt;</b> file for each target, showing on which other targets it depends

       • a <b>foo.dot.&lt;target&gt;.dependers</b> file for each target, showing which other targets depend on it

       Those .dot files can be converted to images using the <u>dot</u> command from the Graphviz package:

          dot -Tpng -o foo.png foo.dot

       Added  in  version  3.10: The different dependency types <b>PUBLIC</b>, <b>INTERFACE</b> and <b>PRIVATE</b> are represented as
       solid, dashed and dotted edges.

   <b>Variables</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Graphviz</b> <b>support</b>
       The resulting graphs can be huge.  The look and content of the generated graphs can be  controlled  using
       the  file  <b>CMakeGraphVizOptions.cmake</b>.   This  file  is  first  searched in <u>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</u>, and then in
       <u>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</u>.  If found, the variables set in it  are  used  to  adjust  options  for  the  generated
       Graphviz files.

       <b>GRAPHVIZ_GRAPH_NAME</b>
              The graph name.

              • Mandatory: NO

              • Default: value of <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME</u>

       <b>GRAPHVIZ_GRAPH_HEADER</b>
              The header written at the top of the Graphviz files.

              • Mandatory: NO

              • Default: "node [ fontsize = "12" ];"

       <b>GRAPHVIZ_NODE_PREFIX</b>
              The prefix for each node in the Graphviz files.

              • Mandatory: NO

              • Default: "node"

       <b>GRAPHVIZ_EXECUTABLES</b>
              Set to FALSE to exclude executables from the generated graphs.

              • Mandatory: NO

              • Default: TRUE

       <b>GRAPHVIZ_STATIC_LIBS</b>
              Set to FALSE to exclude static libraries from the generated graphs.

              • Mandatory: NO

              • Default: TRUE

       <b>GRAPHVIZ_SHARED_LIBS</b>
              Set to FALSE to exclude shared libraries from the generated graphs.

              • Mandatory: NO

              • Default: TRUE

       <b>GRAPHVIZ_MODULE_LIBS</b>
              Set to FALSE to exclude module libraries from the generated graphs.

              • Mandatory: NO

              • Default: TRUE

       <b>GRAPHVIZ_INTERFACE_LIBS</b>
              Set to FALSE to exclude interface libraries from the generated graphs.

              • Mandatory: NO

              • Default: TRUE

       <b>GRAPHVIZ_OBJECT_LIBS</b>
              Set to FALSE to exclude object libraries from the generated graphs.

              • Mandatory: NO

              • Default: TRUE

       <b>GRAPHVIZ_UNKNOWN_LIBS</b>
              Set to FALSE to exclude unknown libraries from the generated graphs.

              • Mandatory: NO

              • Default: TRUE

       <b>GRAPHVIZ_EXTERNAL_LIBS</b>
              Set to FALSE to exclude external libraries from the generated graphs.

              • Mandatory: NO

       <b>GRAPHVIZ_CUSTOM_TARGETS</b>
              Set to TRUE to include custom targets in the generated graphs.

              • Mandatory: NO

              • Default: FALSE

       <b>GRAPHVIZ_IGNORE_TARGETS</b>
              A list of regular expressions for names of targets to exclude from the generated graphs.

              • Mandatory: NO

              • Default: empty

       <b>GRAPHVIZ_GENERATE_PER_TARGET</b>
              Set to FALSE to not generate per-target graphs <b>foo.dot.&lt;target&gt;</b>.

              • Mandatory: NO

              • Default: TRUE

       <b>GRAPHVIZ_GENERATE_DEPENDERS</b>
              Set to FALSE to not generate depender graphs <b>foo.dot.&lt;target&gt;.dependers</b>.

              • Mandatory: NO

              • Default: TRUE

   <b>CMakePackageConfigHelpers</b>
       Helper  functions  for  creating  config  files  that can be included by other projects to find and use a
       package.

   <b>Generating</b> <b>a</b> <b>Package</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>File</b>
       <b>configure_package_config_file</b>
              Create a config file for a project:

                 configure_package_config_file(&lt;input&gt; &lt;output&gt;
                   INSTALL_DESTINATION &lt;path&gt;
                   [PATH_VARS &lt;var1&gt; &lt;var2&gt; ... &lt;varN&gt;]
                   [NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO]
                   [NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS_MACRO]
                   [INSTALL_PREFIX &lt;path&gt;]
                   )

       <b>configure_package_config_file()</b> should be  used  instead  of  the  plain  <u>configure_file()</u>  command  when
       creating  the  <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;Config.cmake</b>  or  <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;-config.cmake</b> file for installing a project or
       library.  It helps make the resulting package relocatable by avoiding hardcoded paths  in  the  installed
       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;Config.cmake</b> file.

       In a <b>FooConfig.cmake</b> file there may be code like this to make the install destinations known to the using
       project:

          set(FOO_INCLUDE_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_INCLUDEDIR@" )
          set(FOO_DATA_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@RELATIVE_DATA_INSTALL_DIR@" )
          set(FOO_ICONS_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/icons" )
          #...logic to determine installedPrefix from the own location...
          set(FOO_CONFIG_DIR  "${installedPrefix}/@CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR@" )

       All  four  options  shown  above  are  not  sufficient   The  first three hardcode the absolute directory
       locations.  The fourth case works only if the logic to determine the <b>installedPrefix</b> is correct,  and  if
       <b>CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR</b>  contains a relative path, which in general cannot be guaranteed.  This has the effect
       that the resulting <b>FooConfig.cmake</b> file would work poorly under Windows and macOS, where users  are  used
       to   choosing  the  install  location  of  a  binary  package  at  install  time,  independent  from  how
       <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> was set at build/cmake time.

       Using <b>configure_package_config_file()</b> helps.  If used correctly, it makes the  resulting  <b>FooConfig.cmake</b>
       file relocatable.  Usage:

       1. Write a <b>FooConfig.cmake.in</b> file as you are used to.

       2. Insert a line at the top containing only the string <b>@PACKAGE_INIT@</b>.

       3. Instead of <b>set(FOO_DIR</b> <b>"@SOME_INSTALL_DIR@")</b>, use <b>set(FOO_DIR</b> <b>"@PACKAGE_SOME_INSTALL_DIR@")</b> (this must
          be after the <b>@PACKAGE_INIT@</b> line).

       4. Instead of using the normal <u>configure_file()</u> command, use <b>configure_package_config_file()</b>.

       The <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;output&gt;</b> arguments are the input and output file, the same way as in <u>configure_file()</u>.

       The  <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>  given  to <b>INSTALL_DESTINATION</b> must be the destination where the <b>FooConfig.cmake</b> file will be
       installed to.  This path can either be absolute, or relative to the <b>INSTALL_PREFIX</b> path.

       The variables <b>&lt;var1&gt;</b> to <b>&lt;varN&gt;</b> given as <b>PATH_VARS</b> are the variables which contain  install  destinations.
       For  each of them, the macro will create a helper variable <b>PACKAGE_&lt;var...&gt;</b>.  These helper variables must
       be used in the <b>FooConfig.cmake.in</b> file for setting  the  installed  location.   They  are  calculated  by
       <b>configure_package_config_file()</b>  so  that  they  are  always  relative  to  the installed location of the
       package.  This works both for relative and also for absolute locations.  For absolute locations, it works
       only if the absolute location is a subdirectory of <b>INSTALL_PREFIX</b>.

       Added in version 3.30: The variable <b>PACKAGE_PREFIX_DIR</b> will always be defined  after  the  <b>@PACKAGE_INIT@</b>
       line.   It  will  hold  the  value  of  the base install location.  In general, variables defined via the
       <b>PATH_VARS</b> mechanism should be used instead, but <b>PACKAGE_PREFIX_DIR</b> can be used for those cases not easily
       handled by <b>PATH_VARS</b>, such as for files installed directly to the base install  location  rather  than  a
       subdirectory of it.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          When  consumers  of the generated file use CMake 3.29 or older, the value of <b>PACKAGE_PREFIX_DIR</b> can be
          changed by a call to <u>find_dependency()</u> or <u>find_package()</u>.  If a project relies on  <b>PACKAGE_PREFIX_DIR</b>,
          it  is the project's responsibility to ensure that the value of <b>PACKAGE_PREFIX_DIR</b> is preserved across
          any  such  calls,  or  any   other   calls   which   might   include   another   file   generated   by
          <b>configure_package_config_file()</b>.

       Added  in  version  3.1:  If  the  <b>INSTALL_PREFIX</b>  argument  is  passed, this is used as the base path to
       calculate all the relative paths.  The <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> argument must be an absolute path.  If this argument is not
       passed, the <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> variable  will  be  used  instead.   The  default  value  is  good  when
       generating  a  <b>FooConfig.cmake</b>  file  to  use  your  package  from  the  install tree.  When generating a
       <b>FooConfig.cmake</b> file to use your package from the build tree, this option should be used.

       By default,  <b>configure_package_config_file()</b>  also  generates  two  helper  macros,  <b>set_and_check()</b>  and
       <b>check_required_components()</b>, into the <b>FooConfig.cmake</b> file.

       <b>set_and_check()</b>  should  be  used  instead  of  the normal <u>set()</u> command for setting directories and file
       locations.  In addition to setting the variable, it also checks that the  referenced  file  or  directory
       actually  exists  and  fails  with  a  fatal  error  if  it  doesn't.   This  ensures  that the generated
       <b>FooConfig.cmake</b> file does not contain wrong references.  Add the <b>NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO</b> option to prevent
       the generation of the <b>set_and_check()</b> macro in the <b>FooConfig.cmake</b> file.

       <b>check_required_components(&lt;PackageName&gt;)</b> should be called at the end of the  <b>FooConfig.cmake</b>  file.  This
       macro checks whether all requested, non-optional components have been found, and if this is not the case,
       it  sets the <b>Foo_FOUND</b> variable to <b>FALSE</b> so that the package is considered to be not found.  It does that
       by testing the <b>Foo_&lt;Component&gt;_FOUND</b> variables for all requested required components.  This macro  should
       be  called  even  if  the  package  doesn't  provide any components to make sure users are not specifying
       components erroneously.  Add the <b>NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS_MACRO</b> option to prevent the  generation  of
       the <b>check_required_components()</b> macro in the <b>FooConfig.cmake</b> file.

       See also <u>Example</u> <u>Generating</u> <u>Package</u> <u>Files</u>.

   <b>Generating</b> <b>a</b> <b>Package</b> <b>Version</b> <b>File</b>
       <b>write_basic_package_version_file</b>
              Create a version file for a project:

                 write_basic_package_version_file(&lt;filename&gt;
                   [VERSION &lt;major.minor.patch&gt;]
                   COMPATIBILITY &lt;AnyNewerVersion|SameMajorVersion|SameMinorVersion|ExactVersion&gt;
                   [ARCH_INDEPENDENT] )

       Writes a file for use as a <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;ConfigVersion.cmake</b> file to <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>.  See the documentation of
       <u>find_package()</u> for details on such files.

       <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> is the output filename, which should be in the build tree.  <b>&lt;major.minor.patch&gt;</b> is the version
       number of the project to be installed.

       If no <b>VERSION</b> is given, the <u>PROJECT_VERSION</u> variable is used.  If this hasn't been set, it errors out.

       The  <b>COMPATIBILITY</b>  mode  <b>AnyNewerVersion</b>  means  that  the  installed package version will be considered
       compatible if it is newer or exactly the same as the requested version.  This mode  should  be  used  for
       packages  which  are  fully backward compatible, also across major versions.  If <b>SameMajorVersion</b> is used
       instead, then the behavior differs from <b>AnyNewerVersion</b> in that the major version number must be the same
       as requested, e.g.  version 2.0 will not be considered compatible if 1.0 is requested.  This mode  should
       be  used  for  packages  which  guarantee  backward  compatibility  within  the  same  major version.  If
       <b>SameMinorVersion</b> is used, the behavior is the same as <b>SameMajorVersion</b>, but both major and minor  version
       must  be  the  same  as  requested,  e.g  version  0.2  will  not  be compatible if 0.1 is requested.  If
       <b>ExactVersion</b> is used, then the package is only considered compatible if  the  requested  version  matches
       exactly  its  own  version  number  (not considering the tweak version).  For example, version 1.2.3 of a
       package is only considered compatible to requested version 1.2.3.  This  mode  is  for  packages  without
       compatibility  guarantees.   If  your project has more elaborate version matching rules, you will need to
       write your own custom <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;ConfigVersion.cmake</b> file instead of using this macro.

       Added in version 3.11: The <b>SameMinorVersion</b> compatibility mode.

       Added in version 3.14: If <b>ARCH_INDEPENDENT</b> is given, the installed package  version  will  be  considered
       compatible even if it was built for a different architecture than the requested architecture.  Otherwise,
       an  architecture  check  will  be  performed,  and  the package will be considered compatible only if the
       architecture matches exactly.  For example, if the package  is  built  for  a  32-bit  architecture,  the
       package  is only considered compatible if it is used on a 32-bit architecture, unless <b>ARCH_INDEPENDENT</b> is
       given, in which case the package is considered compatible on any architecture.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          <b>ARCH_INDEPENDENT</b> is intended for header-only libraries or similar packages with no binaries.

       Added  in  version  3.19:  The  version  file  generated   by   <b>AnyNewerVersion</b>,   <b>SameMajorVersion</b>   and
       <b>SameMinorVersion</b>  arguments  of  <b>COMPATIBILITY</b>  handle  the  version  range,  if  one  is  specified (see
       <u>find_package()</u> command for the details).  <b>ExactVersion</b> mode is incompatible with version ranges and  will
       display an author warning if one is specified.

       Internally,  this macro executes <u>configure_file()</u> to create the resulting version file.  Depending on the
       <b>COMPATIBILITY</b>, the corresponding <b>BasicConfigVersion-&lt;COMPATIBILITY&gt;.cmake.in</b> file is used.   Please  note
       that  these  files  are  internal to CMake and you should not call <u>configure_file()</u> on them yourself, but
       they can be used as a starting point to create more sophisticated custom <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;ConfigVersion.cmake</b>
       files.

              of  <u>export(SETUP)</u>  to export packages in a way that a project built for any Apple platform can use
              them.

              <b>INSTALL_DESTINATION</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
                     Path to which the generated file will be installed by the caller, e.g., via <u>install(FILES)</u>.
                     The path may be either relative to the <b>INSTALL_PREFIX</b> or absolute.

              <b>INSTALL_PREFIX</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
                     Path prefix to which the package will be installed by the caller.  The <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> argument must
                     be an absolute path.  If this argument is not  passed,  the  <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>  variable
                     will be used instead.

              <b>WATCHOS_INCLUDE_FILE</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
                     File to include if the platform is watchOS.

              <b>WATCHOS_SIMULATOR_INCLUDE_FILE</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
                     File to include if the platform is watchOS Simulator.

              <b>VISIONOS_INCLUDE_FILE</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
                     File to include if the platform is visionOS.

                     File to include if the platform is visionOS Simulator.

              <b>ERROR_VARIABLE</b> <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b>
                     If  the  consuming project is built for an unsupported platform, set <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> to an error
                     message.  The includer may use this information to pretend the package was not  found.   If
                     this option is not given, the default behavior is to issue a fatal error.

              If  any of the optional include files is not specified, and the consuming project is built for its
              corresponding platform, the generated file will consider the  platform  to  be  unsupported.   The
              behavior is determined by the <b>ERROR_VARIABLE</b> option.

   <b>CMakePrintHelpers</b>
       Convenience functions for printing properties and variables, useful e.g. for debugging.

          cmake_print_properties(&lt;TARGETS       [&lt;target1&gt; ...] |
                                  SOURCES       [&lt;source1&gt; ...] |
                                  DIRECTORIES   [&lt;dir1&gt; ...]    |
                                  TESTS         [&lt;test1&gt; ...]   |
                                  CACHE_ENTRIES [&lt;entry1&gt; ...]  &gt;
                                 PROPERTIES [&lt;prop1&gt; ...]         )

       This function prints the values of the properties of the given targets, source files, directories,  tests
       or  cache  entries.  Exactly one of the scope keywords must be used.  The scope keyword and its arguments
       must come before the <b>PROPERTIES</b> keyword, in the arguments list.

       Example:

          cmake_print_properties(TARGETS foo bar PROPERTIES
                                 LOCATION INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES)

       This will print the LOCATION and INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES properties for both targets foo and bar.

          cmake_print_variables(var1 var2 ..  varN)

       This function will print the name of each variable followed by its value.  Example:

          cmake_print_variables(CMAKE_C_COMPILER CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION DOES_NOT_EXIST)

       Gives:

          -- CMAKE_C_COMPILER="/usr/bin/gcc" ; CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION="2" ; DOES_NOT_EXIST=""

   <b>CMakePrintSystemInformation</b>
       Print system information.

       This module serves diagnostic purposes. Just include it in  a  project  to  see  various  internal  CMake
       variables.

   <b>CMakePushCheckState</b>
       This    module    defines    three    macros:    <b>CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE()</b>   <b>CMAKE_POP_CHECK_STATE()</b>   and
       <b>CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE()</b> These macros can be used to save, restore and reset (i.e., clear contents)  the
       state  of  the  variables  <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</b>, <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS</b>, <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS</b>,
       <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES</b>,       <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_DIRECTORIES</b>,       <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</b>        and
       <b>CMAKE_EXTRA_INCLUDE_FILES</b>   used   by   the   various   Check-files   coming   with   CMake,   like  e.g.
       <b>check_function_exists()</b> etc.  The variable contents are pushed on a  stack,  pushing  multiple  times  is
       supported.   This  is useful e.g.  when executing such tests in a Find-module, where they have to be set,
       but after the Find-module has been executed they should have the same value as they had before.

       <b>CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE()</b>   macro   receives   optional   argument   <b>RESET</b>.    Whether   it's   specified,
       <b>CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE()</b>   will   set   all   <b>CMAKE_REQUIRED_*</b>   variables   to  empty  values,  same  as
       <b>CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE()</b> call will do.

       Usage:

          cmake_push_check_state(RESET)
          set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS -DSOME_MORE_DEF)
          check_function_exists(...)
          cmake_reset_check_state()
          set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS -DANOTHER_DEF)
          check_function_exists(...)
          cmake_pop_check_state()

   <b>CMakeVerifyManifest</b>
       CMakeVerifyManifest.cmake

       This script is used to verify that embedded manifests and side by side manifests for a project match.  To
       run this script, cd to a directory and run the script with cmake -P.  On the command line you can pass in
       versions  that  are  OK  even  if   not   found   in   the   .manifest   files.    For   example,   cmake
       -Dallow_versions=8.0.50608.0  -PCmakeVerifyManifest.cmake  could be used to allow an embedded manifest of
       8.0.50608.0 to be used in a project even if that version was not found in the .manifest file.

   <b>CPack</b>
       Configure generators for binary installers and source packages.

   <b>Introduction</b>
       The CPack module generates the configuration files <b>CPackConfig.cmake</b>  and  <b>CPackSourceConfig.cmake</b>.  They
       are  intended  for  use  in  a  subsequent  run  of  the <u>cpack</u> program where they steer the generation of
       installers or/and source packages.

       Depending on the CMake generator, the CPack module may also  add  two  new  build  targets,  <b>package</b>  and
       <b>package_source</b>. See the <u>packaging</u> <u>targets</u> section below for details.

       The  generated  binary  installers  will contain all files that have been installed via CMake's <u>install()</u>
       command (and the deprecated commands <u>install_files()</u>, <u>install_programs()</u>,  and  <u>install_targets()</u>).  Note
       that  the  <b>DESTINATION</b> option of the <u>install()</u> command must be a relative path; otherwise installed files
       are ignored by CPack.

       Certain kinds of binary installers can be configured such that users can  select  individual  application
       components to install.  See the <u>CPackComponent</u> module for further details.

       Source packages (configured through <b>CPackSourceConfig.cmake</b> and generated by the <u>CPack</u> <u>Archive</u> <u>Generator</u>)
       will    contain   all   source   files   in   the   project   directory   except   those   specified   in
       <u>CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES</u>.

   <b>CPack</b> <b>Generators</b>
       The <u>CPACK_GENERATOR</u> variable has different meanings in different contexts.   In  a  <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>  file,
       <u>CPACK_GENERATOR</u>  is  a <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>generators</u>: and when <u>cpack</u> is run with no other arguments, it will iterate
       over  that  list  and  produce  one  package  for  each  generator.   In   a   <u>CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE</u>,
       <u>CPACK_GENERATOR</u>  is a <u>string</u> <u>naming</u> <u>a</u> <u>single</u> <u>generator</u>.  If you need per-cpack-generator logic to control
       <u>other</u> cpack settings, then you need a <u>CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE</u>.  If set,  the  <u>CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE</u>
       is included automatically on a per-generator basis.  It only need contain overrides.

       Here's how it works:

       • <u>cpack</u> runs

       • it includes <b>CPackConfig.cmake</b>

       • it  iterates  over  the  generators  given  by  the  <u>-G</u>  command  line option, or if no such option was
         specified,  over  the  list  of  generators  given  by  the  <u>CPACK_GENERATOR</u>  variable   set   in   the
         <b>CPackConfig.cmake</b> input file.

       • foreach generator, it then

         • sets <u>CPACK_GENERATOR</u> to the one currently being iterated

         • includes the <u>CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE</u>

         • produces the package for that generator

       This  is  the  key:  For  each generator listed in <u>CPACK_GENERATOR</u> in <b>CPackConfig.cmake</b>, cpack will <u>reset</u>
       <u>CPACK_GENERATOR</u>   internally   to   <u>the</u>   <u>one</u>   <u>currently</u>   <u>being</u>   <u>used</u>    and    then    include    the
       <u>CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE</u>.

       For a list of available generators, see <u><a href="../man7/cpack-generators.7.html">cpack-generators</a>(7)</u>.

   <b>Targets</b> <b>package</b> <b>and</b> <b>package_source</b>
       If  CMake  is  run  with  the Makefile, Ninja, or Xcode generator, then <b>include(CPack)</b> generates a target
       <b>package</b>. This makes it possible to build a binary installer from CMake, Make, or Ninja: Instead of <b>cpack</b>,
       one may call <b>cmake</b> <b>--build</b> <b>.</b> <b>--target</b> <b>package</b> or <b>make</b> <b>package</b> or <b>ninja</b> <b>package</b>. The VS generator  creates
       an uppercase target <b>PACKAGE</b>.

       If  CMake  is  run  with  the  Makefile  or  Ninja generator, then <b>include(CPack)</b> also generates a target
       <b>package_source</b>. To build a source package, instead of <b>cpack</b> <b>-G</b> <b>TGZ</b> <b>--config</b>  <b>CPackSourceConfig.cmake</b>  one
       may call <b>cmake</b> <b>--build</b> <b>.</b> <b>--target</b> <b>package_source</b>, <b>make</b> <b>package_source</b>, or <b>ninja</b> <b>package_source</b>.

   <b>Variables</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>CPack</b> <b>Generators</b>
       Before including this CPack module in your <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file, there are a variety of variables that can
       be set to customize the resulting installers.  The most commonly-used variables are:

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME</b>
              The name of the package (or application).  If not specified, it defaults to the project name.

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR</b>
              The name of the package vendor. (e.g., "Kitware").  The default is "Humanity".

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY</b>
              The  directory  in  which  CPack  is doing its packaging.  If it is not set then this will default
              (internally) to the build dir.  This variable may be defined in a CPack config file  or  from  the
              <u>cpack</u>  command  line  option <b>-B</b>.  If set, the command line option overrides the value found in the
              config file.

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR</b>
              Package major version.  This variable will always be set, but its default value depends on whether
              or not version details were given to the <u>project()</u> command in the top level  CMakeLists.txt  file.
              If  version  details  were  given,  the  default value will be <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR</u>.  If no
              version  details  were  given,  a  default  version  of  0.1.1  will  be   assumed,   leading   to
              <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR</b> having a default value of 0.

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR</b>
              Package  minor  version.   The default value is determined based on whether or not version details
              were given to the <u>project()</u> command in the top level CMakeLists.txt file.  If version details were
              given, the default value will be <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR</u>, but if no  minor  version  component
              was  specified  then  <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR</b>  will  be left unset.  If no project version was
              given at all, a default version of 0.1.1 will be assumed, leading  to  <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR</b>
              having a default value of 1.

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH</b>
              Package  patch  version.   The default value is determined based on whether or not version details
              were given to the <u>project()</u> command in the top level CMakeLists.txt file.  If version details were
              given, the default value will be <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH</u>, but if no  patch  version  component
              was  specified  then  <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH</b>  will  be left unset.  If no project version was
              given at all, a default version of 0.1.1 will be assumed, leading  to  <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH</b>
              having a default value of 1.

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION</b>
              A  description  of  the project, used in places such as the introduction screen of CPack-generated
              Windows installers.  If not set, the value of this variable is populated from the  file  named  by
              <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE</u>.

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE</b>
              A  text  file  used  to describe the project when <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION</u> is not explicitly set.
              The  default  value  for  <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE</b>  points  to  a  built-in  template   file
              <b>Templates/CPack.GenericDescription.txt</b>.

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY</b>
              Short description of the project (only a few words).  If the <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION</u> variable is
              set,  it  is  used as the default value, otherwise the default will be a string generated by CMake
              based on <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME</u>.

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_HOMEPAGE_URL</b>
              Project homepage URL.  The default value is taken from  the  <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL</u>  variable,
              which  is  set by the top level <u>project()</u> command, or else the default will be empty if no URL was
              provided to <u>project()</u>.

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME</b>
              The  name  of  the  package  file  to  generate,  not  including  the  extension.   For   example,
              <b>cmake-2.6.1-Linux-i686</b>.  The default value is:

                 ${CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME}-${CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION}-${CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME}

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY</b>
              Installation  directory  on the target system. This may be used by some CPack generators like NSIS
              to create an installation  directory  e.g.,  "CMake  2.5"  below  the  installation  prefix.   All
              installed elements will be put inside this directory.

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON</b>
              A branding image that will be displayed inside the installer (used by GUI installers).

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_CHECKSUM</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              An  algorithm  that  will be used to generate an additional file with the checksum of the package.
              The output file name will be:

                 ${CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME}.${CPACK_PACKAGE_CHECKSUM}

              Supported algorithms are those listed by the <u>string(&lt;HASH&gt;)</u> command.

       <b>CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE</b>
              CPack-time project CPack configuration file.  This file  is  included  at  cpack  time,  once  per
              generator  after  CPack  has  set  <u>CPACK_GENERATOR</u>  to the actual generator being used.  It allows
              per-generator setting of <b>CPACK_*</b> variables at cpack time.

       <b>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE</b>
              License to be embedded in the installer.  It will typically  be  displayed  to  the  user  by  the
              produced  installer  (often  with  an explicit "Accept" button, for graphical installers) prior to
              installation.  This license file is NOT added to the installed files but is  used  by  some  CPack
              generators  like NSIS.  If you want to use UTF-8 characters, the file needs to be encoded in UTF-8
              BOM.  If you want to install a license file (may be the same as this one) along with your project,
              you must add an appropriate CMake <u>install()</u> command in your <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>.

       <b>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README</b>
              ReadMe file to be embedded in the installer.  It typically describes in some detail the purpose of
              the project during the installation.  Not all CPack generators use this file.

       <b>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME</b>
              Welcome file to be embedded in the installer.  It welcomes users  to  this  installer.   Typically
              used in the graphical installers on Windows and Mac OS X.

       <b>CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL</b>
              Disables  the  component-based  installation  mechanism.  When set, the component specification is
              ignored and all installed items are put in a single "MONOLITHIC" package.  Some  CPack  generators
              do  monolithic  packaging  by  default  and  may  be  asked  to  do component packaging by setting
              <b>CPACK_&lt;GENNAME&gt;_COMPONENT_INSTALL</b> to <b>TRUE</b>.

       <b>CPACK_GENERATOR</b>
              List of CPack generators to use.  If not specified, CPack will create a set of  options  following
              the   naming   pattern  <u>CPACK_BINARY_&lt;GENNAME&gt;</u>  (e.g.  <b>CPACK_BINARY_NSIS</b>)  allowing  the  user  to
              enable/disable individual generators.  If the <u>-G</u> option is given on the  <u>cpack</u>  command  line,  it
              will override this variable and any <b>CPACK_BINARY_&lt;GENNAME&gt;</b> options.

       <b>CPACK_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE</b>
              The  name  of the CPack binary configuration file.  This file is the CPack configuration generated
              by the CPack module for binary installers.  Defaults to <b>CPackConfig.cmake</b>.

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES</b>
              Lists each of the executables and associated text label to be used to create Start Menu shortcuts.
              For example, setting this to the list <b>ccmake;CMake</b> will create a shortcut named "CMake" that  will
              execute  the  installed  executable  <b>ccmake</b>.  Not all CPack generators use it (at least NSIS, Inno
              Setup and WIX do).

       <b>CPACK_STRIP_FILES</b>
              List of files to be stripped.  Starting with CMake 2.6.0,  <b>CPACK_STRIP_FILES</b>  will  be  a  boolean
              variable which enables stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to <b>TRUE</b> in CMake, so this
              change is compatible).

       <b>CPACK_VERBATIM_VARIABLES</b>
              Added in version 3.4.

              If  set  to <b>TRUE</b>, values of variables prefixed with <b>CPACK_</b> will be escaped before being written to
              the configuration files, so that the cpack program receives them exactly as they  were  specified.
              If  not,  characters  like  quotes  and  backslashes  can  cause parsing errors or alter the value
              received by the cpack program.  Defaults to <b>FALSE</b> for backwards compatibility.

       <b>CPACK_THREADS</b>
              Added in version 3.20.

              Number of threads to  use  when  performing  parallelized  operations,  such  as  compressing  the
              installer package.

              Some  compression methods used by CPack generators such as Debian or Archive may take advantage of
              multiple CPU cores to speed up compression.  <b>CPACK_THREADS</b> can be set to specify how many  threads
              will be used for compression.

              A positive integer can be used to specify an exact desired thread count.

              When  given a negative integer CPack will use the absolute value as the upper limit but may choose
              a lower value based on the available hardware concurrency.

              Given 0 CPack will try to use all available CPU cores.

              By default <b>CPACK_THREADS</b> is set to <b>1</b>.

              The following compression methods may take advantage of multiple cores:

              <b>xz</b>     Supported if CMake is built with a <b>liblzma</b> that supports parallel compression.

                     Added in version 3.21: Official CMake binaries available  on  <b>cmake.org</b>  now  ship  with  a
                     <b>liblzma</b> that supports parallel compression.  Older versions did not.

              <b>zstd</b>   Added in version 3.24.

                     Supported  if  CMake  is  built  with  libarchive  3.6  or higher.  Official CMake binaries
                     available on <b>cmake.org</b> support it.

              Other compression methods ignore this value and use only one thread.

   <b>Variables</b> <b>for</b> <b>Source</b> <b>Package</b> <b>Generators</b>
       The following CPack variables are specific to source packages, and will not affect binary packages:

       <b>CPACK_SOURCE_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME</b>
              The name of the source package.  For example <b>cmake-2.6.1</b>.

       <b>CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES</b>
              List  of  files  in  the  source  tree  that  will  be  stripped.   Starting  with  CMake   2.6.0,
              <b>CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES</b>  will  be a boolean variable which enables stripping of all files (a list
              of files evaluates to <b>TRUE</b> in CMake, so this change is compatible).

       <b>CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR</b>
              List of generators used for the  source  packages.   As  with  <u>CPACK_GENERATOR</u>,  if  this  is  not
              specified then CPack will create a set of options (e.g. <b>CPACK_SOURCE_ZIP</b>) allowing users to select
              which packages will be generated.

       <b>CPACK_SOURCE_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE</b>
              The  name  of the CPack source configuration file.  This file is the CPack configuration generated
              by the CPack module for source installers.  Defaults to <b>CPackSourceConfig.cmake</b>.

       <b>CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES</b>
              Pattern of files in the source tree that won't be packaged when building a source  package.   This
              is   a   list   of   regular   expression   patterns   (that  must  be  properly  escaped),  e.g.,
              <b>/CVS/;/\\.svn/;\\.swp$;\\.#;/#;.*~;cscope.*</b>

   <b>Variables</b> <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Use</b>
       The following variables are for advanced uses of CPack:

       <b>CPACK_CMAKE_GENERATOR</b>
              What CMake generator should be used if the project is a CMake project.  Defaults to the  value  of
              <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR</u>.  Few users will want to change this setting.

       <b>CPACK_INSTALL_CMAKE_PROJECTS</b>
              List  of  four values that specify what project to install.  The four values are: Build directory,
              Project Name, Project Component, Directory.  If  omitted,  CPack  will  build  an  installer  that
              installs everything.

       <b>CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME</b>
              System  name, defaults to the value of <u>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</u>, except on Windows where it will be <b>win32</b>
              or <b>win64</b>.

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION</b>
              Package   full   version,    used    internally.     By    default,    this    is    built    from
              <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR</u>, <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR</u>, and <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH</u>.

       <b>CPACK_TOPLEVEL_TAG</b>
              Directory for the installed files.

       <b>CPACK_INSTALL_COMMANDS</b>
              Extra commands to install components.  The environment variable <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b> is set to the
              temporary install directory during execution.

       <b>CPACK_INSTALL_SCRIPTS</b>
              Added in version 3.16.

              Extra  CMake  scripts  executed by CPack during its local staging installation.  They are executed
              before installing the files to be packaged.  The scripts are not called by  a  standalone  install
              (e.g.:   <b>make</b>   <b>install</b>).    For   every   script,   the   following   variables   will   be  set:
              <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>, <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u> and <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> (which is set  to  the
              staging install directory).  The singular form <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_SCRIPT</b> is supported as an alternative
              variable  for  historical  reasons, but its value is ignored if <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_SCRIPTS</b> is set and a
              warning will be issued.

              See also <u>CPACK_PRE_BUILD_SCRIPTS</u> and <u>CPACK_POST_BUILD_SCRIPTS</u> which can be used to specify scripts
              to be executed later in the packaging process.

       <b>CPACK_PRE_BUILD_SCRIPTS</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              List of CMake scripts to execute after CPack has installed the files to be packaged into a staging
              directory and before producing the package(s) from those files. See also <u>CPACK_INSTALL_SCRIPTS</u> and
              <u>CPACK_POST_BUILD_SCRIPTS</u>.

       <b>CPACK_POST_BUILD_SCRIPTS</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              List of CMake scripts to execute after CPack  has  produced  the  resultant  packages  and  before
              copying them back to the build directory.  See also <u>CPACK_INSTALL_SCRIPTS</u>, <u>CPACK_PRE_BUILD_SCRIPTS</u>
              and <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_FILES</u>.

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_FILES</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              List of package files created in the staging directory, with each file provided as a full absolute
              path.   This  variable is populated by CPack just before invoking the post-build scripts listed in
              <u>CPACK_POST_BUILD_SCRIPTS</u>.  It is the preferred way for the post-build scripts to know the  set  of
              package files to operate on.  Projects should not try to set this variable themselves.

       <b>CPACK_INSTALLED_DIRECTORIES</b>
              Extra directories to install.

       <b>CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_REGISTRY_KEY</b>
              Registry key used when installing this project.  This is only used by installers for Windows.  The
              default value is based on the installation directory.

       <b>CPACK_CREATE_DESKTOP_LINKS</b>
              List  of  desktop links to create.  Each desktop link requires a corresponding start menu shortcut
              as created by <u>CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES</u>.

       <b>CPACK_BINARY_&lt;GENNAME&gt;</b>
              CPack  generated  options  for  binary  generators.   The  <b>CPack.cmake</b>  module   generates   (when
              <u>CPACK_GENERATOR</u>  is not set) a set of CMake options (see CMake <u>option()</u> command) which may then be
              used to select the CPack generator(s) to be used when building the <b>package</b> target or when  running
              <u>cpack</u> without the <u>-G</u> option.

       <b>CPACK_READELF_EXECUTABLE</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              Specify  the  <b>readelf</b>  executable  path  used  by CPack.  The default value will be taken from the
              <b>CMAKE_READELF</b> variable, if  set,  which  may  be  populated  by  an  internal  CMake  module.   If
              <b>CMAKE_READELF</b> is not set, CPack will use <u>find_program()</u> to determine the <b>readelf</b> path when needed.

       <b>CPACK_OBJCOPY_EXECUTABLE</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              Specify  the  <b>objcopy</b>  executable  path  used  by CPack.  The default value will be taken from the
              <b>CMAKE_OBJCOPY</b> variable, if  set,  which  may  be  populated  by  an  internal  CMake  module.   If
              <b>CMAKE_OBJCOPY</b> is not set, CPack will use <u>find_program()</u> to determine the <b>objcopy</b> path when needed.

       <b>CPACK_OBJDUMP_EXECUTABLE</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              Specify  the  <b>objdump</b>  executable  path  used  by CPack.  The default value will be taken from the
              <b>CMAKE_OBJDUMP</b> variable, if  set,  which  may  be  populated  by  an  internal  CMake  module.   If
              <b>CMAKE_OBJDUMP</b> is not set, CPack will use <u>find_program()</u> to determine the <b>objdump</b> path when needed.

   <b>CPackComponent</b>
       Configure components for binary installers and source packages.

   <b>Introduction</b>
       This module is automatically included by <u>CPack</u>.

       Certain  binary installers (especially the graphical installers) generated by CPack allow users to select
       individual application <u>components</u> to install.  This module allows developers to configure  the  packaging
       of such components.

       Contents  is  assigned  to components by the <b>COMPONENT</b> argument of CMake's <u>install()</u> command.  Components
       can be annotated with user-friendly names  and  descriptions,  inter-component  dependencies,  etc.,  and
       grouped in various ways to customize the resulting installer, using the commands described below.

       To specify different groupings for different CPack generators use a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.

   <b>Variables</b>
       The following variables influence the component-specific packaging:

       <b>CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL</b>
              The list of component to install.

              The default value of this variable is computed by CPack and contains all components defined by the
              project.  The user may set it to only include the specified components.

              Instead  of  specifying all the desired components, it is possible to obtain a list of all defined
              components and then remove the unwanted ones from the list. The <u>get_cmake_property()</u>  command  can
              be  used  to  obtain  the  <b>COMPONENTS</b>  property, then the <u>list(REMOVE_ITEM)</u> command can be used to
              remove the unwanted ones. For example, to use all defined components except <b>foo</b> and <b>bar</b>:

                 get_cmake_property(CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL COMPONENTS)
                 list(REMOVE_ITEM CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL "foo" "bar")

       <b>CPACK_&lt;GENNAME&gt;_COMPONENT_INSTALL</b>
              Enable/Disable component install for CPack generator &lt;GENNAME&gt;.

              Each CPack Generator (RPM, DEB, ARCHIVE, NSIS, DMG, etc...) has a legacy default  behavior.   e.g.
              RPM  builds  monolithic  whereas  NSIS  builds  component.  One can change the default behavior by
              setting this variable to 0/1 or OFF/ON.

       <b>CPACK_COMPONENTS_GROUPING</b>
              Specify how components are grouped for multi-package component-aware CPack generators.

              Some generators like RPM or ARCHIVE (TGZ, ZIP, ...) may generate several packages files when there
              are components, depending on the value of this variable:

              • ONE_PER_GROUP (default): create one package per component group

              • IGNORE : create one package per component (ignore the groups)

              • ALL_COMPONENTS_IN_ONE : create a single package with all requested components

       <b>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DISPLAY_NAME</b>
              The name to be displayed for a component.

       <b>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DESCRIPTION</b>
              The description of a component.

       <b>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_GROUP</b>
              The group of a component.

       <b>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DEPENDS</b>
              The dependencies (list of components) on which this component depends.

       <b>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_HIDDEN</b>
              True if this component is hidden from the user.

       <b>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_REQUIRED</b>
              True if this component is required.

       <b>compname</b> is the name of an installation component, as defined by the <b>COMPONENT</b> argument of  one  or  more
       CMake  <u>install()</u>  commands.   With the <b>cpack_add_component</b> command one can set a name, a description, and
       other attributes of an installation component.  One can also assign a component to a component group.

       DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of  the  component,  used  in  graphical  installers  to  display  the
       component name.  This value can be any string.

       DESCRIPTION  is  an  extended description of the component, used in graphical installers to give the user
       additional information about the component.  Descriptions can span multiple lines using <b>\n</b>  as  the  line
       separator.  Typically, these descriptions should be no more than a few lines long.

       HIDDEN  indicates  that this component will be hidden in the graphical installer, so that the user cannot
       directly change whether it is installed or not.

       REQUIRED indicates that this component is required, and therefore will always be installed.  It  will  be
       visible  in  the  graphical  installer, but it cannot be unselected.  (Typically, required components are
       shown grayed out).

       DISABLED indicates that this component should be disabled (unselected) by default.  The user is  free  to
       select this component for installation, unless it is also HIDDEN.

       DEPENDS  lists  the components on which this component depends.  If this component is selected, then each
       of the components listed must also be  selected.   The  dependency  information  is  encoded  within  the
       installer itself, so that users cannot install inconsistent sets of components.

       GROUP  names  the component group of which this component is a part.  If not provided, the component will
       be a standalone component, not part of any component group.  Component  groups  are  described  with  the
       cpack_add_component_group command, detailed below.

       INSTALL_TYPES  lists  the  installation  types  of  which  this  component  is a part.  When one of these
       installations types is selected, this component will automatically be selected.  Installation  types  are
       described with the cpack_add_install_type command, detailed below.

       DOWNLOADED  indicates  that  this component should be downloaded on-the-fly by the installer, rather than
       packaged in with the installer itself.  For more information, see the cpack_configure_downloads command.

       ARCHIVE_FILE provides a name for the archive file created by CPack to be used for downloaded  components.
       If not supplied, CPack will create a file with some name based on CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME and the name of
       the component.  See cpack_configure_downloads for more information.

       PLIST  gives  a  filename  that  is passed to pkgbuild with the <b>--component-plist</b> argument when using the
       productbuild generator.

   <b>Add</b> <b>component</b> <b>group</b>
       <b>cpack_add_component_group</b>

       Describes a group of related CPack installation components.

          cpack_add_component_group(groupname
                                   [DISPLAY_NAME name]
                                   [DESCRIPTION description]
                                   [PARENT_GROUP parent]
                                   [EXPANDED]
                                   [BOLD_TITLE])

       The cpack_add_component_group describes a group of installation components, which will be placed together
       within the listing of options.  Typically, component groups allow the user to select/deselect all of  the
       components  within  a  single  group via a single group-level option.  Use component groups to reduce the
       complexity of installers with many options.  groupname is an arbitrary name used to identify the group in
       the GROUP argument of the cpack_add_component command, which is used to place a  component  in  a  group.
       The name of the group must not conflict with the name of any component.

       DISPLAY_NAME  is  the  displayed name of the component group, used in graphical installers to display the
       component group name.  This value can be any string.

       DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component group, used in graphical installers to  give  the
       user additional information about the components within that group.  Descriptions can span multiple lines
       using <b>\n</b> as the line separator.  Typically, these descriptions should be no more than a few lines long.

       PARENT_GROUP,  if  supplied, names the parent group of this group.  Parent groups are used to establish a
       hierarchy of groups, providing an arbitrary hierarchy of groups.

       EXPANDED indicates that, by default, the group should show up as "expanded", so that the user immediately
       sees all of the components within the group.  Otherwise, the group will initially show  up  as  a  single
       entry.

       BOLD_TITLE  indicates  that  the  group  title should appear in bold, to call the user's attention to the
       group.

   <b>Add</b> <b>installation</b> <b>type</b>
       <b>cpack_add_install_type</b>

       Add a new installation type containing  a  set  of  predefined  component  selections  to  the  graphical
       installer.

          cpack_add_install_type(typename
                                 [DISPLAY_NAME name])

       The  cpack_add_install_type  command  identifies a set of preselected components that represents a common
       use case for an application.  For example, a "Developer" install type might include an application  along
       with  its header and library files, while an "End user" install type might just include the application's
       executable.  Each component identifies itself with one  or  more  install  types  via  the  INSTALL_TYPES
       argument to cpack_add_component.

       DISPLAY_NAME  is  the displayed name of the install type, which will typically show up in a drop-down box
       within a graphical installer.  This value can be any string.

   <b>Configure</b> <b>downloads</b>
       <b>cpack_configure_downloads</b>

       Configure CPack to download selected components on-the-fly as part of the installation process.

          cpack_configure_downloads(site
                                    [UPLOAD_DIRECTORY dirname]
                                    [ALL]
                                    [ADD_REMOVE|NO_ADD_REMOVE])

       The cpack_configure_downloads command configures installation-time downloads of selected components.  For
       each downloadable component, CPack will create an archive containing  the  contents  of  that  component,
       which  should  be uploaded to the given site.  When the user selects that component for installation, the
       installer will download and extract the component in place.  This feature is useful  for  creating  small
       installers  that  only download the requested components, saving bandwidth.  Additionally, the installers
       are small enough that they will be installed as part of the normal installation process, and the "Change"
       button in Windows Add/Remove Programs control panel will  allow  one  to  add  or  remove  parts  of  the
       application  after  the  original  installation.   On  Windows,  the  downloaded-components functionality
       requires the ZipDLL plug-in for NSIS, available at:

          <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL_plug-in">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL_plug-in</a>

       On macOS, installers that download components on-the-fly can only be built and installed on system  using
       macOS 10.5 or later.

       The  site  argument  is  a  URL  where  the  archives  for  downloadable  components will reside, e.g., ‐
       <u>https://cmake.org/files/v3.25/</u> All of the archives produced by CPack should be uploaded to that location.

       UPLOAD_DIRECTORY is the local directory where CPack will create the various  archives  for  each  of  the
       components.   The contents of this directory should be uploaded to a location accessible by the URL given
       in the site argument.  If omitted, CPack will use the directory  CPackUploads  inside  the  CMake  binary
       directory to store the generated archives.

       The  ALL  flag  indicates that all components be downloaded.  Otherwise, only those components explicitly
       marked as DOWNLOADED or that have a specified ARCHIVE_FILE will be  downloaded.   Additionally,  the  ALL
       option implies ADD_REMOVE (unless NO_ADD_REMOVE is specified).

       ADD_REMOVE  indicates  that CPack should install a copy of the installer that can be called from Windows'
       Add/Remove Programs dialog (via  the  "Modify"  button)  to  change  the  set  of  installed  components.
       NO_ADD_REMOVE turns off this behavior.  This option is ignored on Mac OS X.

   <b>CPackIFW</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       This module looks for the location of the command-line utilities supplied with the <u>Qt</u> <u>Installer</u> <u>Framework</u>

                     Added in version 3.8.

                     if set, then the component will be hidden from the installer.  It is a  equivalent  of  the
                     <b>HIDDEN</b> option from the <u>cpack_add_component()</u> command.

              <b>FORCED_INSTALLATION</b>
                     Added in version 3.8.

                     if  set,  then  the component must always be installed.  It is a equivalent of the <b>REQUIRED</b>
                     option from the <u>cpack_add_component()</u> command.

                 cpack_ifw_add_package_resources(&lt;file_path&gt; &lt;file_path&gt; ...)

              This command will also add the specified files to a variable <u>CPACK_IFW_PACKAGE_RESOURCES</u>.

   <b>CPackIFWConfigureFile</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       The   module   defines   <u>configure_file()</u>  similar  command  to  configure  file  templates  prepared  in
       QtIFW/SDK/Creator style.

   <b>Commands</b>
       The module defines the following commands:

       <b>cpack_ifw_configure_file</b>
              Copy a file to another location and modify its contents.

                 cpack_ifw_configure_file(&lt;input&gt; &lt;output&gt;)

              <b>%VAR%</b> in the input file content.  Each variable reference will be replaced with the current  value
              of the variable, or the empty string if the variable is not defined.

   <b>CSharpUtilities</b>
       Added in version 3.8.

       Functions to make configuration of CSharp/.NET targets easier.

       A  collection  of  CMake  utility  functions  useful  for  dealing  with CSharp targets for Visual Studio
       generators from version 2010 and later.

       The following functions are provided by this module:

       <b>Main</b> <b>functions</b>

       • <u>csharp_set_windows_forms_properties()</u>

       • <u>csharp_set_designer_cs_properties()</u>

       • <u>csharp_set_xaml_cs_properties()</u>

       <b>Helper</b> <b>functions</b>

       • <u>csharp_get_filename_keys()</u>

       • <u>csharp_get_filename_key_base()</u>

       • <u>csharp_get_dependentupon_name()</u>

   <b>Main</b> <b>functions</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>module</b>
       <b>csharp_set_windows_forms_properties</b>
              Sets source file properties for use of Windows Forms. Use this, if your CSharp target uses Windows
              Forms:

                 csharp_set_windows_forms_properties([&lt;file1&gt; [&lt;file2&gt; [...]]])

              <b>&lt;fileN&gt;</b>
                     List of all source files which are relevant for setting the <u>VS_CSHARP_&lt;tagname&gt;</u>  properties
                     (including <b>.cs</b>, <b>.resx</b> and <b>.Designer.cs</b> extensions).

              In  the list of all given files for all files ending with <b>.Designer.cs</b> and <b>.resx</b> is searched.  For
              every <u>designer</u> or <u>resource</u> file a file with the same base  name  but  only  <b>.cs</b>  as  extension  is
              searched.  If this is found, the <u>VS_CSHARP_&lt;tagname&gt;</u> properties are set as follows:

              for the <b>.cs</b> file:

                     • VS_CSHARP_SubType "Form"

              for the <b>.Designer.cs</b> file (if it exists):

                     • VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon &lt;cs-filename&gt;

                     • VS_CSHARP_DesignTime "" (delete tag if previously defined)

                     • VS_CSHARP_AutoGen ""(delete tag if previously defined)

              for the <b>.resx</b> file (if it exists):

                     • VS_RESOURCE_GENERATOR "" (delete tag if previously defined)

                     • VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon &lt;cs-filename&gt;

                     • VS_CSHARP_SubType "Designer"

       <b>csharp_set_designer_cs_properties</b>
              Sets  source  file  properties  of <b>.Designer.cs</b> files depending on sibling filenames. Use this, if
              your   CSharp   target   does    <b>not</b>    use    Windows    Forms    (for    Windows    Forms    use
              <u>csharp_set_windows_forms_properties()</u> instead):

                 csharp_set_designer_cs_properties([&lt;file1&gt; [&lt;file2&gt; [...]]])

              <b>&lt;fileN&gt;</b>
                     List  of all source files which are relevant for setting the <u>VS_CSHARP_&lt;tagname&gt;</u> properties
                     (including <b>.cs</b>, <b>.resx</b>, <b>.settings</b> and <b>.Designer.cs</b> extensions).

              In the list of all given files for all files ending  with  <b>.Designer.cs</b>  is  searched.  For  every
              <u>designer</u>  file all files with the same base name but different extensions are searched. If a match
              is found, the source file properties of the <u>designer</u> file are set depending on  the  extension  of
              the matched file:

              if match is <b>.resx</b> file:

                     • VS_CSHARP_AutoGen "True"

                     • VS_CSHARP_DesignTime "True"

                     • VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon &lt;resx-filename&gt;

              if match is <b>.cs</b> file:

                     • VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon &lt;cs-filename&gt;

              if match is <b>.settings</b> file:

                     • VS_CSHARP_AutoGen "True"

                     • VS_CSHARP_DesignTimeSharedInput "True"

                     • VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon &lt;settings-filename&gt;

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Because the source file properties of the <b>.Designer.cs</b> file are set according to the found matches and
          every  match  sets  the  <b>VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon</b>  property,  there  should  only be one match for each
          <b>Designer.cs</b> file.

       <b>csharp_set_xaml_cs_properties</b>
              Sets source file properties for use of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and XAML.  Use  this,
              if your CSharp target uses WPF/XAML:

                 csharp_set_xaml_cs_properties([&lt;file1&gt; [&lt;file2&gt; [...]]])

              <b>&lt;fileN&gt;</b>
                     List  of all source files which are relevant for setting the <u>VS_CSHARP_&lt;tagname&gt;</u> properties
                     (including <b>.cs</b>, <b>.xaml</b>, and <b>.xaml.cs</b> extensions).

              In the list of all given files for all files ending with <b>.xaml.cs</b> is searched. For  every  <u>xaml-cs</u>
              file,  a  file  with the same base name but extension <b>.xaml</b> is searched.  If a match is found, the
              source file properties of the <b>.xaml.cs</b> file are set:

                 • VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon &lt;xaml-filename&gt;

   <b>Helper</b> <b>functions</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> <b>ones</b>
       <b>csharp_get_filename_keys</b>
              Helper function which computes a list of key values to  identify  source  files  independently  of
              relative/absolute paths given in cmake and eliminates case sensitivity:

                 csharp_get_filename_keys(OUT [&lt;file1&gt; [&lt;file2&gt; [...]]])

              <b>OUT</b>    Name of the variable in which the list of keys is stored

              <b>&lt;fileN&gt;</b>
                     filename(s) as given to CSharp target using <u>add_library()</u> or <u>add_executable()</u>

              In  some  way  the  function applies a canonicalization to the source names.  This is necessary to
              find file matches if the files have been added to the target with different directory prefixes:

                 add_library(lib
                   myfile.cs
                   ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/myfile.Designer.cs)

                 set_source_files_properties(myfile.Designer.cs PROPERTIES
                   VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon myfile.cs)

                 # this will fail, because in cmake
                 #  - ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/myfile.Designer.cs
                 #  - myfile.Designer.cs
                 # are not the same source file. The source file property is not set.

       <b>csharp_get_filename_key_base</b>
              Returns the full filepath and name <b>without</b> extension of a key.  KEY is expected to be a  key  from
              csharp_get_filename_keys. In BASE the value of KEY without the file extension is returned:

                 csharp_get_filename_key_base(BASE KEY)

              <b>BASE</b>   Name of the variable with the computed "base" of <b>KEY</b>.

              <b>KEY</b>    The key of which the base will be computed. Expected to be a upper case full filename.

       <b>csharp_get_dependentupon_name</b>
              Computes a string which can be used as value for the source file property <u>VS_CSHARP_&lt;tagname&gt;</u> with
              <u>target</u> being <b>DependentUpon</b>:

                 csharp_get_dependentupon_name(NAME FILE)

              <b>NAME</b>   Name of the variable with the result value

              <b>FILE</b>   Filename to convert to <b>&lt;DependentUpon&gt;</b> value

              Actually this is only the filename without any path given at the moment.

   <b>CTest</b>
       Configure a project for testing with CTest/CDash

       Include  this  module  in  the  top  CMakeLists.txt  file  of  a project to enable testing with CTest and
       dashboard submissions to CDash:

          project(MyProject)
          ...
          include(CTest)

       The module automatically creates a <b>BUILD_TESTING</b> option that selects whether to  enable  testing  support
       (<b>ON</b> by default).  After including the module, use code like:

          if(BUILD_TESTING)
            # ... CMake code to create tests ...
          endif()

       to creating tests when testing is enabled.

       To  enable  submissions to a CDash server, create a <b>CTestConfig.cmake</b> file at the top of the project with
       content such as:

          set(CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME "01:00:00 UTC")
          set(CTEST_SUBMIT_URL "<a href="http://my.cdash.org/submit.php">http://my.cdash.org/submit.php</a>?project=MyProject")

       (the CDash server can provide the file to a project administrator who configures <b>MyProject</b>).  Settings in
       the config file are shared by both this <b>CTest</b> module and the <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u> command-line <u>Dashboard</u> <u>Client</u>  mode
       (<u>ctest</u> <u>-S</u>).

       While  building  a  project for submission to CDash, CTest scans the build output for errors and warnings
       and reports them with surrounding context from the build log.  This generic approach works for all  build
       tools, but does not give details about the command invocation that produced a given problem.  One may get
       more detailed reports by setting the <u>CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS</u> variable:

          set(CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS 1)

       in the <b>CTestConfig.cmake</b> file.

   <b>CTestCoverageCollectGCOV</b>
       Added in version 3.2.

       This module provides the <b>ctest_coverage_collect_gcov</b> function.

       This  function  runs  gcov  on  all .gcda files found in the binary tree and packages the resulting .gcov
       files into a tar file.  This tarball also contains the following:

       • <u>data.json</u> defines the source and build directories for use by CDash.

       • <u>Labels.json</u> indicates any <u>LABELS</u> that have been set on the source files.

       • The <u>uncovered</u> directory holds any uncovered files found by <u>CTEST_EXTRA_COVERAGE_GLOB</u>.

       After generating this tar file, it can be sent to CDash for display with  the  <u>ctest_submit(CDASH_UPLOAD)</u>
       command.

       <b>ctest_coverage_collect_gcov</b>

                 ctest_coverage_collect_gcov(TARBALL &lt;tarfile&gt;
                   [SOURCE &lt;source_dir&gt;][BUILD &lt;build_dir&gt;]
                   [GCOV_COMMAND &lt;gcov_command&gt;]
                   [GCOV_OPTIONS &lt;options&gt;...]
                   )

              Run gcov and package a tar file for CDash.  The options are:

              <b>TARBALL</b> <b>&lt;tarfile&gt;</b>
                     Specify  the  location  of the <b>.tar</b> file to be created for later upload to CDash.  Relative
                     paths will be interpreted with respect to the top-level build directory.

              <b>TARBALL_COMPRESSION</b> <b>&lt;option&gt;</b>
                     Added in version 3.18.

                     Specify a compression algorithm for the <b>TARBALL</b> data file.  Using this option  reduces  the
                     size  of  the  data  file  before  it is submitted to CDash.  <b>&lt;option&gt;</b> must be one of <b>GZIP</b>,
                     <b>BZIP2</b>, <b>XZ</b>, <b>ZSTD</b>, <b>FROM_EXT</b>, or an expression that CMake  evaluates  as  <b>FALSE</b>.  The  default
                     value is <b>BZIP2</b>.

                     If <b>FROM_EXT</b> is specified, the resulting file will be compressed based on the file extension
                     of  the  <b>&lt;tarfile&gt;</b>  (i.e.  <b>.tar.gz</b>  will  use  <b>GZIP</b> compression). File extensions that will
                     produce compressed output include <b>.tar.gz</b>, <b>.tgz</b>, <b>.tar.bzip2</b>, <b>.tbz</b>, <b>.tar.xz</b>, and <b>.txz</b>.

              <b>SOURCE</b> <b>&lt;source_dir&gt;</b>
                     Specify  the  top-level  source  directory  for  the  build.   Default  is  the  value   of
                     <u>CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY</u>.

              <b>BUILD</b> <b>&lt;build_dir&gt;</b>
                     Specify   the   top-level  build  directory  for  the  build.   Default  is  the  value  of
                     <u>CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY</u>.

              <b>GCOV_COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;gcov_command&gt;</b>
                     Specify the full path to the <b>gcov</b>  command  on  the  machine.   Default  is  the  value  of
                     <u>CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND</u>.

              <b>GCOV_OPTIONS</b> <b>&lt;options&gt;...</b>
                     Specify  options  to  be  passed  to gcov.  The <b>gcov</b> command is run as <b>gcov</b> <b>&lt;options&gt;...</b> <b>-o</b>
                     <b>&lt;gcov-dir&gt;</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;.gcda</b>.  If not specified, the default option is just <b>-b</b> <b>-x</b>.

              <b>GLOB</b>   Added in version 3.6.

                     Recursively search for .gcda files in build_dir rather than determining search locations by
                     reading TargetDirectories.txt.

              <b>DELETE</b> Added in version 3.6.

                     Delete coverage files after they've been packaged into the .tar.

              <b>QUIET</b>  Suppress non-error messages that otherwise would have been printed out by this function.

              Added in version 3.3: Added support for the <u>CTEST_CUSTOM_COVERAGE_EXCLUDE</u> variable.

   <b>CTestScriptMode</b>
       This file is read by ctest in script mode (-S)

   <b>CTestUseLaunchers</b>
       Set the RULE_LAUNCH_* global properties when CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is on.

       CTestUseLaunchers is automatically included when you include(CTest).  However, it is split out  into  its
       own module file so projects can use the CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS functionality independently.

       To  use  launchers, set CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS to ON in a <u>ctest</u> <u>-S</u> dashboard script, and then also set it in
       the cache of the configured project.  Both cmake and ctest need to know the value of it for the launchers
       to work properly.  CMake needs to know in order to generate proper build rules, and ctest,  in  order  to
       produce the proper error and warning analysis.

       For  convenience,  you may set the ENV variable CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS_DEFAULT in your ctest -S script, too.
       Then, as long as your CMakeLists uses include(CTest) or include(CTestUseLaunchers), it will use the value
       of  the  ENV  variable  to  initialize  a  CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS  cache  variable.   This  cache   variable
       initialization only occurs if CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is not already defined.

       Added  in version 3.8: If CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is on in a <u>ctest</u> <u>-S</u> script the ctest_configure command will
       add -DCTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS:BOOL=TRUE to the cmake command used to configure the project.

   <b>DeployQt4</b>
       Functions to help assemble a standalone Qt4 executable.

       A collection of CMake utility functions useful for deploying Qt4 executables.

       The following functions are provided by this module:

          write_qt4_conf
          resolve_qt4_paths
          fixup_qt4_executable
          install_qt4_plugin_path
          install_qt4_plugin
          install_qt4_executable

       Requires  CMake  2.6  or  greater  because  it  uses  function  and  PARENT_SCOPE.    Also   depends   on
       BundleUtilities.cmake.

          write_qt4_conf(&lt;qt_conf_dir&gt; &lt;qt_conf_contents&gt;)

       Writes a qt.conf file with the &lt;qt_conf_contents&gt; into &lt;qt_conf_dir&gt;.

          resolve_qt4_paths(&lt;paths_var&gt; [&lt;executable_path&gt;])

       Loop  through  &lt;paths_var&gt; list and if any don't exist resolve them relative to the &lt;executable_path&gt; (if
       supplied) or the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.

          fixup_qt4_executable(&lt;executable&gt;
            [&lt;qtplugins&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt; &lt;plugins_dir&gt; &lt;request_qt_conf&gt;])

       Copies Qt plugins, writes a Qt configuration file (if  needed)  and  fixes  up  a  Qt4  executable  using
       BundleUtilities  so it is standalone and can be drag-and-drop copied to another machine as long as all of
       the system libraries are compatible.

       &lt;executable&gt; should point to the executable to be fixed-up.

       &lt;qtplugins&gt; should contain a list of the names or paths of any Qt plugins to be installed.

       &lt;libs&gt; will be passed to BundleUtilities and should be a list of any already installed plugins, libraries
       or executables to also be fixed-up.

       &lt;dirs&gt; will be passed to BundleUtilities and should contain  and  directories  to  be  searched  to  find
       library dependencies.

       &lt;plugins_dir&gt; allows an custom plugins directory to be used.

       &lt;request_qt_conf&gt; will force a qt.conf file to be written even if not needed.

          install_qt4_plugin_path(plugin executable copy installed_plugin_path_var
                                  &lt;plugins_dir&gt; &lt;component&gt; &lt;configurations&gt;)

       Install  (or  copy)  a  resolved &lt;plugin&gt; to the default plugins directory (or &lt;plugins_dir&gt;) relative to
       &lt;executable&gt; and store the result in &lt;installed_plugin_path_var&gt;.

       If &lt;copy&gt; is set to TRUE then the plugins will be copied rather than installed.  This is  to  allow  this
       module to be used at CMake time rather than install time.

       If &lt;component&gt; is set then anything installed will use this COMPONENT.

          install_qt4_plugin(plugin executable copy installed_plugin_path_var
                             &lt;plugins_dir&gt; &lt;component&gt;)

       Install  (or copy) an unresolved &lt;plugin&gt; to the default plugins directory (or &lt;plugins_dir&gt;) relative to
       &lt;executable&gt;   and   store   the   result   in   &lt;installed_plugin_path_var&gt;.    See   documentation   of
       INSTALL_QT4_PLUGIN_PATH.

          install_qt4_executable(&lt;executable&gt;
            [&lt;qtplugins&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt; &lt;plugins_dir&gt; &lt;request_qt_conf&gt; &lt;component&gt;])

       Installs  Qt  plugins,  writes  a  Qt  configuration file (if needed) and fixes up a Qt4 executable using
       BundleUtilities so it is standalone and can be drag-and-drop copied to another machine as long as all  of
       the  system  libraries  are compatible.  The executable will be fixed-up at install time.  &lt;component&gt; is
       the COMPONENT used for bundle fixup and plugin installation.  See documentation of FIXUP_QT4_BUNDLE.

   <b>ExternalData</b>
       Manage data files stored outside source tree

   <b>Introduction</b>
       Use this module to unambiguously reference data files stored outside the source tree and  fetch  them  at
       build  time  from  arbitrary  local  and  remote content-addressed locations.  Functions provided by this
       module recognize arguments with the syntax <b>DATA{&lt;name&gt;}</b> as references to external data, replace them with
       full paths to local copies of those data, and create build rules to fetch and update the local copies.

       For example:

          include(ExternalData)
          set(ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES "file:///local/%(algo)/%(hash)"
                                         "file:////host/share/%(algo)/%(hash)"
                                         "<a href="http://data.org/">http://data.org/</a>%(algo)/%(hash)")
          ExternalData_Add_Test(MyData
            NAME MyTest
            COMMAND MyExe DATA{MyInput.png}
            )
          ExternalData_Add_Target(MyData)

       When test <b>MyTest</b> runs the <b>DATA{MyInput.png}</b> argument will be replaced by the full path to a real instance
       of the data file <b>MyInput.png</b> on disk.  If the source tree contains a content link such as <b>MyInput.png.md5</b>
       then the <b>MyData</b> target creates a real <b>MyInput.png</b> in the build tree.

   <b>Module</b> <b>Functions</b>
       <b>ExternalData_Expand_Arguments</b>
              The <b>ExternalData_Expand_Arguments</b> function  evaluates  <b>DATA{}</b>  references  in  its  arguments  and
              constructs a new list of arguments:

                 ExternalData_Expand_Arguments(
                   &lt;target&gt;   # Name of data management target
                   &lt;outVar&gt;   # Output variable
                   [args...]  # Input arguments, DATA{} allowed
                   )

              It  replaces  each  <b>DATA{}</b> reference in an argument with the full path of a real data file on disk
              that will exist after the <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> builds.

       <b>ExternalData_Add_Test</b>
              The <b>ExternalData_Add_Test</b> function wraps around the CMake <u>add_test()</u> command but  supports  <b>DATA{}</b>
              references in its arguments:

                 ExternalData_Add_Test(
                   &lt;target&gt;   # Name of data management target
                   ...        # Arguments of add_test(), DATA{} allowed
                   )

              It  passes  its  arguments  through  <b>ExternalData_Expand_Arguments</b> and then invokes the <u>add_test()</u>
              command using the results.

              Changed in version 3.31: If the arguments after <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> define a test with an executable that  is
              a  CMake  target, empty values in the <u>TEST_LAUNCHER</u> and <u>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u> properties of that
              target are preserved.  See policy <u>CMP0178</u>.

       <b>ExternalData_Add_Target</b>
              The <b>ExternalData_Add_Target</b> function creates a custom target to manage  local  instances  of  data
              files stored externally:

                 ExternalData_Add_Target(
                   &lt;target&gt;                  # Name of data management target
                   [SHOW_PROGRESS &lt;ON|OFF&gt;]  # Show progress during the download
                   )

              It creates custom commands in the target as necessary to make data files available for each <b>DATA{}</b>
              reference  previously  evaluated  by  other  functions provided by this module.  Data files may be
              fetched from one of the URL templates specified in the <b>ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES</b> variable, or may
              be found locally in one of the paths specified in the <b>ExternalData_OBJECT_STORES</b> variable.

              Added in version 3.20: The <b>SHOW_PROGRESS</b> argument may be passed to suppress  progress  information
              during  the  download  of  objects.  If  not  provided,  it  defaults  to  <b>OFF</b> for <u>Ninja</u> and <u>Ninja</u>
              <u>Multi-Config</u> generators and <b>ON</b> otherwise.

              Typically only one target is needed to manage all external  data  within  a  project.   Call  this
              function once at the end of configuration after all data references have been processed.

   <b>Module</b> <b>Variables</b>
       The  following  variables  configure  behavior.   They  should be set before calling any of the functions
       provided by this module.

       <b>ExternalData_BINARY_ROOT</b>
              The <b>ExternalData_BINARY_ROOT</b> variable may be set to the directory to  hold  the  real  data  files
              named  by expanded <b>DATA{}</b> references.  The default is <b>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</b>.  The directory layout will
              mirror that of content links under <b>ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT</b>.

       <b>ExternalData_CUSTOM_SCRIPT_&lt;key&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              Specify a full path to a <b>.cmake</b> custom  fetch  script  identified  by  <b>&lt;key&gt;</b>  in  entries  of  the
              <b>ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES</b> list.  See <u>Custom</u> <u>Fetch</u> <u>Scripts</u>.

       <b>ExternalData_LINK_CONTENT</b>
              The  <b>ExternalData_LINK_CONTENT</b>  variable  may  be set to the name of a supported hash algorithm to
              enable automatic conversion of real data files referenced by the <b>DATA{}</b> syntax into content links.
              For each such <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> a content link named <b>&lt;file&gt;&lt;ext&gt;</b> is created.  The original file is renamed to
              the form <b>.ExternalData_&lt;algo&gt;_&lt;hash&gt;</b> to stage it for future transmission to one of  the  locations
              in  the  list  of  URL templates (by means outside the scope of this module).  The data fetch rule
              created for the content link will use the staged object if  it  cannot  be  found  using  any  URL
              template.

       <b>ExternalData_NO_SYMLINKS</b>
              Added in version 3.3.

              The   real   data  files  named  by  expanded  <b>DATA{}</b>  references  may  be  made  available  under
              <b>ExternalData_BINARY_ROOT</b> using symbolic links on  some  platforms.   The  <b>ExternalData_NO_SYMLINKS</b>
              variable may be set to disable use of symbolic links and enable use of copies instead.

       <b>ExternalData_OBJECT_STORES</b>
              The  <b>ExternalData_OBJECT_STORES</b>  variable  may  be  set  to a list of local directories that store
              objects using the layout <b>&lt;dir&gt;/%(algo)/%(hash)</b>.  These directories will be searched  first  for  a
              needed object.  If the object is not available in any store then it will be fetched remotely using
              the  URL  templates  and  added  to  the first local store listed.  If no stores are specified the
              default is a location inside the build tree.

       <b>ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE</b>

       <b>ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_PREFIX</b>

       <b>ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_NUMBER</b>

       <b>ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_SUFFIX</b>

       <b>ExternalData_SERIES_MATCH</b>
              See <u>Referencing</u> <u>File</u> <u>Series</u>.

       <b>ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT</b>
              The <b>ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT</b> variable may be set to the highest source  directory  containing  any
              path  named by a <b>DATA{}</b> reference.  The default is <b>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</b>.  <b>ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT</b> and
              <b>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</b> must refer to directories within a single source distribution  (e.g.   they  come
              together in one tarball).

       <b>ExternalData_TIMEOUT_ABSOLUTE</b>
              The  <b>ExternalData_TIMEOUT_ABSOLUTE</b> variable sets the download absolute timeout, in seconds, with a
              default of <b>300</b> seconds.  Set to <b>0</b> to disable enforcement.

       <b>ExternalData_TIMEOUT_INACTIVITY</b>
              The <b>ExternalData_TIMEOUT_INACTIVITY</b> variable sets the download  inactivity  timeout,  in  seconds,
              with a default of <b>60</b> seconds.  Set to <b>0</b> to disable enforcement.

       <b>ExternalData_URL_ALGO_&lt;algo&gt;_&lt;key&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.3.

              Specify  a  custom  URL  component  to  be  substituted  for URL template placeholders of the form
              <b>%(algo:&lt;key&gt;)</b>, where <b>&lt;key&gt;</b> is a valid C identifier, when fetching an object  referenced  via  hash
              algorithm <b>&lt;algo&gt;</b>.  If not defined, the default URL component is just <b>&lt;algo&gt;</b> for any <b>&lt;key&gt;</b>.

       <b>ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES</b>
              The  <b>ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES</b>  may  be  set  to  provide  a  list  of  URL  templates  using the
              placeholders <b>%(algo)</b> and <b>%(hash)</b> in each template.  Data fetch rules  try  each  URL  template  in
              order  by  substituting  the  hash  algorithm  name  for  <b>%(algo)</b>  and the hash value for <b>%(hash)</b>.
              Alternatively one may use <b>%(algo:&lt;key&gt;)</b> with <b>ExternalData_URL_ALGO_&lt;algo&gt;_&lt;key&gt;</b> variables to  gain
              more flexibility in remote URLs.

   <b>Referencing</b> <b>Files</b>
   <b>Referencing</b> <b>Single</b> <b>Files</b>
       The  <b>DATA{}</b>  syntax  is  literal  and  the <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> is a full or relative path within the source tree.  The
       source tree must contain either a real data file at <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> or a "content link" at <b>&lt;name&gt;&lt;ext&gt;</b>  containing
       a  hash  of  the  real  file  using  a  hash algorithm corresponding to <b>&lt;ext&gt;</b>.  For example, the argument
       <b>DATA{img.png}</b> may be satisfied by either a real <b>img.png</b>  file  in  the  current  source  directory  or  a
       <b>img.png.md5</b> file containing its MD5 sum.

       Added  in  version  3.8:  Multiple  content  links  of  the  same name with different hash algorithms are
       supported (e.g. <b>img.png.sha256</b> and <b>img.png.sha1</b>) so long as they all correspond to the  same  real  file.
       This allows objects to be fetched from sources indexed by different hash algorithms.

   <b>Referencing</b> <b>File</b> <b>Series</b>
       The  <b>DATA{}</b>  syntax  can  be  told  to  fetch a file series using the form <b>DATA{&lt;name&gt;,:}</b>, where the <b>:</b> is
       literal.  If the source tree contains a group of files or content  links  named  like  a  series  then  a
       reference  to  one member adds rules to fetch all of them.  Although all members of a series are fetched,
       only the file originally named by the <b>DATA{}</b> argument is substituted for it.  The  default  configuration
       recognizes  file  series  names  ending  with  <b>#.ext</b>,  <b>_#.ext</b>, <b>.#.ext</b>, or <b>-#.ext</b> where <b>#</b> is a sequence of
       decimal digits and <b>.ext</b> is any single extension.  Configure it with a  regex  that  parses  <b>&lt;number&gt;</b>  and
       <b>&lt;suffix&gt;</b> parts from the end of <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>:

          ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE = regex of the form (&lt;number&gt;)(&lt;suffix&gt;)$

       For more complicated cases set:

          ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE = regex with at least two () groups
          ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_PREFIX = &lt;prefix&gt; regex group number, if any
          ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_NUMBER = &lt;number&gt; regex group number
          ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_SUFFIX = &lt;suffix&gt; regex group number

       Configure  series  number  matching  with  a regex that matches the <b>&lt;number&gt;</b> part of series members named
       <b>&lt;prefix&gt;&lt;number&gt;&lt;suffix&gt;</b>:

          ExternalData_SERIES_MATCH = regex matching &lt;number&gt; in all series members

       Note that the <b>&lt;suffix&gt;</b> of a series does not include a hash-algorithm extension.

   <b>Referencing</b> <b>Associated</b> <b>Files</b>
       The <b>DATA{}</b> syntax can alternatively match files associated with the named file and contained in the  same
       directory.  Associated files may be specified by options using the syntax <b>DATA{&lt;name&gt;,&lt;opt1&gt;,&lt;opt2&gt;,...}</b>.
       Each  option  may  specify one file by name or specify a regular expression to match file names using the
       syntax <b>REGEX:&lt;regex&gt;</b>.  For example, the arguments:

          DATA{MyData/MyInput.mhd,MyInput.img}                   # File pair
          DATA{MyData/MyFrames00.png,REGEX:MyFrames[0-9]+\\.png} # Series

       will pass <b>MyInput.mha</b> and <b>MyFrames00.png</b> on the command line but ensure that  the  associated  files  are
       present next to them.

   <b>Referencing</b> <b>Directories</b>
       The  <b>DATA{}</b>  syntax may reference a directory using a trailing slash and a list of associated files.  The
       form <b>DATA{&lt;name&gt;/,&lt;opt1&gt;,&lt;opt2&gt;,...}</b> adds rules to fetch any files in the directory that match one of the
       associated file options.  For example, the argument <b>DATA{MyDataDir/,REGEX:.*}</b> will pass the full path  to
       a  <b>MyDataDir</b>  directory on the command line and ensure that the directory contains files corresponding to
       every file or content link in the <b>MyDataDir</b> source directory.

       Added in version 3.3: In order to match associated files in subdirectories, specify  a  <b>RECURSE:</b>  option,
       e.g. <b>DATA{MyDataDir/,RECURSE:,REGEX:.*}</b>.

   <b>Hash</b> <b>Algorithms</b>
       The following hash algorithms are supported:

          %(algo)     &lt;ext&gt;     Description
          -------     -----     -----------
          MD5         .md5      Message-Digest Algorithm 5, RFC 1321
          SHA1        .sha1     US Secure Hash Algorithm 1, RFC 3174
          SHA224      .sha224   US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634
          SHA256      .sha256   US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634
          SHA384      .sha384   US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634
          SHA512      .sha512   US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634
          SHA3_224    .sha3-224 Keccak SHA-3
          SHA3_256    .sha3-256 Keccak SHA-3
          SHA3_384    .sha3-384 Keccak SHA-3
          SHA3_512    .sha3-512 Keccak SHA-3

       Added in version 3.8: Added the <b>SHA3_*</b> hash algorithms.

       Note that the hashes are used only for unique data identification and download verification.

   <b>Custom</b> <b>Fetch</b> <b>Scripts</b>
       Added in version 3.2.

       When   a   data   file   must   be   fetched   from   one   of   the   URL  templates  specified  in  the
       <b>ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES</b> variable, it is normally downloaded using the <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u> command.  One may
       specify   usage   of   a   custom   fetch   script   by   using   a   URL   template    of    the    form
       <b>ExternalDataCustomScript://&lt;key&gt;/&lt;loc&gt;</b>.  The <b>&lt;key&gt;</b> must be a C identifier, and the <b>&lt;loc&gt;</b> must contain the
       <b>%(algo)</b> and <b>%(hash)</b> placeholders.  A variable corresponding to the key, <b>ExternalData_CUSTOM_SCRIPT_&lt;key&gt;</b>,
       must  be set to the full path to a <b>.cmake</b> script file.  The script will be included to perform the actual
       fetch, and provided with the following variables:

       <b>ExternalData_CUSTOM_LOCATION</b>
              When a custom fetch script is loaded, this variable is set to the location part of the URL,  which
              will contain the substituted hash algorithm name and content hash value.

       <b>ExternalData_CUSTOM_FILE</b>
              When a custom fetch script is loaded, this variable is set to the full path to a file in which the
              script  must  store  the  fetched  content.  The name of the file is unspecified and should not be
              interpreted in any way.

       The custom fetch script is expected to store fetched content in the file or set a variable:

       <b>ExternalData_CUSTOM_ERROR</b>
              When a custom fetch script fails to fetch the requested content, it must set this  variable  to  a
              short one-line message describing the reason for failure.

   <b>ExternalProject</b>
   <b>External</b> <b>Project</b> <b>Definition</b>
       <b>ExternalProject_Add</b>
              The  <b>ExternalProject_Add()</b>  function  creates  a  custom  target  to drive download, update/patch,
              configure, build, install and test steps of an external project:

                 ExternalProject_Add(&lt;name&gt; [&lt;option&gt;...])

              The individual steps within the process can be driven independently if required  (e.g.  for  CDash
              submission)  and  extra  custom  steps  can be defined, along with the ability to control the step
              dependencies. The directory structure used for the management of the external project can also  be
              customized.  The  function  supports  a  large  number  of options which can be used to tailor the
              external project behavior.

   <b>Directory</b> <b>Options</b>
       Most of the time, the default directory layout is sufficient. It is largely an implementation detail that
       the main project usually doesn't need to  change.  In  some  circumstances,  however,  control  over  the
       directory  layout  can be useful or necessary. The directory options are potentially more useful from the
       point of view that the main build can use the <u>ExternalProject_Get_Property()</u> command  to  retrieve  their
       values, thereby allowing the main project to refer to build artifacts of the external project.

       <b>PREFIX</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Root  directory  for  the  external  project.  Unless otherwise noted below, all other directories
              associated with the external project will be created under here.

       <b>TMP_DIR</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Directory in which to store temporary files.

       <b>STAMP_DIR</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Directory in which to store the timestamps of each step. Log files from individual steps are  also
              created in here unless overridden by LOG_DIR (see <u>Logging</u> <u>Options</u> below).

       <b>LOG_DIR</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.14.

              Directory in which to store the logs of each step.

       <b>DOWNLOAD_DIR</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Directory in which to store downloaded files before unpacking them. This directory is only used by
              the URL download method, all other download methods use <b>SOURCE_DIR</b> directly instead.

       <b>SOURCE_DIR</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Source directory into which downloaded contents will be unpacked, or for non-URL download methods,
              the directory in which the repository should be checked out, cloned, etc. If no download method is
              specified,  this  must  point to an existing directory where the external project has already been
              unpacked or cloned/checked out.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If a download method is specified, any  existing  contents  of  the  source  directory  may  be
                 deleted.  Only the URL download method checks whether this directory is either missing or empty
                 before initiating the download, stopping with an error if it is not empty. All  other  download
                 methods silently discard any previous contents of the source directory.

       <b>BINARY_DIR</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Specify the build directory location. This option is ignored if <b>BUILD_IN_SOURCE</b> is enabled.

       <b>INSTALL_DIR</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Installation  prefix  to  be  placed  in  the  <b>&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;</b>  placeholder.  This does not actually
              configure the external project to install to the given  prefix.  That  must  be  done  by  passing
              appropriate arguments to the external project configuration step, e.g. using <b>&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;</b>.

       If  any  of  the  above <b>..._DIR</b> options are not specified, their defaults are computed as follows. If the
       <b>PREFIX</b> option is given or the <b>EP_PREFIX</b> directory property is set, then an external project is built  and
       installed under the specified prefix:

          TMP_DIR      = &lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>
          STAMP_DIR    = &lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt;-stamp
          DOWNLOAD_DIR = &lt;prefix&gt;/src
          SOURCE_DIR   = &lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt;
          BINARY_DIR   = &lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt;-build
          INSTALL_DIR  = &lt;prefix&gt;
          LOG_DIR      = &lt;STAMP_DIR&gt;

       Otherwise,  if  the  <b>EP_BASE</b>  directory property is set then components of an external project are stored
       under the specified base:

          TMP_DIR      = &lt;base&gt;<a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>&lt;name&gt;
          STAMP_DIR    = &lt;base&gt;/Stamp/&lt;name&gt;
          DOWNLOAD_DIR = &lt;base&gt;/Download/&lt;name&gt;
          SOURCE_DIR   = &lt;base&gt;/Source/&lt;name&gt;
          BINARY_DIR   = &lt;base&gt;/Build/&lt;name&gt;
          INSTALL_DIR  = &lt;base&gt;/Install/&lt;name&gt;
          LOG_DIR      = &lt;STAMP_DIR&gt;

       If no <b>PREFIX</b>, <b>EP_PREFIX</b>, or <b>EP_BASE</b> is specified, then the default is to  set  <b>PREFIX</b>  to  <b>&lt;name&gt;-prefix</b>.
       Relative   paths   are   interpreted   with  respect  to  <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u>  at  the  point  where
       <b>ExternalProject_Add()</b> is called.

   <b>Download</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Options</b>
       A download method can be omitted if the <b>SOURCE_DIR</b> option is used  to  point  to  an  existing  non-empty
       directory.  Otherwise,  one  of  the  download methods below must be specified (multiple download methods
       should not be given) or a custom <b>DOWNLOAD_COMMAND</b> provided.

       <b>DOWNLOAD_COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
              Overrides the command used for the download step (<u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> are  supported).  If  this
              option  is  specified,  all  other download options will be ignored. Providing an empty string for
              <b>&lt;cmd&gt;</b> effectively disables the download step.

   <b>URL</b>
       <b>URL</b> <b>&lt;url1&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;url2&gt;...]</b>
              List of paths and/or URL(s) of the external project's source. When more than  one  URL  is  given,
              they  are tried in turn until one succeeds. A URL may be an ordinary path in the local file system
              (in which case it must be the only  URL  provided)  or  any  downloadable  URL  supported  by  the
              <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u> command. A local filesystem path may refer to either an existing directory or to an
              archive  file,  whereas  a  URL is expected to point to a file which can be treated as an archive.
              When an archive is used, it will be unpacked automatically unless the  <b>DOWNLOAD_NO_EXTRACT</b>  option
              is  set to prevent it. The archive type is determined by inspecting the actual content rather than
              using logic based on the file extension.

              Changed in version 3.7: Multiple URLs are allowed.

       <b>URL_HASH</b> <b>&lt;algo&gt;=&lt;hashValue&gt;</b>
              Hash of the archive file to be downloaded. The argument should be of the  form  <b>&lt;algo&gt;=&lt;hashValue&gt;</b>
              where  <b>algo</b>  can be any of the hashing algorithms supported by the <u>file()</u> command. Specifying this
              option is strongly recommended for URL downloads, as it ensures the integrity  of  the  downloaded
              content.  It  is also used as a check for a previously downloaded file, allowing connection to the
              remote location to be avoided altogether if the local directory already has a file from an earlier
              download that matches the specified hash.

       <b>URL_MD5</b> <b>&lt;md5&gt;</b>
              Equivalent to <b>URL_HASH</b> <b>MD5=&lt;md5&gt;</b>.

       <b>DOWNLOAD_NAME</b> <b>&lt;fname&gt;</b>
              File name to use for the downloaded file. If not given, the end of the URL is  used  to  determine
              the  file  name.  This  option is rarely needed, the default name is generally suitable and is not
              normally used outside of code internal to the <b>ExternalProject</b> module.

       <b>DOWNLOAD_EXTRACT_TIMESTAMP</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              When specified with a true value, the timestamps of the extracted files will match  those  in  the
              archive.  When  false,  the  timestamps  of the extracted files will reflect the time at which the
              extraction was performed. If the download URL changes, timestamps based off those in  the  archive
              can  result  in  dependent  targets  not  being  rebuilt  when  they potentially should have been.
              Therefore, unless the file timestamps are significant to the project in  some  way,  use  a  false
              value  for  this  option.  If  <b>DOWNLOAD_EXTRACT_TIMESTAMP</b>  is not given, the default is false. See
              policy <u>CMP0135</u>.

       <b>DOWNLOAD_NO_EXTRACT</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.6.

              Allows the extraction part of the download step to be disabled by passing a boolean true value for
              this option. If this option is not given, the downloaded contents will be  unpacked  automatically
              if required. If extraction has been disabled, the full path to the downloaded file is available as
              <b>&lt;DOWNLOADED_FILE&gt;</b>   in   subsequent   steps   or   as   the   property  <b>DOWNLOADED_FILE</b>  with  the
              <u>ExternalProject_Get_Property()</u> command.

       <b>DOWNLOAD_NO_PROGRESS</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Can be used to disable logging the download progress.  If  this  option  is  not  given,  download
              progress messages will be logged.

       <b>TIMEOUT</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              Maximum time allowed for file download operations.

       <b>INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              Terminate the operation after a period of inactivity.

       <b>HTTP_USERNAME</b> <b>&lt;username&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Username for the download operation if authentication is required.

       <b>HTTP_PASSWORD</b> <b>&lt;password&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Password for the download operation if authentication is required.

       <b>HTTP_HEADER</b> <b>&lt;header1&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;header2&gt;...]</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Provides  an  arbitrary  list  of HTTP headers for the download operation.  This can be useful for
              accessing content in systems like AWS, etc.

       <b>TLS_VERSION</b> <b>&lt;min&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.30.

              Specify minimum TLS version for <b>https://</b> URLs.  If this option is not provided, the value  of  the
              <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERSION</u> variable or the <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERSION</u> environment variable will be used instead (see
              <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u>).

              This option also applies to <b>git</b> <b>clone</b> invocations, although the default behavior is different.  If
              none  of  the  <b>TLS_VERSION</b>  option,  <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERSION</u>  variable, or <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERSION</u> environment
              variable is specified, the behavior will be determined by git's default or a  <b>http.sslVersion</b>  git
              config option the user may have set at a global level.

       <b>TLS_VERIFY</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Specifies  whether certificate verification should be performed for <b>https://</b> URLs.  If this option
              is not provided, the value of the <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY</u> variable or  the  <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY</u>  environment
              variable  will  be  used  instead  (see  <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u>).  If neither of those is set, certificate
              verification will not be performed.  In situations where <b>URL_HASH</b> cannot be provided, this  option
              can be an alternative verification measure.

              This option also applies to <b>git</b> <b>clone</b> invocations, although the default behavior is different.  If
              none of the <b>TLS_VERIFY</b> option, <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY</u> variable, or <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY</u> environment variable
              is  specified,  the  behavior  will  be determined by git's default (true) or a <b>http.sslVerify</b> git
              config option the user may have set at a global level.

              Changed in version 3.6: Previously this option did not apply to <b>git</b> <b>clone</b> invocations.

              Changed in version 3.30: Previously the <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY</u> environment variable was not checked.

       <b>TLS_CAINFO</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Specify a custom certificate authority file to use if <b>TLS_VERIFY</b> is enabled. If this option is not
              specified, the value of the <u>CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO</u> variable will be used instead (see <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u>)

       <b>NETRC</b> <b>&lt;level&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.11.

              Specify whether the <b>.netrc</b> file is to be used for operation.  If this option is not specified, the
              value of the <u>CMAKE_NETRC</u> variable will be used instead (see <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u>).  Valid levels are:

              <b>IGNORED</b>
                     The <b>.netrc</b> file is ignored.  This is the default.

              <b>OPTIONAL</b>
                     The <b>.netrc</b> file is optional, and information in the URL is preferred.   The  file  will  be
                     scanned to find which ever information is not specified in the URL.

              <b>REQUIRED</b>
                     The <b>.netrc</b> file is required, and information in the URL is ignored.

       <b>NETRC_FILE</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.11.

              Specify  an  alternative  <b>.netrc</b>  file  to  the  one  in your home directory if the <b>NETRC</b> level is
              <b>OPTIONAL</b> or <b>REQUIRED</b>. If this option is not specified, the value of the <u>CMAKE_NETRC_FILE</u>  variable
              will be used instead (see <u>file(DOWNLOAD)</u>)

       Added in version 3.1: Added support for <u>tbz2</u>, <u>.tar.xz</u>, <u>.txz</u>, and <u>.7z</u> extensions.

   <b>Git</b>
       NOTE: A git version of 1.6.5 or later is required if this download method is used.

       <b>GIT_REPOSITORY</b> <b>&lt;url&gt;</b>
              URL of the git repository. Any URL understood by the <b>git</b> command may be used.

              Changed  in  version  3.27:  A relative URL will be resolved based on the parent project's remote,
              subject to <u>CMP0150</u>.  See the policy documentation  for  how  the  remote  is  selected,  including
              conditions  where  the  remote  selection  can  fail.   Local filesystem remotes should always use
              absolute paths.

       <b>GIT_TAG</b> <b>&lt;tag&gt;</b>
              Git branch name, tag or commit hash. Note that branch names and tags should generally be specified
              as remote names (i.e. <b>origin/myBranch</b> rather than simply  <b>myBranch</b>).  This  ensures  that  if  the
              remote end has its tag moved or branch rebased or history rewritten, the local clone will still be
              updated  correctly. In general, however, specifying a commit hash should be preferred for a number
              of reasons:

              • If the local clone already has the commit corresponding to the hash, no <b>git</b> <b>fetch</b>  needs  to  be
                performed to check for changes each time CMake is re-run. This can result in a significant speed
                up if many external projects are being used.

              • Using  a  specific  git hash ensures that the main project's own history is fully traceable to a
                specific point in the external project's evolution. If a branch or tag  name  is  used  instead,
                then  checking out a specific commit of the main project doesn't necessarily pin the whole build
                to a specific point in the life of  the  external  project.   The  lack  of  such  deterministic
                behavior makes the main project lose traceability and repeatability.

              If  <b>GIT_SHALLOW</b>  is  enabled then <b>GIT_TAG</b> works only with branch names and tags.  A commit hash is
              not allowed.

              Note that if not provided, <b>GIT_TAG</b> defaults to <b>master</b>, not the default Git branch name.

       <b>GIT_REMOTE_NAME</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              The optional name of the remote. If this option is not specified, it defaults to <b>origin</b>.

       <b>GIT_SUBMODULES</b> <b>&lt;module&gt;...</b>
              Specific git submodules that should also be updated. If this  option  is  not  provided,  all  git
              submodules will be updated.

              Changed  in version 3.16: When <u>CMP0097</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>, if this value is set to an empty string then
              no submodules are initialized or updated.

       <b>GIT_SUBMODULES_RECURSE</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.17.

              Specify whether git submodules (if any) should update recursively by passing the <b>--recursive</b>  flag
              to <b>git</b> <b>submodule</b> <b>update</b>.  If not specified, the default is on.

       <b>GIT_SHALLOW</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.6.

              When  this  option  is  enabled,  the <b>git</b> <b>clone</b> operation will be given the <b>--depth</b> <b>1</b> option. This
              performs a shallow clone, which avoids downloading the whole history and  instead  retrieves  just
              the commit denoted by the <b>GIT_TAG</b> option.

       <b>GIT_PROGRESS</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.8.

              When  enabled,  this option instructs the <b>git</b> <b>clone</b> operation to report its progress by passing it
              the <b>--progress</b> option. Without this option, the clone step for large projects may appear  to  make
              the  build  stall,  since  nothing  will  be logged until the clone operation finishes. While this
              option can be used to provide progress to prevent the appearance of the build having  stalled,  it
              may also make the build overly noisy if lots of external projects are used.

       <b>GIT_CONFIG</b> <b>&lt;option1&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;option2&gt;...]</b>
              Added in version 3.8.

              Specify a list of config options to pass to <b>git</b> <b>clone</b>. Each option listed will be transformed into
              its  own  <b>--config</b>  <b>&lt;option&gt;</b> on the <b>git</b> <b>clone</b> command line, with each option required to be in the
              form <b>key=value</b>.

       <b>GIT_REMOTE_UPDATE_STRATEGY</b> <b>&lt;strategy&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              When <b>GIT_TAG</b> refers to a remote branch, this option can be used to specify  how  the  update  step
              behaves.  The <b>&lt;strategy&gt;</b> must be one of the following:

              <b>CHECKOUT</b>
                     Ignore the local branch and always checkout the branch specified by <b>GIT_TAG</b>.

              <b>REBASE</b> Try  to  rebase  the  current  branch  to the one specified by <b>GIT_TAG</b>.  If there are local
                     uncommitted changes, they will be stashed  first  and  popped  again  after  rebasing.   If
                     rebasing  or  popping  stashed changes fail, abort the rebase and halt with an error.  When
                     <b>GIT_REMOTE_UPDATE_STRATEGY</b> is not present, this is the default strategy unless the  default
                     has been overridden with <b>CMAKE_EP_GIT_REMOTE_UPDATE_STRATEGY</b> (see below).  Note that if the
                     branch specified in <b>GIT_TAG</b> is different to the upstream branch currently being tracked, it
                     is  not  safe  to  perform  a rebase. In that situation, <b>REBASE</b> will silently be treated as
                     <b>CHECKOUT</b> instead.

              <b>REBASE_CHECKOUT</b>
                     Same as <b>REBASE</b> except if the rebase fails, an annotated tag will be created at the original
                     <b>HEAD</b> position from before the rebase and then  checkout  <b>GIT_TAG</b>  just  like  the  <b>CHECKOUT</b>
                     strategy.   The  message  stored  on the annotated tag will give information about what was
                     attempted and the tag name will include a timestamp so that each failed run will add a  new
                     tag.   This  strategy ensures no changes will be lost, but updates should always succeed if
                     <b>GIT_TAG</b> refers to a valid ref unless there are uncommitted changes that  cannot  be  popped
                     successfully.

              The  variable  <b>CMAKE_EP_GIT_REMOTE_UPDATE_STRATEGY</b>  can  be  set to override the default strategy.
              This variable should not be set by a project, it is intended for the user to set.  It is primarily
              intended for use in continuous integration scripts to ensure that when history is rewritten  on  a
              remote  branch,  the  build doesn't end up with unintended changes or failed builds resulting from
              conflicts during rebase operations.

   <b>Subversion</b>
       <b>SVN_REPOSITORY</b> <b>&lt;url&gt;</b>
              URL of the Subversion repository.

       <b>SVN_REVISION</b> <b>-r&lt;rev&gt;</b>
              Revision to checkout from the Subversion repository.

       <b>SVN_USERNAME</b> <b>&lt;username&gt;</b>
              Username for the Subversion checkout and update.

       <b>SVN_PASSWORD</b> <b>&lt;password&gt;</b>
              Password for the Subversion checkout and update.

       <b>SVN_TRUST_CERT</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Specifies  whether  to  trust  the  Subversion  server   site   certificate.   If   enabled,   the
              <b>--trust-server-cert</b> option is passed to the <b>svn</b> checkout and update commands.

   <b>Mercurial</b>
       <b>HG_REPOSITORY</b> <b>&lt;url&gt;</b>
              URL of the mercurial repository.

       <b>HG_TAG</b> <b>&lt;tag&gt;</b>
              Mercurial branch name, tag or commit id.

   <b>CVS</b>
       <b>CVS_REPOSITORY</b> <b>&lt;cvsroot&gt;</b>
              CVSROOT of the CVS repository.

       <b>CVS_MODULE</b> <b>&lt;mod&gt;</b>
              Module to checkout from the CVS repository.

       <b>CVS_TAG</b> <b>&lt;tag&gt;</b>
              Tag to checkout from the CVS repository.

   <b>Update</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Options</b>
       Whenever  CMake  is  re-run,  by  default  the external project's sources will be updated if the download
       method supports updates (e.g. a git repository would be checked if  the  <b>GIT_TAG</b>  does  not  refer  to  a
       specific commit).

       <b>UPDATE_COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
              Overrides  the download method's update step with a custom command.  The command may use <u>generator</u>
              <u>expressions</u>.

       <b>UPDATE_DISCONNECTED</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              When enabled, this option causes the update step to be skipped (but see below for changed behavior
              where this is not the case). It does not prevent the download step. The update step can  still  be
              added as a step target (see <u>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</u>) and called manually. This is useful
              if  you  want  to  allow  developers  to build the project when disconnected from the network (the
              network may still be needed for the download step though).

              Changed in version 3.27: When <b>UPDATE_DISCONNECTED</b> is true, the update step will be executed if any
              details  about  the  update  or  download  step  are  changed.   Furthermore,  if  using  the  git
              download/update  method, the update logic will be modified to skip attempts to contact the remote.
              If the <b>GIT_TAG</b> mentions a ref that is not known locally, the update step will halt  with  a  fatal
              error.

              When  this  option  is present, it is generally advisable to make the value a cache variable under
              the developer's control rather than hard-coding it. If this option is  not  present,  the  default
              value  is  taken  from the <b>EP_UPDATE_DISCONNECTED</b> directory property. If that is also not defined,
              updates are performed as normal. The <b>EP_UPDATE_DISCONNECTED</b> directory property is  intended  as  a
              convenience  for controlling the <b>UPDATE_DISCONNECTED</b> behavior for an entire section of a project's
              directory hierarchy and may be a more convenient method of giving developers control over  whether
              or  not  to  perform  updates  (assuming  the project also provides a cache variable or some other
              convenient method for setting the directory property).

              This may cause a step target to be created  automatically  for  the  <b>download</b>  step.   See  policy
              <u>CMP0114</u>.

   <b>Patch</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>PATCH_COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
              Specifies  a  custom command to patch the sources after an update. By default, no patch command is
              defined. Note that it can be quite difficult to define an appropriate patch command that  performs
              robustly,  especially for download methods such as git where changing the <b>GIT_TAG</b> will not discard
              changes from a previous patch, but the patch command will be called again after  updating  to  the
              new tag.

   <b>Configure</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Options</b>
       The  configure  step  is  run  after  the  download and update steps. By default, the external project is
       assumed to be a CMake project, but this can be overridden if required.

       <b>CONFIGURE_COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
              The default configure command runs CMake with a few  options  based  on  the  main  project.   The
              options  added  are typically only those needed to use the same generator as the main project, but
              the <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR</b> option can be given to override this.  The project is responsible  for  adding
              any  toolchain  details,  flags  or  other  settings  it  wants  to reuse from the main project or
              otherwise specify (see <b>CMAKE_ARGS</b>, <b>CMAKE_CACHE_ARGS</b> and <b>CMAKE_CACHE_DEFAULT_ARGS</b> below).

              For non-CMake external projects, the <b>CONFIGURE_COMMAND</b> option must be used to override the default
              configure command (<u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> are supported). For projects that  require  no  configure
              step, specify this option with an empty string as the command to execute.

       <b>CMAKE_COMMAND</b> <b>/.../cmake</b>
              Specify  an  alternative  cmake  executable for the configure step (use an absolute path). This is
              generally not recommended, since it is usually desirable to use the same CMake version  throughout
              the  whole  build.  This  option  is ignored if a custom configure command has been specified with
              <b>CONFIGURE_COMMAND</b>.

       <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR</b> <b>&lt;gen&gt;</b>
              Override the CMake generator used for the configure step. Without this option, the same  generator
              as  the  main  build  will  be used. This option is ignored if a custom configure command has been
              specified with the <b>CONFIGURE_COMMAND</b> option.

       <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM</b> <b>&lt;platform&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.1.

              Pass a generator-specific platform name to the CMake command (see <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM</u>). It is
              an error to provide this option without the <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR</b> option.

       <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</b> <b>&lt;toolset&gt;</b>
              Pass a generator-specific toolset name to the CMake command (see <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</u>).  It  is
              an error to provide this option without the <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR</b> option.

       <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE</b> <b>&lt;instance&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.11.

              Pass  a generator-specific instance selection to the CMake command (see <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE</u>).
              It is an error to provide this option without the <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR</b> option.

       <b>CMAKE_ARGS</b> <b>&lt;arg&gt;...</b>
              The specified arguments are passed to the <b>cmake</b> command line.  They can be any argument the  <b>cmake</b>
              command understands, not just cache values defined by <b>-D...</b> arguments (see also <u>CMake</u> <u>Options</u>).

              Added in version 3.3: Arguments may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       <b>CMAKE_CACHE_ARGS</b> <b>&lt;arg&gt;...</b>
              This is an alternate way of specifying cache variables where command line length issues may become
              a  problem.  The  arguments  are  expected  to  be  in the form <b>-Dvar:STRING=value</b>, which are then
              transformed into CMake <u>set()</u> commands with the <b>FORCE</b> option used. These <b>set()</b> commands are written
              to a pre-load script which is then applied using the <u>cmake</u> <u>-C</u> command line option.

              Added in version 3.3: Arguments may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       <b>CMAKE_CACHE_DEFAULT_ARGS</b> <b>&lt;arg&gt;...</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              This is the same as the <b>CMAKE_CACHE_ARGS</b> option except the <b>set()</b> commands do not include the <b>FORCE</b>
              keyword. This means the values act as initial defaults only and will not  override  any  variables
              already  set  from a previous run. Use this option with care, as it can lead to different behavior
              depending on whether the build starts from a  fresh  build  directory  or  reuses  previous  build
              contents.

              Added  in  version  3.15:  If the CMake generator is the <b>Green</b> <b>Hills</b> <b>MULTI</b> and not overridden, the
              original project's settings for the GHS toolset and target system  customization  cache  variables
              are propagated into the external project.

       <b>SOURCE_SUBDIR</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              When no <b>CONFIGURE_COMMAND</b> option is specified, the configure step assumes the external project has
              a <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file at the top of its source tree (i.e. in <b>SOURCE_DIR</b>). The <b>SOURCE_SUBDIR</b> option
              can  be  used to point to an alternative directory within the source tree to use as the top of the
              CMake source tree instead. This must be a relative path  and  it  will  be  interpreted  as  being
              relative to <b>SOURCE_DIR</b>.

              Added  in version 3.14: When <b>BUILD_IN_SOURCE</b> option is enabled, the <b>BUILD_COMMAND</b> is used to point
              to an alternative directory within the source tree.

       <b>CONFIGURE_HANDLED_BY_BUILD</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.20.

              Enabling this option relaxes the dependencies of the configure step on other external projects  to
              order-only. This means the configure step will be executed after its external project dependencies
              are  built  but  it  will  not  be  marked  dirty when one of its external project dependencies is
              rebuilt. This option can be enabled when the build step is smart  enough  to  figure  out  if  the
              configure  step  needs to be rerun. CMake and Meson are examples of build systems whose build step
              is smart enough to know if the configure step needs to be rerun.

   <b>Build</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Options</b>
       If the configure step assumed the external project uses CMake as its build system, the  build  step  will
       also.  Otherwise, the build step will assume a Makefile-based build and simply run <b>make</b> with no arguments
       as the default build step. This can be overridden with custom build commands if required.

       If both the main project and the external project use make as their build tool, the  build  step  of  the
       external  project  is  invoked  as a recursive make using <b>$(MAKE)</b>.  This will communicate some build tool
       settings from the main project to the external project.  If either the main project or  external  project
       is  not  using  make,  no  build  tool  settings  will be passed to the external project other than those
       established by the configure step (i.e. running <b>ninja</b> <b>-v</b> in the main project will  not  pass  <b>-v</b>  to  the
       external project's build step, even if it also uses <b>ninja</b> as its build tool).

       <b>BUILD_COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
              Overrides  the  default build command (<u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> are supported). If this option is not
              given, the default build command will be chosen to integrate with  the  main  build  in  the  most
              appropriate way (e.g. using recursive <b>make</b> for Makefile generators or <u>cmake</u> <u>--build</u> if the project
              uses  a CMake build). This option can be specified with an empty string as the command to make the
              build step do nothing.

       <b>BUILD_IN_SOURCE</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              When this option is enabled, the build will be done directly within the external project's  source
              tree.  This  should  generally  be  avoided,  the  use  of  a  separate build directory is usually
              preferred, but it can be useful  when  the  external  project  assumes  an  in-source  build.  The
              <b>BINARY_DIR</b> option should not be specified if building in-source.

       <b>BUILD_ALWAYS</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Enabling  this  option  forces  the  build  step  to always be run. This can be the easiest way to
              robustly ensure that the external project's own  build  dependencies  are  evaluated  rather  than
              relying  on  the default success timestamp-based method. This option is not normally needed unless
              developers are expected to modify something the external project's build depends on in a way  that
              is  not  detectable  via  the step target dependencies (e.g. <b>SOURCE_DIR</b> is used without a download
              method and developers might modify the sources in <b>SOURCE_DIR</b>).

       <b>BUILD_BYPRODUCTS</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              Specifies files that will be generated by the build command but which  might  or  might  not  have
              their  modification  time  updated  by  subsequent builds. This may also be required to explicitly
              declare dependencies when using the <u>Ninja</u> generator.   These  ultimately  get  passed  through  as
              <b>BYPRODUCTS</b>  to  the build step's own underlying call to <u>add_custom_command()</u>, which has additional
              documentation.

       <b>BUILD_JOB_SERVER_AWARE</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.28.

              Specifies that the build step is aware of the GNU Make job server.  See  the  <u>add_custom_command()</u>
              documentation  of  its  <b>JOB_SERVER_AWARE</b> option for details.  This option is relevant only when an
              explicit <b>BUILD_COMMAND</b> is specified.

   <b>Install</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Options</b>
       If the configure step assumed the external project uses CMake as its build system, the install step  will
       also.  Otherwise,  the install step will assume a Makefile-based build and simply run <b>make</b> <b>install</b> as the
       default build step. This can be overridden with custom install commands if required.

       <b>INSTALL_COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
              The external project's own install step is invoked as part of the main project's <u>build</u>. It is done
              after the external project's build step and may be before or after  the  external  project's  test
              step (see the <b>TEST_BEFORE_INSTALL</b> option below). The external project's install rules are not part
              of  the main project's install rules, so if anything from the external project should be installed
              as part of the main build, these need to be specified in the main build  as  additional  <u>install()</u>
              commands. The default install step builds the <b>install</b> target of the external project, but this can
              be  overridden  with  a  custom  command  using this option (<u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> are supported).
              Passing an empty string as the <b>&lt;cmd&gt;</b> makes the install step do nothing.

       <b>INSTALL_BYPRODUCTS</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b>
              Added in version 3.26.

              Specifies files that will be generated by the install command but which might or  might  not  have
              their  modification  time  updated by subsequent installs. This may also be required to explicitly
              declare dependencies when using the <u>Ninja</u> generator.   These  ultimately  get  passed  through  as
              <b>BYPRODUCTS</b> to the install step's own underlying call to <u>add_custom_command()</u>, which has additional
              documentation.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          If  the  <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE</u>  environment  variable is set when the main project is built, it will only
          have an effect if the following conditions are met:

          • The main project's configure step assumed the external project uses CMake as its build system.

          • The external project's install command actually runs. Note that due to the way  <b>ExternalProject</b>  may
            use  timestamps  internally,  if  nothing  the  install step depends on needs to be re-executed, the
            install command might also not need to run.

          Note also that <b>ExternalProject</b> does not check  whether  the  <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE</u>  environment  variable
          changes from one run to another.

   <b>Test</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Options</b>
       The test step is only defined if at least one of the following <b>TEST_...</b>  options are provided.

       <b>TEST_COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
              Overrides  the  default  test command (<u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> are supported). If this option is not
              given, the default behavior of the test step is to build the external project's own  <b>test</b>  target.
              This option can be specified with <b>&lt;cmd&gt;</b> as an empty string, which allows the test step to still be
              defined,  but it will do nothing. Do not specify any of the other <b>TEST_...</b> options if providing an
              empty string as the test command, but prefer to omit all <b>TEST_...</b> options altogether if  the  test
              step target is not needed.

       <b>TEST_BEFORE_INSTALL</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              When  this  option is enabled, the test step will be executed before the install step. The default
              behavior is for the test step to run after the install step.

       <b>TEST_AFTER_INSTALL</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              This option is mainly useful as a way to indicate that the test step is desired  but  all  default
              behavior  is sufficient. Specifying this option with a boolean true value ensures the test step is
              defined  and  that  it  comes  after  the  install   step.   If   both   <b>TEST_BEFORE_INSTALL</b>   and
              <b>TEST_AFTER_INSTALL</b> are enabled, the latter is silently ignored.

       <b>TEST_EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              If  enabled,  the  main build's default ALL target will not depend on the test step. This can be a
              useful way of ensuring the test step is defined but only gets  invoked  when  manually  requested.
              This  may  cause  a  step target to be created automatically for either the <b>install</b> or <b>build</b> step.
              See policy <u>CMP0114</u>.

   <b>Output</b> <b>Logging</b> <b>Options</b>
       Each of the following <b>LOG_...</b> options can be used to wrap the relevant step in a script  to  capture  its
       output  to  files.  The  log  files  will  be  created  in <b>LOG_DIR</b> if supplied or otherwise the <b>STAMP_DIR</b>
       directory with step-specific file names.

       <b>LOG_DOWNLOAD</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              When enabled, the output of the download step is logged to files.

       <b>LOG_UPDATE</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              When enabled, the output of the update step is logged to files.

       <b>LOG_PATCH</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.14.

              When enabled, the output of the patch step is logged to files.

       <b>LOG_CONFIGURE</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              When enabled, the output of the configure step is logged to files.

       <b>LOG_BUILD</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              When enabled, the output of the build step is logged to files.

       <b>LOG_INSTALL</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              When enabled, the output of the install step is logged to files.

       <b>LOG_TEST</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              When enabled, the output of the test step is logged to files.

       <b>LOG_MERGED_STDOUTERR</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.14.

              When enabled, stdout and stderr will be merged for any step whose output is being logged to files.

       <b>LOG_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.14.

              This option only has an effect if at least one of the other <b>LOG_&lt;step&gt;</b> options is enabled.  If  an
              error  occurs  for a step which has logging to file enabled, that step's output will be printed to
              the console if <b>LOG_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE</b> is set to true.  For cases where a large amount of output  is
              recorded, just the end of that output may be printed to the console.

   <b>Terminal</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Options</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       Steps  can be given direct access to the terminal in some cases. Giving a step access to the terminal may
       allow it to receive terminal input if required, such as for authentication details not provided by  other
       options.   With the <u>Ninja</u> generator, these options place the steps in the <b>console</b> <u>job</u> <u>pool</u>. Each step can
       be given access to the terminal individually via the following options:

       <b>USES_TERMINAL_DOWNLOAD</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Give the download step access to the terminal.

       <b>USES_TERMINAL_UPDATE</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Give the update step access to the terminal.

       <b>USES_TERMINAL_PATCH</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.23.

              Give the patch step access to the terminal.

       <b>USES_TERMINAL_CONFIGURE</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Give the configure step access to the terminal.

       <b>USES_TERMINAL_BUILD</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Give the build step access to the terminal.

       <b>USES_TERMINAL_INSTALL</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Give the install step access to the terminal.

       <b>USES_TERMINAL_TEST</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Give the test step access to the terminal.

   <b>Target</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>DEPENDS</b> <b>&lt;targets&gt;...</b>
              Specify other targets on which the external project depends. The other targets will be brought  up
              to date before any of the external project's steps are executed. Because the external project uses
              additional  custom targets internally for each step, the <b>DEPENDS</b> option is the most convenient way
              to ensure all of those steps depend on the other targets.   Simply  doing  <u>add_dependencies(&lt;name&gt;</u>
              <u>&lt;targets&gt;)</u> will not make any of the steps dependent on <b>&lt;targets&gt;</b>.

       <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              When  enabled,  this  option excludes the external project from the default ALL target of the main
              build.

       <b>STEP_TARGETS</b> <b>&lt;step-target&gt;...</b>
              Generate custom targets for the specified steps.  This  is  required  if  the  steps  need  to  be
              triggered  manually or if they need to be used as dependencies of other targets. If this option is
              not specified, the default value is  taken  from  the  <b>EP_STEP_TARGETS</b>  directory  property.   See
              <u>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</u> below for further discussion of the effects of this option.

       <b>INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS</b> <b>&lt;step-target&gt;...</b>
              Deprecated since version 3.19: This is allowed only if policy <u>CMP0114</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b>.

              Generates  custom  targets for the specified steps and prevent these targets from having the usual
              dependencies applied to them. If this option is not specified, the default value is taken from the
              <b>EP_INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS</b>  directory  property.  This  option  is  mostly  useful  for  allowing
              individual  steps  to be driven independently, such as for a CDash setup where each step should be
              initiated   and   reported   individually    rather    than    as    one    whole    build.    See
              <u>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</u> below for further discussion of the effects of this option.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>LIST_SEPARATOR</b> <b>&lt;sep&gt;</b>
              For  any  of  the  various <b>..._COMMAND</b> options, and <b>CMAKE_ARGS</b>, <b>ExternalProject</b> will replace <b>&lt;sep&gt;</b>
              with <b>;</b> in the specified command lines. This can be used to ensure a command has a literal <b>;</b> in  it
              where  direct  usage  would otherwise be interpreted as argument separators to CMake APIs instead.
              Note that the separator should be chosen to avoid being confused for non-list-separator usages  of
              the  sequence.  For  example,  using  <b>LIST_SEPARATOR</b> allows for passing list values to CMake cache
              variables on the command line:

                 ExternalProject_Add(example
                   ... # Download options, etc.
                   LIST_SEPARATOR ","
                   CMAKE_ARGS "-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:STRING=${first_prefix},${second_prefix}"
                 )

       <b>COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
              Any of the other <b>..._COMMAND</b> options can have additional commands appended to  them  by  following
              them  with  as  many  <b>COMMAND</b>  <b>...</b>  options  as  needed (<u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> are supported). For
              example:

                 ExternalProject_Add(example
                   ... # Download options, etc.
                   BUILD_COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "Starting $&lt;CONFIG&gt; build"
                   COMMAND       ${CMAKE_COMMAND} --build &lt;BINARY_DIR&gt; --config $&lt;CONFIG&gt;
                   COMMAND       ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "$&lt;CONFIG&gt; build complete"
                 )

       It should also be noted that each build step is created via a  call  to  <u>ExternalProject_Add_Step()</u>.  See
       that command's documentation for the automatic substitutions that are supported for some options.

   <b>Obtaining</b> <b>Project</b> <b>Properties</b>
       <b>ExternalProject_Get_Property</b>
              The <b>ExternalProject_Get_Property()</b> function retrieves external project target properties:

                 ExternalProject_Get_Property(&lt;name&gt; &lt;prop1&gt; [&lt;prop2&gt;...])

              The  function  stores  property values in variables of the same name. Property names correspond to
              the keyword argument names of <b>ExternalProject_Add()</b>.  For example, the source directory  might  be
              retrieved like so:

                 ExternalProject_Get_property(myExtProj SOURCE_DIR)
                 message("Source dir of myExtProj = ${SOURCE_DIR}")

   <b>Explicit</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Management</b>
       The  <b>ExternalProject_Add()</b>  function on its own is often sufficient for incorporating an external project
       into the main build. Certain scenarios require additional work to implement  desired  behavior,  such  as
       adding   in   a   custom   step   or   making  steps  available  as  manually  triggerable  targets.  The
       <b>ExternalProject_Add_Step()</b>,  <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</b>  and  <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies</b>
       functions provide the lower level control needed to implement such step-level capabilities.

       <b>ExternalProject_Add_Step</b>
              The  <b>ExternalProject_Add_Step()</b>  function  specifies  an  additional  custom  step for an external
              project defined by an earlier call to <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>:

                 ExternalProject_Add_Step(&lt;name&gt; &lt;step&gt; [&lt;option&gt;...])

              <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> is the same as the name passed to the original call to <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>. The specified
              <b>&lt;step&gt;</b> must not be one of the pre-defined steps (<b>mkdir</b>, <b>download</b>, <b>update</b>, <b>patch</b>, <b>configure</b>, <b>build</b>,
              <b>install</b> or <b>test</b>). The supported options are:

              <b>COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
                     The command line to be executed by this custom step (<u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> are  supported).
                     This  option  can be repeated multiple times to specify multiple commands to be executed in
                     order.

              <b>COMMENT</b> <b>"&lt;text&gt;..."</b>
                     Text to be printed when the custom step executes.

              <b>DEPENDEES</b> <b>&lt;step&gt;...</b>
                     Other steps (custom or pre-defined) on which this step depends.

              <b>DEPENDERS</b> <b>&lt;step&gt;...</b>
                     Other steps (custom or pre-defined) that depend on this new custom step.

              <b>DEPENDS</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b>
                     Files on which this custom step depends.

              <b>INDEPENDENT</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                     Added in version 3.19.

                     Specifies whether this step is independent of the external dependencies  specified  by  the
                     <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>'s <b>DEPENDS</b> option.  The default is <b>FALSE</b>.  Steps marked as independent
                     may depend only on other steps marked independent.  See policy <u>CMP0114</u>.

                     Note  that  this  use  of  the term "independent" refers only to independence from external
                     targets specified by the <b>DEPENDS</b> option and is orthogonal to a step's dependencies on other
                     steps.

                     If a  step  target  is  created  for  an  independent  step  by  the  <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>
                     <b>STEP_TARGETS</b>  option  or  by  the  <u>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</u>  function, it will not
                     depend on the external targets, but may depend on targets for other steps.

              <b>BYPRODUCTS</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b>
                     Added in version 3.2.

                     Files that will be generated by this custom step but which might or might  not  have  their
                     modification  time  updated  by subsequent builds.  This may also be required to explicitly
                     declare dependencies when using the <u>Ninja</u> generator. This list of files will ultimately  be
                     passed  through  as the <b>BYPRODUCTS</b> option to the <u>add_custom_command()</u> used to implement the
                     custom step internally, which has additional documentation.

              <b>ALWAYS</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                     When enabled, this option specifies that the custom step should always be run (i.e. that it
                     is always considered out of date).

              <b>JOB_SERVER_AWARE</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                     Added in version 3.28.

                     Specifies  that  the  custom  step  is  aware  of  the  GNU  Make  job  server.   See   the
                     <u>add_custom_command()</u> documentation of its <b>JOB_SERVER_AWARE</b> option for details.

              <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                     When enabled, this option specifies that the external project's main target does not depend
                     on  the custom step.  This may cause step targets to be created automatically for the steps
                     on which this step depends.  See policy <u>CMP0114</u>.

              <b>WORKING_DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                     Specifies the working directory to set before running the custom step's  command.  If  this
                     option is not specified, the directory will be the value of the <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u> at
                     the point where <b>ExternalProject_Add_Step()</b> was called.

              <b>LOG</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                     If set, this causes the output from the custom step to be captured to files in the external
                     project's <b>LOG_DIR</b> if supplied or <b>STAMP_DIR</b>.

              <b>USES_TERMINAL</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                     If enabled, this gives the custom step direct access to the terminal if possible.

              The  command line, comment, working directory and byproducts of every standard and custom step are
              processed  to  replace  the  tokens  <b>&lt;SOURCE_DIR&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;SOURCE_SUBDIR&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;BINARY_DIR&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;</b>
              <b>&lt;TMP_DIR&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;DOWNLOAD_DIR&gt;</b>  and <b>&lt;DOWNLOADED_FILE&gt;</b> with their corresponding property values defined
              in the original call to <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>.

              Added in version 3.3: Token replacement is extended to byproducts.

              Added in version 3.11: The <b>&lt;DOWNLOAD_DIR&gt;</b> substitution token.

       <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets</b>
              The <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</b> function generates targets for the steps listed. The name of
              each created target will be of the form <b>&lt;name&gt;-&lt;step&gt;</b>:

                 ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(&lt;name&gt; &lt;step1&gt; [&lt;step2&gt;...])

              Creating a target for a step allows it to be used as a dependency  of  another  target  or  to  be
              triggered  manually. Having targets for specific steps also allows them to be driven independently
              of each other by specifying targets on build command lines. For example, you may be submitting  to
              a  sub-project  based  dashboard  where you want to drive the configure portion of the build, then
              submit to the dashboard, followed by the build portion, followed by tests. If you invoke a  custom
              target  that  depends  on  a step halfway through the step dependency chain, then all the previous
              steps will also run to ensure everything is up to date.

              Internally, <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u> calls <u>ExternalProject_Add_Step()</u> to create  each  step.  If  any
              <b>STEP_TARGETS</b>  were  specified,  then  <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</b>  will also be called after
              <u>ExternalProject_Add_Step()</u>.  Even  if  a  step  is  not  mentioned  in  the  <b>STEP_TARGETS</b>  option,
              <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</b>  can  still  be called later to manually define a target for the
              step.

              The <b>STEP_TARGETS</b> option for <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u> is generally the easiest way to  ensure  targets
              are  created  for specific steps of interest.  For custom steps, <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</b>
              must be called explicitly if a target should also be created for that custom step.  An alternative
              to these two options is to populate the <b>EP_STEP_TARGETS</b> directory property.  It acts as a  default
              for the step target options and can save having to repeatedly specify the same set of step targets
              when multiple external projects are being defined.

              Added  in  version  3.19: If <u>CMP0114</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>, step targets are fully responsible for holding
              the custom commands implementing their steps.  The primary target created  by  <b>ExternalProject_Add</b>
              depends  on  the  step  targets,  and  the  step  targets  depend on each other.  The target-level
              dependencies match the file-level dependencies used by the custom commands  for  each  step.   The
              targets  for  steps  created with <u>ExternalProject_Add_Step()</u>'s <b>INDEPENDENT</b> option do not depend on
              the external targets specified by <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>'s <b>DEPENDS</b> option.   The  predefined  steps
              <b>mkdir</b>, <b>download</b>, <b>update</b>, and <b>patch</b> are independent.

              If <u>CMP0114</u> is not <b>NEW</b>, the following deprecated behavior is available:

              • A  deprecated  <b>NO_DEPENDS</b>  option  may  be specified immediately after the <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> and before the
                first step.  If the <b>NO_DEPENDS</b> option is specified, the step  target  will  not  depend  on  the
                dependencies  of  the  external  project  (i.e.  on any dependencies of the <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> custom target
                created by <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>). This is usually safe  for  the  <b>download</b>,  <b>update</b>  and  <b>patch</b>
                steps,  since  they do not typically require that the dependencies are updated and built.  Using
                <b>NO_DEPENDS</b> for any of the other pre-defined steps, however, may break parallel builds. Only  use
                <b>NO_DEPENDS</b>  where  it  is  certain  that the named steps genuinely do not have dependencies. For
                custom steps, consider whether or not  the  custom  commands  require  the  dependencies  to  be
                configured, built and installed.

              • The      <b>INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS</b>      option      for     <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>,     or     the
                <b>EP_INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS</b>    directory    property,    tells    the    function    to     call
                <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</b>  internally  using  the  <b>NO_DEPENDS</b>  option  for the specified
                steps.

       <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              The <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies()</b> function can be used to add dependencies to a step. The
              dependencies added must be targets CMake already knows about (these can be ordinary executable  or
              library targets, custom targets or even step targets of another external project):

                 ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies(&lt;name&gt; &lt;step&gt; &lt;target1&gt; [&lt;target2&gt;...])

              This  function  takes  care  to  set  both target and file level dependencies and will ensure that
              parallel builds will not break. It should be used instead of <u>add_dependencies()</u> whenever adding  a
              dependency for some of the step targets generated by the <b>ExternalProject</b> module.

   <b>Examples</b>
       The following example shows how to download and build a hypothetical project called <u>FooBar</u> from github:

          include(ExternalProject)
          ExternalProject_Add(foobar
            GIT_REPOSITORY    <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:FooCo/FooBar.git
            GIT_TAG           origin/release/1.2.3
          )

       For the sake of the example, also define a second hypothetical external project called <u>SecretSauce</u>, which
       is  downloaded  from  a  web server. Two URLs are given to take advantage of a faster internal network if
       available, with a fallback to a slower external server. The project is a typical <b>Makefile</b> project with no
       configure step, so some of the default commands are overridden. The build is only required to  build  the
       <u>sauce</u> target:

          find_program(MAKE_EXE NAMES gmake nmake make)
          ExternalProject_Add(secretsauce
            URL               <a href="http://intranet.somecompany.com/artifacts/sauce-2.7.tgz">http://intranet.somecompany.com/artifacts/sauce-2.7.tgz</a>
                              https://www.somecompany.com/downloads/sauce-2.7.zip
            URL_HASH          MD5=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
            CONFIGURE_COMMAND ""
            BUILD_COMMAND     ${MAKE_EXE} sauce
          )

       Suppose  the build step of <b>secretsauce</b> requires that <b>foobar</b> must already be built. This could be enforced
       like so:

          ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies(secretsauce build foobar)

       Another alternative would be to create a custom target for  <b>foobar</b>'s  build  step  and  make  <b>secretsauce</b>
       depend  on  that  rather than the whole <b>foobar</b> project. This would mean <b>foobar</b> only needs to be built, it
       doesn't need to run its install or test steps before <b>secretsauce</b> can be built. The dependency can also be
       defined along with the <b>secretsauce</b> project:

          ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(foobar build)
          ExternalProject_Add(secretsauce
            URL               <a href="http://intranet.somecompany.com/artifacts/sauce-2.7.tgz">http://intranet.somecompany.com/artifacts/sauce-2.7.tgz</a>
                              https://www.somecompany.com/downloads/sauce-2.7.zip
            URL_HASH          MD5=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
            CONFIGURE_COMMAND ""
            BUILD_COMMAND     ${MAKE_EXE} sauce
            DEPENDS           foobar-build
          )

       Instead of calling <u>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</u>, the target could be defined along with  the  <b>foobar</b>
       project itself:

          ExternalProject_Add(foobar
            GIT_REPOSITORY <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:FooCo/FooBar.git
            GIT_TAG        origin/release/1.2.3
            STEP_TARGETS   build
          )

       If  many  external projects should have the same set of step targets, setting a directory property may be
       more convenient. The <b>build</b> step target could be created  automatically  by  setting  the  <b>EP_STEP_TARGETS</b>
       directory property before creating the external projects with <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>:

          set_property(DIRECTORY PROPERTY EP_STEP_TARGETS build)

       Lastly,  suppose  that <b>secretsauce</b> provides a script called <b>makedoc</b> which can be used to generate its own
       documentation. Further suppose that the script expects the output directory to be provided  as  the  only
       parameter  and  that  it  should be run from the <b>secretsauce</b> source directory. A custom step and a custom
       target to trigger the script can be defined like so:

          ExternalProject_Add_Step(secretsauce docs
            COMMAND           &lt;SOURCE_DIR&gt;/makedoc &lt;BINARY_DIR&gt;
            WORKING_DIRECTORY &lt;SOURCE_DIR&gt;
            COMMENT           "Building secretsauce docs"
            ALWAYS            TRUE
            EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN TRUE
          )
          ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(secretsauce docs)

       The custom step could then be triggered from the main build like so:

          cmake --build . --target secretsauce-docs

   <b>FeatureSummary</b>
       Functions for generating a summary of enabled/disabled features.

       These functions can be used to generate a summary of enabled and disabled packages and/or feature  for  a
       build tree such as:

          -- The following OPTIONAL packages have been found:
          LibXml2 (required version &gt;= 2.4), XML processing lib, &lt;<a href="http://xmlsoft.org">http://xmlsoft.org</a>&gt;
             * Enables HTML-import in MyWordProcessor
             * Enables odt-export in MyWordProcessor
          PNG, A PNG image library., &lt;<a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/</a>&gt;
             * Enables saving screenshots
          -- The following OPTIONAL packages have not been found:
          Lua51, The Lua scripting language., &lt;https://www.lua.org&gt;
             * Enables macros in MyWordProcessor
          Foo, Foo provides cool stuff.

   <b>Global</b> <b>Properties</b>
       <b>FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES</b>

       The global property <u>FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES</u> defines the type of packages used by <u>FeatureSummary</u>.

       The  order in this list is important, the first package type in the list is the least important, the last
       is the most important. the of a package can only be changed to higher types.

       The default package types are , <b>RUNTIME</b>, <b>OPTIONAL</b>, <b>RECOMMENDED</b> and  <b>REQUIRED</b>,  and  their  importance  is
       <b>RUNTIME</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>OPTIONAL</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>RECOMMENDED</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>REQUIRED</b>.

       <b>FeatureSummary_REQUIRED_PKG_TYPES</b>

       The global property <u>FeatureSummary_REQUIRED_PKG_TYPES</u> defines which package types are required.

       If  one  or  more  package  in  this  categories  has  not  been  found,  CMake  will  abort when calling
       <u>feature_summary()</u> with the 'FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES' option enabled.

       The default value for this global property is <b>REQUIRED</b>.

       <b>FeatureSummary_DEFAULT_PKG_TYPE</b>

       The global property <u>FeatureSummary_DEFAULT_PKG_TYPE</u> defines which package type is the default one.   When
       calling  <u>feature_summary()</u>,  if  the  user  did  not set the package type explicitly, the package will be
       assigned to this category.

       This value must be one of the types defined in the <u>FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES</u> global  property  unless  the
       package type is set for all the packages.

       The default value for this global property is <b>OPTIONAL</b>.

       <b>FeatureSummary_&lt;TYPE&gt;_DESCRIPTION</b>

       Added in version 3.9.

       The  global  property  <u>FeatureSummary_&lt;TYPE&gt;_DESCRIPTION</u> can be defined for each type to replace the type
       name with the specified string whenever the package type is used in an output string.

       If not set, the string "<b>&lt;TYPE&gt;</b> packages" is used.

   <b>Functions</b>
       <b>feature_summary</b>

                 feature_summary( [FILENAME &lt;file&gt;]
                                  [APPEND]
                                  [VAR &lt;variable_name&gt;]
                                  [INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES]
                                  [FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES]
                                  [DESCRIPTION "&lt;description&gt;" | DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION]
                                  [QUIET_ON_EMPTY]
                                  WHAT (ALL
                                       | PACKAGES_FOUND | PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
                                       | &lt;TYPE&gt;_PACKAGES_FOUND | &lt;TYPE&gt;_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
                                       | ENABLED_FEATURES | DISABLED_FEATURES)
                                )

              The <b>feature_summary()</b> macro can be used to print information about enabled or disabled packages or
              features of a project.  By default, only the names of the features/packages will  be  printed  and
              their  required  version  when one was specified.  Use <b>set_package_properties()</b> to add more useful
              information, like e.g.  a download URL for the respective package or their purpose in the project.

              The <b>WHAT</b> option is the only mandatory option.  Here you specify what information will be printed:

              <b>ALL</b>    print everything

              <b>ENABLED_FEATURES</b>
                     the list of all features which are enabled

              <b>DISABLED_FEATURES</b>
                     the list of all features which are disabled

              <b>PACKAGES_FOUND</b>
                     the list of all packages which have been found

              <b>PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND</b>
                     the list of all packages which have not been found

              For each package  type  <b>&lt;TYPE&gt;</b>  defined  by  the  <u>FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES</u>  global  property,  the
              following information can also be used:

              <b>&lt;TYPE&gt;_PACKAGES_FOUND</b>
                     only those packages which have been found which have the type &lt;TYPE&gt;

              <b>&lt;TYPE&gt;_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND</b>
                     only those packages which have not been found which have the type &lt;TYPE&gt;

              Changed in version 3.1: With the exception of the <b>ALL</b> value, these values can be combined in order
              to customize the output. For example:

                 feature_summary(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES DISABLED_FEATURES)

              If  a  <b>FILENAME</b>  is  given,  the  information is printed into this file.  If <b>APPEND</b> is used, it is
              appended to this file, otherwise the file is overwritten if it already existed.  If the VAR option
              is used, the information is "printed" into the specified variable.  If <b>FILENAME</b> is not  used,  the
              information  is  printed  to the terminal.  Using the <b>DESCRIPTION</b> option a description or headline
              can be set which will be printed above the actual content.   If  only  one  type  of  package  was
              requested,  no  title  is  printed,  unless it is explicitly set using either <b>DESCRIPTION</b> to use a
              custom string, or <b>DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION</b>  to  use  a  default  title  for  the  requested  type.   If
              <b>INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES</b>  is  given,  packages which have been searched with <b>find_package(...</b> <b>QUIET)</b>
              will also be listed. By default they are skipped.  If <b>FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES</b> is given,
              CMake will abort if a package which  is  marked  as  one  of  the  package  types  listed  in  the
              <u>FeatureSummary_REQUIRED_PKG_TYPES</u>  global  property has not been found.  The default value for the
              <u>FeatureSummary_REQUIRED_PKG_TYPES</u> global property is <b>REQUIRED</b>.

              Added in version 3.9: The <b>DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION</b> option.

              The <u>FeatureSummary_DEFAULT_PKG_TYPE</u> global property can be modified to change the default  package
              type assigned when not explicitly assigned by the user.

              Added  in  version  3.8:  If  the  <b>QUIET_ON_EMPTY</b>  option is used, if only one type of package was
              requested, and no packages belonging to that category were found, then no  output  (including  the
              <b>DESCRIPTION</b>) is printed or added to the <b>VAR</b> variable.

              Example 1, append everything to a file:

                 include(FeatureSummary)
                 feature_summary(WHAT ALL
                                 FILENAME ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/all.log APPEND)

              Example  2,  print  the  enabled  features  into the variable enabledFeaturesText, including QUIET
              packages:

                 include(FeatureSummary)
                 feature_summary(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES
                                 INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES
                                 DESCRIPTION "Enabled Features:"
                                 VAR enabledFeaturesText)
                 message(STATUS "${enabledFeaturesText}")

              Example 3, change default package types and print only the categories that are not empty:

                 include(FeatureSummary)
                 set_property(GLOBAL APPEND PROPERTY FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES BUILD)
                 find_package(FOO)
                 set_package_properties(FOO PROPERTIES TYPE BUILD)
                 feature_summary(WHAT BUILD_PACKAGES_FOUND
                                 Description "Build tools found:"
                                 QUIET_ON_EMPTY)
                 feature_summary(WHAT BUILD_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
                                 Description "Build tools not found:"
                                 QUIET_ON_EMPTY)

       <b>set_package_properties</b>

                 set_package_properties(&lt;name&gt; PROPERTIES
                                        [ URL &lt;url&gt; ]
                                        [ DESCRIPTION &lt;description&gt; ]
                                        [ TYPE (RUNTIME|OPTIONAL|RECOMMENDED|REQUIRED) ]
                                        [ PURPOSE &lt;purpose&gt; ]
                                       )

              Use this macro to set up information about the named package, which  can  then  be  displayed  via
              FEATURE_SUMMARY().   This  can  be done either directly in the Find-module or in the project which
              uses the module after the find_package() call.  The features for which information can be set  are
              added automatically by the find_package() command.

              <b>URL</b> <b>&lt;url&gt;</b>
                     This  should  be  the  homepage  of the package, or something similar.  Ideally this is set
                     already directly in the Find-module.

              <b>DESCRIPTION</b> <b>&lt;description&gt;</b>
                     A short description what that package is, at  most  one  sentence.   Ideally  this  is  set
                     already directly in the Find-module.

              <b>TYPE</b> <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>
                     What  type  of  dependency has the using project on that package.  Default is <b>OPTIONAL</b>.  In
                     this case it is a package which can be used by the project when available at buildtime, but
                     it also work without.  <b>RECOMMENDED</b> is similar to <b>OPTIONAL</b>, i.e.  the project will build  if
                     the  package  is  not  present,  but  the  functionality  of the resulting binaries will be
                     severely limited.  If a <b>REQUIRED</b> package is not available at buildtime, the project may not
                     even build.  This can be combined with the <b>FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES</b> argument  for
                     <b>feature_summary()</b>.   Last, a <b>RUNTIME</b> package is a package which is actually not used at all
                     during the build, but which is required for actually running the resulting binaries.  So if
                     such a package is missing, the project can still be built, but it may not  work  later  on.
                     If  <b>set_package_properties()</b>  is  called multiple times for the same package with different
                     TYPEs, the <b>TYPE</b> is only changed to  higher  TYPEs  (<b>RUNTIME</b>  <b>&lt;</b>  <b>OPTIONAL</b>  <b>&lt;</b>  <b>RECOMMENDED</b>  <b>&lt;</b>
                     <b>REQUIRED</b>), lower TYPEs are ignored.  The <b>TYPE</b> property is project-specific, so it cannot be
                     set  by  the  Find-module, but must be set in the project.  Type accepted can be changed by
                     setting the <u>FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES</u> global property.

              <b>PURPOSE</b> <b>&lt;purpose&gt;</b>
                     This describes which features this package enables in the project, i.e.  it tells the  user
                     what  functionality  he  gets  in  the  resulting binaries.  If set_package_properties() is
                     called multiple times for a package, all PURPOSE properties  are  appended  to  a  list  of
                     purposes of the package in the project.  As the TYPE property, also the PURPOSE property is
                     project-specific, so it cannot be set by the Find-module, but must be set in the project.

              Example for setting the info for a package:

                 find_package(LibXml2)
                 set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES
                                        DESCRIPTION "A XML processing library."
                                        URL "<a href="http://xmlsoft.org/">http://xmlsoft.org/</a>")
                 # or
                 set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES
                                        TYPE RECOMMENDED
                                        PURPOSE "Enables HTML-import in MyWordProcessor")
                 # or
                 set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES
                                        TYPE OPTIONAL
                                        PURPOSE "Enables odt-export in MyWordProcessor")

       <b>add_feature_info</b>

                 add_feature_info(&lt;name&gt; &lt;enabled&gt; &lt;description&gt;)

              Use  this  macro  to  add  information  about a feature with the given <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>.  <b>&lt;enabled&gt;</b> contains
              whether this feature is  enabled  or  not.  It  can  be  a  variable  or  a  list  of  conditions.
              <b>&lt;description&gt;</b>  is  a  text  describing  the  feature.   The  information  can  be  displayed using
              <b>feature_summary()</b> for <b>ENABLED_FEATURES</b> and <b>DISABLED_FEATURES</b> respectively.

              Changed in version 3.8: <b>&lt;enabled&gt;</b> can be a list of conditions.

              Example for setting the info for a feature:

                 option(WITH_FOO "Help for foo" ON)
                 add_feature_info(Foo WITH_FOO "The Foo feature provides very cool stuff.")

   <b>Legacy</b> <b>Macros</b>
       The following macros are provided for compatibility with previous CMake versions:

       <b>set_package_info</b>

                 set_package_info(&lt;name&gt; &lt;description&gt; [ &lt;url&gt; [&lt;purpose&gt;] ])

              Use this macro to set up information about the named package, which  can  then  be  displayed  via
              <b>feature_summary()</b>.   This  can  be done either directly in the Find-module or in the project which
              uses the module after the <u>find_package()</u> call.  The features for which information can be set  are
              added automatically by the <b>find_package()</b> command.

       <b>set_feature_info</b>

                 set_feature_info(&lt;name&gt; &lt;description&gt; [&lt;url&gt;])

              Does the same as:

                 set_package_info(&lt;name&gt; &lt;description&gt; &lt;url&gt;)

       <b>print_enabled_features</b>

                 print_enabled_features()

              Does the same as

                 feature_summary(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES DESCRIPTION "Enabled features:")

       <b>print_disabled_features</b>

                 print_disabled_features()

              Does the same as

                 feature_summary(WHAT DISABLED_FEATURES DESCRIPTION "Disabled features:")

   <b>FetchContent</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The  <u>Using</u>  <u>Dependencies</u> <u>Guide</u> provides a high-level introduction to this general topic. It provides a
          broader overview of where the  <b>FetchContent</b>  module  fits  into  the  bigger  picture,  including  its
          relationship  to the <u>find_package()</u> command.  The guide is recommended pre-reading before moving on to
          the details below.

   <b>Overview</b>
       This module enables populating content at configure time via any method supported by the  <u>ExternalProject</u>
       module.   Whereas  <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>  downloads  at build time, the <b>FetchContent</b> module makes content
       available  immediately,  allowing  the  configure  step   to   use   the   content   in   commands   like
       <u>add_subdirectory()</u>, <u>include()</u> or <u>file()</u> operations.

       Content  population  details  should  be  defined  separately  from  the command that performs the actual
       population.  This separation ensures that all the dependency details are defined  before  anything  might
       try  to use them to populate content.  This is particularly important in more complex project hierarchies
       where dependencies may be shared between multiple projects.

       The following shows a typical example of  declaring  content  details  for  some  dependencies  and  then
       ensuring they are populated with a separate call:

          FetchContent_Declare(
            googletest
            GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
            GIT_TAG        703bd9caab50b139428cea1aaff9974ebee5742e # release-1.10.0
          )
          FetchContent_Declare(
            myCompanyIcons
            URL      https://intranet.mycompany.com/assets/iconset_1.12.tar.gz
            URL_HASH MD5=5588a7b18261c20068beabfb4f530b87
          )

          FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest myCompanyIcons)

       The <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> command ensures the named dependencies have been populated, either by an
       earlier call, or by populating them itself.  When performing the population, it will also add them to the
       main  build,  if  possible, so that the main build can use the populated projects' targets, etc.  See the
       command's documentation for how these steps are performed.

       When using a hierarchical project arrangement, projects at higher levels in the  hierarchy  are  able  to
       override  the  declared  details of content specified anywhere lower in the project hierarchy.  The first
       details to be declared for a given dependency  take  precedence,  regardless  of  where  in  the  project
       hierarchy  that  occurs.   Similarly,  the  first  call  that tries to populate a dependency "wins", with
       subsequent populations reusing the result of the first instead of repeating the  population  again.   See
       the <u>Examples</u> which demonstrate this scenario.

       The <b>FetchContent</b> module also supports defining and populating content in a single call, with no check for
       whether  the  content has been populated elsewhere already.  This should not be done in projects, but may
       be appropriate for populating content in <u>CMake</u> <u>script</u> <u>mode</u>.  See <u>FetchContent_Populate()</u> for details.

   <b>Commands</b>
       <b>FetchContent_Declare</b>

                 FetchContent_Declare(
                   &lt;name&gt;
                   &lt;contentOptions&gt;...
                   [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
                   [SYSTEM]
                   [OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE |
                    FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS args...]
                 )

              The <b>FetchContent_Declare()</b> function  records  the  options  that  describe  how  to  populate  the
              specified content.  If such details have already been recorded earlier in this project (regardless
              of  where  in  the  project  hierarchy),  this and all later calls for the same content <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> are
              ignored.  This "first to record, wins" approach is  what  allows  hierarchical  projects  to  have
              parent projects override content details of child projects.

              The  content  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>  can  be  any  string  without spaces, but good practice would be to use only
              letters, numbers, and underscores.  The name will be treated case-insensitively, and it should  be
              obvious  for  the  content  it represents. It is often the name of the child project, or the value
              given to its top level <u>project()</u> command (if it  is  a  CMake  project).   For  well-known  public
              projects, the name should generally be the official name of the project.  Choosing an unusual name
              makes it unlikely that other projects needing that same content will use the same name, leading to
              the content being populated multiple times.

              The   <b>&lt;contentOptions&gt;</b>   can   be  any  of  the  download,  update,  or  patch  options  that  the
              <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u> command understands.  The configure, build,  install,  and  test  steps  are
              explicitly  disabled, so options related to those steps will be ignored.  The <b>SOURCE_SUBDIR</b> option
              is an exception, see <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> for details on how that affects behavior.

              Changed  in  version  3.30:  When  policy  <u>CMP0168</u>  is  set  to  <b>NEW</b>,  some   output-related   and
              directory-related options are ignored.  See the policy documentation for details.

              In  most cases, <b>&lt;contentOptions&gt;</b> will just be a couple of options defining the download method and
              method-specific details like a commit tag or archive hash.  For example:

                 FetchContent_Declare(
                   googletest
                   GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
                   GIT_TAG        703bd9caab50b139428cea1aaff9974ebee5742e # release-1.10.0
                 )

                 FetchContent_Declare(
                   myCompanyIcons
                   URL      https://intranet.mycompany.com/assets/iconset_1.12.tar.gz
                   URL_HASH MD5=5588a7b18261c20068beabfb4f530b87
                 )

                 FetchContent_Declare(
                   myCompanyCertificates
                   SVN_REPOSITORY svn+ssh://svn.mycompany.com/srv/svn/trunk/certs
                   SVN_REVISION   -r12345
                 )

              Where contents are being fetched from a remote location and you do not control that server, it  is
              advisable  to  use  a  hash  for  <b>GIT_TAG</b> rather than a branch or tag name.  A commit hash is more
              secure and helps to confirm that the downloaded contents are what you expected.

              Changed in version 3.14: Commands for  the  download,  update,  or  patch  steps  can  access  the
              terminal.   This  may  be  needed for things like password prompts or real-time display of command
              progress.

              Added in version 3.22: The <u>CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY</u>, <u>CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO</u>, <u>CMAKE_NETRC</u>,  and  <u>CMAKE_NETRC_FILE</u>
              variables  now provide the defaults for their corresponding content options, just like they do for
              <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>. Previously, these variables were ignored by the <b>FetchContent</b> module.

              Added in version 3.24:

              <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b>
                     This option is for scenarios where the <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> command may first try a
                     call to <u>find_package()</u> to satisfy the dependency for <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>.  By default, such a call would
                     be simply <b>find_package(&lt;name&gt;)</b>, but <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b> can be  used  to  provide  additional
                     arguments  to  be  appended  after  the  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>.   <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b> can also be given with
                     nothing  after  it,  which  indicates  that  <u>find_package()</u>  can   still   be   called   if
                     <u>FETCHCONTENT_TRY_FIND_PACKAGE_MODE</u> is set to <b>OPT_IN</b>, or is not set.

                     It would not normally be appropriate to specify <b>REQUIRED</b> as one of the additional arguments
                     after <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b>.  Doing so would mean the <u>find_package()</u> call must succeed, so none
                     of  the other details specified in the <b>FetchContent_Declare()</b> call would get a chance to be
                     used as a fall-back.

                     Everything after the <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b> keyword is appended to the <u>find_package()</u>  call,  so
                     all  other  <b>&lt;contentOptions&gt;</b>  must  come  before  the  <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b>  keyword.   If the
                     <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_TARGETS_GLOBAL</u>   variable   is    set    to    true    at    the    time
                     <b>FetchContent_Declare()</b>  is  called, a <b>GLOBAL</b> keyword will be appended to the <u>find_package()</u>
                     arguments if it was not already specified.  It will also be appended  if  <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b>
                     was not given, but <u>FETCHCONTENT_TRY_FIND_PACKAGE_MODE</u> was set to <b>ALWAYS</b>.

                     <b>OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE</b> cannot be used when <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b> is given.

                     <u>Dependency</u>  <u>Providers</u>  discusses another way that <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> calls can be
                     redirected.   <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b>  is  intended  for  project  control,  whereas   dependency
                     providers allow users to override project behavior.

              <b>OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE</b>
                     When  a  <b>FetchContent_Declare(&lt;name&gt;</b>  <b>...)</b>  call  includes this option, subsequent calls to
                     <b>find_package(&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>...)</b>  will  ensure  that  <b>FetchContent_MakeAvailable(&lt;name&gt;)</b>  has  been
                     called, then use the config package files in the <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR</u> directory
                     (which  are  usually  created  by  <b>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</b>).   This  effectively makes
                     <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> override <u>find_package()</u> for the named dependency, allowing the
                     former to satisfy the package requirements of the latter.  <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b> cannot be used
                     when <b>OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE</b> is given.

                     If a <u>dependency</u> <u>provider</u> has been set and the project calls <u>find_package()</u> for  the  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
                     dependency,  <b>OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE</b>  will  not  prevent  the provider from seeing that call.
                     Dependency  providers  always  have  the  opportunity  to  intercept  any  direct  call  to
                     <u>find_package()</u>, except if that call contains the <b>BYPASS_PROVIDER</b> option.

              Added in version 3.25:

              <b>SYSTEM</b> If  the  <b>SYSTEM</b> argument is provided, the <u>SYSTEM</u> directory property of a subdirectory added
                     by <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> will be set to true.  This will affect non-imported targets
                     created as part of that command.  See the <u>SYSTEM</u> target property documentation for  a  more
                     detailed discussion of the effects.

              Added in version 3.28:

              <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b>
                     If  the  <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b>  argument  is provided, then targets in the subdirectory added by
                     <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> will not be included in the <b>ALL</b> target by default, and may  be
                     excluded  from  IDE  project  files.  See  the  documentation  for  the  directory property
                     <u>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</u> for a detailed discussion of the effects.

       <b>FetchContent_MakeAvailable</b>
              Added in version 3.14.

                 FetchContent_MakeAvailable(&lt;name1&gt; [&lt;name2&gt;...])

              This command ensures that each of the named dependencies are made available to the project by  the
              time  it  returns.  There must have been a call to <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u> for each dependency, and
              the first such call will control how that dependency will be made available, as described below.

              If <b>&lt;lowercaseName&gt;_SOURCE_DIR</b> is not set:

              • Added in version 3.24: If a <u>dependency</u>  <u>provider</u>  is  set,  call  the  provider's  command  with
                <b>FETCHCONTENT_MAKEAVAILABLE_SERIAL</b>  as the first argument, followed by the arguments of the first
                call to <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u> for <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>.  If <b>SOURCE_DIR</b> or <b>BINARY_DIR</b> were  not  part  of  the
                original   declared   arguments,   they   will   be   added   with  their  default  values.   If
                <u>FETCHCONTENT_TRY_FIND_PACKAGE_MODE</u> was  set  to  <b>NEVER</b>  when  the  details  were  declared,  any
                <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b>  will  be  omitted.  The <b>OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE</b> keyword is also always omitted.
                If  the  provider  fulfilled  the  request,  <b>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</b>  will  consider   that
                dependency  handled,  skip  the remaining steps below, and move on to the next dependency in the
                list.

              • Added in version 3.24: If permitted, <u>find_package(&lt;name&gt;</u> <u>[&lt;args&gt;...])</u>   will  be  called,  where
                <b>&lt;args&gt;...</b>  may be provided by the <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b> option in <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u>.  The value
                of the <u>FETCHCONTENT_TRY_FIND_PACKAGE_MODE</u> variable at the time <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u> was called
                determines   whether   <b>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</b>   can   call   <u>find_package()</u>.     If    the
                <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_TARGETS_GLOBAL</u>  variable  is set to true when <b>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</b> is
                called, it still affects any imported targets created when that in  turn  calls  <u>find_package()</u>,
                even if that variable was false when the corresponding details were declared.

              If   the   dependency   was   not   satisfied   by   a   provider   or   a   <u>find_package()</u>  call,
              <b>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</b> then uses the following logic to make the dependency available:

              • If  the   dependency   has   already   been   populated   earlier   in   this   run,   set   the
                <b>&lt;lowercaseName&gt;_POPULATED</b>,  <b>&lt;lowercaseName&gt;_SOURCE_DIR</b>, and <b>&lt;lowercaseName&gt;_BINARY_DIR</b> variables
                in the same way as a call to <u>FetchContent_GetProperties()</u>, then skip the remaining  steps  below
                and move on to the next dependency in the list.

              • Populate the dependency using the details recorded by an earlier call to <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u>.
                Halt     with    a    fatal    error    if    no    such    details    have    been    recorded.
                <u>FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_&lt;uppercaseName&gt;</u> can be used to override the  declared  details  and  use
                content provided at the specified location instead.

              • Added  in  version  3.24:  Ensure  the  <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR</u>  directory  contains  a
                <b>&lt;lowercaseName&gt;-config.cmake</b> and a <b>&lt;lowercaseName&gt;-config-version.cmake</b> file  (or  equivalently,
                <b>&lt;name&gt;Config.cmake</b>     and     <b>&lt;name&gt;ConfigVersion.cmake</b>).      The     directory    that    the
                <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR</u> variable points to is cleared at the start of every CMake  run.
                If  no  config  file  exists after populating the dependency in the previous step, a minimal one
                will be written which <u>includes</u> any <b>&lt;lowercaseName&gt;-extra.cmake</b> or  <b>&lt;name&gt;Extra.cmake</b>  file  with
                the  <b>OPTIONAL</b> flag (so the files can be missing and won't generate a warning).  Similarly, if no
                config   version   file   exists,   a   very   simple   one   will   be   written   which   sets
                <b>PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE</b>  and <b>PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT</b> to true.  This ensures all future calls to
                <u>find_package()</u> for the dependency will use the redirected config file, regardless of any version
                requirements.  CMake cannot automatically determine an arbitrary  dependency's  version,  so  it
                cannot  set  <b>PACKAGE_VERSION</b>.  When a dependency is pulled in via <u>add_subdirectory()</u> in the next
                step,   it   may   choose   to   overwrite   the    generated    config    version    file    in
                <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR</u>  with  one  that also sets <b>PACKAGE_VERSION</b>.  The dependency may
                also write a <b>&lt;lowercaseName&gt;-extra.cmake</b> or <b>&lt;name&gt;Extra.cmake</b> file to perform custom processing,
                or define any variables that their  normal  (installed)  package  config  file  would  otherwise
                usually  define (many projects don't do any custom processing or set any variables and therefore
                have no need to do this).  If required, the main project can write these files  instead  if  the
                dependency  project  doesn't  do  so.   This allows the main project to add missing details from
                older dependencies that haven't  or  can't  be  updated  to  support  this  functionality.   See
                <u>Integrating</u> <u>With</u> <u>find_package()</u> for examples.

              • If   the   top  directory  of  the  populated  content  contains  a  <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>  file,  call
                <u>add_subdirectory()</u> to add it to the main build.   It  is  not  an  error  for  there  to  be  no
                <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>  file,  which allows the command to be used for dependencies that make downloaded
                content available at a known location, but which do not need or support being added directly  to
                the build.

                Added  in  version  3.18:  The <b>SOURCE_SUBDIR</b> option can be given in the declared details to look
                somewhere below the top directory instead (i.e. the same way that <b>SOURCE_SUBDIR</b> is used  by  the
                <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>  command).   The path provided with <b>SOURCE_SUBDIR</b> must be relative, and it
                will be treated as relative to the top directory.  It can also point to a  directory  that  does
                not  contain a <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file, or even to a directory that doesn't exist.  This can be used
                to avoid adding a project that contains a <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file in its top directory.

                Added in version 3.25: If the <b>SYSTEM</b> keyword was included in the call to <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u>,
                the <b>SYSTEM</b> keyword will be added to the <u>add_subdirectory()</u> command.

                Added  in  version  3.28:  If  the  <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b>  keyword  was  included  in  the  call   to
                <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u>,  the  <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b>  keyword  will be added to the <u>add_subdirectory()</u>
                command.

                Added in version 3.29: <u>CMAKE_EXPORT_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME</u> is  set  to  the  dependency  name  before
                calling <u>add_subdirectory()</u>.

              Projects  should  aim  to  declare the details of all dependencies they might use before they call
              <b>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</b> for any of them.  This ensures that if any of  the  dependencies  are
              also  sub-dependencies  of  one or more of the others, the main project still controls the details
              that will be used (because it will declare them first before the dependencies get  a  chance  to).
              In the following code samples, assume that the <b>uses_other</b> dependency also uses <b>FetchContent</b> to add
              the <b>other</b> dependency internally:

                 # WRONG: Should declare all details first
                 FetchContent_Declare(uses_other ...)
                 FetchContent_MakeAvailable(uses_other)

                 FetchContent_Declare(other ...)    # Will be ignored, uses_other beat us to it
                 FetchContent_MakeAvailable(other)  # Would use details declared by uses_other

                 # CORRECT: All details declared first, so they will take priority
                 FetchContent_Declare(uses_other ...)
                 FetchContent_Declare(other ...)
                 FetchContent_MakeAvailable(uses_other other)

              Note   that   <u>CMAKE_VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS</u>   is  explicitly  set  to  false  upon  entry  to
              <b>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</b>, and is restored to its original value before  the  command  returns.
              Developers  typically  only  want  to verify header sets from the main project, not those from any
              dependencies.  This local manipulation of the <u>CMAKE_VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS</u> variable provides
              that   intuitive   behavior.    You   can   use   variables    like    <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE</u>    or
              <u>CMAKE_PROJECT_&lt;PROJECT-NAME&gt;_INCLUDE</u>  to  turn  verification back on for all or some dependencies.
              You can also set the <u>VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS</u> property of individual targets.

       <b>FetchContent_Populate</b>
              The <b>FetchContent_Populate()</b> command is a self-contained call which can be used to perform  content
              population  as  an  isolated  operation.   It  is rarely the right command to use, projects should
              almost always use <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u> and <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> instead.  The  main  use
              case for <b>FetchContent_Populate()</b> is in <u>CMake</u> <u>script</u> <u>mode</u> as part of implementing some other higher
              level custom feature.

                 FetchContent_Populate(
                   &lt;name&gt;
                   [QUIET]
                   [SUBBUILD_DIR &lt;subBuildDir&gt;]
                   [SOURCE_DIR &lt;srcDir&gt;]
                   [BINARY_DIR &lt;binDir&gt;]
                   ...
                 )

              At  least one option must be specified after <u>&lt;name&gt;</u>, otherwise the call is interpreted differently
              (see <u>below</u>).  The supported  options  for  <b>FetchContent_Populate()</b>  are  the  same  as  those  for
              <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u>,  with  a few exceptions. The following do not relate to populating content
              with <b>FetchContent_Populate()</b> and therefore are not supported:

              • <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b>

              • <b>SYSTEM</b>

              • <b>OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE</b>

              • <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b>

              The few options shown in the signature above are either specific  to  <b>FetchContent_Populate()</b>,  or
              their behavior is slightly modified from how <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u> treats them:

              <b>QUIET</b>  The  <b>QUIET</b>  option can be given to hide the output associated with populating the specified
                     content.  If the population fails, the output will be  shown  regardless  of  whether  this
                     option  was  given  or  not  so  that  the  cause  of  the  failure  can be diagnosed.  The
                     <u>FETCHCONTENT_QUIET</u> variable has no effect on <b>FetchContent_Populate()</b>  calls  of  this  form
                     where the content details are provided directly.

                     Changed  in  version  3.30: The <b>QUIET</b> option and <u>FETCHCONTENT_QUIET</u> variable have no effect
                     when policy <u>CMP0168</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>. The output is still quiet by default in that  case,  but
                     verbosity  is  controlled  by  the  message  logging level (see <u>CMAKE_MESSAGE_LOG_LEVEL</u> and
                     <u>--log-level</u>).

              <b>SUBBUILD_DIR</b>
                     The <b>SUBBUILD_DIR</b> argument can be provided to change the location of the  sub-build  created
                     to        perform       the       population.        The       default       value       is
                     <b>${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/&lt;lowercaseName&gt;-subbuild</b>, and it would be unusual  to  need  to
                     override this default.  If a relative path is specified, it will be interpreted as relative
                     to  <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u>.   This  option  should not be confused with the <b>SOURCE_SUBDIR</b>
                     option, which only affects the <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> command.

                     Changed in version 3.30: <b>SUBBUILD_DIR</b> is ignored when policy <u>CMP0168</u> is set to  <b>NEW</b>,  since
                     there is no sub-build in that case.

              <b>SOURCE_DIR,</b> <b>BINARY_DIR</b>
                     The  <b>SOURCE_DIR</b>  and  <b>BINARY_DIR</b>  arguments  are  supported  by  <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>, but
                     different default values are  used  by  <b>FetchContent_Populate()</b>.   <b>SOURCE_DIR</b>  defaults  to
                     <b>${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/&lt;lowercaseName&gt;-src</b>,     and     <b>BINARY_DIR</b>     defaults     to
                     <b>${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/&lt;lowercaseName&gt;-build</b>.  If a relative  path  is  specified,  it
                     will be interpreted as relative to <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u>.

              In  addition  to  the  above  explicit  options, any other unrecognized options are passed through
              unmodified to <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u> to  set  up  the  download,  patch,  and  update  steps.   The
              following  options  are  explicitly  prohibited  (they are disabled by the <b>FetchContent_Populate()</b>
              command):

              • <b>CONFIGURE_COMMAND</b>

              • <b>BUILD_COMMAND</b>

              • <b>INSTALL_COMMAND</b>

              • <b>TEST_COMMAND</b>

              With  this  form,  the   <u>FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED</u>   and   <u>FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED</u>
              variables and policy <u>CMP0170</u> are ignored.

              When  this  form  of  <b>FetchContent_Populate()</b>  returns, the following variables will be set in the
              scope of the caller:

              <b>&lt;lowercaseName&gt;_SOURCE_DIR</b>
                     The location where the populated content can be found upon return.

              <b>&lt;lowercaseName&gt;_BINARY_DIR</b>
                     A directory originally intended for use as a corresponding build directory, but is unlikely
                     to be relevant when using this form of the command.

              If using <b>FetchContent_Populate()</b> within <u>CMake</u> <u>script</u> <u>mode</u>, be aware that the  implementation  sets
              up a sub-build which therefore requires a CMake generator and build tool to be available. If these
              cannot  be  found  by  default,  then  the  <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR</u> and potentially the <u>CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM</u>
              variables will need to be set appropriately on the command line invoking the script.

              Changed in version 3.30: If policy <u>CMP0168</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>, no  sub-build  is  used.   Within  <u>CMake</u>
              <u>script</u>  <u>mode</u>,  that  allows  <b>FetchContent_Populate()</b>  to be called without any build tool or CMake
              generator.

              Added in version 3.18: Added support for the <b>DOWNLOAD_NO_EXTRACT</b> option.

          The command supports another form, although it should no longer be used:

              FetchContent_Populate(&lt;name&gt;)

          Changed in version 3.30: This form is deprecated. Policy <u>CMP0169</u> provides backward  compatibility  for
          projects   that   still   need   to   use   this   form,   but  projects  should  be  updated  to  use
          <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> instead.

          In this form, the only argument given to <b>FetchContent_Populate()</b> is the <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>.  When used  this  way,
          the   command   assumes   the   content   details   have   been   recorded   by  an  earlier  call  to
          <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u>.  The details are stored in a global property, so they are unaffected by things
          like variable or directory scope.  Therefore, it doesn't matter where in the project the details  were
          previously  declared,  as  long as they have been declared before the call to <b>FetchContent_Populate()</b>.
          Those  saved  details  are  then  used  to  populate   the   content   using   a   method   based   on
          <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u> (see policy <u>CMP0168</u> for important behavioral aspects of how that is done).

          When this form of <b>FetchContent_Populate()</b> returns, the following variables will be set in the scope of
          the caller:

          <b>&lt;lowercaseName&gt;_POPULATED</b>
                 This will always be set to <b>TRUE</b> by the call.

          <b>&lt;lowercaseName&gt;_SOURCE_DIR</b>
                 The location where the populated content can be found upon return.

          <b>&lt;lowercaseName&gt;_BINARY_DIR</b>
                 A directory intended for use as a corresponding build directory.

          The  values  of the three variables can also be retrieved from anywhere in the project hierarchy using
          the <u>FetchContent_GetProperties()</u> command.

          The implementation ensures that if the content has already been populated in  a  previous  CMake  run,
          that  content  will  be  reused  rather than repopulating again.  For the common case where population
          involves downloading content, the cost of the download is only paid once. But note that it is an error
          to call <b>FetchContent_Populate(&lt;name&gt;)</b> with the same <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> more than once within a single  CMake  run.
          See  <u>FetchContent_GetProperties()</u>  for  how  to  determine  if population of a <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> has already been
          performed in the current run.

       <b>FetchContent_GetProperties</b>
              When   using   saved   content   details,    a    call    to    <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u>    or
              <u>FetchContent_Populate()</u> records information in global properties which can be queried at any time.
              This  information  may  include the source and binary directories associated with the content, and
              also whether or not the content population has been processed during the current configure run.

                 FetchContent_GetProperties(
                   &lt;name&gt;
                   [SOURCE_DIR &lt;srcDirVar&gt;]
                   [BINARY_DIR &lt;binDirVar&gt;]
                   [POPULATED &lt;doneVar&gt;]
                 )

              The <b>SOURCE_DIR</b>, <b>BINARY_DIR</b>, and <b>POPULATED</b> options can be used to specify which  properties  should
              be  retrieved.   Each  option  accepts a value which is the name of the variable in which to store
              that property.  Most of the time though, only <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> is given, in which case the  call  will  then
              set    the    same    variables    as    a    call    to    <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable(name)</u>    or
              <u>FetchContent_Populate(name)</u>.  Note that the <b>SOURCE_DIR</b> and <b>BINARY_DIR</b> values can be empty  if  the
              call is fulfilled by a <u>dependency</u> <u>provider</u>.

              This  command  is rarely needed when using <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u>.  It is more commonly used
              as part of implementing the deprecated pattern with <u>FetchContent_Populate()</u>,  which  ensures  that
              the relevant variables will always be defined regardless of whether or not the population has been
              performed elsewhere in the project already:

                 # WARNING: This pattern is deprecated, don't use it!
                 #
                 # Check if population has already been performed
                 FetchContent_GetProperties(depname)
                 if(NOT depname_POPULATED)
                   # Fetch the content using previously declared details
                   FetchContent_Populate(depname)

                   # Set custom variables, policies, etc.
                   # ...

                   # Bring the populated content into the build
                   add_subdirectory(${depname_SOURCE_DIR} ${depname_BINARY_DIR})
                 endif()

       <b>FetchContent_SetPopulated</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This command should only be called by <u>dependency</u> <u>providers</u>.  Calling it in any other context is
                 unsupported and future CMake versions may halt with a fatal error in such cases.

                 FetchContent_SetPopulated(
                   &lt;name&gt;
                   [SOURCE_DIR &lt;srcDir&gt;]
                   [BINARY_DIR &lt;binDir&gt;]
                 )

              If  a  provider  command  fulfills  a <b>FETCHCONTENT_MAKEAVAILABLE_SERIAL</b> request, it must call this
              function before returning.  The <b>SOURCE_DIR</b> and <b>BINARY_DIR</b> arguments can be  used  to  specify  the
              values  that  <u>FetchContent_GetProperties()</u>  should  return  for its corresponding arguments.  Only
              provide <b>SOURCE_DIR</b> and <b>BINARY_DIR</b> if they have the same meaning as if they had been  populated  by
              the built-in <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> implementation.

   <b>Variables</b>
       A  number  of cache variables can influence the behavior where details from a <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u> call
       are used to populate content.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          All of these variables are intended for the developer to customize behavior.  They should not normally
          be set by the project.

       <b>FETCHCONTENT_BASE_DIR</b>
              In most cases, the saved details do not specify any options relating to the directories to use for
              the internal sub-build, final source, and build areas.   It  is  generally  best  to  leave  these
              decisions   up   to   the   <b>FetchContent</b>   module   to   handle  on  the  project's  behalf.   The
              <b>FETCHCONTENT_BASE_DIR</b> cache variable  controls  the  point  under  which  all  content  population
              directories  are  collected,  but  in  most  cases, developers would not need to change this.  The
              default location is <b>${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/_deps</b>, but if developers change this  value,  they  should
              aim  to  keep  the path short and just below the top level of the build tree to avoid running into
              path length problems on Windows.

       <b>FETCHCONTENT_QUIET</b>
              The logging output during population can be quite verbose, making the configure stage quite noisy.
              This cache option (<b>ON</b> by default) hides all population output unless an error is encountered.   If
              experiencing problems with hung downloads, temporarily switching this option off may help diagnose
              which content population is causing the issue.

              Changed  in  version  3.30:  <b>FETCHCONTENT_QUIET</b>  is  ignored if policy <u>CMP0168</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>.  The
              output is still quiet by default in that case, but verbosity is controlled by the message  logging
              level (see <u>CMAKE_MESSAGE_LOG_LEVEL</u> and <u>--log-level</u>).

       <b>FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED</b>
              When  this option is enabled, no attempt is made to download or update any content.  It is assumed
              that all content has already been populated in a previous run, or the source directories have been
              pointed at existing contents the developer has provided manually (using options described  further
              below).   When  the developer knows that no changes have been made to any content details, turning
              this option <b>ON</b> can speed up the configure stage.  It is <b>OFF</b> by default.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 The <b>FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED</b> variable is not an appropriate way to prevent  any  network
                 access  on the first run in a build directory.  Doing so can break projects, lead to misleading
                 error messages, and hide subtle population failures.  This variable is specifically intended to
                 only be turned on <u>after</u> the first time CMake has been run.  If  you  want  to  prevent  network
                 access  even on the first run, use a <u>dependency</u> <u>provider</u> and populate the dependency from local
                 content instead.

              Changed in version 3.30: The constraint that the source directory has already been populated  when
              <b>FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED</b> is true is now enforced.  See policy <u>CMP0170</u>.

       <b>FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED</b>
              This  is  a  less  severe  download/update  control  compared  to <u>FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED</u>.
              Instead of  bypassing  all  download  and  update  logic,  <b>FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED</b>  only
              prevents  the  update  step  from  making  connections  to remote servers when using the git or hg
              download methods.  Updates still occur if details about the update step change, but the update  is
              attempted  with only the information already available locally (so switching to a different tag or
              commit that is already fetched locally will succeed, but switching to an unknown commit hash  will
              fail).   The  download  step is not affected, so if content has not been downloaded previously, it
              will still be downloaded when this option is enabled.  This can speed up the configure  step,  but
              not  as  much  as  <u>FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED</u>.   <b>FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED</b>  is <b>OFF</b> by
              default.

       <b>FETCHCONTENT_TRY_FIND_PACKAGE_MODE</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              This variable modifies the details that <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u> records  for  a  given  dependency.
              While  it  ultimately  controls the behavior of <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u>, it is the variable's
              value when <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u> is called that gets used.   It  makes  no  difference  what  the
              variable is set to when <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> is called.  Since the variable should only be
              set  by  the  user  and not by projects directly, it will typically have the same value throughout
              anyway, so this distinction is not usually noticeable.

              <b>FETCHCONTENT_TRY_FIND_PACKAGE_MODE</b> ultimately  controls  whether  <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u>  is
              allowed  to  call  <u>find_package()</u>  to satisfy a dependency.  The variable can be set to one of the
              following values:

              <b>OPT_IN</b> <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> will only call <u>find_package()</u>  if  the  <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u>
                     call  included  a  <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b>  keyword.   This  is  also  the  default  behavior  if
                     <b>FETCHCONTENT_TRY_FIND_PACKAGE_MODE</b> is not set.

              <b>ALWAYS</b> <u>find_package()</u> can be called by  <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u>  regardless  of  whether  the
                     <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u>   call   included   a  <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b>  keyword  or  not.   If  no
                     <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b> keyword was given, the behavior will be as though  <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b>  had
                     been provided, with no additional arguments after it.

              <b>NEVER</b>  <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u>  will not call <u>find_package()</u>.  Any <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b> given to
                     the <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u> call will be ignored.

              As a special case, if the <u>FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_&lt;uppercaseName&gt;</u> variable has a  non-empty  value
              for  a  dependency,  it  is  assumed  that the user is overriding all other methods of making that
              dependency available.  <b>FETCHCONTENT_TRY_FIND_PACKAGE_MODE</b> will have no effect on  that  dependency
              and <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u> will not try to call <u>find_package()</u> for it.

       In addition to the above, the following variables are also defined for each content name:

       <b>FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_&lt;uppercaseName&gt;</b>
              If  this  is  set,  no  download  or  update steps are performed for the specified content and the
              <b>&lt;lowercaseName&gt;_SOURCE_DIR</b> variable returned to the caller is  pointed  at  this  location.   This
              gives  developers  a  way  to  have a separate checkout of the content that they can modify freely
              without interference from the build.  The build simply uses that existing  source,  but  it  still
              defines  <b>&lt;lowercaseName&gt;_BINARY_DIR</b>  to  point inside its own build area.  Developers are strongly
              encouraged to use this mechanism  rather  than  editing  the  sources  populated  in  the  default
              location,  as  changes  to  sources  in  the  default location can be lost when content population
              details are changed by the project.

       <b>FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED_&lt;uppercaseName&gt;</b>
              This is the per-content equivalent of <u>FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED</u>.  If the global option  or
              this  option  is  <b>ON</b>,  then updates for the git and hg methods will not contact any remote for the
              named content.  They will only use information already available locally.  Disabling  updates  for
              individual  content  can  be  useful  for content whose details rarely change, while still leaving
              other frequently changing content with updates enabled.

   <b>Examples</b>
   <b>Typical</b> <b>Case</b>
       This first fairly straightforward example ensures that some popular testing frameworks are  available  to
       the main build:

          include(FetchContent)
          FetchContent_Declare(
            googletest
            GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
            GIT_TAG        703bd9caab50b139428cea1aaff9974ebee5742e # release-1.10.0
          )
          FetchContent_Declare(
            Catch2
            GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git
            GIT_TAG        605a34765aa5d5ecbf476b4598a862ada971b0cc # v3.0.1
          )

          # After the following call, the CMake targets defined by googletest and
          # Catch2 will be available to the rest of the build
          FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest Catch2)

   <b>Integrating</b> <b>With</b> <b>find_package()</b>
       For  the  previous  example,  if  the user wanted to try to find <b>googletest</b> and <b>Catch2</b> via <u>find_package()</u>
       first   before   trying   to   download   and   build   them   from   source,   they   could   set    the
       <u>FETCHCONTENT_TRY_FIND_PACKAGE_MODE</u>  variable  to  <b>ALWAYS</b>.   This  would  also  affect  any other calls to
       <u>FetchContent_Declare()</u> throughout the project, which might  not  be  acceptable.   The  behavior  can  be
       enabled  for  just these two dependencies instead by adding <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b> to the declared details and
       leaving <u>FETCHCONTENT_TRY_FIND_PACKAGE_MODE</u> unset, or set to <b>OPT_IN</b>:

          include(FetchContent)
          FetchContent_Declare(
            googletest
            GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
            GIT_TAG        703bd9caab50b139428cea1aaff9974ebee5742e # release-1.10.0
            FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS NAMES GTest
          )
          FetchContent_Declare(
            Catch2
            GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git
            GIT_TAG        605a34765aa5d5ecbf476b4598a862ada971b0cc # v3.0.1
            FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS
          )

          # This will try calling find_package() first for both dependencies
          FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest Catch2)

       For <b>Catch2</b>, no additional arguments to <u>find_package()</u> are needed, so no additional arguments are provided
       after the <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b> keyword.  For <b>googletest</b>, its package  is  more  commonly  called  <b>GTest</b>,  so
       arguments are added to support it being found by that name.

       If  the  user  wanted  to  disable  <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u>  from  calling  <u>find_package()</u>  for  any
       dependency,  even  if  it  provided  <b>FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS</b>  in  its  declared   details,   they   could   set
       <u>FETCHCONTENT_TRY_FIND_PACKAGE_MODE</u> to <b>NEVER</b>.

       If  the project wanted to indicate that these two dependencies should be downloaded and built from source
       and  that  <u>find_package()</u>  calls  should   be   redirected   to   use   the   built   dependencies,   the
       <b>OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE</b> option should be used when declaring the content details:

          include(FetchContent)
          FetchContent_Declare(
            googletest
            GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
            GIT_TAG        703bd9caab50b139428cea1aaff9974ebee5742e # release-1.10.0
            OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE
          )
          FetchContent_Declare(
            Catch2
            GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git
            GIT_TAG        605a34765aa5d5ecbf476b4598a862ada971b0cc # v3.0.1
            OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE
          )

          # The following will automatically forward through to FetchContent_MakeAvailable()
          find_package(googletest)
          find_package(Catch2)

       CMake  provides  a  FindGTest  module which defines some variables that older projects may use instead of
       linking to the imported targets.  To support those cases, we can provide an extra file.  In keeping  with
       the  "first  to  define,  wins" philosophy of <b>FetchContent</b>, we only write out that file if something else
       hasn't already done so.

          FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

          if(NOT EXISTS ${CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR}/googletest-extra.cmake AND
             NOT EXISTS ${CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR}/googletestExtra.cmake)
            file(WRITE ${CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR}/googletest-extra.cmake
          [=[
          if("${GTEST_LIBRARIES}" STREQUAL "" AND TARGET GTest::gtest)
            set(GTEST_LIBRARIES GTest::gtest)
          endif()
          if("${GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARIES}" STREQUAL "" AND TARGET GTest::gtest_main)
            set(GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARIES GTest::gtest_main)
          endif()
          if("${GTEST_BOTH_LIBRARIES}" STREQUAL "")
            set(GTEST_BOTH_LIBRARIES ${GTEST_LIBRARIES} ${GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARIES})
          endif()
          ]=])
          endif()

       Projects will also likely be using <b>find_package(GTest)</b> rather than <b>find_package(googletest)</b>,  but  it  is
       possible  to  make use of the <u>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR</u> area to pull in the latter as a dependency
       of the former.  This is likely to be sufficient to satisfy a typical <b>find_package(GTest)</b> call.

          FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

          if(NOT EXISTS ${CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR}/gtest-config.cmake AND
             NOT EXISTS ${CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR}/GTestConfig.cmake)
            file(WRITE ${CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR}/gtest-config.cmake
          [=[
          include(CMakeFindDependencyMacro)
          find_dependency(googletest)
          ]=])
          endif()

          if(NOT EXISTS ${CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR}/gtest-config-version.cmake AND
             NOT EXISTS ${CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR}/GTestConfigVersion.cmake)
            file(WRITE ${CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR}/gtest-config-version.cmake
          [=[
          include(${CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR}/googletest-config-version.cmake OPTIONAL)
          if(NOT PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE)
            include(${CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_REDIRECTS_DIR}/googletestConfigVersion.cmake OPTIONAL)
          endif()
          ]=])
          endif()

   <b>Overriding</b> <b>Where</b> <b>To</b> <b>Find</b> <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>
       If the sub-project's <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file is not at the top level of its source  tree,  the  <b>SOURCE_SUBDIR</b>
       option  can  be  used to tell <b>FetchContent</b> where to find it.  The following example shows how to use that
       option, and it also sets a variable which is meaningful to the subproject before pulling it into the main
       build (set as an <b>INTERNAL</b> cache variable to avoid problems with policy <u>CMP0077</u>):

          include(FetchContent)
          FetchContent_Declare(
            protobuf
            GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf.git

            SOURCE_SUBDIR  cmake
          )
          set(protobuf_BUILD_TESTS OFF CACHE INTERNAL "")
          FetchContent_MakeAvailable(protobuf)

   <b>Complex</b> <b>Dependency</b> <b>Hierarchies</b>
       In more complex project hierarchies, the dependency relationships can be more  complicated.   Consider  a
       hierarchy where <b>projA</b> is the top level project and it depends directly on projects <b>projB</b> and <b>projC</b>.  Both
       <b>projB</b>  and  <b>projC</b>  can  be  built  standalone  and they also both depend on another project <b>projD</b>.  <b>projB</b>
       additionally depends on <b>projE</b>.  This example assumes that all five projects are available  on  a  company
       git server.  The <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> of each project might have sections like the following:

       <u>projA</u>

          )

          FetchContent_MakeAvailable(projD)

       A few key points should be noted in the above:

       • <b>projB</b>  and  <b>projC</b>  define  different content details for <b>projD</b>, but <b>projA</b> also defines a set of content
         details for <b>projD</b>.  Because <b>projA</b> will define them first, the details from <b>projB</b> and <b>projC</b> will not  be
         used.   The  override  details defined by <b>projA</b> are not required to match either of those from <b>projB</b> or
         <b>projC</b>, but it is up to the higher level project to ensure that the details it does  define  still  make
         sense for the child projects.

       • In the <b>projA</b> call to <u>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</u>, <b>projD</b> is listed ahead of <b>projB</b> and <b>projC</b>, so it will
         be  populated  before  either  <b>projB</b> or <b>projC</b>. It isn't required for <b>projA</b> to do this, doing so ensures
         that <b>projA</b> fully controls the  environment  in  which  <b>projD</b>  is  brought  into  the  build  (directory
         properties are particularly relevant).

       • While   <b>projA</b>   defines   content   details   for   <b>projE</b>,   it   does  not  need  to  explicitly  call
         <b>FetchContent_MakeAvailable(projE)</b> or <b>FetchContent_Populate(projD)</b> itself.  Instead, it leaves  that  to
         the  child  <b>projB</b>.   For  higher level projects, it is often enough to just define the override content
         details and leave the actual population to the child projects.  This saves repeating the same thing  at
         each  level  of the project hierarchy unnecessarily, but it should only be done if directory properties
         set by dependencies are not expected to influence the population of the  shared  dependency  (<b>projE</b>  in
         this case).

   <b>Populating</b> <b>Content</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Adding</b> <b>It</b> <b>To</b> <b>The</b> <b>Build</b>
       Projects  don't  always need to add the populated content to the build.  Sometimes the project just wants
       to make the downloaded content available at a predictable location.  The next example ensures that a  set
       of standard company toolchain files (and potentially even the toolchain binaries themselves) is available
       early enough to be used for that same build.

          cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)

          include(FetchContent)
          FetchContent_Declare(
            mycom_toolchains
            URL  https://intranet.mycompany.com//toolchains_1.3.2.tar.gz
          )
          <a href="../manmycom_toolchains/FetchContent_MakeAvailable.mycom_toolchains.html">FetchContent_MakeAvailable</a>(mycom_toolchains)

          project(CrossCompileExample)

       The project could be configured to use one of the downloaded toolchains like so:

          cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=_deps/mycom_toolchains-src/toolchain_arm.cmake /path/to/src

       When   CMake   processes  the  <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>  file,  it  will  download  and  unpack  the  tarball  into
       <b>_deps/mycompany_toolchains-src</b> relative to the build directory.  The <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u> variable is not
       used until the <u>project()</u> command is reached, at which point CMake looks  for  the  named  toolchain  file
       relative  to  the build directory.  Because the tarball has already been downloaded and unpacked by then,
       the toolchain file will be in place, even the very first time that <b>cmake</b> is run in the build directory.

   <b>Populating</b> <b>Content</b> <b>In</b> <b>CMake</b> <b>Script</b> <b>Mode</b>
       This last example demonstrates how one might download and unpack a firmware tarball using CMake's  <u>script</u>
       <u>mode</u>.   The  call  to <u>FetchContent_Populate()</u> specifies all the content details and the unpacked firmware
       will be placed in a <b>firmware</b> directory below the current working directory.

   <b>FindPackageHandleStandardArgs</b>
       This   module   provides   functions   intended   to   be   used    in    <u>Find</u>    <u>Modules</u>    implementing
       <u>find_package(&lt;PackageName&gt;)</u> calls.

       <b>find_package_handle_standard_args</b>
              This command handles the <b>REQUIRED</b>, <b>QUIET</b> and version-related arguments of <u>find_package()</u>.  It also
              sets  the  <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FOUND</b>  variable.  The package is considered found if all variables listed
              contain valid results, e.g. valid filepaths.

              There are two signatures:

                 find_package_handle_standard_args(&lt;PackageName&gt;
                   (DEFAULT_MSG|&lt;custom-failure-message&gt;)
                   &lt;required-var&gt;...
                   )

                 find_package_handle_standard_args(&lt;PackageName&gt;
                   [FOUND_VAR &lt;result-var&gt;]
                   [REQUIRED_VARS &lt;required-var&gt;...]
                   [VERSION_VAR &lt;version-var&gt;]
                   [HANDLE_VERSION_RANGE]
                   [HANDLE_COMPONENTS]
                   [CONFIG_MODE]
                   [NAME_MISMATCHED]
                   [REASON_FAILURE_MESSAGE &lt;reason-failure-message&gt;]
                   [FAIL_MESSAGE &lt;custom-failure-message&gt;]
                   )

              The <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FOUND</b> variable will be set to <b>TRUE</b> if all the  variables  <b>&lt;required-var&gt;...</b>  are
              valid  and  any  optional  constraints  are  satisfied, and <b>FALSE</b> otherwise.  A success or failure
              message may be displayed based on the results and on whether the <b>REQUIRED</b> and/or <b>QUIET</b> option  was
              given to the <u>find_package()</u> call.

              The options are:

              <b>(DEFAULT_MSG|&lt;custom-failure-message&gt;)</b>
                     In  the  simple signature this specifies the failure message.  Use <b>DEFAULT_MSG</b> to ask for a
                     default message to be computed (recommended).  Not valid in the full signature.

              <b>FOUND_VAR</b> <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b>
                     Deprecated since version 3.3.

                     Specifies either <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FOUND</b> or <b>&lt;PACKAGENAME&gt;_FOUND</b> as the result  variable.   This
                     exists  only  for  compatibility  with  older versions of CMake and is now ignored.  Result
                     variables of both names are always set for compatibility.

              <b>REQUIRED_VARS</b> <b>&lt;required-var&gt;...</b>
                     Specify the variables which are required for this package.   These  may  be  named  in  the
                     generated  failure  message  asking the user to set the missing variable values.  Therefore
                     these should typically be cache entries such as <b>FOO_LIBRARY</b> and not output  variables  like
                     <b>FOO_LIBRARIES</b>.

                     Changed in version 3.18: If <b>HANDLE_COMPONENTS</b> is specified, this option can be omitted.

              <b>VERSION_VAR</b> <b>&lt;version-var&gt;</b>
                     Specify  the  name of a variable that holds the version of the package that has been found.
                     This version will be checked against the (potentially) specified required version given  to
                     the  <u>find_package()</u>  call,  including  its  <b>EXACT</b>  option.   The  default  messages include
                     information about the required version and the version which has been actually found,  both
                     if the version is ok or not.

              <b>HANDLE_VERSION_RANGE</b>
                     Added in version 3.19.

                     Enable  handling  of a version range, if one is specified. Without this option, a developer
                     warning will be displayed if a version range is specified.

              <b>HANDLE_COMPONENTS</b>
                     Enable handling of package components.   In  this  case,  the  command  will  report  which
                     components have been found and which are missing, and the <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FOUND</b> variable will
                     be  set  to  <b>FALSE</b>  if  any  of the required components (i.e. not the ones listed after the
                     <b>OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS</b> option of <u>find_package()</u>) are missing.

              <b>CONFIG_MODE</b>
                     Specify   that   the   calling   find   module   is   a   wrapper   around   a   call    to
                     <b>find_package(&lt;PackageName&gt;</b>    <b>NO_MODULE)</b>.     This   implies   a   <b>VERSION_VAR</b>   value   of
                     <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_VERSION</b>.   The  command  will  automatically  check   whether   the   package
                     configuration file was found.

              <b>REASON_FAILURE_MESSAGE</b> <b>&lt;reason-failure-message&gt;</b>
                     Added in version 3.16.

                     Specify  a  custom  message  of  the  reason  for the failure which will be appended to the
                     default generated message.

              <b>FAIL_MESSAGE</b> <b>&lt;custom-failure-message&gt;</b>
                     Specify a custom failure message instead of  using  the  default  generated  message.   Not
                     recommended.

              <b>NAME_MISMATCHED</b>
                     Added in version 3.17.

                     Indicate  that the <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> does not match <b>${CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME}</b>. This is usually
                     a mistake and raises a warning, but it may be intentional for  usage  of  the  command  for
                     components of a larger package.

       Example for the simple signature:

          find_package_handle_standard_args(LibXml2 DEFAULT_MSG
            LIBXML2_LIBRARY LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR)

       The  <b>LibXml2</b> package is considered to be found if both <b>LIBXML2_LIBRARY</b> and <b>LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR</b> are valid.
       Then also <b>LibXml2_FOUND</b> is set to <b>TRUE</b>.  If it is not found and  <b>REQUIRED</b>  was  used,  it  fails  with  a
       <u>message(FATAL_ERROR)</u>,  independent  whether  <b>QUIET</b>  was  used  or  not.   If it is found, success will be
       reported, including the content of the first <b>&lt;required-var&gt;</b>.  On repeated CMake runs,  the  same  message
       will not be printed again.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          If  <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;</b>  does not match <b>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME</b> for the calling module, a warning that there
          is a mismatch is given. The <b>FPHSA_NAME_MISMATCHED</b> variable may be set to bypass the warning  if  using
          the  old  signature  and  the  <b>NAME_MISMATCHED</b>  argument using the new signature. To avoid forcing the
          caller to require newer versions of CMake for usage, the variable's value will be used if defined when
          the <b>NAME_MISMATCHED</b> argument is not passed for the new signature (but using both is an error)..

       Example for the full signature:

          find_package_handle_standard_args(LibArchive
            REQUIRED_VARS LibArchive_LIBRARY LibArchive_INCLUDE_DIR
            VERSION_VAR LibArchive_VERSION)

       In this case,  the  <b>LibArchive</b>  package  is  considered  to  be  found  if  both  <b>LibArchive_LIBRARY</b>  and
       <b>LibArchive_INCLUDE_DIR</b>  are  valid.   Also the version of <b>LibArchive</b> will be checked by using the version
       contained in <b>LibArchive_VERSION</b>.  Since no <b>FAIL_MESSAGE</b> is given, the default messages will be printed.

       Another example for the full signature:

          find_package(Automoc4 QUIET NO_MODULE HINTS /opt/automoc4)
          find_package_handle_standard_args(Automoc4  CONFIG_MODE)

       In this case, a <b>FindAutmoc4.cmake</b> module wraps a call to <b>find_package(Automoc4</b>  <b>NO_MODULE)</b>  and  adds  an
       additional  search directory for <b>automoc4</b>.  Then the call to <b>find_package_handle_standard_args</b> produces a
       proper success/failure message.

       <b>find_package_check_version</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              Helper function which can be used to  check  if  a  <b>&lt;version&gt;</b>  is  valid  against  version-related
              arguments of <u>find_package()</u>.

                 find_package_check_version(&lt;version&gt; &lt;result-var&gt;
                   [HANDLE_VERSION_RANGE]
                   [RESULT_MESSAGE_VARIABLE &lt;message-var&gt;]
                   )

              The <b>&lt;result-var&gt;</b> will hold a boolean value giving the result of the check.

              The options are:

              <b>HANDLE_VERSION_RANGE</b>
                     Enable  handling  of a version range, if one is specified. Without this option, a developer
                     warning will be displayed if a version range is specified.

              <b>RESULT_MESSAGE_VARIABLE</b> <b>&lt;message-var&gt;</b>
                     Specify a variable to get back a message describing the result of the check.

       Example for the usage:

          find_package_check_version(1.2.3 result HANDLE_VERSION_RANGE
            RESULT_MESSAGE_VARIABLE reason)
          if (result)
            message (STATUS "${reason}")
          else()
            message (FATAL_ERROR "${reason}")
          endif()

   <b>FindPackageMessage</b>
          find_package_message(&lt;name&gt; "message for user" "find result details")

       This function is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules files.  It will print a  message  once  for
       each  unique  find  result.   This  is  useful for telling the user where a package was found.  The first
       argument specifies the name (XXX) of the package.  The second argument specifies the message to  display.
       The  third  argument  lists  details  about  the  find  result so that if they change the message will be
       displayed again.  The macro also obeys the QUIET argument to the find_package command.

       Example:

          if(X11_FOUND)
            find_package_message(X11 "Found X11: ${X11_X11_LIB}"
              "[${X11_X11_LIB}][${X11_INCLUDE_DIR}]")
          else()
           ...
          endif()

   <b>FortranCInterface</b>
       Fortran/C Interface Detection

       This module automatically detects the API by which C and Fortran languages interact.

   <b>Module</b> <b>Variables</b>
       Variables that indicate if the mangling is found:

       <b>FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_FOUND</b>
              Global subroutines and functions.

       <b>FortranCInterface_MODULE_FOUND</b>
              Module subroutines and functions (declared by "MODULE PROCEDURE").

       This module also provides the following variables to specify the detected mangling, though a typical  use
       case does not need to reference them and can use the <u>Module</u> <u>Functions</u> below.

       <b>FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_PREFIX</b>
              Prefix for a global symbol without an underscore.

       <b>FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SUFFIX</b>
              Suffix for a global symbol without an underscore.

       <b>FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_CASE</b>
              The case for a global symbol without an underscore, either <b>UPPER</b> or <b>LOWER</b>.

       <b>FortranCInterface_GLOBAL__PREFIX</b>
              Prefix for a global symbol with an underscore.

       <b>FortranCInterface_GLOBAL__SUFFIX</b>
              Suffix for a global symbol with an underscore.

       <b>FortranCInterface_GLOBAL__CASE</b>
              The case for a global symbol with an underscore, either <b>UPPER</b> or <b>LOWER</b>.

       <b>FortranCInterface_MODULE_PREFIX</b>
              Prefix for a module symbol without an underscore.

       <b>FortranCInterface_MODULE_MIDDLE</b>
              Middle  of  a  module symbol without an underscore that appears between the name of the module and
              the name of the symbol.

       <b>FortranCInterface_MODULE_SUFFIX</b>
              Suffix for a module symbol without an underscore.

       <b>FortranCInterface_MODULE_CASE</b>
              The case for a module symbol without an underscore, either <b>UPPER</b> or <b>LOWER</b>.

       <b>FortranCInterface_MODULE__PREFIX</b>
              Prefix for a module symbol with an underscore.

       <b>FortranCInterface_MODULE__MIDDLE</b>
              Middle of a module symbol with an underscore that appears between the name of the module  and  the
              name of the symbol.

       <b>FortranCInterface_MODULE__SUFFIX</b>
              Suffix for a module symbol with an underscore.

       <b>FortranCInterface_MODULE__CASE</b>
              The case for a module symbol with an underscore, either <b>UPPER</b> or <b>LOWER</b>.

   <b>Module</b> <b>Functions</b>
       <b>FortranCInterface_HEADER</b>
              The <b>FortranCInterface_HEADER</b> function is provided to generate a C header file containing macros to
              mangle symbol names:

                 FortranCInterface_HEADER(&lt;file&gt;
                                          [MACRO_NAMESPACE &lt;macro-ns&gt;]
                                          [SYMBOL_NAMESPACE &lt;ns&gt;]
                                          [SYMBOLS [&lt;module&gt;:]&lt;function&gt; ...])

              It generates in <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> definitions of the following macros:

                 #define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL (name,NAME) ...
                 #define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_(name,NAME) ...
                 #define FortranCInterface_MODULE (mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...
                 #define FortranCInterface_MODULE_(mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...

              These macros mangle four categories of Fortran symbols, respectively:

              • Global symbols without '_': <b>call</b> <b>mysub()</b>

              • Global symbols with '_'   : <b>call</b> <b>my_sub()</b>

              • Module symbols without '_': <b>use</b> <b>mymod;</b> <b>call</b> <b>mysub()</b>

              • Module symbols with '_'   : <b>use</b> <b>mymod;</b> <b>call</b> <b>my_sub()</b>

              If  mangling  for  a  category  is not known, its macro is left undefined.  All macros require raw
              names in both lower case and upper case.

              The options are:

              <b>MACRO_NAMESPACE</b>
                     Replace the default <b>FortranCInterface_</b> prefix with a given namespace <b>&lt;macro-ns&gt;</b>.

              <b>SYMBOLS</b>
                     List symbols to mangle automatically with C preprocessor definitions:

                        &lt;function&gt;          ==&gt; #define &lt;ns&gt;&lt;function&gt; ...
                        &lt;module&gt;:&lt;function&gt; ==&gt; #define &lt;ns&gt;&lt;module&gt;_&lt;function&gt; ...

                     If the mangling for some symbol is not known then no preprocessor  definition  is  created,
                     and a warning is displayed.

              <b>SYMBOL_NAMESPACE</b>
                     Prefix  all preprocessor definitions generated by the <b>SYMBOLS</b> option with a given namespace
                     <b>&lt;ns&gt;</b>.

       <b>FortranCInterface_VERIFY</b>
              The <b>FortranCInterface_VERIFY</b> function is provided to verify that the Fortran and  C/C++  compilers
              work together:

                 FortranCInterface_VERIFY([CXX] [QUIET])

              It  tests  whether  a  simple  test executable using Fortran and C (and C++ when the CXX option is
              given)  compiles  and  links  successfully.   The  result   is   stored   in   the   cache   entry
              <b>FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_C</b> (or <b>FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_CXX</b> if <b>CXX</b> is given) as a boolean.  If
              the  check  fails  and  <b>QUIET</b>  is  not  given  the  function terminates with a fatal error message
              describing the problem.  The purpose of this check is to  stop  a  build  early  for  incompatible
              compiler combinations.  The test is built in the <b>Release</b> configuration.

   <b>Example</b> <b>Usage</b>
          include(FortranCInterface)
          FortranCInterface_HEADER(FC.h MACRO_NAMESPACE "FC_")

       This  creates  a  "FC.h"  header that defines mangling macros <b>FC_GLOBAL()</b>, <b>FC_GLOBAL_()</b>, <b>FC_MODULE()</b>, and
       <b>FC_MODULE_()</b>.

          include(FortranCInterface)
          FortranCInterface_HEADER(FCMangle.h
                                   MACRO_NAMESPACE "FC_"
                                   SYMBOL_NAMESPACE "FC_"
                                   SYMBOLS mysub mymod:my_sub)

       This creates a "FCMangle.h" header that defines the same <b>FC_*()</b> mangling macros as the  previous  example
       plus preprocessor symbols <b>FC_mysub</b> and <b>FC_mymod_my_sub</b>.

   <b>Additional</b> <b>Manglings</b>
       FortranCInterface  is  aware  of  possible <b>GLOBAL</b> and <b>MODULE</b> manglings for many Fortran compilers, but it
       also provides an interface to specify new possible manglings.  Set the variables:

          FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS
          FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS

       before including FortranCInterface to specify manglings of the symbols <b>MySub</b>, <b>My_Sub</b>, <b>MyModule:MySub</b>, and
       <b>My_Module:My_Sub</b>.  For example, the code:

          set(FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS mysub_ my_sub__ MYSUB_)
            #                                  ^^^^^  ^^^^^^   ^^^^^
          set(FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS
              __mymodule_MOD_mysub __my_module_MOD_my_sub)
            #   ^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^
          include(FortranCInterface)

       tells FortranCInterface to try given <b>GLOBAL</b> and <b>MODULE</b> manglings.  (The carets point at raw symbol  names
       for clarity in this example but are not needed.)

   <b>GenerateExportHeader</b>
       Function for generation of export macros for libraries

       This module provides the function <b>GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER()</b>.

       Added in version 3.12: Added support for C projects.  Previous versions supported C++ project only.

       The  <b>GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER</b>  function  can be used to generate a file suitable for preprocessor inclusion
       which contains EXPORT macros to be used in library classes:

          GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER( LIBRARY_TARGET

       The target properties  <u>CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET</u>  and  <u>VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN</u>  can  be  used  to  add  the
       appropriate  compile  flags  for  targets.   See  the  documentation  of those target properties, and the
       convenience variables <u>CMAKE_CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET</u> and <u>CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN</u>.

       By default <b>GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER()</b> generates macro names in a file name determined by the  name  of  the
       library.  This means that in the simplest case, users of <b>GenerateExportHeader</b> will be equivalent to:

          set(CMAKE_CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET hidden)
          set(CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN 1)
          add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
          generate_export_header(somelib)
          install(TARGETS somelib DESTINATION ${LIBRARY_INSTALL_DIR})
          install(FILES
           someclass.h
           ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/somelib_export.h DESTINATION ${INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR}
          )

       And in the ABI header files:

          #include "somelib_export.h"
          class SOMELIB_EXPORT SomeClass {
            ...
          };

       The  CMake  fragment  will  generate  a  file  in the <b>${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}</b> called <b>somelib_export.h</b>
       containing the macros <b>SOMELIB_EXPORT</b>,  <b>SOMELIB_NO_EXPORT</b>,  <b>SOMELIB_DEPRECATED</b>,  <b>SOMELIB_DEPRECATED_EXPORT</b>
       and  <b>SOMELIB_DEPRECATED_NO_EXPORT</b>.  They will be followed by content taken from the variable specified by
       the <b>CUSTOM_CONTENT_FROM_VARIABLE</b> option, if any.  The resulting  file  should  be  installed  with  other
       headers in the library.

       The <b>BASE_NAME</b> argument can be used to override the file name and the names used for the macros:

          add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
          generate_export_header(somelib
            BASE_NAME other_name
          )

       Generates a file called <b>other_name_export.h</b> containing the macros <b>OTHER_NAME_EXPORT</b>, <b>OTHER_NAME_NO_EXPORT</b>
       and <b>OTHER_NAME_DEPRECATED</b> etc.

       The <b>BASE_NAME</b> may be overridden by specifying other options in the function.  For example:

          add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
          generate_export_header(somelib
            EXPORT_MACRO_NAME OTHER_NAME_EXPORT
          )

       creates  the  macro  <b>OTHER_NAME_EXPORT</b> instead of <b>SOMELIB_EXPORT</b>, but other macros and the generated file
       name is as default:

          add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
          generate_export_header(somelib
            DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME KDE_DEPRECATED
          )

       creates the macro <b>KDE_DEPRECATED</b> instead of <b>SOMELIB_DEPRECATED</b>.

       If <b>LIBRARY_TARGET</b> is a static library, macros are defined without values.

       If the same sources are used to create both  a  shared  and  a  static  library,  the  uppercased  symbol
       <b>${BASE_NAME}_STATIC_DEFINE</b> should be used when building the static library:

          add_library(shared_variant SHARED ${lib_SRCS})
          add_library(static_variant ${lib_SRCS})
          generate_export_header(shared_variant BASE_NAME libshared_and_static)
          set_target_properties(static_variant PROPERTIES
            COMPILE_FLAGS -DLIBSHARED_AND_STATIC_STATIC_DEFINE)

       This will cause the export macros to expand to nothing when building the static library.

       If  <b>DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED</b> is specified, then a macro <b>${BASE_NAME}_NO_DEPRECATED</b> will be defined This macro
       can be used to remove deprecated code from preprocessor output:

          option(EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED "Exclude deprecated parts of the library" FALSE)
          if (EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED)
            set(NO_BUILD_DEPRECATED DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED)
          endif()
          generate_export_header(somelib ${NO_BUILD_DEPRECATED})

       And then in somelib:

          class SOMELIB_EXPORT SomeClass
          {
          public:
          #ifndef SOMELIB_NO_DEPRECATED
            SOMELIB_DEPRECATED void oldMethod();
          #endif
          };

          #ifndef SOMELIB_NO_DEPRECATED
          void SomeClass::oldMethod() {  }
          #endif

       If <b>PREFIX_NAME</b> is specified, the argument will be used as a prefix to all generated macros.

       For example:

          generate_export_header(somelib PREFIX_NAME VTK_)

       Generates the macros <b>VTK_SOMELIB_EXPORT</b> etc.

       Added in version 3.1: Library target can be an <b>OBJECT</b> library.

       Added in version 3.7: Added the <b>CUSTOM_CONTENT_FROM_VARIABLE</b> option.

       Added in version 3.11: Added the <b>INCLUDE_GUARD_NAME</b> option.

          ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS( [&lt;output_variable&gt;] )

       Deprecated   since   version   3.0:    Set    the    target    properties    <u>CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET</u>    and
       <u>VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN</u> instead.

       The <b>ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS</b> function adds <b>-fvisibility=hidden</b> to <u>CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS</u> if supported, and is a
       no-op on Windows which does not need extra compiler flags for exporting support.  You may optionally pass
       a  single  argument  to  <b>ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS</b>  that will be populated with the <b>CXX_FLAGS</b> required to
       enable visibility support for the compiler/architecture in use.

   <b>GNUInstallDirs</b>
       Define GNU standard installation directories

       Provides install directory variables as defined by the <u>GNU</u> <u>Coding</u> <u>Standards</u>.

   <b>Result</b> <b>Variables</b>
       Inclusion of this module defines the following variables:

       <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_&lt;dir&gt;</b>
          Destination for files of a given type.  This value  may  be  passed  to  the  <b>DESTINATION</b>  options  of
          <u>install()</u>  commands for the corresponding file type.  It should be a path relative to the installation
          prefix so that it can be converted to an absolute path in a relocatable way.

          While absolute paths are allowed, they are not  recommended  as  they  do  not  work  with  the  <b>cmake</b>
          <b>--install</b>  command's  <u>--prefix</u> option, or with the <u>cpack</u> installer generators. In particular, there is
          no need to make paths absolute by prepending <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>; this prefix is used by  default  if
          the DESTINATION is a relative path.

       <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_&lt;dir&gt;</b>
          The  absolute  path  generated  from the corresponding <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_&lt;dir&gt;</b> value.  If the value is not
          already an absolute path, an absolute path is constructed typically by prepending  the  value  of  the
          <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> variable.  However, there are some <u>special</u> <u>cases</u> as documented below.

          These  variables  shouldn't be used in <u>install()</u> commands as they do not work with the <b>cmake</b> <b>--install</b>
          command's <u>--prefix</u> option, or with the <u>cpack</u> installer generators.

   <b>Special</b> <b>Cases</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       The following values of <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> are special:

       <b>/</b>
          For <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> other than the <b>SYSCONFDIR</b>, <b>LOCALSTATEDIR</b> and <b>RUNSTATEDIR</b>, the value  of  <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_&lt;dir&gt;</b>
          is  prefixed  with  <b>usr/</b> if it is not user-specified as an absolute path.  For example, the <b>INCLUDEDIR</b>
          value <b>include</b> becomes <b>usr/include</b>.  This is required by the <u>GNU</u> <u>Coding</u> <u>Standards</u>, which state:
              When building the complete GNU system, the prefix will be empty and <b><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b> will be a  symbolic  link
              to <b>/</b>.

       <b><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b>
          For  <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> equal to <b>SYSCONFDIR</b>, <b>LOCALSTATEDIR</b> or <b>RUNSTATEDIR</b>, the <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_&lt;dir&gt;</b> is computed
          by prepending just <b>/</b> to the value of <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_&lt;dir&gt;</b> if it is not user-specified  as  an  absolute
          path.   For  example,  the  <b>SYSCONFDIR</b>  value  <b>etc</b>  becomes  <b><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></b>.  This is required by the <u>GNU</u> <u>Coding</u>
          <u>Standards</u>.

       <b>/opt/...</b>
          For <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> equal to <b>SYSCONFDIR</b>, <b>LOCALSTATEDIR</b> or <b>RUNSTATEDIR</b>, the <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_&lt;dir&gt;</b> is  computed
          by <u>appending</u> the prefix to the value of <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_&lt;dir&gt;</b> if it is not user-specified as an absolute
          path.   For example, the <b>SYSCONFDIR</b> value <b>etc</b> becomes <b>/etc/opt/...</b>.  This is defined by the <u>Filesystem</u>
          <u>Hierarchy</u> <u>Standard</u>.

          This behavior does not apply to paths under <b>/opt/homebrew/...</b>.

   <b>Macros</b>
       <b>GNUInstallDirs_get_absolute_install_dir</b>

                 GNUInstallDirs_get_absolute_install_dir(absvar var dirname)

              Added in version 3.7.

              Set the given variable <b>absvar</b> to the absolute path contained within the variable <b>var</b>.  This is  to
              allow  the computation of an absolute path, accounting for all the special cases documented above.
              While this macro is used to compute the various <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_&lt;dir&gt;</b> variables, it is  exposed
              publicly  to allow users who create additional path variables to also compute absolute paths where
              necessary, using the same logic.  <b>dirname</b> is the directory name to get, e.g. <b>BINDIR</b>.

              Changed in version 3.20: Added the <b>&lt;dirname&gt;</b> parameter.  Previous versions of  CMake  passed  this
              value through the variable <b>${dir}</b>.

   <b>GoogleTest</b>
       Added in version 3.9.

       This  module  defines  functions  to  help use the Google Test infrastructure.  Two mechanisms for adding
       tests are provided. <u>gtest_add_tests()</u> has been around for some time, originally via  <b>find_package(GTest)</b>.
       <u>gtest_discover_tests()</u> was introduced in CMake 3.10.

       The (older) <u>gtest_add_tests()</u> scans source files to identify tests.  This is usually effective, with some
       caveats, including in cross-compiling environments, and makes setting additional properties on tests more
       convenient.   However,  its  handling  of  parameterized  tests  is  less  comprehensive, and it requires
       re-running CMake to detect changes to the list of tests.

       The (newer) <u>gtest_discover_tests()</u> discovers tests by asking the compiled test  executable  to  enumerate
       its tests.  This is more robust and provides better handling of parameterized tests, and does not require
       CMake  to  be  re-run  when tests change.  However, it may not work in a cross-compiling environment, and
       setting test properties is less convenient.

       More details can be found in the documentation of the respective functions.

       Both commands are intended to replace use of <u>add_test()</u> to register tests, and  will  create  a  separate
       CTest  test  for  each  Google Test test case.  Note that this is in some cases less efficient, as common
       set-up and tear-down logic cannot be shared by multiple  test  cases  executing  in  the  same  instance.
       However,  it  provides  more  fine-grained pass/fail information to CTest, which is usually considered as
       more beneficial.  By  default,  the  CTest  test  name  is  the  same  as  the  Google  Test  name  (i.e.
       <b>suite.testcase</b>); see also <b>TEST_PREFIX</b> and <b>TEST_SUFFIX</b>.

       <b>gtest_add_tests</b>
              Automatically add tests with CTest by scanning source code for Google Test macros:

                 gtest_add_tests(TARGET target
                                 [SOURCES src1...]
                                 [EXTRA_ARGS args...]
                                 [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                                 [TEST_PREFIX prefix]
                                 [TEST_SUFFIX suffix]
                                 [SKIP_DEPENDENCY]
                                 [TEST_LIST outVar]
                 )

              <b>gtest_add_tests</b>  attempts  to identify tests by scanning source files.  Although this is generally
              effective, it uses only a basic regular expression match, which can be defeated by  atypical  test
              declarations,  and is unable to fully "split" parameterized tests.  Additionally, it requires that
              CMake be re-run to discover any newly added, removed or renamed tests (by default, this means that
              CMake is re-run when any test source file is changed, but see <b>SKIP_DEPENDENCY</b>).  However,  it  has
              the  advantage  of  declaring  tests  at  CMake time, which somewhat simplifies setting additional
              properties on tests, and always works in a cross-compiling environment.

              The options are:

              <b>TARGET</b> <b>target</b>
                     Specifies the Google Test executable, which must be a known CMake executable target.  CMake
                     will substitute the location of the built executable when running the test.

              <b>SOURCES</b> <b>src1...</b>
                     When provided, only the listed files will be scanned for test cases.  If this option is not
                     given, the <u>SOURCES</u> property of the specified <b>target</b> will be used  to  obtain  the  list  of
                     sources.

              <b>EXTRA_ARGS</b> <b>args...</b>
                     Any extra arguments to pass on the command line to each test case.

                     Changed in version 3.31: Empty values in <b>args...</b> are preserved, see <u>CMP0178</u>.

              <b>WORKING_DIRECTORY</b> <b>dir</b>
                     Specifies  the  directory in which to run the discovered test cases.  If this option is not
                     provided, the current binary directory is used.

              <b>TEST_PREFIX</b> <b>prefix</b>
                     Specifies a <b>prefix</b> to be prepended to the name of each discovered test case.  This  can  be
                     useful  when the same source files are being used in multiple calls to <b>gtest_add_test()</b> but
                     with different <b>EXTRA_ARGS</b>.

              <b>TEST_SUFFIX</b> <b>suffix</b>
                     Similar to <b>TEST_PREFIX</b> except the <b>suffix</b> is appended to the name of every  discovered  test
                     case.  Both <b>TEST_PREFIX</b> and <b>TEST_SUFFIX</b> may be specified.

              <b>SKIP_DEPENDENCY</b>
                     Normally,  the  function creates a dependency which will cause CMake to be re-run if any of
                     the sources being scanned are changed.  This is to ensure that the list of discovered tests
                     is updated.  If this behavior is not desired (as may be the case while actually writing the
                     test cases), this option can be used to prevent the dependency from being added.

              <b>TEST_LIST</b> <b>outVar</b>
                     The variable named by <b>outVar</b> will be populated in  the  calling  scope  with  the  list  of
                     discovered test cases.  This allows the caller to do things like manipulate test properties
                     of the discovered tests.

              Changed  in  version  3.31:  Empty  values in the <u>TEST_LAUNCHER</u> and <u>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u> target
              properties are preserved, see policy <u>CMP0178</u>.

              Usage example:

                 include(GoogleTest)
                 add_executable(FooTest FooUnitTest.cxx)
                 gtest_add_tests(TARGET      FooTest
                                 TEST_SUFFIX .noArgs
                                 TEST_LIST   noArgsTests
                 )
                 gtest_add_tests(TARGET      FooTest
                                 EXTRA_ARGS  --someArg someValue
                                 TEST_SUFFIX .withArgs
                                 TEST_LIST   withArgsTests
                 )
                 set_tests_properties(${noArgsTests}   PROPERTIES TIMEOUT 10)
                 set_tests_properties(${withArgsTests} PROPERTIES TIMEOUT 20)

              For backward compatibility, the following form is also supported:

                 gtest_add_tests(exe args files...)

              <b>exe</b>    The path to the test executable or the name of a CMake target.

              <b>args</b>   A ;-list of extra arguments to be passed to executable.  The entire list must be passed  as
                     a single argument.  Enclose it in quotes, or pass <b>""</b> for no arguments.

              <b>files...</b>
                     A  list  of source files to search for tests and test fixtures.  Alternatively, use <b>AUTO</b> to
                     specify that <b>exe</b> is the name of a CMake executable target whose sources should be scanned.

                 include(GoogleTest)

              Added in version 3.10.

              <b>gtest_discover_tests()</b> sets up a post-build or  pre-test  command  on  the  test  executable  that
              generates  the  list  of  tests  by  parsing  the output from running the test executable with the
              <b>--gtest_list_tests</b> argument.  Compared to the source parsing approach of  <u>gtest_add_tests()</u>,  this
              ensures that the full list of tests, including instantiations of parameterized tests, is obtained.
              Since  test  discovery  occurs at build or test time, it is not necessary to re-run CMake when the
              list of tests changes.  However, it requires that <u>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u> is properly set in order
              to function in a cross-compiling environment.

              Additionally, setting properties on tests is somewhat less convenient, since  the  tests  are  not
              available  at  CMake  time.   Additional  test properties may be assigned to the set of tests as a
              whole using the <b>PROPERTIES</b> option.  If more fine-grained test control is  needed,  custom  content
              may  be provided through an external CTest script using the <u>TEST_INCLUDE_FILES</u> directory property.
              The set of discovered tests is made accessible to such a script via  the  <b>&lt;target&gt;_TESTS</b>  variable
              (see the <b>TEST_LIST</b> option below for further discussion and limitations).

              The options are:

              <b>target</b> Specifies the Google Test executable, which must be a known CMake executable target.  CMake
                     will substitute the location of the built executable when running the test.

              <b>EXTRA_ARGS</b> <b>args...</b>
                     Any extra arguments to pass on the command line to each test case.

                     Changed in version 3.31: Empty values in <b>args...</b> are preserved, see <u>CMP0178</u>.

              <b>WORKING_DIRECTORY</b> <b>dir</b>
                     Specifies  the  directory in which to run the discovered test cases.  If this option is not
                     provided, the current binary directory is used.

              <b>TEST_PREFIX</b> <b>prefix</b>
                     Specifies a <b>prefix</b> to be prepended to the name of each discovered test case.  This  can  be
                     useful   when   the   same   test   executable   is   being   used  in  multiple  calls  to
                     <b>gtest_discover_tests()</b> but with different <b>EXTRA_ARGS</b>.

              <b>TEST_SUFFIX</b> <b>suffix</b>
                     Similar to <b>TEST_PREFIX</b> except the <b>suffix</b> is appended to the name of every  discovered  test
                     case.  Both <b>TEST_PREFIX</b> and <b>TEST_SUFFIX</b> may be specified.

              <b>TEST_FILTER</b> <b>expr</b>
                     Added in version 3.22.

                     Filter  expression  to  pass as a <b>--gtest_filter</b> argument during test discovery.  Note that
                     the expression is a wildcard-based format that matches against the original test  names  as
                     used  by gtest.  For type or value-parameterized tests, these names may be different to the
                     potentially pretty-printed test names that <b>ctest</b> uses.

              <b>NO_PRETTY_TYPES</b>
                     By default, the type index of type-parameterized tests is replaced by the actual type  name
                     in  the  CTest test name.  If this behavior is undesirable (e.g. because the type names are
                     unwieldy), this option will suppress this behavior.

              <b>NO_PRETTY_VALUES</b>
                     By default, the value index of value-parameterized tests is replaced by the actual value in
                     the CTest test name.  If this behavior is undesirable (e.g. because the value  strings  are
                     unwieldy), this option will suppress this behavior.

              <b>PROPERTIES</b> <b>name1</b> <b>value1...</b>
                     Specifies  additional  properties  to  be set on all tests discovered by this invocation of
                     <b>gtest_discover_tests()</b>.

              <b>TEST_LIST</b> <b>var</b>
                     Make  the  list  of  tests  available  in  the  variable  <b>var</b>,  rather  than  the   default
                     <b>&lt;target&gt;_TESTS</b>.  This can be useful when the same test executable is being used in multiple
                     calls to <b>gtest_discover_tests()</b>.  Note that this variable is only available in CTest.

                     Due  to  a  limitation of CMake's parsing rules, any test with a square bracket in its name
                     will be omitted from the list of tests stored in this variable.  Such tests will  still  be
                     defined and executed by <b>ctest</b> as normal though.

              <b>DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT</b> <b>num</b>
                     Added in version 3.10.3.

                     Specifies  how long (in seconds) CMake will wait for the test to enumerate available tests.
                     If the test takes longer than this, discovery  (and  your  build)  will  fail.   Most  test
                     executables   will   enumerate  their  tests  very  quickly,  but  under  some  exceptional
                     circumstances, a test may require a longer timeout.   The  default  is  5.   See  also  the
                     <b>TIMEOUT</b> option of <u>execute_process()</u>.

                     <b>NOTE:</b>
                        In  CMake versions 3.10.1 and 3.10.2, this option was called <b>TIMEOUT</b>.  This clashed with
                        the <b>TIMEOUT</b> test property, which is one of the common properties that would be set  with
                        the  <b>PROPERTIES</b>  keyword, usually leading to legal but unintended behavior.  The keyword
                        was changed to <b>DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT</b> in CMake 3.10.3 to address this problem.  The ambiguous
                        behavior of the <b>TIMEOUT</b> keyword in 3.10.1 and 3.10.2 has not been preserved.

              <b>XML_OUTPUT_DIR</b> <b>dir</b>
                     Added in version 3.18.

                     If specified, the parameter is passed along with <b>--gtest_output=xml:</b>  to  test  executable.
                     The  actual  file  name  is  the same as the test target, including prefix and suffix. This
                     should be used instead of <b>EXTRA_ARGS</b> <b>--gtest_output=xml</b> to avoid  race  conditions  writing
                     the XML result output when using parallel test execution.

              <b>DISCOVERY_MODE</b>
                     Added in version 3.18.

                     Provides  greater  control  over  when  <b>gtest_discover_tests()</b>  performs test discovery. By
                     default, <b>POST_BUILD</b> sets up a post-build command to perform test discovery at  build  time.
                     In  certain scenarios, like cross-compiling, this <b>POST_BUILD</b> behavior is not desirable.  By
                     contrast, <b>PRE_TEST</b> delays test discovery until just prior to test execution. This way  test
                     discovery  occurs  in  the target environment where the test has a better chance at finding
                     appropriate runtime dependencies.

                     <b>DISCOVERY_MODE</b> defaults  to  the  value  of  the  <b>CMAKE_GTEST_DISCOVER_TESTS_DISCOVERY_MODE</b>
                     variable if it is not passed when calling <b>gtest_discover_tests()</b>. This provides a mechanism
                     for  globally  selecting  a preferred test discovery behavior without having to modify each
                     call site.

              <b>DISCOVERY_EXTRA_ARGS</b> <b>args...</b>
                     Added in version 3.31.

                     Any extra arguments to pass on the command line for the discovery command.

              Added in version 3.29: The <u>TEST_LAUNCHER</u> target property is honored during test discovery and test
              execution.

              Changed in version 3.31: Empty values in  the  <u>TEST_LAUNCHER</u>  and  <u>CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR</u>  target
              properties are preserved, see policy <u>CMP0178</u>.

   <b>InstallRequiredSystemLibraries</b>
       Include  this  module  to search for compiler-provided system runtime libraries and add install rules for
       them.  Some optional variables may be set prior to including the module to adjust behavior:

       <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS</b>
              Specify additional runtime libraries that may not  be  detected.   After  inclusion  any  detected
              libraries will be appended to this.

       <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_SKIP</b>
              Set to TRUE to skip calling the <u>install(PROGRAMS)</u> command to allow the includer to specify its own
              install rule, using the value of <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS</b> to get the list of libraries.

       <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES</b>
              Set to TRUE to install the debug runtime libraries when available with MSVC tools.

       <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES_ONLY</b>
              Set  to  TRUE  to  install  only  the  debug runtime libraries with MSVC tools even if the release
              runtime libraries are also available.

       <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_UCRT_LIBRARIES</b>
              Added in version 3.6.

              Set to TRUE to install the Windows Universal CRT  libraries  for  app-local  deployment  (e.g.  to
              Windows XP).  This is meaningful only with MSVC from Visual Studio 2015 or higher.

              Added  in version 3.9: One may set a <b>CMAKE_WINDOWS_KITS_10_DIR</b> <u>environment</u> <u>variable</u> to an absolute
              path to tell CMake to look for Windows 10 SDKs in a custom location.  The specified  directory  is
              expected to contain <b>Redist/ucrt/DLLs/*</b> directories.

       <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_MFC_LIBRARIES</b>
              Set to TRUE to install the MSVC MFC runtime libraries.

       <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_OPENMP_LIBRARIES</b>
              Set to TRUE to install the MSVC OpenMP runtime libraries

       <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_DESTINATION</b>
              Specify the <u>install(PROGRAMS)</u> command <b>DESTINATION</b> option.  If not specified, the default is <b>bin</b> on
              Windows and <b>lib</b> elsewhere.

       <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_NO_WARNINGS</b>
              Set  to  TRUE  to  disable warnings about required library files that do not exist.  (For example,
              Visual Studio Express editions may not provide the redistributable files.)

       <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_COMPONENT</b>
              Added in version 3.3.

              Specify the <u>install(PROGRAMS)</u> command <b>COMPONENT</b> option.  If not specified, no such option will  be
              used.

       Added in version 3.10: Support for installing Intel compiler runtimes.

   <b>ProcessorCount</b>
       ProcessorCount(var)

       Determine the number of processors/cores and save value in ${var}

       Sets  the  variable  named  ${var}  to  the  number  of  physical  cores  available on the machine if the
       information can be determined.  Otherwise it is set to 0.  Currently this  functionality  is  implemented
       for AIX, cygwin, FreeBSD, HPUX, Linux, macOS, QNX, Sun and Windows.

       Changed in version 3.15: On Linux, returns the container CPU count instead of the host CPU count.

       This function is guaranteed to return a positive integer (&gt;=1) if it succeeds.  It returns 0 if there's a
       problem determining the processor count.

       More generally accurate physical CPU count can be obtained via <u>cmake_host_system_information()</u>:

          cmake_host_system_information(RESULT N
                                        QUERY NUMBER_OF_PHYSICAL_CORES)

       Example use, in a ctest -S dashboard script:

          include(ProcessorCount)
          ProcessorCount(N)
          if(NOT N EQUAL 0)
            set(CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS -j${N})
            set(ctest_test_args ${ctest_test_args} PARALLEL_LEVEL ${N})
          endif()

       This function is intended to offer an approximation of the value of the number of compute cores available
       on  the current machine, such that you may use that value for parallel building and parallel testing.  It
       is meant to help utilize as much of the machine as seems reasonable.  Of course, knowledge of  what  else
       might  be  running  on  the  machine  simultaneously  should  be  used when deciding whether to request a
       machine's full capacity all for yourself.

   <b>SelectLibraryConfigurations</b>
          select_library_configurations(basename)

       This macro takes a library base name as an argument, and will choose good values for the variables

          basename_LIBRARY
          basename_LIBRARIES
          basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG
          basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE

       depending on what has been found and set.

       If only <b>basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE</b> is defined, <b>basename_LIBRARY</b> will be  set  to  the  release  value,  and
       <b>basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG</b> will be set to <b>basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG-NOTFOUND</b>.  If only <b>basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG</b> is
       defined,  then  <b>basename_LIBRARY</b>  will  take the debug value, and <b>basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE</b> will be set to
       <b>basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE-NOTFOUND</b>.

       If the generator supports configuration types, then <b>basename_LIBRARY</b> and <b>basename_LIBRARIES</b> will  be  set
       with  debug  and  optimized  flags  specifying the library to be used for the given configuration.  If no
       build  type  has  been  set  or  the  generator  in  use  does  not  support  configuration  types,  then
       <b>basename_LIBRARY</b>  and  <b>basename_LIBRARIES</b>  will  take  only  the release value, or the debug value if the
       release one is not set.

   <b>SquishTestScript</b>
       This script launches a GUI test using Squish.  You should not call  the  script  directly;  instead,  you
       should access it via the SQUISH_ADD_TEST macro that is defined in FindSquish.cmake.

       This  script  starts  the  Squish  server,  launches the test on the client, and finally stops the squish
       server.  If any of these steps fail (including if the tests do not pass) then a fatal error is raised.

   <b>TestForANSIForScope</b>
       Check for ANSI for scope support

       Check if the compiler restricts the scope of variables declared in a for-init-statement to the loop body.

          CMAKE_NO_ANSI_FOR_SCOPE - holds result

   <b>TestForANSIStreamHeaders</b>
       Test for compiler support of ANSI stream headers iostream, etc.

       check if the compiler supports the standard ANSI iostream header (without the .h)

          CMAKE_NO_ANSI_STREAM_HEADERS - defined by the results

   <b>TestForSSTREAM</b>
       Test for compiler support of ANSI sstream header

       check if the compiler supports the standard ANSI sstream header

          CMAKE_NO_ANSI_STRING_STREAM - defined by the results

   <b>TestForSTDNamespace</b>
       Test for std:: namespace support

       check if the compiler supports std:: on stl classes

          CMAKE_NO_STD_NAMESPACE - defined by the results

   <b>UseEcos</b>
       This module defines variables and macros required to build eCos application.

       This file contains the following macros:

       <b>ECOS_ADD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES()</b>
              add the eCos include dirs

       <b>ECOS_ADD_EXECUTABLE(name</b> <b>source1</b> <b>...</b> <b>sourceN</b> <b>)</b>
              create an eCos executable

       <b>ECOS_ADJUST_DIRECTORY(VAR</b> <b>source1</b> <b>...</b> <b>sourceN</b> <b>)</b>
              adjusts the path of the source files and puts the result into <b>VAR</b>

       Macros for selecting the toolchain:

       <b>ECOS_USE_ARM_ELF_TOOLS()</b>
              enable the ARM ELF toolchain for the directory where it is called

       <b>ECOS_USE_I386_ELF_TOOLS()</b>
              enable the i386 ELF toolchain for the directory where it is called

       <b>ECOS_USE_PPC_EABI_TOOLS()</b>
              enable the PowerPC toolchain for the directory where it is called

       It contains the following variables:

       <b>ECOS_DEFINITIONS</b>

       <b>ECOSCONFIG_EXECUTABLE</b>

       <b>ECOS_CONFIG_FILE</b>
              defaults to ecos.ecc, if your eCos configuration file has a different name, adjust  this  variable
              for internal use only:

          ECOS_ADD_TARGET_LIB

                         )

              This command creates a <b>&lt;target_name&gt;.jar</b>.  It compiles the given <b>&lt;source&gt;</b> files and adds the given
              <b>&lt;resource&gt;</b> files to the jar file.  Source files can be java files or listing  files  (prefixed  by
              <b>@</b>).  If only resource files are given then just a jar file is created.

              <b>SOURCES</b>
                     Compiles the specified source files and adds the result in the jar file.

                     Added in version 3.4: Support for response files, prefixed by <b>@</b>.

              <b>RESOURCES</b>
                     Added in version 3.21.

                     Adds  the  named  <b>&lt;resource&gt;</b> files to the jar by stripping the source file path and placing
                     the file beneath <b>&lt;ns&gt;</b> within the jar.

                     For example:

                        RESOURCES NAMESPACE "/com/my/namespace" "a/path/to/resource.txt"

                     results in a resource accessible via <b>/com/my/namespace/resource.txt</b> within the jar.

                     Resources may be added without adjusting the namespace  by  adding  them  to  the  list  of
                     <b>SOURCES</b>   (original   behavior),   in  this  case,  resource  paths  must  be  relative  to
                     <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</b>.  Adding resources without using the <b>RESOURCES</b> parameter in out of
                     source builds will almost certainly result in confusion.

                     <b>NOTE:</b>
                        Adding resources via the <b>SOURCES</b>  parameter  relies  upon  a  hard-coded  list  of  file
                        extensions  which are tested to determine whether they compile (e.g. File.java). <b>SOURCES</b>
                        files which match the extensions are compiled. Files which do not match are  treated  as
                        resources.  To  include  uncompiled  resources  matching  those  file extensions use the
                        <b>RESOURCES</b> parameter.

              <b>INCLUDE_JARS</b>
                     The list of jars are added to the classpath when compiling the java sources and also to the
                     dependencies of the target.  <b>INCLUDE_JARS</b>  also  accepts  other  target  names  created  by
                     <b>add_jar()</b>.  For  backwards  compatibility, jar files listed as sources are ignored (as they
                     have been since the first version of this module).

              <b>ENTRY_POINT</b>
                     Defines an entry point in the jar file.

              <b>VERSION</b>
                     Adds a version to the target output name.

                     The following example will create a jar file with the name  <b>shibboleet-1.2.0.jar</b>  and  will
                     create a symlink <b>shibboleet.jar</b> pointing to the jar with the version information.

                        add_jar(shibboleet shibbotleet.java VERSION 1.2.0)

              <b>MANIFEST</b>
                     Defines a custom manifest for the jar.

              <b>OUTPUT_NAME</b>
                     Specify a different output name for the target.

              <b>OUTPUT_DIR</b>
                     Sets   the   directory   where   the   jar  file  will  be  generated.  If  not  specified,
                     <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u> is used as the output directory.

              <b>GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS</b>
                     Added in version 3.11.

                     Generates native header files for methods declared  as  native.  These  files  provide  the
                     connective  glue  that allow your Java and C code to interact.  An INTERFACE target will be
                     created for an easy usage of generated  files.   Sub-option  <b>DESTINATION</b>  can  be  used  to
                     specify the output directory for generated header files.

                     This option requires, at least, version 1.8 of the JDK.

                     For  an  optimum  usage  of this option, it is recommended to include module JNI before any
                     call to <b>add_jar()</b>. The produced target for native headers can then be used to compile C/C++
                     sources with the <u>target_link_libraries()</u> command.

                        find_package(JNI)
                        add_jar(foo foo.java GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS foo-native)
                        add_library(bar bar.cpp)
                        target_link_libraries(bar PRIVATE foo-native)

                     Added in version 3.20: <b>DESTINATION</b> sub-option  now  supports  the  possibility  to  specify
                     different  output  directories  for  <b>BUILD</b>  and  <b>INSTALL</b>  steps.  If <b>BUILD</b> directory is not
                     specified, a default directory will be used.

                     To export the interface target  generated  by  <b>GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS</b>  option,  sub-option
                     <b>INSTALL</b> of <b>DESTINATION</b> is required:

                        add_jar(foo foo.java GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS foo-native
                                             DESTINATION INSTALL include)
                        install(TARGETS foo-native EXPORT native)
                        install(DIRECTORY "$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:foo-native,NATIVE_HEADERS_DIRECTORY&gt;/"
                                DESTINATION include)
                        install(EXPORT native DESTINATION /to/export NAMESPACE foo)

              Some variables can be set to customize the behavior of <b>add_jar()</b> as well as the java compiler:

              <b>CMAKE_JAVA_COMPILE_FLAGS</b>
                     Specify additional flags to java compiler.

              <b>CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH</b>
                     Specify additional paths to the class path.

              <b>CMAKE_JNI_TARGET</b>
                     If  the target is a JNI library, sets this boolean variable to <b>TRUE</b> to enable creation of a
                     JNI symbolic link (see also <u>install_jni_symlink()</u>).

              <b>CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX</b>
                     If multiple jars should be produced from the same java  source  filetree,  to  prevent  the
                     accumulation    of    duplicate    class    files    in    subsequent    jars,    set/reset
                     <b>CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX</b> prior to calling the <b>add_jar()</b>:

                        set(CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX com/redhat/foo)
                        add_jar(foo foo.java)

                        set(CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX com/redhat/bar)
                        add_jar(bar bar.java)

              The <b>add_jar()</b> function sets the following target properties on <b>&lt;target_name&gt;</b>:

              <b>INSTALL_FILES</b>
                     The files which should be installed.  This is used by <u>install_jar()</u>.

              <b>JNI_SYMLINK</b>
                     The JNI symlink which should be installed.  This is used by <u>install_jni_symlink()</u>.

              <b>JAR_FILE</b>
                     The location of the jar file so that you can include it.

              <b>CLASSDIR</b>
                     The directory where the class files can be found.  For example to use them with <b>javah</b>.

              <b>NATIVE_HEADERS_DIRECTORY</b>
                     Added in version 3.20.

                     The   directory   where   native   headers   are    generated.    Defined    when    option
                     <b>GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS</b> is specified.

       <b>install_jar</b>
              This command installs the jar file to the given destination:

                 install_jar(&lt;target_name&gt; &lt;destination&gt;)
                 install_jar(&lt;target_name&gt; DESTINATION &lt;destination&gt; [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;])

              This  command  installs the <b>&lt;target_name&gt;</b> file to the given <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b>.  It should be called in
              the same scope as <u>add_jar()</u> or it will fail.

              Added in version 3.4: The second signature with <b>DESTINATION</b> and <b>COMPONENT</b> options.

              <b>DESTINATION</b>
                     Specify the directory on disk to which a file will be installed.

              <b>COMPONENT</b>
                     Specify an installation component name with which the install rule is associated,  such  as
                     "runtime" or "development".

              The <b>install_jar()</b> command sets the following target properties on <b>&lt;target_name&gt;</b>:

              <b>INSTALL_DESTINATION</b>
                     Holds the <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b> as described above, and is used by <u>install_jar_exports()</u>.

       <b>install_jni_symlink</b>
              Installs JNI symlinks for target generated by <u>add_jar()</u>:

                 install_jni_symlink(&lt;target_name&gt; &lt;destination&gt;)
                 install_jni_symlink(&lt;target_name&gt; DESTINATION &lt;destination&gt; [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;])

              This  command  installs  the  <b>&lt;target_name&gt;</b> JNI symlinks to the given <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b>.  It should be
              called in the same scope as <u>add_jar()</u> or it will fail.

              Added in version 3.4: The second signature with <b>DESTINATION</b> and <b>COMPONENT</b> options.

              <b>DESTINATION</b>
                     Specify the directory on disk to which a file will be installed.

              <b>COMPONENT</b>
                     Specify an installation component name with which the install rule is associated,  such  as
                     "runtime" or "development".

              Utilize the following commands to create a JNI symbolic link:

                 set(CMAKE_JNI_TARGET TRUE)
                 add_jar(shibboleet shibbotleet.java VERSION 1.2.0)
                 install_jar(shibboleet ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/shibboleet)
                 install_jni_symlink(shibboleet ${JAVA_LIB_INSTALL_DIR})

   <b>Header</b> <b>Generation</b>
       <b>create_javah</b>
              Added in version 3.4.

              Generates C header files for java classes:

                 create_javah(TARGET &lt;target&gt; | GENERATED_FILES &lt;VAR&gt;
                              CLASSES &lt;class&gt;...
                              [CLASSPATH &lt;classpath&gt;...]
                              [DEPENDS &lt;depend&gt;...]
                              [OUTPUT_NAME &lt;path&gt;|OUTPUT_DIR &lt;path&gt;]
                              )

              Deprecated  since  version 3.11: This command will no longer be supported starting with version 10
              of the JDK due to the <u>suppression</u> <u>of</u> <u>javah</u>  <u>tool</u>.   The  <u>add_jar(GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS)</u>  command
              should be used instead.

              Create  C  header files from java classes. These files provide the connective glue that allow your
              Java and C code to interact.

              There are two main signatures for <b>create_javah()</b>.  The first  signature  returns  generated  files
              through variable specified by the <b>GENERATED_FILES</b> option.  For example:

                 create_javah(GENERATED_FILES files_headers
                   CLASSES org.cmake.HelloWorld
                   CLASSPATH hello.jar
                 )

              The  second  signature  for  <b>create_javah()</b>  creates  a  target  which  encapsulates  header files
              generation. E.g.

                 create_javah(TARGET target_headers
                   CLASSES org.cmake.HelloWorld
                   CLASSPATH hello.jar
                 )

              Both signatures share same options.

              <b>CLASSES</b>
                     Specifies Java classes used to generate headers.

              <b>CLASSPATH</b>
                     Specifies various paths to look up classes. Here <b>.class</b> files, jar files or targets created
                     by command add_jar can be used.

              <b>DEPENDS</b>
                     Targets on which the javah target depends.

              <b>OUTPUT_NAME</b>
                     Concatenates the resulting header files for all the classes listed by option  <b>CLASSES</b>  into
                     <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>.  Same behavior as option <b>-o</b> of <b>javah</b> tool.

              <b>OUTPUT_DIR</b>
                     Sets the directory where the header files will be generated.  Same behavior as option <b>-d</b> of
                     <b>javah</b> tool.  If not specified, <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u> is used as the output directory.

   <b>Exporting</b> <b>JAR</b> <b>Targets</b>
       <b>install_jar_exports</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Installs a target export file:

                 install_jar_exports(TARGETS &lt;jars&gt;...
                                     [NAMESPACE &lt;namespace&gt;]
                                     FILE &lt;filename&gt;
                                     DESTINATION &lt;destination&gt; [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;])

              This  command  installs  a  target  export  file <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> for the named jar targets to the given
              <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b> directory.  Its function is similar to that of <u>install(EXPORT)</u>.

              <b>TARGETS</b>
                     List of targets created by <u>add_jar()</u> command.

              <b>NAMESPACE</b>
                     Added in version 3.9.

                     The <b>&lt;namespace&gt;</b> value will be prepend to the target names as they are written to the import
                     file.

              <b>FILE</b>   Specify name of the export file.

              <b>DESTINATION</b>
                     Specify the directory on disk to which a file will be installed.

              <b>COMPONENT</b>
                     Specify an installation component name with which the install rule is associated,  such  as
                     "runtime" or "development".

       <b>export_jars</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Writes a target export file:

                 export_jars(TARGETS &lt;jars&gt;...
                             [NAMESPACE &lt;namespace&gt;]
                             FILE &lt;filename&gt;)

              This command writes a target export file <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> for the named <b>&lt;jars&gt;</b> targets.  Its function is
              similar to that of <u>export()</u>.

              <b>TARGETS</b>
                     List of targets created by <u>add_jar()</u> command.

              <b>NAMESPACE</b>
                     Added in version 3.9.

                     The <b>&lt;namespace&gt;</b> value will be prepend to the target names as they are written to the import
                     file.

              <b>FILE</b>   Specify name of the export file.

   <b>Finding</b> <b>JARs</b>
       <b>find_jar</b>
              Finds the specified jar file:

                 find_jar(&lt;VAR&gt;
                          &lt;name&gt; | NAMES &lt;name1&gt; [&lt;name2&gt;...]
                          [PATHS &lt;path1&gt; [&lt;path2&gt;... ENV &lt;var&gt;]]
                          [VERSIONS &lt;version1&gt; [&lt;version2&gt;]]
                          [DOC "cache documentation string"]
                         )

              This  command  is  used  to  find  a  full path to the named jar.  A cache entry named by <b>&lt;VAR&gt;</b> is
              created to store the result of this command.  If the full path to a jar is  found  the  result  is
              stored  in  the  variable  and  the  search  will not repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If
              nothing is found, the result will be <b>&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND</b>, and the search will be attempted  again  next
              time <b>find_jar()</b> is invoked with the same variable.

              <b>NAMES</b>  Specify one or more possible names for the jar file.

              <b>PATHS</b>  Specify directories to search in addition to the default locations.  The <b>ENV</b> var sub-option
                     reads paths from a system environment variable.

              <b>VERSIONS</b>
                     Specify jar versions.

              <b>DOC</b>    Specify the documentation string for the <b>&lt;VAR&gt;</b> cache entry.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>Java</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       <b>create_javadoc</b>
              Creates java documentation based on files and packages:

                 create_javadoc(&lt;VAR&gt;
                                (PACKAGES &lt;pkg1&gt; [&lt;pkg2&gt;...] | FILES &lt;file1&gt; [&lt;file2&gt;...])
                                [SOURCEPATH &lt;sourcepath&gt;]
                                [CLASSPATH &lt;classpath&gt;]
                                [INSTALLPATH &lt;install path&gt;]
                                [DOCTITLE &lt;the documentation title&gt;]
                                [WINDOWTITLE &lt;the title of the document&gt;]
                                [AUTHOR (TRUE|FALSE)]
                                [USE (TRUE|FALSE)]
                                [VERSION (TRUE|FALSE)]
                                )

              The  <b>create_javadoc()</b>  command  can  be  used  to  create  java documentation.  There are two main
              signatures for <b>create_javadoc()</b>.

              The first signature works with package names on a path with source files:

                 create_javadoc(my_example_doc
                                PACKAGES com.example.foo com.example.bar
                                SOURCEPATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}"
                                CLASSPATH ${CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH}
                                WINDOWTITLE "My example"
                                DOCTITLE "&lt;h1&gt;My example&lt;/h1&gt;"
                                AUTHOR TRUE
                                USE TRUE
                                VERSION TRUE
                               )

              The second signature for <b>create_javadoc()</b> works on a given list of files:

                 create_javadoc(my_example_doc
                                FILES java/A.java java/B.java
                                CLASSPATH ${CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH}
                                WINDOWTITLE "My example"
                                DOCTITLE "&lt;h1&gt;My example&lt;/h1&gt;"
                                AUTHOR TRUE
                                USE TRUE
                                VERSION TRUE
                               )

              Both signatures share most of the options. For more details please read the javadoc manpage.

              <b>PACKAGES</b>
                     Specify java packages.

              <b>FILES</b>  Specify java  source  files.  If  relative  paths  are  specified,  they  are  relative  to
                     <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>.

              <b>SOURCEPATH</b>
                     Specify  the  directory  where  to  look for packages. By default, <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>
                     directory is used.

              <b>CLASSPATH</b>
                     Specify where to find user class files. Same behavior as option <b>-classpath</b> of <b>javadoc</b> tool.

              <b>INSTALLPATH</b>
                     Specify where to install the java documentation. If you specified, the  documentation  will
                     be installed to <b>${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/javadoc/&lt;VAR&gt;</b>.

              <b>DOCTITLE</b>
                     Specify  the  title  to  place near the top of the overview summary file.  Same behavior as
                     option <b>-doctitle</b> of <b>javadoc</b> tool.

              <b>WINDOWTITLE</b>
                     Specify the title  to  be  placed  in  the  HTML  <b>&lt;title&gt;</b>  tag.  Same  behavior  as  option
                     <b>-windowtitle</b> of <b>javadoc</b> tool.

              <b>AUTHOR</b> When  value  <b>TRUE</b>  is  specified,  includes  the  <b>@author</b>  text in the generated docs. Same
                     behavior as option  <b>-author</b> of <b>javadoc</b> tool.

              <b>USE</b>    When value <b>TRUE</b> is specified, creates class and package usage pages.  Includes one Use page
                     for each documented class and package. Same behavior as option <b>-use</b> of <b>javadoc</b> tool.

              <b>VERSION</b>
                     When value <b>TRUE</b> is specified, includes  the  version  text  in  the  generated  docs.  Same
                     behavior as option <b>-version</b> of <b>javadoc</b> tool.

   <b>UseSWIG</b>
       This file provides support for <b>SWIG</b>. It is assumed that <u>FindSWIG</u> module has already been loaded.

   <b>CMake</b> <b>Commands</b>
       The following command is defined for use with <b>SWIG</b>:

       <b>swig_add_library</b>
              Added in version 3.8.

              Define swig module with given name and specified language:

                 swig_add_library(&lt;name&gt;
                                  [TYPE &lt;SHARED|MODULE|STATIC|USE_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS&gt;]
                                  LANGUAGE &lt;language&gt;
                                  [NO_PROXY]
                                  [OUTPUT_DIR &lt;directory&gt;]
                                  [OUTFILE_DIR &lt;directory&gt;]
                                  SOURCES &lt;file&gt;...
                                 )

              Targets  created  with  the <b>swig_add_library</b> command have the same capabilities as targets created
              with the <u>add_library()</u> command, so those targets can be used with any command expecting  a  target
              (e.g.  <u>target_link_libraries()</u>).

              Changed  in  version  3.13:  This  command  creates a target with the specified <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> when policy
              <u>CMP0078</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>.  Otherwise, the legacy behavior will choose a  different  target  name  and
              store it in the <b>SWIG_MODULE_&lt;name&gt;_REAL_NAME</b> variable.

              Changed  in  version 3.15: Alternate library name (set with the <u>OUTPUT_NAME</u> property, for example)
              will be passed on to <b>Python</b> and <b>CSharp</b> wrapper libraries.

              Changed in version 3.21: Generated library use standard naming  conventions  for  <b>CSharp</b>  language
              when policy <u>CMP0122</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>. Otherwise, the legacy behavior is applied.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 For  multi-config  generators,  this  module  does  not  support  configuration-specific  files
                 generated by <b>SWIG</b>. All build configurations must result in the same generated source file.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 For <u>Makefile</u> <u>Generators</u>, if, for some sources, the  <b>USE_SWIG_DEPENDENCIES</b>  property  is  <b>FALSE</b>,
                 <b>swig_add_library</b>  does not track file dependencies, so depending on the <b>&lt;name&gt;_swig_compilation</b>
                 custom target is required for targets which require the <b>swig</b>-generated files  to  exist.  Other
                 generators may depend on the source files that would be generated by SWIG.

              <b>TYPE</b>   <b>SHARED</b>,  <b>MODULE</b>  and  <b>STATIC</b>  have  the  same semantic as for the <u>add_library()</u> command. If
                     <b>USE_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</b> is specified, the library type will be  <b>STATIC</b>  or  <b>SHARED</b>  based  on
                     whether the current value of the <u>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</u> variable is <b>ON</b>. If no type is specified,
                     <b>MODULE</b> will be used.

              <b>LANGUAGE</b>
                     Specify the target language.

                     Added in version 3.1: Go and Lua language support.

                     Added in version 3.2: R language support.

                     Added in version 3.18: Fortran language support.

              <b>NO_PROXY</b>
                     Added in version 3.12.

                     Prevent the generation of the wrapper layer (swig <b>-noproxy</b> option).

              <b>OUTPUT_DIR</b>
                     Added in version 3.12.

                     Specify where to write the language specific files (swig <b>-outdir</b> option). If not given, the
                     <b>CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR</b>  variable  will be used.  If neither is specified, the default depends on
                     the value of the <b>UseSWIG_MODULE_VERSION</b> variable as follows:

                     • If  <b>UseSWIG_MODULE_VERSION</b>  is  1  or  is   undefined,   output   is   written   to   the
                       <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u> directory.

                     • If  <b>UseSWIG_MODULE_VERSION</b>  is  2,  a dedicated directory will be used.  The path of this
                       directory can be retrieved from the <b>SWIG_SUPPORT_FILES_DIRECTORY</b> target property.

              <b>OUTFILE_DIR</b>
                     Added in version 3.12.

                     Specify an output directory name where the generated source file will be  placed  (swig  <b>-o</b>
                     option).  If  not  specified,  the  <b>SWIG_OUTFILE_DIR</b>  variable  will be used. If neither is
                     specified, <b>OUTPUT_DIR</b> or <b>CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR</b> is used instead.

              <b>SOURCES</b>
                     List of sources for the library. Files with extension <b>.i</b> will be identified as sources  for
                     the <b>SWIG</b> tool. Other files will be handled in the standard way.

                     Added  in  version  3.14:  This  behavior  can  be  overridden  by  specifying the variable
                     <b>SWIG_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS</b>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If <b>UseSWIG_MODULE_VERSION</b> is set to 2, it is <b>strongly</b> recommended to use a dedicated  directory
                 unique  to  the  target when either the <b>OUTPUT_DIR</b> option or the <b>CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR</b> variable are
                 specified.  The output directory contents are erased as part of the target build, so to prevent
                 interference between targets or losing other important files, each target should have  its  own
                 dedicated output directory.

   <b>Properties</b> <b>on</b> <b>Source</b> <b>Files</b>
       Source  file properties on module files <b>must</b> be set before the invocation of the <b>swig_add_library</b> command
       to specify special behavior of SWIG and ensure generated files will receive the required settings.

       <b>CPLUSPLUS</b>
              Call SWIG in c++ mode.  For example:

                 set_property(SOURCE mymod.i PROPERTY CPLUSPLUS ON)
                 swig_add_library(mymod LANGUAGE python SOURCES mymod.i)

       <b>SWIG_FLAGS</b>
              Deprecated since version 3.12: Replaced with the fine-grained properties that follow.

              Pass custom flags to the SWIG executable.

       <b>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES,</b> <b>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b> <b>and</b> <b>COMPILE_OPTIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              Add custom flags to SWIG compiler  and  have  same  semantic  as  properties  <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>,
              <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u> and <u>COMPILE_OPTIONS</u>.

       <b>USE_TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b>
              Added in version 3.13.

              If  set  to  <b>TRUE</b>,  contents  of  target  property  <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>  will be forwarded to <b>SWIG</b>
              compiler.  If set to <b>FALSE</b> target property <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u> will be ignored. If not set, target
              property <b>SWIG_USE_TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b> will be considered.

       <b>GENERATED_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES,</b> <b>GENERATED_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b> <b>and</b> <b>GENERATED_COMPILE_OPTIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              Add custom flags  to  the  C/C++  generated  source.  They  will  fill,  respectively,  properties
              <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>, <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u> and <u>COMPILE_OPTIONS</u> of generated C/C++ file.

       <b>DEPENDS</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              Specify additional dependencies to the source file.

       <b>USE_SWIG_DEPENDENCIES</b>
              Added in version 3.20.

              If set to <b>TRUE</b>, implicit dependencies are generated by the <b>swig</b> tool itself. This property is only
              meaningful for <u>Makefile</u>, <u>Ninja</u>, <u>Xcode</u>, and <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> generators.  Default value is <b>FALSE</b>.

              Added in version 3.21: Added the support of <u>Xcode</u> generator.

              Added in version 3.22: Added the support of <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>.

       <b>SWIG_MODULE_NAME</b>
              Specify  the  actual  import  name  of  the module in the target language.  This is required if it
              cannot be scanned automatically from source or different  from  the  module  file  basename.   For
              example:

                 set_property(SOURCE mymod.i PROPERTY SWIG_MODULE_NAME mymod_realname)

              Changed  in version 3.14: If policy <u>CMP0086</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>, <b>-module</b> <b>&lt;module_name&gt;</b> is passed to <b>SWIG</b>
              compiler.

       <b>OUTPUT_DIR</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              Specify where to write the language specific files (swig <b>-outdir</b> option) for the considered source
              file. If not specified, the other ways to define the  output  directory  applies  (see  <b>OUTPUT_DIR</b>
              option of <b>swig_add_library()</b> command).

       <b>OUTFILE_DIR</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              Specify  an  output  directory where the generated source file will be placed (swig <b>-o</b> option) for
              the considered source file. If not specified, <b>OUTPUT_DIR</b> source property will be used. If  neither
              are  specified,  the other ways to define output file directory applies (see <b>OUTFILE_DIR</b> option of
              <b>swig_add_library()</b> command).

   <b>Properties</b> <b>on</b> <b>Targets</b>
       Target library properties can be set to apply same configuration to all SWIG input files.

       <b>SWIG_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES,</b> <b>SWIG_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b> <b>and</b> <b>SWIG_COMPILE_OPTIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              These properties will be applied to all  SWIG  input  files  and  have  same  semantic  as  target
              properties <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>, <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u> and <u>COMPILE_OPTIONS</u>.

                 set (UseSWIG_TARGET_NAME_PREFERENCE STANDARD)
                 swig_add_library(mymod LANGUAGE python SOURCES mymod.i)
                 set_property(TARGET mymod PROPERTY SWIG_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS MY_DEF1 MY_DEF2)
                 set_property(TARGET mymod PROPERTY SWIG_COMPILE_OPTIONS -bla -blb)

       <b>SWIG_USE_TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b>
              Added in version 3.13.

              If  set  to  <b>TRUE</b>,  contents  of  target  property  <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>  will be forwarded to <b>SWIG</b>
              compiler.  If set to <b>FALSE</b> or not defined, target property <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>  will  be  ignored.
              This behavior can be overridden by specifying source property <b>USE_TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</b>.

       <b>SWIG_GENERATED_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES,</b> <b>SWIG_GENERATED_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b> <b>and</b> <b>SWIG_GENERATED_COMPILE_OPTIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              These  properties will populate, respectively, properties <u>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>, <u>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</u>
              and <u>COMPILE_FLAGS</u> of all generated C/C++ files.

       <b>SWIG_DEPENDS</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              Add dependencies to all SWIG input files.

   <b>Read-only</b> <b>Target</b> <b>Properties</b>
       The following target properties are output properties and can be used to get  information  about  support
       files generated by <b>SWIG</b> interface compilation.

       <b>SWIG_SUPPORT_FILES</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              This output property list of wrapper files generated during SWIG compilation.

                 set (UseSWIG_TARGET_NAME_PREFERENCE STANDARD)
                 swig_add_library(mymod LANGUAGE python SOURCES mymod.i)
                 get_property(support_files TARGET mymod PROPERTY SWIG_SUPPORT_FILES)

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Only  most  principal support files are listed. In case some advanced features of <b>SWIG</b> are used
                 (for example <b>%template</b>), associated support  files  may  not  be  listed.  Prefer  to  use  the
                 <b>SWIG_SUPPORT_FILES_DIRECTORY</b> property to handle support files.

       <b>SWIG_SUPPORT_FILES_DIRECTORY</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              This output property specifies the directory where support files will be generated.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 When  source  property  <b>OUTPUT_DIR</b> is defined, multiple directories can be specified as part of
                 <b>SWIG_SUPPORT_FILES_DIRECTORY</b>.

   <b>CMake</b> <b>Variables</b>
       Some variables can be set to customize the behavior of <b>swig_add_library</b> as well as <b>SWIG</b>:

       <b>UseSWIG_MODULE_VERSION</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              Specify different behaviors for <b>UseSWIG</b> module.

              • Set to 1 or undefined: Legacy behavior is applied.

              • Set to 2: A new strategy is applied regarding support files: the  output  directory  of  support
                files is erased before <b>SWIG</b> interface compilation.

       <b>CMAKE_SWIG_FLAGS</b>
              Add flags to all swig calls.

       <b>CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR</b>
              Specify where to write the language specific files (swig <b>-outdir</b> option).

       <b>SWIG_OUTFILE_DIR</b>
              Added in version 3.8.

              Specify  an  output  directory  name  where  the  generated  source  file  will be placed.  If not
              specified, <b>CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR</b> is used.

       <b>SWIG_MODULE_&lt;name&gt;_EXTRA_DEPS</b>
              Specify extra dependencies for the generated module for <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>.

       <b>SWIG_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.14.

              Specify a list of source file extensions to override the default behavior of considering  only  <b>.i</b>
              files as sources for the <b>SWIG</b> tool. For example:

                 set(SWIG_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS ".i" ".swg")

       <b>SWIG_USE_SWIG_DEPENDENCIES</b>
              Added in version 3.20.

              If set to <b>TRUE</b>, implicit dependencies are generated by the <b>swig</b> tool itself. This variable is only
              meaningful for <u>Makefile</u>, <u>Ninja</u>, <u>Xcode</u>, and <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> generators.  Default value is <b>FALSE</b>.

              Source  file property <b>USE_SWIG_DEPENDENCIES</b>, if not defined, will be initialized with the value of
              this variable.

              Added in version 3.21: Added the support of <u>Xcode</u> generator.

              Added in version 3.22: Added the support of <u>Visual</u> <u>Studio</u> <u>Generators</u>.

   <b>Deprecated</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>swig_link_libraries</b>
              Deprecated since version 3.13: Use <u>target_link_libraries()</u> with the standard target name, or  with
              <b>${SWIG_MODULE_&lt;name&gt;_REAL_NAME}</b> for legacy target naming.

              Link libraries to swig module:

                 swig_link_libraries(&lt;name&gt; &lt;item&gt;...)

              This command has same capabilities as <u>target_link_libraries()</u> command.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 When  policy  <u>CMP0078</u>  is  set  to  <b>NEW</b>,  <u>swig_add_library()</u> creates a standard target with the
                 specified <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> and <u>target_link_libraries()</u> must be used instead of this command.

                 With the legacy behavior (when <u>CMP0078</u> is set to  <b>OLD</b>  and  the  <b>UseSWIG_TARGET_NAME_PREFERENCE</b>
                 variable  is  set  to  <b>"LEGACY"</b>,  or  in CMake versions prior to 3.12), it is preferable to use
                 <b>target_link_libraries(${SWIG_MODULE_&lt;name&gt;_REAL_NAME}</b> <b>...)</b>  instead of this command.

   <b>UsewxWidgets</b>
       Convenience include for using wxWidgets library.

       Determines  if  wxWidgets  was  FOUND   and   sets   the   appropriate   libs,   incdirs,   flags,   etc.
       INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and LINK_DIRECTORIES are called.

       USAGE

          # Note that for MinGW users the order of libs is important!
          find_package(wxWidgets REQUIRED net gl core base)
          include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
          # and for each of your dependent executable/library targets:
          target_link_libraries(&lt;YourTarget&gt; ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})

       DEPRECATED

          LINK_LIBRARIES is not called in favor of adding dependencies per target.

   <b>FindAVIFile</b>
       Locate <u>AVIFILE</u> library and include paths.

       AVIFILE is a set of libraries for i386 machines to use various AVI codecs.   Support  is  limited  beyond
       Linux.  Windows provides native AVI support, and so doesn't need this library.  This module defines

          AVIFILE_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find avifile.h , etc.
          AVIFILE_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against
          AVIFILE_DEFINITIONS, definitions to use when compiling
          AVIFILE_FOUND, If false, don't try to use AVIFILE

   <b>FindBacktrace</b>
       Find provider for <u><a href="../man3/backtrace.3.html">backtrace</a>(3)</u>.

       Checks  if OS supports <b><a href="../man3/backtrace.3.html">backtrace</a>(3)</b> via either <b>libc</b> or custom library.  This module defines the following
       variables:

       <b>Backtrace_HEADER</b>
              The header file needed for <b><a href="../man3/backtrace.3.html">backtrace</a>(3)</b>. Cached.  Could be forcibly set by user.

       <b>Backtrace_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              The include directories needed to use <b><a href="../man3/backtrace.3.html">backtrace</a>(3)</b> header.

       <b>Backtrace_LIBRARIES</b>
              The libraries (linker flags) needed to use <b><a href="../man3/backtrace.3.html">backtrace</a>(3)</b>, if any.

       <b>Backtrace_FOUND</b>
              Is set if and only if <b><a href="../man3/backtrace.3.html">backtrace</a>(3)</b> support detected.

       The following cache variables are also available to set or use:

       <b>Backtrace_LIBRARY</b>
              The external library providing backtrace, if any.

       <b>Backtrace_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              The directory holding the <b><a href="../man3/backtrace.3.html">backtrace</a>(3)</b> header.

       Typical usage is to generate of header file using <u>configure_file()</u> with the contents like the following:

          #cmakedefine01 Backtrace_FOUND
          #if Backtrace_FOUND
          # include &lt;${Backtrace_HEADER}&gt;
          #endif

       And then reference that generated header file in actual source.

   <b>Imported</b> <b>Targets</b>
       Added in version 3.30.

       This module defines the following <u>IMPORTED</u> targets:

       <b>Backtrace::Backtrace</b>
              An interface library providing usage requirements for the found components.

   <b>FindBISON</b>
       Find <b>bison</b> executable and provide a macro to generate custom build rules.

       The module defines the following variables:

       <b>BISON_EXECUTABLE</b>
              path to the <b>bison</b> program

       <b>BISON_VERSION</b>
              version of <b>bison</b>

       <b>BISON_FOUND</b>
              "True" if the program was found

       The minimum  required  version  of  <b>bison</b>  can  be  specified  using  the  standard  CMake  syntax,  e.g.
       <u>find_package(BISON</u> <u>2.1.3)</u>.

       If <b>bison</b> is found, the module defines the macro:

          BISON_TARGET(&lt;Name&gt; &lt;YaccInput&gt; &lt;CodeOutput&gt;
                       [COMPILE_FLAGS &lt;flags&gt;]
                       [DEFINES_FILE &lt;file&gt;]
                       [VERBOSE [&lt;file&gt;]]
                       [REPORT_FILE &lt;file&gt;]
                       )

       which  will  create  a  custom  rule  to  generate  a  parser.   <b>&lt;YaccInput&gt;</b>  is the path to a yacc file.
       <b>&lt;CodeOutput&gt;</b> is the name of the source file generated by bison.  A header file is also be generated,  and
       contains the token list.

       Changed  in  version  3.14:  When  <u>CMP0088</u>  is  set  to  <b>NEW</b>,  <b>bison</b> runs in the <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u>
       directory.

       The options are:

       <b>COMPILE_FLAGS</b> <b>&lt;flags&gt;</b>
              Specify flags to be added to the <b>bison</b> command line.

       <b>DEFINES_FILE</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.4.

              Specify a non-default header <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> to be generated by <b>bison</b>.

       <b>VERBOSE</b> <b>[&lt;file&gt;]</b>
              Tell <b>bison</b> to write a report file of the grammar and parser.

              Deprecated since version 3.7: If <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> is given, it specifies path the report file is copied  to.
              <b>[&lt;file&gt;]</b> is left for backward compatibility of this module.  Use <b>VERBOSE</b> <b>REPORT_FILE</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>.

       <b>REPORT_FILE</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Specify a non-default report <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>, if generated.

       The macro defines the following variables:

       <b>BISON_&lt;Name&gt;_DEFINED</b>
              <b>True</b> is the macro ran successfully

       <b>BISON_&lt;Name&gt;_INPUT</b>
              The input source file, an alias for &lt;YaccInput&gt;

       <b>BISON_&lt;Name&gt;_OUTPUT_SOURCE</b>
              The source file generated by bison

       <b>BISON_&lt;Name&gt;_OUTPUT_HEADER</b>
              The header file generated by bison

       <b>BISON_&lt;Name&gt;_OUTPUTS</b>
              All files generated by bison including the source, the header and the report

       <b>BISON_&lt;Name&gt;_COMPILE_FLAGS</b>
              Options used in the <b>bison</b> command line

       Example usage:

          find_package(BISON)
          BISON_TARGET(MyParser parser.y ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.cpp
                       DEFINES_FILE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.h)
          add_executable(Foo main.cpp ${BISON_MyParser_OUTPUTS})

   <b>FindBLAS</b>
       Find Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) library

       This module finds an installed Fortran library that implements the <u>BLAS</u> <u>linear-algebra</u> <u>interface</u>.

       At least one of the <b>C</b>, <b>CXX</b>, or <b>Fortran</b> languages must be enabled.

              preferred

       <b>BLA_PKGCONFIG_BLAS</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              If set, the <b>pkg-config</b> method will look for this module name instead of just <b>blas</b>.

       <b>BLA_SIZEOF_INTEGER</b>
              Added in version 3.22.

              Specify the BLAS/LAPACK library integer size:

   <b>Intel</b> <b>MKL</b>
       To use the Intel MKL implementation of BLAS, a project  must  enable  at  least  one  of  the  <b>C</b>  or  <b>CXX</b>
       languages.     Set   <b>BLA_VENDOR</b>   to   an   Intel   MKL   variant   either   on   the   command-line   as
       <b>-DBLA_VENDOR=Intel10_64lp</b> or in project code:

          set(BLA_VENDOR Intel10_64lp)
          find_package(BLAS)

       In order to build a project using Intel MKL, and end user must first establish an Intel MKL environment:

       <b>Intel</b> <b>oneAPI</b>
              Source the full Intel environment script:

                 . /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh

              Or, source the MKL component environment script:

                 . /opt/intel/oneapi/mkl/latest/env/vars.sh

       <b>Intel</b> <b>Classic</b>
              Source the full Intel environment script:

                 . /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64

              Or, source the MKL component environment script:

                 . /opt/intel/mkl/bin/mklvars.sh intel64

       The above environment scripts set the <b>MKLROOT</b> environment variable to the top of  the  MKL  installation.
       They  also  add  the location of the runtime libraries to the dynamic library loader environment variable
       for your platform (e.g. <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>).  This is necessary for programs linked against MKL to run.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          As of Intel oneAPI 2021.2, loading only the MKL component  does  not  make  all  of  its  dependencies
          available.  In particular, the <b>iomp5</b> library must be available separately, or provided by also loading
          the compiler component environment:

              . /opt/intel/oneapi/compiler/latest/env/vars.sh

   <b>FindBullet</b>

   <b>FindCUDAToolkit</b>
       Added in version 3.17.

       This script locates the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit and the associated libraries, but does not require  the  <b>CUDA</b>
       language be enabled for a given project. This module does not search for the NVIDIA CUDA Samples.

       Added in version 3.19: QNX support.

   <b>Search</b> <b>Behavior</b>
       The CUDA Toolkit search behavior uses the following order:

       1. If  the  <b>CUDA</b> language has been enabled we will use the directory containing the compiler as the first
          search location for <b>nvcc</b>.

       2. If the variable <u>CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER</u> or the environment variable <u>CUDACXX</u> is defined, it will be used as
          the path to the <b>nvcc</b> executable.

       3. If  the  <b>CUDAToolkit_ROOT</b>  cmake  configuration  variable  (e.g.,  <b>-DCUDAToolkit_ROOT=/some/path</b>)   <u>or</u>
          environment  variable  is  defined,  it  will  be  searched.   If  both  an environment variable <b>and</b> a
          configuration variable are specified, the <u>configuration</u> variable takes precedence.

          The directory specified here must be such that the executable <b>nvcc</b> or the appropriate  <b>version.txt</b>  or
          <b>version.json</b> file can be found underneath the specified directory.

       4. If the CUDA_PATH environment variable is defined, it will be searched for <b>nvcc</b>.

       5. The  user's  path  is  searched for <b>nvcc</b> using <u>find_program()</u>.  If this is found, no subsequent search
          attempts are performed.  Users are responsible for ensuring that the first <b>nvcc</b> to show up in the path
          is the desired path in the event that multiple CUDA Toolkits are installed.

       6. On Unix systems, if the symbolic link <b>/usr/local/cuda</b> exists, this  is  used.   No  subsequent  search
          attempts are performed.  No default symbolic link location exists for the Windows platform.

       7. The platform specific default install locations are searched.  If exactly one candidate is found, this
          is used.  The default CUDA Toolkit install locations searched are:

          Where  <b>X.Y</b>  would be a specific version of the CUDA Toolkit, such as <b>/usr/local/cuda-9.0</b> or <b>C:\Program</b>
          <b>Files\NVIDIA</b> <b>GPU</b> <b>Computing</b> <b>Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0</b>

          <b>NOTE:</b>
             When multiple CUDA Toolkits are  installed  in  the  default  location  of  a  system  (e.g.,  both
             <b>/usr/local/cuda-9.0</b>  and  <b>/usr/local/cuda-10.0</b> exist but the <b>/usr/local/cuda</b> symbolic link does <b>not</b>
             exist), this package is marked as <b>not</b> found.

             There are too many factors involved in making an automatic decision in  the  presence  of  multiple
             CUDA  Toolkits  being  installed.   In  this  situation,  users  are  encouraged  to either (1) set
             <b>CUDAToolkit_ROOT</b>  or  (2)  ensure  that  the  correct  <b>nvcc</b>  executable  shows  up  in  <b>$PATH</b>   for
             <u>find_program()</u> to find.

   <b>Arguments</b>
       <b>[&lt;version&gt;]</b>
              The <b>[&lt;version&gt;]</b> argument requests a version with which the package found should be compatible. See
              <u>find_package</u> <u>version</u> <u>format</u> for more details.

   <b>Options</b>
       <b>REQUIRED</b>
              If specified, configuration will error if a suitable CUDA Toolkit is not found.

       <b>QUIET</b>  If specified, the search for a suitable CUDA Toolkit will not produce any messages.

       <b>EXACT</b>  If  specified,  the  CUDA  Toolkit  is  considered  found  only  if the exact <b>VERSION</b> specified is
              recovered.

   <b>IMPORTED</b> <b>Targets</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       This module defines <u>IMPORTED</u> target <b>CURL::libcurl</b>, if curl has been found.

   <b>Result</b> <b>Variables</b>
       This module defines the following variables:

       <b>CURL_FOUND</b>
              "True" if <b>curl</b> found.

       The module defines the following variables:

          CVS_EXECUTABLE - path to cvs command line client
          CVS_FOUND - true if the command line client was found

       Example usage:

          find_package(CVS)
          if(CVS_FOUND)
            message("CVS found: ${CVS_EXECUTABLE}")

              generator is used.  Valid only for CxxTest version 3.

              In older versions of this Find Module, this variable controlled if the Python test  generator  was
              used instead of the Perl one, regardless of which scripting language the user had installed.

       <b>CXXTEST_TESTGEN_ARGS</b>
              Added in version 2.8.3.

              Specify  a list of options to pass to the CxxTest code generator.  If not defined, <b>--error-printer</b>
              is passed.

   <b>Result</b> <b>Variables</b>

              be executed using its shebang line.

   <b>Module</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>cxxtest_add_test</b>
              Create a CxxTest runner and adds it to the CTest testing suite:

                 CXXTEST_ADD_TEST(&lt;test_name&gt; &lt;gen_source_file&gt;
                                  &lt;input_files_to_testgen&gt;...)

              Parameters:

              <b>test_name</b>
                     The name of the test

              <b>gen_source_file</b>
                     The generated source filename to be generated by CxxTest

                     The list of header files containing the CxxTest::TestSuite's to be included in this runner

   <b>Example</b> <b>Usage</b>
       The following example, if CxxTest is found, will:

       • Invoke  the  testgen executable to autogenerate foo_test.cc in the binary tree from "foo_test.h" in the
         current source directory.

       • Create an executable and test called unittest_foo.

          find_package(CxxTest)
          if(CXXTEST_FOUND)
            include_directories(${CXXTEST_INCLUDE_DIR})
            enable_testing()
            CXXTEST_ADD_TEST(unittest_foo foo_test.cc
                             ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/foo_test.h)
            target_link_libraries(unittest_foo foo) # as needed
          endif()

       <b>foo_test.h</b> contains:

          #include &lt;cxxtest/TestSuite.h&gt;
          class MyTestSuite : public CxxTest::TestSuite
          {
          public:
             void testAddition( void )
             {
                TS_ASSERT( 1 + 1 &gt; 1 );
                TS_ASSERT_EQUALS( 1 + 1, 2 );
             }
          };

   <b>FindCygwin</b>
       Find Cygwin, a POSIX-compatible environment that runs natively on Microsoft Windows

   <b>FindDCMTK</b>
       Find DICOM ToolKit (DCMTK) libraries and applications

       The module defines the following variables:

          DCMTK_INCLUDE_DIRS  - Directories to include to use DCMTK
          DCMTK_LIBRARIES     - Files to link against to use DCMTK
          DCMTK_FOUND         - If false, don't try to use DCMTK
          DCMTK_DIR           - (optional) Source directory for DCMTK

   <b>Compatibility</b>
       This module is able to find a version of DCMTK that does or does not export a <b>DCMTKConfig.cmake</b> file.  It
       applies a two step process:

       • Step 1:  Attempt to find DCMTK version providing a <b>DCMTKConfig.cmake</b> file.

       • Step 2:  If step 1 failed, rely on <b>FindDCMTK.cmake</b> to set <b>DCMTK_*</b> variables details below.

       <u>Recent</u>  <u>DCMTK</u>  provides  a  <b>DCMTKConfig.cmake</b>  <u>package</u> <u>configuration</u> <u>file</u>. To exclusively use the package
       configuration file (recommended when possible), pass the <u>NO_MODULE</u> option to <u>find_package()</u>. For example,
       <u>find_package(DCMTK</u> <u>NO_MODULE)</u>.  This requires official DCMTK snapshot <u>3.6.1_20140617</u> or newer.

       Until all clients update to the more recent DCMTK, build systems will need to support different  versions
       of DCMTK.

       On any given system, the following combinations of DCMTK versions could be considered:
                             ┌────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────┐

   <b>FindDevIL</b>
       This module locates the Developer's Image Library, <u>DevIL</u>.

   <b>IMPORTED</b> <b>Targets</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       This module defines the <u>IMPORTED</u> targets:

       <b>DevIL::IL</b>
              Defined if the system has DevIL.

       <b>DevIL::ILU</b>
              Defined if the system has DevIL Utilities.

       <b>DevIL::ILUT</b>
              Defined if the system has DevIL Utility Toolkit.

   <b>Result</b> <b>Variables</b>
       This module sets:

       <b>IL_LIBRARIES</b>
              The name of the IL library. These include the full path to the core DevIL library. This one has to
              be linked into the application.

       <b>ILU_LIBRARIES</b>
              The  name  of  the ILU library. Again, the full path. This library is for filters and effects, not
              actual loading. It doesn't have to be linked if the functionality it provides is not used.

       <b>ILUT_LIBRARIES</b>
              The name of the ILUT library. Full path. This part of the library interfaces with  OpenGL.  It  is
              not strictly needed in applications.

       <b>IL_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              where to find the il.h, ilu.h and ilut.h files.

       <b>DevIL_FOUND</b>
              This is set to TRUE if all the above variables were set.  This will be set to false if ILU or ILUT
              are  not  found,  even  if  they  are not needed. In most systems, if one library is found all the
              others are as well. That's the way the DevIL developers release it.

       <b>DevIL_ILUT_FOUND</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              This is set to TRUE if the ILUT library is found.

   <b>FindDoxygen</b>
       Doxygen is a documentation generation tool (see <u>https://www.doxygen.nl</u>).  This module looks  for  Doxygen
       and some optional tools it supports:

       <b>dot</b>    <u>Graphviz</u> <b>dot</b> utility used to render various graphs.

       <b>mscgen</b> <u>Message</u> <u>Chart</u> <u>Generator</u> utility used by Doxygen's <b>\msc</b> and <b>\mscfile</b> commands.

       <b>dia</b>    <u>Dia</u> the diagram editor used by Doxygen's <b>\diafile</b> command.

       Added  in  version  3.9:  These  tools  are  available  as components in the <u>find_package()</u> command.  For
       example:

          # Require dot, treat the other components as optional
          find_package(Doxygen
                       REQUIRED dot
                       OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS mscgen dia)

       The following variables are defined by this module:

       <b>DOXYGEN_FOUND</b>
              True if the <b>doxygen</b> executable was found.

       <b>DOXYGEN_VERSION</b>
              The version reported by <b>doxygen</b> <b>--version</b>.

       Added in version 3.9: The module defines <b>IMPORTED</b> targets for Doxygen and each  component  found.   These
       can  be used as part of custom commands, etc. and should be preferred over old-style (and now deprecated)
       variables like <b>DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE</b>. The following  import  targets  are  defined  if  their  corresponding
       executable  could  be  found  (the  component  import  targets will only be defined if that component was
       requested):

          Doxygen::doxygen
          Doxygen::dot
          Doxygen::mscgen
          Doxygen::dia

   <b>Functions</b>
       <b>doxygen_add_docs</b>
              Added in version 3.9.

              This function is intended as a convenience for adding a target for generating  documentation  with
              Doxygen.  It  aims  to  provide  sensible defaults so that projects can generally just provide the
              input files and directories and that will be sufficient to give  sensible  results.  The  function
              supports the ability to customize the Doxygen configuration used to build the documentation.

                 doxygen_add_docs(targetName
                     [filesOrDirs...]
                     [ALL]
                     [USE_STAMP_FILE]
                     [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                     [COMMENT comment]
                     [CONFIG_FILE filename])

              The function constructs a <b>Doxyfile</b> and defines a custom target that runs Doxygen on that generated
              file.  The  listed  files and directories are used as the <b>INPUT</b> of the generated <b>Doxyfile</b> and they
              can contain wildcards.  Any files that are listed explicitly will also be added as <b>SOURCES</b> of  the
              custom target so they will show up in an IDE project's source list.

              So  that  relative  input  paths work as expected, by default the working directory of the Doxygen
              command will be the  current  source  directory  (i.e.   <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR</u>).  This  can  be
              overridden  with  the  <b>WORKING_DIRECTORY</b>  option to change the directory used as the relative base
              point. Note also that Doxygen's default behavior is to strip the working directory  from  relative
              paths in the generated documentation (see the <b>STRIP_FROM_PATH</b> <u>Doxygen</u> <u>config</u> <u>option</u> for details).

              If  provided,  the  optional  <b>comment</b>  will  be  passed as the <b>COMMENT</b> for the <u>add_custom_target()</u>
              command used to create the custom target internally.

              Added in version 3.27: If <b>CONFIG_FILE</b> is set, the given file provided with full-path will be  used
              as doxygen configuration file

              Added in version 3.12: If <b>ALL</b> is set, the target will be added to the default build target.

              Added  in version 3.16: If <b>USE_STAMP_FILE</b> is set, the custom command defined by this function will
              create a stamp file with the name <b>&lt;targetName&gt;.stamp</b> in  the  current  binary  directory  whenever
              doxygen  is  re-run.   With this option present, all items in <b>&lt;filesOrDirs&gt;</b> must be files (i.e. no
              directories,  symlinks  or  wildcards)  and  each  of  the  files   must   exist   at   the   time
              <b>doxygen_add_docs()</b> is called.  An error will be raised if any of the items listed is missing or is
              not  a  file  when  <b>USE_STAMP_FILE</b> is given.  A dependency will be created on each of the files so
              that doxygen will only be re-run if one of the  files  is  updated.   Without  the  <b>USE_STAMP_FILE</b>
              option,  doxygen  will  always be re-run if the <b>&lt;targetName&gt;</b> target is built regardless of whether
              anything listed in <b>&lt;filesOrDirs&gt;</b> has changed.

              The contents of the generated <b>Doxyfile</b> can be customized by setting CMake variables before calling
              <b>doxygen_add_docs()</b>. Any variable with a name  of  the  form  <b>DOXYGEN_&lt;tag&gt;</b>  will  have  its  value
              substituted  for  the  corresponding  <b>&lt;tag&gt;</b>  configuration option in the <b>Doxyfile</b>. See the <u>Doxygen</u>
              <u>documentation</u> for the full list of supported configuration options.

              Some of Doxygen's defaults are overridden  to  provide  more  appropriate  behavior  for  a  CMake
              project.  Each  of  the  following  will be explicitly set unless the variable already has a value
              before <b>doxygen_add_docs()</b> is called (with some exceptions noted):

              <b>DOXYGEN_HAVE_DOT</b>
                     Set to <b>YES</b> if the <b>dot</b> component was requested and it was found, <b>NO</b> otherwise. Any  existing
                     value of <b>DOXYGEN_HAVE_DOT</b> is ignored.

              <b>DOXYGEN_DOT_MULTI_TARGETS</b>
                     Set  to  <b>YES</b> by this module (note that this requires a <b>dot</b> version newer than 1.8.10). This
                     option is only meaningful if <b>DOXYGEN_HAVE_DOT</b> is also set to <b>YES</b>.

              <b>DOXYGEN_GENERATE_LATEX</b>
                     Set to <b>NO</b> by this module.

              <b>DOXYGEN_WARN_FORMAT</b>
                     For Visual Studio based generators, this is set to the form recognized by the Visual Studio
                     IDE: <b>$file($line)</b> <b>:</b> <b>$text</b>. For  all  other  generators,  Doxygen's  default  value  is  not
                     overridden.

              <b>DOXYGEN_PROJECT_NAME</b>
                     Populated with the name of the current project (i.e.  <u>PROJECT_NAME</u>).

              <b>DOXYGEN_PROJECT_NUMBER</b>
                     Populated with the version of the current project (i.e.  <u>PROJECT_VERSION</u>).

              <b>DOXYGEN_PROJECT_BRIEF</b>
                     Populated with the description of the current project (i.e.  <u>PROJECT_DESCRIPTION</u>).

              <b>DOXYGEN_INPUT</b>
                     Projects  should  not  set  this  variable.  It will be populated with the set of files and
                     directories passed to <b>doxygen_add_docs()</b>, thereby providing consistent  behavior  with  the
                     other  built-in commands like <u>add_executable()</u>, <u>add_library()</u> and <u>add_custom_target()</u>. If a
                     variable named <b>DOXYGEN_INPUT</b> is set by the project, it will be ignored and a  warning  will
                     be issued.

              <b>DOXYGEN_RECURSIVE</b>
                     Set to <b>YES</b> by this module.

              <b>DOXYGEN_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS</b>
                     If  the  set  of  inputs  includes directories, this variable will specify patterns used to
                     exclude files from them. The following patterns are added by <b>doxygen_add_docs()</b>  to  ensure
                     CMake-specific  files  and  directories  are not included in the input. If the project sets
                     <b>DOXYGEN_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS</b>, those contents are merged with these additional  patterns  rather
                     than replacing them:

                        */.git/*
                        */.svn/*
                        */.hg/*
                        */CMakeFiles/*
                        */_CPack_Packages/*
                        DartConfiguration.tcl
                        CMakeLists.txt
                        CMakeCache.txt

              <b>DOXYGEN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</b>
                     Set  to  <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u> by this module. Note that if the project provides its own
                     value for this and it is a relative path, it will be converted to an absolute path relative
                     to the current binary directory. This is necessary because doxygen  will  normally  be  run
                     from  a directory within the source tree so that relative source paths work as expected. If
                     this directory does not exist, it will  be  recursively  created  prior  to  executing  the
                     doxygen commands.

       To  change  any  of  these  defaults  or override any other Doxygen config option, set relevant variables
       before calling <b>doxygen_add_docs()</b>. For example:

              set(DOXYGEN_GENERATE_HTML NO)
              set(DOXYGEN_GENERATE_MAN YES)

              doxygen_add_docs(
                  doxygen
                  ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}
                  COMMENT "Generate man pages"
              )

       A number of Doxygen config options accept lists of values, but Doxygen requires them to be  separated  by
       whitespace.  CMake  variables hold lists as a string with items separated by semi-colons, so a conversion
       needs to be performed. The <b>doxygen_add_docs()</b> command specifically checks the  following  Doxygen  config
       options  and will convert their associated CMake variable's contents into the required form if set. CMake
       variables are named <b>DOXYGEN_&lt;name&gt;</b> for the Doxygen settings specified here.

       Added in version 3.11: There are situations where it may be undesirable for a particular config option to
       be automatically quoted by <b>doxygen_add_docs()</b>, such as <b>ALIASES</b> which may need to include its own embedded
       quoting.   The  <b>DOXYGEN_VERBATIM_VARS</b>  variable  can  be  used  to  specify  a  list of Doxygen variables
       (including the leading <b>DOXYGEN_</b> prefix) which should not be quoted.  The project is then responsible  for
       ensuring  that those variables' values make sense when placed directly in the Doxygen input file.  In the
       case of list variables, list items are still separated by spaces, it is only the automatic  quoting  that
       is   skipped.    For   example,   the   following   allows   <b>doxygen_add_docs()</b>   to   apply  quoting  to
       <b>DOXYGEN_PROJECT_BRIEF</b>, but not each item in the <b>DOXYGEN_ALIASES</b> list (<u>bracket</u> <u>syntax</u> can also be used  to
       make working with embedded quotes easier):

          set(DOXYGEN_PROJECT_BRIEF "String with spaces")
          set(DOXYGEN_ALIASES
              [[somealias="@some_command param"]]
              "anotherAlias=@foobar"
          )
          set(DOXYGEN_VERBATIM_VARS DOXYGEN_ALIASES)

       The resultant <b>Doxyfile</b> will contain the following lines:

          PROJECT_BRIEF = "String with spaces"
          ALIASES       = somealias="@some_command param" anotherAlias=@foobar

   <b>Deprecated</b> <b>Result</b> <b>Variables</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.9.

       For  compatibility with previous versions of CMake, the following variables are also defined but they are
       deprecated and should no longer be used:

       <b>DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE</b>
              The path to the <b>doxygen</b> command. If projects need to refer to  the  <b>doxygen</b>  executable  directly,
              they should use the <b>Doxygen::doxygen</b> import target instead.

       <b>DOXYGEN_DOT_FOUND</b>
              True if the <b>dot</b> executable was found.

       <b>DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE</b>
              The path to the <b>dot</b> command. If projects need to refer to the <b>dot</b> executable directly, they should
              use the <b>Doxygen::dot</b> import target instead.

       <b>DOXYGEN_DOT_PATH</b>
              The path to the directory containing the <b>dot</b> executable as reported in <b>DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE</b>. The
              path  may  have forward slashes even on Windows and is not suitable for direct substitution into a
              <b>Doxyfile.in</b> template.  If  you  need  this  value,  get  the  <u>IMPORTED_LOCATION</u>  property  of  the
              <b>Doxygen::dot</b>  target  and use <u>get_filename_component()</u> to extract the directory part of that path.
              You may also want to consider using  <u>file(TO_NATIVE_PATH)</u>  to  prepare  the  path  for  a  Doxygen
              configuration file.

   <b>Deprecated</b> <b>Hint</b> <b>Variables</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.9.

       <b>DOXYGEN_SKIP_DOT</b>
              This  variable  has  no  effect for the component form of <b>find_package</b>.  In backward compatibility
              mode (i.e. without components list) it prevents the finder module from  searching  for  Graphviz's
              <b>dot</b> utility.

   <b>FindEnvModules</b>
       Added in version 3.15.

       Locate  an  environment  module  implementation and make commands available to CMake scripts to use them.
       This is compatible with both Lua-based Lmod and TCL-based EnvironmentModules.

       This module is intended for the use case of setting up the compiler  and  library  environment  within  a
       <u>CTest</u> <u>Script</u> (<b>ctest</b> <b>-S</b>).  It can also be used in a <u>CMake</u> <u>Script</u> (<b>cmake</b> <b>-P</b>).

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The  loaded  environment will not survive past the end of the calling process.  Do not use this module
          in project code (<b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files) to load a compiler environment; it will not be available during
          the build.  Instead load the environment manually before running CMake or using  the  generated  build
          system.

   <b>Example</b> <b>Usage</b>
          set(CTEST_BUILD_NAME "CrayLinux-CrayPE-Cray-dynamic")
          set(CTEST_BUILD_CONFIGURATION Release)
          set(CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS "-k -j8")
          set(CTEST_CMAKE_GENERATOR "Unix Makefiles")

          ...

          find_package(EnvModules REQUIRED)

          env_module(purge)
          env_module(load modules)
          env_module(load craype)
          env_module(load PrgEnv-cray)
          env_module(load craype-knl)
          env_module(load cray-mpich)
          env_module(load cray-libsci)

          set(ENV{CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE} dynamic)

          ...

   <b>Result</b> <b>Variables</b>
       This module will set the following variables in your project:

       <b>EnvModules_FOUND</b>
              True if a compatible environment modules framework was found.

   <b>Cache</b> <b>Variables</b>
       The following cache variable will be set:

       <b>EnvModules_COMMAND</b>
              The  low  level module command to use.  Currently supported implementations are the Lua based Lmod
              and TCL based EnvironmentModules.

   <b>Environment</b> <b>Variables</b>
       <b>ENV{MODULESHOME}</b>
              Usually set by the module environment implementation, used as a hint to locate the module  command
              to execute.

   <b>Provided</b> <b>Functions</b>
       This defines the following CMake functions for interacting with environment modules:

       <b>env_module</b>
              Execute an arbitrary module command:

                 env_module(cmd arg1 ... argN)
                 env_module(
                   COMMAND cmd arg1 ... argN
                   [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;out-var&gt;]
                   [RESULT_VARIABLE &lt;ret-var&gt;]
                 )

              The options are:

              <b>cmd</b> <b>arg1</b> <b>...</b> <b>argN</b>
                     The  module  sub-command  and  arguments  to execute as if they were passed directly to the
                     module command in your shell environment.

              <b>OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> <b>&lt;out-var&gt;</b>
                     The standard output from executing the module command.

              <b>RESULT_VARIABLE</b> <b>&lt;ret-var&gt;</b>
                     The return code from executing the module command.

       <b>env_module_swap</b>
              Swap one module for another:

                 env_module_swap(out_mod in_mod
                   [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;out-var&gt;]
                   [RESULT_VARIABLE &lt;ret-var&gt;]
                 )

              This is functionally equivalent to the <b>module</b> <b>swap</b> <b>out_mod</b> <b>in_mod</b> shell command.  The options are:

              <b>OUTPUT_VARIABLE</b> <b>&lt;out-var&gt;</b>
                     The standard output from executing the module command.

              <b>RESULT_VARIABLE</b> <b>&lt;ret-var&gt;</b>
                     The return code from executing the module command.

       <b>env_module_list</b>
              Retrieve the list of currently loaded modules:

                 env_module_list(&lt;out-var&gt;)

              This is functionally equivalent to the <b>module</b>  <b>list</b>  shell  command.   The  result  is  stored  in
              <b>&lt;out-var&gt;</b> as a properly formatted CMake <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> variable.

       <b>env_module_avail</b>
              Retrieve the list of available modules:

                 env_module_avail([&lt;mod-prefix&gt;] &lt;out-var&gt;)

              This  is  functionally  equivalent  to the <b>module</b> <b>avail</b> <b>&lt;mod-prefix&gt;</b> shell command.  The result is
              stored in <b>&lt;out-var&gt;</b> as a properly formatted CMake <u>semicolon-separated</u> <u>list</u> variable.

   <b>FindEXPAT</b>
       Find the native Expat headers and library.  Expat is a stream-oriented XML parser library written in C.

   <b>Imported</b> <b>Targets</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       This module defines the following <u>IMPORTED</u> targets:

       <b>EXPAT::EXPAT</b>
              The Expat <b>expat</b> library, if found.

   <b>Result</b> <b>Variables</b>
       This module will set the following variables in your project:

       <b>EXPAT_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              where to find expat.h, etc.

       <b>EXPAT_LIBRARIES</b>
              the libraries to link against to use Expat.

       <b>EXPAT_FOUND</b>
              true if the Expat headers and libraries were found.

   <b>Hints</b>
       <b>EXPAT_USE_STATIC_LIBS</b>
          Added in version 3.28.

          Set to <b>TRUE</b> to use static libraries.

          Added in version 3.31: Implemented on non-Windows platforms.

   <b>FindFLEX</b>
       Find Fast Lexical Analyzer (Flex) executable and provides a macro to generate custom build rules

       The module defines the following variables:

          FLEX_FOUND - True is flex executable is found
          FLEX_EXECUTABLE - the path to the flex executable
          FLEX_VERSION - the version of flex
          FLEX_LIBRARIES - The flex libraries
          FLEX_INCLUDE_DIRS - The path to the flex headers

       The minimum required version of flex can be specified using the standard syntax, e.g.   <u>find_package(FLEX</u>
       <u>2.5.13)</u>

       If flex is found on the system, the module provides the macro:

          FLEX_TARGET(Name FlexInput FlexOutput
                      [COMPILE_FLAGS &lt;string&gt;]
                      [DEFINES_FILE &lt;string&gt;]
                      )

       which creates a custom command to generate the <b>FlexOutput</b> file from the <b>FlexInput</b> file.  Name is an alias
       used  to get details of this custom command.  If <b>COMPILE_FLAGS</b> option is specified, the next parameter is
       added to the flex command line.

       Added in version 3.5: If flex is configured to output a header file, the <b>DEFINES_FILE</b> option may be  used
       to specify its name.

       Changed in version 3.17: When <u>CMP0098</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>, <b>flex</b> runs in the <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u> directory.

       The macro defines the following variables:

          FLEX_${Name}_DEFINED - true is the macro ran successfully
          FLEX_${Name}_OUTPUTS - the source file generated by the custom rule, an
          alias for FlexOutput
          FLEX_${Name}_INPUT - the flex source file, an alias for ${FlexInput}
          FLEX_${Name}_OUTPUT_HEADER - the header flex output, if any.

       Flex  scanners  often  use  tokens  defined  by  Bison:  the code generated by Flex depends of the header
       generated by Bison.  This module also defines a macro:

          ADD_FLEX_BISON_DEPENDENCY(FlexTarget BisonTarget)

       which adds the required dependency between a scanner and a parser where <b>FlexTarget</b>  and  <b>BisonTarget</b>  are
       the first parameters of respectively <b>FLEX_TARGET</b> and <b>BISON_TARGET</b> macros.

          ====================================================================
          Example:

          find_package(BISON)
          find_package(FLEX)

          BISON_TARGET(MyParser parser.y ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.cpp)
          FLEX_TARGET(MyScanner lexer.l  ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/lexer.cpp)
          ADD_FLEX_BISON_DEPENDENCY(MyScanner MyParser)

           include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR})
           add_executable(Foo
              Foo.cc
              ${BISON_MyParser_OUTPUTS}
              ${FLEX_MyScanner_OUTPUTS}
           )
           target_link_libraries(Foo ${FLEX_LIBRARIES})
          ====================================================================

   <b>FindFLTK</b>
       Find the Fast Light Toolkit (FLTK) library

   <b>Input</b> <b>Variables</b>
       By  default  this  module  will  search for all of the FLTK components and add them to the <b>FLTK_LIBRARIES</b>
       variable.  You can limit the components which get placed in <b>FLTK_LIBRARIES</b> by defining one or more of the
       following three options:

       <b>FLTK_SKIP_OPENGL</b>
              Set to true to disable searching for the FLTK GL library

       <b>FLTK_SKIP_FORMS</b>
              Set to true to disable searching for the FLTK Forms library

       Added  in  version  3.5: When <b>GTK2_USE_IMPORTED_TARGETS</b> is set to <b>TRUE</b>, <b>GTK2_LIBRARIES</b> will list imported
       targets instead of library paths.

   <b>Input</b> <b>Variables</b>
       Optional variables you can define prior to calling this module:

       <b>GTK2_DEBUG</b>
              Enables verbose debugging of the module

       <b>GTK2_ADDITIONAL_SUFFIXES</b>
              Allows defining additional directories to search for include files

   <b>Example</b> <b>Usage</b>
       Call <u>find_package()</u> once.  Here are some examples to pick from:

       Require GTK 2.6 or later:

          find_package(GTK2 2.6 REQUIRED gtk)

       Require GTK 2.10 or later and Glade:

          find_package(GTK2 2.10 REQUIRED gtk glade)

       Search for GTK/GTKMM 2.8 or later:

          find_package(GTK2 2.8 COMPONENTS gtk gtkmm)

       Use the results:

          if(GTK2_FOUND)
            include_directories(${GTK2_INCLUDE_DIRS})
            add_executable(mygui mygui.cc)
            target_link_libraries(mygui ${GTK2_LIBRARIES})
          endif()

   <b>FindHDF5</b>
       Find Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5), a library for reading and writing self describing array data.

       This module invokes the <b>HDF5</b> wrapper compiler that should be installed alongside  <b>HDF5</b>.   Depending  upon
       the  <b>HDF5</b>  Configuration,  the  wrapper  compiler  is called either <b>h5cc</b> or <b>h5pcc</b>.  If this succeeds, the
       module will then call the compiler with the show argument to see what flags are used  when  compiling  an
       <b>HDF5</b> client application.

       The module will optionally accept the <b>COMPONENTS</b> argument.  If no <b>COMPONENTS</b> are specified, then the find
       module  will  default  to  finding only the <b>HDF5</b> C library.  If one or more <b>COMPONENTS</b> are specified, the
       module will attempt to find the language bindings for the specified components.  The valid components are
       <b>C</b>, <b>CXX</b>, <b>Fortran</b>, <b>HL</b>.  <b>HL</b> refers to the "high-level" HDF5 functions for C and Fortran.  If the  <b>COMPONENTS</b>
       argument  is not given, the module will attempt to find only the C bindings.  For example, to use Fortran
       HDF5 and HDF5-HL functions, do: <b>find_package(HDF5</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b> <b>Fortran</b> <b>HL)</b>.

       This module will read the variable <b>HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES</b> to determine whether  or  not  to  prefer  a
       static link to a dynamic link for <b>HDF5</b> and all of it's dependencies.  To use this feature, make sure that
       the <b>HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES</b> variable is set before the call to find_package.

       Added in version 3.10: Support for <b>HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES</b> on Windows.

       Both  the  serial and parallel <b>HDF5</b> wrappers are considered and the first directory to contain either one
       will be used.  In the event that both appear in the same directory the serial version  is  preferentially
       selected. This behavior can be reversed by setting the variable <b>HDF5_PREFER_PARALLEL</b> to <b>TRUE</b>.

       In  addition  to  finding the includes and libraries required to compile an <b>HDF5</b> client application, this
       module also makes an effort to find tools that come with the <b>HDF5</b> distribution that  may  be  useful  for
       regression testing.

          Ice_&lt;C&gt;_FOUND - ON if component was found
          Ice_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARIES - libraries for component

       Note that <b>&lt;C&gt;</b> is the uppercased name of the component.

       This module reads hints about search results from:

          Ice_HOME - the root of the Ice installation

       The environment variable <b>ICE_HOME</b> may also be used; the Ice_HOME variable takes precedence.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          On  Windows,  Ice  3.7.0 and later provide libraries via the NuGet package manager.  Appropriate NuGet
          packages will be searched for using <b>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</b>, or alternatively <b>Ice_HOME</b> may  be  set  to  the
          location of a specific NuGet package to restrict the search.

       The following cache variables may also be set:

          Ice_&lt;P&gt;_EXECUTABLE - the path to executable &lt;P&gt;
          Ice_INCLUDE_DIR - the directory containing the Ice headers
          Ice_SLICE_DIR - the directory containing the Ice slice interface
                          definitions
          Ice_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARY - the library for component &lt;C&gt;

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          In  most  cases  none  of  the  above variables will require setting, unless multiple Ice versions are
          available and a specific version is required.  On Windows, the most recent  version  of  Ice  will  be
          found  through the registry.  On Unix, the programs, headers and libraries will usually be in standard
          locations, but Ice_SLICE_DIRS might not  be  automatically  detected  (commonly  known  locations  are
          searched).   All  the  other  variables  are  defaulted  using Ice_HOME, if set.  It's possible to set
          Ice_HOME and selectively specify alternative  locations  for  the  other  components;  this  might  be
          required for e.g. newer versions of Visual Studio if the heuristics are not sufficient to identify the
          correct programs and libraries for the specific Visual Studio version.

       Other variables one may set to control this module are:

          Ice_DEBUG - Set to ON to enable debug output from FindIce.

   <b>FindIconv</b>
       Added in version 3.11.

       This  module finds the <b>iconv()</b> POSIX.1 functions on the system.  These functions might be provided in the
       regular C library or externally in the form of an additional library.

       The following variables are provided to indicate iconv support:

       <b>Iconv_FOUND</b>
              Variable indicating if the iconv support was found.

       <b>Iconv_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              The directories containing the iconv headers.

       <b>Iconv_LIBRARIES</b>
              The iconv libraries to be linked.

       <b>Iconv_VERSION</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              The version of iconv found (x.y)

       <b>Iconv_VERSION_MAJOR</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              The major version of iconv

       <b>Iconv_VERSION_MINOR</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              The minor version of iconv

       <b>Iconv_IS_BUILT_IN</b>
              A variable indicating whether iconv support is stemming from the C library or not. Even if  the  C
              library  provides  <u>iconv()</u>, the presence of an external <u>libiconv</u> implementation might lead to this
              being false.

       Additionally, the following <u>IMPORTED</u> target is being provided:

       <b>Iconv::Iconv</b>
              Imported target for using iconv.

       The following cache variables may also be set:

       <b>Iconv_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              The directory containing the iconv headers.

       <b>Iconv_LIBRARY</b>
              The iconv library (if not implicitly given in the C library).

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          On POSIX platforms, iconv might be part of the C library and the cache variables <b>Iconv_INCLUDE_DIR</b> and

       caller may set variable <b>JAVA_HOME</b> to specify a Java installation prefix explicitly.

       See also the <u>FindJNI</u> module to find Java Native Interface (JNI).

       Added in version 3.10: Added support for Java 9+ version parsing.

       Specify one or more of the following components as you call this find module. See example below.

          Runtime     = Java Runtime Environment used to execute Java byte-compiled applications
          Development = Development tools (java, javac, javah, jar and javadoc), includes Runtime component
          IdlJ        = Interface Description Language (IDL) to Java compiler
          JarSigner   = Signer and verifier tool for Java Archive (JAR) files

       The minimum required version of Java can be specified using the <u>find_package()</u> syntax, e.g.

          find_package(Java 1.8)

       NOTE:  <b>${Java_VERSION}</b>  and  <b>${Java_VERSION_STRING}</b> are not guaranteed to be identical.  For example some
       java version may return: <b>Java_VERSION_STRING</b> <b>=</b> <b>1.8.0_17</b> and <b>Java_VERSION</b> <b>=</b> <b>1.8.0.17</b>

       another example is the Java OEM, with: <b>Java_VERSION_STRING</b> <b>=</b> <b>1.8.0-oem</b> and <b>Java_VERSION</b> <b>=</b> <b>1.8.0</b>

       For these components the following variables are set:

   <b>FindJNI</b>
       Find Java Native Interface (JNI) headers and libraries.

       JNI enables Java code running in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) on  Android
       to call and be called by native applications and libraries written in other languages such as C and C++.

       This module finds if Java is installed and determines where the include files and libraries are.  It also
       determines  what  the  name  of  the library is.  The caller may set variable <b>JAVA_HOME</b> to specify a Java
       installation prefix explicitly.

       Added in version 3.24: Added imported targets, components <b>AWT</b>, <b>JVM</b>,  and  Android  NDK  support.   If  no
       components  are  specified,  the module defaults to an empty components list while targeting Android, and
       all available components otherwise.

       When using Android NDK, the corresponding package version is reported  and  a  specific  release  can  be
       requested.  At  Android  API  level 31 and above, the additional <b>NativeHelper</b> component can be requested.
       <b>NativeHelper</b> is also exposed as an implicit dependency of the <b>JVM</b> component (only if this does not  cause
       a conflict) which provides a uniform access to JVM functions.

   <b>Imported</b> <b>Targets</b>
       Added in version 3.24.

       <b>JNI::JNI</b>
              Main JNI target, defined only if <b>jni.h</b> was found.

       <b>JNI::JVM</b>
              Java Virtual Machine (JVM) library, defined only if component <b>JVM</b> was found.

       <b>JNI::NativeHelper</b>
              When  targeting  Android  API  level  31  and  above,  the  import  target  will provide access to
              <b>libnativehelper.so</b> that exposes JVM functions such as <b>JNI_CreateJavaVM</b>.

   <b>Result</b> <b>Variables</b>
       This module sets the following result variables:

   <b>FindMatlab</b>
       Finds Matlab or Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR) and provides  Matlab  tools,  libraries  and  compilers  to
       CMake.

       This  package  primary  purpose is to find the libraries associated with Matlab or the MCR in order to be
       able to build Matlab extensions (mex files). It can also be used:

       • to run specific commands in Matlab in case Matlab is available

       • for declaring Matlab unit test

       • to retrieve various information from Matlab (mex extensions, versions and release queries, ...)

       Added in version 3.12: Added Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR) support.

       The module supports the following components:

       • <b>ENG_LIBRARY</b> and <b>MAT_LIBRARY</b>: respectively the <b>ENG</b> and <b>MAT</b> libraries of Matlab

       • <b>MAIN_PROGRAM</b> the Matlab binary program. Note that this component is not available on the  MCR  version,
         and will yield an error if the MCR is found instead of the regular Matlab installation.

       • <b>MEX_COMPILER</b> the MEX compiler.

       • <b>MCC_COMPILER</b> the MCC compiler, included with the Matlab Compiler add-on.

       • <b>SIMULINK</b> the Simulink environment.

       Added in version 3.7: Added the <b>MAT_LIBRARY</b> component.

       Added in version 3.13: Added the <b>ENGINE_LIBRARY</b>, <b>DATAARRAY_LIBRARY</b> and <b>MCC_COMPILER</b> components.

       Changed  in version 3.14: Removed the <b>MX_LIBRARY</b>, <b>ENGINE_LIBRARY</b> and <b>DATAARRAY_LIBRARY</b> components.  These
       libraries are found unconditionally.

       Added in version 3.30: Added support for specifying a version range to <u>find_package()</u> and  added  support
       for specifying <b>REGISTRY_VIEW</b> to <u>find_package()</u>, <u>matlab_extract_all_installed_versions_from_registry()</u> and
       <u>matlab_get_all_valid_matlab_roots_from_registry()</u>.  The default behavior remained unchanged, by using the
       registry view <b>TARGET</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The version given to the <u>find_package()</u> directive is the Matlab <b>version</b>, which should not be  confused
          with   the   Matlab  <u>release</u>  name  (e.g.  <u>R2023b</u>).   The  <u>matlab_get_version_from_release_name()</u>  and
          <u>matlab_get_release_name_from_version()</u> provide a mapping between the release name and the version.

       The variable <u>Matlab_ROOT_DIR</u> may be specified in order to give the path of the  desired  Matlab  version.
       Otherwise, the behavior is platform specific:

       • Windows:   The  installed  versions  of  Matlab/MCR  are  retrieved  from  the  Windows  registry.  The
         <b>REGISTRY_VIEW</b> argument may optionally be specified to manually control whether 32bit or 64bit  versions
         shall be searched for.

       • macOS:  The  installed  versions of Matlab/MCR are given by the MATLAB default installation paths under
         <b>$HOME/Applications</b> and <b>/Applications</b>.  If no such application is found, it falls back to the  one  that
         might be accessible from the <b>PATH</b>.

       • Unix:  The  desired  Matlab should be accessible from the <b>PATH</b>. This does not work for MCR installation
         and <u>Matlab_ROOT_DIR</u> should be specified on this platform.

       Additional information is provided when <u>MATLAB_FIND_DEBUG</u> is set.   When  a  Matlab/MCR  installation  is
       found  automatically and the <b>MATLAB_VERSION</b> is not given, the version is queried from Matlab directly (on
       Windows this may pop up a Matlab window) or from the MCR installation.

       The mapping of the release names and the  version  of  Matlab  is  performed  by  defining  pairs  (name,
       version).   The variable <u>MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS</u> may be provided before the call to the <u>find_package()</u>
       in order to handle additional versions.

       A Matlab scripts can be added to the set of tests  using  the  <u>matlab_add_unit_test()</u>.  By  default,  the

       <u>matlab_get_version_from_release_name()</u>
              returns the version from the Matlab release name

       <u>matlab_get_release_name_from_version()</u>
              returns the release name from the Matlab version

       <u>matlab_add_mex()</u>
              adds a target compiling a MEX file.

       <u>matlab_add_unit_test()</u>
              adds a Matlab unit test file as a test to the project.

       <u>matlab_extract_all_installed_versions_from_registry()</u>
              parses the registry for all Matlab versions. Available on Windows only.  The part of the  registry
              parsed is dependent on the host processor

       <u>matlab_get_all_valid_matlab_roots_from_registry()</u>
              returns  all  the  possible  Matlab  or  MCR paths, according to a previously given list. Only the
              existing/accessible paths are kept. This is mainly useful for the searching  all  possible  Matlab
              installation.

       <u>matlab_get_mex_suffix()</u>
              returns the suffix to be used for the mex files (platform/architecture dependent)

       <u>matlab_get_version_from_matlab_run()</u>
              returns the version of Matlab/MCR, given the full directory of the Matlab/MCR installation path.

   <b>Known</b> <b>issues</b>
       <b>Symbol</b> <b>clash</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>MEX</b> <b>target</b>
              By  default, every symbols inside a MEX file defined with the command <u>matlab_add_mex()</u> have hidden
              visibility, except for the entry point. This is the default behavior of the  MEX  compiler,  which
              lowers  the  risk of symbol collision between the libraries shipped with Matlab, and the libraries
              to which the MEX file is linking to. This is also the default on Windows platforms.

              However, this is not sufficient in certain case, where for  instance  your  MEX  file  is  linking
              against  libraries  that  are  already  loaded  by  Matlab, even if those libraries have different
              SONAMES.  A possible solution is to hide the symbols of the libraries to which the MEX  target  is
              linking   to.   This   can   be   achieved   in   GNU   GCC   compilers  with  the  linker  option
              <b>-Wl,--exclude-libs,ALL</b>.

       <b>Tests</b> <b>using</b> <b>GPU</b> <b>resources</b>
              in case your MEX file is using the GPU and in order to be able to run unit tests on this MEX file,
              the GPU resources should be properly released by Matlab. A possible solution  is  to  make  Matlab
              aware  of the use of the GPU resources in the session, which can be performed by a command such as
              <b>D</b> <b>=</b> <b>gpuDevice()</b> at the beginning of the test script (or via a fixture).

   <b>Reference</b>
       <b>Matlab_ROOT_DIR</b>
              The root folder of the Matlab installation. If set before the call to <u>find_package()</u>,  the  module
              will  look for the components in that path. If not set, then an automatic search of Matlab will be
              performed. If set, it should point to a valid version of Matlab.

       <b>MATLAB_FIND_DEBUG</b>
              If set, the lookup of Matlab and  the  intermediate  configuration  steps  are  outputted  to  the
              console.

       <b>MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS</b>
              If  set, specifies additional versions of Matlab that may be looked for.  The variable should be a
              list of strings, organized by pairs of release name and versions, such as follows:

                 set(MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
                     "release_name1=corresponding_version1"
                     "release_name2=corresponding_version2"
                     ...
                     )

              Example:

                 set(MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
                     "R2013b=8.2"
                     "R2013a=8.1"
                     "R2012b=8.0")

              The order of entries in this list matters when several  versions  of  Matlab  are  installed.  The
              priority is set according to the ordering in this list.

                     if  given, the file <b>file.txt</b> will be considered as being the documentation file for the MEX
                     file. This file is copied into the same folder without any processing, with the  same  name
                     as  the  final  mex file, and with extension <u>.m</u>. In that case, typing <b>help</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> in Matlab
                     prints the documentation contained in this file.

              <b>R2017b</b> <b>or</b> <b>R2018a</b>
                     Added in version 3.14.

                     May be given to specify the version of the C API to use: <b>R2017b</b> specifies  the  traditional
                     (separate  complex)  C API, and corresponds to the <b>-R2017b</b> flag for the <u>mex</u> command. <b>R2018a</b>
                     specifies the new interleaved complex C API, and corresponds to the <b>-R2018a</b>  flag  for  the
                     <u>mex</u> command. Ignored if MATLAB version prior to R2018a. Defaults to <b>R2017b</b>.

              <b>MODULE</b> <b>or</b> <b>SHARED</b>
                     Added in version 3.7.

                     May be given to specify the type of library to be created.

              <b>EXECUTABLE</b>
                     Added in version 3.7.

                     May  be given to create an executable instead of a library. If no type is given explicitly,
                     the type is <b>SHARED</b>.

              <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b>
                     This option has the same meaning as for <u>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</u> and is forwarded to  <u>add_library()</u>
                     or <u>add_executable()</u> commands.

              <b>NO_IMPLICIT_LINK_TO_MATLAB_LIBRARIES</b>
                     Added in version 3.24.

                     This  option permits to disable the automatic linking of MATLAB libraries, so that only the
                     libraries that are actually required can be linked via the <b>LINK_TO</b> option.

              The documentation file is not processed and should be in the following format:

                 % This is the documentation
                 function ret = mex_target_output_name(input1)

   <b>FindMFC</b>

   <b>FindMPI</b>
       Find a Message Passing Interface (MPI) implementation.

       The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is  a  library  used  to  write  high-performance  distributed-memory
       parallel  applications,  and is typically deployed on a cluster.  MPI is a standard interface (defined by
       the MPI forum) for which many implementations are available.

       Added in version 3.10: Major overhaul of the module: many new variables, per-language components, support
       for a wider variety of runtimes.

   <b>Variables</b> <b>for</b> <b>using</b> <b>MPI</b>
       The module exposes the components <b>C</b>, <b>CXX</b>, <b>MPICXX</b> and <b>Fortran</b>.  Each of these  controls  the  various  MPI
       languages to search for.  The difference between <b>CXX</b> and <b>MPICXX</b> is that <b>CXX</b> refers to the MPI C API being
       usable from C++, whereas <b>MPICXX</b> refers to the MPI-2 C++ API that was removed again in MPI-3.

       Depending on the enabled components the following variables will be set:

       <b>MPI_FOUND</b>
              Variable  indicating  that  MPI  settings  for  all  requested  languages  have been found.  If no
              components are specified, this is true if MPI settings for all enabled  languages  were  detected.
              Note that the <b>MPICXX</b> component does not affect this variable.

       <b>MPI_VERSION</b>
              Minimal  version  of  MPI  detected  among the requested languages, or all enabled languages if no
              components were specified.

       This module will set the following variables per language in your project, where <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> is one of C, CXX,
       or Fortran:

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_FOUND</b>
              Variable indicating the MPI settings for <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> were found  and  that  simple  MPI  test  programs
              compile with the provided settings.

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER</b>
              MPI compiler for <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> if such a program exists.

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILE_OPTIONS</b>
              Compilation options for MPI programs in <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>, given as a <u>;-list</u>.

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b>
              Compilation definitions for MPI programs in <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>, given as a <u>;-list</u>.

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              Include path(s) for MPI header.

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LINK_FLAGS</b>
              Linker flags for MPI programs.

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARIES</b>
              All libraries to link MPI programs against.

       Added in version 3.9: Additionally, the following <u>IMPORTED</u> targets are defined:

       <b>MPI::MPI_&lt;lang&gt;</b>
              Target for using MPI from <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>.

       The following variables indicating which bindings are present will be defined:

       <b>MPI_MPICXX_FOUND</b>
              Variable  indicating whether the MPI-2 C++ bindings are present (introduced in MPI-2, removed with
              MPI-3).

       <b>MPI_Fortran_HAVE_F77_HEADER</b>
              True if the Fortran 77 header <b>mpif.h</b> is available.

       <b>MPI_Fortran_HAVE_F90_MODULE</b>
              True if the Fortran 90 module <b>mpi</b> can be used for accessing MPI (MPI-2 and higher only).

       <b>MPI_Fortran_HAVE_F08_MODULE</b>
              True if the Fortran 2008 <b>mpi_f08</b> is available to MPI programs (MPI-3 and higher only).

       If possible, the MPI version will be determined by this module. The facilities to detect the MPI  version
       were introduced with MPI-1.2, and therefore cannot be found for older MPI versions.

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR</b>
              Major version of MPI implemented for <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> by the MPI distribution.

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_VERSION_MINOR</b>
              Minor version of MPI implemented for <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> by the MPI distribution.

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_VERSION</b>
              MPI version implemented for <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> by the MPI distribution.

       Note  that there's no variable for the C bindings being accessible through <b>mpi.h</b>, since the MPI standards
       always have required this binding to work in both C and C++ code.

       For running MPI programs, the module sets the following variables

       <b>MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE</b>
              Executable for running MPI programs, if such exists.

       <b>MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG</b>
              Flag to pass to <b>mpiexec</b> before giving it the number of processors to run on.

       <b>MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS</b>
              Number of MPI processors to utilize. Defaults to the number of processors  detected  on  the  host
              system.

       <b>MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS</b>
              Flags to pass to <b>mpiexec</b> directly before the executable to run.

       <b>MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS</b>
              Flags to pass to <b>mpiexec</b> after other flags.

   <b>Variables</b> <b>for</b> <b>locating</b> <b>MPI</b>
       This module performs a four step search for an MPI implementation:

       1. Search for <b>MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE</b> and, if found, use its base directory.

       2. Check if the compiler has MPI support built-in. This is the case if the user passed a compiler wrapper
          as <b>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER</b> or if they use Cray system compiler wrappers.

       3. Attempt to find an MPI compiler wrapper and determine the compiler information from it.

       4. Try  to find an MPI implementation that does not ship such a wrapper by guessing settings.  Currently,
          only Microsoft MPI and MPICH2 on Windows are supported.

       For controlling the <b>MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE</b> step, the following variables may be set:

       <b>MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE</b>
              Manually specify the location of <b>mpiexec</b>.

       <b>MPI_HOME</b>
              Specify the base directory of the MPI installation.

       <b>ENV{MPI_HOME}</b>
              Environment variable to specify the base directory of the MPI installation.

       <b>ENV{I_MPI_ROOT}</b>
              Environment variable to specify the base directory of the MPI installation.

       For controlling the compiler wrapper step, the following variables may be set:

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER</b>
              Search for the specified compiler wrapper and use it.

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER_FLAGS</b>
              Flags to pass to the MPI compiler wrapper during interrogation.  Some  compiler  wrappers  support
              linking  debug  or tracing libraries if a specific flag is passed and this variable may be used to
              obtain them.

       <b>MPI_COMPILER_FLAGS</b>
              Used to initialize <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER_FLAGS</b> if no language specific flag has been  given.   Empty
              by default.

       <b>MPI_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX</b>
              A  suffix  which is appended to all names that are being looked for. For instance you may set this
              to <b>.mpich</b> or <b>.openmpi</b> to prefer the one or the other on Debian and its derivatives.

       In order to control the guessing step, the following variable may be set:

       <b>MPI_GUESS_LIBRARY_NAME</b>
              Valid values are <b>MSMPI</b> and <b>MPICH2</b>. If set, only the  given  library  will  be  searched  for.   By
              default,   <b>MSMPI</b>   will  be  preferred  over  <b>MPICH2</b>  if  both  are  available.   This  also  sets
              <b>MPI_SKIP_COMPILER_WRAPPER</b> to <b>true</b>, which may be overridden.

       Each of the search steps may be skipped with the following control variables:

       <b>MPI_ASSUME_NO_BUILTIN_MPI</b>
              If true, the module assumes that the compiler itself does not provide an  MPI  implementation  and
              skips to step 2.

       <b>MPI_SKIP_COMPILER_WRAPPER</b>
              If true, no compiler wrapper will be searched for.

       <b>MPI_SKIP_GUESSING</b>
              If true, the guessing step will be skipped.

       Additionally, the following control variable is available to change search behavior:

       <b>MPI_CXX_SKIP_MPICXX</b>
              Add  some  definitions  that  will disable the MPI-2 C++ bindings.  Currently supported are MPICH,
              Open MPI, Platform MPI and derivatives thereof, for example MVAPICH or Intel MPI.

       If the find procedure fails for a variable <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_WORKS</b>, then the settings detected by or  passed  to
       the module did not work and even a simple MPI test program failed to compile.

       If  all  of these parameters were not sufficient to find the right MPI implementation, a user may disable
       the entire autodetection process by specifying both a list of libraries  in  <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARIES</b>  and  a
       list  of  include  directories  in  <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>.  Any other variable may be set in
       addition to these two. The module will then validate the MPI settings  and  store  the  settings  in  the
       cache.

   <b>Cache</b> <b>variables</b> <b>for</b> <b>MPI</b>
       The variable <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_INCLUDE_DIRS</b> will be assembled from the following variables.  For C and CXX:

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_HEADER_DIR</b>
              Location of the <b>mpi.h</b> header on disk.

       For Fortran:

       <b>MPI_Fortran_F77_HEADER_DIR</b>
              Location of the Fortran 77 header <b>mpif.h</b>, if it exists.

       <b>MPI_Fortran_MODULE_DIR</b>
              Location of the <b>mpi</b> or <b>mpi_f08</b> modules, if available.

       For all languages the following variables are additionally considered:

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              A <u>;-list</u> of paths needed in addition to the normal include directories.

       <b>MPI_&lt;include_name&gt;_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              Path variables for include folders referred to by <b>&lt;include_name&gt;</b>.

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_VARS</b>
              A <u>;-list</u> of <b>&lt;include_name&gt;</b> that will be added to the include locations of <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>.

       The variable <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARIES</b> will be assembled from the following variables:

       <b>MPI_&lt;lib_name&gt;_LIBRARY</b>
              The location of a library called <b>&lt;lib_name&gt;</b> for use with MPI.

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LIB_NAMES</b>
              A <u>;-list</u> of <b>&lt;lib_name&gt;</b> that will be added to the include locations of <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>.

   <b>Usage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mpiexec</b>
       When  using  <b>MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE</b>  to  execute  MPI  applications,  you  should  typically  use  all of the
       <b>MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE</b> flags as follows:

          ${MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE} ${MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG} ${MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS}
            ${MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS} EXECUTABLE ${MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS} ARGS

       where <b>EXECUTABLE</b> is the MPI program, and <b>ARGS</b> are the arguments to pass to the MPI program.

   <b>Advanced</b> <b>variables</b> <b>for</b> <b>using</b> <b>MPI</b>
       The module can perform some advanced feature detections upon explicit request.

       <b>Important</b> <b>notice:</b> The following checks cannot  be  performed  without  <u>executing</u>  an  MPI  test  program.
       Consider  the  special  considerations for the behavior of <u>try_run()</u> during cross compilation.  Moreover,
       running an MPI program can cause additional issues, like a firewall notification on  some  systems.   You
       should only enable these detections if you absolutely need the information.

       If the following variables are set to true, the respective search will be performed:

       <b>MPI_DETERMINE_Fortran_CAPABILITIES</b>
              Determine  for  all  available  Fortran  bindings  what  the values of <b>MPI_SUBARRAYS_SUPPORTED</b> and
              <b>MPI_ASYNC_PROTECTS_NONBLOCKING</b>     are     and     make     their     values     available      as
              <b>MPI_Fortran_&lt;binding&gt;_SUBARRAYS</b>  and  <b>MPI_Fortran_&lt;binding&gt;_ASYNCPROT</b>,  where  <b>&lt;binding&gt;</b> is one of
              <b>F77_HEADER</b>, <b>F90_MODULE</b> and <b>F08_MODULE</b>.

       <b>MPI_DETERMINE_LIBRARY_VERSION</b>
              For  each  language,  find  the  output  of  <b>MPI_Get_library_version</b>  and  make  it  available  as
              <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARY_VERSION_STRING</b>.   This  information is usually tied to the runtime component of
              an MPI implementation and might differ depending  on  <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>.   Note  that  the  return  value  is
              entirely implementation defined. This information might be used to identify the MPI vendor and for
              example pick the correct one of multiple third party binaries that matches the MPI vendor.

   <b>Backward</b> <b>Compatibility</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.10.

       For backward compatibility with older versions of FindMPI, these variables are set:

          MPI_COMPILER        MPI_LIBRARY        MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY
          MPI_COMPILE_FLAGS   MPI_INCLUDE_PATH   MPI_LINK_FLAGS
          MPI_LIBRARIES

       In  new  projects,  please use the <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_XXX</b> equivalents.  Additionally, the following variables are
       deprecated:

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILE_FLAGS</b>
              Use <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILE_OPTIONS</b> and <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS</b> instead.

       <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_INCLUDE_PATH</b>
              For    consumption    use    <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>    and    for    specifying    folders    use
              <b>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_DIRS</b> instead.

       <b>MPIEXEC</b>
              Use <b>MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE</b> instead.

   <b>FindMsys</b>
       Added in version 3.21.

       Find MSYS, a POSIX-compatible environment that runs natively on Microsoft Windows

   <b>FindODBC</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       Find an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) include directory and library.

       On  Windows,  when  building  with Visual Studio, this module assumes the ODBC library is provided by the
       available Windows SDK.

       On Unix, this module allows to search for ODBC library provided by unixODBC or iODBC  implementations  of
       ODBC API.  This module reads hint about location of the config program:

       <b>ODBC_CONFIG</b>
              Location of odbc_config or iodbc-config program

       Otherwise,  this  module  tries  to find the config program, first from unixODBC, then from iODBC.  If no
       config program found, this module searches for ODBC header and library in list of known locations.

   <b>Imported</b> <b>targets</b>
       This module defines the following <u>IMPORTED</u> targets:

       <b>ODBC::ODBC</b>
              Imported target for using the ODBC library, if found.

   <b>Result</b> <b>variables</b>
       <b>ODBC_FOUND</b>
              Set to true if ODBC library found, otherwise false or undefined.

       <b>ODBC_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              Paths to include directories listed in one variable for use by  ODBC  client.   May  be  empty  on
              Windows,  where  the  include  directory  corresponding  to  the  expected  Windows SDK is already
              available in the compilation environment.

       <b>ODBC_LIBRARIES</b>
              Paths to libraries to linked against to use ODBC.  May just a library name on Windows,  where  the
              library  directory  corresponding  to  the  expected  Windows  SDK  is  already  available  in the
              compilation environment.

       <b>ODBC_CONFIG</b>
              Path to unixODBC or iODBC config program, if found or specified.

   <b>Cache</b> <b>variables</b>
       For users who wish to edit and control  the  module  behavior,  this  module  reads  hints  about  search
       locations from the following variables:

       <b>ODBC_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              Path to ODBC include directory with <b>sql.h</b> header.

       <b>ODBC_LIBRARY</b>
              Path to ODBC library to be linked.

       These variables should not be used directly by project code.

   <b>Limitations</b>
       On  Windows,  this  module  does  not search for iODBC.  On Unix, there is no way to prefer unixODBC over
       iODBC, or vice versa, other than providing the config  program  location  using  the  <b>ODBC_CONFIG</b>.   This
       module does not allow to search for a specific ODBC driver.

   <b>FindOpenACC</b>
       Added in version 3.10.

       Detect OpenACC support by the compiler.

       This  module  can be used to detect OpenACC support in a compiler.  If the compiler supports OpenACC, the
       flags required to compile with OpenACC support are returned in variables  for  the  different  languages.
       Currently, only NVHPC, PGI, GNU and Cray compilers are supported.

   <b>Imported</b> <b>Targets</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       The module provides <u>IMPORTED</u> targets:

       <b>OpenACC::OpenACC_&lt;lang&gt;</b>
              Target for using OpenACC from <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>.

   <b>Variables</b>
       The module defines the following variables:

       <b>OpenACC_FOUND</b>
              Added in version 3.25.

              Variable indicating that OpenACC flags for at least one languages have been found.

       This module will set the following variables per language in your project, where <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> is one of C, CXX,
       or Fortran:

       <b>OpenACC_&lt;lang&gt;_FOUND</b>
              Variable indicating if OpenACC support for <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> was detected.

       <b>OpenACC_&lt;lang&gt;_FLAGS</b>
              OpenACC compiler flags for <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>, separated by spaces.

       <b>OpenACC_&lt;lang&gt;_OPTIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.16.

              OpenACC  compiler  flags  for <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>, as a list. Suitable for usage with target_compile_options or
              target_link_options.

       The module will also try to provide the OpenACC version variables:

       <b>OpenACC_&lt;lang&gt;_SPEC_DATE</b>
              Date of the OpenACC specification implemented by the <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> compiler.

       <b>OpenACC_&lt;lang&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR</b>
              Major version of OpenACC implemented by the <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> compiler.

       <b>OpenACC_&lt;lang&gt;_VERSION_MINOR</b>
              Minor version of OpenACC implemented by the <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> compiler.

       <b>OpenACC_&lt;lang&gt;_VERSION</b>
              OpenACC version implemented by the <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> compiler.

       The specification date is formatted as given in the OpenACC standard: <b>yyyymm</b> where <b>yyyy</b> and <b>mm</b> represents
       the year and month of the OpenACC specification implemented by the <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> compiler.

   <b>Input</b> <b>Variables</b>
       <b>OpenACC_ACCEL_TARGET=&lt;target&gt;</b> If set, will the correct target accelerator flag set to the  &lt;target&gt;  will
       be returned with OpenACC_&lt;lang&gt;_FLAGS.

   <b>FindOpenAL</b>
       Finds Open Audio Library (OpenAL).

       Projects  using  this  module  should use <b>#include</b> <b>"al.h"</b> to include the OpenAL header file, <b>not</b> <b>#include</b>
       <b>&lt;AL/al.h&gt;</b>.  The reason for this is that the latter is not entirely portable.  Windows/Creative Labs  does
       not by default put their headers in <b>AL/</b> and macOS uses the convention <b>&lt;OpenAL/al.h&gt;</b>.

   <b>Hints</b>
       Environment variable <b>$OPENALDIR</b> can be used to set the prefix of OpenAL installation to be found.

       By  default  on  macOS,  system  framework  is  search  first.  In other words, OpenAL is searched in the
       following order:

       1. System  framework:  <b>/System/Library/Frameworks</b>,  whose  priority  can  be  changed  via  setting   the
          <u>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</u> variable.

       2. Environment variable <b>$OPENALDIR</b>.

       3. System paths.

       4. User-compiled framework: <b><a href="file:~/Library/Frameworks">~/Library/Frameworks</a></b>.

       5. Manually compiled framework: <b>/Library/Frameworks</b>.

       6. Add-on package: <b><a href="file:/opt">/opt</a></b>.

       This module defines the <u>IMPORTED</u> targets:

       <b>OpenGL::GL</b>
              Defined to the platform-specific OpenGL libraries if the system has OpenGL.

       <b>OpenGL::GLU</b>
              Defined if the system has OpenGL Utility Library (GLU).

       Added in version 3.10: Additionally, the following GLVND-specific library targets are defined:

       <b>OpenGL::OpenGL</b>
              Defined to libOpenGL if the system is GLVND-based.

       <b>OPENGL_GLU_FOUND</b>
              True, if the system has GLU.

       <b>OpenGL_OpenGL_FOUND</b>
              True, if the system has an OpenGL library.

       <b>OPENGL_LIBRARIES</b>
              Paths  to  the  OpenGL  library,  windowing  system  libraries, and GLU libraries.  On Linux, this
              assumes GLX and is never correct for  EGL-based  targets.   Clients  are  encouraged  to  use  the
              <b>OpenGL::*</b> import targets instead.

       <b>OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              Added in version 3.29.

              Paths to the OpenGL include directories.

       The following cache variables may also be set:

       <b>OPENGL_egl_LIBRARY</b>
              Path to the EGL library.

       <b>OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY</b>
              Path to the GLU library.

       <b>OPENGL_glx_LIBRARY</b>
              Path to the GLVND 'GLX' library.

       <b>OPENGL_opengl_LIBRARY</b>
              Path to the GLVND 'OpenGL' library

       <b>OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY</b>
              Path to the OpenGL library.  New code should prefer the <b>OpenGL::*</b> import targets.

       <b>OPENGL_gles2_LIBRARY</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              Path to the OpenGL GLES2 library.

       <b>OPENGL_gles3_LIBRARY</b>
              Added in version 3.27.

              Path to the OpenGL GLES3 library.

       <b>OPENGL_GLU_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              Added in version 3.29.

              Path to the OpenGL GLU include directory.

       Added in version 3.10: Variables for GLVND-specific libraries <b>OpenGL</b>, <b>EGL</b> and <b>GLX</b>.

   <b>Linux-specific</b>
       Some  Linux systems utilize GLVND as a new ABI for OpenGL.  GLVND separates context libraries from OpenGL
       itself; OpenGL lives in "libOpenGL", and  contexts  are  defined  in  "libGLX"  or  "libEGL".   GLVND  is
       currently  the  only  way  to  get  OpenGL  3+ functionality via EGL in a manner portable across vendors.
       Projects may use GLVND explicitly with target <b>OpenGL::OpenGL</b> and either <b>OpenGL::GLX</b> or <b>OpenGL::EGL</b>.

       Projects may use the <b>OpenGL::GL</b> target (or <b>OPENGL_LIBRARIES</b> variable) to use legacy GL interfaces.  These
       will use the legacy GL library located by <b>OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY</b>, if available.  If <b>OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY</b> is empty
       or not found and GLVND is available, the <b>OpenGL::GL</b> target will use GLVND <b>OpenGL::OpenGL</b> and  <b>OpenGL::GLX</b>
       (and  the <b>OPENGL_LIBRARIES</b> variable will use the corresponding libraries).  Thus, for non-EGL-based Linux
       targets, the <b>OpenGL::GL</b> target is most portable.

       A <b>OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE</b> variable may be set to specify the preferred way to provide legacy  GL  interfaces
       in case multiple choices are available.  The value may be one of:

       <b>GLVND</b>  If  the  GLVND OpenGL and GLX libraries are available, prefer them.  This forces <b>OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY</b>
              to be empty.

              Changed in version 3.11: This is the  default,  unless  policy  <u>CMP0072</u>  is  set  to  <b>OLD</b>  and  no
              components are requested (since components correspond to GLVND libraries).

       <b>LEGACY</b> Prefer to use the legacy libGL library, if available.

       For  EGL  targets  the  client  must  rely on GLVND support on the user's system.  Linking should use the
       <b>OpenGL::OpenGL</b> <b>OpenGL::EGL</b> targets.   Using  GLES*  libraries  is  theoretically  possible  in  place  of
       <b>OpenGL::OpenGL</b>, but this module does not currently support that; contributions welcome.

       <b>OPENGL_egl_LIBRARY</b> and <b>OPENGL_EGL_INCLUDE_DIRS</b> are defined in the case of GLVND.  For non-GLVND Linux and
       other systems these are left undefined.

   <b>macOS-Specific</b>
       On  macOS  this  module  defaults  to using the macOS-native framework version of OpenGL.  To use the X11
       version of OpenGL on macOS, one can disable searching of frameworks.  For example:

          find_package(X11)
          if(APPLE AND X11_FOUND)
            set(CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK NEVER)
            find_package(OpenGL)
            unset(CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK)
          else()
            find_package(OpenGL)
          endif()

       An end user building this project may  need  to  point  CMake  at  their  X11  installation,  e.g.,  with
       <b>-DOpenGL_ROOT=/opt/X11</b>.

   <b>FindOpenMP</b>
       Finds Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) support.

       This  module  can  be  used to detect OpenMP support in a compiler.  If the compiler supports OpenMP, the
       flags required to compile with OpenMP support are returned in variables for the different languages.  The
       variables may be empty if the compiler does not need a special flag to support OpenMP.

       Added in version 3.5: Clang support.

   <b>Input</b> <b>Variables</b>
       The following variables may be set to influence this module's behavior:

       <b>OpenMP_RUNTIME_MSVC</b>
              Added in version 3.30.

              Specify the <u>OpenMP</u> <u>Runtime</u> when compiling with MSVC.   If  set  to  a  non-empty  value,  such  as
              <b>experimental</b> or <b>llvm</b>, it will be passed as the value of the <b>-openmp:</b> flag.

   <b>Result</b> <b>Variables</b>
       Added in version 3.10: The module exposes the components <b>C</b>, <b>CXX</b>, and <b>Fortran</b>.  Each of these controls the
       various languages to search OpenMP support for.

       Added  in version 3.31: The <b>CUDA</b> language component is supported when using a CUDA compiler that supports
       OpenMP on the host.

       Depending on the enabled components the following variables will be set:

       <b>OpenMP_FOUND</b>
              Variable indicating that OpenMP flags  for  all  requested  languages  have  been  found.   If  no
              components are specified, this is true if OpenMP settings for all enabled languages were detected.

       <b>OpenMP_VERSION</b>
              Minimal  version  of  the  OpenMP  standard detected among the requested languages, or all enabled
              languages if no components were specified.

       This module will set the following variables per language in your project, where <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> is one of C, CXX,
       CUDA, or Fortran:

       <b>OpenMP_&lt;lang&gt;_FOUND</b>
              Variable indicating if OpenMP support for <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> was detected.

       <b>OpenMP_&lt;lang&gt;_FLAGS</b>
              OpenMP compiler flags for <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>, separated by spaces.

       <b>OpenMP_&lt;lang&gt;_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              Directories that must be added to the header search path for <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> when using OpenMP.

       For linking with OpenMP code written in <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>, the following variables are provided:

       <b>OpenMP_&lt;lang&gt;_LIB_NAMES</b>
              <u>;-list</u> of libraries for OpenMP programs for <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>.

       <b>OpenMP_&lt;libname&gt;_LIBRARY</b>
              Location of the individual libraries needed for OpenMP support in <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>.

       <b>OpenMP_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARIES</b>
              A list of libraries needed to link with OpenMP code written in <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>.

       Additionally, the module provides <u>IMPORTED</u> targets:

       <b>OpenMP::OpenMP_&lt;lang&gt;</b>
              Target for using OpenMP from <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>.

       Specifically for Fortran, the module sets the following variables:

       <b>OpenMP_Fortran_HAVE_OMPLIB_HEADER</b>
              Boolean indicating if OpenMP is accessible through <b>omp_lib.h</b>.

       <b>OpenMP_Fortran_HAVE_OMPLIB_MODULE</b>
              Boolean indicating if OpenMP is accessible through the <b>omp_lib</b> Fortran module.

       The module will also try to provide the OpenMP version variables:

       <b>OpenMP_&lt;lang&gt;_SPEC_DATE</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              Date of the OpenMP specification implemented by the <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> compiler.

       <b>OpenMP_&lt;lang&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR</b>
              Major version of OpenMP implemented by the <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> compiler.

       <b>OpenMP_&lt;lang&gt;_VERSION_MINOR</b>
              Minor version of OpenMP implemented by the <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> compiler.

       <b>OpenMP_&lt;lang&gt;_VERSION</b>
              OpenMP version implemented by the <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> compiler.

       The specification date is formatted as given in the OpenMP standard: <b>yyyymm</b> where <b>yyyy</b> and <b>mm</b>  represents
       the year and month of the OpenMP specification implemented by the <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b> compiler.

       For  some compilers, it may be necessary to add a header search path to find the relevant OpenMP headers.
       This location may be language-specific.  Where this is  needed,  the  module  may  attempt  to  find  the
       location,  but it can be provided directly by setting the <b>OpenMP_&lt;lang&gt;_INCLUDE_DIR</b> cache variable.  Note
       that  this  variable  is  an  _input_  control  to   the   module.    Project   code   should   use   the
       <b>OpenMP_&lt;lang&gt;_INCLUDE_DIRS</b> _output_ variable if it needs to know what include directories are needed.

   <b>FindOpenSceneGraph</b>
       Find OpenSceneGraph (3D graphics application programming interface)

       This  module  searches for the OpenSceneGraph core "osg" library as well as <u>FindOpenThreads</u>, and whatever
       additional <b>COMPONENTS</b> (nodekits) that you specify.

          See <a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org">http://www.openscenegraph.org</a>

       NOTE:  To   use   this   module   effectively   you   must   either   require   <b>CMake</b>   <b>&gt;=</b>   <b>2.6.3</b>   with
       <u>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION</u>  <u>2.6.3)</u>  or download and place <u>FindOpenThreads</u>, <u>Findosg</u> functions, <u>Findosg</u>
       and <b>Find&lt;etc&gt;.cmake</b> files into your <u>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</u>.

                                                         ----

       This module accepts the following variables (note mixed case)

          OpenSceneGraph_MARK_AS_ADVANCED - Mark cache variables as advanced
                                            automatically

       The following environment variables are also respected for finding the OSG and it's  various  components.
       <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u> can also be used for this (see <u>find_library()</u> CMake documentation).

       <b>&lt;MODULE&gt;_DIR</b>
              (where <b>MODULE</b> is of the form "OSGVOLUME" and there is a <u>FindosgVolume</u>.cmake` file)

       <b>OSG_DIR</b>

       <b>OSGDIR</b>

       <b>OSG_ROOT</b>

       [CMake  2.8.10]:  The  CMake  variable <b>OSG_DIR</b> can now be used as well to influence detection, instead of
       needing to specify an environment variable.

       This module defines the following output variables:

          OPENSCENEGRAPH_FOUND - Was the OSG and all of the specified components found?

          OPENSCENEGRAPH_VERSION - The version of the OSG which was found

          OPENSCENEGRAPH_INCLUDE_DIRS - Where to find the headers

          OPENSCENEGRAPH_LIBRARIES - The OSG libraries

       ================================== Example Usage:

          find_package(OpenSceneGraph 2.0.0 REQUIRED osgDB osgUtil)
              # libOpenThreads &amp; libosg automatically searched
          include_directories(${OPENSCENEGRAPH_INCLUDE_DIRS})

       <b>OpenSP_MULTI_BYTE</b>
              True  if  <b>SP_MULTI_BYTE</b>  was found to be defined in OpenSP's <b>config.h</b> header file, which indicates
              that the <b>OpenSP</b> library was compiled with support for multi-byte characters. The consuming  target
              needs  to  define  the  <b>SP_MULTI_BYTE</b>  to match this value in order to avoid issues with character
              decoding.

   <b>IMPORTED</b> <b>Targets</b>
       This module defines the <u>IMPORTED</u> target <b>OpenSP::OpenSP</b>, if OpenSP has been found.

   <b>Cache</b> <b>variables</b>
       The following cache variables may also be set:

       <b>OpenSP_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              the OpenSP include directory

       <b>OpenSP_LIBRARY</b>
              the absolute path of the osp library

   <b>FindOpenSSL</b>
       Find the OpenSSL encryption library.

       This module finds an installed OpenSSL library and determines its version.

       Added in version 3.19: When a version is requested, it can be specified as a simple value or as a  range.
       For a detailed description of version range usage and capabilities, refer to the <u>find_package()</u> command.

       Added in version 3.18: Support for OpenSSL 3.0.

   <b>Optional</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       This  module  supports two optional COMPONENTS: <b>Crypto</b> and <b>SSL</b>.  Both components have associated imported
       targets, as described below.

   <b>Imported</b> <b>Targets</b>
       Added in version 3.4.

       This module defines the following <u>IMPORTED</u> targets:

       <b>OpenSSL::SSL</b>
              The OpenSSL <b>ssl</b> library, if found.

       <b>OpenSSL::Crypto</b>
              The OpenSSL <b>crypto</b> library, if found.

       <b>OpenSSL::applink</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              The OpenSSL <b>applink</b> components that might be need to be compiled into projects  under  MSVC.  This
              target  is  available only if found OpenSSL version is not less than 0.9.8. By linking this target
              the above OpenSSL  targets  can  be  linked  even  if  the  project  has  different  MSVC  runtime
              configurations  with  the above OpenSSL targets. This target has no effect on platforms other than
              MSVC.

       NOTE: Due to how <b>INTERFACE_SOURCES</b> are consumed by the consuming target, unless you certainly  know  what
       you  are  doing,  it is always preferred to link <b>OpenSSL::applink</b> target as <b>PRIVATE</b> and to make sure that
       this target is linked at most once for the whole dependency graph of any library or executable:

          target_link_libraries(myTarget PRIVATE OpenSSL::applink)

       Otherwise you would probably encounter unexpected random problems when building and linking, as both  the
       ISO C and the ISO C++ standard claims almost nothing about what a link process should be.

   <b>Result</b> <b>Variables</b>
       This module will set the following variables in your project:

       <b>OPENSSL_FOUND</b>
              System  has  the  OpenSSL  library.  If  no  components  are requested it only requires the crypto
              library.

       <b>OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              The OpenSSL include directory.

       <b>OPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARY</b>
              The OpenSSL crypto library.

       <b>OPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARIES</b>
              The OpenSSL crypto library and its dependencies.

       <b>OPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARY</b>
              The OpenSSL SSL library.

       <b>OPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARIES</b>
              The OpenSSL SSL library and its dependencies.

       <b>OPENSSL_LIBRARIES</b>
              All OpenSSL libraries and their dependencies.

       <b>OPENSSL_VERSION</b>
              This is set to <b>$major.$minor.$revision$patch</b> (e.g. <b>0.9.8s</b>).

       <b>OPENSSL_APPLINK_SOURCE</b>
              The sources in the target <b>OpenSSL::applink</b> that is mentioned above. This variable shall always  be
              undefined if found openssl version is less than 0.9.8 or if platform is not MSVC.

   <b>Hints</b>
       The following variables may be set to control search behavior:

       <b>OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR</b>
              Set to the root directory of an OpenSSL installation.

       <b>OPENSSL_USE_STATIC_LIBS</b>
              Added in version 3.4.

              Set to <b>TRUE</b> to look for static libraries.

       <b>OPENSSL_MSVC_STATIC_RT</b>
              Added in version 3.5.

              Set to <b>TRUE</b> to choose the MT version of the lib.

       <b>ENV{PKG_CONFIG_PATH}</b>
              On  UNIX-like  systems,  <b>pkg-config</b> is used to locate the system OpenSSL.  Set the <b>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</b>
              environment variable to look in alternate locations.  Useful on multi-lib systems.

   <b>FindOpenThreads</b>
       OpenThreads is a C++ based threading library.  Its largest userbase seems to OpenSceneGraph so you  might
       notice  I  accept OSGDIR as an environment path.  I consider this part of the <b>Findosg*</b> suite used to find
       OpenSceneGraph components.  Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module.

       This module defines:

       <b>OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY</b>

       <b>OPENTHREADS_FOUND</b>
              if false, do not try to link to OpenThreads

       <b>OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              where to find the headers

       <b>$OPENTHREADS_DIR</b> is an environment variable that would correspond to the:

          ./configure --prefix=$OPENTHREADS_DIR

       used in building osg.

       Added in version 2.8.10: The CMake variables <b>OPENTHREADS_DIR</b> or <b>OSG_DIR</b>  can  now  be  used  as  well  to
       influence detection, instead of needing to specify an environment variable.

   <b>Findosg</b>
       <b>NOTE:</b>
          It is highly recommended that you use the new <u>FindOpenSceneGraph</u> introduced in CMake 2.6.3 and not use
          this Find module directly.

       This  is  part  of the <b>Findosg*</b> suite used to find OpenSceneGraph components.  Each component is separate
       and you must opt in to each module.  You must also opt into  OpenGL  and  OpenThreads  (and  Producer  if
       needed) as these modules won't do it for you.  This is to allow you control over your own system piece by
       piece  in  case  you  need  to opt out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular
       module (perhaps because the default <u>FindOpenGL</u> module doesn't work with your system as an  example).   If
       you  want to use a more convenient module that includes everything, use the <u>FindOpenSceneGraph</u> instead of
       the <b>Findosg*.cmake</b> modules.

       <u>pkg_search_module()</u> commands. The following variables will also be set:

       <b>PKG_CONFIG_FOUND</b>
              True if a pkg-config executable was found.

       <b>PKG_CONFIG_VERSION_STRING</b>
              Added in version 2.8.8.

              The version of pkg-config that was found.

       <b>PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE</b>
              The pathname of the pkg-config program.

       <b>PKG_CONFIG_ARGN</b>
              Added in version 3.22.

              A list of arguments to pass to pkg-config.

       Both <b>PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE</b> and <b>PKG_CONFIG_ARGN</b> are initialized by the module, but may  be  overridden  by
       the user.  See <u>Variables</u> <u>Affecting</u> <u>Behavior</u> for how these variables are initialized.

       <b>pkg_check_modules</b>
              Checks for all the given modules, setting a variety of result variables in the calling scope.

                 pkg_check_modules(&lt;prefix&gt;
                                   [REQUIRED] [QUIET]

                                   &lt;moduleSpec&gt; [&lt;moduleSpec&gt;...])

              When the <b>REQUIRED</b> argument is given, the command will fail with an error if module(s) could not be
              found.

              When the <b>QUIET</b> argument is given, no status messages will be printed.

              Added  in version 3.1: The <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>, <u>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</u>, and <u>CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</u> cache
              and environment variables will be added to the <b>pkg-config</b>  search  path.   The  <b>NO_CMAKE_PATH</b>  and
              <b>NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH</b>  arguments disable this behavior for the cache variables and environment
              variables respectively.  The <u>PKG_CONFIG_USE_CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u> variable set to <b>FALSE</b> disables  this
              behavior globally.

              Added  in  version  3.6:  The  <b>IMPORTED_TARGET</b>  argument  will  create  an  imported  target named
              <b>PkgConfig::&lt;prefix&gt;</b> that can be passed directly as an argument to <u>target_link_libraries()</u>.

              Added in version 3.13: The <b>GLOBAL</b> argument will make  the  imported  target  available  in  global
              scope.

              Added  in  version  3.15:  Non-library  linker  options  reported  by <b>pkg-config</b> are stored in the
              <u>INTERFACE_LINK_OPTIONS</u> target property.

              Changed  in  version  3.18:  Include  directories  specified  with  <b>-isystem</b>  are  stored  in  the
              <u>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</u>  target  property.   Previous  versions  of  CMake  left them in the
              <u>INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS</u> property.

              Each <b>&lt;moduleSpec&gt;</b> can be either a bare module name or it can be  a  module  name  with  a  version
              constraint  (operators <b>=</b>, <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;=</b> and <b>&gt;=</b> are supported).  The following are examples for a module
              named <b>foo</b> with various constraints:

              • <b>foo</b> matches any version.

              • <b>foo&lt;2</b> only matches versions before 2.

              • <b>foo&gt;=3.1</b> matches any version from 3.1 or later.

              • <b>foo=1.2.3</b> requires that foo must be exactly version 1.2.3.

              The following variables may be set upon return.  Two sets of values exist: One for the common case
              (<b>&lt;XXX&gt;</b> <b>=</b> <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>) and another for the  information  <b>pkg-config</b>  provides  when  called  with  the
              <b>--static</b> option (<b>&lt;XXX&gt;</b> <b>=</b> <b>&lt;prefix&gt;_STATIC</b>).

              <b>&lt;XXX&gt;_FOUND</b>
                     set to 1 if module(s) exist

              <b>&lt;XXX&gt;_LIBRARIES</b>
                     only the libraries (without the '-l')

              <b>&lt;XXX&gt;_LINK_LIBRARIES</b>
                     the libraries and their absolute paths

              <b>&lt;XXX&gt;_LIBRARY_DIRS</b>
                     the paths of the libraries (without the '-L')

              <b>&lt;XXX&gt;_LDFLAGS</b>

              <b>&lt;XXX&gt;_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
                     the '-I' preprocessor flags (without the '-I')

              <b>&lt;XXX&gt;_CFLAGS</b>
                     all required cflags

              <b>&lt;XXX&gt;_CFLAGS_OTHER</b>
                     the other compiler flags

              All  but  <b>&lt;XXX&gt;_FOUND</b>  may  be  a  <u>;-list</u>  if the associated variable returned from <b>pkg-config</b> has
              multiple values.

              Changed  in  version  3.18:  Include  directories  specified  with  <b>-isystem</b>  are  stored  in  the
              <b>&lt;XXX&gt;_INCLUDE_DIRS</b> variable.  Previous versions of CMake left them in <b>&lt;XXX&gt;_CFLAGS_OTHER</b>.

              There  are  some special variables whose prefix depends on the number of <b>&lt;moduleSpec&gt;</b> given.  When
              there is only one <b>&lt;moduleSpec&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;YYY&gt;</b> will simply be <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>, but if  two  or  more  <b>&lt;moduleSpec&gt;</b>
              items are given, <b>&lt;YYY&gt;</b> will be <b>&lt;prefix&gt;_&lt;moduleName&gt;</b>.

              <b>&lt;YYY&gt;_VERSION</b>
                     version of the module

              <b>&lt;YYY&gt;_PREFIX</b>
                     prefix directory of the module

              <b>&lt;YYY&gt;_INCLUDEDIR</b>
                     include directory of the module

              <b>&lt;YYY&gt;_LIBDIR</b>
                     lib directory of the module

              Changed  in  version 3.8: For any given <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>, <b>pkg_check_modules()</b> can be called multiple times
              with different parameters.  Previous versions of CMake cached and returned  the  first  successful
              result.

              Changed  in  version 3.16: If a full path to the found library can't be determined, but it's still
              visible to the linker, pass it through as <b>-l&lt;name&gt;</b>.  Previous versions of  CMake  failed  in  this
              case.

              Examples:

                 pkg_check_modules (GLIB2 glib-2.0)

              Looks  for any version of glib2.  If found, the output variable <b>GLIB2_VERSION</b> will hold the actual
              version found.

                 pkg_check_modules (GLIB2 glib-2.0&gt;=2.10)

              Looks for at least version 2.10 of glib2.  If found, the output variable <b>GLIB2_VERSION</b>  will  hold
              the actual version found.

                 pkg_check_modules (FOO glib-2.0&gt;=2.10 gtk+-2.0)

              Looks  for  both glib2-2.0 (at least version 2.10) and any version of gtk2+-2.0.  Only if both are
              found will <b>FOO</b> be considered found.  The <b>FOO_glib-2.0_VERSION</b> and  <b>FOO_gtk+-2.0_VERSION</b>  variables
              will be set to their respective found module versions.

                 pkg_check_modules (XRENDER REQUIRED xrender)

              Requires any version of <b>xrender</b>.  Example output variables set by a successful call:

                 XRENDER_LIBRARIES=Xrender;X11
                 XRENDER_STATIC_LIBRARIES=Xrender;X11;pthread;Xau;Xdmcp

       <b>pkg_search_module</b>
              The  behavior of this command is the same as <u>pkg_check_modules()</u>, except that rather than checking
              for all the specified modules, it searches for just the first successful match.

                 pkg_search_module(&lt;prefix&gt;
                                   [REQUIRED] [QUIET]
                                   [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                                   [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                                   [IMPORTED_TARGET [GLOBAL]]
                                   &lt;moduleSpec&gt; [&lt;moduleSpec&gt;...])

              Added in version 3.16: If a module is found, the <b>&lt;prefix&gt;_MODULE_NAME</b> variable  will  contain  the
              name of the matching module. This variable can be used if you need to run <u>pkg_get_variable()</u>.

              Example:

                 pkg_search_module (BAR libxml-2.0 libxml2 libxml&gt;=2)

       <b>pkg_get_variable</b>
              Added in version 3.4.

              Retrieves  the  value  of  a  pkg-config  variable  <b>varName</b>  and  stores it in the result variable
              <b>resultVar</b> in the calling scope.

                 pkg_get_variable(&lt;resultVar&gt; &lt;moduleName&gt; &lt;varName&gt;
                                  [DEFINE_VARIABLES &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;...])

              If <b>pkg-config</b> returns multiple values for the specified variable, <b>resultVar</b> will contain a <u>;-list</u>.

              Options:

              <b>DEFINE_VARIABLES</b> <b>&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;...</b>
                     Added in version 3.28.

                     Specify key-value pairs  to  redefine  variables  affecting  the  variable  retrieved  with
                     <b>pkg-config</b>.

              For example:

                 pkg_get_variable(GI_GIRDIR gobject-introspection-1.0 girdir)

   <b>Variables</b> <b>Affecting</b> <b>Behavior</b>
       <b>PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE</b>
              This cache variable can be set to the path of the pkg-config executable.  <u>find_program()</u> is called
              internally by the module with this variable.

              Added   in   version  3.1:  The  <b>PKG_CONFIG</b>  environment  variable  can  be  used  as  a  hint  if
              <b>PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE</b> has not yet been set.

              Changed in version 3.22: If the <b>PKG_CONFIG</b> environment variable is set, only the first argument is
              taken from it when using it as a hint.

       <b>PKG_CONFIG_ARGN</b>
              Added in version 3.22.

              This cache variable can be set to a list of  arguments  to  additionally  pass  to  pkg-config  if
              needed.  If not provided, it will be initialized from the <b>PKG_CONFIG</b> environment variable, if set.
              The first argument in that environment variable is assumed to be the pkg-config program, while all
              remaining arguments after that are used to initialize <b>PKG_CONFIG_ARGN</b>.   If  no  such  environment
              variable is defined, <b>PKG_CONFIG_ARGN</b> is initialized to an empty string. The module does not update
              the variable once it has been set in the cache.

       <b>PKG_CONFIG_USE_CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</b>
              Added in version 3.1.

              Specifies  whether  <u>pkg_check_modules()</u>  and  <u>pkg_search_module()</u>  should  add  the  paths  in the
              <u>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</u>, <u>CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</u> and <u>CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</u> cache and  environment  variables
              to the <b>pkg-config</b> search path.

              If this variable is not set, this behavior is enabled by default if <u>CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION</u>
              is 3.1 or later, disabled otherwise.

   <b>FindPNG</b>
       Find libpng, the official reference library for the PNG image format.

   <b>Imported</b> <b>targets</b>
       Added in version 3.5.

       This module defines the following <u>IMPORTED</u> target:

       <b>PNG::PNG</b>
              The libpng library, if found.

   <b>Result</b> <b>variables</b>
       This module will set the following variables in your project:

       <b>PNG_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              where to find png.h, etc.

       <b>PNG_LIBRARIES</b>
              the libraries to link against to use PNG.

       <b>PNG_DEFINITIONS</b>
              You  should  add_definitions(${PNG_DEFINITIONS})  before  compiling code that includes png library
              files.

       <b>PNG_FOUND</b>
              If false, do not try to use PNG.

       <b>PNG_VERSION_STRING</b>
              the version of the PNG library found (since CMake 2.8.8)

   <b>Obsolete</b> <b>variables</b>
       The following variables may also be set, for backwards compatibility:

       <b>PNG_LIBRARY</b>
              where to find the PNG library.

       <b>PNG_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              where to find the PNG headers (same as PNG_INCLUDE_DIRS)

       Since PNG depends on the ZLib compression library, none of the above will be defined unless ZLib  can  be
       found.

   <b>FindPostgreSQL</b>
       Find the PostgreSQL installation.

   <b>IMPORTED</b> <b>Targets</b>
       Added in version 3.14.

       This module defines <u>IMPORTED</u> target <b>PostgreSQL::PostgreSQL</b> if PostgreSQL has been found.

   <b>Result</b> <b>Variables</b>
       This module will set the following variables in your project:

       <b>PostgreSQL_FOUND</b>
              True if PostgreSQL is found.

       <b>PostgreSQL_LIBRARIES</b>
              the PostgreSQL libraries needed for linking

       <b>PostgreSQL_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              the directories of the PostgreSQL headers

       <b>PostgreSQL_LIBRARY_DIRS</b>
              the link directories for PostgreSQL libraries

       <b>PostgreSQL_VERSION_STRING</b>
              the version of PostgreSQL found

       <b>PostgreSQL_TYPE_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              the directories of the PostgreSQL server headers

   <b>Components</b>
       This  module  contains  additional  <b>Server</b>  component,  that  forcibly  checks for the presence of server
       headers. Note that <b>PostgreSQL_TYPE_INCLUDE_DIR</b> is set regardless of the presence of the <b>Server</b>  component
       in find_package call.

   <b>FindProducer</b>
       Though Producer isn't directly part of OpenSceneGraph, its primary user is OSG so I consider this part of
       the  Findosg*  suite  used  to  find OpenSceneGraph components.  You'll notice that I accept OSGDIR as an
       environment path.

       Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module.   You  must  also  opt  into  OpenGL  (and
       OpenThreads?)  as  these  modules won't do it for you.  This is to allow you control over your own system
       piece by piece in case you need to opt out of certain components  or  change  the  Find  behavior  for  a
       particular  module  (perhaps  because  the  default <u>FindOpenGL</u> module doesn't work with your system as an
       example).   If  you  want  to  use  a  more  convenient  module  that  includes   everything,   use   the
       <u>FindOpenSceneGraph</u> instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.

       Locate Producer This module defines:

       <b>PRODUCER_LIBRARY</b>

       <b>PRODUCER_FOUND</b>
              if false, do not try to link to Producer

       <b>PRODUCER_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              where to find the headers

       <b>$PRODUCER_DIR</b> is an environment variable that would correspond to:

          ./configure --prefix=$PRODUCER_DIR

       used in building osg.

   <b>FindProtobuf</b>
       Locate and configure the Google Protocol Buffers library.

       Added in version 3.6: Support for <u>find_package()</u> version checks.

       Changed  in  version  3.6:  All  input  and  output  variables  use the <b>Protobuf_</b> prefix.  Variables with
       <b>PROTOBUF_</b> prefix are still supported for compatibility.

       The following variables can be set and are optional:

       <b>Protobuf_SRC_ROOT_FOLDER</b>
              When compiling with MSVC, if this cache variable is set  the  protobuf-default  VS  project  build
              locations     (vsprojects/Debug     and    vsprojects/Release    or    vsprojects/x64/Debug    and
              vsprojects/x64/Release) will be searched for libraries and binaries.

       <b>Protobuf_IMPORT_DIRS</b>
              List of additional directories to be searched for imported .proto files.

       <b>Protobuf_DEBUG</b>

              Show debug messages.

       <b>Protobuf_USE_STATIC_LIBS</b>
              Added in version 3.9.

              Set to ON to force the use of the static libraries.  Default is OFF.

       Defines the following variables:

       <b>Protobuf_FOUND</b>
              Found the Google Protocol Buffers library (libprotobuf &amp; header files)

       <b>Protobuf_VERSION</b>
              Added in version 3.6.

              Version of package found.

       <b>Protobuf_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              Include directories for Google Protocol Buffers

       <b>Protobuf_LIBRARIES</b>
              The protobuf libraries

       <b>Protobuf_PROTOC_LIBRARIES</b>
              The protoc libraries

       <b>Protobuf_LITE_LIBRARIES</b>
              The protobuf-lite libraries

       Added in version 3.9: The following <u>IMPORTED</u> targets are also defined:

       The following cache variables are also available to set or use:

       <b>Protobuf_LIBRARY</b>
              The protobuf library

       <b>Protobuf_PROTOC_LIBRARY</b>
              The protoc library

       <b>Protobuf_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              The include directory for protocol buffers

       <b>Protobuf_PROTOC_EXECUTABLE</b>
              The protoc compiler

       <b>Protobuf_LIBRARY_DEBUG</b>
              The protobuf library (debug)

       <b>Protobuf_PROTOC_LIBRARY_DEBUG</b>
              The protoc library (debug)

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The <b>protobuf_generate_cpp</b> and <b>protobuf_generate_python</b> functions and <u>add_executable()</u> or <u>add_library()</u>
          calls only work properly within the same directory.

       <b>protobuf_generate_cpp</b>
              Add custom commands to process <b>.proto</b> files to C++:

                 protobuf_generate_cpp (&lt;SRCS&gt; &lt;HDRS&gt;
                     [DESCRIPTORS &lt;DESC&gt;] [EXPORT_MACRO &lt;MACRO&gt;] [&lt;ARGN&gt;...])

              <b>SRCS</b>   Variable to define with autogenerated source files

              <b>HDRS</b>   Variable to define with autogenerated header files

              <b>DESCRIPTORS</b>
                     Added in  version  3.10:  Variable  to  define  with  autogenerated  descriptor  files,  if

                     [PROTOC_OPTIONS &lt;protoc_options&gt;]
                     [APPEND_PATH])

              <b>APPEND_PATH</b>
                     A flag that causes the base path of all proto schema files to be added to <b>IMPORT_DIRS</b>.

              <b>LANGUAGE</b>
                     A single value: cpp or python. Determines what kind of source files  are  being  generated.
                     Defaults to cpp.

              <b>OUT_VAR</b>
                     Name of a CMake variable that will be filled with the paths to the generated source files.

              <b>EXPORT_MACRO</b>
                     Name  of  a  macro  that  is  applied  to all generated Protobuf message classes and extern

              <b>TARGET</b> CMake target that will have the generated files added as sources.

              <b>PROTOS</b> List of proto schema files. If omitted, then every source file ending in  <u>proto</u>  of  <b>TARGET</b>
                     will be used.

              <b>IMPORT_DIRS</b>
                     A  common  parent  directory  for  the  schema  files.  For  example, if the schema file is
                     <b>proto/helloworld/helloworld.proto</b> and the import directory <b>proto/</b> then the generated  files
                     are                     <b>${PROTOC_OUT_DIR}/helloworld/helloworld.pb.h</b>                    and

   <b>FindPython</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       Find Python interpreter, compiler and development environment (include directories and libraries).

       Added in version 3.19: When a version is requested, it can be specified as a simple value or as a  range.
       For a detailed description of version range usage and capabilities, refer to the <u>find_package()</u> command.

       The following components are supported:

       • <b>Interpreter</b>: search for Python interpreter.

       • <b>Compiler</b>: search for Python compiler. Only offered by IronPython.

       • <b>Development</b>: search for development artifacts (include directories and libraries).

         Added in version 3.18: This component includes two sub-components which can be specified independently:

         • <b>Development.Module</b>: search for artifacts for Python module developments.

         • <b>Development.Embed</b>: search for artifacts for Python embedding developments.

         Added in version 3.26:

         • <b>Development.SABIModule</b>:  search  for  artifacts  for  Python  module  developments  using  the <u>Stable</u>
           <u>Application</u> <u>Binary</u> <u>Interface</u>.  This component is available only for version <b>3.2</b> and upper.

       • <b>NumPy</b>: search for NumPy include directories.

       Added in version 3.14: Added the <b>NumPy</b> component.

       If no <b>COMPONENTS</b> are specified, <b>Interpreter</b> is assumed.

       If   component   <b>Development</b>   is   specified,   it   implies   sub-components   <b>Development.Module</b>   and
       <b>Development.Embed</b>.

       To  ensure  consistent  versions  between  components  <b>Interpreter</b>,  <b>Compiler</b>, <b>Development</b> (or one of its
       sub-components) and <b>NumPy</b>, specify all components at the same time:

          find_package (Python COMPONENTS Interpreter Development)

       This module looks preferably for version 3 of Python. If not found, version 2  is  searched.   To  manage
       concurrent versions 3 and 2 of Python, use <u>FindPython3</u> and <u>FindPython2</u> modules rather than this one.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          If  components  <b>Interpreter</b>  and  <b>Development</b>  (or one of its sub-components) are both specified, this
          module search only for interpreter with same  platform  architecture  as  the  one  defined  by  CMake
          configuration. This constraint does not apply if only <b>Interpreter</b> component is specified.

   <b>Imported</b> <b>Targets</b>
       This module defines the following <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u>:

              • If not defined, search for shared libraries and static libraries in that order.

              • If set to TRUE, search <b>only</b> for static libraries.

              • If set to FALSE, search <b>only</b> for shared libraries.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This hint will be ignored on <b>Windows</b>  because  static  libraries  are  not  available  on  this
                 platform.

       <b>Python_FIND_ABI</b>
              Added in version 3.16.

              This variable defines which ABIs, as defined in <u>PEP</u> <u>3149</u>, should be searched.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This hint will be honored only when searched for <b>Python</b> version 3.

              The  <b>Python_FIND_ABI</b>  variable  is a 4-tuple specifying, in that order, <b>pydebug</b> (<b>d</b>), <b>pymalloc</b> (<b>m</b>),
              <b>unicode</b> (<b>u</b>) and <b>gil_disabled</b> (<b>t</b>) flags.

              Added in version 3.30: A fourth element, specifying the  <b>gil_disabled</b>  flag  (i.e.  free  threaded
              python), is added and is optional. If not specified, the value is <b>OFF</b>.

              Each element can be set to one of the following:

              • <b>ON</b>: Corresponding flag is selected.

              • <b>OFF</b>: Corresponding flag is not selected.

              • <b>ANY</b>: The two possibilities (<b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b>) will be searched.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If <b>Python3_FIND_ABI</b> is not defined, any ABI, excluding the <b>gil_disabled</b> flag, will be searched.

              From  this  4-tuple,  various ABIs will be searched starting from the most specialized to the most
              general. Moreover, when <b>ANY</b> is specified for <b>pydebug</b> and <b>gil_disabled</b>,  <b>debug</b>  and  <b>free</b>  <b>threaded</b>
              versions will be searched <b>after</b> <b>non-debug</b> and <b>non-gil-disabled</b> ones.

              For example, if we have:

                 set (Python_FIND_ABI "ON" "ANY" "ANY" "ON")

              The  following  flags  combinations  will be appended, in that order, to the artifact names: <b>tdmu</b>,
              <b>tdm</b>, <b>tdu</b>, and <b>td</b>.

              And to search any possible ABIs:

                 set (Python_FIND_ABI "ANY" "ANY" "ANY" "ANY")

              The following combinations, in that order, will be used: <b>mu</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>&lt;empty&gt;</b>, <b>dmu</b>, <b>dm</b>, <b>du</b>,  <b>d</b>,  <b>tmu</b>,
              <b>tm</b>, <b>tu</b>, <b>t</b>, <b>tdmu</b>, <b>tdm</b>, <b>tdu</b>, and <b>td</b>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This  hint  is  useful  only  on <b>POSIX</b> systems except for the <b>gil_disabled</b> flag. So, on <b>Windows</b>
                 systems, when <b>Python_FIND_ABI</b> is defined, <b>Python</b> distributions from <u>python.org</u>  will  be  found
                 only if the value for each flag is <b>OFF</b> or <b>ANY</b> except for the fourth one (<b>gil_disabled</b>).

       <b>Python_FIND_STRATEGY</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              This  variable  defines  how lookup will be done.  The <b>Python_FIND_STRATEGY</b> variable can be set to
              one of the following:

              • <b>VERSION</b>: Try to find the most recent version in all specified locations.  This is the default if
                policy <u>CMP0094</u> is undefined or set to <b>OLD</b>.

              • <b>LOCATION</b>: Stops lookup as soon as a version satisfying version constraints is founded.  This  is
                the default if policy <u>CMP0094</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>.

              See also <b>Python_FIND_UNVERSIONED_NAMES</b>.

       <b>Python_FIND_REGISTRY</b>
              Added in version 3.13.

              On  Windows  the  <b>Python_FIND_REGISTRY</b> variable determine the order of preference between registry
              and environment variables.  the <b>Python_FIND_REGISTRY</b> variable can be set to one of the following:

              • <b>FIRST</b>: Try to use registry before environment variables.  This is the default.

              • <b>LAST</b>: Try to use registry after environment variables.

              • <b>NEVER</b>: Never try to use registry.

       <b>Python_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              On macOS the <b>Python_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b> variable determine the order of preference between  Apple-style
              and  unix-style  package  components.   This variable can take same values as <u>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</u>
              variable.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Value <b>ONLY</b> is not supported so <b>FIRST</b> will be used instead.

              If <b>Python_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b> is not defined, <u>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</u> variable will be used, if any.

       <b>Python_FIND_VIRTUALENV</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              This variable defines the handling of virtual environments managed by <b>virtualenv</b> or <b>conda</b>.  It  is
              meaningful  only  when  a  virtual  environment  is  active  (i.e.  the  <b>activate</b>  script has been
              evaluated). In this case, it takes precedence over <b>Python_FIND_REGISTRY</b>  and  <b>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b>
              variables.  The <b>Python_FIND_VIRTUALENV</b> variable can be set to one of the following:

              • <b>FIRST</b>:  The  virtual  environment  is  used  before  any other standard paths to look-up for the
                interpreter. This is the default.

              • <b>ONLY</b>: Only the virtual environment is used to look-up for the interpreter.

              • <b>STANDARD</b>: The virtual environment is not used to look-up for  the  interpreter  but  environment
                variable  <b>PATH</b>  is  always considered.  In this case, variable <b>Python_FIND_REGISTRY</b> (Windows) or
                <b>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b> (macOS) can be set with value  <b>LAST</b>  or  <b>NEVER</b>  to  select  preferably  the
                interpreter from the virtual environment.

              Added in version 3.17: Added support for <b>conda</b> environments.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If  the  component  <b>Development</b>  is  requested,  it is <b>strongly</b> recommended to also include the
                 component <b>Interpreter</b> to get expected result.

       <b>Python_FIND_IMPLEMENTATIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              This variable defines, in an ordered list, the different implementations which will  be  searched.
              The <b>Python_FIND_IMPLEMENTATIONS</b> variable can hold the following values:

              • <b>CPython</b>:  this  is the standard implementation. Various products, like <b>Anaconda</b> or <b>ActivePython</b>,
                rely on this implementation.

              • <b>IronPython</b>: This implementation use the <b>CSharp</b> language for <b>.NET</b> <b>Framework</b> on top of the <u>Dynamic</u>
                <u>Language</u> <u>Runtime</u> (<b>DLR</b>).  See <u>IronPython</u>.

              • <b>PyPy</b>: This implementation use <b>RPython</b> language and <b>RPython</b> <b>translation</b> <b>toolchain</b> to produce  the
                python interpreter.  See <u>PyPy</u>.

              The default value is:

              • Windows platform: <b>CPython</b>, <b>IronPython</b>

              • Other platforms: <b>CPython</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This hint has the lowest priority of all hints, so even if, for example, you specify <b>IronPython</b>
                 first  and  <b>CPython</b>  in  second, a python product based on <b>CPython</b> can be selected because, for
                 example with <b>Python_FIND_STRATEGY=LOCATION</b>, each location will be search first  for  <b>IronPython</b>
                 and second for <b>CPython</b>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 When  <b>IronPython</b> is specified, on platforms other than <b>Windows</b>, the <b>.Net</b> interpreter (i.e. <b>mono</b>
                 command) is expected to be available through the <b>PATH</b> variable.

       <b>Python_FIND_UNVERSIONED_NAMES</b>
              Added in version 3.20.

              This variable defines how the generic names will be searched. Currently, it only  applies  to  the
              generic   names   of   the   interpreter,   namely,   <b>python3</b>   or   <b>python2</b>   and   <b>python</b>.   The
              <b>Python_FIND_UNVERSIONED_NAMES</b> variable can be set to one of the following values:

              • <b>FIRST</b>: The generic names are searched before the more specialized ones (such  as  <b>python2.5</b>  for
                example).

              • <b>LAST</b>: The generic names are searched after the more specialized ones.  This is the default.

              • <b>NEVER</b>: The generic name are not searched at all.

              See also <b>Python_FIND_STRATEGY</b>.

   <b>Artifacts</b> <b>Specification</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       To  solve  special  cases,  it  is  possible  to  specify directly the artifacts by setting the following
       variables:

       <b>Python_EXECUTABLE</b>
              The path to the interpreter.

       <b>Python_COMPILER</b>
              The path to the compiler.

       <b>Python_DOTNET_LAUNCHER</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              The <b>.Net</b> interpreter. Only used by <b>IronPython</b> implementation.

       <b>Python_LIBRARY</b>
              The  path  to  the  library.  It  will  be  used  to  compute  the   variables   <b>Python_LIBRARIES</b>,
              <b>Python_LIBRARY_DIRS</b> and <b>Python_RUNTIME_LIBRARY_DIRS</b>.

       <b>Python_SABI_LIBRARY</b>
              Added in version 3.26.

              The  path  to  the library for Stable Application Binary Interface. It will be used to compute the
              variables <b>Python_SABI_LIBRARIES</b>, <b>Python_SABI_LIBRARY_DIRS</b> and <b>Python_RUNTIME_SABI_LIBRARY_DIRS</b>.

       <b>Python_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              The path to the directory of the  <b>Python</b>  headers.  It  will  be  used  to  compute  the  variable
              <b>Python_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>.

       <b>Python_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              The  path  to  the  directory  of  the  <b>NumPy</b>  headers.  It  will  be used to compute the variable
              <b>Python_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          All paths must be absolute. Any artifact specified with a relative path will be ignored.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          When an artifact is specified, all <b>HINTS</b> will be ignored and no search  will  be  performed  for  this
          artifact.

          If  more  than one artifact is specified, it is the user's responsibility to ensure the consistency of
          the various artifacts.

       By default, this module supports multiple calls in different directories  of  a  project  with  different
       version/component  requirements  while providing correct and consistent results for each call. To support
       this behavior, CMake cache is not used in the traditional way which can be  problematic  for  interactive
       specification.  So,  to enable also interactive specification, module behavior can be controlled with the
       following variable:

       <b>Python_ARTIFACTS_INTERACTIVE</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              Selects the behavior of the module. This is a boolean variable:

              • If set to <b>TRUE</b>: Create CMake cache entries for the above  artifact  specification  variables  so
                that  users  can  edit them interactively.  This disables support for multiple version/component
                requirements.

              • If set to <b>FALSE</b> or undefined: Enable multiple version/component requirements.

   <b>Commands</b>
       This module defines the command <b>Python_add_library</b> (when <u>CMAKE_ROLE</u>  is  <b>PROJECT</b>),  which  has  the  same
       semantics  as  <u>add_library()</u>  and  adds  a  dependency  to target <b>Python::Python</b> or, when library type is
       <b>MODULE</b>, to target <b>Python::Module</b> or <b>Python::SABIModule</b> (when <b>USE_SABI</b> option is specified) and takes care
       of Python module naming rules:

          Python_add_library (&lt;name&gt; [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE [USE_SABI &lt;version&gt;] [WITH_SOABI]]
                              &lt;source1&gt; [&lt;source2&gt; ...])

       If the library type is not specified, <b>MODULE</b> is assumed.

       Added in version 3.17: For <b>MODULE</b> library type, if option <b>WITH_SOABI</b> is specified, the module suffix will
       include the <b>Python_SOABI</b> value, if any.

       Added in version 3.26: For <b>MODULE</b> type, if the option <b>USE_SABI</b> is specified, the preprocessor  definition
       <b>Py_LIMITED_API</b>  will  be  specified,  as  <b>PRIVATE</b>,  for  the  target  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> with the value computed from
       <b>&lt;version&gt;</b> argument.  The expected format for <b>&lt;version&gt;</b>  is  <b>major[.minor]</b>,  where  each  component  is  a
       numeric value. If <b>minor</b> component is specified, the version should be, at least, <b>3.2</b> which is the version
       where  the  <u>Stable</u>  <u>Application</u>  <u>Binary</u>  <u>Interface</u>  was  introduced.  Specifying  only major version <b>3</b> is
       equivalent to <b>3.2</b>.

       When option <b>WITH_SOABI</b> is also specified,  the module suffix will include  the  <b>Python_SOSABI</b>  value,  if
       any.

       Added  in  version 3.30: For <b>MODULE</b> type, the <u>DEBUG_POSTFIX</u> target property is initialized with the value
       of <b>Python_DEBUG_POSTFIX</b> variable if defined.

   <b>FindPython2</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       Find Python 2 interpreter, compiler and development environment (include directories and libraries).

       Added in version 3.19: When a version is requested, it can be specified as a simple value or as a  range.
       For a detailed description of version range usage and capabilities, refer to the <u>find_package()</u> command.

       The following components are supported:

       • <b>Interpreter</b>: search for Python 2 interpreter

       • <b>Compiler</b>: search for Python 2 compiler. Only offered by IronPython.

       • <b>Development</b>: search for development artifacts (include directories and libraries).

         Added in version 3.18: This component includes two sub-components which can be specified independently:

         • <b>Development.Module</b>: search for artifacts for Python 2 module developments.

         • <b>Development.Embed</b>: search for artifacts for Python 2 embedding developments.

       • <b>NumPy</b>: search for NumPy include directories.

       Added in version 3.14: Added the <b>NumPy</b> component.

       If no <b>COMPONENTS</b> are specified, <b>Interpreter</b> is assumed.

       If   component   <b>Development</b>   is   specified,   it   implies   sub-components   <b>Development.Module</b>   and
       <b>Development.Embed</b>.

       To ensure consistent versions between components  <b>Interpreter</b>,  <b>Compiler</b>,  <b>Development</b>  (or  one  of  its
       sub-components) and <b>NumPy</b>, specify all components at the same time:

          find_package (Python2 COMPONENTS Interpreter Development)

       This  module  looks  only  for version 2 of Python. This module can be used concurrently with <u>FindPython3</u>
       module to use both Python versions.

       The <u>FindPython</u> module can be used if Python version does not matter for you.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          If components <b>Interpreter</b> and <b>Development</b> (or one of its  sub-components)  are  both  specified,  this
          module  search  only  for  interpreter  with  same  platform  architecture as the one defined by CMake
          configuration. This constraint does not apply if only <b>Interpreter</b> component is specified.

   <b>Imported</b> <b>Targets</b>
       This module defines the following <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u>:

       Changed in version 3.14: <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u> are only created when <u>CMAKE_ROLE</u> is <b>PROJECT</b>.

              one of the following:

              • <b>VERSION</b>: Try to find the most recent version in all specified locations.  This is the default if
                policy <u>CMP0094</u> is undefined or set to <b>OLD</b>.

              • <b>LOCATION</b>: Stops lookup as soon as a version satisfying version constraints is founded.  This  is
                the default if policy <u>CMP0094</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>.

              See also <b>Python2_FIND_UNVERSIONED_NAMES</b>.

              and environment variables.  the <b>Python2_FIND_REGISTRY</b> variable can be set to one of the following:

              • <b>FIRST</b>: Try to use registry before environment variables.  This is the default.

              • <b>LAST</b>: Try to use registry after environment variables.

              • <b>NEVER</b>: Never try to use registry.

       <b>Python2_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              On macOS the <b>Python2_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b> variable determine the order of preference between Apple-style

              variable.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Value <b>ONLY</b> is not supported so <b>FIRST</b> will be used instead.

              If <b>Python2_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b> is not defined, <u>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</u> variable will be used, if any.

       <b>Python2_FIND_VIRTUALENV</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              This  variable  defines the handling of virtual environments managed by <b>virtualenv</b> or <b>conda</b>. It is
              meaningful only when  a  virtual  environment  is  active  (i.e.  the  <b>activate</b>  script  has  been
              evaluated).  In this case, it takes precedence over <b>Python2_FIND_REGISTRY</b> and <b>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b>
              variables.  The <b>Python2_FIND_VIRTUALENV</b> variable can be set to one of the following:

              • <b>FIRST</b>: The virtual environment is used before any  other  standard  paths  to  look-up  for  the
                interpreter. This is the default.

              • <b>ONLY</b>: Only the virtual environment is used to look-up for the interpreter.

              • <b>STANDARD</b>:  The  virtual  environment  is not used to look-up for the interpreter but environment
                variable <b>PATH</b> is always considered.  In this case, variable <b>Python2_FIND_REGISTRY</b>  (Windows)  or
                <b>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b>  (macOS)  can  be  set  with  value  <b>LAST</b> or <b>NEVER</b> to select preferably the
                interpreter from the virtual environment.

              Added in version 3.17: Added support for <b>conda</b> environments.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If the component <b>Development</b> is requested, it is  <b>strongly</b>  recommended  to  also  include  the
                 component <b>Interpreter</b> to get expected result.

       <b>Python2_FIND_IMPLEMENTATIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              This  variable  defines, in an ordered list, the different implementations which will be searched.
              The <b>Python2_FIND_IMPLEMENTATIONS</b> variable can hold the following values:

              • <b>CPython</b>: this is the standard implementation. Various products, like <b>Anaconda</b>  or  <b>ActivePython</b>,
                rely on this implementation.

              • <b>IronPython</b>: This implementation use the <b>CSharp</b> language for <b>.NET</b> <b>Framework</b> on top of the <u>Dynamic</u>
                <u>Language</u> <u>Runtime</u> (<b>DLR</b>).  See <u>IronPython</u>.

              • <b>PyPy</b>:  This implementation use <b>RPython</b> language and <b>RPython</b> <b>translation</b> <b>toolchain</b> to produce the
                python interpreter.  See <u>PyPy</u>.

              The default value is:

              • Windows platform: <b>CPython</b>, <b>IronPython</b>

              • Other platforms: <b>CPython</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This hint has the lowest priority of all hints, so even if, for example, you specify <b>IronPython</b>
                 first and <b>CPython</b> in second, a python product based on <b>CPython</b> can  be  selected  because,  for
                 example  with <b>Python2_FIND_STRATEGY=LOCATION</b>, each location will be search first for <b>IronPython</b>
                 and second for <b>CPython</b>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 When <b>IronPython</b> is specified, on platforms other than <b>Windows</b>, the <b>.Net</b> interpreter (i.e.  <b>mono</b>
                 command) is expected to be available through the <b>PATH</b> variable.

       <b>Python2_FIND_UNVERSIONED_NAMES</b>
              Added in version 3.20.

              This  variable  defines  how the generic names will be searched. Currently, it only applies to the
              generic names of the interpreter, namely, <b>python2</b> and <b>python</b>.  The  <b>Python2_FIND_UNVERSIONED_NAMES</b>
              variable can be set to one of the following values:

              • <b>FIRST</b>:  The  generic  names are searched before the more specialized ones (such as <b>python2.5</b> for
                example).

              • <b>LAST</b>: The generic names are searched after the more specialized ones.  This is the default.

              • <b>NEVER</b>: The generic name are not searched at all.

              See also <b>Python2_FIND_STRATEGY</b>.

   <b>Artifacts</b> <b>Specification</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       To solve special cases, it is possible to  specify  directly  the  artifacts  by  setting  the  following
       variables:

       <b>Python2_EXECUTABLE</b>
              The path to the interpreter.

       <b>Python2_COMPILER</b>
              The path to the compiler.

       <b>Python2_DOTNET_LAUNCHER</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              The <b>.Net</b> interpreter. Only used by <b>IronPython</b> implementation.

       <b>Python2_LIBRARY</b>
              The   path  to  the  library.  It  will  be  used  to  compute  the  variables  <b>Python2_LIBRARIES</b>,
              <b>Python2_LIBRARY_DIRS</b> and <b>Python2_RUNTIME_LIBRARY_DIRS</b>.

       <b>Python2_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              The path to the directory of the  <b>Python</b>  headers.  It  will  be  used  to  compute  the  variable
              <b>Python2_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>.

       <b>Python2_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              The  path  to  the  directory  of  the  <b>NumPy</b>  headers.  It  will  be used to compute the variable
              <b>Python2_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          All paths must be absolute. Any artifact specified with a relative path will be ignored.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          When an artifact is specified, all <b>HINTS</b> will be ignored and no search  will  be  performed  for  this
          artifact.

          If  more  than one artifact is specified, it is the user's responsibility to ensure the consistency of
          the various artifacts.

       By default, this module supports multiple calls in different directories  of  a  project  with  different
       version/component  requirements  while providing correct and consistent results for each call. To support
       this behavior, CMake cache is not used in the traditional way which can be  problematic  for  interactive
       specification.  So,  to enable also interactive specification, module behavior can be controlled with the
       following variable:

       <b>Python2_ARTIFACTS_INTERACTIVE</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              Selects the behavior of the module. This is a boolean variable:

              • If set to <b>TRUE</b>: Create CMake cache entries for the above  artifact  specification  variables  so
                that  users  can  edit them interactively.  This disables support for multiple version/component
                requirements.

              • If set to <b>FALSE</b> or undefined: Enable multiple version/component requirements.

   <b>Commands</b>
       This module defines the command <b>Python2_add_library</b> (when <u>CMAKE_ROLE</u> is  <b>PROJECT</b>),  which  has  the  same
       semantics  as  <u>add_library()</u>  and  adds  a  dependency to target <b>Python2::Python</b> or, when library type is
       <b>MODULE</b>, to target <b>Python2::Module</b> and takes care of Python module naming rules:

          Python2_add_library (&lt;name&gt; [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]
                               &lt;source1&gt; [&lt;source2&gt; ...])

       If library type is not specified, <b>MODULE</b> is assumed.

       Added in version 3.30: For <b>MODULE</b> type, the <u>DEBUG_POSTFIX</u> target property is initialized with  the  value
       of <b>Python2_DEBUG_POSTFIX</b> variable if defined.

   <b>FindPython3</b>
       Added in version 3.12.

       Find Python 3 interpreter, compiler and development environment (include directories and libraries).

       Added  in version 3.19: When a version is requested, it can be specified as a simple value or as a range.
       For a detailed description of version range usage and capabilities, refer to the <u>find_package()</u> command.

       The following components are supported:

       • <b>Interpreter</b>: search for Python 3 interpreter

       • <b>Compiler</b>: search for Python 3 compiler. Only offered by IronPython.

       • <b>Development</b>: search for development artifacts (include directories and libraries).

         Added in version 3.18: This component includes two sub-components which can be specified independently:

         • <b>Development.Module</b>: search for artifacts for Python 3 module developments.

         • <b>Development.Embed</b>: search for artifacts for Python 3 embedding developments.

         Added in version 3.26:

         • <b>Development.SABIModule</b>: search for artifacts for  Python  3  module  developments  using  the  <u>Stable</u>
           <u>Application</u> <u>Binary</u> <u>Interface</u>.  This component is available only for version <b>3.2</b> and upper.

       • <b>NumPy</b>: search for NumPy include directories.

       Added in version 3.14: Added the <b>NumPy</b> component.

       If no <b>COMPONENTS</b> are specified, <b>Interpreter</b> is assumed.

       If   component   <b>Development</b>   is   specified,   it   implies   sub-components   <b>Development.Module</b>   and
       <b>Development.Embed</b>.

       To ensure consistent versions between components  <b>Interpreter</b>,  <b>Compiler</b>,  <b>Development</b>  (or  one  of  its
       sub-components) and <b>NumPy</b>, specify all components at the same time:

          find_package (Python3 COMPONENTS Interpreter Development)

       This  module  looks  only  for version 3 of Python. This module can be used concurrently with <u>FindPython2</u>
       module to use both Python versions.

       The <u>FindPython</u> module can be used if Python version does not matter for you.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          If components <b>Interpreter</b> and <b>Development</b> (or one of its  sub-components)  are  both  specified,  this
          module  search  only  for  interpreter  with  same  platform  architecture as the one defined by CMake
          configuration. This constraint does not apply if only <b>Interpreter</b> component is specified.

   <b>Imported</b> <b>Targets</b>
       This module defines the following <u>Imported</u> <u>Targets</u>:

              • If set to TRUE, search <b>only</b> for static libraries.

              • If set to FALSE, search <b>only</b> for shared libraries.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This  hint  will  be  ignored  on  <b>Windows</b>  because  static libraries are not available on this
                 platform.

       <b>Python3_FIND_ABI</b>
              Added in version 3.16.

              This variable defines which ABIs, as defined in <u>PEP</u> <u>3149</u>, should be searched.

              The <b>Python3_FIND_ABI</b> variable is a 4-tuple specifying, in that order, <b>pydebug</b> (<b>d</b>),  <b>pymalloc</b>  (<b>m</b>),
              <b>unicode</b> (<b>u</b>) and <b>gil_disabled</b> (<b>t</b>) flags.

              Added  in  version  3.30:  A  fourth element, specifying the <b>gil_disabled</b> flag (i.e. free threaded
              python), is added and is optional. If not specified, the value is <b>OFF</b>.

              Each element can be set to one of the following:

              • <b>ON</b>: Corresponding flag is selected.

              • <b>OFF</b>: Corresponding flag is not selected.

              • <b>ANY</b>: The two possibilities (<b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b>) will be searched.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If <b>Python3_FIND_ABI</b> is not defined, any ABI, excluding the <b>gil_disabled</b> flag, will be searched.

              From this 4-tuple, various ABIs will be searched starting from the most specialized  to  the  most
              general.  Moreover,  when  <b>ANY</b>  is specified for <b>pydebug</b> and <b>gil_disabled</b>, <b>debug</b> and <b>free</b> <b>threaded</b>
              versions will be searched <b>after</b> <b>non-debug</b> and <b>non-gil-disabled</b> ones.

              For example, if we have:

                 set (Python3_FIND_ABI "ON" "ANY" "ANY" "ON")

              The following flags combinations will be appended, in that order, to  the  artifact  names:  <b>tdmu</b>,
              <b>tdm</b>, <b>tdu</b>, and <b>td</b>.

              And to search any possible ABIs:

                 set (Python3_FIND_ABI "ANY" "ANY" "ANY" "ANY")

              The  following  combinations, in that order, will be used: <b>mu</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>&lt;empty&gt;</b>, <b>dmu</b>, <b>dm</b>, <b>du</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>tmu</b>,
              <b>tm</b>, <b>tu</b>, <b>t</b>, <b>tdmu</b>, <b>tdm</b>, <b>tdu</b>, and <b>td</b>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This hint is useful only on <b>POSIX</b> systems except for the  <b>gil_disabled</b>  flag.  So,  on  <b>Windows</b>
                 systems,  when  <b>Python_FIND_ABI</b>  is defined, <b>Python</b> distributions from <u>python.org</u> will be found
                 only if the value for each flag is <b>OFF</b> or <b>ANY</b> except for the fourth one (<b>gil_disabled</b>).

       <b>Python3_FIND_STRATEGY</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              This variable defines how lookup will be done.  The <b>Python3_FIND_STRATEGY</b> variable can be  set  to
              one of the following:

              • <b>VERSION</b>: Try to find the most recent version in all specified locations.  This is the default if
                policy <u>CMP0094</u> is undefined or set to <b>OLD</b>.

              • <b>LOCATION</b>:  Stops lookup as soon as a version satisfying version constraints is founded.  This is
                the default if policy <u>CMP0094</u> is set to <b>NEW</b>.

              See also <b>Python3_FIND_UNVERSIONED_NAMES</b>.

       <b>Python3_FIND_REGISTRY</b>
              Added in version 3.13.

              On Windows the <b>Python3_FIND_REGISTRY</b> variable determine the order of preference  between  registry
              and environment variables.  The <b>Python3_FIND_REGISTRY</b> variable can be set to one of the following:

              • <b>FIRST</b>: Try to use registry before environment variables.  This is the default.

              • <b>LAST</b>: Try to use registry after environment variables.

              • <b>NEVER</b>: Never try to use registry.

       <b>Python3_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              On macOS the <b>Python3_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b> variable determine the order of preference between Apple-style
              and  unix-style  package  components.   This variable can take same values as <u>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</u>
              variable.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Value <b>ONLY</b> is not supported so <b>FIRST</b> will be used instead.

              If <b>Python3_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b> is not defined, <u>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</u> variable will be used, if any.

       <b>Python3_FIND_VIRTUALENV</b>
              Added in version 3.15.

              This variable defines the handling of virtual environments managed by <b>virtualenv</b> or <b>conda</b>.  It  is
              meaningful  only  when  a  virtual  environment  is  active  (i.e.  the  <b>activate</b>  script has been
              evaluated). In this case, it takes precedence over <b>Python3_FIND_REGISTRY</b> and  <b>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b>
              variables.  The <b>Python3_FIND_VIRTUALENV</b> variable can be set to one of the following:

              • <b>FIRST</b>:  The  virtual  environment  is  used  before  any other standard paths to look-up for the
                interpreter. This is the default.

              • <b>ONLY</b>: Only the virtual environment is used to look-up for the interpreter.

              • <b>STANDARD</b>: The virtual environment is not used to look-up for  the  interpreter  but  environment
                variable  <b>PATH</b>  is always considered.  In this case, variable <b>Python3_FIND_REGISTRY</b> (Windows) or
                <b>CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK</b> (macOS) can be set with value  <b>LAST</b>  or  <b>NEVER</b>  to  select  preferably  the
                interpreter from the virtual environment.

              Added in version 3.17: Added support for <b>conda</b> environments.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If  the  component  <b>Development</b>  is  requested,  it is <b>strongly</b> recommended to also include the
                 component <b>Interpreter</b> to get expected result.

       <b>Python3_FIND_IMPLEMENTATIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              This variable defines, in an ordered list, the different implementations which will  be  searched.
              The <b>Python3_FIND_IMPLEMENTATIONS</b> variable can hold the following values:

              • <b>CPython</b>:  this  is the standard implementation. Various products, like <b>Anaconda</b> or <b>ActivePython</b>,
                rely on this implementation.

              • <b>IronPython</b>: This implementation use the <b>CSharp</b> language for <b>.NET</b> <b>Framework</b> on top of the <u>Dynamic</u>
                <u>Language</u> <u>Runtime</u> (<b>DLR</b>).  See <u>IronPython</u>.

              • <b>PyPy</b>: This implementation use <b>RPython</b> language and <b>RPython</b> <b>translation</b> <b>toolchain</b> to produce  the
                python interpreter.  See <u>PyPy</u>.

              The default value is:

              • Windows platform: <b>CPython</b>, <b>IronPython</b>

              • Other platforms: <b>CPython</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This hint has the lowest priority of all hints, so even if, for example, you specify <b>IronPython</b>
                 first  and  <b>CPython</b>  in  second, a python product based on <b>CPython</b> can be selected because, for
                 example with <b>Python3_FIND_STRATEGY=LOCATION</b>, each location will be search first for  <b>IronPython</b>
                 and second for <b>CPython</b>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 When  <b>IronPython</b> is specified, on platforms other than <b>Windows</b>, the <b>.Net</b> interpreter (i.e. <b>mono</b>
                 command) is expected to be available through the <b>PATH</b> variable.

       <b>Python3_FIND_UNVERSIONED_NAMES</b>
              Added in version 3.20.

              This variable defines how the generic names will be searched. Currently, it only  applies  to  the
              generic  names of the interpreter, namely, <b>python3</b> and <b>python</b>.  The <b>Python3_FIND_UNVERSIONED_NAMES</b>
              variable can be set to one of the following values:

              • <b>FIRST</b>: The generic names are searched before the more specialized ones (such  as  <b>python3.5</b>  for
                example).

              • <b>LAST</b>: The generic names are searched after the more specialized ones.  This is the default.

              • <b>NEVER</b>: The generic name are not searched at all.

              See also <b>Python3_FIND_STRATEGY</b>.

   <b>Artifacts</b> <b>Specification</b>
       Added in version 3.16.

       To  solve  special  cases,  it  is  possible  to  specify directly the artifacts by setting the following
       variables:

       <b>Python3_EXECUTABLE</b>
              The path to the interpreter.

       <b>Python3_COMPILER</b>
              The path to the compiler.

       <b>Python3_DOTNET_LAUNCHER</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              The <b>.Net</b> interpreter. Only used by <b>IronPython</b> implementation.

       <b>Python3_LIBRARY</b>
              The  path  to  the  library.  It  will  be  used  to  compute  the  variables   <b>Python3_LIBRARIES</b>,
              <b>Python3_LIBRARY_DIRS</b> and <b>Python3_RUNTIME_LIBRARY_DIRS</b>.

       <b>Python3_SABI_LIBRARY</b>
              Added in version 3.26.

              The  path  to  the library for Stable Application Binary Interface. It will be used to compute the
              variables <b>Python3_SABI_LIBRARIES</b>, <b>Python3_SABI_LIBRARY_DIRS</b> and <b>Python3_RUNTIME_SABI_LIBRARY_DIRS</b>.

       <b>Python3_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              The path to the directory of the  <b>Python</b>  headers.  It  will  be  used  to  compute  the  variable
              <b>Python3_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>.

       <b>Python3_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              The  path  to  the  directory  of  the  <b>NumPy</b>  headers.  It  will  be used to compute the variable
              <b>Python3_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          All paths must be absolute. Any artifact specified with a relative path will be ignored.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          When an artifact is specified, all <b>HINTS</b> will be ignored and no search  will  be  performed  for  this
          artifact.

          If  more  than one artifact is specified, it is the user's responsibility to ensure the consistency of
          the various artifacts.

       By default, this module supports multiple calls in different directories  of  a  project  with  different
       version/component  requirements  while providing correct and consistent results for each call. To support
       this behavior, CMake cache is not used in the traditional way which can be  problematic  for  interactive
       specification.  So,  to enable also interactive specification, module behavior can be controlled with the
       following variable:

       <b>Python3_ARTIFACTS_INTERACTIVE</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              Selects the behavior of the module. This is a boolean variable:

              • If set to <b>TRUE</b>: Create CMake cache entries for the above  artifact  specification  variables  so
                that  users  can  edit them interactively.  This disables support for multiple version/component
                requirements.

              • If set to <b>FALSE</b> or undefined: Enable multiple version/component requirements.

   <b>Commands</b>
       This module defines the command <b>Python3_add_library</b> (when <u>CMAKE_ROLE</u> is  <b>PROJECT</b>),  which  has  the  same
       semantics  as  <u>add_library()</u>  and  adds  a  dependency to target <b>Python3::Python</b> or, when library type is
       <b>MODULE</b>, to target <b>Python3::Module</b> or <b>Python3::SABIModule</b> (when <b>USE_SABI</b> option is  specified)  and  takes
       care of Python module naming rules:

          Python3_add_library (&lt;name&gt; [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE [USE_SABI &lt;version&gt;] [WITH_SOABI]]
                               &lt;source1&gt; [&lt;source2&gt; ...])

       If the library type is not specified, <b>MODULE</b> is assumed.

       Added in version 3.17: For <b>MODULE</b> library type, if option <b>WITH_SOABI</b> is specified, the module suffix will
       include the <b>Python3_SOABI</b> value, if any.

       Added  in version 3.26: For <b>MODULE</b> type, if the option <b>USE_SABI</b> is specified, the preprocessor definition
       <b>Py_LIMITED_API</b> will be specified, as <b>PRIVATE</b>,  for  the  target  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>  with  the  value  computed  from
       <b>&lt;version&gt;</b>  argument.   The  expected  format  for  <b>&lt;version&gt;</b>  is <b>major[.minor]</b>, where each component is a
       numeric value. If <b>minor</b> component is specified, the version should be, at least, <b>3.2</b> which is the version
       where the <u>Stable</u> <u>Application</u> <u>Binary</u>  <u>Interface</u>  was  introduced.  Specifying  only  major  version  <b>3</b>  is
       equivalent to <b>3.2</b>.

       When  option  <b>WITH_SOABI</b>  is also specified,  the module suffix will include the <b>Python3_SOSABI</b> value, if
       any.

       Added in version 3.30: For <b>MODULE</b> type, the <u>DEBUG_POSTFIX</u> target property is initialized with  the  value
       of <b>Python3_DEBUG_POSTFIX</b> variable if defined.

   <b>FindQt3</b>
       Locate Qt include paths and libraries

       This module defines:

          QT_INCLUDE_DIR    - where to find qt.h, etc.
          QT_LIBRARIES      - the libraries to link against to use Qt.
          QT_DEFINITIONS    - definitions to use when
                              compiling code that uses Qt.
          QT_FOUND          - If false, don't try to use Qt.
          QT_VERSION_STRING - the version of Qt found

       If you need the multithreaded version of Qt, set QT_MT_REQUIRED to TRUE

       Also defined, but not for general use are:

          QT_MOC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the moc tool.
          QT_UIC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the uic tool.
          QT_QT_LIBRARY, where to find the Qt library.
          QT_QTMAIN_LIBRARY, where to find the qtmain
           library. This is only required by Qt3 on Windows.

   <b>FindQt4</b>
   <b>Finding</b> <b>and</b> <b>Using</b> <b>Qt4</b>
       This module can be used to find Qt4.  The most important issue is that the Qt4 qmake is available via the
       system  path.  This qmake is then used to detect basically everything else.  This module defines a number
       of <u>IMPORTED</u> targets, macros and variables.

       Typical usage could be something like:

          set(CMAKE_AUTOMOC ON)
          set(CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR ON)
          find_package(Qt4 4.4.3 REQUIRED QtGui QtXml)
          add_executable(myexe main.cpp)
          target_link_libraries(myexe Qt4::QtGui Qt4::QtXml)

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          When using <u>IMPORTED</u> targets, the qtmain.lib static library is  automatically  linked  on  Windows  for
          <u>WIN32</u>  executables.  To disable that globally, set the <b>QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN</b> variable before finding Qt4.
          To disable that for a particular executable, set the <b>QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN</b> target property to <b>TRUE</b> on the
          executable.

   <b>Qt</b> <b>Build</b> <b>Tools</b>
       Qt relies on some bundled tools for code generation, such as <b>moc</b> for meta-object code generation, <b>uic</b> for
       widget layout and population, and <b>rcc</b> for virtual filesystem content  generation.   These  tools  may  be
       automatically invoked by <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u> if the appropriate conditions are met.  See <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u> for more.

   <b>Qt</b> <b>Macros</b>
       In  some  cases  it can be necessary or useful to invoke the Qt build tools in a more-manual way. Several
       macros are available to add targets for such uses.

          macro QT4_WRAP_CPP(outfiles inputfile ... [TARGET tgt] OPTIONS ...)
                create moc code from a list of files containing Qt class with
                the Q_OBJECT declaration.  Per-directory preprocessor definitions
                are also added.  If the &lt;tgt&gt; is specified, the
                INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from
                the &lt;tgt&gt; are passed to moc.  Options may be given to moc, such as
                those found when executing "moc -help".

          macro QT4_WRAP_UI(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
                create code from a list of Qt designer ui files.
                Options may be given to uic, such as those found
                when executing "uic -help"

          macro QT4_ADD_RESOURCES(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
                create code from a list of Qt resource files.
                Options may be given to rcc, such as those found
                when executing "rcc -help"

          macro QT4_GENERATE_MOC(inputfile outputfile [TARGET tgt])
                creates a rule to run moc on infile and create outfile.
                Use this if for some reason QT4_WRAP_CPP() isn't appropriate, e.g.
                because you need a custom filename for the moc file or something
                similar.  If the &lt;tgt&gt; is specified, the
                INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from
                the &lt;tgt&gt; are passed to moc.

          macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE(outfiles interface basename)
                Create the interface header and implementation files with the
                given basename from the given interface xml file and add it to
                the list of sources.

                You can pass additional parameters to the qdbusxml2cpp call by setting
                properties on the input file:

                INCLUDE the given file will be included in the generate interface header

                CLASSNAME the generated class is named accordingly

                NO_NAMESPACE the generated class is not wrapped in a namespace

          macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACES(outfiles inputfile ... )
                Create the interface header and implementation files
                for all listed interface xml files.
                The basename will be automatically determined from the name
                of the xml file.

                The source file properties described for
                QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE also apply here.

          macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_ADAPTOR(outfiles xmlfile parentheader parentclassname
                                     [basename] [classname])
                create a dbus adaptor (header and implementation file) from the xml file
                describing the interface, and add it to the list of sources. The adaptor
                forwards the calls to a parent class, defined in parentheader and named
                parentclassname. The name of the generated files will be
                &lt;basename&gt;adaptor.{cpp,h} where basename defaults to the basename of the
                xml file.
                If &lt;classname&gt; is provided, then it will be used as the classname of the
                adaptor itself.

          macro QT4_GENERATE_DBUS_INTERFACE( header [interfacename] OPTIONS ...)
                generate the xml interface file from the given header.
                If the optional argument interfacename is omitted, the name of the
                interface file is constructed from the basename of the header with
                the suffix .xml appended.
                Options may be given to qdbuscpp2xml, such as those found when
                executing "qdbuscpp2xml --help"

          macro QT4_CREATE_TRANSLATION( qm_files directories ... sources ...
                                        ts_files ... OPTIONS ...)
                out: qm_files
                in:  directories sources ts_files
                options: flags to pass to lupdate, such as -extensions to specify
                extensions for a directory scan.
                generates commands to create .ts (via lupdate) and .qm
                (via lrelease) - files from directories and/or sources. The ts files are
                created and/or updated in the source tree (unless given with full paths).
                The qm files are generated in the build tree.
                Updating the translations can be done by adding the qm_files
                to the source list of your library/executable, so they are
                always updated, or by adding a custom target to control when
                they get updated/generated.

          macro QT4_ADD_TRANSLATION( qm_files ts_files ... )
                out: qm_files
                in:  ts_files
                generates commands to create .qm from .ts - files. The generated
                filenames can be found in qm_files. The ts_files
                must exist and are not updated in any way.

          macro QT4_AUTOMOC(sourcefile1 sourcefile2 ... [TARGET tgt])
                The qt4_automoc macro is obsolete.  Use the CMAKE_AUTOMOC feature instead.
                This macro is still experimental.
                It can be used to have moc automatically handled.
                So if you have the files foo.h and foo.cpp, and in foo.h a
                a class uses the Q_OBJECT macro, moc has to run on it. If you don't
                want to use QT4_WRAP_CPP() (which is reliable and mature), you can insert
                #include "foo.moc"
                in foo.cpp and then give foo.cpp as argument to QT4_AUTOMOC(). This will
                scan all listed files at cmake-time for such included moc files and if it
                finds them cause a rule to be generated to run moc at build time on the
                accompanying header file foo.h.
                If a source file has the SKIP_AUTOMOC property set it will be ignored by
                this macro.
                If the &lt;tgt&gt; is specified, the INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and
                INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from the &lt;tgt&gt; are passed to moc.

          function QT4_USE_MODULES( target [link_type] modules...)
                 This function is obsolete. Use target_link_libraries with IMPORTED targets
                 instead.
                 Make &lt;target&gt; use the &lt;modules&gt; from Qt. Using a Qt module means
                 to link to the library, add the relevant include directories for the
                 module, and add the relevant compiler defines for using the module.
                 Modules are roughly equivalent to components of Qt4, so usage would be
                 something like:
                  qt4_use_modules(myexe Core Gui Declarative)
                 to use QtCore, QtGui and QtDeclarative. The optional &lt;link_type&gt; argument
                 can be specified as either LINK_PUBLIC or LINK_PRIVATE to specify the
                 same argument to the target_link_libraries call.

   <b>IMPORTED</b> <b>Targets</b>
       A  particular  Qt  library  may  be  used  by  using  the  corresponding   <u>IMPORTED</u>   target   with   the
       <u>target_link_libraries()</u> command:

          target_link_libraries(myexe Qt4::QtGui Qt4::QtXml)

       Using  a  target  in  this  way  causes :<a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)` to use the appropriate include directories and compile
       definitions for the target when compiling <b>myexe</b>.

       Targets are aware of their dependencies, so for example it  is  not  necessary  to  list  <b>Qt4::QtCore</b>  if
       another Qt library is listed, and it is not necessary to list <b>Qt4::QtGui</b> if <b>Qt4::QtDeclarative</b> is listed.
       Targets may be tested for existence in the usual way with the <u>if(TARGET)</u> command.

       The  Qt  toolkit  may  contain  both  debug  and release libraries.  <u><a href="../man1/cmake.1.html">cmake</a>(1)</u> will choose the appropriate
       version based on the build configuration.

       <b>Qt4::QtCore</b>
              The QtCore target

       <b>Qt4::QtGui</b>
              The QtGui target

       <b>Qt4::Qt3Support</b>
              The Qt3Support target

       <b>Qt4::QtAssistant</b>
              The QtAssistant target

       <b>Qt4::QtAssistantClient</b>

       The minimum required version of Ruby can be specified using the standard syntax, e.g.

          find_package(Ruby 3.2.6 EXACT REQUIRED)
          # OR
          find_package(Ruby 3.2)

       Virtual environments such as RVM are handled as well, by passing the argument <b>Ruby_FIND_VIRTUALENV</b>

   <b>Result</b> <b>Variables</b>
       This module will set the following variables in your project:

       <b>Ruby_FOUND</b>
              set to true if ruby was found successfully

       <b>Ruby_EXECUTABLE</b>
              full path to the ruby binary

       <b>Ruby_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              include dirs to be used when using the ruby library

       <b>Ruby_LIBRARIES</b>
              Added in version 3.18: libraries needed to use ruby from C.

       <b>Ruby_VERSION</b>
              the version of ruby which was found, e.g. "3.2.6"

       <b>Ruby_VERSION_MAJOR</b>

              Ruby minor version.

       <b>Ruby_VERSION_PATCH</b>
              Ruby patch version.

       Changed in version 3.18: Previous versions of CMake  used  the  <b>RUBY_</b>  prefix  for  all  variables.   The
       following variables are provided for compatibility reasons, don't use them in new code:

       <b>RUBY_EXECUTABLE</b>
              same as Ruby_EXECUTABLE.

       <b>RUBY_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              same as Ruby_INCLUDE_DIRS.

              same as Ruby_VERSION.

       <b>RUBY_FOUND</b>
              same as Ruby_FOUND.

   <b>Hints</b>
       Added in version 3.18.

       <b>Ruby_FIND_VIRTUALENV</b>
              This  variable  defines the handling of virtual environments managed by <b>rvm</b>. It is meaningful only
              when a virtual environment is active (i.e. the <b>rvm</b> script has  been  evaluated  or  at  least  the
              <b>MY_RUBY_HOME</b>  environment variable is set).  The <b>Ruby_FIND_VIRTUALENV</b> variable can be set to empty
              or one of the following:

              • <b>FIRST</b>: The virtual environment is used before any  other  standard  paths  to  look-up  for  the
                interpreter. This is the default.

              • <b>ONLY</b>: Only the virtual environment is used to look-up for the interpreter.

              • <b>STANDARD</b>:  The virtual environment is not used to look-up for the interpreter (assuming it isn't
                still in the PATH...)

   <b>FindSDL</b>
       Locate the SDL library

   <b>Imported</b> <b>targets</b>
       Added in version 3.19.

       This module defines the following <u>IMPORTED</u> target:

       <b>SDL::SDL</b>
              The SDL library, if found

   <b>Result</b> <b>variables</b>
       This module will set the following variables in your project:

       <b>SDL_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              where to find SDL.h

       <b>SDL_LIBRARIES</b>
              the name of the library to link against

       <b>SDL_FOUND</b>
              if false, do not try to link to SDL

       <b>SDL_VERSION</b>
              the human-readable string containing the version of SDL if found

       <b>SDL_VERSION_MAJOR</b>
              SDL major version

       <b>SDL_VERSION_MINOR</b>
              SDL minor version

       <b>SDL_VERSION_PATCH</b>
              SDL patch version

       Added in version 3.19: Added the <b>SDL_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>, <b>SDL_LIBRARIES</b> and <b>SDL_VERSION[_&lt;PART&gt;]</b> variables.

   <b>Cache</b> <b>variables</b>
       These variables may optionally be set to help this module find the correct files:

       <b>SDL_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              where to find SDL.h

       <b>SDL_LIBRARY</b>
              the name of the library to link against

   <b>Variables</b> <b>for</b> <b>locating</b> <b>SDL</b>
       This module responds to the flag:

       <b>SDL_BUILDING_LIBRARY</b>
              If this is defined, then no SDL_main will be linked in  because  only  applications  need  main().
              Otherwise,  it  is  assumed you are building an application and this module will attempt to locate
              and set the proper link flags as part of the returned SDL_LIBRARY variable.

   <b>Obsolete</b> <b>variables</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.19.

       These variables are obsolete and provided for backwards compatibility:

       <b>SDL_VERSION_STRING</b>
              the human-readable string containing the version of SDL if found.  Identical to SDL_VERSION

       Don't forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your project  for  the  OS  X  framework  based  version.
       (Other versions link to -lSDLmain which this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this
       module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.

       Additional  Note: If you see an empty SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP in your configuration and no SDL_LIBRARY, it means
       CMake did not find your SDL library (SDL.dll, libsdl.so, SDL.framework, etc).   Set  SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP  to
       point  to  your  SDL  library,  and configure again.  Similarly, if you see an empty SDLMAIN_LIBRARY, you
       should set this value as appropriate.  These values are used to generate the final SDL_LIBRARY  variable,
       but when these values are unset, SDL_LIBRARY does not get created.

       $SDLDIR  is  an  environment  variable  that would correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in
       building SDL.  l.e.galup 9-20-02

       On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.   People  will  have  to  manually
       change  the  cache  values  of  SDL_LIBRARY  to  override  this  selection  or  set the CMake environment
       CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.

       Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h This needed to change because "proper"
       SDL convention is #include "SDL.h", not &lt;SDL/SDL.h&gt;.  This is done for portability  reasons  because  not
       all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).

   <b>FindSDL_image</b>
       Locate SDL_image library

       This module defines:

          SDL_IMAGE_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against

                                     version of SDL_mixer

       For backward compatibility the following variables are also set:

          SDLMIXER_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_MIXER_LIBRARIES)
          SDLMIXER_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_MIXER_INCLUDE_DIRS)
          SDLMIXER_FOUND (same value as SDL_MIXER_FOUND)

       building SDL.

   <b>FindSDL_sound</b>
       Locates the SDL_sound library

       This module depends on SDL being found and must be called AFTER FindSDL.cmake is called.

       This module defines

          SDL_SOUND_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL_sound.h
          SDL_SOUND_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL_sound
          SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES, this contains the list of libraries that you need
            to link against.
          SDL_SOUND_EXTRAS, this is an optional variable for you to add your own
            flags to SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES. This is prepended to SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES.
            This is available mostly for cases this module failed to anticipate for
            and you must add additional flags. This is marked as ADVANCED.
          SDL_SOUND_VERSION_STRING, human-readable string containing the
            version of SDL_sound

       This module also defines (but you shouldn't need to use directly)

          SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY, the name of just the SDL_sound library you would link
          against. Use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES for you link instructions and not this one.

       And might define the following as needed

          MIKMOD_LIBRARY
          MODPLUG_LIBRARY
          OGG_LIBRARY
          VORBIS_LIBRARY
          SMPEG_LIBRARY
          FLAC_LIBRARY
          SPEEX_LIBRARY

       Typically,  you  should  not  use  these variables directly, and you should use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES which
       contains SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY and the other audio libraries (if needed)  to  successfully  compile  on  your
       system.

       Responds  to the $SDLDIR and $SDLSOUNDDIR environmental variable that would correspond to the ./configure
       --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.

       On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.   People  will  have  to  manually
       change  the  cache  values  of  SDL_LIBRARY  to  override  this  selectionor  set  the  CMake environment
       CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.

   <b>FindSquish</b>
       -- Typical Use

       This module can be used to find Squish.

          SQUISH_FOUND                    If false, don't try to use Squish

          SQUISH_CLIENT_EXECUTABLE        The squishrunner executable

          SQUISH_INSTALL_DIR_FOUND        Was the install directory found?
          SQUISH_SERVER_EXECUTABLE_FOUND  Was the server executable found?
          SQUISH_CLIENT_EXECUTABLE_FOUND  Was the client executable found?

       It provides the function squish_add_test() for adding a squish test to cmake using Squish &gt;= 4.x:

          squish_add_test(cmakeTestName
            AUT targetName SUITE suiteName TEST squishTestName
            [SETTINGSGROUP group] [PRE_COMMAND command] [POST_COMMAND command] )

       Changed in version 3.18: In previous CMake versions, this function was named <b>squish_v4_add_test</b>.

       The arguments have the following meaning:

       <b>cmakeTestName</b>
              this will be used as the first argument for add_test()

       <b>AUT</b> <b>targetName</b>
              the name of the cmake target which will be used as AUT, i.e. the executable which will be tested.

       <b>SUITE</b> <b>suiteName</b>
              this is either the full path to the squish suite, or just the last directory of  the  suite,  i.e.
              the  suite  name. In this case the CMakeLists.txt which calls squish_add_test() must be located in
              the parent directory of the suite directory.

       <b>TEST</b> <b>squishTestName</b>
              the name of the squish test, i.e. the name of the  subdirectory  of  the  test  inside  the  suite
              directory.

       <b>SETTINGSGROUP</b> <b>group</b>
              deprecated, this argument will be ignored.

       <b>PRE_COMMAND</b> <b>command</b>
              if specified, the given command will be executed before starting the squish test.

       <b>POST_COMMAND</b> <b>command</b>
              same as PRE_COMMAND, but after the squish test has been executed.

          enable_testing()
          find_package(Squish 6.5)
          if (SQUISH_FOUND)
             squish_add_test(myTestName
               AUT myApp
               SUITE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/tests/mySuite
               TEST someSquishTest
               )
          endif ()

       For users of Squish version 3.x the macro squish_v3_add_test() is provided:

          squish_v3_add_test(testName applicationUnderTest testCase envVars testWrapper)
          Use this macro to add a test using Squish 3.x.

          enable_testing()
          find_package(Squish 3.0)
          if (SQUISH_FOUND)

       <b>SQLite3_FOUND</b>
              TRUE if found

   <b>FindSubversion</b>
       Extract information from a subversion working copy

       The module defines the following variables:

          Subversion_SVN_EXECUTABLE - path to svn command line client
          Subversion_VERSION_SVN - version of svn command line client
          Subversion_FOUND - true if the command line client was found
          SUBVERSION_FOUND - same as Subversion_FOUND, set for compatibility reasons

       The   minimum  required  version  of  Subversion  can  be  specified  using  the  standard  syntax,  e.g.
       <b>find_package(Subversion</b> <b>1.4)</b>.

       If the command line client executable is found two macros are defined:

          Subversion_WC_INFO(&lt;dir&gt; &lt;var-prefix&gt; [IGNORE_SVN_FAILURE])
          Subversion_WC_LOG(&lt;dir&gt; &lt;var-prefix&gt;)

       <b>Subversion_WC_INFO</b> extracts information of a subversion working copy at a  given  location.   This  macro
       defines  the  following  variables  if  running  Subversion's <b>info</b> command on <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> succeeds; otherwise a
       <b>SEND_ERROR</b> message is generated.

       Added in version 3.13: The error can be ignored by providing the <b>IGNORE_SVN_FAILURE</b> option, which  causes
       these variables to remain undefined.

          &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_URL - url of the repository (at &lt;dir&gt;)
          &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_ROOT - root url of the repository
          &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_REVISION - current revision
          &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_LAST_CHANGED_AUTHOR - author of last commit
          &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_LAST_CHANGED_DATE - date of last commit
          &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_LAST_CHANGED_REV - revision of last commit
          &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_INFO - output of command `svn info &lt;dir&gt;'

       <b>Subversion_WC_LOG</b>  retrieves the log message of the base revision of a subversion working copy at a given
       location.  This macro defines the variable:

          &lt;var-prefix&gt;_LAST_CHANGED_LOG - last log of base revision

       Example usage:

          find_package(Subversion)
          if(SUBVERSION_FOUND)
            Subversion_WC_INFO(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} Project)
            message("Current revision is ${Project_WC_REVISION}")
            Subversion_WC_LOG(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} Project)
            message("Last changed log is ${Project_LAST_CHANGED_LOG}")
          endif()

   <b>FindSWIG</b>
       Find the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (<u>SWIG</u>) executable.

       This module finds an installed SWIG and determines its version.

       Added in version 3.18: If a <b>COMPONENTS</b> or <b>OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS</b> argument is  given  to  the  <u>find_package()</u>
       command, it will also determine supported target languages.

       Added  in version 3.19: When a version is requested, it can be specified as a simple value or as a range.
       For a detailed description of version range usage and capabilities, refer to the <u>find_package()</u> command.

       The module defines the following variables:

       <b>SWIG_FOUND</b>
              Whether SWIG and any required components were found on the system.

       <b>SWIG_EXECUTABLE</b>
              Path to the SWIG executable.

       <b>SWIG_DIR</b>
              Path to the installed SWIG <b>Lib</b> directory (result of <b>swig</b> <b>-swiglib</b>).

       <b>SWIG_VERSION</b>
              SWIG executable version (result of <b>swig</b> <b>-version</b>).

       <b>SWIG_&lt;lang&gt;_FOUND</b>
              If <b>COMPONENTS</b>  or  <b>OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS</b>  are  requested,  each  available  target  language  <b>&lt;lang&gt;</b>
              (lowercase) will be set to TRUE.

       Any <b>COMPONENTS</b> given to <b>find_package</b> should be the names of supported target languages as provided to the
       LANGUAGE argument of <b>swig_add_library</b>, such as <b>python</b> or <b>perl5</b>. Language names <u>must</u> be lowercase.

       All information is collected from the <b>SWIG_EXECUTABLE</b>, so the version to be found can be changed from the
       command line by means of setting <b>SWIG_EXECUTABLE</b>.

       Example usage requiring SWIG 4.0 or higher and Python language support, with optional Fortran support:

          find_package(SWIG 4.0 COMPONENTS python OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS fortran)
          if(SWIG_FOUND)
            message("SWIG found: ${SWIG_EXECUTABLE}")
            if(NOT SWIG_fortran_FOUND)
              message(WARNING "SWIG Fortran bindings cannot be generated")
            endif()
          endif()

   <b>FindTCL</b>
       TK_INTERNAL_PATH was removed.

       This  module finds if Tcl is installed and determines where the include files and libraries are.  It also
       determines what the name of the library is.  This code sets the following variables:

          TCL_FOUND              = Tcl was found
          TK_FOUND               = Tk was found
          TCLTK_FOUND            = Tcl and Tk were found
          TCL_LIBRARY            = path to Tcl library (tcl tcl80)
          TCL_INCLUDE_PATH       = path to where tcl.h can be found
          TCL_TCLSH              = path to tclsh binary (tcl tcl80)
          TK_LIBRARY             = path to Tk library (tk tk80 etc)
          TK_INCLUDE_PATH        = path to where tk.h can be found
          TK_WISH                = full path to the wish executable

       In an effort to remove some clutter and clear up some issues for people who are  not  necessarily  Tcl/Tk
       gurus/developers, some variables were moved or removed.  Changes compared to CMake 2.4 are:

          =&gt; they were only useful for people writing Tcl/Tk extensions.
          =&gt; these libs are not packaged by default with Tcl/Tk distributions.
             Even when Tcl/Tk is built from source, several flavors of debug libs
             are created and there is no real reason to pick a single one
             specifically (say, amongst tcl84g, tcl84gs, or tcl84sgx).
             Let's leave that choice to the user by allowing him to assign
             TCL_LIBRARY to any Tcl library, debug or not.
          =&gt; this ended up being only a Win32 variable, and there is a lot of
             confusion regarding the location of this file in an installed Tcl/Tk
             tree anyway (see 8.5 for example). If you need the internal path at
             this point it is safer you ask directly where the *source* tree is
             and dig from there.

   <b>FindTclsh</b>
       Find tclsh

       This  module finds if TCL is installed and determines where the include files and libraries are.  It also
       determines what the name of the library is.  This code sets the following variables:

          TCLSH_FOUND = TRUE if tclsh has been found
          TCL_TCLSH = the path to the tclsh executable

   <b>FindTclStub</b>
       TCL_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG and TK_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG were removed.

       This module finds Tcl stub libraries.  It  first  finds  Tcl  include  files  and  libraries  by  calling
       FindTCL.cmake.  How to Use the Tcl Stubs Library:

          TK_STUB_LIBRARY        = path to Tk stub library
          TTK_STUB_LIBRARY       = path to ttk stub library

   <b>FindThreads</b>
       This module determines the thread library of the system.

   <b>Imported</b> <b>Targets</b>
       Added in version 3.1.

       This module defines the following <u>IMPORTED</u> target:

       <b>Threads::Threads</b>
              The thread library, if found.

   <b>Result</b> <b>Variables</b>
       The following variables are set:

       <b>Threads_FOUND</b>
              If a supported thread library was found.

       <b>CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT</b>
              The thread library to use. This may be empty if the thread functions are provided  by  the  system
              libraries and no special flags are needed to use them.

       <b>CMAKE_USE_WIN32_THREADS_INIT</b>
              If the found thread library is the win32 one.

       <b>CMAKE_USE_PTHREADS_INIT</b>
              If the found thread library is pthread compatible.

       <b>CMAKE_HP_PTHREADS_INIT</b>
              If the found thread library is the HP thread library.

   <b>Variables</b> <b>Affecting</b> <b>Behavior</b>
       <b>THREADS_PREFER_PTHREAD_FLAG</b>
              Added in version 3.1.

              If  the  use  of  the  -pthread compiler and linker flag is preferred then the caller can set this
              variable to TRUE. The compiler flag can only be used with the imported target.  Use  of  both  the
              imported target as well as this switch is highly recommended for new code.

              This  variable  has  no  effect  if  the  system libraries provide the thread functions, i.e. when
              <b>CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT</b> will be empty.

       Added in version 3.14: <b>OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS</b> support.

       There are two search branches: a windows style and a unix style.  For windows,  the  following  variables
       are  searched  for  and set to defaults in case of multiple choices.  Change them if the defaults are not
       desired (i.e., these are the only variables you should change to select a configuration):

          wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR      - Base wxWidgets directory
                                    (e.g., C:/wxWidgets-3.2.0).
          wxWidgets_LIB_DIR       - Path to wxWidgets libraries
                                    (e.g., C:/wxWidgets-3.2.0/lib/vc_x64_lib).
          wxWidgets_CONFIGURATION - Configuration to use
                                    (e.g., msw, mswd, mswu, mswunivud, etc.)
          wxWidgets_EXCLUDE_COMMON_LIBRARIES
                                  - Set to TRUE to exclude linking of
                                    commonly required libs (e.g., png tiff
                                    jpeg zlib regex expat scintilla lexilla).

       For unix style it uses the wx-config  utility.   You  can  select  between  debug/release,  unicode/ansi,
       universal/non-universal,  and  static/shared  in  the QtDialog or ccmake interfaces by turning ON/OFF the
       following variables:

          wxWidgets_USE_DEBUG
          wxWidgets_USE_UNICODE
          wxWidgets_USE_UNIVERSAL
          wxWidgets_USE_STATIC

       There is also a wxWidgets_CONFIG_OPTIONS variable for all other options that need to  be  passed  to  the
       wx-config  utility.   For example, to use the base toolkit found in the <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a> path, set the variable
       (before calling the FIND_PACKAGE command) as such:

          set(wxWidgets_CONFIG_OPTIONS --toolkit=base --prefix=<a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>)

       The following are set after the configuration is done for both windows and unix style:

          wxWidgets_FOUND            - Set to TRUE if wxWidgets was found.
          wxWidgets_INCLUDE_DIRS     - Include directories for WIN32
                                       i.e., where to find "wx/wx.h" and
                                       "wx/setup.h"; possibly empty for unices.
          wxWidgets_LIBRARIES        - Path to the wxWidgets libraries.
          wxWidgets_LIBRARY_DIRS     - compile time link dirs, useful for
                                       rpath on UNIX. Typically an empty string
                                       in WIN32 environment.
          wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS      - Contains defines required to compile/link
                                       against WX, e.g. WXUSINGDLL
          wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG- Contains defines required to compile/link
                                       against WX debug builds, e.g. __WXDEBUG__
          wxWidgets_CXX_FLAGS        - Include dirs and compiler flags for
                                       unices, empty on WIN32. Essentially
                                       "`wx-config --cxxflags`".
          wxWidgets_USE_FILE         - Convenience include file.

       Added in version 3.11: The following environment variables can be used as hints: <b>WX_CONFIG</b>, <b>WXRC_CMD</b>.

       Sample usage:

          # Note that for MinGW users the order of libs is important!
          find_package(wxWidgets COMPONENTS gl core base OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS net)
          if(wxWidgets_FOUND)
            include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
            # and for each of your dependent executable/library targets:
            target_link_libraries(&lt;YourTarget&gt; ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})
          endif()

       If wxWidgets is required (i.e., not an optional part):

          find_package(wxWidgets REQUIRED gl core base OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS net)
          include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
          # and for each of your dependent executable/library targets:
          target_link_libraries(&lt;YourTarget&gt; ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})

              &lt;testee&gt;. Supported target types for testee are Frameworks and App Bundles:

                 xctest_add_bundle(
                   &lt;target&gt;  # Name of the XCTest bundle
                   &lt;testee&gt;  # Target name of the testee
                   )

       <b>xctest_add_test</b>
              The  <b>xctest_add_test</b> function adds an XCTest bundle to the project to be run by <u><a href="../man1/ctest.1.html">ctest</a>(1)</u>. The test
              will be named &lt;name&gt; and tests &lt;bundle&gt;:

                 xctest_add_test(
                   &lt;name&gt;    # Test name
                   &lt;bundle&gt;  # Target name of XCTest bundle

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATED</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Deprecated</b> <b>Utility</b> <b>Modules</b>
   <b>AddFileDependencies</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.20.

       Add dependencies to a source file.

          add_file_dependencies(&lt;source&gt; &lt;files&gt;...)

       Adds the given <b>&lt;files&gt;</b> to the dependencies of file <b>&lt;source&gt;</b>.

       Do not use this command in new code.  It is just a wrapper around:

          set_property(SOURCE &lt;source&gt; APPEND PROPERTY OBJECT_DEPENDS &lt;files&gt;...)

       Instead use the <u>set_property()</u> command to append to the <u>OBJECT_DEPENDS</u> source file property directly.

   <b>CMakeDetermineVSServicePack</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.0: Do not use.

       The  functionality  of this module has been superseded by the <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION</u> variable that
       contains the compiler version number.

       Determine the Visual Studio service pack of the 'cl' in use.

       Usage:

          if(MSVC)
            include(CMakeDetermineVSServicePack)
            DetermineVSServicePack( my_service_pack )
            if( my_service_pack )
              message(STATUS "Detected: ${my_service_pack}")
            endif()
          endif()

       Function DetermineVSServicePack sets the given variable to one of the following values or an empty string
       if unknown:

          vc80, vc80sp1
          vc90, vc90sp1
          vc100, vc100sp1
          vc110, vc110sp1, vc110sp2, vc110sp3, vc110sp4

   <b>CMakeExpandImportedTargets</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.4: Do not use.

       This module was once needed to expand imported targets to the underlying libraries they reference on disk
       for use with the <u>try_compile()</u> and <u>try_run()</u> commands.  These commands now support imported libraries  in
       their <b>LINK_LIBRARIES</b> options (since CMake 2.8.11 for <u>try_compile()</u> and since CMake 3.2 for <u>try_run()</u>).

       This  module  does  not  support  the  policy <u>CMP0022</u> <b>NEW</b> behavior or use of the <u>INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES</u>
       property because <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u> cannot be evaluated during configuration.

          CMAKE_EXPAND_IMPORTED_TARGETS(&lt;var&gt; LIBRARIES lib1 lib2...libN
                                        [CONFIGURATION &lt;config&gt;])

       CMAKE_EXPAND_IMPORTED_TARGETS() takes a list of libraries and replaces all imported targets contained  in
       this  list with their actual file paths of the referenced libraries on disk, including the libraries from
       their link interfaces.  If a CONFIGURATION is given, it uses the respective configuration of the imported
       targets  if  it  exists.   If  no  CONFIGURATION  is  given,  it  uses  the  first   configuration   from
       ${CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES} if set, otherwise ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}.

   <b>CMakeFindFrameworks</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.31: This module does nothing, unless policy <u>CMP0173</u> is set to <b>OLD</b>.

       helper module to find OSX frameworks

       This module reads hints about search locations from variables:

          CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK_EXTRA_LOCATIONS - Extra directories

   <b>CMakeForceCompiler</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.6: Do not use.

       The  macros  provided  by  this module were once intended for use by cross-compiling toolchain files when
       CMake was not able to automatically detect the compiler identification.  Since the introduction  of  this
       module, CMake's compiler identification capabilities have improved and can now be taught to recognize any
       compiler.  Furthermore, the suite of information CMake detects from a compiler is now too extensive to be
       provided by toolchain files using these macros.

       One  common  use  case  for  this  module  was to skip CMake's checks for a working compiler when using a
       cross-compiler that cannot link binaries without special flags or custom linker scripts.   This  case  is
       now supported by setting the <u>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</u> variable in the toolchain file instead.

                                                         ----

       Macro <b>CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER</b> has the following signature:

          CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER(&lt;compiler&gt; &lt;compiler-id&gt;)

       It sets <u>CMAKE_C_COMPILER</u> to the given compiler and the cmake internal variable <u>CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID</u> to the
       given compiler-id.  It also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic compiler information tests.

       Macro <b>CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER</b> has the following signature:

          CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER(&lt;compiler&gt; &lt;compiler-id&gt;)

       It sets <u>CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER</u> to the given compiler and the cmake internal variable <u>CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID</u> to
       the  given  compiler-id.   It also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic compiler information
       tests.

       Macro <b>CMAKE_FORCE_Fortran_COMPILER</b> has the following signature:

          CMAKE_FORCE_Fortran_COMPILER(&lt;compiler&gt; &lt;compiler-id&gt;)

       It  sets   <u>CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER</u>   to   the   given   compiler   and   the   cmake   internal   variable
       <u>CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_ID</u>  to the given compiler-id.  It also bypasses the check for working compiler and
       basic compiler information tests.

       So a simple toolchain file could look like this:

          include (CMakeForceCompiler)
          set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Generic)
          CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER   (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)
          CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)

   <b>CMakeParseArguments</b>
       This module once implemented the <u>cmake_parse_arguments()</u> command that  is  now  implemented  natively  by
       CMake.  It is now an empty placeholder for compatibility with projects that include it to get the command
       from CMake 3.4 and lower.

   <b>Dart</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.27: This module is available only if policy <u>CMP0145</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b>.  Do not
       use it in new code.  Use the <u>CTest</u> module instead.

       Configure a project for testing with CTest or old Dart Tcl Client

       This  file  is the backwards-compatibility version of the CTest module.  It supports using the old Dart 1
       Tcl client for driving dashboard submissions as well as  testing  with  CTest.   This  module  should  be
       included in the CMakeLists.txt file at the top of a project.  Typical usage:

          include(Dart)
          if(BUILD_TESTING)
            # ... testing related CMake code ...
          endif()

       The  BUILD_TESTING  option  is  created by the Dart module to determine whether testing support should be
       enabled.  The default is ON.

   <b>Documentation</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.18: This module does nothing, unless policy <u>CMP0106</u> is set to <b>OLD</b>.

       This module provides support for the VTK documentation framework.  It relies on several  tools  (Doxygen,
       Perl, etc).

   <b>GetPrerequisites</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.16: Use <u>file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)</u> instead.

       Functions to analyze and list executable file prerequisites.

       This module provides functions to list the .dll, .dylib or .so files that an executable or shared library
       file depends on.  (Its prerequisites.)

       It uses various tools to obtain the list of required shared library files:

          dumpbin (Windows)
          objdump (MinGW on Windows)
          ldd (Linux/Unix)
          otool (Mac OSX)

       Changed in version 3.16: The tool specified by <b>CMAKE_OBJDUMP</b> will be used, if set.

       The following functions are provided by this module:

          get_prerequisites
          list_prerequisites
          list_prerequisites_by_glob
          gp_append_unique
          is_file_executable
          gp_item_default_embedded_path
            (projects can override with gp_item_default_embedded_path_override)
          gp_resolve_item
            (projects can override with gp_resolve_item_override)
          gp_resolved_file_type
            (projects can override with gp_resolved_file_type_override)
          gp_file_type

          GET_PREREQUISITES(&lt;target&gt; &lt;prerequisites_var&gt; &lt;exclude_system&gt; &lt;recurse&gt;
                            &lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt; [&lt;rpaths&gt;])

       Get  the  list  of  shared  library  files  required  by  &lt;target&gt;.   The  list  in  the  variable  named
       &lt;prerequisites_var&gt; should be empty on first entry to this function.  On exit,  &lt;prerequisites_var&gt;  will
       contain the list of required shared library files.

       &lt;target&gt;  is the full path to an executable file.  &lt;prerequisites_var&gt; is the name of a CMake variable to
       contain the results.  &lt;exclude_system&gt; must be 0 or 1 indicating whether to include or  exclude  "system"
       prerequisites.   If  &lt;recurse&gt;  is set to 1 all prerequisites will be found recursively, if set to 0 only
       direct prerequisites  are  listed.   &lt;exepath&gt;  is  the  path  to  the  top  level  executable  used  for
       @executable_path replacement on the Mac.  &lt;dirs&gt; is a list of paths where libraries might be found: these
       paths  are  searched  first when a target without any path info is given.  Then standard system locations
       are also searched: PATH, Framework locations, /usr/lib...

       Added in version 3.14: The variable GET_PREREQUISITES_VERBOSE can  be  set  to  true  to  enable  verbose
       output.

          LIST_PREREQUISITES(&lt;target&gt; [&lt;recurse&gt; [&lt;exclude_system&gt; [&lt;verbose&gt;]]])

       Print a message listing the prerequisites of &lt;target&gt;.

       &lt;target&gt;  is  the  name  of a shared library or executable target or the full path to a shared library or
       executable file.  If &lt;recurse&gt; is set to 1 all prerequisites will be found recursively, if set to 0  only
       direct  prerequisites  are  listed.   &lt;exclude_system&gt;  must  be  0 or 1 indicating whether to include or
       exclude "system" prerequisites.  With &lt;verbose&gt; set to 0 only the full path names  of  the  prerequisites
       are printed, set to 1 extra information will be displayed.

          LIST_PREREQUISITES_BY_GLOB(&lt;glob_arg&gt; &lt;glob_exp&gt;)

       Print  the  prerequisites of shared library and executable files matching a globbing pattern.  &lt;glob_arg&gt;
       is  GLOB  or  GLOB_RECURSE  and  &lt;glob_exp&gt;  is  a  globbing  expression   used   with   "file(GLOB"   or
       "file(GLOB_RECURSE"  to  retrieve  a  list  of  matching  files.   If  a matching file is executable, its
       prerequisites are listed.

       Any additional (optional)  arguments  provided  are  passed  along  as  the  optional  arguments  to  the
       list_prerequisites calls.

          GP_APPEND_UNIQUE(&lt;list_var&gt; &lt;value&gt;)

       Append &lt;value&gt; to the list variable &lt;list_var&gt; only if the value is not already in the list.

          IS_FILE_EXECUTABLE(&lt;file&gt; &lt;result_var&gt;)

       Return 1 in &lt;result_var&gt; if &lt;file&gt; is a binary executable, 0 otherwise.

          GP_ITEM_DEFAULT_EMBEDDED_PATH(&lt;item&gt; &lt;default_embedded_path_var&gt;)

       Return the path that others should refer to the item by when the item is embedded inside a bundle.

       Override  on  a  per-project basis by providing a project-specific gp_item_default_embedded_path_override
       function.

          GP_RESOLVE_ITEM(&lt;context&gt; &lt;item&gt; &lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt; &lt;resolved_item_var&gt;
                          [&lt;rpaths&gt;])

       Resolve an item into an existing full path file.

       Override on a per-project basis by providing a project-specific gp_resolve_item_override function.

          GP_RESOLVED_FILE_TYPE(&lt;original_file&gt; &lt;file&gt; &lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt; &lt;type_var&gt;
                                [&lt;rpaths&gt;])

       Return the type of &lt;file&gt; with respect to &lt;original_file&gt;.  String describing  type  of  prerequisite  is
       returned in variable named &lt;type_var&gt;.

       Use  &lt;exepath&gt; and &lt;dirs&gt; if necessary to resolve non-absolute &lt;file&gt; values -- but only for non-embedded
       items.

       Possible types are:

          system
          local
          embedded
          other

       Override on a per-project basis by providing a project-specific gp_resolved_file_type_override function.

   <b>WriteCompilerDetectionHeader</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.20: This module is available only if policy <u>CMP0120</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b>.  Do not
       use it in new code.

       Added in version 3.1.

       This module provides the function <b>write_compiler_detection_header()</b>.

       This function can be used to generate a file suitable for preprocessor inclusion which contains macros to
       be used in source code:

          write_compiler_detection_header(
                    FILE &lt;file&gt;
                    PREFIX &lt;prefix&gt;
                    [OUTPUT_FILES_VAR &lt;output_files_var&gt; OUTPUT_DIR &lt;output_dir&gt;]
                    COMPILERS &lt;compiler&gt; [...]
                    FEATURES &lt;feature&gt; [...]
                    [BARE_FEATURES &lt;feature&gt; [...]]
                    [VERSION &lt;version&gt;]
                    [PROLOG &lt;prolog&gt;]
                    [EPILOG &lt;epilog&gt;]
                    [ALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILERS]
                    [ALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILER_VERSIONS]
          )

       This generates the file <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> with macros which all have the prefix <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>.

       By default, all content is written directly to the <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>.  The  <b>OUTPUT_FILES_VAR</b>  may  be  specified  to
       cause  the  compiler-specific  content  to  be  written  to  separate files.  The separate files are then
       available in the <b>&lt;output_files_var&gt;</b> and may be consumed by the caller for installation for example.   The
       <b>OUTPUT_DIR</b> specifies a relative path from the main <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> to the compiler-specific files. For example:

          write_compiler_detection_header(
            FILE climbingstats_compiler_detection.h
            PREFIX ClimbingStats
            OUTPUT_FILES_VAR support_files
            OUTPUT_DIR compilers
            COMPILERS GNU Clang MSVC Intel
            FEATURES cxx_variadic_templates
          )
          install(FILES
            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/climbingstats_compiler_detection.h
            DESTINATION include
          )
          install(FILES
            ${support_files}
            DESTINATION include/compilers
          )

       <b>VERSION</b>  may  be used to specify the API version to be generated.  Future versions of CMake may introduce
       alternative APIs.  A given API is selected by any <b>&lt;version&gt;</b> value greater than or equal to the version of
       CMake that introduced the given API and less than the version of CMake  that  introduced  its  succeeding
       API.   The  value  of  the  <u>CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION</u>  variable  is  used  if no explicit version is
       specified.  (As of CMake version 3.31.6 there is only one API version.)

       <b>PROLOG</b> may be specified as text content to write at the start of the header. <b>EPILOG</b> may be  specified  as
       text content to write at the end of the header

       At  least  one  <b>&lt;compiler&gt;</b> and one <b>&lt;feature&gt;</b> must be listed.  Compilers which are known to CMake, but not
       specified are detected and a preprocessor <b>#error</b> is generated for them.  A  preprocessor  macro  matching
       <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;_COMPILER_IS_&lt;compiler&gt;</b>  is  generated for each compiler known to CMake to contain the value <b>0</b> or
       <b>1</b>.

       Possible compiler identifiers are  documented  with  the  <u>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ID</u>  variable.   Available
       features  in  this version of CMake are listed in the <u>CMAKE_C_KNOWN_FEATURES</u> and <u>CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES</u>
       global properties.  See the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u> manual for information on compile features.

       Added in version 3.2: Added <b>MSVC</b> and <b>AppleClang</b> compiler support.

       Added in version 3.6: Added <b>Intel</b> compiler support.

       Changed in version 3.8: The <b>{c,cxx}_std_*</b> meta-features are ignored if requested.

       Added in version 3.8: <b>ALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILERS</b> and <b>ALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILER_VERSIONS</b>  cause  the  module  to
       generate  conditions  that treat unknown compilers as simply lacking all features.  Without these options
       the default behavior is to generate a <b>#error</b> for unknown compilers and versions.

       Added in version 3.12: <b>BARE_FEATURES</b> will define the compatibility macros with the  name  used  in  newer
       versions of the language standard, so the code can use the new feature name unconditionally.

   <b>Feature</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Macros</b>
       For  each  compiler, a preprocessor macro is generated matching <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;_COMPILER_IS_&lt;compiler&gt;</b> which has
       the content either <b>0</b> or <b>1</b>, depending on the compiler in use. Preprocessor  macros  for  compiler  version
       components  are  generated  matching  <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION_MAJOR</b> <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION_MINOR</b> and
       <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION_PATCH</b>  containing  decimal  values  for  the  corresponding  compiler   version
       components, if defined.

       A  preprocessor test is generated based on the compiler version denoting whether each feature is enabled.
       A preprocessor macro matching <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;_COMPILER_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b>, where <b>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</b> is  the  upper-case  <b>&lt;feature&gt;</b>
       name,  is  generated  to  contain  the value <b>0</b> or <b>1</b> depending on whether the compiler in use supports the
       feature:

          write_compiler_detection_header(
            FILE climbingstats_compiler_detection.h
            PREFIX ClimbingStats
            COMPILERS GNU Clang AppleClang MSVC Intel
            FEATURES cxx_variadic_templates
          )

          #if ClimbingStats_COMPILER_CXX_VARIADIC_TEMPLATES
          template&lt;typename... T&gt;
          void someInterface(T t...) { /* ... */ }
          #else
          // Compatibility versions
          template&lt;typename T1&gt;
          void someInterface(T1 t1) { /* ... */ }
          template&lt;typename T1, typename T2&gt;
          void someInterface(T1 t1, T2 t2) { /* ... */ }
          template&lt;typename T1, typename T2, typename T3&gt;
          void someInterface(T1 t1, T2 t2, T3 t3) { /* ... */ }
          #endif

   <b>Symbol</b> <b>Macros</b>
       Some additional symbol-defines are created for particular features  for  use  as  symbols  which  may  be
       conditionally defined empty:

          class MyClass ClimbingStats_FINAL
          {
              ClimbingStats_CONSTEXPR int someInterface() { return 42; }
          };

       The  <b>ClimbingStats_FINAL</b> macro will expand to <b>final</b> if the compiler (and its flags) support the <b>cxx_final</b>
       feature, and the <b>ClimbingStats_CONSTEXPR</b> macro will expand to <b>constexpr</b> if <b>cxx_constexpr</b> is supported.

       If <b>BARE_FEATURES</b> <b>cxx_final</b> was given as argument the <b>final</b> keyword will be  defined  for  old  compilers,
       too.

       The following features generate corresponding symbol defines and if they are available as <b>BARE_FEATURES</b>:

   <b>Compatibility</b> <b>Implementation</b> <b>Macros</b>
       Some  features  are  suitable for wrapping in a macro with a backward compatibility implementation if the
       compiler does not support the feature.

       When the <b>cxx_static_assert</b> feature is not provided by the compiler,  a  compatibility  implementation  is
       available  via  the  <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;_STATIC_ASSERT(COND)</b> and <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;_STATIC_ASSERT_MSG(COND,</b> <b>MSG)</b> function-like
       macros. The macros  expand  to  <b>static_assert</b>  where  that  compiler  feature  is  available,  and  to  a
       compatibility  implementation  otherwise.  In the first form, the condition is stringified in the message
       field of <b>static_assert</b>.  In the second  form,  the  message  <b>MSG</b>  is  passed  to  the  message  field  of
       <b>static_assert</b>, or ignored if using the backward compatibility implementation.

       The  <b>cxx_attribute_deprecated</b>  feature  provides a macro definition <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;_DEPRECATED</b>, which expands to
       either   the   standard   <b>[[deprecated]]</b>   attribute   or   a   compiler-specific   decorator   such   as
       <b>__attribute__((__deprecated__))</b> used by GNU compilers.

       The <b>cxx_alignas</b> feature provides a macro definition <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;_ALIGNAS</b> which expands to either the standard
       <b>alignas</b>  decorator  or  a  compiler-specific  decorator such as <b>__attribute__</b> <b>((__aligned__))</b> used by GNU
       compilers.

       The <b>cxx_alignof</b> feature provides a macro definition <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;_ALIGNOF</b> which expands to either the standard
       <b>alignof</b> decorator or a compiler-specific decorator such as <b>__alignof__</b> used by GNU compilers.

       A use-case which arises with such deprecation macros is the deprecation of an entire  library.   In  that
       case, all public API in the library may be decorated with the <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;_DEPRECATED</b> macro.  This results in
       very  noisy build output when building the library itself, so the macro may be may be defined to empty in
       that case when building the deprecated library:

          add_library(compat_support ${srcs})
          target_compile_definitions(compat_support
            PRIVATE
              CompatSupport_DEPRECATED=
          )

   <b>Example</b> <b>Usage</b>
       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This  section  was  migrated  from  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-compile-features.7.html">cmake-compile-features</a>(7)</u>  manual  since  it  relies  on  the
          <b>WriteCompilerDetectionHeader</b> module which is removed by policy <u>CMP0120</u>.

       Compile  features  may  be  preferred  if available, without creating a hard requirement.  For example, a
       library may provide alternative implementations depending on whether the  <b>cxx_variadic_templates</b>  feature
       is available:

          #if Foo_COMPILER_CXX_VARIADIC_TEMPLATES
          template&lt;int I, int... Is&gt;
          struct Interface;

          template&lt;int I&gt;
          struct Interface&lt;I&gt;
          {
            static int accumulate()
            {
              return I;
            }
          };

          template&lt;int I, int... Is&gt;
          struct Interface
          {
            static int accumulate()
            {
              return I + Interface&lt;Is...&gt;::accumulate();
            }
          };
          #else
          template&lt;int I1, int I2 = 0, int I3 = 0, int I4 = 0&gt;
          struct Interface
          {
            static int accumulate() { return I1 + I2 + I3 + I4; }
          };
          #endif

       Such an interface depends on using the correct preprocessor defines for the compiler features.  CMake can
       generate a header file containing such defines using the <u>WriteCompilerDetectionHeader</u> module.  The module
       contains  the <b>write_compiler_detection_header</b> function which accepts parameters to control the content of
       the generated header file:

          write_compiler_detection_header(
            FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/foo_compiler_detection.h"
            PREFIX Foo
            COMPILERS GNU
            FEATURES
              cxx_variadic_templates
          )

       Such a header file may be used internally in the source code of a project, and it may  be  installed  and
       used in the interface of library code.

       For each feature listed in <b>FEATURES</b>, a preprocessor definition is created in the header file, and defined
       to either <b>1</b> or <b>0</b>.

       Additionally, some features call for additional defines, such as the <b>cxx_final</b> and <b>cxx_override</b> features.
       Rather  than  being  used in <b>#ifdef</b> code, the <b>final</b> keyword is abstracted by a symbol which is defined to
       either <b>final</b>, a compiler-specific equivalent, or to  empty.   That  way,  C++  code  can  be  written  to
       unconditionally use the symbol, and compiler support determines what it is expanded to:

          struct Interface {
            virtual void Execute() = 0;
          };

          struct Concrete Foo_FINAL {
            void Execute() Foo_OVERRIDE;
          };

       In this case, <b>Foo_FINAL</b> will expand to <b>final</b> if the compiler supports the keyword, or to empty otherwise.

       In  this  use-case,  the project code may wish to enable a particular language standard if available from
       the compiler. The <u>CXX_STANDARD</u> target property may  be  set  to  the  desired  language  standard  for  a
       particular target, and the <u>CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD</u> variable may be set to influence all following targets:

          write_compiler_detection_header(
            FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/foo_compiler_detection.h"
            PREFIX Foo
            COMPILERS GNU
            FEATURES
              cxx_final cxx_override
          )

          # Includes foo_compiler_detection.h and uses the Foo_FINAL symbol
          # which will expand to 'final' if the compiler supports the requested
          # CXX_STANDARD.
          add_library(foo foo.cpp)
          set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 11)

          # Includes foo_compiler_detection.h and uses the Foo_FINAL symbol
          # which will expand to 'final' if the compiler supports the feature,
          # even though CXX_STANDARD is not set explicitly.  The requirement of
          # cxx_constexpr causes CMake to set CXX_STANDARD internally, which
          # affects the compile flags.
          add_library(foo_impl foo_impl.cpp)
          target_compile_features(foo_impl PRIVATE cxx_constexpr)

       The  <b>write_compiler_detection_header</b>  function  also  creates compatibility code for other features which
       have standard equivalents.  For example, the <b>cxx_static_assert</b> feature is emulated with  a  template  and
       abstracted via the <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;_STATIC_ASSERT</b> and <b>&lt;PREFIX&gt;_STATIC_ASSERT_MSG</b> function-macros.

   <b>Deprecated</b> <b>Find</b> <b>Modules</b>
   <b>FindBoost</b>
       Changed  in  version  3.30:  This  module  is  available  only if policy <u>CMP0167</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b>.  Port
       projects to upstream Boost's <b>BoostConfig.cmake</b> package configuration file, for which  <b>find_package(Boost)</b>
       now searches.

       Find Boost include dirs and libraries

       Use this module by invoking <u>find_package()</u> with the form:

          find_package(Boost
            [version] [EXACT]      # Minimum or EXACT version e.g. 1.67.0
            [REQUIRED]             # Fail with error if Boost is not found
            [COMPONENTS &lt;libs&gt;...] # Boost libraries by their canonical name
                                   # e.g. "date_time" for "libboost_date_time"
            [OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS &lt;libs&gt;...]
                                   # Optional Boost libraries by their canonical name)
            )                      # e.g. "date_time" for "libboost_date_time"

       This  module  finds  headers  and  requested  component  libraries  OR a CMake package configuration file
       provided by a "Boost CMake" build.  For the latter case skip to the <u>Boost</u> <u>CMake</u> section below.

       Added in version 3.7: <b>bzip2</b> and <b>zlib</b> components (Windows only).

       Added in version 3.11: The <b>OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS</b> option.

       Added in version 3.13: <b>stacktrace_*</b> components.

       Added in version 3.19: <b>bzip2</b> and <b>zlib</b> components on all platforms.

   <b>Result</b> <b>Variables</b>
       This module defines the following variables:

       <b>Boost_FOUND</b>
              True if headers and requested libraries were found.

       <b>Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              Boost include directories.

       <b>Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS</b>
              Link directories for Boost libraries.

       <b>Boost_LIBRARIES</b>
              Boost component libraries to be linked.

       <b>Boost_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_FOUND</b>
              True if component <b>&lt;COMPONENT&gt;</b> was found (<b>&lt;COMPONENT&gt;</b> name is upper-case).

       <b>Boost_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_LIBRARY</b>
              Libraries to link for component <b>&lt;COMPONENT&gt;</b> (may include  <u>target_link_libraries()</u>  debug/optimized
              keywords).

       <b>Boost_VERSION_MACRO</b>
              <b>BOOST_VERSION</b> value from <b>boost/version.hpp</b>.

       <b>Boost_VERSION_STRING</b>

       <b>Boost_VERSION</b>
              Boost version number in <b>X.Y.Z</b> format (same as <b>Boost_VERSION_STRING</b>).

              Changed  in  version  3.15:  In previous CMake versions, this variable used the raw version string
              from the Boost header (same as <b>Boost_VERSION_MACRO</b>).  See policy <u>CMP0093</u>.

       <b>Boost_LIB_VERSION</b>
              Version string appended to library filenames.

       <b>Boost_VERSION_MAJOR,</b> <b>Boost_MAJOR_VERSION</b>

       <b>Boost_VERSION_MINOR,</b> <b>Boost_MINOR_VERSION</b>
              Boost minor version number (<b>Y</b> in <b>X.Y.Z</b>).

       <b>Boost_VERSION_PATCH,</b> <b>Boost_SUBMINOR_VERSION</b>
              Boost subminor version number (<b>Z</b> in <b>X.Y.Z</b>).

       <b>Boost_VERSION_COUNT</b>
              Amount of version components (3).

       <b>Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS</b> <b>(Windows-specific)</b>
              Pass to <u>add_definitions()</u> to have diagnostic information about Boost's automatic linking displayed
              during compilation

       Added in version 3.15: The <b>Boost_VERSION_&lt;PART&gt;</b> variables.

   <b>Cache</b> <b>variables</b>
       Search results are saved persistently in CMake cache entries:

       <b>Boost_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
              Directory containing Boost headers.

       <b>Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_RELEASE</b>
              Directory containing release Boost libraries.

       <b>Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_DEBUG</b>
              Directory containing debug Boost libraries.

       <b>Boost_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_LIBRARY_DEBUG</b>
              Component <b>&lt;COMPONENT&gt;</b> library debug variant.

       <b>Boost_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_LIBRARY_RELEASE</b>
              Component <b>&lt;COMPONENT&gt;</b> library release variant.

       Added in version 3.3: Per-configuration variables <b>Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_RELEASE</b> and <b>Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_DEBUG</b>.

   <b>Hints</b>
       This module reads hints about search locations from variables:

       <b>BOOST_ROOT,</b> <b>BOOSTROOT</b>
              Preferred installation prefix.

       <b>BOOST_INCLUDEDIR</b>
              Preferred include directory e.g. <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/include</b>.

       <b>BOOST_LIBRARYDIR</b>
              Preferred library directory e.g. <b>&lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></b>.

       <b>Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS</b>
              Set to <b>ON</b> to disable searching in locations not specified by these hint variables. Default is <b>OFF</b>.

       <b>Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS</b>
              List of Boost versions not known to  this  module.   (Boost  install  locations  may  contain  the
              version).

       Users  may  set these hints or results as <b>CACHE</b> entries.  Projects should not read these entries directly
       but instead use the above result variables.  Note that some hint names start in  upper-case  <b>BOOST</b>.   One
       may specify these as environment variables if they are not specified as CMake variables or cache entries.

       This  module  first  searches  for  the  Boost  header  files  using  the above hint variables (excluding
       <b>BOOST_LIBRARYDIR</b>) and saves the result in <b>Boost_INCLUDE_DIR</b>.  Then it searches  for  requested  component
       libraries  using  the  above  hints  (excluding  <b>BOOST_INCLUDEDIR</b>  and  <b>Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS</b>), "lib"
       directories near <b>Boost_INCLUDE_DIR</b>, and the library name configuration  settings  below.   It  saves  the
       library  directories  in  <b>Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_DEBUG</b>  and  <b>Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_RELEASE</b>  and individual library
       locations in <b>Boost_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_LIBRARY_DEBUG</b> and  <b>Boost_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_LIBRARY_RELEASE</b>.   When  one  changes
       settings  used  by previous searches in the same build tree (excluding environment variables) this module
       discards previous search results affected by the changes and searches again.

   <b>Imported</b> <b>Targets</b>
       Added in version 3.5.

       This module defines the following <u>IMPORTED</u> targets:

       <b>Boost::boost</b>
              Target for header-only dependencies. (Boost include directory).

       <b>Boost::headers</b>
              Added in version 3.15: Alias for <b>Boost::boost</b>.

       <b>Boost::&lt;component&gt;</b>
              Target for  specific  component  dependency  (shared  or  static  library);  <b>&lt;component&gt;</b>  name  is
              lower-case.

       <b>Boost::diagnostic_definitions</b>
              Interface  target  to  enable  diagnostic  information  about  Boost's  automatic  linking  during
              compilation (adds <b>-DBOOST_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC</b>).

       <b>Boost::disable_autolinking</b>
              Interface target to disable automatic linking with MSVC (adds <b>-DBOOST_ALL_NO_LIB</b>).

       <b>Boost::dynamic_linking</b>
              Interface target to enable dynamic linking with MSVC (adds <b>-DBOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK</b>).

       Implicit dependencies such as <b>Boost::filesystem</b> requiring <b>Boost::system</b> will  be  automatically  detected
       and  satisfied,  even  if  system  is not specified when using <u>find_package()</u> and if <b>Boost::system</b> is not
       added to <u>target_link_libraries()</u>.  If using <b>Boost::thread</b>,  then  <b>Threads::Threads</b>  will  also  be  added
       automatically.

       It  is  important  to  note  that  the imported targets behave differently than variables created by this
       module: multiple calls to <u>find_package(Boost)</u> in the same directory  or  sub-directories  with  different
       options (e.g. static or shared) will not override the values of the targets created by the first call.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Variables</b>
       Boost libraries come in many variants encoded in their file name.  Users or projects may tell this module
       which variant to find by setting variables:

       <b>Boost_USE_DEBUG_LIBS</b>
              Added in version 3.10.

              Set to <b>ON</b> or <b>OFF</b> to specify whether to search and use the debug libraries.  Default is <b>ON</b>.

       <b>Boost_USE_RELEASE_LIBS</b>
              Added in version 3.10.

              Set to <b>ON</b> or <b>OFF</b> to specify whether to search and use the release libraries.  Default is <b>ON</b>.

       <b>Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED</b>
              Set to OFF to use the non-multithreaded libraries ("mt" tag). Default is <b>ON</b>.

       <b>Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS</b>
              Set to ON to force the use of the static libraries.  Default is <b>OFF</b>.

       <b>Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME</b>
              Set  to  <b>ON</b>  or  <b>OFF</b> to specify whether to use libraries linked statically to the C++ runtime ("s"
              tag).  Default is platform dependent.

       <b>Boost_USE_DEBUG_RUNTIME</b>
              Set to <b>ON</b> or <b>OFF</b> to specify whether to use libraries linked to the MS debug C++ runtime ("g" tag).
              Default is <b>ON</b>.

       <b>Boost_USE_DEBUG_PYTHON</b>
              Set to <b>ON</b> to use libraries compiled with a debug Python build ("y" tag).  Default is <b>OFF</b>.

       <b>Boost_USE_STLPORT</b>
              Set to <b>ON</b> to use libraries compiled with STLPort ("p" tag). Default is <b>OFF</b>.

       <b>Boost_USE_STLPORT_DEPRECATED_NATIVE_IOSTREAMS</b>
              Set to ON to use libraries compiled with STLPort deprecated "native iostreams" ("n" tag).  Default
              is <b>OFF</b>.

       <b>Boost_COMPILER</b>
              Set to the compiler-specific library suffix (e.g. <b>-gcc43</b>).  Default is auto-computed for  the  C++
              compiler in use.

              Changed  in  version 3.9: A list may be used if multiple compatible suffixes should be tested for,
              in decreasing order of preference.

       <b>Boost_LIB_PREFIX</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              Set to the platform-specific library name prefix (e.g. <b>lib</b>) used by Boost static  libs.   This  is
              needed only on platforms where CMake does not know the prefix by default.

       <b>Boost_ARCHITECTURE</b>
              Added in version 3.13.

              Set to the architecture-specific library suffix (e.g. <b>-x64</b>).  Default is auto-computed for the C++
              compiler in use.

       <b>Boost_THREADAPI</b>
              Suffix  for  <b>thread</b> component library name, such as <b>pthread</b> or <b>win32</b>.  Names with and without this
              suffix will both be tried.

       <b>Boost_NAMESPACE</b>
              Alternate  namespace  used  to  build  boost  with  e.g.  if  set  to  <b>myboost</b>,  will  search  for
              <b>myboost_thread</b> instead of <b>boost_thread</b>.

       Other variables one may set to control this module are:

       <b>Boost_DEBUG</b>
              Set to <b>ON</b> to enable debug output from <b>FindBoost</b>.  Please enable this before filing any bug report.

       <b>Boost_REALPATH</b>
              Set to <b>ON</b> to resolve symlinks for discovered libraries to assist with packaging.  For example, the
              "system"  component  library  may  be  resolved  to  <b>/usr/lib/libboost_system.so.1.67.0</b> instead of
              <b>/usr/lib/libboost_system.so</b>.  This does not affect linking and should not be  enabled  unless  the
              user needs this information.

       <b>Boost_LIBRARY_DIR</b>
              Default value for <b>Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_RELEASE</b> and <b>Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_DEBUG</b>.

       <b>Boost_NO_WARN_NEW_VERSIONS</b>
              Added in version 3.20.

              Set to <b>ON</b> to suppress the warning about unknown dependencies for new Boost versions.

       On  Visual  Studio  and  Borland  compilers  Boost  headers  request  automatic  linking to corresponding
       libraries.  This requires matching libraries to be linked explicitly or available  in  the  link  library
       search  path.   In this case setting <b>Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS</b> to <b>OFF</b> may not achieve dynamic linking.  Boost
       automatic linking typically requests static libraries with a few exceptions (such as <b>Boost.Python</b>).  Use:

          add_definitions(${Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS})

       to ask Boost to report information about automatic linking requests.

   <b>Examples</b>
       Find Boost headers only:

          find_package(Boost 1.36.0)
          if(Boost_FOUND)
            include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
            add_executable(foo foo.cc)
          endif()

       Find Boost libraries and use imported targets:

          find_package(Boost 1.56 REQUIRED COMPONENTS
                       date_time filesystem iostreams)
          add_executable(foo foo.cc)
          target_link_libraries(foo Boost::date_time Boost::filesystem
                                    Boost::iostreams)

       Find Boost Python 3.6 libraries and use imported targets:

          find_package(Boost 1.67 REQUIRED COMPONENTS
                       python36 numpy36)
          add_executable(foo foo.cc)
          target_link_libraries(foo Boost::python36 Boost::numpy36)

       Find Boost headers and some <u>static</u> (release only) libraries:

          set(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS        ON)  # only find static libs
          set(Boost_USE_DEBUG_LIBS        OFF)  # ignore debug libs and
          set(Boost_USE_RELEASE_LIBS       ON)  # only find release libs
          set(Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED      ON)
          set(Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME    OFF)
          find_package(Boost 1.66.0 COMPONENTS date_time filesystem system ...)
          if(Boost_FOUND)
            include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
            add_executable(foo foo.cc)
            target_link_libraries(foo ${Boost_LIBRARIES})
          endif()

   <b>Boost</b> <b>CMake</b>
       If Boost was built using the  boost-cmake  project  or  from  Boost  1.70.0  on  it  provides  a  package
       configuration  file  for  use  with  find_package's  config  mode.   This  module  looks  for the package
       configuration file called <b>BoostConfig.cmake</b> or <b>boost-config.cmake</b> and stores the result  in  <b>CACHE</b>  entry
       <b>Boost_DIR</b>.   If  found,  the package configuration file is loaded and this module returns with no further
       action.  See documentation of the Boost CMake package configuration for details on what it provides.

       Set <b>Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE</b> to <b>ON</b>, to disable the search for boost-cmake.

   <b>FindCUDA</b>
       Changed in version 3.27: This module is available only if  policy  <u>CMP0146</u>  is  not  set  to  <b>NEW</b>.   Port
       projects to CMake's first-class <b>CUDA</b> language support.

       Deprecated since version 3.10: Do not use this module in new code.

       It is no longer necessary to use this module or call <b>find_package(CUDA)</b> for compiling CUDA code. Instead,
       list  <b>CUDA</b>  among  the  languages  named  in  the  top-level  call  to the <u>project()</u> command, or call the
       <u>enable_language()</u> command with <b>CUDA</b>.  Then one can add CUDA (<b>.cu</b>) sources directly to targets similar  to
       other languages.

       Added  in  version  3.17:  To  find  and use the CUDA toolkit libraries manually, use the <u>FindCUDAToolkit</u>
       module instead.  It works regardless of the <b>CUDA</b> language being enabled.

   <b>Documentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deprecated</b> <b>Usage</b>
       Tools for building CUDA C files: libraries and build dependencies.

       This script locates the NVIDIA CUDA C tools.  It should work on Linux, Windows, and macOS and  should  be
       reasonably up to date with CUDA C releases.

       Added in version 3.19: QNX support.

       This  script  makes  use  of  the  standard  <u>find_package()</u>  arguments  of <b>&lt;VERSION&gt;</b>, <b>REQUIRED</b> and <b>QUIET</b>.
       <b>CUDA_FOUND</b> will report if an acceptable version of CUDA was found.

       The script will prompt the user to specify <b>CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR</b> if the prefix cannot  be  determined  by
       the  location of nvcc in the system path and <b>REQUIRED</b> is specified to <u>find_package()</u>.  To use a different
       installed version of the toolkit set the environment variable <b>CUDA_BIN_PATH</b> before  running  cmake  (e.g.
       <b>CUDA_BIN_PATH=/usr/local/cuda1.0</b>  instead  of  the  default <b>/usr/local/cuda</b>) or set <b>CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR</b>
       after configuring.  If you change the value of <b>CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR</b>, various components that  depend  on
       the path will be relocated.

       It  might  be  necessary  to  set  <b>CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR</b>  manually on certain platforms, or to use a CUDA
       runtime not installed in the default location.  In newer versions of the  toolkit  the  CUDA  library  is
       included  with  the graphics driver -- be sure that the driver version matches what is needed by the CUDA
       runtime version.

   <b>Input</b> <b>Variables</b>
       The following variables affect the behavior of the macros in the script (in  alphabetical  order).   Note
       that  any  of  these  flags  can  be  changed  multiple  times  in  the  same  directory  before  calling
       <b>cuda_add_executable()</b>,  <b>cuda_add_library()</b>,  <b>cuda_compile()</b>,  <b>cuda_compile_ptx()</b>,  <b>cuda_compile_fatbin()</b>,
       <b>cuda_compile_cubin()</b> or <b>cuda_wrap_srcs()</b>:

       <b>CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE</b> <b>(Default:</b> <b>host</b> <b>bit</b> <b>size)</b>
              Set  to  <b>ON</b>  to compile for 64 bit device code, OFF for 32 bit device code.  Note that making this
              different from the host code when generating object or C files from CUDA  code  just  won't  work,
              because  size_t gets defined by nvcc in the generated source.  If you compile to PTX and then load
              the file yourself, you can mix bit sizes between device and host.

       <b>CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE</b> <b>(Default:</b> <b>ON)</b>
              Set to <b>ON</b> if you want the custom build rule to be attached to the source file  in  Visual  Studio.
              Turn OFF if you add the same cuda file to multiple targets.

              This allows the user to build the target from the CUDA file; however, bad things can happen if the
              CUDA source file is added to multiple targets.  When performing parallel builds it is possible for
              the  custom  build  command to be run more than once and in parallel causing cryptic build errors.
              VS runs the rules for every source file in the target, and a source can  have  only  one  rule  no
              matter  how  many  projects  it  is  added  to.   When  the rule is run from multiple targets race
              conditions can occur on the generated file.  Eventually everything will get built, but if the user
              is unaware of this behavior, there may be confusion.  It would be nice if this script could detect
              the reuse of source files across multiple targets and turn the option off for  the  user,  but  no
              good solution could be found.

       <b>CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN</b> <b>(Default:</b> <b>OFF)</b>
              Set  to  <b>ON</b> to enable and extra compilation pass with the <b>-cubin</b> option in Device mode. The output
              is parsed and register, shared memory usage is printed during build.

       <b>CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION</b> <b>(Default:</b> <b>OFF</b> <b>for</b> <b>device</b> <b>mode)</b>
              Set to <b>ON</b> for Emulation mode. <b>-D_DEVICEEMU</b> is defined for CUDA C files  when  <b>CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION</b>
              is <b>TRUE</b>.

       <b>CUDA_LINK_LIBRARIES_KEYWORD</b> <b>(Default:</b> <b>"")</b>
              Added in version 3.9.

              The  <b>&lt;PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE&gt;</b>  keyword  to  use  for internal <u>target_link_libraries()</u> calls. The
              default is to use no keyword which uses the old "plain" form of <u>target_link_libraries()</u>. Note that
              is matters because whatever is used inside the <b>FindCUDA</b> module must also be used outside - the two
              forms of <u>target_link_libraries()</u> cannot be mixed.

       <b>CUDA_GENERATED_OUTPUT_DIR</b> <b>(Default:</b> <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u><b>)</b>
              Set to the path you wish to have the generated files placed.  If it is blank output files will  be
              placed   in   <u>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</u>.    Intermediate   files   will   always   be   placed   in
              <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR/CMakeFiles</b>.

       <b>CUDA_HOST_COMPILATION_CPP</b> <b>(Default:</b> <b>ON)</b>
              Set to <b>OFF</b> for C compilation of host code.

       <b>CUDA_HOST_COMPILER</b> <b>(Default:</b> <b>CMAKE_C_COMPILER)</b>
              Set the host compiler to be used by nvcc.  Ignored  if  <b>-ccbin</b>  or  <b>--compiler-bindir</b>  is  already
              present  in the <b>CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS</b> or <b>CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b> variables.  For Visual Studio targets,
              the host compiler is constructed with one or more visual studio macros  such  as  <b>$(VCInstallDir)</b>,
              that expands out to the path when the command is run from within VS.

              Added  in  version  3.13:  If  the  <u>CUDAHOSTCXX</u> environment variable is set it will be used as the
              default.

       <b>CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS,</b> <b>CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
              Additional NVCC command line arguments.  NOTE: multiple arguments  must  be  semi-colon  delimited
              (e.g. <b>--compiler-options;-Wall</b>)

              Added in version 3.6: Contents of these variables may use <u>generator</u> <u>expressions</u>.

       <b>CUDA_PROPAGATE_HOST_FLAGS</b> <b>(Default:</b> <b>ON)</b>
              Set  to  <b>ON</b>  to propagate <u>CMAKE_{C,CXX}_FLAGS</u> and their configuration dependent counterparts (e.g.
              <b>CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG</b>) automatically to the host compiler  through  nvcc's  <b>-Xcompiler</b>  flag.   This
              helps  make  the generated host code match the rest of the system better.  Sometimes certain flags
              give nvcc problems, and this will help you turn the flag propagation off.  This  does  not  affect
              the  flags  supplied  directly  to  nvcc via <b>CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS</b> or through the <b>OPTION</b> flags specified
              through <b>cuda_add_library()</b>, <b>cuda_add_executable()</b>, or <b>cuda_wrap_srcs()</b>.   Flags  used  for  shared
              library compilation are not affected by this flag.

       <b>CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION</b> <b>(Default:</b> <b>OFF)</b>
              If  set this will enable separable compilation for all CUDA runtime object files.  If used outside
              of  <b>cuda_add_executable()</b>  and  <b>cuda_add_library()</b>  (e.g.  calling   <b>cuda_wrap_srcs()</b>   directly),
              <b>cuda_compute_separable_compilation_object_file_name()</b>                                          and
              <b>cuda_link_separable_compilation_objects()</b> should be called.

       <b>CUDA_SOURCE_PROPERTY_FORMAT</b>
              Added in version 3.3.

              If this source file property is set, it can override  the  format  specified  to  <b>cuda_wrap_srcs()</b>
              (<b>OBJ</b>,  <b>PTX</b>,  <b>CUBIN</b>, or <b>FATBIN</b>).  If an input source file is not a <b>.cu</b> file, setting this file will
              cause it to be treated as a <b>.cu</b> file. See documentation for set_source_files_properties on how  to
              set this property.

       <b>CUDA_USE_STATIC_CUDA_RUNTIME</b> <b>(Default:</b> <b>ON)</b>
              Added in version 3.3.

              When  enabled  the  static version of the CUDA runtime library will be used in <b>CUDA_LIBRARIES</b>.  If
              the version of CUDA configured doesn't support this option, then it will be silently disabled.

       <b>CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD</b> <b>(Default:</b> <b>OFF)</b>
              Set to <b>ON</b> to see all the commands used when  building  the  CUDA  file.   When  using  a  Makefile
              generator  the  value  defaults  to  <b>VERBOSE</b>  (run <b>make</b> <b>VERBOSE=1</b> to see output), although setting
              <b>CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD</b> to <b>ON</b> will always print the output.

   <b>Commands</b>
       The script creates the following functions and macros (in alphabetical order):

          cuda_add_cufft_to_target(&lt;cuda_target&gt;)

       Adds the cufft library to the target (can be any target).  Handles whether you are in emulation  mode  or
       not.

          cuda_add_cublas_to_target(&lt;cuda_target&gt;)

       Adds  the cublas library to the target (can be any target).  Handles whether you are in emulation mode or
       not.

          cuda_add_executable(&lt;cuda_target&gt; &lt;file&gt;...
                              [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...])

       Creates an executable <b>&lt;cuda_target&gt;</b> which is made up of the files specified.  All of the non CUDA C files
       are compiled using the standard build rules specified by CMake and the CUDA files are compiled to  object
       files  using  nvcc  and  the  host  compiler.   In  addition  <b>CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS</b> is added automatically to
       <u>include_directories()</u>.  Some standard CMake target calls can be used on the  target  after  calling  this
       macro  (e.g.  <u>set_target_properties()</u>  and  <u>target_link_libraries()</u>),  but setting properties that adjust
       compilation flags will not affect code compiled by nvcc.  Such flags should be  modified  before  calling
       <b>cuda_add_executable()</b>, <b>cuda_add_library()</b> or <b>cuda_wrap_srcs()</b>.

          cuda_add_library(&lt;cuda_target&gt; &lt;file&gt;...
                           [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...])

       Same as <b>cuda_add_executable()</b> except that a library is created.

          cuda_build_clean_target()

       Creates  a  convenience  target  that  deletes all the dependency files generated.  You should make clean
       after running this target to ensure the dependency files get regenerated.

          cuda_compile(&lt;generated_files&gt; &lt;file&gt;... [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]
                       [OPTIONS ...])

       Returns a list of generated files  from  the  input  source  files  to  be  used  with  <u>add_library()</u>  or
       <u>add_executable()</u>.

          cuda_compile_ptx(&lt;generated_files&gt; &lt;file&gt;... [OPTIONS ...])

       Returns a list of <b>PTX</b> files generated from the input source files.

          cuda_compile_fatbin(&lt;generated_files&gt; &lt;file&gt;... [OPTIONS ...])

       Added in version 3.1.

       Returns a list of <b>FATBIN</b> files generated from the input source files.

          cuda_compile_cubin(&lt;generated_files&gt; &lt;file&gt;... [OPTIONS ...])

       Added in version 3.1.

       Returns a list of <b>CUBIN</b> files generated from the input source files.

          cuda_compute_separable_compilation_object_file_name(&lt;output_file_var&gt;
                                                              &lt;cuda_target&gt;
                                                              &lt;object_files&gt;)

       Compute  the  name  of  the  intermediate  link  file  used for separable compilation.  This file name is
       typically passed into <b>CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS</b>.   output_file_var  is  produced  based  on
       cuda_target the list of objects files that need separable compilation as specified by <b>&lt;object_files&gt;</b>.  If
       the  <b>&lt;object_files&gt;</b>  list  is  empty,  then  <b>&lt;output_file_var&gt;</b>  will  be  empty.  This function is called
       automatically for <b>cuda_add_library()</b> and <b>cuda_add_executable()</b>.  Note that this is a function and  not  a
       macro.

          cuda_include_directories(path0 path1 ...)

       Sets  the  directories that should be passed to nvcc (e.g. <b>nvcc</b> <b>-Ipath0</b> <b>-Ipath1</b> <b>...</b>). These paths usually
       contain other <b>.cu</b> files.

          cuda_link_separable_compilation_objects(&lt;output_file_var&gt; &lt;cuda_target&gt;
                                                  &lt;nvcc_flags&gt; &lt;object_files&gt;)

       Generates the link object required by separable compilation from the given object files.  This is  called
       automatically  for  <b>cuda_add_executable()</b>  and  <b>cuda_add_library()</b>, but can be called manually when using
       <b>cuda_wrap_srcs()</b> directly.  When called from <b>cuda_add_library()</b> or <b>cuda_add_executable()</b> the <b>&lt;nvcc_flags&gt;</b>
       passed in are the same as the flags passed in via  the  <b>OPTIONS</b>  argument.   The  only  nvcc  flag  added
       automatically  is the bitness flag as specified by <b>CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE</b>.  Note that this is a function
       instead of a macro.

          cuda_select_nvcc_arch_flags(&lt;out_variable&gt; [&lt;target_CUDA_architecture&gt; ...])

       Selects GPU arch flags for nvcc based on <b>target_CUDA_architecture</b>.

       Values for <b>target_CUDA_architecture</b>:

       • <b>Auto</b>: detects local machine GPU compute arch at runtime.

       • <b>Common</b> and <b>All</b>: cover common and entire subsets of architectures.

       • <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>: one of <b>Fermi</b>, <b>Kepler</b>, <b>Maxwell</b>, <b>Kepler+Tegra</b>, <b>Kepler+Tesla</b>, <b>Maxwell+Tegra</b>, <b>Pascal</b>.

       • <b>&lt;ver&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;ver&gt;(&lt;ver&gt;)</b>, <b>&lt;ver&gt;+PTX</b>, where <b>&lt;ver&gt;</b> is one of <b>2.0</b>, <b>2.1</b>, <b>3.0</b>, <b>3.2</b>, <b>3.5</b>, <b>3.7</b>, <b>5.0</b>, <b>5.2</b>, <b>5.3</b>, <b>6.0</b>,
         <b>6.2</b>.

       Returns  list  of  flags  to  be  added  to  <b>CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS</b>  in  <b>&lt;out_variable&gt;</b>.    Additionally,   sets
       <b>&lt;out_variable&gt;_readable</b> to the resulting numeric list.

       Example:

          cuda_select_nvcc_arch_flags(ARCH_FLAGS 3.0 3.5+PTX 5.2(5.0) Maxwell)
          list(APPEND CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS ${ARCH_FLAGS})

       More  info  on  CUDA  architectures:  <u>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA</u>.   Note  that this is a function
       instead of a macro.

          cuda_wrap_srcs(&lt;cuda_target&gt; &lt;format&gt; &lt;generated_files&gt; &lt;file&gt;...
                         [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [OPTIONS ...])

       This is where all the magic  happens.   <b>cuda_add_executable()</b>,  <b>cuda_add_library()</b>,  <b>cuda_compile()</b>,  and
       <b>cuda_compile_ptx()</b> all call this function under the hood.

       Given  the  list  of  files  <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b>  this  macro generates custom commands that generate either PTX or
       linkable objects (use <b>PTX</b> or <b>OBJ</b> for the <b>&lt;format&gt;</b> argument to switch).  Files that don't end with <b>.cu</b>  or
       have the <b>HEADER_FILE_ONLY</b> property are ignored.

       The  arguments  passed  in  after  <b>OPTIONS</b>  are extra command line options to give to nvcc.  You can also
       specify per configuration options by specifying the name of the configuration followed  by  the  options.
       General  options  must  precede  configuration  specific  options.   Not  all  configurations  need to be
       specified, only the ones provided will be used.  For example:

          cuda_add_executable(...
            OPTIONS -DFLAG=2 "-DFLAG_OTHER=space in flag"
            DEBUG -g
            RELEASE --use_fast_math
            RELWITHDEBINFO --use_fast_math;-g
            MINSIZEREL --use_fast_math)

       For certain configurations (namely VS generating object files with <b>CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE</b>
       set to <b>ON</b>), no generated file will be produced for the given cuda file.  This is because when you add the
       cuda file to Visual Studio it knows that this file produces an object file and will link in the resulting
       object file automatically.

       This script will also generate a separate cmake script that is used at build time to invoke  nvcc.   This
       is for several reasons:

       • nvcc  can  return negative numbers as return values which confuses Visual Studio into thinking that the
         command succeeded.  The script now checks the error codes and produces errors when there was a problem.

       • nvcc has been known to not delete incomplete results when it encounters problems.  This confuses  build
         systems  into  thinking  the target was generated when in fact an unusable file exists.  The script now
         deletes the output files if there was an error.

       • By putting all the options that affect the build into a file and then make the build rule dependent  on
         the file, the output files will be regenerated when the options change.

       This  script  also  looks at optional arguments <b>STATIC</b>, <b>SHARED</b>, or <b>MODULE</b> to determine when to target the
       object compilation for a shared library.  <u>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</u> is ignored in  <b>cuda_wrap_srcs()</b>,  but  it  is
       respected  in  <b>cuda_add_library()</b>.  On some systems special flags are added for building objects intended
       for shared libraries.  A preprocessor macro, <b>&lt;target_name&gt;_EXPORTS</b>  is  defined  when  a  shared  library
       compilation is detected.

       Flags passed into add_definitions with <b>-D</b> or <b>/D</b> are passed along to nvcc.

   <b>Result</b> <b>Variables</b>
       The script defines the following variables:

       <b>CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR</b>
              The major version of cuda as reported by nvcc.

       <b>CUDA_VERSION_MINOR</b>
              The minor version.

       <b>CUDA_VERSION,</b> <b>CUDA_VERSION_STRING</b>
              Full version in the <b>X.Y</b> format.

       <b>CUDA_HAS_FP16</b>
              Added in version 3.6: Whether a short float (<b>float16</b>, <b>fp16</b>) is supported.

       <b>CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR</b>
              Path to the CUDA Toolkit (defined if not set).

       <b>CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR</b>
              Path  to  the CUDA SDK.  Use this to find files in the SDK.  This script will not directly support
              finding specific libraries or headers, as that isn't supported by NVIDIA.  If you want  to  change
              libraries when the path changes see the <b>FindCUDA.cmake</b> script for an example of how to clear these
              variables.   There  are  also  examples  of  how to use the <b>CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR</b> to locate headers or
              libraries, if you so choose (at your own risk).

       <b>CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS</b>
              Include  directory  for  cuda  headers.   Added  automatically   for   <b>cuda_add_executable()</b>   and
              <b>cuda_add_library()</b>.

       <b>CUDA_LIBRARIES</b>
              Cuda RT library.

   <b>FindDart</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.27: This module is available only if policy <u>CMP0145</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b>.

       Find DART

       This module looks for the dart testing software and sets DART_ROOT to point to where it found it.

   <b>FindITK</b>
       This module no longer exists.

       This  module  existed  in  versions  of  CMake  prior  to  3.1,  but  became  only  a thin wrapper around
       <b>find_package(ITK</b> <b>NO_MODULE)</b> to provide compatibility for projects using long-outdated  conventions.   Now
       <b>find_package(ITK)</b> will search for <b>ITKConfig.cmake</b> directly.

   <b>FindPythonInterp</b>
       Changed in version 3.27: This module is available only if policy <u>CMP0148</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b>.

       Deprecated since version 3.12: Use <u>FindPython3</u>, <u>FindPython2</u> or <u>FindPython</u> instead.

       Find python interpreter

       This module finds if Python interpreter is installed and determines where the executables are.  This code
       sets the following variables:

          PYTHONINTERP_FOUND         - Was the Python executable found
          PYTHON_EXECUTABLE          - path to the Python interpreter

          PYTHON_VERSION_STRING      - Python version found e.g. 2.5.2
          PYTHON_VERSION_MAJOR       - Python major version found e.g. 2
          PYTHON_VERSION_MINOR       - Python minor version found e.g. 5
          PYTHON_VERSION_PATCH       - Python patch version found e.g. 2

       The  Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS  variable can be used to specify a list of version numbers that should be
       taken  into  account  when  searching  for  Python.   You  need  to  set  this  variable  before  calling
       find_package(PythonInterp).

       If  calling both <b>find_package(PythonInterp)</b> and <b>find_package(PythonLibs)</b>, call <b>find_package(PythonInterp)</b>
       first  to  get  the  currently  active  Python  version  by  default  with  a   consistent   version   of
       PYTHON_LIBRARIES.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          A  call  to  <b>find_package(PythonInterp</b> <b>${V})</b> for python version <b>V</b> may find a <b>python</b> executable with no
          version suffix.  In this case no attempt is made to avoid python executables from other versions.  Use
          <u>FindPython3</u>, <u>FindPython2</u> or <u>FindPython</u> instead.

   <b>FindPythonLibs</b>
       Changed in version 3.27: This module is available only if policy <u>CMP0148</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b>.

       Deprecated since version 3.12: Use <u>FindPython3</u>, <u>FindPython2</u> or <u>FindPython</u> instead.

       Find python libraries

       This module finds if Python is installed and determines where the include files and  libraries  are.   It
       also determines what the name of the library is.  This code sets the following variables:

          PYTHONLIBS_FOUND           - have the Python libs been found
          PYTHON_LIBRARIES           - path to the python library
          PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH        - path to where Python.h is found (deprecated)
          PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS        - path to where Python.h is found
          PYTHON_DEBUG_LIBRARIES     - path to the debug library (deprecated)
          PYTHONLIBS_VERSION_STRING  - version of the Python libs found (since CMake 2.8.8)

       The  Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS  variable can be used to specify a list of version numbers that should be
       taken  into  account  when  searching  for  Python.   You  need  to  set  this  variable  before  calling
       find_package(PythonLibs).

       If  you'd  like  to  specify  the  installation  of  Python to use, you should modify the following cache
       variables:

          PYTHON_LIBRARY             - path to the python library
          PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR         - path to where Python.h is found

       If calling both <b>find_package(PythonInterp)</b> and <b>find_package(PythonLibs)</b>, call  <b>find_package(PythonInterp)</b>
       first   to   get   the  currently  active  Python  version  by  default  with  a  consistent  version  of
       PYTHON_LIBRARIES.

   <b>FindQt</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.14: This module is available only if policy <u>CMP0084</u> is not set to <b>NEW</b>.

       Searches for all installed versions of Qt3 or Qt4.

       This module cannot handle Qt5 or any later versions.  For those, see <u><a href="../man7/cmake-qt.7.html">cmake-qt</a>(7)</u>.

       This module should only be used if your project can work with multiple  versions  of  Qt.   If  not,  you
       should  just  directly use FindQt4 or FindQt3.  If multiple versions of Qt are found on the machine, then
       The user must set the option DESIRED_QT_VERSION to the version they want to use.  If only one version  of
       qt  is  found on the machine, then the DESIRED_QT_VERSION is set to that version and the matching FindQt3
       or FindQt4 module is included.  Once the user sets DESIRED_QT_VERSION, then the FindQt3 or FindQt4 module
       is included.

          QT_REQUIRED if this is set to TRUE then if CMake can
                      not find Qt4 or Qt3 an error is raised
                      and a message is sent to the user.

          DESIRED_QT_VERSION OPTION is created
          QT4_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if qt4 is found.
          QT3_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if qt3 is found.

   <b>FindUnixCommands</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.26: Use <u>${CMAKE_COMMAND}</u> <u>-E</u> subcommands instead.

       Find Unix commands, including the ones from Cygwin

       This module looks for the Unix commands <b>bash</b>, <b>cp</b>, <b>gzip</b>, <b>mv</b>, <b>rm</b>, and <b>tar</b> and  stores  the  result  in  the
       variables <b>BASH</b>, <b>CP</b>, <b>GZIP</b>, <b>MV</b>, <b>RM</b>, and <b>TAR</b>.

   <b>FindVTK</b>
       This module no longer exists.

       This  module  existed  in  versions  of  CMake  prior  to  3.1,  but  became  only  a thin wrapper around
       <b>find_package(VTK</b> <b>NO_MODULE)</b> to provide compatibility for projects using long-outdated  conventions.   Now
       <b>find_package(VTK)</b> will search for <b>VTKConfig.cmake</b> directly.

   <b>FindwxWindows</b>
       Deprecated since version 3.0: Replaced by <u>FindwxWidgets</u>.

       Find wxWindows (wxWidgets) installation

       This  module  finds  if  wxWindows/wxWidgets  is  installed  and  determines  where the include files and
       libraries are.  It also determines what the name of  the  library  is.   This  code  sets  the  following
       variables:

          WXWINDOWS_FOUND     = system has WxWindows
          WXWINDOWS_LIBRARIES = path to the wxWindows libraries
                                on Unix/Linux with additional
                                linker flags from
                                "wx-config --libs"
          CMAKE_WXWINDOWS_CXX_FLAGS  = Compiler flags for wxWindows,
                                       essentially "`wx-config --cxxflags`"
                                       on Linux
          WXWINDOWS_INCLUDE_DIR      = where to find "wx/wx.h" and "wx/setup.h"
          WXWINDOWS_LINK_DIRECTORIES = link directories, useful for rpath on
                                        Unix
          WXWINDOWS_DEFINITIONS      = extra defines

       OPTIONS If you need OpenGL support please

          set(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1)

       in your CMakeLists.txt <u>before</u> you include this file.

          HAVE_ISYSTEM      - true required to replace -I by -isystem on g++

       For    convenience    include    Use_wxWindows.cmake    in    your    project's    CMakeLists.txt   using
       include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/Use_wxWindows.cmake).

       USAGE

          set(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1)
          find_package(wxWindows)

       NOTES wxWidgets 2.6.x is supported for monolithic builds e.g.  compiled in wx/build/msw dir as:

          nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=debug SHARED=0 USE_OPENGL=1 MONOLITHIC=1

       DEPRECATED

          CMAKE_WX_CAN_COMPILE
