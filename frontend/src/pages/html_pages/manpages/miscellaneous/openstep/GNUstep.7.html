</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       GNUstep - A free implementation of the OpenStep standard

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>GNUstep</b>  provides  an  Object-Oriented  application  development  framework and toolset for use on a wide
       variety of computer platforms.  <b>GNUstep</b> is based on the original OpenStep specification provided by NeXT,
       Inc. (now Apple and called Cocoa).

       <b>GNUstep</b> is written in Objective-C, an object-oriented superset of the C programming language, similar  to
       SmallTalk. However there exist a number of bridges and interfaces to develop <b>GNUstep</b> programs using other
       languages like JAVA or Ruby.

       The <b>GNUstep</b> core system consists of the following parts, which are jointly referred to as <u>gnustep-core</u> :

       <u>gnustep-make</u>
              A  set  of  scripts  and  makefiles  that  heavily  ease  the creation and maintenance of software
              projects.

       <u>gnustep-base</u>
              The FoundationKit libraries for non-GUI tools providing everything from string and array  classes,
              filemanager classes to distributed objects.

       <u>gnustep-gui</u>
              The  ApplicationKit  containing  widgets, workspace classes and means for applications to interact
              with the user. This is the frontend of <b>GNUstep</b>'s GUI part.

       <u>gnustep-back</u>
              This is the backend of <b>GNUstep</b>'s GUI part which does the actual rendering and event  handling.  It
              acts  as a layer between gnustep-gui and the operating/drawing system. Backends exist for X11 (one
              using cairo, one using libart, one using xlib drawing) and win32.

       Apart from the above, there exist a number of addon libraries related to GNUstep, like <b>Renaissance</b>  which
       allows developers to specify an application's user interface in xml. For database access, there is <b>GDL2</b> -
       the GNUstep Database Library. Please refer to the <b>GNUstep</b> website for more information.

       <b>GNUstep</b>  per  default  is  self-contained. That means that all <b>GNUstep</b> applications, tools, libraries and
       add-ons are installed into the <b>GNUstep</b> directory hierarchy. However as of <u>gnustep-make-2.0.0</u> it  is  also
       possible to install everything in compliance with other filesystem hierarchies. See the <u>FilesystemLayouts</u>
       directory in the source package of <u>gnustep-make</u> for more information.

       There  are  four  domains  which are searched for files: the System domain, which should only contain the
       core system files, the Local domain which stores all that has later been installed  on  the  system,  the
       Network  domain  which  should be used for importing data from a remote system, and the User domain which
       resides in the user's home directory (mostly <u><a href="file:~/GNUstep">~/GNUstep</a></u>).

       A complete description of the default <b>GNUstep</b> layout can be found in the <u>filesystem.pdf</u>.

   <b>TOOLS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>APPLICATIONS</b>
       In the world of GNUstep the term <u>tool</u> refers to command line  programs  whereas  <u>applications</u>  are  fully
       fledged GUI programs.  Naturally, <u>tools</u> reside in the domains' Tools folder, <u>applications</u> can be found in
       the domains' Applications folder.

       Applications are either launched using the <b>openapp</b> command or from the Workspace.

   <b>SERVICES</b>
       In <b>GNUstep</b> applications globally offer functionality to other applications through <u>services</u>.  They can be
       reached  through  the  Services  menu entry in an application's main menu. Apart from <u>services</u> offered by
       applications, there may be programs whose sole purpose is the offering of services. They can be found  in
       the domains' Libary/Services folders.

       The  <b>make_services</b>  tool  makes  sure  the services are known to other applications when a application is
       newly installed.

   <b>BUNDLES</b>
       A bundle is a collection of resources making up a discrete package for use.  There  are  currently  three
       types of bundles: applications, frameworks and loadable bundles.

       A  loadable  bundle  is  a  kind of plug-in. There are two types of loadable bundles, namely plug-ins and
       palettes. The plug-in is normally referred to as a bundle, which can make it a bit confusing.  A  plug-in
       is  a bundle that can be loaded by an application to provide additional functionality, while a palette is
       a plug-in for <b>GORM</b>, the interface builder. A palette is used to  extend  <b>GORM</b>  with  custom  UI  objects.
       Palettes have a <u>.palette</u> extension.

   <b>THE</b> <b>WORKSPACE</b>
       The  central place of the user interface is the <u>Workspace</u> or <u>Workspace</u> <u>Manager</u> which acts as an interface
       between the user and parts of the system like files, processes, etc. The GWorkspace application  provides
       this functionality in GNUstep. See the GWorkspace website for more details.

   <b>DEVELOPER</b> <b>APPLICATIONS</b>
       What would a development environment be without the applications to create applications? The applications
       provided by GNUstep for Rapid Application Development are:

       GORM   <b>GORM</b>  is  the  interface modeler. With <b>GORM</b> you can quickly create the graphical interface of your
              application.

       Project Center
              <b>Project</b> <b>Center</b> is the program where  you  can  develop  your  program.  It  offers  you  automatic
              generation of <u>GNUmakefiles</u> , project maintenance and of course a code editor.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>GNUstep</b>  was at first a collaboration of two projects that wanted to create a single <b>GNUstep</b> project that
       complied to the OpenStep specification provided by NeXT Computer, Inc. and SunSoft, Inc.  Development  of
       this  joint  effort  started  around  1993-1994.  For a more detailed history description see the GNUstep
       Documentation Library referenced in the <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b> section.

       GNUstep   is   developed   and   maintained   by   a    large    number    of    people.    Please    see
       &lt;<a href="http://www.gnustep.org/developers/whoiswho.html">http://www.gnustep.org/developers/whoiswho.html</a>&gt; for a list.

       In  December  2007  it  was  expanded  by  Dennis  Leeuw &lt;<a href="mailto:dleeuw@made-it.com">dleeuw@made-it.com</a>&gt; and made to comply with the
       gnustep-make-2.0.x releases.
