</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       poll.h — definitions for the poll() function

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/poll.h">poll.h</a>&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>&lt;poll.h&gt;</u>  header  shall  define  the  <b>pollfd</b>  structure,  which shall include at least the following
       members:

           int    fd       The following descriptor being polled.
           short  events   The input event flags (see below).
           short  revents  The output event flags (see below).

       The <u>&lt;poll.h&gt;</u> header shall define the following type through <b>typedef</b>:

       <b>nfds_t</b>        An unsigned integer type used for the number of file descriptors.

       The implementation shall support one or more programming environments in which the width of <b>nfds_t</b> is  no
       greater  than  the width of type <b>long</b>.  The names of these programming environments can be obtained using
       the <u>confstr</u>() function or the <u>getconf</u> utility.

       The <u>&lt;poll.h&gt;</u> header shall define the following symbolic constants, zero or more of  which  may  be  OR'ed
       together to form the <u>events</u> or <u>revents</u> members in the <b>pollfd</b> structure:

       POLLIN        Data other than high-priority data may be read without blocking.

       POLLRDNORM    Normal data may be read without blocking.

       POLLRDBAND    Priority data may be read without blocking.

       POLLPRI       High priority data may be read without blocking.

       POLLOUT       Normal data may be written without blocking.

       POLLWRNORM    Equivalent to POLLOUT.

       POLLWRBAND    Priority data may be written.

       POLLERR       An error has occurred (<u>revents</u> only).

       POLLHUP       Device has been disconnected (<u>revents</u> only).

       POLLNVAL      Invalid <u>fd</u> member (<u>revents</u> only).

       The significance and semantics of normal, priority, and high-priority data are file and device-specific.

       The  following  shall  be declared as a function and may also be defined as a macro. A function prototype
       shall be provided.

           int   poll(struct pollfd [], nfds_t, int);

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
