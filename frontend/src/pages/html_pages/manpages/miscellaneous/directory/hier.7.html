       hier - description of the filesystem hierarchy

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A typical Linux system has, among others, the following directories:

       <u>/</u>      This is the root directory.  This is where the whole tree starts.

       <u><a href="file:/bin">/bin</a></u>   This  directory contains executable programs which are needed in single user mode and to bring the
              system up or repair it.

       <u><a href="file:/boot">/boot</a></u>  Contains static files for the boot loader.  This directory holds only the files which  are  needed
              during  the  boot process.  The map installer and configuration files should go to <u><a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u>.
              The operating system kernel (initrd for example) must be located in either <u>/</u> or <u><a href="file:/boot">/boot</a></u>.

       <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u>   Special or device files, which refer to physical devices.  See <b><a href="../man1/mknod.1.html">mknod</a></b>(1).

       <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u>   Contains configuration files which are local to the machine.  Some larger software packages,  like
              X11,  can  have  their own subdirectories below <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u>.  Site-wide configuration files may be placed
              here or in <u>/usr/etc</u>.  Nevertheless, programs should always look for these files in  <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u>  and  you
              may have links for these files to <u>/usr/etc</u>.

       <u><a href="file:/etc/opt">/etc/opt</a></u>
              Host-specific configuration files for add-on applications installed in <u><a href="file:/opt">/opt</a></u>.

       <u><a href="file:/etc/sgml">/etc/sgml</a></u>
              This directory contains the configuration files for SGML (optional).

       <u><a href="file:/etc/skel">/etc/skel</a></u>
              When  a  new user account is created, files from this directory are usually copied into the user's
              home directory.

       <u><a href="file:/etc/X11">/etc/X11</a></u>
              Configuration files for the X11 window system (optional).

       <u><a href="file:/etc/xml">/etc/xml</a></u>
              This directory contains the configuration files for XML (optional).

       <u><a href="file:/home">/home</a></u>  On machines with home directories for users, these are usually beneath this directory, directly or
              not.  The structure of this directory depends on local administration decisions (optional).

       <u><a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></u>   This directory should hold those shared libraries that are necessary to boot the system and to run
              the commands in the root filesystem.

       <u><a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>&lt;qual&gt;</u>
              These directories are variants of <u><a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></u> on  system  which  support  more  than  one  binary  format
              requiring separate libraries (optional).

       <u><a href="file:/lib/modules">/lib/modules</a></u>
              Loadable kernel modules (optional).

       <u>/lost+found</u>
              This  directory  contains  items  lost in the filesystem.  These items are usually chunks of files
              mangled as a consequence of a faulty disk or a system crash.

       <u><a href="file:/media">/media</a></u> This directory contains mount points for removable media such as CD and DVD disks or  USB  sticks.
              On  systems  where  more  than  one  device  exists  for  mounting  a certain type of media, mount
              directories can be created by appending a digit to the name of those available above starting with
              '0', but the unqualified name must also exist.

       <u>/media/floppy[1-9]</u>
              Floppy drive (optional).

       <u>/media/cdrom[1-9]</u>
              CD-ROM drive (optional).

       <u>/media/cdrecorder[1-9]</u>
              CD writer (optional).

       <u>/media/zip[1-9]</u>
              Zip drive (optional).

       <u>/media/usb[1-9]</u>
              USB drive (optional).

       <u><a href="file:/mnt">/mnt</a></u>   This directory is a mount point for a temporarily mounted filesystem.  In some distributions, <u><a href="file:/mnt">/mnt</a></u>
              contains subdirectories intended to be used as mount points for several temporary filesystems.

       <u><a href="file:/opt">/opt</a></u>   This directory should contain add-on packages that contain static files.

       <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u>  This is a mount point for the <u>proc</u> filesystem, which provides information about running  processes
              and the kernel.  This pseudo-filesystem is described in more detail in <b><a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</a></b>(5).

       <u><a href="file:/root">/root</a></u>  This directory is usually the home directory for the root user (optional).

       <u><a href="file:/run">/run</a></u>   This  directory  contains  information  which describes the system since it was booted.  Once this
              purpose was served by <u><a href="file:/var/run">/var/run</a></u> and programs may continue to use it.

       <u><a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a></u>  Like <u><a href="file:/bin">/bin</a></u>, this directory holds commands needed to boot the system,  but  which  are  usually  not
              executed by normal users.

       <u><a href="file:/srv">/srv</a></u>   This directory contains site-specific data that is served by this system.

       <u><a href="file:/sys">/sys</a></u>   This  is  a mount point for the sysfs filesystem, which provides information about the kernel like
              <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u>, but better structured, following the formalism of kobject infrastructure.

       <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>   This directory contains temporary files which may be deleted with no notice, such as by a  regular
              job or at system boot up.

       <u><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></u>   This directory is usually mounted from a separate partition.  It should hold only shareable, read-
              only data, so that it can be mounted by various machines running Linux.

       <u>/usr/X11R6</u>
              The X-Window system, version 11 release 6 (present in FHS 2.3, removed in FHS 3.0).

       <u>/usr/X11R6/bin</u>
              Binaries  which  belong  to  the  X-Window  system;  often, there is a symbolic link from the more
              traditional <u>/usr/bin/X11</u> to here.

       <u>/usr/X11R6/lib</u>
              Data files associated with the X-Window system.

       <u>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11</u>
              These contain miscellaneous files needed  to  run  X;   Often,  there  is  a  symbolic  link  from
              <u>/usr/lib/X11</u> to this directory.

       <u>/usr/X11R6/include/X11</u>
              Contains include files needed for compiling programs using the X11 window system.  Often, there is
              a symbolic link from <u>/usr/include/X11</u> to this directory.

       <u><a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a></u>
              This  is  the  primary  directory for executable programs.  Most programs executed by normal users
              which are not needed for booting or for repairing the system and which are not  installed  locally
              should be placed in this directory.

       <u>/usr/bin/mh</u>
              Commands for the MH mail handling system (optional).

       <u>/usr/bin/X11</u>
              This is the traditional place to look for X11 executables; on Linux, it usually is a symbolic link
              to <u>/usr/X11R6/bin</u>.

       <u>/usr/dict</u>
              Replaced by <u><a href="file:/usr/share/dict">/usr/share/dict</a></u>.

       <u>/usr/doc</u>
              Replaced by <u><a href="file:/usr/share/doc">/usr/share/doc</a></u>.

       <u>/usr/etc</u>
              Site-wide  configuration  files  to  be  shared  between  several  machines  may be stored in this
              directory.  However, commands should always reference those files using the <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> directory.  Links
              from files in <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> should point to the appropriate files in <u>/usr/etc</u>.

       <u><a href="file:/usr/games">/usr/games</a></u>
              Binaries for games and educational programs (optional).

       <u><a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a></u>
              Include files for the C compiler.

       <u>/usr/include/bsd</u>
              BSD compatibility include files (optional).

       <u>/usr/include/X11</u>
              Include files for the C compiler and the X-Window system.  This is  usually  a  symbolic  link  to
              <u>/usr/X11R6/include/X11</u>.

       <u>/usr/include/asm</u>
              Include  files  which  declare  some  assembler  functions.   This  used  to be a symbolic link to
              <u>/usr/src/linux/include/asm</u>.

       <u><a href="file:/usr/include/linux">/usr/include/linux</a></u>
              This contains information which may change from system release to system release and used to be  a
              symbolic link to <u>/usr/src/linux/include/linux</u> to get at operating-system-specific information.

              (Note  that  one  should have include files there that work correctly with the current libc and in
              user space.  However, Linux kernel source is not designed to be used with user programs  and  does
              not  know  anything about the libc you are using.  It is very likely that things will break if you
              let <u>/usr/include/asm</u> and <u><a href="file:/usr/include/linux">/usr/include/linux</a></u> point at a random kernel tree.  Debian  systems  don't
              do this and use headers from a known good kernel version, provided in the libc*-dev package.)

       <u>/usr/include/g++</u>
              Include files to use with the GNU C++ compiler.

       <u><a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a></u>
              Object libraries, including dynamic libraries, plus some executables which usually are not invoked
              directly.  More complicated programs may have whole subdirectories there.

       <u><a href="file:/usr/libexec">/usr/libexec</a></u>
              Directory  contains  binaries for internal use only and they are not meant to be executed directly
              by users shell or scripts.

       <u><a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a>&lt;qual&gt;</u>
              These directories are variants of <u><a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a></u> on system which support more  than  one  binary  format
              requiring  separate  libraries,  except  that  the  symbolic link <u><a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a></u>qual<u>/X11</u> is not required
              (optional).

       <u>/usr/lib/X11</u>
              The usual place for data files associated with X programs,  and  configuration  files  for  the  X
              system itself.  On Linux, it usually is a symbolic link to <u>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11</u>.

       <u>/usr/lib/gcc-lib</u>
              contains executables and include files for the GNU C compiler, <b><a href="../man1/gcc.1.html">gcc</a></b>(1).

              Files for <b><a href="../man1/uucp.1.html">uucp</a></b>(1).

       <u><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></u>
              This is where programs which are local to the site typically go.

       <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u>
              Binaries for programs local to the site.

       <u>/usr/local/doc</u>
