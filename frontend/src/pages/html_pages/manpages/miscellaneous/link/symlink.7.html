       symlink - symbolic link handling

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Symbolic  links  are  files  that act as pointers to other files.  To understand their behavior, you must
       first understand how hard links work.

       A hard link to a file is indistinguishable from the original file because it is a reference to the object
       underlying the original filename.  (To be precise: each of the hard links to a file is a reference to the
       same <u>inode</u> <u>number</u>, where an inode number is an index into the inode table, which contains metadata  about
       all  files  on  a  filesystem.   See  <b><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></b>(2).)   Changes  to  a file are independent of the name used to
       reference the file.  Hard links may not refer to directories (to prevent the possibility of loops  within
       the  filesystem  tree,  which  would  confuse  many  programs)  and  may  not refer to files on different
       filesystems (because inode numbers are not unique across filesystems).

       A symbolic link is a special type of file whose contents are a string that is  the  pathname  of  another
       file,  the  file  to  which  the  link  refers.   (The  contents  of  a  symbolic  link can be read using
       <b><a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink</a></b>(2).)  In other words, a symbolic link is a pointer to another name, and  not  to  an  underlying
       object.  For this reason, symbolic links may refer to directories and may cross filesystem boundaries.

       There  is  no requirement that the pathname referred to by a symbolic link should exist.  A symbolic link
       that refers to a pathname that does not exist is said to be a <u>dangling</u> <u>link</u>.

       Because a symbolic link and its referenced object coexist in the filesystem  name  space,  confusion  can
       arise  in  distinguishing  between  the  link  itself  and the referenced object.  On historical systems,
       commands and system calls adopted their own link-following conventions  in  a  somewhat  ad-hoc  fashion.
       Rules for a more uniform approach, as they are implemented on Linux and other systems, are outlined here.
       It  is important that site-local applications also conform to these rules, so that the user interface can
       be as consistent as possible.

   <b>Magic</b> <b>links</b>
       There is a special class of symbolic-link-like objects known as "magic links",  which  can  be  found  in
       certain  pseudofilesystems  such  as <b><a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</a></b>(5) (examples include <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/exe</u> and <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/fd/</u>*).  Unlike
       normal symbolic links, magic links are not resolved through pathname-expansion, but instead act as direct
       references to the kernel's own representation of a file handle.  As such, these magic links  allow  users
       to  access files which cannot be referenced with normal paths (such as unlinked files still referenced by
       a running program ).

       Because they can bypass ordinary <b><a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces</a></b>(7)-based restrictions, magic links have  been  used  as
       attack vectors in various exploits.

   <b>Symbolic</b> <b>link</b> <b>ownership,</b> <b>permissions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>timestamps</b>
       The  owner  and  group  of  an existing symbolic link can be changed using <b><a href="../man2/lchown.2.html">lchown</a></b>(2).  The ownership of a
       symbolic link matters when the link is being removed or renamed in a directory that has  the  sticky  bit
       set (see <b><a href="../man7/inode.7.html">inode</a></b>(7)), and when the <u>fs.protected_symlinks</u> sysctl is set (see <b><a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</a></b>(5)).

       The  last access and last modification timestamps of a symbolic link can be changed using <b><a href="../man2/utimensat.2.html">utimensat</a></b>(2) or
       <b><a href="../man3/lutimes.3.html">lutimes</a></b>(3).

       On Linux, the permissions of an ordinary symbolic link are not used in any  operations;  the  permissions
       are always 0777 (read, write, and execute for all user categories), and can't be changed.

       However,  magic  links  do  not follow this rule.  They can have a non-0777 mode, though this mode is not
       currently used in any permission checks.

   <b>Obtaining</b> <b>a</b> <b>file</b> <b>descriptor</b> <b>that</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbolic</b> <b>link</b>
       Using the combination of the <b>O_PATH</b> and <b>O_NOFOLLOW</b> flags to <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2) yields a file descriptor that can  be
       passed as the <u>dirfd</u> argument in system calls such as <b><a href="../man2/fstatat.2.html">fstatat</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/fchownat.2.html">fchownat</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/fchmodat.2.html">fchmodat</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/linkat.2.html">linkat</a></b>(2), and
       <b><a href="../man2/readlinkat.2.html">readlinkat</a></b>(2), in order to operate on the symbolic link itself (rather than the file to which it refers).

       By  default (i.e., if the <b>AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW</b> flag is not specified), if <b><a href="../man2/name_to_handle_at.2.html">name_to_handle_at</a></b>(2) is applied to
       a symbolic link, it yields a handle for the symbolic link (rather than the file to which it refers).  One
       can then obtain a file descriptor for the symbolic link (rather than the file  to  which  it  refers)  by
       specifying the <b>O_PATH</b> flag in a subsequent call to <b><a href="../man2/open_by_handle_at.2.html">open_by_handle_at</a></b>(2).  Again, that file descriptor can
       be used in the aforementioned system calls to operate on the symbolic link itself.

   <b>Handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>symbolic</b> <b>links</b> <b>by</b> <b>system</b> <b>calls</b> <b>and</b> <b>commands</b>
       Symbolic links are handled either by operating on the link itself, or by operating on the object referred
       to  by the link.  In the latter case, an application or system call is said to <u>follow</u> the link.  Symbolic
       links may refer to other symbolic links, in which case the links are dereferenced until an object that is
       not a symbolic link is found, a symbolic link that refers to a file which does not exist is found,  or  a
       loop  is  detected.  (Loop detection is done by placing an upper limit on the number of links that may be
       followed, and an error results if this limit is exceeded.)

       There are three separate areas that need to be discussed.  They are as follows:

       •  Symbolic links used as filename arguments for system calls.

       •  Symbolic links specified as command-line arguments to utilities that are not traversing a file tree.

       •  Symbolic links encountered by utilities that are traversing a  file  tree  (either  specified  on  the
          command line or encountered as part of the file hierarchy walk).

       Before  describing  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links  by  system  calls  and commands, we require some
       terminology.  Given a pathname of the form <u>a/b/c</u>, the part preceding  the  final  slash  (i.e.,  <u>a/b</u>)  is
       called  the  <u>dirname</u>  component,  and the part following the final slash (i.e., <u>c</u>) is called the <u>basename</u>
       component.

   <b>Treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>symbolic</b> <b>links</b> <b>in</b> <b>system</b> <b>calls</b>
       The first area is symbolic links used as filename arguments for system calls.

       The treatment of symbolic links within a pathname passed to a system call is as follows:

       (1)  Within the dirname component of a pathname, symbolic links  are  always  followed  in  nearly  every
            system  call.   (This  is  also true for commands.)  The one exception is <b><a href="../man2/openat2.2.html">openat2</a></b>(2), which provides
            flags that can be used to explicitly prevent following of symbolic links in the dirname component.

       (2)  Except as noted below, all system calls follow  symbolic  links  in  the  basename  component  of  a
            pathname.  For example, if there were a symbolic link <u>slink</u> which pointed to a file named <u>afile</u>, the
            system call <u>open("slink"</u> <u>...)</u> would return a file descriptor referring to the file <u>afile</u>.

       Various  system  calls  do  not  follow links in the basename component of a pathname, and operate on the
       symbolic link itself.  They are: <b><a href="../man2/lchown.2.html">lchown</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/lgetxattr.2.html">lgetxattr</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/llistxattr.2.html">llistxattr</a></b>(2),  <b><a href="../man2/lremovexattr.2.html">lremovexattr</a></b>(2),  <b><a href="../man2/lsetxattr.2.html">lsetxattr</a></b>(2),
       <b><a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/rmdir.2.html">rmdir</a></b>(2), and <b><a href="../man2/unlink.2.html">unlink</a></b>(2).

       Certain  other  system  calls  optionally  follow symbolic links in the basename component of a pathname.
       They are: <b><a href="../man2/faccessat.2.html">faccessat</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/fchownat.2.html">fchownat</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/fstatat.2.html">fstatat</a></b>(2),  <b><a href="../man2/linkat.2.html">linkat</a></b>(2),  <b><a href="../man2/name_to_handle_at.2.html">name_to_handle_at</a></b>(2),  <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2),  <b><a href="../man2/openat.2.html">openat</a></b>(2),
       <b><a href="../man2/open_by_handle_at.2.html">open_by_handle_at</a></b>(2),  and  <b><a href="../man2/utimensat.2.html">utimensat</a></b>(2);  see  their  manual pages for details.  Because <b><a href="../man3/remove.3.html">remove</a></b>(3) is an
       alias for <b><a href="../man2/unlink.2.html">unlink</a></b>(2), that library function also does not follow symbolic links.  When <b><a href="../man2/rmdir.2.html">rmdir</a></b>(2) is applied
       to a symbolic link, it fails with the error <b>ENOTDIR</b>.

       <b><a href="../man2/link.2.html">link</a></b>(2) warrants special discussion.  POSIX.1-2001 specifies that <b><a href="../man2/link.2.html">link</a></b>(2) should dereference  <u>oldpath</u>  if
       it  is  a  symbolic  link.   However,  Linux does not do this.  (By default, Solaris is the same, but the
       POSIX.1-2001 specified behavior can be obtained with suitable compiler  options.)   POSIX.1-2008  changed
       the specification to allow either behavior in an implementation.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>not</b> <b>traversing</b> <b>a</b> <b>file</b> <b>tree</b>
       The  second  area  is symbolic links, specified as command-line filename arguments, to commands which are
       not traversing a file tree.

       Except as noted below, commands follow symbolic links named as command-line arguments.  For  example,  if
       there were a symbolic link <u>slink</u> which pointed to a file named <u>afile</u>, the command <u>cat</u> <u>slink</u> would display
       the contents of the file <u>afile</u>.

       It is important to realize that this rule includes commands which may optionally traverse file trees; for
       example, the command <u>chown</u> <u>file</u> is included in this rule, while the command <u>chown</u> <u>-R</u> <u>file</u>, which performs
       a tree traversal, is not.  (The latter is described in the third area, below.)

       If  it  is  explicitly  intended  that  the command operate on the symbolic link instead of following the
       symbolic link—for example, it is desired that <u>chown</u> <u>slink</u> change the ownership of the file that <u>slink</u> is,
       whether it is a symbolic link or not—then the <u>-h</u> option should be used.  In the above example, <u>chown</u> <u>root</u>
       <u>slink</u> would change the ownership of the file referred to by <u>slink</u>, while <u>chown</u> <u>-h</u> <u>root</u> <u>slink</u> would change
       the ownership of <u>slink</u> itself.

       There are some exceptions to this rule:

       •  The <b><a href="../man1/mv.1.html">mv</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/rm.1.html">rm</a></b>(1) commands do not follow symbolic links named as arguments, but respectively attempt
          to rename and delete them.  (Note, if the symbolic link references a file via a relative path,  moving
          it  to  another  directory  may  very  well  cause it to stop working, since the path may no longer be
          correct.)

       •  The <b><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></b>(1) command is also an exception to this rule.  For compatibility with  historic  systems  (when
          <b><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></b>(1)  is  not  doing  a  tree  walk—that  is,  <u>-R</u> option is not specified), the <b><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></b>(1) command follows
          symbolic links named as arguments if the <u>-H</u> or <u>-L</u> option is specified, or if the <u>-F</u>, <u>-d</u>, or <u>-l</u> options
          are not specified.  (The <b><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></b>(1) command is the only command where the <u>-H</u>  and  <u>-L</u>  options  affect  its
          behavior even though it is not doing a walk of a file tree.)

       •  The  <b><a href="../man1/file.1.html">file</a></b>(1)  command is also an exception to this rule.  The <b><a href="../man1/file.1.html">file</a></b>(1) command does not follow symbolic
          links named as argument by default.  The <b><a href="../man1/file.1.html">file</a></b>(1) command does follow symbolic links named as  argument
          if the <u>-L</u> option is specified.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>traversing</b> <b>a</b> <b>file</b> <b>tree</b>
       The  following  commands  either  optionally or always traverse file trees: <b><a href="../man1/chgrp.1.html">chgrp</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/chmod.1.html">chmod</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/chown.1.html">chown</a></b>(1),
       <b><a href="../man1/cp.1.html">cp</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/du.1.html">du</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/find.1.html">find</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/pax.1.html">pax</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/rm.1.html">rm</a></b>(1), and <b><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a></b>(1).

       It is important to realize that the following rules apply equally to symbolic  links  encountered  during
       the file tree traversal and symbolic links listed as command-line arguments.

       The  <u>first</u>  <u>rule</u>  applies to symbolic links that reference files other than directories.  Operations that
       apply to symbolic links are performed on the links themselves, but otherwise the links are ignored.

       The command <u>rm</u> <u>-r</u> <u>slink</u> <u>directory</u> will remove <u>slink</u>, as well as any symbolic  links  encountered  in  the
       tree  traversal  of  <u>directory</u>,  because symbolic links may be removed.  In no case will <b><a href="../man1/rm.1.html">rm</a></b>(1) affect the
       file referred to by <u>slink</u>.

       The <u>second</u> <u>rule</u> applies to symbolic links that refer  to  directories.   Symbolic  links  that  refer  to
       directories are never followed by default.  This is often referred to as a "physical" walk, as opposed to
       a "logical" walk (where symbolic links that refer to directories are followed).

       Certain  conventions  are  (should be) followed as consistently as possible by commands that perform file
       tree walks:

       •  A command can be made to follow any symbolic links named on the command line, regardless of  the  type
          of file they reference, by specifying the <u>-H</u> (for "half-logical") flag.  This flag is intended to make
          the  command-line name space look like the logical name space.  (Note, for commands that do not always
          do file tree traversals, the <u>-H</u> flag will be ignored if the <u>-R</u> flag is not also specified.)

          For example, the command <u>chown</u> <u>-HR</u> <u>user</u> <u>slink</u> will traverse the file  hierarchy  rooted  in  the  file
          pointed  to  by <u>slink</u>.  Note, the <u>-H</u> is not the same as the previously discussed <u>-h</u> flag.  The <u>-H</u> flag
          causes symbolic links specified on the command line to be dereferenced for the purposes  of  both  the
          action  to be performed and the tree walk, and it is as if the user had specified the name of the file
          to which the symbolic link pointed.

       •  A command can be made to follow any symbolic links named on the command line, as well as any  symbolic
          links  encountered  during the traversal, regardless of the type of file they reference, by specifying
          the <u>-L</u> (for "logical") flag.  This flag is intended to make  the  entire  name  space  look  like  the
          logical  name space.  (Note, for commands that do not always do file tree traversals, the <u>-L</u> flag will
          be ignored if the <u>-R</u> flag is not also specified.)

          For example, the command <u>chown</u> <u>-LR</u> <u>user</u> <u>slink</u> will change the owner of the file referred to by  <u>slink</u>.
          If <u>slink</u> refers to a directory, <b>chown</b> will traverse the file hierarchy rooted in the directory that it
          references.  In addition, if any symbolic links are encountered in any file tree that <b>chown</b> traverses,
          they will be treated in the same fashion as <u>slink</u>.

       •  A  command  can  be  made  to provide the default behavior by specifying the <u>-P</u> (for "physical") flag.
          This flag is intended to make the entire name space look like the physical name space.

       For commands that do not by default do file tree traversals, the <u>-H</u>, <u>-L</u>, and <u>-P</u> flags are ignored if  the
       <u>-R</u>  flag  is not also specified.  In addition, you may specify the <u>-H</u>, <u>-L</u>, and <u>-P</u> options more than once;
       the last one specified determines the command's behavior.  This  is  intended  to  permit  you  to  alias
       commands to behave one way or the other, and then override that behavior on the command line.

       The <b><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/rm.1.html">rm</a></b>(1) commands have exceptions to these rules:

       •  The  <b><a href="../man1/rm.1.html">rm</a></b>(1)  command operates on the symbolic link, and not the file it references, and therefore never
          follows a symbolic link.  The <b><a href="../man1/rm.1.html">rm</a></b>(1) command does not support the <u>-H</u>, <u>-L</u>, or <u>-P</u> options.

       •  To maintain compatibility with historic systems, the <b><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></b>(1) command acts a little differently.  If  you
          do  not  specify  the <u>-F</u>, <u>-d</u>, or <u>-l</u> options, <b><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></b>(1) will follow symbolic links specified on the command
          line.  If the <u>-L</u> flag is specified, <b><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></b>(1) follows  all  symbolic  links,  regardless  of  their  type,
          whether specified on the command line or encountered in the tree walk.
