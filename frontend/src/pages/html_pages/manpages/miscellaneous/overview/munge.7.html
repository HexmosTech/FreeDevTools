       munge - MUNGE overview

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       MUNGE  (MUNGE  Uid  'N'  Gid  Emporium)  is  an  authentication  service for creating and validating user
       credentials.  It is designed to be highly scalable for use in an HPC cluster environment.  It provides  a
       portable  API  for encoding the user's identity into a tamper-proof credential that can be obtained by an
       untrusted client and forwarded by untrusted intermediaries within a security realm.  Clients within  this
       realm  can  create  and  validate  credentials  without  the  use  of root privileges, reserved ports, or
       platform-specific methods.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The need for MUNGE arose out of the HPC cluster environment.  Consider the  scenario  in  which  a  local
       daemon  running on a login node receives a client request and forwards it on to remote daemons running on
       compute nodes within the cluster.  Since the user has already logged on to  the  login  node,  the  local
       daemon  just  needs a reliable means of ascertaining the UID and GID of the client process.  Furthermore,
       the remote daemons need a mechanism to ensure the forwarded authentication data has not been subsequently
       altered.

       A common solution to this problem is to use Unix domain sockets to determine the identity  of  the  local
       client,  and  then  forward  this  information  on to remote hosts via trusted rsh connections.  But this
       presents several new problems.  First, there is no portable API for determining the identity of a  client
       over  a  Unix  domain  socket.   Second, rsh connections must originate from a reserved port; the limited
       number of reserved ports available on a given host directly limits scalability.  Third,  root  privileges
       are  required  in  order  to  bind  to  a  reserved  port.   Finally, the remote daemons have no means of
       determining whether the client identity is authentic.  MUNGE solves all of these problems.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       A process creates a  credential  by  requesting  one  from  the  local  MUNGE  service,  either  via  the
       <b>munge_encode</b>()  C  library call or the <b>munge</b> executable.  The encoded credential contains the UID and GID
       of the originating process.  This process sends the credential to another  process  within  the  security
       realm as a means of proving its identity.  The receiving process validates the credential with the use of
       its  local  MUNGE  service,  either via the <b>munge_decode</b>() C library call or the <b>unmunge</b> executable.  The
       decoded credential provides the receiving process with a reliable means of ascertaining the UID  and  GID
       of the originating process.  This information can be used for accounting or access control decisions.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       The  contents  of the credential (including any optional payload data) are encrypted with a key shared by
       all <b>munged</b> daemons within the security realm.  The integrity of the credential is ensured  by  a  message
       authentication code (MAC).  The credential is valid for a limited time defined by its time-to-live (TTL);
       this presumes clocks within a security realm are in sync.  Unexpired credentials are tracked by the local
       <b>munged</b>  daemon  in  order  to  prevent  replay  attacks on a given host.  Decoding of a credential can be
       restricted to a particular user and/or group ID.  The payload data can  be  used  for  purposes  such  as
       embedding  the  destination's  address  to  ensure  the credential is only valid on a specific host.  The
       internal format of the credential is encoded in a platform-independent manner.  And the credential itself
       is base64 encoded to allow it to be transmitted over virtually any transport.
