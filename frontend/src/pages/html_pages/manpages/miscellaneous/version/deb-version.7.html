       deb-version - Debian package version number format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       [<u>epoch</u><b>:</b>]<u>upstream-version</u>[<b>-</b><u>debian-revision</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Version numbers as used for Debian binary and source packages consist of three components.  These are:

       <u>epoch</u>
           This  is  a  single  (generally  small)  unsigned  integer.  It may be omitted, in which case zero is
           assumed.  If it is omitted then the <u>upstream-version</u> may not contain any colons.

           It is provided to allow mistakes in the version numbers of older versions of a package,  and  also  a
           package's previous version numbering schemes, to be left behind.

       <u>upstream-version</u>
           This  is  the  main  part  of  the  version number.  It is usually the version number of the original
           (“upstream”) package from which the <u>.deb</u> file has been made, if this  is  applicable.   Usually  this
           will  be  in  the same format as that specified by the upstream author(s); however, it may need to be
           reformatted to fit into the package management system's format and comparison scheme.

           The comparison behavior of the package management system with  respect  to  the  <u>upstream-version</u>  is
           described below.  The <u>upstream-version</u> portion of the version number is mandatory.

           The  <u>upstream-version</u> may contain only alphanumerics (“A-Za-z0-9”) and the characters <b>.</b> <b>+</b> <b>-</b> <b>:</b> <b>~</b> (full
           stop, plus, hyphen, colon, tilde) and should start with a digit.  If there is no <u>debian-revision</u> then
           hyphens are not allowed; if there is no <u>epoch</u> then colons are not allowed.

       <u>debian-revision</u>
           This part of the version number specifies the version of the Debian package  based  on  the  upstream
           version.   It may contain only alphanumerics and the characters <b>+</b> <b>.</b> <b>~</b> (plus, full stop, tilde) and is
           compared in the same way as the <u>upstream-version</u> is.

           It is optional; if it isn't present then the <u>upstream-version</u> may not contain a hyphen.  This  format
           represents  the  case  where  a piece of software was written specifically to be turned into a Debian
           package, and so there is only one “debianization” of it  and  therefore  no  revision  indication  is
           required.

           It is conventional to restart the <u>debian-revision</u> at ‘1’ each time the <u>upstream-version</u> is increased.

           Dpkg  will  break  the  version  number  apart  at the last hyphen in the string (if there is one) to
           determine the <u>upstream-version</u> and  <u>debian-revision</u>.   The  absence  of  a  <u>debian-revision</u>  compares
           earlier  than the presence of one (but note that the <u>debian-revision</u> is the least significant part of
           the version number).

   <b>Sorting</b> <b>algorithm</b>
       The <u>upstream-version</u> and <u>debian-revision</u> parts are compared by the package management  system  using  the
       same algorithm:

       The strings are compared from left to right.

       First  the  initial part of each string consisting entirely of non-digit characters is determined.  These
       two parts (one of which may be empty) are compared lexically.  If a difference is found it  is  returned.
       The lexical comparison is a comparison of ASCII values modified so that all the letters sort earlier than
       all  the non-letters and so that a tilde sorts before anything, even the end of a part.  For example, the
       following parts are in sorted order: ‘~~’, ‘~~a’, ‘~’, the empty part, ‘a’.

       Then the initial part of the remainder of each string which consists  entirely  of  digit  characters  is
       determined.   The  numerical values of these two parts are compared, and any difference found is returned
       as the result of the comparison.  For these purposes an empty string (which can only occur at the end  of
       one or both version strings being compared) counts as zero.

       These two steps (comparing and removing initial non-digit strings and initial digit strings) are repeated
       until a difference is found or both strings are exhausted.

       Note that the purpose of epochs is to allow us to leave behind mistakes in version numbering, and to cope
       with  situations  where  the  version  numbering scheme changes.  It is <b>not</b> intended to cope with version
       numbers containing strings of letters which the package  management  system  cannot  interpret  (such  as
       ‘ALPHA’ or ‘pre-’), or with silly orderings.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The tilde character and its special sorting properties were introduced in dpkg 1.10 and some parts of the
       dpkg build scripts only gained support for it later in the 1.10.x series.
