       debhelper-obsolete-compat - List of no longer supported compat levels

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This document contains the upgrade guidelines from all compat levels which are no longer supported.
       Accordingly it is mostly for historical purposes and to assist people upgrading from a non-supported
       compat level to a supported level.

       For upgrades from supported compat levels, please see <b><a href="../man7/debhelper.7.html">debhelper</a></b>(7).

</pre><h4><b>UPGRADE</b> <b>LIST</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>COMPAT</b> <b>LEVELS</b></h4><pre>
       The following is the list of now obsolete compat levels and their changes.

       v7  This is the lowest supported compatibility level.

           Changes from v6 are:

           -       <b>dh_install</b>,  will fall back to looking for files in <u>debian/tmp</u> if it doesn't find them in the
                   current directory (or wherever you tell it look using <b>--sourcedir</b>). This allows <b>dh_install</b> to
                   interoperate with <b>dh_auto_install</b>, which installs to <u>debian/tmp</u>, without needing any  special
                   parameters.

           -       <b>dh_clean</b> will read <u>debian/clean</u> and delete files listed there.

           -       <b>dh_clean</b> will delete toplevel <u>*-stamp</u> files.

           -       <b>dh_installchangelogs</b> will guess at what file is the upstream changelog if none is specified.

       v6  Changes from v5 are:

           -       Commands  that generate maintainer script fragments will order the fragments in reverse order
                   for the <u>prerm</u> and <u>postrm</u> scripts.

           -       <b>dh_installwm</b> will install a slave manpage link for <u>x-window-manager.1.gz</u>, if it sees the  man
                   page in <u>usr/share/man/man1</u> in the package build directory.

           -       <b>dh_builddeb</b> did not previously delete everything matching <b>DH_ALWAYS_EXCLUDE</b>, if it was set to
                   a list of things to exclude, such as <b>CVS:.svn:.git</b>. Now it does.

           -       <b>dh_installman</b>  allows  overwriting  existing  man  pages  in  the package build directory. In
                   previous compatibility levels it silently refuses to do this.

           This mode is deprecated.

       v5  Changes from v4 are:

           -       Comments are ignored in debhelper config files.

           -       <b>dh_strip</b> <b>--dbg-package</b> now specifies the name of a package to put debugging symbols  in,  not
                   the packages to take the symbols from.

           -       <b>dh_installdocs</b> skips installing empty files.

           -       <b>dh_install</b> errors out if wildcards expand to nothing.

       v4  Changes from v3 are:

           -       <b>dh_makeshlibs</b>  <b>-V</b>  will  not  include  the Debian part of the version number in the generated
                   dependency line in the shlibs file.

           -       You are encouraged to put the new  <b>${misc:Depends}</b>  into  <u>debian/control</u>  to  supplement  the
                   <b>${shlibs:Depends}</b> field.

           -       <b>dh_fixperms</b> will make all files in <u>bin/</u> directories and in <u>etc/init.d</u> executable.

           -       <b>dh_link</b> will correct existing links to conform with policy.

           This mode is deprecated.

       v3  This mode works like v2, with the following additions:

           -       Debhelper  config  files support globbing via <b>*</b> and <b>?</b>, when appropriate. To turn this off and
                   use those characters raw, just prefix with a backslash.

           -       <b>dh_makeshlibs</b> makes the <u>postinst</u> and <u>postrm</u> scripts call <b>ldconfig</b>.

           -       Every file in <u>etc/</u> is automatically flagged as a conffile by <b>dh_installdeb</b>.

           This mode is deprecated.

       v2  In this mode, debhelper will consistently use debian/<u>package</u> as the package tree directory for  every
           package that is built.

           This mode is deprecated.

       v1  This  is  the  original  debhelper  compatibility  level, and so it is the default one. In this mode,
           debhelper will use <u>debian/tmp</u> as the package tree directory for the first binary  package  listed  in
           the control file, while using debian/<u>package</u> for all other packages listed in the <u>control</u> file.

           This mode is deprecated.
