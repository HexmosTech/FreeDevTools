       groff_rfc1345 - special character names from RFC 1345 and Vim digraphs

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The  file  <u>rfc1345.tmac</u>  defines  special  character  escape  sequences  for  <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7) based on the glyph
       mnemonics specified in RFC 1345 and the digraph table of the  text  editor  Vim.   Each  escape  sequence
       translates  to  a  Unicode code point, and will render correctly if the underlying font is a Unicode font
       that covers the code point.

       For example, “<b>\[Rx]</b>” is the “recipe” or “prescription take” symbol, and maps to the  code  point  U+211E.
       <u>groff</u> lets you write it as “<b>\[u211E]</b>”, but “<b>\[Rx]</b>” is more mnemonic.

       For  a  list of the glyph names provided, please see the file <u>rfc1345.tmac</u>, which contains definitions of
       the form
              .char \[Rx] \[u211E]    \" PRESCRIPTION TAKE
       where <b>.char</b>'s first argument defines a <u>groff</u> special character escape  sequence  with  a  mnemonic  glyph
       name, its second argument is a special character escape sequence based on the code point, and the comment
       describes the glyph defined.

       The  RFC 1345 glyph names cover a wide range of Unicode code points, including supplemental Latin, Greek,
       Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, Hiragana, Katakana, and Bopomofo letters, punctuation, math notation,  currency
       symbols, industrial and entertainment icons, and box-drawing symbols.

       The  Vim  digraph  table  is practically a subset of RFC 1345 (being limited to two-character mnemonics),
       but, as a newer implementation, adds four mnemonics not specified in the RFC  (the  horizontal  ellipsis,
       the Euro sign, and two mappings for the rouble sign).  These have also been added to <u>rfc1345.tmac</u>.

       <u>rfc1345.tmac</u> contains a total of 1,696 glyph names.  It is not an error to load <u>rfc1345.tmac</u> if your font
       does not have all the glyphs, as long as it contains the glyphs that you actually use in your document.

       The  RFC 1345 mnemonics are not identical in every case to the mappings for special character glyph names
       that are built in to <u>groff</u>;  for  example,  “<b>\[&lt;&lt;]</b>”  means  the  “much  less  than”  sign  (U+226A)  when
       <u>rfc1345.tmac</u>  is  not  loaded  and this special character is not otherwise defined by a document or macro
       package.  <u>rfc1345.tmac</u> redefines “<b>\[&lt;&lt;]</b>” to the “left-pointing double  angle  quotation  mark”  (U+00AB).
       See <u><a href="../man7/groff_char.7.html">groff_char</a></u>(7) for the full list of predefined special character escape sequences.

   <b>Usage</b>
       Load  the  <u>rfc1345.tmac</u>  file.   This  can  be done by either adding “<b>.mso</b> <b>rfc1345.tmac</b>” to your document
       before the first use of any of the glyph names the macro file defines, or by using  the  <u><a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff</a></u>(1)  option
       “<b>-m</b> <b>rfc1345</b>” from the shell.

   <b>Bugs</b>
       As  the  <u>groff</u> Texinfo manual notes, “[o]nly the current font is checked for ligatures and kerns; neither
       special fonts nor entities defined with the <b>char</b> request (and its  siblings)  are  taken  into  account.”
       Many  of  the characters defined in <u>rfc1345.tmac</u> are accented Latin letters, and will be affected by this
       deficiency, producing subpar typography.
