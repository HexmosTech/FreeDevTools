</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       queue - implementations of linked lists and queues

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>&lt;sys/queue.h&gt;</u>  header  file  provides  a set of macros that define and operate on the following data
       structures:

       SLIST  singly linked lists

       LIST   doubly linked lists

       STAILQ singly linked tail queues

       TAILQ  doubly linked tail queues

       CIRCLEQ
              doubly linked circular queues

       All structures support the following functionality:

       •  Insertion of a new entry at the head of the list.

       •  Insertion of a new entry after any element in the list.

       •  <a href="../man1/O.1.html">O</a>(1) removal of an entry from the head of the list.

       •  Forward traversal through the list.

       Code size and execution time depend on the complexity of the data structure being  used,  so  programmers
       should take care to choose the appropriate one.

   <b>Singly</b> <b>linked</b> <b>lists</b> <b>(SLIST)</b>
       Singly  linked  lists are the simplest and support only the above functionality.  Singly linked lists are
       ideal for applications with large datasets and few or no removals, or  for  implementing  a  LIFO  queue.
       Singly linked lists add the following functionality:

       •  O(n) removal of any entry in the list.

   <b>Singly</b> <b>linked</b> <b>tail</b> <b>queues</b> <b>(STAILQ)</b>
       Singly linked tail queues add the following functionality:

       •  Entries can be added at the end of a list.

       •  O(n) removal of any entry in the list.

       •  They may be concatenated.

       However:

       •  All list insertions must specify the head of the list.

       •  Each head entry requires two pointers rather than one.

       Singly  linked  tail queues are ideal for applications with large datasets and few or no removals, or for
       implementing a FIFO queue.

   <b>Doubly</b> <b>linked</b> <b>data</b> <b>structures</b>
       All doubly linked types of data structures (lists and tail queues) additionally allow:

       •  Insertion of a new entry before any element in the list.

       •  <a href="../man1/O.1.html">O</a>(1) removal of any entry in the list.

       However:

       •  Each element requires two pointers rather than one.

   <b>Doubly</b> <b>linked</b> <b>lists</b> <b>(LIST)</b>
       Linked lists are the simplest of the doubly linked data structures.  They add the following functionality
       over the above:

       •  They may be traversed backwards.

       However:

       •  To traverse backwards, an entry to begin the traversal and the list in which it is contained  must  be
          specified.

   <b>Doubly</b> <b>linked</b> <b>tail</b> <b>queues</b> <b>(TAILQ)</b>
       Tail queues add the following functionality:

       •  Entries can be added at the end of a list.

       •  They may be traversed backwards, from tail to head.

       •  They may be concatenated.

       However:

       •  All list insertions and removals must specify the head of the list.

       •  Each head entry requires two pointers rather than one.

   <b>Doubly</b> <b>linked</b> <b>circular</b> <b>queues</b> <b>(CIRCLEQ)</b>
       Circular queues add the following functionality over the above:

       •  The first and last entries are connected.

       However:

       •  The termination condition for traversal is more complex.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       BSD.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <u>&lt;sys/queue.h&gt;</u> macros first appeared in 4.4BSD.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Some  BSDs  provide  SIMPLEQ instead of STAILQ.  They are identical, but for historical reasons they were
       named differently on different BSDs.  STAILQ originated on FreeBSD, and  SIMPLEQ  originated  on  NetBSD.
       For  compatibility  reasons,  some  systems  provide both sets of macros.  glibc provides both STAILQ and
       SIMPLEQ, which are identical except for a missing SIMPLEQ equivalent to <b>STAILQ_CONCAT</b>().
