       mh-draft - draft folder facility for mmh

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       There are a number of interesting advanced facilities for the composition of outgoing mail.

   <b>The</b> <b>Draft</b> <b>Folder</b>
       The <b>comp</b>, <b>dist</b>, <b>forw</b>, and <b>repl</b> commands allow you to manipulate various draft messages simultanely

       Draft  messages are created in the draft folder.  (The `<u>Draft-Folder</u>' profile entry may be used to change
       the default draft folder.

       New drafts are created unless the user invokes <b>comp</b> with <b>-use</b>, in which case the current draft is used.

       The last draft message the user was composing is the current message in the draft folder.

       The user can send off whatever drafts desired from the shell using the standard <b>mmh</b> `msgs' convention  to
       the <b>send</b> command:

              send f

       If no `msgs' are given, the current message is used.

       To make all this a bit more clear, here are some examples:

       Any of the commands

            comp
            dist
            forw
            repl

       constructs  the  message  draft in the draft folder using the `b' message number.  Furthermore, they each
       define `c' in this folder to be that message draft.  If the user were to use the  <b>quit</b>  option  at  `What
       now?' level, then later on, if no other draft composition was done, the draft could be sent with simply

            send

       Or, if more editing was required, the draft could be edited with

            comp -use

       Instead,  if  other  drafts  had  been composed in the meantime, so that this message draft was no longer
       known as `c' in the `draft' folder, then the user could <b>scan</b> the folder to see which message draft in the
       folder should be used for editing or sending.  Clever users could even employ a back-quoted  <b>pick</b>  to  do
       the work:

            comp -use `pick +drafts -to nmh-workers`

       or

            send `pick +drafts -to nmh-workers`

       Note  that  in the <b>comp</b> example, the output from <b>pick</b> must resolve to a single message draft (it makes no
       sense to talk about composing two or more drafts with one invocation of <b>comp</b>).  In contrast, in the  <b>send</b>
       example,  as  many  message  drafts  as desired can appear, since <b>send</b> doesn't mind sending more than one
       draft at a time.

       It is important to realize that <b>mmh</b> treats the draft folder like a standard <b>MH</b> folder.
