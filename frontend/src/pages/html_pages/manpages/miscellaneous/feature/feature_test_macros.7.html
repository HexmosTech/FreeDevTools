       feature_test_macros - feature test macros

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Feature  test  macros  allow  the programmer to control the definitions that are exposed by system header
       files when a program is compiled.

       <b>NOTE:</b> In order to be effective, a feature test macro <u>must</u> <u>be</u> <u>defined</u> <u>before</u> <u>including</u> <u>any</u>  <u>header</u>  <u>files</u>.
       This can be done either in the compilation command (<u>cc</u> <u>-DMACRO=value</u>) or by defining the macro within the
       source  code  before  including  any  headers.   The  requirement  that  the macro must be defined before
       including any header file exists because header files may freely include one another.  Thus, for example,
       in the following lines, defining the <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b> macro may have no  effect  because  the  header  <u>&lt;abc.h&gt;</u>
       itself includes <u>&lt;xyz.h&gt;</u> (POSIX explicitly allows this):

           #include &lt;abc.h&gt;
           #define _GNU_SOURCE
           #include &lt;xyz.h&gt;

       Some  feature  test  macros  are  useful  for  creating  portable applications, by preventing nonstandard
       definitions from being exposed.  Other macros can be used to expose nonstandard definitions that are  not
       exposed by default.

       The  precise  effects of each of the feature test macros described below can be ascertained by inspecting
       the <u>&lt;features.h&gt;</u> header file.  <b>Note</b>: applications do <u>not</u> need to directly include  <u>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/features.h">features.h</a>&gt;</u>;  indeed,
       doing so is actively discouraged.  See NOTES.

   <b>Specification</b> <b>of</b> <b>feature</b> <b>test</b> <b>macro</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>in</b> <b>manual</b> <b>pages</b>
       When  a  function  requires  that  a  feature  test  macro is defined, the manual page SYNOPSIS typically
       includes a note of the following form (this example from the <b><a href="../man2/acct.2.html">acct</a></b>(2) manual page):

              <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;</b>

              <b>int</b> <b>acct(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>filename</u><b>);</b>

          Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
          <b><a href="../man7/feature_test_macros.7.html">feature_test_macros</a></b>(7)):

              <b>acct</b>(): _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE &lt; 500)

       The <b>||</b> means that in order to obtain the declaration of <b><a href="../man2/acct.2.html">acct</a></b>(2) from <u>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</u>, <u>either</u> of the  following
       macro definitions must be made before including any header files:

           #define _BSD_SOURCE
           #define _XOPEN_SOURCE        /* or any value &lt; 500 */

       Alternatively, equivalent definitions can be included in the compilation command:

           cc -D_BSD_SOURCE
           cc -D_XOPEN_SOURCE           # Or any value &lt; 500

       Note that, as described below, <b>some</b> <b>feature</b> <b>test</b> <b>macros</b> <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> <b>default</b>, so that it may not always
       be necessary to explicitly specify the feature test macro(s) shown in the SYNOPSIS.

       In  a  few  cases,  manual pages use a shorthand for expressing the feature test macro requirements (this
       example from <b><a href="../man2/readahead.2.html">readahead</a></b>(2)):

           <b>#define</b> <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b>
           <b>#define</b> <b>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS</b> <b>64</b>
           <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/fcntl.h">fcntl.h</a>&gt;</b>

           <b>ssize_t</b> <b>readahead(int</b> <u>fd</u><b>,</b> <b>off_t</b> <b>*</b><u>offset</u><b>,</b> <b>size_t</b> <u>count</u><b>);</b>

       This format is employed when the feature test macros ensure that the  proper  function  declarations  are
       visible, and the macros are not defined by default.

   <b>Feature</b> <b>test</b> <b>macros</b> <b>understood</b> <b>by</b> <b>glibc</b>
       The paragraphs below explain how feature test macros are handled in glibc 2.<u>x</u>, <u>x</u> &gt; 0.

       First, though, a summary of a few details for the impatient:

       •  The macros that you most likely need to use in modern source code are <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b> (for definitions
          from  various  versions  of  POSIX.1),  <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>  (for definitions from various versions of SUS),
          <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b> (for GNU and/or Linux specific stuff), and <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b> (to get definitions that  would
          normally be provided by default).

       •  Certain macros are defined with default values.  Thus, although one or more macros may be indicated as
          being required in the SYNOPSIS of a man page, it may not be necessary to define them explicitly.  Full
          details of the defaults are given later in this man page.

       •  Defining  <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>  with  a  value  of  600  or  greater  produces  the  same effects as defining
          <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b> with a value of 200112L or greater.  Where one sees

              _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L

          in the feature test macro requirements in the SYNOPSIS  of  a  man  page,  it  is  implicit  that  the
          following has the same effect:

              _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600

       •  Defining  <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>  with  a  value  of  700  or  greater  produces  the  same effects as defining
          <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b> with a value of 200809L or greater.  Where one sees

              _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200809L

          in the feature test macro requirements in the SYNOPSIS  of  a  man  page,  it  is  implicit  that  the
          following has the same effect:

              _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 700

       glibc understands the following feature test macros:

       <b>__STRICT_ANSI__</b>
              ISO  Standard  C.   This macro is implicitly defined by <b><a href="../man1/gcc.1.html">gcc</a></b>(1) when invoked with, for example, the
              <u>-std=c99</u> or <u>-ansi</u> flag.

       <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b>
              Defining this macro causes header files to expose definitions as follows:

              •  The value 1 exposes definitions conforming to POSIX.1-1990 and ISO C (1990).

              •  The value 2 or greater additionally exposes definitions for POSIX.2-1992.

              •  The  value  199309L  or  greater  additionally  exposes  definitions  for  POSIX.1b  (real-time
                 extensions).

              •  The value 199506L or greater additionally exposes definitions for POSIX.1c (threads).

              •  (Since glibc 2.3.3) The value 200112L or greater additionally exposes definitions corresponding
                 to  the  POSIX.1-2001 base specification (excluding the XSI extension).  This value also causes
                 C95 (since glibc 2.12) and C99 (since glibc 2.10) features to be exposed (in other  words,  the
                 equivalent of defining <b>_ISOC99_SOURCE</b>).

              •  (Since  glibc 2.10) The value 200809L or greater additionally exposes definitions corresponding
                 to the POSIX.1-2008 base specification (excluding the XSI extension).

       <b>_POSIX_SOURCE</b>
              Defining this obsolete macro with any value is equivalent to  defining  <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b>  with  the
              value 1.

              Since  this  macro is obsolete, its usage is generally not documented when discussing feature test
              macro requirements in the man pages.

       <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>
              Defining this macro causes header files to expose definitions as follows:

              •  Defining with any value exposes definitions conforming to POSIX.1, POSIX.2, and XPG4.

              •  The value 500 or greater additionally exposes definitions for SUSv2 (UNIX 98).

              •  (Since glibc 2.2) The value 600 or greater additionally exposes definitions for SUSv3 (UNIX 03;
                 i.e., the POSIX.1-2001 base specification plus the XSI extension) and C99 definitions.

              •  (Since glibc 2.10) The value 700 or greater additionally exposes definitions for  SUSv4  (i.e.,
                 the POSIX.1-2008 base specification plus the XSI extension).

              If  <b>__STRICT_ANSI__</b> is not defined, or <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b> is defined with a value greater than or equal
              to 500 <u>and</u> neither <b>_POSIX_SOURCE</b> nor <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b> is explicitly  defined,  then  the  following
              macros are implicitly defined:

              •  <b>_POSIX_SOURCE</b> is defined with the value 1.

              •  <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b> is defined, according to the value of <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>:

                 <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b> &lt; 500
                        <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b> is defined with the value 2.

                 500 &lt;= <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b> &lt; 600
                        <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b> is defined with the value 199506L.

                 600 &lt;= <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b> &lt; 700
                        <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b> is defined with the value 200112L.

                 700 &lt;= <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b> (since glibc 2.10)
                        <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b> is defined with the value 200809L.

              In  addition,  defining  <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b> with a value of 500 or greater produces the same effects as
              defining <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b>.

       <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b>
              If this macro is defined, <u>and</u> <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b> is defined, then expose definitions  corresponding  to
              the  XPG4v2 (SUSv1) UNIX extensions (UNIX 95).  Defining <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b> with a value of 500 or more
              also produces the same effect as defining <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b>.  Use  of  <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b>
              in new source code should be avoided.

              Since  defining  <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>  with  a  value  of  500  or  more  has the same effect as defining
              <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b>, the latter (obsolete) feature test macro is generally not described in the
              SYNOPSIS in man pages.

       <b>_ISOC99_SOURCE</b> (since glibc 2.1.3)
              Exposes declarations consistent with the ISO C99 standard.

              Earlier glibc 2.1.x versions recognized an equivalent macro named <b>_ISOC9X_SOURCE</b> (because the  C99
              standard  had  not  then  been  finalized).   Although  the  use  of this macro is obsolete, glibc
              continues to recognize it for backward compatibility.

              Defining <b>_ISOC99_SOURCE</b> also exposes ISO C (1990) Amendment 1 ("C95") definitions.   (The  primary
              change in C95 was support for international character sets.)

              Invoking the C compiler with the option <u>-std=c99</u> produces the same effects as defining this macro.

       <b>_ISOC11_SOURCE</b> (since glibc 2.16)
              Exposes  declarations  consistent with the ISO C11 standard.  Defining this macro also enables C99
              and C95 features (like <b>_ISOC99_SOURCE</b>).

              Invoking the C compiler with the option <u>-std=c11</u> produces the same effects as defining this macro.

       <b>_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE</b>
              Expose definitions for the alternative  API  specified  by  the  LFS  (Large  File  Summit)  as  a
              "transitional  extension"  to  the  Single UNIX Specification.  (See <a href="http://opengroup.org/platform">http://opengroup.org/platform</a>
              /lfs.html.)  The alternative API consists of a set of new  objects  (i.e.,  functions  and  types)
              whose  names  are suffixed with "64" (e.g., <u>off64_t</u> versus <u>off_t</u>, <b>lseek64</b>() versus <b>lseek</b>(), etc.).
              New programs should not employ this macro; instead <b>_</b><u>FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64</u> should be employed.

       <b>_LARGEFILE_SOURCE</b>
              This macro  was  historically  used  to  expose  certain  functions  (specifically  <b><a href="../man3/fseeko.3.html">fseeko</a></b>(3)  and
              <b><a href="../man3/ftello.3.html">ftello</a></b>(3)) that address limitations of earlier APIs (<b><a href="../man3/fseek.3.html">fseek</a></b>(3) and <b><a href="../man3/ftell.3.html">ftell</a></b>(3)) that use <u>long</u> for file
              offsets.   This  macro is implicitly defined if <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b> is defined with a value greater than
              or equal to 500.  New programs should not  employ  this  macro;  defining  <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>  as  just
              described  or  defining  <b>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS</b> with the value 64 is the preferred mechanism to achieve
              the same result.

       <b>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS</b>
              Defining this macro with the value 64 automatically converts references to  32-bit  functions  and
              data  types  related  to  file  I/O  and  filesystem  operations  into  references to their 64-bit
              counterparts.  This is useful for performing I/O on large files (&gt; 2 Gigabytes) on 32-bit systems.
              It is also useful when calling functions like <b><a href="../man2/copy_file_range.2.html">copy_file_range</a></b>(2) that were added more recently and
              that come only in 64-bit flavors.  (Defining this macro permits correctly written programs to  use
              large files with only a recompilation being required.)

              64-bit  systems  naturally  permit  file sizes greater than 2 Gigabytes, and on those systems this
              macro has no effect.

       <b>_TIME_BITS</b>
              Defining this macro with the value 64 changes the width of <b><a href="../man3type/time_t.3type.html">time_t</a></b>(3type) to  64-bit  which  allows
              handling  of  timestamps beyond 2038.  It is closely related to <b>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS</b> and depending on
              implementation, may require it set.  This macro is available as of glibc 2.34.

       <b>_BSD_SOURCE</b> (deprecated since glibc 2.20)
              Defining this macro with any value causes header files to expose BSD-derived definitions.

              In glibc versions up to and including 2.18, defining this macro also causes BSD definitions to  be
              preferred  in  some  situations  where  standards  conflict,  unless  one or more of <b>_SVID_SOURCE</b>,
              <b>_POSIX_SOURCE</b>, <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b>, <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>, <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b>, or <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b> is  defined,
              in  which case BSD definitions are disfavored.  Since glibc 2.19, <b>_BSD_SOURCE</b> no longer causes BSD
              definitions to be preferred in case of conflicts.

              Since  glibc  2.20,  this  macro  is  deprecated.   It  now  has  the  same  effect  as   defining
              <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b>,  but  generates  a compile-time warning (unless <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b> is also defined).
              Use <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b> instead.  To allow code that requires <b>_BSD_SOURCE</b> in glibc  2.19  and  earlier
              and  <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b>  in glibc 2.20 and later to compile without warnings, define <u>both</u> <b>_BSD_SOURCE</b>
              and <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b>.

       <b>_SVID_SOURCE</b> (deprecated since glibc 2.20)
              Defining this macro with any value causes header files to  expose  System  V-derived  definitions.
              (SVID == System V Interface Definition; see <b><a href="../man7/standards.7.html">standards</a></b>(7).)

              Since glibc 2.20, this macro is deprecated in the same fashion as <b>_BSD_SOURCE</b>.

       <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b> (since glibc 2.19)
              This  macro  can  be  defined  to ensure that the "default" definitions are provided even when the
              defaults would otherwise be disabled, as happens when individual macros are explicitly defined, or
              the  compiler  is  invoked  in  one  of  its  "standard"  modes  (e.g.,  <u>cc</u>  <u>-std=c99</u>).   Defining
              <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b>  without  defining  other individual macros or invoking the compiler in one of its
              "standard" modes has no effect.

              The "default" definitions comprise those required by POSIX.1-2008 and ISO C99, as well as  various
              definitions  originally  derived from BSD and System V.  On glibc 2.19 and earlier, these defaults
              were approximately equivalent to explicitly defining the following:

                  cc -D_BSD_SOURCE -D_SVID_SOURCE -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809

       <b>_ATFILE_SOURCE</b> (since glibc 2.4)
              Defining this macro with any value causes header files  to  expose  declarations  of  a  range  of
              functions  with  the  suffix "at"; see <b><a href="../man2/openat.2.html">openat</a></b>(2).  Since glibc 2.10, this macro is also implicitly
              defined if <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b> is defined with a value greater than or equal to 200809L.

       <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b>
              Defining this macro (with  any  value)  implicitly  defines  <b>_ATFILE_SOURCE</b>,  <b>_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE</b>,
              <b>_ISOC99_SOURCE</b>,  <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b>,  <b>_POSIX_SOURCE</b>,  <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b>  with  the value 200809L
              (200112L before glibc 2.10; 199506L before glibc 2.5; 199309L before glibc 2.1) and  <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>
              with  the  value  700  (600  before  glibc 2.10; 500 before glibc 2.2).  In addition, various GNU-
              specific extensions are also exposed.

              Since glibc 2.19, defining <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b> also has the effect of implicitly defining <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b>.
              Before glibc 2.20, defining <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b> also had the effect of implicitly defining <b>_BSD_SOURCE</b> and
              <b>_SVID_SOURCE</b>.

       <b>_REENTRANT</b>
              Historically, on various C libraries it was necessary to define this macro  in  all  multithreaded
              code.   (Some  C libraries may still require this.)  In glibc, this macro also exposed definitions
              of certain reentrant functions.

              However, glibc has been thread-safe by default for many years; since glibc 2.3, the only effect of
              defining <b>_REENTRANT</b> has been to enable one or two of the same declarations that are  also  enabled
              by defining <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b> with a value of 199606L or greater.

              <b>_REENTRANT</b>  is  now  obsolete.   In  glibc  2.25  and  later, defining <b>_REENTRANT</b> is equivalent to
              defining <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b> with the value 199606L.  If a higher POSIX conformance level is  selected
              by   any   other  means  (such  as  <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b>  itself,  <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>,  <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b>,  or
              <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b>), then defining <b>_REENTRANT</b> has no effect.

              This macro is automatically defined if one compiles with <u>cc</u> <u>-pthread</u>.

       <b>_THREAD_SAFE</b>
              Synonym  for  the  (deprecated)  <b>_REENTRANT</b>,  provided   for   compatibility   with   some   other
              implementations.

       <b>_FORTIFY_SOURCE</b> (since glibc 2.3.4)
              Defining  this macro causes some lightweight checks to be performed to detect some buffer overflow
              errors when employing various string and memory manipulation functions  (for  example,  <b><a href="../man3/memcpy.3.html">memcpy</a></b>(3),
              <b><a href="../man3/memset.3.html">memset</a></b>(3),  <b><a href="../man3/stpcpy.3.html">stpcpy</a></b>(3),  <b><a href="../man3/strcpy.3.html">strcpy</a></b>(3),  <b><a href="../man3/strncpy.3.html">strncpy</a></b>(3),  <b><a href="../man3/strcat.3.html">strcat</a></b>(3),  <b><a href="../man3/strncat.3.html">strncat</a></b>(3),  <b><a href="../man3/sprintf.3.html">sprintf</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/snprintf.3.html">snprintf</a></b>(3),
              <b><a href="../man3/vsprintf.3.html">vsprintf</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/vsnprintf.3.html">vsnprintf</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/gets.3.html">gets</a></b>(3), and wide character variants  thereof).   For  some  functions,
              argument  consistency is checked; for example, a check is made that <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2) has been supplied with
              a <u>mode</u> argument when the specified flags include <b>O_CREAT</b>.  Not all  problems  are  detected,  just
              some common cases.

              If  <b>_FORTIFY_SOURCE</b>  is  set  to 1, with compiler optimization level 1 (<u>gcc</u> <u>-O1</u>) and above, checks
              that shouldn't change the behavior of conforming programs are performed.  With <b>_FORTIFY_SOURCE</b> set
              to 2, some more checking is added, but some conforming programs might fail.

              Some of the checks can be performed at compile  time  (via  macros  logic  implemented  in  header
              files), and result in compiler warnings; other checks take place at run time, and result in a run-
              time error if the check fails.

              With  <b>_FORTIFY_SOURCE</b> set to 3, additional checking is added to intercept some function calls used
              with an argument of variable size where the compiler can deduce an upper bound for its value.  For
              example, a program where <b><a href="../man3/malloc.3.html">malloc</a></b>(3)'s size argument is variable can now be fortified.

              Use of this macro requires compiler support, available since  gcc  4.0  and  clang  2.6.   Use  of
              <b>_FORTIFY_SOURCE</b>  set  to  3 requires gcc 12.0 or later, or clang 9.0 or later, in conjunction with
              glibc 2.33 or later.

   <b>Default</b> <b>definitions,</b> <b>implicit</b> <b>definitions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>combining</b> <b>definitions</b>
       If no feature test macros are explicitly defined, then the following feature test macros are  defined  by
       default:   <b>_BSD_SOURCE</b>   (in  glibc  2.19  and  earlier),  <b>_SVID_SOURCE</b>  (in  glibc  2.19  and  earlier),
       <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b> (since glibc 2.19), <b>_POSIX_SOURCE</b>,  and  <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b>=200809L  (200112L  before  glibc
       2.10; 199506L before glibc 2.4; 199309L before glibc 2.1).

       If   any   of   <b>__STRICT_ANSI__</b>,   <b>_ISOC99_SOURCE</b>,  <b>_ISOC11_SOURCE</b>  (since  glibc  2.18),  <b>_POSIX_SOURCE</b>,
       <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b>, <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>, <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b> (in glibc 2.11 and earlier), <b>_BSD_SOURCE</b> (in glibc
       2.19 and earlier), or <b>_SVID_SOURCE</b> (in glibc 2.19 and earlier) is explicitly defined,  then  <b>_BSD_SOURCE</b>,
       <b>_SVID_SOURCE</b>, and <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b> are not defined by default.

       If  <b>_POSIX_SOURCE</b>  and  <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b>  are  not  explicitly  defined, and either <b>__STRICT_ANSI__</b> is not
       defined or <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b> is defined with a value of 500 or more, then

       •  <b>_POSIX_SOURCE</b> is defined with the value 1; and

       •  <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b> is defined with one of the following values:

          •  2, if <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b> is defined with a value less than 500;

          •  199506L, if <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b> is defined with a value greater than or equal to 500 and less  than  600;
             or

          •  (since  glibc  2.4)  200112L, if <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b> is defined with a value greater than or equal to 600
             and less than 700.

          •  (Since glibc 2.10) 200809L, if <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b> is defined with a value greater than or equal to 700.

          •  Older versions of glibc do not know about the values 200112L and 200809L for  <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b>,  and
             the setting of this macro will depend on the glibc version.

          •  If  <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>  is  undefined, then the setting of <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b> depends on the glibc version:
             199506L, before glibc 2.4; 200112L, since glibc 2.4 to glibc 2.9; and 200809L, since glibc 2.10.

       Multiple macros can be defined; the results are additive.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.1 specifies <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b>, <b>_POSIX_SOURCE</b>, and <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>.

       <b>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS</b> is not specified by any standard, but is employed on some other implementations.

       <b>_BSD_SOURCE</b>, <b>_SVID_SOURCE</b>, <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b>, <b>_ATFILE_SOURCE</b>, <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b>, <b>_FORTIFY_SOURCE</b>, <b>_REENTRANT</b>, and
       <b>_THREAD_SAFE</b> are specific to glibc.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b> was specified by XPG4v2 (aka SUSv1), but is not present in SUSv2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>&lt;features.h&gt;</u> is a Linux/glibc-specific header file.  Other systems have an analogous file, but  typically
       with  a different name.  This header file is automatically included by other header files as required: it
       is not necessary to explicitly include it in order to employ feature test macros.

       According to which of the above feature test macros are defined, <u>&lt;features.h&gt;</u> internally defines  various
       other  macros  that  are  checked  by  other glibc header files.  These macros have names prefixed by two
       underscores (e.g., <b>__USE_MISC</b>).  Programs  should  <u>never</u>  define  these  macros  directly:  instead,  the
       appropriate feature test macro(s) from the list above should be employed.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  below  can  be used to explore how the various feature test macros are set depending on the
       glibc version and what feature test macros are explicitly set.  The following shell session, on a  system
       with glibc 2.10, shows some examples of what we would see:
