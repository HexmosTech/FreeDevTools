   <b>ExtractVersion</b>
       Extracts version numbers from a version string:

          extract_version (&lt;name&gt; [REVERSE_NAME])

       Tries to extract the following variables (the second version is used if REVERSE_NAME is set as argument):

          &lt;name&gt;_MAJOR_VERSION or &lt;name&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR - &lt;name&gt; major version
          &lt;name&gt;_MINOR_VERSION or &lt;name&gt;_VERSION_MINOR - &lt;name&gt; minor version
          &lt;name&gt;_PATCH_VERSION or &lt;name&gt;_VERSION_PATCH - &lt;name&gt; patch version
          &lt;name&gt;_TWEAK_VERSION or &lt;name&gt;_VERSION_TWEAK - &lt;name&gt; tweak version

              wrappers, etc.), but can be enabled if required.

   <b>IncludeUrl</b>
       Adds the <u>include_url()</u> command that useful to download and include other CMake modules from a given url.

       <b>include_url</b>

       Downloads a file from given url and includes it:

          include_url(&lt;url&gt;                 # Url to be downloaded
             [DESTINATION &lt;destination&gt;]    # Where the file will be saved
             [EXPECTED_HASH &lt;ALGO=value&gt;]   # Verify downloaded file's hash
             [EXPECTED_MD5 &lt;sum&gt;]           # Short-hand for "EXPECTED_HASH MD5=sum"
             [DOWNLOAD_ONCE]                # Download the file only once
             [DOWNLOAD_ALWAYS]              # Download the file every time
             [OPTIONAL]                     # Do not fail file cannot be included
             [RESULT_VARIABLE &lt;variable&gt;]   # The local path for the file included
             [RETRIES &lt;retries&gt;]            # Try download &lt;retries&gt; times (default 3)
             [QUIET]                        # Don't print anything
            #--Download arguments-----------
             [INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT &lt;timeout&gt;] # Timeout after &lt;timeout&gt; seconds of inactivity
             [TIMEOUT &lt;timeout&gt;]            # Timeout after &lt;timeout&gt; seconds
             [STATUS &lt;status&gt;]              # Download status variable
             [LOG &lt;log&gt;]                    # Download log variable
             [SHOW_PROGRESS]                # Show download progress
             [TLS_VERIFY &lt;on|off&gt;]          # Check certificates
             [TLS_CAINFO &lt;file&gt;]            # Custom Certificate Authority file
            #--Include arguments------------
             [NO_POLICY_SCOPE]              # Do not manage a new policy entry
             )

       The <b>include_url</b> macro downloads a file from given url and includes it.  It works both in -P  script  mode
       and when configuring a CMakeLists.txt file.

       If  <b>DESTINATION</b>  is  specified,  the file is saved at the given location with the original  file name, if
       <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b> is a directory, or with the given file  name, if <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b> is a file name.

       The arguments <b>EXPECTED_HASH</b>, <b>EXPECTED_MD5</b> are used to ensure that the file included is the one  expected.
       If  the  <b>&lt;url&gt;</b>  is  a local file (i.e.  starts with <b>file://</b>) the hash check is performed also on the file
       converted to the non-native end-of-line style.  See the documentation of the <b>file()</b> command  for  further
       information about these arguments.

       If  the  <b>DOWNLOAD_ONCE</b> option is specified, the file is not downloaded if the file already exists and the
       hash is correct.  If the <b>DOWNLOAD_ALWAYS</b> option is specified, the  file  is  downloaded  at  every  CMake
       execution,  and  an  error  is  raised on failure.  If none of these two option is specifies, the default
       behaviour is to try to download the file at every CMake execution, but no error is raised if the download
       fails if a version of the file already exists. This is useful when CMake should try to update the file to
       the latest version, before including it.

       If the <b>OPTIONAL</b> option is specified, no error will be caused  if  for  any  reason  the  file  cannot  be
       downloaded or included.  If <b>RESULT_VARIABLE</b> is given, the variable will be set to the full filename which
       has  been  downloaded and included or NOTFOUND if it failed.  See the documentation of the <b>file()</b> command
       for further information about these arguments.

       If the <b>RETRIES</b> option is specified, the download will be tried If the  <b>QUIET</b>  option  is  specified,  the
       command will emit no output.

       The  arguments  <b>INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT</b>,  <b>TIMEOUT</b>,  <b>STATUS</b>, <b>LOG</b>, <b>SHOW_PROGRESS</b>, <b>TLS_VERIFY</b>, and <b>TLS_CAINFO</b> are
       passed to the <b>file(DOWNLOAD)</b> command.  See the  documentation  of  the  <b>file()</b>  command  for  a  detailed
       description of these arguments.

       The arguments <b>NO_POLICY_SCOPE</b> is passed to the <b>include()</b> command.  See the documentation of the <b>include()</b>
       and <b>cmake_policy()</b> commands for a detailed description of this argument.

   <b>ReplaceImportedTargets</b>
       Adds  the  <u>replace_imported_targets()</u>  command that useful to replace paths with imported targets in link
       variables (like <b>&lt;FOO&gt;_LIBRARIES</b>) and targets.

       <b>replace_imported_targets</b>

       Replace imported targets in a list of and targets and paths:

          replace_imported_targets(&lt;var&gt; [target [target [...]]])

       Each path in <b>var</b> corrisponding to one of the <b>targets</b> will be  replaced  with  the  corrisponding  <b>target</b>,
       taking care to remove the relative <b>optimized</b> and <b>debug</b> keywords.

       For  each  existing  target  in  <b>var</b>, the following properties will be searched for imported locations of
       targets, and, if set, will be replaced in the same way:

          IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES
          IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
          IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
          IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
          INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES
          LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
          LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
          LINK_LIBRARIES

   <b>StandardFindModule</b>
       Try to find a package using a cmake config file, or pkgconfig:

          standard_find_module(&lt;name&gt;
                               &lt;pkgconfig name&gt;
                               [NOT_REQUIRED]
                               [QUIET]
                               [SKIP_CMAKE_CONFIG]
                               [SKIP_PKG_CONFIG]
                               [TARGET &lt;target&gt;]
                               [REPLACE_TARGETS &lt;target&gt; [...]]
          )

       If the package is found, the following variables (where possible) are created:

          &lt;name&gt;_FOUND         - System has &lt;name&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;_INCLUDE_DIRS  - &lt;name&gt; include directory
          &lt;name&gt;_LIBRARIES     - &lt;name&gt; libraries
          &lt;name&gt;_DEFINITIONS   - Additional compiler flags for &lt;name&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;_VERSION       - &lt;name&gt; version
          &lt;name&gt;_MAJOR_VERSION - &lt;name&gt; major version
          &lt;name&gt;_MINOR_VERSION - &lt;name&gt; minor version
          &lt;name&gt;_PATCH_VERSION - &lt;name&gt; patch version
          &lt;name&gt;_TWEAK_VERSION - &lt;name&gt; tweak version
          &lt;name&gt;_VERSION_COUNT - Number of version components, 0 to 4

       For each library that requires to be linked (i.e. <b>-llib</b>) it creates:

          &lt;name&gt;_&lt;LIB&gt;_LIBRARY_RELEASE (cached, advanced)
          &lt;name&gt;_&lt;LIB&gt;_LIBRARY_DEBUG (cached, advanced, and empty by default)
          &lt;name&gt;_&lt;LIB&gt;_LIBRARY
          &lt;name&gt;_&lt;LIB&gt;_LIBRARY_FOUND

       In a <b>FindXXX.cmake</b> module, this macro can be used at the beginning.  The <b>NOT_REQUIRED</b>  can  be  added  to
       avoid  failing if the package was not found, but <b>pkg-config</b> is installed.  The <b>QUIET</b> argument can be used
       to hide the output from <u>find_package_handle_standard_args</u>.  If <b>&lt;name&gt;_FOUND</b> is <b>FALSE</b>  at  the  end,  more
       “custom” searches can be used (for windows, etc.)

       If <b>SKIP_CMAKE_CONFIG</b> or <b>SKIP_PKG_CONFIG</b> are set, the relative step is skipped

       If  <b>TARGET</b>  is  specified, in <b>pkg-config</b> mode, an imported target will be created using the first library
       returned by <b>pkg-config</b> as imported location.

       The <b>REPLACE_TARGETS</b> can be used to pass a list of imported targets that will be detected in variables and
       target properties, and replaced with the corresponding target.

       If one of the <b>STANDARD_FIND_MODULE_USE_IMPORTED_TARGET</b> or <b>STANDARD_FIND_MODULE_USE_IMPORTED_TARGET_&lt;name&gt;</b>
       are enabled, and a <b>TARGET</b> is specified, the  <b>&lt;name&gt;_LIBRARIES</b>  variable  content  is  replaced  with  the
       imported target.

       If  one  of  the  variables  <b>STANDARD_FIND_MODULE_DEBUG</b>  or <b>STANDARD_FIND_MODULE_DEBUG_&lt;name&gt;</b> is enabled,
       prints more useful debug output

                                     )

       Depending on <b>UPPERCASE_FILENAMES</b> and <b>LOWERCASE_FILENAMES</b>, this function generates 3 files:

          • <b>&lt;Name&gt;ConfigVersion.cmake</b> or <b>&lt;name&gt;-config-version.cmake</b>

          • <b>&lt;Name&gt;Config.cmake</b> or <b>&lt;name&gt;-config.cmake</b>

          • <b>&lt;Name&gt;Targets.cmake</b> or <b>&lt;name&gt;-targets.cmake</b>

       If  neither  <b>UPPERCASE_FILENAMES</b>  nor  <b>LOWERCASE_FILENAMES</b>  is  set,  a  file  <b>&lt;Name&gt;Config.cmake.in</b>   or
       <b>&lt;name&gt;-config.cmake.in</b>  is searched, and the convention is chosed according to the file found. If no file
       was found, the uppercase convention is used.

       The <b>DEPENDENCIES</b> argument can be used to set a list of dependencies  that  will  be  searched  using  the
       <b>find_dependency()</b>  command from the <b>CMakeFindDependencyMacro</b> module.  Dependencies can be followed by any
       of the possible <b>find_dependency()</b> argument.  In this case, all the arguments  must  be  specified  within
       double  quotes  (e.g.   <b>"&lt;dependency&gt;</b>  <b>1.0.0</b> <b>EXACT"</b>, or <b>"&lt;dependency&gt;</b> <b>CONFIG"</b>).  The <b>PRIVATE_DEPENDENCIES</b>
       argument is similar to <b>DEPENDENCIES</b>, but these dependencies are included only when  <b>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</b>  is
       <b>OFF</b>.   If  a  libraries  is declared <b>STATIC</b>, <b>OBJECT</b> or <b>INTERFACE</b>, and they link to some dependency, these
       should be added using the <b>DEPENDENCIES</b> argument, since the <b>PRIVATE_DEPENDENCIES</b> argument would work  only
       when <b>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</b> is disabled.

       When  using  a custom template file, the <b>@PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES@</b> string is replaced with the code checking
       for the dependencies specified by these two argument.

       If the <b>ARCH_INDEPENDENT</b> option is enabled, the installed package version will  be  considered  compatible
       even if it was built for a different architecture than the requested architecture.

       Each  file  is  generated twice, one for the build directory and one for the installation directory.  The
       <b>INSTALL_DESTINATION</b> argument can be passed to install the files in a location different from the  default
       one    (<b>${CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR}/cmake/${Name}</b>    if    the    <b>ARCH_INDEPENDENT</b>    option   is   enabled,
       <b>${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/cmake/${Name}</b> otherwise).  The  <b>EXPORT_DESTINATION</b>  argument  can  be  passed  to
       generate the files in the build tree in a location different from the default one (<b>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</b>).  If
       this is a relative path, it is considered relative to the <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</b> directory.

       The   build   directory   is   exported   to  the  CMake  user  package  registry  if  the  build  option
       <b>CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY</b> is set.

       The <b>&lt;Name&gt;ConfigVersion.cmake</b> file is generated using  <b>write_basic_package_version_file()</b>.  The  <b>VERSION</b>,
       <b>COMPATIBILITY</b>, and
       ``
       ARCH_INDEPENDENT``arguments are passed to this function.

       <b>VERSION</b>  shall  be  in  the  form  <b>&lt;major&gt;[.&lt;minor&gt;[.&lt;patch&gt;[.&lt;tweak&gt;]]]]</b>.   If  no <b>VERSION</b> is given, the
       <b>PROJECT_VERSION</b> variable is used.  If this hasn’t been set, it errors out.  The <b>VERSION</b> argument is  also
       used to replace the <b>@PACKAGE_VERSION@</b> string in the configuration file.

       <b>COMPATIBILITY</b>  shall  be  any  of  the options accepted by the <b>write_basic_package_version_file()</b> command
       (<b>AnyNewerVersion</b>, <b>SameMajorVersion</b>, <b>SameMinorVersion</b> [CMake 3.11], or <b>ExactVersion</b>).  These  options  are
       explained  in  <b>write_basic_package_version_file()</b>  command  documentation.   If  your  project  has  more
       elaborate version matching rules, you will need to write your own custom ConfigVersion.cmake file instead
       of using this macro.

       The    <b>&lt;Name&gt;Config.cmake</b>    file    is    generated    using    <b>configure_package_config_file()</b>.     The
       <b>NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO</b>, <b>NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS_MACRO</b>, and arguments are passed to this function.

       By  default  <u>install_basic_package_files()</u>  also  generates  the  two  helper  macros <b>set_and_check()</b> and
       <b>check_required_components()</b> into the <b>&lt;Name&gt;Config.cmake</b> file. <b>set_and_check()</b> should be used  instead  of
       the  normal  <b>set()</b>  command  for  setting  directories  and  file locations.  Additionally to setting the
       variable it also checks that  the  referenced  file  or  directory  actually  exists  and  fails  with  a
       <b>FATAL_ERROR</b>  otherwise.   This makes sure that the created <b>&lt;Name&gt;Config.cmake</b> file does not contain wrong
       references.   When  using  the  <b>NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO,</b>  <b>this</b>   <b>macro</b>   <b>is</b>   <b>not</b>   <b>generated</b>   <b>into</b>   <b>the</b>
       <b>``&lt;Name&gt;Config.cmake</b> file.

       By   default,   <u>install_basic_package_files()</u>  append  a  call  to  <b>check_required_components(&lt;Name&gt;)</b>  in
       <b>&lt;Name&gt;Config.cmake</b> file if the package supports components. This  macro  checks  whether  all  requested,
       non-optional  components  have been found, and if this is not the case, sets the <b>&lt;Name&gt;_FOUND</b> variable to
       <b>FALSE</b>,  so  that  the  package  is  considered  to  be  not  found.  It  does   that   by   testing   the
       <b>&lt;Name&gt;_&lt;Component&gt;_FOUND</b>   variables   for   all   requested   required   components.   When   using  the
       <b>NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS_MACRO</b> option, this macro is not generated into the <b>&lt;Name&gt;Config.cmake</b> file.

       Finally, the files in the build and install directory are exactly the same.

       See the documentation of <b>CMakePackageConfigHelpers</b> module for further information and references therein.

       If the <b>CONFIG_TEMPLATE</b> argument is passed, the specified file is used  as  template  for  generating  the
       configuration    file,   otherwise   this   module   expects   to   find   a   <b>&lt;Name&gt;Config.cmake.in</b>   or
       <b>&lt;name&gt;-config.cmake.in</b> file either in current source directory.  If the file does not exist, a very basic
       file is created.

       A set of variables are checked and passed to <b>configure_package_config_file()</b> as <b>PATH_VARS</b>.  For  each  of
       the <b>SUFFIX</b> considered, if one of the variables:

          &lt;VARS_PREFIX&gt;_(BUILD|INSTALL)_&lt;SUFFIX&gt;
          (BUILD|INSTALL)_&lt;VARS_PREFIX&gt;_&lt;SUFFIX&gt;

       is defined, the <b>&lt;VARS_PREFIX&gt;_&lt;SUFFIX&gt;</b> variable will be defined before configuring the package.  In order
       to use that variable in the config file, you have to add a line:

          set_and_check(&lt;VARS_PREFIX&gt;_&lt;SUFFIX&gt; \"@PACKAGE_&lt;VARS_PREFIX&gt;_&lt;SUFFIX&gt;@\")

       if the path must exist or just:

          set(&lt;VARS_PREFIX&gt;_&lt;SUFFIX&gt; \"@PACKAGE_&lt;VARS_PREFIX&gt;_&lt;SUFFIX&gt;@\")

       if the path could be missing.

       These  variable  will have different values whether you are using the package from the build tree or from
       the install directory.  Also these files will contain only relative paths, meaning that you can move  the
       whole installation and the CMake files will still work.

       Default <b>PATH_VARS</b> suffixes are:

          BINDIR          BIN_DIR
          SBINDIR         SBIN_DIR
          LIBEXECDIR      LIBEXEC_DIR
          SYSCONFDIR      SYSCONF_DIR
          SHAREDSTATEDIR  SHAREDSTATE_DIR
          LOCALSTATEDIR   LOCALSTATE_DIR
          LIBDIR          LIB_DIR
          INCLUDEDIR      INCLUDE_DIR
          OLDINCLUDEDIR   OLDINCLUDE_DIR
          DATAROOTDIR     DATAROOT_DIR
          DATADIR         DATA_DIR
          INFODIR         INFO_DIR
          LOCALEDIR       LOCALE_DIR
          MANDIR          MAN_DIR
          DOCDIR          DOC_DIR

       more suffixes can be added using the <b>EXTRA_PATH_VARS_SUFFIX</b> argument.

       The  <b>&lt;Name&gt;Targets.cmake</b>  is  generated using <b>export(EXPORT)</b> in the build tree and <b>install(EXPORT)</b> in the
       installation directory. The targets are exported using the value for the <b>NAMESPACE</b> argument as namespace.
       The export can be passed using the <b>EXPORT</b> argument. If no  export  is  used  (e.g.  for  a  CMake  script
       library), pass <b>NO_EXPORT</b>.

       If  the  <b>INCLUDE_FILE</b>  argument  is  passed,  the  content  of  the  specified  file (which might contain
       <b>@variables@</b>) is appended to the generated <b>&lt;Name&gt;Config.cmake</b> file.  If the  <b>INCLUDE_CONTENT</b>  argument  is
       passed,   the  specified  content  (which  might  contain  <b>@variables@</b>)  is  appended  to  the  generated
       <b>&lt;Name&gt;Config.cmake</b> file.  When a <b>CONFIG_TEMPLATE</b>  is  passed,  or  a  <b>&lt;Name&gt;ConfigVersion.cmake.in</b>  or  a
       <b>&lt;name&gt;-config-version.cmake.in</b>   <b>file</b>   <b>is</b>   <b>available,</b>  <b>these</b>  <b>2</b>  <b>arguments</b>  <b>are</b>  <b>used</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>replace</b>  <b>the</b>
       <b>``@INCLUDED_CONTENT@</b> string in this file.  This allows one to inject custom code  to  this  file,  useful
       e.g. to set additional variables which are loaded by downstream projects.

       Note  that  content  specified with <b>INCLUDE_FILE</b> or <b>INCLUDE_CONTENT</b> cannot reference any of the <b>PATH_VARS</b>
       because this content is not expanded by <b>configure_package_config_file()</b>.

       If the <b>COMPONENT</b> argument is passed, it is forwarded to the <b>install()</b> commands, otherwise <b>&lt;Name&gt;</b> is used.

   <b>AddUninstallTarget</b>
       Add the “uninstall” target for your project:

          include(AddUninstallTarget)

       will create a file <b>cmake_uninstall.cmake</b> in the build directory and add a  custom  target  <b>uninstall</b>  (or
       <b>UNINSTALL</b>  on  Visual  Studio  and  Xcode)  that  will  remove the files installed by your package (using
       <b>install_manifest.txt</b>).                                      See                                      also
       <u>https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/FAQ#can-i-do-make-uninstall-with-cmake</u>

       The <u>AddUninstallTarget</u> module must be included in your main <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>. If included in a subdirectory
       it  does  nothing.  This allows you to use it safely in your main <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> and include your project
       using <b>add_subdirectory</b> (for example when using it with <b>FetchContent</b>).

       If the <b>uninstall</b> target already exists, the module does nothing.

   <b>AddInstallRPATHSupport</b>
       Add support to RPATH during installation to the project and the targets

       <b>add_install_rpath_support</b>
              Add support to RPATH during installation to the project:

       <b>target_append_install_rpath</b>
              Add extra paths to RPATH for a specific target:

            target_append_install_rpath(&lt;target&gt;
                                        &lt;INSTALL_DESTINATION destination&gt;
                                        [LIB_DIRS dir [dir]]
                                        [DEPENDS condition [condition]])

          Arguments:
           - ``INSTALL_DESTINATION`` path where the target will be installed.
           - ``LIB_DIRS`` list of directories to be added to the RPATH. These
             directories will be added "relative" w.r.t. the ``INSTALL_DESTINATION``.
           - ``DEPENDS`` list of conditions that should be ``TRUE`` to enable
             RPATH, for example ``FOO; NOT BAR``.

</pre><h4><b>SUPERBUILD</b> <b>HELPER</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>FindOrBuildPackage</b>
       Searches for a package and builds it if it cannot be found.

       <b>find_or_build_package</b>

       Searches for a package and builds it if it cannot be found:

          find_or_build_package(&lt;PackageName&gt; &lt;find_package_args&gt;)

       This module tries to locate a package using <b>find_package()</b>.  If the package cannot be found it  tries  to
       build  it,  by  including <b>Build&lt;package&gt;</b>. This file should contain the instructions to download and build
       the package (for example using <u>ExternalProject</u>)

       The arguments passed to the function, are passed to the <b>find_package()</b> command.

       FIXME Figure out how to handle the REQUIRED and QUIET arguments

       If the package was found, the <b>USE_SYSTEM_&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> cached variable can be disabled in order to  force
       CMake  to build the package instead of using the one found on the system. To automatically force CMake to
       build all the packages that are also found  on the system, the <b>YCM_DISABLE_SYSTEM_PACKAGES</b> cache variable
       can be enabled.

       This function sets these variables:

          HAVE_SYSTEM_&lt;PackageName&gt; # The package was found on the system
          HAVE_&lt;PackageName&gt; # The package is available

       The user should use the  latest,  to  check  if  a  package  is  available,  instead  of  checking  using
       <b>&lt;PackageName&gt;_FOUND</b>. For example

       FIXME Check uppercase (${_PKG}) and lowercase (${_pkg}) variables

              find_or_build_package(Foo)
              if(HAVE_Foo)
                ...
              endif()

       <b>CMAKE_DISABLE_BUILD_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt;</b>

       Using  this  variable,  building  a  package is explicitly forbidden.  therefore if the package cannot be
       found on the system, the <b>HAVE_&lt;PackageName&gt;</b> will be set to false.

              The <b>ExternalProject_Add()</b> function creates  a  custom  target  to  drive  download,  update/patch,
              configure, build, install and test steps of an external project:

                 ExternalProject_Add(&lt;name&gt; [&lt;option&gt;...])

              The  individual  steps  within the process can be driven independently if required (e.g. for CDash
              submission) and extra custom steps can be defined, along with the  ability  to  control  the  step
              dependencies.  The directory structure used for the management of the external project can also be
              customized. The function supports a large number of options  which  can  be  used  to  tailor  the
              external project behavior.

              <b>Directory</b> <b>Options:</b>
                     Most  of  the  time,  the  default  directory  layout  is  sufficient.  It  is  largely  an
                     implementation detail that the main  project  usually  doesn’t  need  to  change.  In  some
                     circumstances,  however,  control over the directory layout can be useful or necessary. The
                     directory options are potentially more useful from the point of view that  the  main  build
                     can  use  the  <u>ExternalProject_Get_Property()</u>  command  to  retrieve  their values, thereby
                     allowing the main project to refer to build artifacts of the external project.

                     <b>PREFIX</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                            Root directory for the external project. Unless otherwise  noted  below,  all  other
                            directories associated with the external project will be created under here.

                     <b>TMP_DIR</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                            Directory in which to store temporary files.

                     <b>STAMP_DIR</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                            Directory  in  which to store the timestamps of each step. Log files from individual
                            steps are also created in here unless overriden  by  LOG_DIR  (see  <u>Logging</u>  <u>Options</u>
                            below).

                     <b>LOG_DIR</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                            Directory in which to store the logs of each step.

                     <b>DOWNLOAD_DIR</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                            Directory  in  which to store downloaded files before unpacking them. This directory
                            is only used by the URL download method, all other download methods  use  <b>SOURCE_DIR</b>
                            directly instead.

                     <b>SOURCE_DIR</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                            Source  directory  into  which  downloaded contents will be unpacked, or for non-URL
                            download methods, the directory in which  the  repository  should  be  checked  out,
                            cloned,  etc.  If  no  download  method is specified, this must point to an existing
                            directory where the external project has already  been  unpacked  or  cloned/checked
                            out.

                            <b>NOTE:</b>
                               If  a download method is specified, any existing contents of the source directory
                               may be deleted. Only the URL download method checks  whether  this  directory  is
                               either missing or empty before initiating the download, stopping with an error if
                               it  is  not  empty.  All  other  download  methods  silently discard any previous
                               contents of the source directory.

                     <b>BINARY_DIR</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                            Specify the build directory location. This option is ignored if  <b>BUILD_IN_SOURCE</b>  is
                            enabled.

                     <b>INSTALL_DIR</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                            Installation  prefix  to  be placed in the <b>&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;</b> placeholder.  This does not
                            actually configure the external project to install to the given prefix. That must be
                            done by passing appropriate arguments to the external  project  configuration  step,
                            e.g. using <b>&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;</b>.

                     If  any  of  the  above  <b>..._DIR</b>  options are not specified, their defaults are computed as
                     follows. If the <b>PREFIX</b> option is given or the <b>EP_PREFIX</b> directory property is set, then  an
                     external project is built and installed under the specified prefix:

                        TMP_DIR      = &lt;prefix&gt;<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>
                        STAMP_DIR    = &lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt;-stamp
                        DOWNLOAD_DIR = &lt;prefix&gt;/src
                        SOURCE_DIR   = &lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt;
                        BINARY_DIR   = &lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt;-build
                        INSTALL_DIR  = &lt;prefix&gt;
                        LOG_DIR      = &lt;STAMP_DIR&gt;

                     Otherwise,  if the <b>EP_BASE</b> directory property is set then components of an external project
                     are stored under the specified base:

                        TMP_DIR      = &lt;base&gt;<a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>&lt;name&gt;
                        STAMP_DIR    = &lt;base&gt;/Stamp/&lt;name&gt;
                        DOWNLOAD_DIR = &lt;base&gt;/Download/&lt;name&gt;
                        SOURCE_DIR   = &lt;base&gt;/Source/&lt;name&gt;
                        BINARY_DIR   = &lt;base&gt;/Build/&lt;name&gt;
                        INSTALL_DIR  = &lt;base&gt;/Install/&lt;name&gt;
                        LOG_DIR      = &lt;STAMP_DIR&gt;

                     If no <b>PREFIX</b>, <b>EP_PREFIX</b>, or <b>EP_BASE</b> is specified, then the default  is  to  set  <b>PREFIX</b>  to
                     <b>&lt;name&gt;-prefix</b>.  Relative  paths are interpreted with respect to <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</b> at
                     the point where <b>ExternalProject_Add()</b> is called.

              <b>Download</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Options:</b>
                     A download method can be omitted if the <b>SOURCE_DIR</b> option is used to point to  an  existing
                     non-empty  directory.  Otherwise,  one  of  the  download  methods  below must be specified
                     (multiple download methods should not be given) or a custom <b>DOWNLOAD_COMMAND</b> provided.

                     <b>DOWNLOAD_COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
                            Overrides the  command  used  for  the  download  step  (<b>generator</b>  <b>expressions</b>  are
                            supported). If this option is specified, all other download options will be ignored.
                            Providing an empty string for <b>&lt;cmd&gt;</b> effectively disables the download step.

                     <u>URL</u> <u>Download</u>

                            <b>URL</b> <b>&lt;url1&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;url2&gt;...]</b>
                                   List  of paths and/or URL(s) of the external project’s source. When more than
                                   one URL is given, they are tried in turn until one succeeds. A URL may be  an
                                   ordinary path in the local file system (in which case it must be the only URL
                                   provided)  or any downloadable URL supported by the <b>file(DOWNLOAD)</b> command. A
                                   local filesystem path may refer to either an  existing  directory  or  to  an
                                   archive  file,  whereas  a  URL  is  expected to point to a file which can be
                                   treated as an  archive.  When  an  archive  is  used,  it  will  be  unpacked
                                   automatically unless the <b>DOWNLOAD_NO_EXTRACT</b> option is set to prevent it. The
                                   archive type is determined by inspecting the actual content rather than using
                                   logic based on the file extension.

                            <b>URL_HASH</b> <b>&lt;algo&gt;=&lt;hashValue&gt;</b>
                                   Hash of the archive file to be downloaded. The argument should be of the form
                                   <b>&lt;algo&gt;=&lt;hashValue&gt;</b>  where <b>algo</b> can be any of the hashing algorithms supported
                                   by the <b>file()</b> command. Specifying this option is strongly recommended for URL
                                   downloads, as it ensures the integrity of the downloaded content. It is  also
                                   used  as a check for a previously downloaded file, allowing connection to the
                                   remote location to be avoided altogether if the local directory already has a
                                   file from an earlier download that matches the specified hash.

                            <b>URL_MD5</b> <b>&lt;md5&gt;</b>
                                   Equivalent to <b>URL_HASH</b> <b>MD5=&lt;md5&gt;</b>.

                            <b>DOWNLOAD_NAME</b> <b>&lt;fname&gt;</b>
                                   File name to use for the downloaded file. If not given, the end of the URL is
                                   used to determine the file name. This option is rarely  needed,  the  default
                                   name  is generally suitable and is not normally used outside of code internal
                                   to the <b>ExternalProject</b> module.

                            <b>DOWNLOAD_NO_EXTRACT</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                                   Allows the extraction part of the download step to be disabled by  passing  a
                                   boolean  true  value  for  this  option.  If  this  option  is not given, the
                                   downloaded contents will be unpacked automatically if required. If extraction
                                   has been disabled, the full path to  the  downloaded  file  is  available  as
                                   <b>&lt;DOWNLOADED_FILE&gt;</b> in subsequent steps or as the property <b>DOWNLOADED_FILE</b> with
                                   the <u>ExternalProject_Get_Property()</u> command.

                            <b>DOWNLOAD_NO_PROGRESS</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                                   Can  be  used to disable logging the download progress. If this option is not
                                   given, download progress messages will be logged.

                            <b>TIMEOUT</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
                                   Maximum time allowed for file download operations.

                            <b>HTTP_USERNAME</b> <b>&lt;username&gt;</b>
                                   Username for the download operation if authentication is required.

                            <b>HTTP_PASSWORD</b> <b>&lt;password&gt;</b>
                                   Password for the download operation if authentication is required.

                            <b>HTTP_HEADER</b> <b>&lt;header1&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;header2&gt;...]</b>
                                   Provides an arbitrary list of HTTP headers for the download operation.   This
                                   can be useful for accessing content in systems like AWS, etc.

                            <b>TLS_VERIFY</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                                   Specifies  whether  certificate  verification  should  be performed for https
                                   URLs. If this option is not provided, the default behavior is  determined  by
                                   the  <b>CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY</b> variable (see <b>file(DOWNLOAD)</b>). If that is also not set,
                                   certificate verification will not be performed. In situations where  <b>URL_HASH</b>
                                   cannot be provided, this option can be an alternative verification measure.

                            <b>TLS_CAINFO</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
                                   Specify  a custom certificate authority file to use if <b>TLS_VERIFY</b> is enabled.
                                   If this option is not specified, the value of the  <b>CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO</b>  variable
                                   will be used instead (see <b>file(DOWNLOAD)</b>)

                            <b>NETRC</b> <b>&lt;level&gt;</b>
                                   Specify  whether  the .netrc file is to be used for operation. If this option
                                   is not specified, the value of the <b>CMAKE_NETRC</b> variable will be used  instead
                                   (see <b>file(DOWNLOAD)</b>) Valid levels are:

                                   <b>IGNORED</b>
                                          The .netrc file is ignored.  This is the default.

                                   <b>OPTIONAL</b>
                                          The  .netrc file is optional, and information in the URL is preferred.
                                          The file will be  scanned  to  find  which  ever  information  is  not
                                          specified in the URL.

                                   <b>REQUIRED</b>
                                          The .netrc file is required, and information in the URL is ignored.

                            <b>NETRC_FILE</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
                                   Specify  an  alternative .netrc file to the one in your home directory if the
                                   <b>NETRC</b> level is <b>OPTIONAL</b> or <b>REQUIRED</b>. If this option  is  not  specified,  the
                                   value   of   the   <b>CMAKE_NETRC_FILE</b>   variable  will  be  used  instead  (see
                                   <b>file(DOWNLOAD)</b>)

                     <u>Git</u>    NOTE: A git version of 1.6.5 or later is required if this download method is used.

                            <b>GIT_REPOSITORY</b> <b>&lt;url&gt;</b>
                                   URL of the git repository. Any URL understood by the <b>git</b> command may be used.

                            <b>GIT_TAG</b> <b>&lt;tag&gt;</b>
                                   Git branch name, tag or commit hash. Note that branch names and  tags  should
                                   generally  be  specified  as  remote  names (i.e. <b>origin/myBranch</b> rather than
                                   simply <b>myBranch</b>). This ensures that if the remote end has its  tag  moved  or
                                   branch  rebased  or  history rewritten, the local clone will still be updated
                                   correctly. In general, however, specifying a commit hash should be  preferred
                                   for a number of reasons:

                                   • If the local clone already has the commit corresponding to the hash, no <b>git</b>
                                     <b>fetch</b> needs to be performed to check for changes each time CMake is re-run.
                                     This  can  result  in  a significant speed up if many external projects are
                                     being used.

                                   • Using a specific git hash ensures that the main project’s  own  history  is
                                     fully traceable to a specific point in the external project’s evolution. If
                                     a  branch  or tag name is used instead, then checking out a specific commit
                                     of the main project doesn’t necessarily pin the whole build to  a  specific
                                     point  in the life of the external project.  The lack of such deterministic
                                     behavior makes the main project lose traceability and repeatability.

                                   If <b>GIT_SHALLOW</b> is enabled then <b>GIT_TAG</b> works only with branch names and tags.
                                   A commit hash is not allowed.

                            <b>GIT_REMOTE_NAME</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
                                   The optional name of the remote. If this option is not specified, it defaults
                                   to <b>origin</b>.

                            <b>GIT_SUBMODULES</b> <b>&lt;module&gt;...</b>
                                   Specific git submodules that should also be updated. If this  option  is  not
                                   provided, all git submodules will be updated.

                            <b>GIT_SHALLOW</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                                   When  this  option  is  enabled,  the  <b>git</b>  <b>clone</b> operation will be given the
                                   <b>--depth</b> <b>1</b> option. This performs a shallow clone, which avoids downloading the
                                   whole history and instead retrieves just the commit denoted  by  the  <b>GIT_TAG</b>
                                   option.

                            <b>GIT_PROGRESS</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                                   When  enabled,  this  option  instructs the <b>git</b> <b>clone</b> operation to report its
                                   progress by passing it the <b>--progress</b> option. Without this option, the  clone
                                   step  for  large  projects  may appear to make the build stall, since nothing
                                   will be logged until the clone operation finishes. While this option  can  be
                                   used  to  provide  progress  to  prevent  the  appearance of the build having
                                   stalled, it may also make the build overly noisy if lots of external projects
                                   are used.

                            <b>GIT_CONFIG</b> <b>&lt;option1&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;option2&gt;...]</b>
                                   Specify a list of config options to pass to <b>git</b>  <b>clone</b>.  Each  option  listed
                                   will  be  transformed into its own <b>--config</b> <b>&lt;option&gt;</b> on the <b>git</b> <b>clone</b> command
                                   line, with each option required to be in the form <b>key=value</b>.

                                   Tag to checkout from the CVS repository.

              <b>Update/Patch</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Options:</b>
                     Whenever CMake is re-run, by default the external project’s sources will be updated if  the
                     download  method  supports  updates  (e.g. a git repository would be checked if the <b>GIT_TAG</b>
                     does not refer to a specific commit).

                     <b>UPDATE_COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
                            Overrides the download method’s update step with a custom command.  The command  may
                            use <b>generator</b> <b>expressions</b>.

                     <b>UPDATE_DISCONNECTED</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            When  enabled,  this  option  causes  the  update  step  to be skipped. It does not,
                            however, prevent the download step. The update step can still be  added  as  a  step
                            target  (see  <u>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</u>) and called manually. This is useful
                            if you want to allow developers to build the  project  when  disconnected  from  the
                            network (the network may still be needed for the download step though).

                            When  this  option  is  present, it is generally advisable to make the value a cache
                            variable under the developer’s control rather than hard-coding it. If this option is
                            not present, the default value is taken from  the  <b>EP_UPDATE_DISCONNECTED</b>  directory
                            property.  If  that  is  also  not  defined,  updates  are  performed as normal. The
                            <b>EP_UPDATE_DISCONNECTED</b>  directory  property  is  intended  as  a   convenience   for
                            controlling  the  <b>UPDATE_DISCONNECTED</b>  behavior for an entire section of a project’s
                            directory hierarchy and may be a more convenient method of giving developers control
                            over whether or not to perform updates (assuming the project also provides  a  cache
                            variable or some other convenient method for setting the directory property).

                     <b>PATCH_COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
                            Specifies  a  custom  command  to  patch the sources after an update. By default, no
                            patch command is defined.  Note  that  it  can  be  quite  difficult  to  define  an
                            appropriate  patch  command  that performs robustly, especially for download methods
                            such as git where changing the <b>GIT_TAG</b> will not  discard  changes  from  a  previous
                            patch, but the patch command will be called again after updating to the new tag.

              <b>Configure</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Options:</b>
                     The  configure  step  is  run after the download and update steps. By default, the external
                     project is assumed to be a CMake project, but this can be overridden if required.

                     <b>CONFIGURE_COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
                            The default configure command runs CMake with options based on the main project. For
                            non-CMake external projects, the <b>CONFIGURE_COMMAND</b> option must be used  to  override
                            this  behavior  (<b>generator</b>  <b>expressions</b> are supported). For projects that require no
                            configure step, specify this option with an empty string as the command to execute.

                     <b>CMAKE_COMMAND</b> <b>/.../cmake</b>
                            Specify an alternative cmake executable for the  configure  step  (use  an  absolute
                            path).  This  is generally not recommended, since it is usually desirable to use the
                            same CMake version throughout the whole build. This option is ignored  if  a  custom
                            configure command has been specified with <b>CONFIGURE_COMMAND</b>.

                     <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR</b> <b>&lt;gen&gt;</b>
                            Override  the  CMake generator used for the configure step. Without this option, the
                            same generator as the main build will be used. This option is ignored  if  a  custom
                            configure command has been specified with the <b>CONFIGURE_COMMAND</b> option.

                     <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM</b> <b>&lt;platform&gt;</b>
                            Pass    a   generator-specific   platform   name   to   the   CMake   command   (see
                            <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM</b>). It is  an  error  to  provide  this  option  without  the
                            <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR</b> option.

                     <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</b> <b>&lt;toolset&gt;</b>
                            Pass    a    generator-specific   toolset   name   to   the   CMake   command   (see
                            <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</b>). It  is  an  error  to  provide  this  option  without  the
                            <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR</b> option.

                     <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE</b> <b>&lt;instance&gt;</b>
                            Pass   a   generator-specific   instance   selection   to  the  CMake  command  (see
                            <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE</b>). It is  an  error  to  provide  this  option  without  the
                            <b>CMAKE_GENERATOR</b> option.

                     <b>CMAKE_ARGS</b> <b>&lt;arg&gt;...</b>
                            The  specified  arguments  are  passed  to  the  <b>cmake</b> command line. They can be any
                            argument the <b>cmake</b> command understands, not  just  cache  values  defined  by  <b>-D...</b>
                            arguments  (see  also  <b>CMake</b>  <b>Options</b>).  In  addition,  arguments  may use <b>generator</b>
                            <b>expressions</b>.

                     <b>CMAKE_CACHE_ARGS</b> <b>&lt;arg&gt;...</b>
                            This is an alternate way of specifying cache variables  where  command  line  length
                            issues  may  become  a  problem.  The  arguments  are  expected  to  be  in the form
                            <b>-Dvar:STRING=value</b>, which are then transformed into CMake <b>set()</b>  commands  with  the
                            <b>FORCE</b>  option  used.  These <b>set()</b> commands are written to a pre-load script which is
                            then applied using the <b>cmake</b> <b>-C</b> command line option.  Arguments  may  use  <b>generator</b>
                            <b>expressions</b>.

                     <b>CMAKE_CACHE_DEFAULT_ARGS</b> <b>&lt;arg&gt;...</b>
                            This  is  the  same  as the <b>CMAKE_CACHE_ARGS</b> option except the <b>set()</b> commands do not
                            include the <b>FORCE</b> keyword. This means the values act as initial  defaults  only  and
                            will  not  override  any  variables already set from a previous run. Use this option
                            with care, as it can lead to different  behavior  depending  on  whether  the  build
                            starts from a fresh build directory or re-uses previous build contents.

                     <b>SOURCE_SUBDIR</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                            When  no  <b>CONFIGURE_COMMAND</b>  option  is  specified,  the  configure step assumes the
                            external project has a <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file at the top of its source  tree  (i.e.  in
                            <b>SOURCE_DIR</b>).  The  <b>SOURCE_SUBDIR</b>  option  can  be  used  to  point to an alternative
                            directory within the source tree to use as the top of the CMake source tree instead.
                            This must be a relative path and  it  will  be  interpreted  as  being  relative  to
                            <b>SOURCE_DIR</b>.  When <b>BUILD_IN_SOURCE</b> <b>1</b> is specified, the <b>BUILD_COMMAND</b> is used to point
                            to an alternative directory within the source tree.

              <b>Build</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Options:</b>
                     If  the  configure  step  assumed  the external project uses CMake as its build system, the
                     build step will also. Otherwise, the build step will  assume  a  Makefile-based  build  and
                     simply  run  <b>make</b>  with no arguments as the default build step. This can be overridden with
                     custom build commands if required.

                     <b>BUILD_COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
                            Overrides the default build command (<b>generator</b> <b>expressions</b> are supported).  If  this
                            option  is not given, the default build command will be chosen to integrate with the
                            main build in the most appropriate way  (e.g.  using  recursive  <b>make</b>  for  Makefile
                            generators  or  <b>cmake</b> <b>--build</b> if the project uses a CMake build). This option can be
                            specified with an empty string as the command to make the build step do nothing.

                     <b>BUILD_IN_SOURCE</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            When this option is enabled, the build will be done  directly  within  the  external
                            project’s source tree. This should generally be avoided, the use of a separate build
                            directory  is  usually  preferred,  but  it  can be useful when the external project
                            assumes an in-source build.  The  <b>BINARY_DIR</b>  option  should  not  be  specified  if
                            building in-source.

                     <b>BUILD_ALWAYS</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            Enabling this option forces the build step to always be run. This can be the easiest
                            way  to  robustly  ensure  that  the  external  project’s own build dependencies are
                            evaluated rather than relying on the default success  timestamp-based  method.  This
                            option is not normally needed unless developers are expected to modify something the
                            external  project’s  build  depends  on in a way that is not detectable via the step
                            target  dependencies  (e.g.  <b>SOURCE_DIR</b>  is  used  without  a  download  method  and
                            developers might modify the sources in <b>SOURCE_DIR</b>).

                     <b>BUILD_BYPRODUCTS</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b>
                            Specifies files that will be generated by the build command but which might or might
                            not  have their modification time updated by subsequent builds. These ultimately get
                            passed  through  as  <b>BYPRODUCTS</b>  to  the  build  step’s  own  underlying   call   to
                            <b>add_custom_command()</b>.

              <b>Install</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Options:</b>
                     If  the  configure  step  assumed  the external project uses CMake as its build system, the
                     install step will also. Otherwise, the install step will assume a Makefile-based build  and
                     simply  run  <b>make</b>  <b>install</b>  as  the  default build step. This can be overridden with custom
                     install commands if required.

                     <b>INSTALL_COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
                            The external project’s own install step is invoked as part  of  the  main  project’s
                            <u>build</u>. It is done after the external project’s build step and may be before or after
                            the  external  project’s  test  step (see the <b>TEST_BEFORE_INSTALL</b> option below). The
                            external project’s install rules are not part of the main project’s  install  rules,
                            so  if  anything  from  the external project should be installed as part of the main
                            build, these need to  be  specified  in  the  main  build  as  additional  <b>install()</b>
                            commands.  The  default  install  step  builds  the  <b>install</b>  target of the external
                            project, but this can  be  overridden  with  a  custom  command  using  this  option
                            (<b>generator</b>  <b>expressions</b>  are  supported). Passing an empty string as the <b>&lt;cmd&gt;</b> makes
                            the install step do nothing.

              <b>Test</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Options:</b>
                     The test step is only defined if at least  one  of  the  following  <b>TEST_...</b>   options  are
                     provided.

                     <b>TEST_COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
                            Overrides  the  default  test command (<b>generator</b> <b>expressions</b> are supported). If this
                            option is not given, the default behavior of the test step is to build the  external
                            project’s  own  <b>test</b>  target.  This  option  can be specified with <b>&lt;cmd&gt;</b> as an empty
                            string, which allows the test step to still be defined, but it will do  nothing.  Do
                            not  specify  any  of the other <b>TEST_...</b> options if providing an empty string as the
                            test command, but prefer to omit all <b>TEST_...</b> options altogether if  the  test  step
                            target is not needed.

                     <b>TEST_BEFORE_INSTALL</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            When this option is enabled, the test step will be executed before the install step.
                            The default behavior is for the test step to run after the install step.

                     <b>TEST_AFTER_INSTALL</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            This  option is mainly useful as a way to indicate that the test step is desired but
                            all default behavior is sufficient. Specifying this option with a boolean true value
                            ensures the test step is defined and that it comes after the install step.  If  both
                            <b>TEST_BEFORE_INSTALL</b>  and  <b>TEST_AFTER_INSTALL</b>  are  enabled,  the  latter is silently
                            ignored.

                     <b>TEST_EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            If enabled, the main build’s default ALL target will not depend on  the  test  step.
                            This  can be a useful way of ensuring the test step is defined but only gets invoked
                            when manually requested.

              <b>Output</b> <b>Logging</b> <b>Options:</b>
                     Each of the following <b>LOG_...</b> options can be used to wrap the relevant step in a script  to
                     capture  its  output  to  files.  The  log  files will be created in <b>LOG_DIR</b> if supplied or
                     otherwise the <b>STAMP_DIR</b> directory with step-specific file names.

                     <b>LOG_DOWNLOAD</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            When enabled, the output of the download step is logged to files.

                     <b>LOG_UPDATE</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            When enabled, the output of the update step is logged to files.

                     <b>LOG_PATCH</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            When enabled, the output of the patch step is logged to files.

                     <b>LOG_CONFIGURE</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            When enabled, the output of the configure step is logged to files.

                     <b>LOG_BUILD</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            When enabled, the output of the build step is logged to files.

                     <b>LOG_INSTALL</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            When enabled, the output of the install step is logged to files.

                     <b>LOG_TEST</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            When enabled, the output of the test step is logged to files.

                     <b>LOG_MERGED_STDOUTERR</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            When enabled, stdout and stderr will be merged for any step whose  output  is  being
                            logged to files.

                     <b>LOG_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            This  option  only  has an effect if at least one of the other <b>LOG_&lt;step&gt;</b> options is
                            enabled.  If an error occurs for a step which has  logging  to  file  enabled,  that
                            step’s  output  will  be  printed  to the console if <b>LOG_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE</b> is set to
                            true.  For cases where a large amount of output is recorded, just the  end  of  that
                            output may be printed to the console.

              <b>Terminal</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Options:</b>
                     Steps can be given direct access to the terminal in some cases. Giving a step access to the
                     terminal  may  allow  it  to receive terminal input if required, such as for authentication
                     details not provided by other options.  With the <b>Ninja</b> generator, these options  place  the
                     steps  in  the <b>console</b> <b>job</b> <b>pool</b>. Each step can be given access to the terminal individually
                     via the following options:

                     <b>USES_TERMINAL_DOWNLOAD</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            Give the download step access to the terminal.

                     <b>USES_TERMINAL_UPDATE</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            Give the update step access to the terminal.

                     <b>USES_TERMINAL_CONFIGURE</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            Give the configure step access to the terminal.

                     <b>USES_TERMINAL_BUILD</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            Give the build step access to the terminal.

                     <b>USES_TERMINAL_INSTALL</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            Give the install step access to the terminal.

                     <b>USES_TERMINAL_TEST</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            Give the test step access to the terminal.

              <b>Target</b> <b>Options:</b>

                     <b>DEPENDS</b> <b>&lt;targets&gt;...</b>
                            Specify other targets on which the external project depends. The other targets  will
                            be  brought  up  to  date  before  any of the external project’s steps are executed.
                            Because the external project uses additional  custom  targets  internally  for  each
                            step,  the  <b>DEPENDS</b>  option  is the most convenient way to ensure all of those steps
                            depend on the other targets.  Simply doing <b>add_dependencies(&lt;name&gt;</b>  <b>&lt;targets&gt;)</b>  will
                            not make any of the steps dependent on <b>&lt;targets&gt;</b>.

                     <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                            When  enabled, this option excludes the external project from the default ALL target
                            of the main build.

                     <b>STEP_TARGETS</b> <b>&lt;step-target&gt;...</b>
                            Generate custom targets for the specified steps. This is required if the steps  need
                            to  be  triggered  manually  or  if  they  need  to be used as dependencies of other
                            targets. If this option is not specified,  the  default  value  is  taken  from  the
                            <b>EP_STEP_TARGETS</b>   directory  property.   See  <u>ExternalProject_Add_Step()</u>  below  for
                            further discussion of the effects of this option.

                     <b>INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS</b> <b>&lt;step-target&gt;...</b>
                            Generate custom targets for the specified  steps  and  prevent  these  targets  from
                            having  the usual dependencies applied to them. If this option is not specified, the
                            default value is taken from the <b>EP_INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS</b> directory property. This
                            option is mostly useful for allowing individual steps to  be  driven  independently,
                            such  as  for  a  CDash  setup  where  each  step  should  be initiated and reported
                            individually rather than as one whole build.  See  <u>ExternalProject_Add_Step()</u>  below
                            for further discussion of the effects of this option.

              <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Options:</b>

                     <b>LIST_SEPARATOR</b> <b>&lt;sep&gt;</b>
                            For  any  of  the various <b>..._COMMAND</b> options, replace <b>;</b> with <b>&lt;sep&gt;</b> in the specified
                            command lines. This can be useful where list variables  may  be  given  in  commands
                            where they should end up as space-separated arguments (<b>&lt;sep&gt;</b> would be a single space
                            character string in this case).

                     <b>COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
                            Any  of  the other <b>..._COMMAND</b> options can have additional commands appended to them
                            by following them with as many <b>COMMAND</b> <b>...</b> options as needed (<b>generator</b>  <b>expressions</b>
                            are supported). For example:

                               ExternalProject_Add(example
                                 ... # Download options, etc.
                                 BUILD_COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "Starting $&lt;CONFIG&gt; build"
                                 COMMAND       ${CMAKE_COMMAND} --build &lt;BINARY_DIR&gt; --config $&lt;CONFIG&gt;
                                 COMMAND       ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "$&lt;CONFIG&gt; build complete"
                               )

              It  should also be noted that each build step is created via a call to <u>ExternalProject_Add_Step()</u>.
              See that command’s documentation for the automatic  substitutions  that  are  supported  for  some
              options.

   <b>Obtaining</b> <b>Project</b> <b>Properties</b>
       <b>ExternalProject_Get_Property</b>
              The <b>ExternalProject_Get_Property()</b> function retrieves external project target properties:

                 ExternalProject_Get_Property(&lt;name&gt; &lt;prop1&gt; [&lt;prop2&gt;...])

              The  function  stores  property values in variables of the same name. Property names correspond to
              the keyword argument names of <b>ExternalProject_Add()</b>.  For example, the source directory  might  be
              retrieved like so:

                 ExternalProject_Get_property(myExtProj SOURCE_DIR)
                 message("Source dir of myExtProj = ${SOURCE_DIR}")

   <b>Explicit</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Management</b>
       The  <b>ExternalProject_Add()</b>  function on its own is often sufficient for incorporating an external project
       into the main build. Certain scenarios require additional work to implement  desired  behavior,  such  as
       adding   in   a   custom   step   or   making  steps  available  as  manually  triggerable  targets.  The
       <b>ExternalProject_Add_Step()</b>,  <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</b>  and  <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies</b>
       functions provide the lower level control needed to implement such step-level capabilities.

       <b>ExternalProject_Add_Step</b>
              The  <b>ExternalProject_Add_Step()</b>  function  specifies  an  additional  custom  step for an external
              project defined by an earlier call to <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>:

                 ExternalProject_Add_Step(&lt;name&gt; &lt;step&gt; [&lt;option&gt;...])

              <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> is the same as the name passed to the original call to <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>. The specified
              <b>&lt;step&gt;</b> must not be one of the pre-defined steps  (<b>mkdir</b>,  <b>download</b>,  <b>update</b>,  <b>skip-update</b>,  <b>patch</b>,
              <b>configure</b>, <b>build</b>, <b>install</b> or <b>test</b>). The supported options are:

              <b>COMMAND</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;...</b>
                     The  command line to be executed by this custom step (<b>generator</b> <b>expressions</b> are supported).
                     This option can be repeated multiple times to specify multiple commands to be  executed  in
                     order.

              <b>COMMENT</b> <b>"&lt;text&gt;..."</b>
                     Text to be printed when the custom step executes.

              <b>DEPENDEES</b> <b>&lt;step&gt;...</b>
                     Other steps (custom or pre-defined) on which this step depends.

              <b>DEPENDERS</b> <b>&lt;step&gt;...</b>
                     Other steps (custom or pre-defined) that depend on this new custom step.

              <b>DEPENDS</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b>
                     Files on which this custom step depends.

              <b>BYPRODUCTS</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b>
                     Files  that  will  be generated by this custom step but which might or might not have their
                     modification time updated by subsequent builds. This  list  of  files  will  ultimately  be
                     passed  through  as the <b>BYPRODUCTS</b> option to the <b>add_custom_command()</b> used to implement the
                     custom step internally.

              <b>ALWAYS</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                     When enabled, this option specifies that the custom step should always be run (i.e. that it
                     is always considered out of date).

              <b>EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                     When enabled, this option specifies that the external project’s main target does not depend
                     on the custom step.

              <b>WORKING_DIRECTORY</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
                     Specifies the working directory to set before running the custom step’s  command.  If  this
                     option is not specified, the directory will be the value of the <b>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR</b> at
                     the point where <b>ExternalProject_Add_Step()</b> was called.

              <b>LOG</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                     If set, this causes the output from the custom step to be captured to files in the external
                     project’s <b>LOG_DIR</b> if supplied or <b>STAMP_DIR</b>.

              <b>USES_TERMINAL</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
                     If enabled, this gives the custom step direct access to the terminal if possible.

              The  command line, comment, working directory and byproducts of every standard and custom step are
              processed  to  replace  the  tokens  <b>&lt;SOURCE_DIR&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;SOURCE_SUBDIR&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;BINARY_DIR&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;</b>
              <b>&lt;TMP_DIR&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;DOWNLOAD_DIR&gt;</b>  and <b>&lt;DOWNLOADED_FILE&gt;</b> with their corresponding property values defined
              in the original call to <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>.

       <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets</b>
              The <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</b> function generates targets for the steps listed. The name of
              each created target will be of the form <b>&lt;name&gt;-&lt;step&gt;</b>:

                 ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(&lt;name&gt; [NO_DEPENDS] &lt;step1&gt; [&lt;step2&gt;...])

              Creating a target for a step allows it to be used as a dependency  of  another  target  or  to  be
              triggered  manually. Having targets for specific steps also allows them to be driven independently
              of each other by specifying targets on build command lines. For example, you may be submitting  to
              a  sub-project  based  dashboard  where you want to drive the configure portion of the build, then
              submit to the dashboard, followed by the build portion, followed by tests. If you invoke a  custom
              target  that  depends  on  a step halfway through the step dependency chain, then all the previous
              steps will also run to ensure everything is up to date.

              If the <b>NO_DEPENDS</b> option is specified, the step target will not depend on the dependencies of  the
              external   project   (i.e.   on   any   dependencies  of  the  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>  custom  target  created  by
              <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>). This is usually safe for the <b>download</b>, <b>update</b> and <b>patch</b> steps, since  they
              do  not typically require that the dependencies are updated and built. Using <b>NO_DEPENDS</b> for any of
              the other pre-defined steps, however, may break parallel builds. Only use <b>NO_DEPENDS</b> where  it  is
              certain  that  the  named  steps  genuinely  do  not have dependencies. For custom steps, consider
              whether or not the custom commands require the dependencies to be configured, built and installed.

              Internally, <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u> calls <u>ExternalProject_Add_Step()</u> to create  each  step.  If  any
              <b>STEP_TARGETS</b>  or  <b>INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS</b>  were specified, then <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</b>
              will also be called after <u>ExternalProject_Add_Step()</u>. <b>INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS</b> have the <b>NO_DEPENDS</b>
              option  set,  whereas  <b>STEP_TARGETS</b>  do  not.  Other  than  that,  the  two  options   result   in
              <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</b> being called in the same way. Even if a step is not mentioned in
              either  of  those  two  options,  <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</b>  can  still be called later to
              manually define a target for the step.

              The <b>STEP_TARGETS</b> and <b>INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS</b> options for <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u> are generally  the
              easiest  way  to  ensure  targets  are  created  for specific steps of interest. For custom steps,
              <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</b> must be called explicitly if a target should also be created for
              that custom step. An alternative to these two options  is  to  populate  the  <b>EP_STEP_TARGETS</b>  and
              <b>EP_INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS</b>  directory  properties.  These  act  as  defaults  for the step target
              options and can save having to repeatedly specify the same  set  of  step  targets  when  multiple
              external projects are being defined.

       <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies</b>
              The <b>ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies()</b> function can be used to add dependencies to a step. The
              dependencies  added must be targets CMake already knows about (these can be ordinary executable or
              library targets, custom targets or even step targets of another external project):

                 ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies(&lt;name&gt; &lt;step&gt; &lt;target1&gt; [&lt;target2&gt;...])

              This function takes care to set both target and file  level  dependencies  and  will  ensure  that
              parallel  builds will not break. It should be used instead of <b>add_dependencies()</b> whenever adding a
              dependency for some of the step targets generated by the <b>ExternalProject</b> module.

   <b>Examples</b>
       The following example shows how to download and build a hypothetical project called <u>FooBar</u> from github:

          include(ExternalProject)
          ExternalProject_Add(foobar
            GIT_REPOSITORY    <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:FooCo/FooBar.git
            GIT_TAG           origin/release/1.2.3
          )

       For the sake of the example, also define a second hypothetical external project called <u>SecretSauce</u>, which
       is downloaded from a web server. Two URLs are given to take advantage of a  faster  internal  network  if
       available, with a fallback to a slower external server. The project is a typical <b>Makefile</b> project with no
       configure  step,  so some of the default commands are overridden. The build is only required to build the
       <u>sauce</u> target:

          find_program(MAKE_EXE NAMES gmake nmake make)
          ExternalProject_Add(secretsauce
            URL               <a href="http://intranet.somecompany.com/artifacts/sauce-2.7.tgz">http://intranet.somecompany.com/artifacts/sauce-2.7.tgz</a>
                              https://www.somecompany.com/downloads/sauce-2.7.zip
            URL_HASH          MD5=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
            CONFIGURE_COMMAND ""
            BUILD_COMMAND     ${MAKE_EXE} sauce
          )

       Suppose the build step of <b>secretsauce</b> requires that <b>foobar</b> must already be built. This could be  enforced
       like so:

          ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies(secretsauce build foobar)

       Another  alternative  would  be  to  create  a custom target for <b>foobar</b>’s build step and make <b>secretsauce</b>
       depend on that rather than the whole <b>foobar</b> project. This would mean <b>foobar</b> only needs to  be  built,  it
       doesn’t need to run its install or test steps before <b>secretsauce</b> can be built. The dependency can also be
       defined along with the <b>secretsauce</b> project:

          ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(foobar build)
          ExternalProject_Add(secretsauce
            URL               <a href="http://intranet.somecompany.com/artifacts/sauce-2.7.tgz">http://intranet.somecompany.com/artifacts/sauce-2.7.tgz</a>
                              https://www.somecompany.com/downloads/sauce-2.7.zip
            URL_HASH          MD5=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
            CONFIGURE_COMMAND ""
            BUILD_COMMAND     ${MAKE_EXE} sauce
            DEPENDS           foobar-build
          )

       Instead  of  calling <u>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()</u>, the target could be defined along with the <b>foobar</b>
       project itself:

          ExternalProject_Add(foobar
            GIT_REPOSITORY <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:FooCo/FooBar.git
            GIT_TAG        origin/release/1.2.3
            STEP_TARGETS   build
          )

       If many external projects should have the same set of step targets, setting a directory property  may  be
       more  convenient.  The  <b>build</b>  step  target could be created automatically by setting the <b>EP_STEP_TARGETS</b>
       directory property before creating the external projects with <u>ExternalProject_Add()</u>:

          set_property(DIRECTORY PROPERTY EP_STEP_TARGETS build)

       Lastly, suppose that <b>secretsauce</b> provides a script called <b>makedoc</b> which can be used to generate  its  own
       documentation.  Further  suppose  that the script expects the output directory to be provided as the only
       parameter and that it should be run from the <b>secretsauce</b> source directory. A custom  step  and  a  custom
       target to trigger the script can be defined like so:

          ExternalProject_Add_Step(secretsauce docs
            COMMAND           &lt;SOURCE_DIR&gt;/makedoc &lt;BINARY_DIR&gt;
            WORKING_DIRECTORY &lt;SOURCE_DIR&gt;
            COMMENT           "Building secretsauce docs"
            ALWAYS            TRUE
            EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN TRUE
          )
          ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(secretsauce docs)

       The custom step could then be triggered from the main build like so:

          cmake --build . --target secretsauce-docs

   <b>CMakeParseArguments</b>
       Parse arguments given to a macro or a function.

       cmake_parse_arguments()  is intended to be used in macros or functions for parsing the arguments given to
       that macro or function.  It processes the arguments and defines a set of variables which hold the  values
       of the respective options.

          cmake_parse_arguments(&lt;prefix&gt;
                                &lt;options&gt;
                                &lt;one_value_keywords&gt;
                                &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt;
                                [CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS_SKIP_EMPTY|CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS_KEEP_EMPTY]
                                args...
                                )

       The  &lt;options&gt;  argument  contains all options for the respective macro, i.e.  keywords which can be used
       when calling the macro without any value following, like e.g.  the  OPTIONAL  keyword  of  the  install()
       command.

       The  &lt;one_value_keywords&gt;  argument contains all keywords for this macro which are followed by one value,
       like e.g.  DESTINATION keyword of the install() command.

       The &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt; argument contains all keywords for this macro which can be  followed  by  more
       than one value, like e.g.  the TARGETS or FILES keywords of the install() command.

       When  done,  cmake_parse_arguments()  will  have  defined  for  each of the keywords listed in &lt;options&gt;,
       &lt;one_value_keywords&gt; and &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt; a variable composed of the given &lt;prefix&gt; followed by “_”
       and the name of the respective keyword.  These variables will then hold the  respective  value  from  the
       argument list.  For the &lt;options&gt; keywords this will be TRUE or FALSE.

       All  remaining  arguments  are  collected  in a variable &lt;prefix&gt;_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS, this can be checked
       afterwards to see whether your macro was called with unrecognized parameters.

       The cmake CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS_SKIP_EMPTY (old behaviour) and  CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS_KEEP_EMPTY  options
       decide  how  empty  arguments  should  be  handled.  If  none  of  these  options  is  set, for backwards
       compatibility, if CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION  &lt;  3.0.0,  the  default  behaviour  is  to  skip  empty
       arguments,     otherwise     the     default     behaviour     is     to    keep    them.    Using    the
       CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS_DEFAULT_SKIP_EMPTY variable the user can explicitly set the  default  behaviour  in
       current scope.

       As an example here a my_install() macro, which takes similar arguments as the real install() command:

          function(MY_INSTALL)
            set(options OPTIONAL FAST)
            set(oneValueArgs DESTINATION RENAME)
            set(multiValueArgs TARGETS CONFIGURATIONS)
            cmake_parse_arguments(MY_INSTALL "${options}" "${oneValueArgs}" "${multiValueArgs}" "${ARGN}" )
            ...

       Assume my_install() has been called like this:

          my_install(TARGETS foo bar DESTINATION bin OPTIONAL blub)

       After the cmake_parse_arguments() call the macro will have set the following variables:

          MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL = TRUE
          MY_INSTALL_FAST = FALSE (this option was not used when calling my_install()
          MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION = "bin"
          MY_INSTALL_RENAME = "" (was not used)
          MY_INSTALL_TARGETS = "foo;bar"
          MY_INSTALL_CONFIGURATIONS = "" (was not used)
          MY_INSTALL_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS = "blub" (no value expected after "OPTIONAL"

       You can then continue and process these variables.

       Keywords  terminate  lists  of  values,  e.g.   if  directly after a one_value_keyword another recognized
       keyword follows, this is interpreted as the beginning of the new option.   E.g.   my_install(TARGETS  foo
       DESTINATION    OPTIONAL)    would    result    in   MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION   set   to   “OPTIONAL”,   but
       MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION would be empty and MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL would be set to TRUE therefore.

       If the “CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS_SKIP_EMPTY” option is set,  cmake_parse_argumentswill  not  consider  empty
       arguments.  Therefore

          my_install(DESTINATION "" TARGETS foo "" bar)

       Will set

          MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION = (unset)
          MY_INSTALL_MULTI = "foo;bar"

       Using the “CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS_SKIP_EMPTY” option instead, will set

          MY_INSTALL_SINGLE = ""
          MY_INSTALL_MULTI = "foo;;bar"

       It is also important to note that:

          cmake_parse_arguments(MY_INSTALL "${options}" "${oneValueArgs}" "${multiValueArgs}" "${ARGN}" )
          cmake_parse_arguments(MY_INSTALL "${options}" "${oneValueArgs}" "${multiValueArgs}" ${ARGN} )

       Will   behave   differently,   because   in   the   latter   case  empty  arguments  are  not  passed  to
       cmake_parse_arguments.
