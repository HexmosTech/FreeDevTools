</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       begin-handler -  (service-processing)

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       Define a request handler.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
           begin-handler &lt;request path&gt; [ private | public ]
               &lt;any code&gt;
           end-handler

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       begin-handler  starts  the implementation of a <b>request</b> handler for &lt;request path&gt; (see <b>request</b>), which is
       &lt;any code&gt; up to end-handler. &lt;request path&gt; is not quoted.

       A &lt;request path&gt; is a path  consisting  of  any  number  of  path  segments.  A  request  path  can  have
       alphanumeric characters, hyphens and forward slashes, and can start only with a forward slash.

       For  example,  a  &lt;request path&gt; can be "/wine-items" or "/items/wine" etc. In general, it represents the
       nature of a request, such as an action on an object, a resource path handled  by  it  etc.  There  is  no
       specific way to interpret a request path, and you can construct it in a way that works for you.

       The  source  ".golf"  file name that implements a given begin-handler matches its path and name, fully or
       partially  (see  <b>request</b>).  For  example,  &lt;request  path&gt;  of  "/items/wine"  might  be  implemented  in
       "items/wine.golf" file (meaning in file "wine.golf" in subdirectory "items").

       Note  that you can also use "%%" instead of either begin-handler or end-handler or both. A &lt;request path&gt;
       cannot be a C reserved word, such as for instance "main" or "typedef" etc.

       <b>SECURITY</b> <b>OF</b> <b>REQUEST</b> <b>CALLS</b>

       If "public" clause is used, then a handler can be called from an outside caller, be  it  a  web  browser,
       some web service, <b>service</b> call or <b>command-line</b> program.

       If  "private"  clause  is  used,  then  a handler cannot be called from an outside caller; it can only be
       called from another handler by using <b>call-handler</b> statement.

       If neither "public" nor "private" is  used,  then  the  default  is  "private".  This  default  mechanism
       automatically guards direct execution by outside callers of all handlers not marked "public"; it provides
       automatic safety guard.

       You can change this default behavior with "--public" option in <b>gg</b>, in which case the default is "public".
       This  is  useful  if  either  all  request handlers should be public, or if only a handful fixed ones are
       private.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following begin-handler is implemented in file "items/wines/red-wine.golf":

           begin-handler  /items/wines/red-wine public
               @This is a request handler to display a list of red wines!
           end-handler

       Another way to write this is:

           %%  /items/wines/red-wine public
               @This is a request handler to display a list of red wines!
           %%
