       exec-program -  (program-execution)

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       Execute a program.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
           exec-program &lt;program path&gt; \
               [ args &lt;program arg&gt; [ , ... ] ] \
               [ status &lt;exit status&gt; ] \
               [ ( input &lt;input string&gt; [ input-length &lt;string length&gt; ] ) \
                   | ( input-file &lt;input file&gt; ) ] \
               [ ( output &lt;output string&gt;  ) \
                   | ( output-file &lt;output file&gt; ) ] \
               [ ( error &lt;error string&gt; ) | ( error-file &lt;error file&gt; ) ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       exec-program  executes  a  program  specified in &lt;program path&gt;, which can be a program name without path
       that exists in the path specified by the PATH environment variable;  or  an  absolute  path;  or  a  path
       relative to the application home directory (see <b>directories</b>).

       A  program can have input arguments (specified as strings with "args" clause), and if there are more than
       one, they must be separated by a comma. There is no limit on the number of input arguments, other than of
       the underlying Operating System.

       You can specify a status variable &lt;exit status&gt; - this variable will have  program's  exit  status.  Note
       that  if the program was terminated by a signal, &lt;exit status&gt; will have a value of 128+signal_number, so
       for example if the program was terminated with signal 9 (i.e. KILL signal), &lt;exit  status&gt;  will  be  137
       (i.e.  128+9). Any other kind of abnormal program termination (i.e. program termination where program did
       not set the exit code) will return 126 as &lt;exit code&gt;.

       Specifying program input and output is optional. If program has output and you are not  capturing  it  in
       any way, the output is redirected to a temporary file that is deleted after exec-program completes.

       You can specify an &lt;input string&gt; to be passed to program's standard input (stdin) via "input" clause. If
       "input-length"  is  not  used, the length of this input is the string length of &lt;input string&gt;, otherwise
       &lt;string length&gt; bytes is passed to the program. Alternatively, you can specify a file &lt;input  file&gt;  (via
       "input-file" clause) to be opened and directed into program's standard input (stdin).

       You  can  redirect  the  program's output (which is "stdout") to a file &lt;output file&gt; using "output-file"
       clause. Alternatively, program's output can be captured in &lt;output string&gt; (via "output" clause).

       To get the program's error output (which is "stderr") to file  &lt;error  file&gt;,  use  "error-file"  clause.
       Alternatively, program's error output can be captured in &lt;error string&gt; (via "error" clause).

       If  &lt;input  file&gt; cannot be opened, GG_ERR_READ is reported in &lt;exit status&gt;, and if either &lt;output file&gt;
       or &lt;error file&gt; cannot be opened, the status is GG_ERR_WRITE.

       Note that in general a program is considered successfully executed if it  returns  GG_OKAY  (i.e.  zero).
       Most programs returning non-zero value mean failure.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To simply execute a program that is in the path, without any arguments, input or output:

           exec-program "myprogram"

       Run  "grep"  program  using  a  string as its standard input in order to remove a line that contains "bad
       line" in it, and outputting the result into "ovar" variable:

           exec-program "grep" args "-v", "bad line" "config" input "line 1\nline 2\nbad line\nline 3" output ovar
           print-out ovar

       Get the list of files in the application home directory into buffer "ovar" and then display it:

           exec-program "ls" output ovar

       Similar to the above example of listing files, but output results to a file (which is then read  and  the
       result displayed), and provide options "-a -l -s" to "ls" program:

           exec-program "ls" args "-a", "-l", "-s" output-file "lsout"
           read-file "lsout" to final_res
           print-out final_res

       Count  the  lines of file "config" (which is redirected to the standard output of "wc" program) and store
       the result in variable "ovar" (by means of redirecting the output  of  "wc"  program  to  it),  and  then
       display:

           exec-program "wc" args "-l" input-file "config" output ovar
           print-out ovar
