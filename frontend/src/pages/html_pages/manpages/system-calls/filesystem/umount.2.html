</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       umount, umount2 - unmount filesystem

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C library (<u>libc</u>, <u>-lc</u>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/mount.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>umount(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>target</u><b>);</b>
       <b>int</b> <b>umount2(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>target</u><b>,</b> <b>int</b> <u>flags</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>umount</b>() and <b>umount2</b>() remove the attachment of the (topmost) filesystem mounted on <u>target</u>.

       Appropriate privilege (Linux: the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability) is required to unmount filesystems.

       Linux  2.1.116  added  the  <b>umount2</b>()  system  call,  which, like <b>umount</b>(), unmounts a target, but allows
       additional <u>flags</u> controlling the behavior of the operation:

       <b>MNT_FORCE</b> (since Linux 2.1.116)
              Ask the filesystem to abort pending requests before attempting the unmount.  This  may  allow  the
              unmount  to  complete  without waiting for an inaccessible server, but could cause data loss.  If,
              after aborting requests, some processes still  have  active  references  to  the  filesystem,  the
              unmount  will  still  fail.   As  at  Linux  4.12,  <b>MNT_FORCE</b>  is  supported only on the following
              filesystems: 9p (since Linux 2.6.16), ceph (since Linux 2.6.34), cifs (since Linux  2.6.12),  fuse
              (since Linux 2.6.16), lustre (since Linux 3.11), and NFS (since Linux 2.1.116).

       <b>MNT_DETACH</b> (since Linux 2.4.11)
              Perform  a  lazy  unmount: make the mount unavailable for new accesses, immediately disconnect the
              filesystem and all filesystems mounted below it from each other and  from  the  mount  table,  and
              actually perform the unmount when the mount ceases to be busy.

       <b>MNT_EXPIRE</b> (since Linux 2.6.8)
              Mark  the mount as expired.  If a mount is not currently in use, then an initial call to <b>umount2</b>()
              with this flag fails with the error <b>EAGAIN</b>, but marks the mount as  expired.   The  mount  remains
              expired  as  long  as  it  isn't  accessed  by  any  process.   A second <b>umount2</b>() call specifying
              <b>MNT_EXPIRE</b> unmounts an expired mount.  This flag cannot be  specified  with  either  <b>MNT_FORCE</b>  or
              <b>MNT_DETACH</b>.

       <b>UMOUNT_NOFOLLOW</b> (since Linux 2.6.34)
              Don't  dereference  <u>target</u>  if  it  is  a symbolic link.  This flag allows security problems to be
              avoided in set-user-ID-<u>root</u> programs that allow unprivileged users to unmount filesystems.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The error values given below result from filesystem type independent errors.  Each  filesystem  type  may
       have its own special errors and its own special behavior.  See the Linux kernel source code for details.

       <b>EAGAIN</b> A call to <b>umount2</b>() specifying <b>MNT_EXPIRE</b> successfully marked an unbusy filesystem as expired.

       <b>EBUSY</b>  <u>target</u> could not be unmounted because it is busy.

       <b>EFAULT</b> <u>target</u> points outside the user address space.

       <b>EINVAL</b> <u>target</u> is not a mount point.

       <b>EINVAL</b> <u>target</u> is locked; see <b><a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces</a></b>(7).

       <b>EINVAL</b> <b>umount2</b>() was called with <b>MNT_EXPIRE</b> and either <b>MNT_DETACH</b> or <b>MNT_FORCE</b>.

       <b>EINVAL</b> (since Linux 2.6.34)
              <b>umount2</b>() was called with an invalid flag value in <u>flags</u>.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              A pathname was longer than <b>MAXPATHLEN</b>.

       <b>ENOENT</b> A pathname was empty or had a nonexistent component.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> The kernel could not allocate a free page to copy filenames or data into.

       <b>EPERM</b>  The caller does not have the required privileges.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       Linux.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>MNT_DETACH</b> and <b>MNT_EXPIRE</b> are available since glibc 2.11.

       The  original  <b>umount</b>()  function  was called as <u>umount(device)</u> and would return <b>ENOTBLK</b> when called with
       something other than a block device.  In Linux 0.98p4, a call <u>umount(dir)</u> was added, in order to  support
       anonymous  devices.   In Linux 2.3.99-pre7, the call <u>umount(device)</u> was removed, leaving only <u>umount(dir)</u>
       (since now devices can be mounted in more than one place, so specifying the device does not suffice).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>umount()</b> <b>and</b> <b>shared</b> <b>mounts</b>
       Shared mounts cause any mount activity on a mount, including <b>umount</b>()  operations,  to  be  forwarded  to
       every  shared mount in the peer group and every slave mount of that peer group.  This means that <b>umount</b>()
       of any peer in a set of shared mounts will cause all of its peers to be unmounted and all of their slaves
       to be unmounted as well.

       This propagation of unmount activity can be particularly surprising  on  systems  where  every  mount  is
       shared  by default.  On such systems, recursively bind mounting the root directory of the filesystem onto
       a subdirectory and then later unmounting that subdirectory with <b>MNT_DETACH</b> will cause every mount in  the
       mount namespace to be lazily unmounted.

       To  ensure  <b>umount</b>() does not propagate in this fashion, the mount may be remounted using a <b><a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount</a></b>(2) call
       with a <u>mount_flags</u> argument that includes both <b>MS_REC</b> and <b>MS_PRIVATE</b> prior to <b>umount</b>() being called.
