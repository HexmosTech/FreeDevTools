</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mount, nmount, unmount — mount or dismount a file system

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/param.h&gt;</b>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/mount.h&gt;</b>

       <u>int</u>
       <b>mount</b>(<u>const</u> <u>char</u> <u>*type</u>, <u>const</u> <u>char</u> <u>*dir</u>, <u>int</u> <u>flags</u>, <u>void</u> <u>*data</u>);

       <u>int</u>
       <b>unmount</b>(<u>const</u> <u>char</u> <u>*dir</u>, <u>int</u> <u>flags</u>);

       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/uio.h&gt;</b>

       <u>int</u>
       <b>nmount</b>(<u>struct</u> <u>iovec</u> <u>*iov</u>, <u>u_int</u> <u>niov</u>, <u>int</u> <u>flags</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>mount</b>()  system  call  grafts  a file system object onto the system file tree at the point <u>dir</u>.  The
       argument <u>data</u> describes the file system object to be mounted.  The argument <u>type</u> tells the kernel how  to
       interpret  <u>data</u> (See <u>type</u> below).  The contents of the file system become available through the new mount
       point <u>dir</u>.  Any files in <u>dir</u> at the time of a successful mount are swept under the carpet  so  to  speak,
       and are unavailable until the file system is unmounted.

       The  <b>nmount</b>()  system  call behaves similarly to <b>mount</b>(), except that the mount options (file system type
       name, device to mount, mount-point name, etc.) are passed as an array of name-value pairs  in  the  array
       <u>iov</u>, containing <u>niov</u> elements.  The following options are required by all file systems:

             <b>fstype</b>    file system type name (e.g., “<b>procfs</b>”)
             <b>fspath</b>    mount point pathname (e.g., “<b><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></b>”)

       Depending  on  the file system type, other options may be recognized or required; for example, most disk-
       based file systems require a “<b>from</b>” option containing the pathname of a special device in addition to the
       options listed above.

       By default only the super-user may call the <b>mount</b>() system call.  This  restriction  can  be  removed  by
       setting  the  <u>vfs.usermount</u>  <u><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></u>(8)  variable  to  a  non-zero  value;  see  the BUGS section for more
       information.

       The following <u>flags</u> may be specified to suppress default semantics which affect file system access.

       MNT_RDONLY       The file system should be treated as read-only; even the super-user may not write on it.
                        Specifying MNT_UPDATE without this option  will  upgrade  a  read-only  file  system  to
                        read/write.

       MNT_NOEXEC       Do not allow files to be executed from the file system.

       MNT_NOSUID       Do  not  honor  setuid  or  setgid  bits on files when executing them.  This flag is set
                        automatically when the caller is not the super-user.

       MNT_NOATIME      Disable update of file access times.

       MNT_SNAPSHOT     Create a snapshot of the file system.  This is currently only  supported  on  UFS2  file
                        systems, see <u><a href="../man8/mksnap_ffs.8.html">mksnap_ffs</a></u>(8) for more information.

       MNT_SUIDDIR      Directories  with  the  SUID  bit  set  chown  new  files to their own owner.  This flag
                        requires the SUIDDIR option to have been compiled into the kernel to  have  any  effect.
                        See the <u><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></u>(8) and <u><a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</a></u>(2) pages for more information.

       MNT_SYNCHRONOUS  All I/O to the file system should be done synchronously.

       MNT_ASYNC        All I/O to the file system should be done asynchronously.

       MNT_FORCE        Force  a  read-write  mount  even  if the file system appears to be unclean.  Dangerous.
                        Together with MNT_UPDATE and MNT_RDONLY, specify that the file system is to be  forcibly
                        downgraded to a read-only mount even if some files are open for writing.

       MNT_NOCLUSTERR   Disable read clustering.

       MNT_NOCLUSTERW   Disable write clustering.

       The  flag MNT_UPDATE indicates that the mount command is being applied to an already mounted file system.
       This allows the mount flags to be changed without  requiring  that  the  file  system  be  unmounted  and
       remounted.  Some file systems may not allow all flags to be changed.  For example, many file systems will
       not allow a change from read-write to read-only.

       The  flag  MNT_RELOAD  causes the vfs subsystem to update its data structures pertaining to the specified
       already mounted file system.

       The <u>type</u> argument names the file system.  The types of file systems known to the system can  be  obtained
       with <u><a href="../man1/lsvfs.1.html">lsvfs</a></u>(1).

       The  <u>data</u>  argument  is a pointer to a structure that contains the type specific arguments to mount.  The
       format for these argument structures is described in the manual page for each file system.  By convention
       file system manual pages are named by prefixing ``mount_'' to the name of the file system as returned  by
       <u><a href="../man1/lsvfs.1.html">lsvfs</a></u>(1).   Thus  the  NFS  file system is described by the <u><a href="../man8/mount_nfs.8.html">mount_nfs</a></u>(8) manual page.  It should be noted
       that a manual page for default file systems, known as UFS and UFS2, does not exist.

       The <b>unmount</b>() system call disassociates the file system from the specified mount point <u>dir</u>.

       The <u>flags</u> argument may include MNT_FORCE to specify that the file system  should  be  forcibly  unmounted
       even if files are still active.  Active special devices continue to work, but any further accesses to any
       other active files result in errors even if the file system is later remounted.

       If  the MNT_BYFSID flag is specified, <u>dir</u> should instead be a file system ID encoded as “<b>FSID</b>:<u>val0</u>:<u>val1</u>”,
       where <u>val0</u> and <u>val1</u> are the contents of the <u>fsid_t</u> <u>val[]</u> array in decimal.  The file system that has  the
       specified file system ID will be unmounted.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful  completion,  the value 0 is returned; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global
       variable <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>mount</b>() and <b>nmount</b>() system calls will fail when one of the following occurs:

       [EPERM]            The caller is neither the super-user nor the owner of <u>dir</u>.

       [ENOMEM]           Not  enough  memory  was available to read the cylinder group information for the file
                          system.

       [EIO]              An I/O error occurred while reading the super block or cylinder group information.

                          allocated address space.

       The <b>unmount</b>() system call may fail with one of the following errors:

       [EPERM]            The caller is neither the super-user nor the user who issued the corresponding <b>mount</b>()
                          call.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]     The length of the path name exceeded 1023 characters.

       [EINVAL]           The requested directory is not in the mount table.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>mount</b>()  and  <b>unmount</b>()  functions  appeared in Version 1 AT&amp;T UNIX.  The <b>nmount</b>() system call first
       appeared in FreeBSD 5.0.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Some of the error codes need translation to more obvious messages.

       Allowing untrusted users to mount  arbitrary  media,  e.g.  by  enabling  <u>vfs.usermount</u>,  should  not  be
       considered safe.  Most file systems in FreeBSD were not built to safeguard against malicious devices.
