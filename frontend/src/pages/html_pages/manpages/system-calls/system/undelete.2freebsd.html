</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       undelete — attempt to recover a deleted file

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;</b>

       <u>int</u>
       <b>undelete</b>(<u>const</u> <u>char</u> <u>*path</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>undelete</b>()  system  call  attempts to recover the deleted file named by <u>path</u>.  Currently, this works
       only when the named object is a whiteout in a union file system.  The system call  removes  the  whiteout
       causing any objects in a lower layer of the union stack to become visible once more.

       Eventually,  the  <b>undelete</b>()  functionality may be expanded to other file systems able to recover deleted
       files such as the log-structured file system.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>undelete</b>() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1  is  returned  and  the
       global variable <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>undelete</b>() succeeds unless:

       [ENOTDIR]          A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]     A  component  of  a  pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an entire path name exceeded
                          1023 characters.

       [EEXIST]           The path does not reference a whiteout.

       [ENOENT]           The named whiteout does not exist.

       [EACCES]           Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.

       [EACCES]           Write permission is denied on the directory containing the name to be undeleted.

       [ELOOP]            Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.

       [EPERM]            The directory containing the name is marked sticky, and the  containing  directory  is
                          not owned by the effective user ID.

       [EINVAL]           The last component of the path is ‘..’.

       [EIO]              An I/O error occurred while updating the directory entry.

       [EINTEGRITY]       Corrupted data was detected while reading from the file system.

       [EROFS]            The name resides on a read-only file system.

       [EFAULT]           The <u>path</u> argument points outside the process's allocated address space.

       The <b>undelete</b>() system call first appeared in 4.4BSD-Lite.
