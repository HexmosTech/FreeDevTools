</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       uuidgen — generate universally unique identifiers

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/uuid.h&gt;</b>

       <u>int</u>
       <b>uuidgen</b>(<u>struct</u> <u>uuid</u> <u>*store</u>, <u>int</u> <u>count</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>uuidgen</b>()  system call generates <u>count</u> universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) and writes them to the
       buffer pointed to by <u>store</u>.  The identifiers are generated according to the syntax and semantics  of  the
       DCE  version  1  variant of universally unique identifiers.  See below for a more in-depth description of
       the identifiers.  When no IEEE 802 address is available for the node field, a random multicast address is
       generated for each invocation of the system call.  According to the algorithm  of  generating  time-based
       UUIDs,  this  will  also  force  a  new  random clock sequence, thereby increasing the likelihood for the
       identifier to be unique.

       When multiple identifiers are to be  generated,  the  <b>uuidgen</b>()  system  call  will  generate  a  set  of
       identifiers  that  is  dense  in  such a way that there is no identifier that is larger than the smallest
       identifier in the set and smaller than the largest identifier in the set and that is not already  in  the
       set.

       Universally  unique  identifiers,  also  known  as  globally  unique  identifiers  (GUIDs), have a binary
       representation of 128-bits.  The grouping and meaning  of  these  bits  is  described  by  the  following
       structure and its description of the fields that follow it:

       struct uuid {
               uint32_t        time_low;
               uint16_t        time_mid;
               uint16_t        time_hi_and_version;
               uint8_t         clock_seq_hi_and_reserved;
               uint8_t         clock_seq_low;
               uint8_t         node[_UUID_NODE_LEN];
       };

       <u>time_low</u>                   The  least significant 32 bits of a 60-bit timestamp.  This field is stored in
                                  the native byte-order.

       <u>time_mid</u>                   The least significant 16 bits of the most significant 28 bits  of  the  60-bit
                                  timestamp.  This field is stored in the native byte-order.

       <u>time_hi_and_version</u>        The  most significant 12 bits of the 60-bit timestamp multiplexed with a 4-bit
                                  version number.  The version number is stored in the most significant  4  bits
                                  of the 16-bit field.  This field is stored in the native byte-order.

       <u>clock_seq_hi_and_reserved</u>  The  most  significant  6  bits of a 14-bit sequence number multiplexed with a
                                  2-bit variant value.  Note that the width of the variant value  is  determined
                                  by  the  variant  itself.   Identifiers generated by the <b>uuidgen</b>() system call
                                  have variant value 10b.  the variant value is stored in the  most  significant
                                  bits of the field.

       <u>clock_seq_low</u>              The least significant 8 bits of a 14-bit sequence number.

       <u>node</u>                       The 6-byte IEEE 802 (MAC) address of one of the interfaces of the node.  If no
                                  such interface exists, a random multi-cast address is used instead.

       The  binary  representation  is  sensitive to byte ordering.  Any multi-byte field is to be stored in the
       local or native byte-order and identifiers must be converted when transmitted to hosts that do not  agree
       on  the byte-order.  The specification does not however document what this means in concrete terms and is
       otherwise beyond the scope of this system call.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, the value 0 is returned; otherwise the value -1 is returned  and  the  global
       variable <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>uuidgen</b>() system call can fail with:

       [EFAULT]           The buffer pointed to by <u>store</u> could not be written to for any or all identifiers.

       [EINVAL]           The <u>count</u> argument is less than 1 or larger than the hard upper limit of 2048.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man1/uuidgen.1.html">uuidgen</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man3/uuid.3.html">uuid</a></u>(3)

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       The  identifiers  are  represented  and generated in conformance with the DCE 1.1 RPC specification.  The
       <b>uuidgen</b>() system call is itself not part of the specification.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>uuidgen</b>() system call first appeared in FreeBSD 5.0.
