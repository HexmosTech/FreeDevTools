       SELinux - Golf documentation (SELinux)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If you do not use SELinux, you can ignore this.

       SELinux  is MAC (Mandatory Access Control) system, which means anything that isn't allowed is prohibited.
       This is as opposed to DAC, Discretionary Access  Control,  where  everything  is  allowed  except  what's
       prohibited.  MAC generally works on top of DAC, and they are expected to work in a complementary fashion.
       Golf deploys both methods for enhanced security.

       Golf comes with a SELinux policy out-of-the-box, which covers its general functioning. However,  you  can
       write  any  code  with Golf, and if you are using SELinux, you may run afoul of its other policies, which
       may not be conducive to your code. In that case, use temporarily a permissive mode (via setenforce),  and
       then audit2allow to get a clue on what is the issue and then take action to allow what's requested.

       Note that OpenSUSE package does not come with SELinux policy as of this release, because OpenSUSE at this
       time does not come with a default base policy and SELinux installation.

       <b>GENERAL</b>

       Golf policy files (including .te, .fc files, while .if file is empty) can be found here:

           ls $(gg -l)/selinux/*.{te,fc}

       As a part of installing Golf, the following SELinux types will be installed:

           • ggfile_t: all files within Golf directory (/var/lib/gg) are labeled with this type.

           •  gg_t: domain type (process type) of all Golf executables that communicate with other processes (be
           it Unix or TCP sockets). Only files labeled ggfile_t can run as this process type.

           • ggport_t: port type that any Golf process is allowed to  bind  to,  accept  and  listen.  No  other
           process types are allowed to do so.  Golf policy:

               •  allows  Golf  processes  unconfined  access.  This  is  expected  as Golf is a general purpose
               framework. It means you do not have to do anything to connect to database, use files, connect  to
               other servers etc.

               •  allows web servers (httpd_t domain type) to connect to sockets labeled with ggfile_t, but does
               not allow any other access. This allows communication between reverse-proxy web servers and  Golf
               applications.

               • allows web servers to connect to any Golf process that is listening on a TCP port (see <b>gg</b>), but
               does not allow any other access (i.e. to any other ports).  Golf policy allows normal functioning
               of  Golf  features  only,  but  does  not introduce any unnecessary privileges to the rest of the
               system.

               Note: Golf installation does not distribute  .pp  (compile)  policy  files,  because  it  is  not
               currently  part  of  distro repos. Due to changes in SELinux and difference in versions installed
               across derived distros, Golf will compile source .te  and  .fc  files  during  the  installation,
               ensuring the best possibility of successful SELinux policy setup.

               <b>UNIX</b> <b>DOMAIN</b> <b>SOCKETS</b>

               Using  Unix  domain  sockets  for Golf processes to communicate with a web server (see <b>gg</b>) is the
               default method and no further action is needed.

               <b>UNIX</b> <b>TCP</b> <b>SOCKETS</b>

               Using TCP sockets for Golf processes to communicate with a web server (see <b>gg</b>)  requires  you  to
               label such ports as ggport_t, for example if you plan to use port 2109:

                   sudo semanage port -a -t ggport_t -p tcp  2109

               When  you  no  longer need a port, for example if you are switching to another port (for instance
               2209), remove the old one and add the new one:

                   sudo semanage port -d -t ggport_t -p tcp  2109
                   sudo semanage port -a -t ggport_t -p tcp  2209

               <b>CHANGING</b> <b>OR</b> <b>ADDING</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b>

               If you are adding directories to be used by Golf program, or changing a  directory,  for  example
               using  a  different  storage instead of /var/lib/gg (see <b>directories</b>), you need to label files in
               new directories:

                   sudo semanage fcontext -a -t ggfile_t "/your/new/dir(<a href="file:/.">/.</a>*)?"
                   sudo restorecon -R /your/new/dir

               To remove context from such directories (if you are not using them anymore), use:

                   sudo semanage fcontext -d -t ggfile_t "/your/new/dir(<a href="file:/.">/.</a>*)?"
                   sudo restorecon -R /your/new/dir
