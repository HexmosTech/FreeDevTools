</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       chroot — change root directory

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;</b>

       <u>int</u>
       <b>chroot</b>(<u>const</u> <u>char</u> <u>*dirname</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>dirname</u>  argument  is  the  address of the pathname of a directory, terminated by an ASCII NUL.  The
       <b>chroot</b>() system call causes <u>dirname</u> to become the root directory, that is, the starting  point  for  path
       searches of pathnames beginning with ‘/’.

       In  order  for  a  directory to become the root directory a process must have execute (search) access for
       that directory.

       It should be noted that <b>chroot</b>() has no effect on the process's current directory.

       This call is restricted to the super-user.

       Depending  on  the  setting   of   the   ‘kern.chroot_allow_open_directories’   sysctl   variable,   open
       filedescriptors which reference directories will make the <b>chroot</b>() fail as follows:

       If ‘kern.chroot_allow_open_directories’ is set to zero, <b>chroot</b>() will always fail with EPERM if there are
       any directories open.

       If  ‘kern.chroot_allow_open_directories’  is  set  to one (the default), <b>chroot</b>() will fail with EPERM if
       there are any directories open and the process is already subject to the <b>chroot</b>() system call.

       Any other value for ‘kern.chroot_allow_open_directories’ will bypass the check for open directories

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, the value 0 is returned; otherwise the value -1 is returned  and  the  global
       variable <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>chroot</b>() system call will fail and the root directory will be unchanged if:

       [ENOTDIR]          A component of the path name is not a directory.

       [EPERM]            The  effective  user ID is not the super-user, or one or more filedescriptors are open
                          directories.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]     A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an  entire  path  name  exceeded
                          1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]           The named directory does not exist.

       [EACCES]           Search permission is denied for any component of the path name.

       [ELOOP]            Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.

       [EFAULT]           The <u>dirname</u> argument points outside the process's allocated address space.

       [EIO]              An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.

       [EINTEGRITY]       Corrupted data was detected while reading from the file system.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>chroot</b>() system call appeared in Version 7 AT&amp;T UNIX.  It was marked as “legacy” in Version 2 of the
       Single UNIX Specification (“SUSv2”), and was removed in subsequent standards.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If the process is able to change its working directory  to  the  target  directory,  but  another  access
       control  check  fails  (such  as  a check for open directories, or a MAC check), it is possible that this
       system call may return an error, with the working directory of the process left changed.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b> <b>CONSIDERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The system have many hardcoded paths to files where  it  may  load  after  the  process  starts.   It  is
       generally  recommended  to drop privileges immediately after a successful <b>chroot</b> call, and restrict write
       access to a limited subtree of the <b>chroot</b> root, for instance, setup the sandbox  so  that  the  sandboxed
       user will have no write access to any well-known system directories.
