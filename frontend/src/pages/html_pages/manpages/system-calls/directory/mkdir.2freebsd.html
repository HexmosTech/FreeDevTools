</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mkdir, mkdirat — make a directory file

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</b>

       <u>int</u>
       <b>mkdir</b>(<u>const</u> <u>char</u> <u>*path</u>, <u>mode_t</u> <u>mode</u>);

       <u>int</u>
       <b>mkdirat</b>(<u>int</u> <u>fd</u>, <u>const</u> <u>char</u> <u>*path</u>, <u>mode_t</u> <u>mode</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  directory  <u>path</u>  is  created  with  the  access  permissions specified by <u>mode</u> and restricted by the
       <u><a href="../man2/umask.2.html">umask</a></u>(2) of the calling process.

       The directory's owner ID is set to the process's effective user ID.  The directory's group ID is  set  to
       that of the parent directory in which it is created.

       The  <b>mkdirat</b>()  system  call  is equivalent to <b>mkdir</b>() except in the case where <u>path</u> specifies a relative
       path.  In this case the newly created directory is created relative to the directory associated with  the
       file  descriptor  <u>fd</u>  instead of the current working directory.  If <b>mkdirat</b>() is passed the special value
       AT_FDCWD in the <u>fd</u> parameter, the current working directory is used and the behavior is  identical  to  a
       call to <b>mkdir</b>().

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>mkdir</b>() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global
       variable <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>mkdir</b>() system call will fail and no directory will be created if:

       [ENOTDIR]          A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]     A  component  of  a  pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an entire path name exceeded
                          1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]           A component of the path prefix does not exist.

       [EACCES]           Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix, or write permission is
                          denied on the parent directory of the directory to be created.

       [ELOOP]            Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.

       [EPERM]            The parent directory of the directory to be created has its immutable  flag  set,  see
                          the <u><a href="../man2/chflags.2.html">chflags</a></u>(2) manual page for more information.

       [EROFS]            The named directory would reside on a read-only file system.

       [EMLINK]           The  new  directory  cannot  be created because the parent directory contains too many
                          subdirectories.

       [EEXIST]           The named file exists.

       [ENOSPC]           The new directory cannot be created because there is no space left on the file  system
                          that will contain the directory.

       [ENOSPC]           There are no free inodes on the file system on which the directory is being created.

       [EDQUOT]           The  new  directory  cannot  be created because the user's quota of disk blocks on the
                          file system that will contain the directory has been exhausted.

       [EDQUOT]           The user's quota of inodes on the file system on which the directory is being  created
                          has been exhausted.

       [EIO]              An I/O error occurred while making the directory entry or allocating the inode.

       [EIO]              An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.

       [EINTEGRITY]       Corrupted data was detected while reading from the file system.

       [EFAULT]           The <u>path</u> argument points outside the process's allocated address space.

       In addition to the errors returned by the <b>mkdir</b>(), the <b>mkdirat</b>() may fail if:

       [EBADF]            The  <u>path</u>  argument  does  not specify an absolute path and the <u>fd</u> argument is neither
                          AT_FDCWD nor a valid file descriptor open for searching.

       [ENOTDIR]          The <u>path</u> argument is not an absolute path and  <u>fd</u>  is  neither  AT_FDCWD  nor  a  file
                          descriptor associated with a directory.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>mkdir</b>() system call is expected to conform to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990 (“POSIX.1”).  The <b>mkdirat</b>() system
       call follows The Open Group Extended API Set 2 specification.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>mkdirat</b>() system call appeared in FreeBSD 8.0.  The <b>mkdir</b>() system call appeared in  Version  1  AT&amp;T
       UNIX.
