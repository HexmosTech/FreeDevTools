       error-code - Golf documentation (error-handling)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Many  Golf  statements  return  status  with GG_ERR_... error codes, which are generally descriptive to a
       point. Such status may not as detailed as the operating system "errno"  variable,  however  you  can  use
       "errno"  clause in <b>get-req</b> statement to obtain the last known errno value from aforementioned statements.
       You should obtain this value as soon as possible after the statement because another statement may set it
       afterwards.

       In the following example, a directory is attempted to be deleted via <b>delete-file</b>, which  will  fail  with
       GG_ERR_DELETE  -  however  you  can  get a more specific code via "errno" (which in this case is "21", or
       "EISDIR", which means that it cannot delete a directory with this statement):

           delete-file "some_directory" status stc
           if-true stc equal GG_ERR_DELETE
               get-req errno to e
               @Cannot delete file
               print-format "Error %ld\n", e
           end-if

       Note that with some GG_ERR_... codes, the "errno" clause in get-req may return 0. This  means  the  error
       was detected by Golf and not reported by the operating system.

       You  can  use  standard Linux constants, as defined in C "errno.h" include file to compare the error code
       obtained with get-req. For instance, you can use constants like EACCES  or  EEXIST.  To  see  what's  the
       meaning of errno number or name, use standard Linux utility "errno".
