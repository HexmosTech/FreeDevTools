       error-handling - Golf documentation (error-handling)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>WHEN</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>PROGRAM</b> <b>ERRORS</b> <b>OUT</b>

       "Erroring out" means a process handling a request has encountered a difficulty that cannot be handled and
       it will either:

           •  Skip the rest of the request, and move on quickly to handle the next request without exiting. Most
           errors are like this, for example your program has attempted  to  access  memory  outside  of  what's
           allocated, or you have called <b>report-error</b> statement.

           •  Stop  and exit, and it may be automatically restarted if it's a <b>service</b>. For instance, the process
           could be out of memory, or the database is permanently down and connection cannot be re-established.
       Note that if your program is <b>command-line</b>, it will exit in any case since it  handles  a  single  request
       anyway.

       <b>WHEN</b> <b>THERE</b> <b>IS</b> <b>A</b> <b>PROBLEM</b> <b>IN</b> <b>GOLF</b>

       If  there  is  a fatal internal error (i.e. error in Golf code itself that cannot be handled), it will be
       caught by Golf, and the process will end. If your process is started with <b>mgrg</b>, it may  be  automatically
       restarted.

       <b>LOGGING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>ERROR</b>

       Regardless  of  the type of error and regardless of whether the process exits or not, the error is logged
       and the program stack with full source code lines (see  <b>gg</b>  for  including  debug  information)  will  be
       written  to  backtrace  file (use -e option of <b>gg</b> to obtain its location). Note that the program stack is
       logged only if debugging info is present (i.e. if installed  from  package  you  must  install  debugging
       package as well).

       You  can  see the list of last N errors (and the location of file containing backtrace for them) by using
       <b>gg</b>, for instance to see the last 3 errors:

           gg -e 3
