       <b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>

           •  -k  &lt;app name&gt; Create Golf application &lt;app name&gt; with default settings (see <b>mgrg</b> with "-i" option
           on creating applications with non-default settings). The default settings mean that your  application
           is  owned by the currently-logged on Operating System user (see "-u" option in mgrg), and that a Unix
           socket connecting to your application server isn't restricted by any group (see "-r" option in mgrg).
           You must have sudo privilege to create an application (this is the only  option  that  requires  it).
           This  option does nothing if the application already exists. You can combine this option with "-q" to
           create and then build an application in the same step.

           • -q Build Golf application from source code in the current directory. <b>mgrg</b> must run  first  in  this
           directory  with  "-i"  option  to create the application. You must have at least one Golf source file
           (.golf file), with each such file implementing a single <b>request</b> handler. All application source files
           must be contained in a flat directory; however, each request  handler  can  handle  any  hierarchical
           path, so your API can be fully hierarchical.

           The following options can be used when building an application:

               •  --db="&lt;database  vendor&gt;:&lt;db  config  file&gt;  ..."   Specify  a  list of databases used in your
               application. Each element of the list is &lt;database vendor&gt; (which  is  'mariadb',  'postgres'  or
               'sqlite'),  followed  by a colon (:) and then &lt;db config file&gt;, where &lt;db config file&gt; is used to
               refer to a database in <b>statements</b> such as <b>run-query</b>.

               Each &lt;database vendor&gt;:&lt;db config file&gt; is separated by a space.  You  can  list  any  number  of
               databases  for  use  in  your application. A file in current directory with name &lt;db config file&gt;
               must exist and contain the connection parameters for database access, and  is  copied  to  Golf's
               database  configuration directory (see <b>directories</b>). See <b>database-config-file</b> for more details on
               the content of this file.

               • --lflag=&lt;linker flags&gt; If you wish to add any additional linker flags  (such  as  any  non-Golf
               libraries), specify them quoted under this option.

               • --cflag=&lt;C flags&gt; If you wish to add any additional C compiler (gcc) flags, specify them quoted
               under this option.

               •  --trace  If  specified, tracing information code will be generated (without it, tracing is not
               available and <b>trace-run</b> statement is ignored). Tracing only works when debugging mode is enabled,
               so --debug option must be used as well.

               • --path=&lt;application path&gt; This option lets you specify the <b>application</b> <b>path</b>  for  your  request
               URLs.  It  is  a  leading  path  of a URL prior to request name and any parameters. If empty, the
               default is the application name preceded by a forward slash:

                   /&lt;app name&gt;

               • --maxupload=&lt;max upload size&gt; Specify maximum upload size for a file (in bytes). The default is
               approximately 25MB.

               • --max-errors=&lt;max errors&gt; During building of C code precompiled from  .golf  source  code,  gcc
               will  emit a maximum of &lt;max errors&gt; diagnostic messages per .golf source file. The default is 5.
               Note that Golf precompiler stops after the first error in most cases  and  this  setting  doesn't
               apply to it.

               •  --debug Debugging information is always included in Golf executables, even if in separate .dbg
               (or .debug) files. "--debug" flag is only necessary if tracing is used (see <b>trace-run</b>),  as  well
               as  to  include  additional  run-time checks. Do not use "--debug" unless you are a Golf upstream
               developer or maintainer, because it may significantly lower the run-time performance.

               • --c-lines Skip generating  line  information  when  compiling  .golf  files.  By  default  line
               information  is included, which allows errors to be reported with line numbers in .golf files. If
               you want only generated C code line numbers to be used, use this option. This  output  will  omit
               certain color-coded and other details that are normally present without this option.

               • --public Change the default behavior of request handler safety so that request handlers without
               "public" or "private" clause are by default "public"; see <b>begin-handler</b> for more details.

               •  --single-file  A  request  handler  is  written  in  a source file whose path matches fully or
               partially that of the <b>request</b>, and such a file can contain any number of  request  handlers  that
               match,  see  <b>request</b>. If, however "--single-file" is used, each request has to be in its own file
               whose path matches fully the request path, and no other request can be implemented in such  file.
               For  example, with "--single-file", request "/myreq" has to be in file "myreq.golf" in the source
               directory, while request "/other/newreq" has to be in file "other/newreq.golf" (meaning  in  file
               "newreq.golf" in subdirectory "other" in the source directory).

               •  --exclude-dir By default, all ".golf" files (including in all subdirectories regardless of how
               many levels there may be), are picked up for compilation. If "--exclude-dir" is  used,  then  you
               can specify any number of subdirectories, separated by commas, to be excluded.

               • --ignore-warn Do not display any warnings during compilation of a Golf application.

               •  --parallel=&lt;threads&gt;  Use  &lt;threads&gt; number of threads to compile application. By default, the
               number of threads is equal to the number of  CPUs  (including  virtual),  allowing  each  CPU  to
               compile  one  source  files  at  a  time;  this  is  usually  the  fastest way. You can serialize
               compilation with "--parallel=1"; or you can set &lt;threads&gt; to any number between 1 and three  time
               the number of CPUs in order to reach your performance and CPU utilization goals.

               •  --posix-regex  Use  ERE  (Extended  Regular  Expression)  POSIX regex library built into Linux
               instead of default PCRE2, see <b>match-regex</b>. While the two are  largely  compatible,  you  can  use
               either one depending on your needs.

               •  --plain-diag  Do not use color-coded and more detailed Golf diagnostic output. While rare, you
               may need this option in cases when there may be a Golf or underlying compiler bug,  or  for  some
               other reason.

               •  -c,--clean Clean all object and other intermediate files, so that consequent application build
               is a full recompilation. Use it alone and prior to rebuilding the application.

           Note that when any gg compilation options change, the application is rebuilt (i.e. the change has the
           effect of "--clean").

           • -i Display both include and linking flags for an application that uses  <b>Client-API</b>  to  connect  to
           Golf  <b>service</b>.  The  flags  are for C compiler (gcc). If "--include" option is used in addition, then
           only include flags are displayed. If "--link" option is used in addition, then only linking flags are
           displayed. Use this to automate building of client applications with tools like Makefile.

           • -v Display Golf version as well as the Operating System version.

           • -s Trace the execution of gg utility and display all the steps in making your application.

           • -e &lt;num of errors&gt; Show the last &lt;num of errors&gt; from the  backtrace  file,  which  receives  error
           message  and  stack  trace  when  program crashes or <b>report-error</b> is issued. Also display the path to
           backtrace file which contains the stack details.

           • -t &lt;num of trace files&gt; Show the last &lt;num  of  trace  files&gt;  most  recent  trace  files  for  the
           application.  This  is useful when tracing (see <b>trace-run</b>) to quickly find the trace files where Golf
           writes to. Also display the path to backtrace file which contains the stack details.

           • -o Show documentation directory - web  page  documentation  is  located  here  in  the  form  of  a
           golfdoc.html file.

           • -g Show Golf root directory (i.e. where Golf is installed, see <b>directories</b>).

           • -l Show library directory - Golf's libraries and v1 code processor are located there.

           • -r [ --req="/&lt;request name&gt;[&lt;url parameters&gt;]"
               [ --app="application path" ]
               [ --service [ --remote="server:port" ] [ --socket="socket path" ] ]
               [ --method="&lt;request method&gt;" ]
               [ --content="&lt;input file&gt;" --content-type="&lt;content type&gt;" ]
               [ --silent-header ]
               [ --arg="&lt;arguments&gt;" ]
               [  --exec ] Run a <b>command-line</b> program, or make a <b>service</b> request, or display bash code to do the
           same for use in scripts.

           If you are not in application's source code directory, then you must specify "--app" option to supply
           the application path (typically "/&lt;application name&gt;", see <b>request</b>). You can use  "--req"  option  to
           specify the request name and optional URL parameters (see <b>request</b>), for example it may be:

               gg -r --req="/encrypt" --exec

           to execute request "encrypt", or

               gg -r --req="/encrypt/data=somedata?method=aes256" --exec

           where  "/encrypt"  is  the  request  name,  and  "/data=somedata?method=aes256"  represents  the  URL
           parameters.

           Use --method to specify the HTTP request method, for instance:

               gg -r --req="/encrypt/data=somedata?method=aes256" --method=POST --exec

           If not specified, the default method is "GET".

           If "--service" is not used, then <b>command-line</b> program  will  execute  and  you  can  specify  program
           arguments with "--arg" option, in which case "&lt;arguments&gt;" is a string (double or single quoted) that
           contains any number of program arguments. To specify arguments for a service see "-a" option in <b>mgrg</b>.

           If  "--service" is used, then application server will be contacted to execute a service; in this case
           if "--remote" is not specified, a local  Unix  socket  is  used  to  contact  the  server;  otherwise
           "server:port"  specified  in "--remote" is the IP/name and port of the server to call, separated by a
           colon (":"). In case of a local  Unix  socket,  the  socket  path  is  by  default  "/var/lib/gg/&lt;app
           name&gt;/sock/sock",  where "/&lt;app name&gt;" is given by the last path segment in "--app" option, or if not
           specified it is derived from the name of a Golf application built in the current directory; otherwise
           the socket path is given by "--socket" option.

           By default, the output in any case will have the HTTP headers. If you don't want those to appear, use
           "--silent-header" option.

           If "--content" is used, then file &lt;input file&gt; is either piped to the standard input  of  a  command-
           line  program  (if  "--service"  is  not  used),  or  sent as a content to the application server (if
           "--service" is used). You can also specify content type with "--content-type". For example:

               gg -r -app="/my_app" --req="/some_request?par1=val1&amp;par2=20&amp;par3=4" --method=PATCH --content=something.json --content-type=application/json --exec

           Examples of using "-r" option to execute <b>command-line</b> program or to call a <b>service</b>:

               #Execute current application as a command-line program, request "json"
               gg -r --req="/json" --exec

               #Execute application "app_name", service "json" by calling the application server running with a Unix socket
               gg -r --req="/json" --app="/app_name" --service  --exec

               #Execute application "app_name", service "json" by calling the application server running with a Unix socket (specified explicitly)
               #Request has input parameter "act" with value "perf"
               gg -r --req="/json?act=perf" --app="/app_name" --service --socket="/sock_path/sock"  --exec

               #Execute application "app_name", service "json" by calling the application server running with a TCP socket on port 2301
               #Request has input parameter "act" with value "perf"
               gg -r --req="/json/act=perf" --app="/app_name" --service --remote="192.168.0.21:2301"  --exec

           <b>-</b> <b>Performance</b>

           "gg -r" can be used both for testing  and  in  production,  however  for  maximum  performance,  skip
           "--exec"  option  to  display direct bash code that you can copy and paste to use in production. This
           direct code is about 300% faster than using "gg -r"; keep this in mind if performance  of  using  "gg
           -r" is important. When "--exec" is not used, the output may look like this:

               export CONTENT_TYPE=
               export CONTENT_LENGTH=
               unset GG_SILENT_HEADER
               export GG_SILENT_HEADER
               export REQUEST_METHOD=GET
               export SCRIPT_NAME="/enc"
               export PATH_INFO="/encrypt/data/somedata"
               export QUERY_STRING="method=aes256"
               /var/lib/gg/bld/enc/enc

           If  you  copy  the  above  and  paste into bash shell, it will execute the command line program which
           handles the request specified (which gg would do when "--exec" is specified, but not as  fast).  Note
           that  SCRIPT_NAME  will  be set to whatever application path you use (i.e. the default or if set with
           "--path" option when making the application; or with "--app" option here), see <b>request</b>.

           If you need to have run-time parameter(s) to "gg -r", escape them when  displaying  the  direct  bash
           code and run with "eval", for instance:

               COMM=$(gg -r --req="/func_test/update-data/key=\$i/value=d_\$i" --service --remote="127.0.0.1:2301")
               ...
               for i in {1..1000}; do
                   ...
                   RES=$(eval "$COMM")
                   ...
                   echo "Result is $RES"
               done

           In  this  example,  the code with "$i" variable is created, and then evaluated in a bash loop of 1000
           iterations, with each execution of your service using dynamic  run-time  input  parameter  "$i",  but
           without executing "gg -r" 1000 times.

           •  -u  Read  stdin  (standard  input)  and substitute any environment variables in the form of ${&lt;var
           name&gt;} with their values, and output to stdout (stdout). This is useful in  processing  configuration
           files that do not have parameter values hardcoded, but rather take them from the environment.

           •  -m Add Golf syntax and keyword highlighting rules for files with .golf extension to Vim editor for
           the currently logged on user. Note that you must have Vim installed; vi alone will not work.

           • --man Display list of all man pages for Golf, along with the section that  each  belongs  to  (i.e.
           "string", "web", "program-flow" etc).

           • -h Display help.

       <b>EXAMPLES</b>

           •  Make  application  (-q), use three databases (--db) named mdb (MariaDB database), pdb (PostgreSQL)
           and sdb (SQLite), produce debugging information (--debug), produce tracing information (--trace):

               gg -q --db="mariadb:mdb postgres:pdb sqlite:sdb" --debug --trace

           • make application, use MariaDB database db (--db), specify linker and C compilation  flags,  specify
           maximum upload size of about 18M:

               gg -q --db="mariadb:db" --lflag "-Wl,-z,defs" --cflag "-DXYZ123" --maxupload 18000000

           • Make application that doesn't use any databases:

               gg -q
