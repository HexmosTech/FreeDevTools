</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       read-json -  (JSON-parsing)

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       Read data elements of JSON document.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
           read-json &lt;json&gt; \
               [ key &lt;key&gt; ] \
               [ value &lt;value&gt; ] \
               [ type &lt;type&gt; ] \
               [ next ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       read-json  reads  data elements from &lt;json&gt; variable, which is created with <b>json-doc</b>. A data element is a
       string &lt;key&gt;/&lt;value&gt; pair of a leaf node, where key (in "key" clause) is a normalized key name, which  is
       the  value's name preceded with the names of all objects and array members leading up to it, separated by
       a dot (".").

       The actual &lt;value&gt; is obtained with "value" clause, and the &lt;type&gt; of value can be obtained  with  "type"
       clause.

       &lt;type&gt;   is   a   number   that   can  be  GG_JSON_TYPE_STRING,  GG_JSON_TYPE_NUMBER,  GG_JSON_TYPE_REAL,
       GG_JSON_TYPE_BOOL and GG_JSON_TYPE_NULL for string, number,  real  (floating  point),  boolean  and  null
       values respectively. Note that &lt;value&gt; is always a string representation of these types.

       Use  "next"  clause  to  move  to  the  next  sequential  key/value  pair in the document, from top down.
       Typically, you would get a key first, examine if it's of interest to you, and then obtain value. This  is
       because Golf uses "lazy" approach where value is not copied until needed; with this approach JSON parsing
       is  faster.  You  can use also use "key", "value" and "next" at the same time if you're going through all
       elements.

       If there are no more data elements to read, &lt;type&gt; is GG_JSON_TYPE_NONE.

       &lt;key&gt; in "key" clause is a normalized name of any given leaf node in JSON text. This means every non-leaf
       node is included (such as arrays and objects), separated by a dot ("."),  and  arrays  are  indexed  with
       "[]". An example would be:

           "menu"."popup"."menuitem"[1]."onclick"
