</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       set-string -  (strings)

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       Set value of a string variable.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
           set-string &lt;variable&gt; [ unquoted ] [ process-scope ] [ = &lt;string&gt; ]

           set-string &lt;variable&gt; [ &lt;index&gt; ] = &lt;number&gt;

           set-string &lt;variable&gt; length &lt;length&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       String  variable  &lt;variable&gt;  will  be  assigned  a value of &lt;string&gt; if clause "=" is present; otherwise
       &lt;variable&gt; is assigned an empty string.

       If "process-scope" clause is used, then &lt;variable&gt; will be of  process  scope,  meaning  its  value  will
       persist  from  one  <b>request</b>  to  another  for  the  life  of the process; this clause can only be used if
       &lt;variable&gt; did not already exist.

       If "length" clause is used, then the length of string &lt;variable&gt; is set to &lt;length&gt;. Just like  with  all
       other  string  statements,  you  can  only  set the new length of the string between zero and the current
       string length. This is useful mostly when manipulating string's individual bytes, and  generally  not  in
       other cases (see <b>new-string</b>).

       If  "unquoted"  clause is used, then &lt;string&gt; literal is unquoted, and everything from equal clause ("=")
       to the rest of the line is a &lt;string&gt;; in this  case  there  is  no  need  to  escape  double  quotes  or
       backslashes.  Note  that  in this case, "unquoted" and any other clause must appear prior to equal clause
       ("=") and after variable, because they wouldn't otherwise be recognized. For instance:

           set-string my_string unquoted = this is "some" string where there escape characters like \n do "not work"

       This is the same as:

           set-string my_string = "this is \"some\" string where there escape characters like \n do \"not work\""

       "unquoted" clause is useful when writing string literals that would otherwise need lots of escaping.  You
       can use double backslash at the end of the line to split the line with new line in between:

           set-string unq1 unquoted =This is one line\        second line and\        third!

       The above will create a string:

           This is one line
           second line and
           third!

       A  string  can  be  represented  as  a  concatenation of string literals; this is useful when you want to
       preserve spaces, for instance:

           set-string a="something is " \
               "  very good " \
               " with spaces!! "
           // string is "something is   very good  with spaces!! "

       You can also use set-string to set a byte in it; in this case &lt;index&gt; byte in &lt;variable&gt; string is set to
       &lt;number&gt;. &lt;index&gt; starts with 0 for the first byte. For instance,  the  resulting  "str"  will  be  "Aome
       string" since 65 is a number representation of 'A':

           set-string str = "some string"
           set-string str[0] = 65
           // or using a character constant as a number, to the same effect
           set-string str[0] = 'A'

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Initialize "my_string" variable to "":

           set-string my_string

       Initialize "my_string" variable to "abc":

           set-string my_string = "abc"
