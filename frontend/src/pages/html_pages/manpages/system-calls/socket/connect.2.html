</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       connect - initiate a connection on a socket

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C library (<u>libc</u>, <u>-lc</u>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>connect(int</b> <u>sockfd</u><b>,</b> <b>const</b> <b>struct</b> <b>sockaddr</b> <b>*</b><u>addr</u><b>,</b>
                   <b>socklen_t</b> <u>addrlen</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>connect</b>()  system  call connects the socket referred to by the file descriptor <u>sockfd</u> to the address
       specified by <u>addr</u>.  The <u>addrlen</u> argument specifies the size of <u>addr</u>.  The format of the address  in  <u>addr</u>
       is determined by the address space of the socket <u>sockfd</u>; see <b><a href="../man2/socket.2.html">socket</a></b>(2) for further details.

       If  the  socket  <u>sockfd</u>  is  of  type <b>SOCK_DGRAM</b>, then <u>addr</u> is the address to which datagrams are sent by
       default, and the only address from which datagrams are received.  If the socket is of type <b>SOCK_STREAM</b> or
       <b>SOCK_SEQPACKET</b>, this call attempts to make a connection to the  socket  that  is  bound  to  the  address
       specified by <u>addr</u>.

       Some protocol sockets (e.g., UNIX domain stream sockets) may successfully <b>connect</b>() only once.

       Some  protocol  sockets  (e.g.,  datagram  sockets  in  the  UNIX and Internet domains) may use <b>connect</b>()
       multiple times to change their association.

       Some protocol sockets (e.g., TCP sockets as well as datagram sockets in the UNIX  and  Internet  domains)
       may  dissolve  the  association  by connecting to an address with the <u>sa_family</u> member of <u>sockaddr</u> set to
       <b>AF_UNSPEC</b>; thereafter, the socket can be connected to another address.   (<b>AF_UNSPEC</b>  is  supported  since
       Linux 2.2.)

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  connection or binding succeeds, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and <u>errno</u> is set to
       indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The following are general socket errors only.  There may be other domain-specific error codes.

       <b>EACCES</b> For UNIX domain sockets, which are identified by pathname:  Write  permission  is  denied  on  the
              socket  file,  or search permission is denied for one of the directories in the path prefix.  (See
              also <b><a href="../man7/path_resolution.7.html">path_resolution</a></b>(7).)

       <b>EACCES</b>
       <b>EPERM</b>  The user tried to connect to a broadcast address without having the socket broadcast flag  enabled
              or the connection request failed because of a local firewall rule.

       <b>EACCES</b> It  can  also  be  returned  if  an SELinux policy denied a connection (for example, if there is a
              policy saying that an HTTP proxy can only connect to ports associated with HTTP servers,  and  the
              proxy tries to connect to a different port).

       <b>EADDRINUSE</b>
              Local address is already in use.

       <b>EADDRNOTAVAIL</b>
              (Internet  domain  sockets)  The  socket referred to by <u>sockfd</u> had not previously been bound to an
              address and, upon attempting to bind it to an ephemeral port, it  was  determined  that  all  port
              numbers   in   the   ephemeral   port   range  are  currently  in  use.   See  the  discussion  of
              <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range">/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range</a></u> in <b><a href="../man7/ip.7.html">ip</a></b>(7).

       <b>EAFNOSUPPORT</b>
              The passed address didn't have the correct address family in its <u>sa_family</u> field.

       <b>EAGAIN</b> For nonblocking UNIX domain sockets, the socket is  nonblocking,  and  the  connection  cannot  be
              completed  immediately.   For other socket families, there are insufficient entries in the routing
              cache.

       <b>EALREADY</b>
              The socket is nonblocking and a previous connection attempt has not yet been completed.

       <b>EBADF</b>  <u>sockfd</u> is not a valid open file descriptor.

       <b>ECONNREFUSED</b>
              A <b>connect</b>() on a stream socket found no one listening on the remote address.

       <b>EFAULT</b> The socket structure address is outside the user's address space.

       <b>EINPROGRESS</b>
              The socket is nonblocking and the  connection  cannot  be  completed  immediately.   (UNIX  domain
              sockets  failed  with  <b>EAGAIN</b>  instead.)  It is possible to <b><a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a></b>(2) or <b><a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</a></b>(2) for completion by
              selecting the socket for writing.  After <b><a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a></b>(2) indicates  writability,  use  <b><a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</a></b>(2)  to
              read the <b>SO_ERROR</b> option at level <b>SOL_SOCKET</b> to determine whether <b>connect</b>() completed successfully
              (<b>SO_ERROR</b>  is  zero)  or  unsuccessfully  (<b>SO_ERROR</b>  is  one of the usual error codes listed here,
              explaining the reason for the failure).

       <b>EINTR</b>  The system call was interrupted by a signal that was caught; see <b><a href="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</a></b>(7).

       <b>EISCONN</b>
              The socket is already connected.

       <b>ENETUNREACH</b>
              Network is unreachable.

       <b>ENOTSOCK</b>
              The file descriptor <u>sockfd</u> does not refer to a socket.

       <b>EPROTOTYPE</b>
              The socket type does not support the requested communications protocol.  This error can occur, for
              example, on an attempt to connect a UNIX domain datagram socket to a stream socket.

       <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>
              Timeout while attempting connection.  The server may be too busy to accept new connections.   Note
              that for IP sockets the timeout may be very long when syncookies are enabled on the server.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.1-2008.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.1-2001, SVr4, 4.4BSD, (<b>connect</b>() first appeared in 4.2BSD).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       If  <b>connect</b>() fails, consider the state of the socket as unspecified.  Portable applications should close
       the socket and create a new one for reconnecting.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       An example of the use of <b>connect</b>() is shown in <b><a href="../man3/getaddrinfo.3.html">getaddrinfo</a></b>(3).
