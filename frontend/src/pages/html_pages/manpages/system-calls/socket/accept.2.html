       accept, accept4 - accept a connection on a socket

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C library (<u>libc</u>, <u>-lc</u>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>accept(int</b> <u>sockfd</u><b>,</b> <b>struct</b> <b>sockaddr</b> <b>*_Nullable</b> <b>restrict</b> <u>addr</u><b>,</b>
                  <b>socklen_t</b> <b>*_Nullable</b> <b>restrict</b> <u>addrlen</u><b>);</b>

       <b>#define</b> <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b>             /* See <a href="../man7/feature_test_macros.7.html">feature_test_macros</a>(7) */
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>accept4(int</b> <u>sockfd</u><b>,</b> <b>struct</b> <b>sockaddr</b> <b>*_Nullable</b> <b>restrict</b> <u>addr</u><b>,</b>
                  <b>socklen_t</b> <b>*_Nullable</b> <b>restrict</b> <u>addrlen</u><b>,</b> <b>int</b> <u>flags</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>accept</b>()  system  call is used with connection-based socket types (<b>SOCK_STREAM</b>, <b>SOCK_SEQPACKET</b>).  It
       extracts the first connection request on the queue of  pending  connections  for  the  listening  socket,
       <u>sockfd</u>,  creates a new connected socket, and returns a new file descriptor referring to that socket.  The
       newly created socket is not in the listening state.  The original socket <u>sockfd</u>  is  unaffected  by  this
       call.

       The  argument  <u>sockfd</u>  is  a  socket  that has been created with <b><a href="../man2/socket.2.html">socket</a></b>(2), bound to a local address with
       <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2), and is listening for connections after a <b><a href="../man2/listen.2.html">listen</a></b>(2).

       The argument <u>addr</u> is a pointer to a <u>sockaddr</u> structure.  This structure is filled in with the address  of
       the  peer socket, as known to the communications layer.  The exact format of the address returned <u>addr</u> is
       determined by the socket's address family (see <b><a href="../man2/socket.2.html">socket</a></b>(2) and the respective protocol  man  pages).   When
       <u>addr</u> is NULL, nothing is filled in; in this case, <u>addrlen</u> is not used, and should also be NULL.

       The  <u>addrlen</u>  argument  is a value-result argument: the caller must initialize it to contain the size (in
       bytes) of the structure pointed to by <u>addr</u>; on return it  will  contain  the  actual  size  of  the  peer
       address.

       The  returned address is truncated if the buffer provided is too small; in this case, <u>addrlen</u> will return
       a value greater than was supplied to the call.

       If no pending connections are present on the queue, and the socket is not marked as nonblocking, <b>accept</b>()
       blocks the caller until a connection is present.  If the socket is  marked  nonblocking  and  no  pending
       connections are present on the queue, <b>accept</b>() fails with the error <b>EAGAIN</b> or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>.

       In order to be notified of incoming connections on a socket, you can use <b><a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</a></b>(2), or <b><a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll</a></b>(7).
       A  readable  event will be delivered when a new connection is attempted and you may then call <b>accept</b>() to
       get a socket for that connection.  Alternatively, you can set the socket to deliver <b>SIGIO</b>  when  activity
       occurs on a socket; see <b><a href="../man7/socket.7.html">socket</a></b>(7) for details.

       If <u>flags</u> is 0, then <b>accept4</b>() is the same as <b>accept</b>().  The following values can be bitwise ORed in <u>flags</u>
       to obtain different behavior:

       <b>SOCK_NONBLOCK</b>   Set  the  <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> file status flag on the open file description (see <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2)) referred
                       to by the new file descriptor.  Using this flag saves extra calls to <b><a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</a></b>(2) to  achieve
                       the same result.

       <b>SOCK_CLOEXEC</b>    Set  the close-on-exec (<b>FD_CLOEXEC</b>) flag on the new file descriptor.  See the description
                       of the <b>O_CLOEXEC</b> flag in <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2) for reasons why this may be useful.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       On success, these system calls return a file descriptor for the accepted socket (a nonnegative  integer).
       On error, -1 is returned, <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error, and <u>addrlen</u> is left unchanged.

   <b>Error</b> <b>handling</b>
       Linux  <b>accept</b>()  (and <b>accept4</b>()) passes already-pending network errors on the new socket as an error code
       from <b>accept</b>().  This behavior differs from other BSD socket implementations.  For reliable operation  the
       application  should detect the network errors defined for the protocol after <b>accept</b>() and treat them like
       <b>EAGAIN</b> by retrying.  In the case of TCP/IP, these are <b>ENETDOWN</b>, <b>EPROTO</b>, <b>ENOPROTOOPT</b>,  <b>EHOSTDOWN</b>,  <b>ENONET</b>,
       <b>EHOSTUNREACH</b>, <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>, and <b>ENETUNREACH</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>EAGAIN</b> or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              The  socket is marked nonblocking and no connections are present to be accepted.  POSIX.1-2001 and
              POSIX.1-2008 allow either error to be returned for this case, and do not require  these  constants
              to have the same value, so a portable application should check for both possibilities.

       <b>EBADF</b>  <u>sockfd</u> is not an open file descriptor.

       <b>ECONNABORTED</b>
              A connection has been aborted.

       <b>EFAULT</b> The <u>addr</u> argument is not in a writable part of the user address space.

       <b>EINTR</b>  The system call was interrupted by a signal that was caught before a valid connection arrived; see
              <b><a href="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</a></b>(7).

       <b>EINVAL</b> Socket is not listening for connections, or <u>addrlen</u> is invalid (e.g., is negative).

       <b>EINVAL</b> (<b>accept4</b>()) invalid value in <u>flags</u>.

       <b>EMFILE</b> The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.

       <b>ENFILE</b> The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
       <b>ENOMEM</b> Not  enough  free  memory.   This  often means that the memory allocation is limited by the socket
              buffer limits, not by the system memory.

       <b>ENOTSOCK</b>
              The file descriptor <u>sockfd</u> does not refer to a socket.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The referenced socket is not of type <b>SOCK_STREAM</b>.

       <b>EPERM</b>  Firewall rules forbid connection.

       <b>EPROTO</b> Protocol error.

       In addition, network errors for the new socket and as defined for the protocol may be returned.   Various
       Linux  kernels  can  return other errors such as <b>ENOSR</b>, <b>ESOCKTNOSUPPORT</b>, <b>EPROTONOSUPPORT</b>, <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>.  The
       value <b>ERESTARTSYS</b> may be seen during a trace.

</pre><h4><b>VERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       On Linux, the new socket returned by <b>accept</b>() does <u>not</u> inherit file status flags such as  <b>O_NONBLOCK</b>  and
       <b>O_ASYNC</b>  from the listening socket.  This behavior differs from the canonical BSD sockets implementation.
       Portable programs should not rely on inheritance or  noninheritance  of  file  status  flags  and  always
       explicitly set all required flags on the socket returned from <b>accept</b>().

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>accept</b>()
              POSIX.1-2008.

       <b>accept4</b>()
              Linux.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>accept</b>()
              POSIX.1-2001, SVr4, 4.4BSD (<b>accept</b>() first appeared in 4.2BSD).

       <b>accept4</b>()
              Linux 2.6.28, glibc 2.10.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       There  may  not  always  be  a  connection  waiting  after a <b>SIGIO</b> is delivered or <b><a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</a></b>(2), or
       <b><a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll</a></b>(7) return a readability event because the connection might have been  removed  by  an  asynchronous
       network  error  or  another  thread before <b>accept</b>() is called.  If this happens, then the call will block
       waiting for the next connection to arrive.  To ensure that  <b>accept</b>()  never  blocks,  the  passed  socket
       <u>sockfd</u> needs to have the <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> flag set (see <b><a href="../man7/socket.7.html">socket</a></b>(7)).

       For  certain protocols which require an explicit confirmation, such as DECnet, <b>accept</b>() can be thought of
       as merely dequeuing the next connection request and  not  implying  confirmation.   Confirmation  can  be
       implied by a normal read or write on the new file descriptor, and rejection can be implied by closing the
       new socket.  Currently, only DECnet has these semantics on Linux.

   <b>The</b> <b>socklen_t</b> <b>type</b>
       In  the  original  BSD sockets implementation (and on other older systems) the third argument of <b>accept</b>()
       was declared as an <u>int</u> <u>*</u>.  A POSIX.1g draft standard wanted to change it into a  <u>size_t</u> <u>*</u>C;  later  POSIX
       standards and glibc 2.x have <u>socklen_t</u> <u>*</u> .
