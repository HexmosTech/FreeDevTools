</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bind — assign a local protocol address to a socket

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</b>

       <u>int</u>
       <b>bind</b>(<u>int</u> <u>s</u>, <u>const</u> <u>struct</u> <u>sockaddr</u> <u>*addr</u>, <u>socklen_t</u> <u>addrlen</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>bind</b>()  system  call  assigns the local protocol address to a socket.  When a socket is created with
       <u><a href="../man2/socket.2.html">socket</a></u>(2) it exists in an address family space but has no protocol address assigned.  The  <b>bind</b>()  system
       call requests that <u>addr</u> be assigned to the socket.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Binding  an  address  in  the UNIX domain creates a socket in the file system that must be deleted by the
       caller when it is no longer needed (using <u><a href="../man2/unlink.2.html">unlink</a></u>(2)).

       The rules used in address binding vary between communication domains.   Consult  the  manual  entries  in
       section 4 for detailed information.

       For  maximum  portability,  you  should always zero the socket address structure before populating it and
       passing it to <b>bind</b>().

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>bind</b>() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the  global
       variable <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>bind</b>() system call will fail if:

       [EAGAIN]           Kernel resources to complete the request are temporarily unavailable.

       [EBADF]            The <u>s</u> argument is not a valid descriptor.

       [EINVAL]           The  socket  is already bound to an address, and the protocol does not support binding
                          to a new address; or the socket has been shut down.

       [EINVAL]           The <u>addrlen</u> argument is not a valid length for the address family.

       [ENOTSOCK]         The <u>s</u> argument is not a socket.

       [EADDRNOTAVAIL]    The specified address is not available from the local machine.

       [EADDRINUSE]       The specified address is already in use.

       [EAFNOSUPPORT]     Addresses in the specified address family cannot be used with this socket.

       [EACCES]           The requested address is protected, and the current user has inadequate permission  to
                          access it.

       [EFAULT]           The <u>addr</u> argument is not in a valid part of the user address space.

       The following errors are specific to binding addresses in the UNIX domain.

       [ENOTDIR]    A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]
                    A  component  of  a  pathname  exceeded 255 characters, or an entire path name exceeded 1023
                    characters.

       [ENOENT]     A prefix component of the path name does not exist.

       [ELOOP]      Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.

       [EIO]        An I/O error occurred while making the directory entry or allocating the inode.

       [EINTEGRITY]
                    Corrupted data was detected while reading from the file system.

       [EROFS]      The name would reside on a read-only file system.

       [EISDIR]     An empty pathname was specified.

       The <b>bind</b>() system call appeared in 4.2BSD.
