</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       connect — initiate a connection on a socket

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</b>

       <u>int</u>
       <b>connect</b>(<u>int</u> <u>s</u>, <u>const</u> <u>struct</u> <u>sockaddr</u> <u>*name</u>, <u>socklen_t</u> <u>namelen</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>s</u>  argument  is  a socket.  If it is of type SOCK_DGRAM, this call specifies the peer with which the
       socket is to be associated; this address is that to which datagrams are to be sent, and the only  address
       from  which  datagrams  are  to be received.  If the socket is of type SOCK_STREAM, this call attempts to
       make a connection to another socket.  The other socket is specified by <u>name</u>, which is an address  in  the
       communications  space of the socket.  <u>namelen</u> indicates the amount of space pointed to by <u>name</u>, in bytes;
       the <u>sa_len</u> member of <u>name</u> is ignored.  Each communications space interprets the <u>name</u> argument in its  own
       way.   Generally, stream sockets may successfully <b>connect</b>() only once; datagram sockets may use <b>connect</b>()
       multiple times to change their association.  Datagram sockets may dissolve the association by  connecting
       to an invalid address, such as a null address.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>connect</b>()  function  returns  the  value 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the
       global variable <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>connect</b>() system call fails if:

       [EBADF]            The <u>s</u> argument is not a valid descriptor.

       [EINVAL]           The <u>namelen</u> argument is not a valid length for the address family.

       [ENOTSOCK]         The <u>s</u> argument is a descriptor for a file, not a socket.

       [EADDRNOTAVAIL]    The specified address is not available on this machine.

       [EAFNOSUPPORT]     Addresses in the specified address family cannot be used with this socket.

       [EISCONN]          The socket is already connected.

       [ETIMEDOUT]        Connection establishment timed out without establishing a connection.

       [ECONNREFUSED]     The attempt to connect was forcefully rejected.

       [ECONNRESET]       The connection was reset by the remote host.

       [ENETUNREACH]      The network is not reachable from this host.

       [EHOSTUNREACH]     The remote host is not reachable from this host.

       [EADDRINUSE]       The address is already in use.

       [EFAULT]           The <u>name</u> argument specifies an area outside the process address space.

       [EINPROGRESS]      The socket is non-blocking and the connection cannot be completed immediately.  It  is
                          possible to <u><a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a></u>(2) for completion by selecting the socket for writing.

       [EINTR]            The  connection  attempt  was interrupted by the delivery of a signal.  The connection
                          will be established in the background, as in the case of EINPROGRESS.

       [EALREADY]         A previous connection attempt has not yet been completed.

       [EACCES]           An  attempt  is  made  to  connect  to  a  broadcast  address  (obtained  through  the
                          INADDR_BROADCAST  constant or the INADDR_NONE return value) through a socket that does
                          not provide broadcast functionality.

       [EAGAIN]           An auto-assigned port number was requested but no auto-assigned ports  are  available.
                          Increasing    the    port    range    specified    by    <u><a href="../man3/sysctl.3.html">sysctl</a></u>(3)    MIB    variables
                          <u>net.inet.ip.portrange.first</u> and <u>net.inet.ip.portrange.last</u> may alleviate the problem.

       The following errors are specific to connecting names in the UNIX domain.  These errors may not apply  in
       future versions of the UNIX IPC domain.

       [ENOTDIR]          A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]     A  component  of  a  pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an entire path name exceeded
                          1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]           The named socket does not exist.

       [EACCES]           Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.

       [EACCES]           Write access to the named socket is denied.

       [ELOOP]            Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.

       [EPERM]            Write access to the named socket is denied.
