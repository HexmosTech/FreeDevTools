</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       revoke — revoke file access

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;</b>

       <u>int</u>
       <b>revoke</b>(<u>const</u> <u>char</u> <u>*path</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>revoke</b>()  system call invalidates all current open file descriptors in the system for the file named
       by <u>path</u>.  Subsequent operations on any such descriptors fail, with the exceptions that a  <b>read</b>()  from  a
       character  device file which has been revoked returns a count of zero (end of file), and a <b>close</b>() system
       call will succeed.  If the file is a special file for a device which is open, the device  close  function
       is  called  as if all open references to the file had been closed using a special close method which does
       not block.

       Access to a file may be revoked only by its owner or  the  super  user.   The  <b>revoke</b>()  system  call  is
       currently  supported only for block and character special device files.  It is normally used to prepare a
       terminal device for a new login session, preventing any access by a previous user of the terminal.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>revoke</b>() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the  value  -1  is  returned  and  the
       global variable <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Access to the named file is revoked unless one of the following:

       [ENOTDIR]          A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]     A  component  of  a  pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an entire path name exceeded
                          1024 characters.

       [ENOENT]           The named file or a component of the path name does not exist.

       [EACCES]           Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.

       [ELOOP]            Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.

       [EFAULT]           The <u>path</u> argument points outside the process's allocated address space.

       [EINVAL]           The implementation does not support the <b>revoke</b>() operation on the named file.

       [EPERM]            The caller is neither the owner of the file nor the super user.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>revoke</b>() system call first appeared in 4.3BSD-Reno.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The non-blocking close method is only correctly implemented for terminal devices.
