</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       new-list -  (linked-list)

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       Create linked list.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
           new-list &lt;list&gt; [ process-scope ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       new-list initializes new linked &lt;list&gt;, where each element is connected to the previous and next ones.

       In  a  linked  &lt;list&gt;  data  that  can be added anywhere in the list, and also accessed anywhere as well.
       Access to a list is sequential, meaning you can position to the first, last, next  or  previous  element.
       Note that a list is accessible to the current process only.

       Generally information is stored in a linked list, and retrieved (possibly many times) in any order later.

       A  list has a current position where an element can be read, updated, inserted or deleted (via <b>read-list</b>,
       <b>write-list</b> and <b>delete-list</b>), and this position can be explicitly changed with <b>position-list</b>.

       <b>SCOPE</b>

       A linked list is accessible to the current process only, unless "process-scope" clause is used, in  which
       case  all  requests  served  by the process can use it (see <b>do-once</b> for a typical way to create an object
       with a process scope). If "process-scope" is used, then elements  of  the  list  will  keep  their  value
       between requests in the same process.

       See <b>write-list</b> for an example of a process-scoped list.
