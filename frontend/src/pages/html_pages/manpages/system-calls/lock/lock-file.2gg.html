</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lock-file -  (files)

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       Locks file exclusively.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
           lock-file &lt;file path&gt; id &lt;lock id&gt; [ status &lt;status&gt; ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       lock-file  attempts  to  create  file  with  the  full  path of &lt;file path&gt; (deleting it if existed), and
       exclusively lock it. If successful, no other process can do the same unless current process ends or calls
       <b>unlock-file</b>. This statement is non-blocking, thus you can check in a sleepy loop for success (see  <b>pause-</b>
       <b>program</b>).

       &lt;file  path&gt;  should  be  either an existing or non-existing file with a valid file path. If existing, it
       will be deleted.

       &lt;lock id&gt; (in "id" clause) is a file descriptor associated with locked file.

       &lt;status&gt; (in "status" clause) represents the status of file  locking:  GG_OKAY  if  successfully  locked,
       GG_ERR_FAILED if cannot lock (likely because another process holds a lock), GG_ERR_INVALID if the path of
       the file is invalid (i.e. if it is empty), GG_ERR_CREATE if lock file cannot be created.

       Generally,  this statement is used for process control. A process would use lock-file to start working on
       a job that only one process can do at a time; once done, by using <b>unlock-file</b> statement, another  process
       will  be  able to issue a successful lock-file call. Typically, lock-file is issued in a sleepy loop (see
       <b>pause-program</b>), waiting for a resource to be released.

       Note that file lock is not carried across children processes (i.e. if your process creates children, such
       as with <b>exec-program</b>, then such children must obtain their own lock). In addition, if a process serving a
       request terminates before the request could issue <b>unlock-file</b>, the lock will be automatically released.

       You can use any file name (likely choose a name that signifies the purpose of a lock, as long as you have
       permissions to create it), and create any number of them.  This  way  you  can  create  as  many  "binary
       semaphore"-like objects as you like.

           %% /locktest public
               // Get application home directory
               get-app directory to dir

               write-string fname
               @&lt;&lt;print-out dir&gt;&gt;/.lock
               end-write-string
               // Enter loop in which something is done, OR, program waits for others to complete their work before doing its own
               set-number lockid
               start-loop
                   // Attempt to lock file
                   lock-file fname id lockid status lockst
                   // Check the status of locking
                   if-true lockst equal GG_OKAY
                       // File successfully locked, simulate working for 20 seconds
                       @WORKING
                       pause-program 20000

                       // Exit while loop
                       break-loop
                   else-if lockst equal GG_ERR_FAILED
                       // Another process holds the lock, wait, try again for 1 second
                       pause-program 1000
                       @WAITING
                       continue-loop
                   else-if lockst equal GG_ERR_OPEN or lockst equal GG_ERR_INVALID
                       // Errors
                       @BAD LOCK
