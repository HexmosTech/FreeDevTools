</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fsync, fdatasync - synchronize a file's in-core state with storage device

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C library (<u>libc</u>, <u>-lc</u>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>fsync(int</b> <u>fd</u><b>);</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>fdatasync(int</b> <u>fd</u><b>);</b>

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see <b><a href="../man7/feature_test_macros.7.html">feature_test_macros</a></b>(7)):

       <b>fsync</b>():
           glibc 2.16 and later:
               No feature test macros need be defined
           glibc up to and including 2.15:
               _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE
                   || /* Since glibc 2.8: */ _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L

       <b>fdatasync</b>():
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 199309L || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fsync</b>()  transfers  ("flushes")  all modified in-core data of (i.e., modified buffer cache pages for) the
       file referred to by the file descriptor <u>fd</u> to the disk device (or other permanent storage device) so that
       all changed information can be retrieved even if the  system  crashes  or  is  rebooted.   This  includes
       writing  through  or flushing a disk cache if present.  The call blocks until the device reports that the
       transfer has completed.

       As well as flushing the file data, <b>fsync</b>() also flushes the metadata information associated with the file
       (see <b><a href="../man7/inode.7.html">inode</a></b>(7)).

       Calling <b>fsync</b>() does not necessarily ensure that the entry in the directory containing the file has  also
       reached disk.  For that an explicit <b>fsync</b>() on a file descriptor for the directory is also needed.

       <b>fdatasync</b>() is similar to <b>fsync</b>(), but does not flush modified metadata unless that metadata is needed in
       order  to allow a subsequent data retrieval to be correctly handled.  For example, changes to <u>st_atime</u> or
       <u>st_mtime</u> (respectively, time of last access and time of last modification; see <b><a href="../man7/inode.7.html">inode</a></b>(7)) do  not  require
       flushing because they are not necessary for a subsequent data read to be handled correctly.  On the other
       hand, a change to the file size (<u>st_size</u>, as made by say <b><a href="../man2/ftruncate.2.html">ftruncate</a></b>(2)), would require a metadata flush.

       The aim of <b>fdatasync</b>() is to reduce disk activity for applications that do not require all metadata to be
       synchronized with the disk.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       On  success,  these system calls return zero.  On error, -1 is returned, and <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the
       error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>EBADF</b>  <u>fd</u> is not a valid open file descriptor.

       <b>EINTR</b>  The function was interrupted by a signal; see <b><a href="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</a></b>(7).

       <b>EIO</b>    An error occurred during synchronization.  This error may relate to data  written  to  some  other
              file  descriptor  on  the same file.  Since Linux 4.13, errors from write-back will be reported to
              all file descriptors that might have written the data which triggered the error.  Some filesystems
              (e.g., NFS) keep close track of which data came through  which  file  descriptor,  and  give  more
              precise  reporting.   Other  filesystems  (e.g., most local filesystems) will report errors to all
              file descriptors that were open on the file when the error was recorded.

       <b>ENOSPC</b> Disk space was exhausted while synchronizing.

       <b>EROFS</b>
       <b>EINVAL</b> <u>fd</u> is bound  to  a  special  file  (e.g.,  a  pipe,  FIFO,  or  socket)  which  does  not  support
              synchronization.

       <b>ENOSPC</b>
       <b>EDQUOT</b> <u>fd</u>  is bound to a file on NFS or another filesystem which does not allocate space at the time of a
              <b><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></b>(2) system call, and some previous write failed due to insufficient storage space.

</pre><h4><b>VERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       On POSIX systems on which <b>fdatasync</b>() is available, <b>_POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO</b> is defined in <u>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</u> to  a
       value greater than 0.  (See also <b><a href="../man3/sysconf.3.html">sysconf</a></b>(3).)

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.1-2008.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.1-2001, 4.2BSD.

       In Linux 2.2 and earlier, <b>fdatasync</b>() is equivalent to <b>fsync</b>(), and so has no performance advantage.

       The  <b>fsync</b>()  implementations  in older kernels and lesser used filesystems do not know how to flush disk
       caches.  In these cases disk caches need to be disabled using <b><a href="../man8/hdparm.8.html">hdparm</a></b>(8) or <b><a href="../man8/sdparm.8.html">sdparm</a></b>(8)  to  guarantee  safe
       operation.

       Under  AT&amp;T  UNIX  System  V Release 4 <u>fd</u> needs to be opened for writing.  This is by itself incompatible
       with the original BSD interface and forbidden by POSIX, but nevertheless survives in HP-UX and AIX.
