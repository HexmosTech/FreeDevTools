</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       issetugid — is current process tainted by uid or gid changes

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;</b>

       <u>int</u>
       <b>issetugid</b>(<u>void</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>issetugid</b>()  system  call returns 1 if the process environment or memory address space is considered
       “tainted”, and returns 0 otherwise.

       A process is tainted if it was created as a result of an <u><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></u>(2) system call which had  either  of  the
       setuid  or  setgid bits set (and extra privileges were given as a result) or if it has changed any of its
       real, effective or saved user or group ID's since it began execution.

       This system call exists so that library routines (eg: libc, libtermcap) can reliably determine if  it  is
       safe  to use information that was obtained from the user, in particular the results from <u><a href="../man3/getenv.3.html">getenv</a></u>(3) should
       be viewed with suspicion if it is used to control operation.

       A “tainted” status is inherited by child processes as a result of  the  <u><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></u>(2)  system  call  (or  other
       library code that calls fork, such as <u><a href="../man3/popen.3.html">popen</a></u>(3)).

       It is assumed that a program that clears all privileges as it prepares to execute another will also reset
       the  environment,  hence the “tainted” status will not be passed on.  This is important for programs such
       as <u><a href="../man1/su.1.html">su</a></u>(1) which begin setuid but need to be able to create an untainted process.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>issetugid</b>() system call is always successful, and no return value is reserved to indicate an error.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>issetugid</b>() system call first appeared in OpenBSD 2.0 and was also implemented in FreeBSD 3.0.
