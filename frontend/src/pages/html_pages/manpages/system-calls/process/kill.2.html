</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       kill - send signal to a process

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C library (<u>libc</u>, <u>-lc</u>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/signal.h">signal.h</a>&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>kill(pid_t</b> <u>pid</u><b>,</b> <b>int</b> <u>sig</u><b>);</b>

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see <b><a href="../man7/feature_test_macros.7.html">feature_test_macros</a></b>(7)):

       <b>kill</b>():
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>kill</b>() system call can be used to send any signal to any process group or process.

       If <u>pid</u> is positive, then signal <u>sig</u> is sent to the process with the ID specified by <u>pid</u>.

       If <u>pid</u> equals 0, then <u>sig</u> is sent to every process in the process group of the calling process.

       If  <u>pid</u> equals -1, then <u>sig</u> is sent to every process for which the calling process has permission to send
       signals, except for process 1 (<u>init</u>), but see below.

       If <u>pid</u> is less than -1, then <u>sig</u> is sent to every process in the process group whose ID is <u>-pid</u>.

       If <u>sig</u> is 0, then no signal is sent, but existence and permission checks are still performed; this can be
       used to check for the existence of a process ID or process group ID  that  the  caller  is  permitted  to
       signal.

       For  a  process  to have permission to send a signal, it must either be privileged (under Linux: have the
       <b>CAP_KILL</b> capability in the user namespace of the target process), or the real or effective user ID of the
       sending process must equal the real or saved set-user-ID of the target process.  In the case of  <b>SIGCONT</b>,
       it  suffices  when  the  sending  and receiving processes belong to the same session.  (Historically, the
       rules were different; see NOTES.)

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       On success (at least one signal was sent), zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and <u>errno</u> is  set
       to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>EINVAL</b> An invalid signal was specified.

       <b>EPERM</b>  The calling process does not have permission to send the signal to any of the target processes.

       <b>ESRCH</b>  The  target  process  or  process  group does not exist.  Note that an existing process might be a
              zombie, a process that has terminated execution, but has not yet been <b><a href="../man2/wait.2.html">wait</a></b>(2)ed for.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.1-2008.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.1-2001, SVr4, 4.3BSD.

   <b>Linux</b> <b>notes</b>
       Across different kernel versions, Linux has enforced different rules for the permissions required for  an
       unprivileged  process to send a signal to another process.  In Linux 1.0 to 1.2.2, a signal could be sent
       if the effective user ID of the sender matched effective user ID of the target, or the real  user  ID  of
       the sender matched the real user ID of the target.  From Linux 1.2.3 until 1.3.77, a signal could be sent
       if  the  effective user ID of the sender matched either the real or effective user ID of the target.  The
       current rules, which conform to POSIX.1, were adopted in Linux 1.3.78.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The only signals that can be sent to process ID 1, the  <u>init</u>  process,  are  those  for  which  <u>init</u>  has
       explicitly  installed  signal  handlers.   This  is  done  to  assure  the  system  is  not  brought down
       accidentally.

       POSIX.1 requires that <u>kill(-1,sig)</u> send <u>sig</u> to all processes that the calling process  may  send  signals
       to,  except  possibly for some implementation-defined system processes.  Linux allows a process to signal
       itself, but on Linux the call <u>kill(-1,sig)</u> does not signal the calling process.

       POSIX.1 requires that if a process sends a signal to itself, and the sending thread  does  not  have  the
       signal  blocked,  and  no  other thread has it unblocked or is waiting for it in <b><a href="../man3/sigwait.3.html">sigwait</a></b>(3), at least one
       unblocked signal must be delivered to the sending thread before the <b>kill</b>() returns.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       In Linux 2.6 up to and including Linux 2.6.7, there was a bug that meant that when sending signals  to  a
       process  group,  <b>kill</b>()  failed  with  the  error <b>EPERM</b> if the caller did not have permission to send the
       signal to <u>any</u> (rather than <u>all</u>) of the members of the process group.  Notwithstanding this error  return,
       the signal was still delivered to all of the processes for which the caller had permission to signal.
