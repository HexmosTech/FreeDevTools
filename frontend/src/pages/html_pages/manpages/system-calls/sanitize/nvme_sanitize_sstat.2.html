</pre><h4><b>Constants</b></h4><pre>
       NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_STATUS_SHIFT
                   Shift  amount  to  get the status value of the most recent sanitize operation from the <u>struct</u>
                   <u>nvme_sanitize_log_page</u>.sstat field.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_STATUS_MASK
                   Mask to get the status value of the most recent sanitize operation.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_STATUS_NEVER_SANITIZED
                   The NVM subsystem has never been sanitized.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_STATUS_COMPLETE_SUCCESS
                   The most recent sanitize operation completed  successfully  including  any  additional  media
                   modification.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_STATUS_IN_PROGESS
                   A sanitize operation is currently in progress.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_STATUS_COMPLETED_FAILED
                   The most recent sanitize operation failed.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_STATUS_ND_COMPLETE_SUCCESS
                   The  most  recent sanitize operation for which No-Deallocate After Sanitize was requested has
                   completed successfully with deallocation of all user data.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_COMPLETED_PASSES_SHIFT
                   Shift amount to get the number of completed passes if the most recent sanitize operation  was
                   an Overwrite. This value shall be cleared to 0h if the most recent sanitize operation was not
                   an Overwrite.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_COMPLETED_PASSES_MASK
                   Mask to get the number of completed passes.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_GLOBAL_DATA_ERASED_SHIFT
                   Shift amount to get the Global Data Erased value from the <u>struct</u> <u>nvme_sanitize_log_page</u>.sstat
                   field.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_GLOBAL_DATA_ERASED_MASK
                   Mask to get the Global Data Erased value.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_GLOBAL_DATA_ERASED
                   Global Data Erased: if set, then no namespace user data in the NVM subsystem has been written
                   to  and  no  Persistent  Memory  Region  in  the  NVM  subsystem has been enabled since being
                   manufactured and the NVM subsystem has  never  been  sanitized;  or  since  the  most  recent
                   successful sanitize operation.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_MVCNCLD_SHIFT
                   Shift amount to get the value of Media Verification Canceled bit of Sanitize status field.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_MVCNCLD_MASK
                   Mask to get the value of Media Verification Canceled bit of Sanitize status field.
