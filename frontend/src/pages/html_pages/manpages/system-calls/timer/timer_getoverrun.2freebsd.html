       timer_getoverrun, timer_gettime, timer_settime — per-process timers (REALTIME)

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX Real-time Library (librt, -lrt)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/time.h">time.h</a>&gt;</b>

       <u>int</u>
       <b>timer_getoverrun</b>(<u>timer_t</u> <u>timerid</u>);

       <u>int</u>
       <b>timer_gettime</b>(<u>timer_t</u> <u>timerid</u>, <u>struct</u> <u>itimerspec</u> <u>*value</u>);

       <u>int</u>
       <b>timer_settime</b>(<u>timer_t</u> <u>timerid</u>,             <u>int</u> <u>flags</u>,            <u>const</u> <u>struct</u> <u>itimerspec</u> <u>*restrict</u> <u>value</u>,
           <u>struct</u> <u>itimerspec</u> <u>*restrict</u> <u>ovalue</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>timer_gettime</b>() system call stores the amount of time until the specified timer, <u>timerid</u>, expires and
       the reload value of the timer into the space pointed to by the <u>value</u> argument.  The  <u>it_value</u>  member  of
       this  structure  contains  the amount of time before the timer expires, or zero if the timer is disarmed.
       This value is returned as the interval until timer expiration, even if the timer was armed with  absolute
       time.  The <u>it_interval</u> member of <u>value</u> contains the reload value last set by <b>timer_settime</b>().

       The <b>timer_settime</b>() system call sets the time until the next expiration of the timer specified by <u>timerid</u>
       from the <u>it_value</u> member of the <u>value</u> argument and arms the timer if the <u>it_value</u> member of <u>value</u> is non-
       zero.  If the specified timer was already armed when <b>timer_settime</b>() is called, this call resets the time
       until  next  expiration  to  the  value specified.  If the <u>it_value</u> member of <u>value</u> is zero, the timer is
       disarmed.  If the timer is disarmed, then pending signal is removed.

       If the flag TIMER_ABSTIME is not set in the argument <u>flags</u>, <b>timer_settime</b>() behaves as if the time  until
       next  expiration  is set to be equal to the interval specified by the <u>it_value</u> member of <u>value</u>.  That is,
       the timer expires in <u>it_value</u> nanoseconds from when the call is made.  If the flag TIMER_ABSTIME  is  set
       in the argument <u>flags</u>, <b>timer_settime</b>() behaves as if the time until next expiration is set to be equal to
       the  difference between the absolute time specified by the it_value member of value and the current value
       of the clock associated with <u>timerid</u>.  That is, the timer  expires  when  the  clock  reaches  the  value
       specified  by  the  <u>it_value</u>  member of <u>value</u>.  If the specified time has already passed, the system call
       succeeds and the expiration notification is made.

       The reload value of the timer is set to the value specified by the <u>it_interval</u> member of <u>value</u>.   When  a
       timer is armed with a non-zero <u>it_interval</u>, a periodic (or repetitive) timer is specified.

       Time  values  that  are  between  two consecutive non-negative integer multiples of the resolution of the
       specified timer are rounded up to the larger multiple of the resolution.   Quantization  error  will  not
       cause the timer to expire earlier than the rounded time value.

       If the argument <u>ovalue</u> is not NULL, the <b>timer_settime</b>() system call stores, in the location referenced by
       <u>ovalue</u>,  a value representing the previous amount of time before the timer would have expired, or zero if
       the timer was disarmed, together with the previous timer reload value.  Timers do not expire before their
       scheduled time.

       Only a single signal is queued to the process for a given timer at any point in time.  When a  timer  for
       which  a  signal  is  still pending expires, no signal is queued, and a timer overrun will occur.  When a
       timer expiration signal is accepted by a process, the <b>timer_getoverrun</b>() system call  returns  the  timer
       expiration  overrun  count  for  the  specified timer.  The overrun count returned contains the number of
       extra timer expirations that occurred between the time the signal was generated (queued) and when it  was
       accepted,  up  to  but  not  including  an  maximum  of  {DELAYTIMER_MAX}.   If  the number of such extra
       expirations  is  greater  than  or  equal  to  {DELAYTIMER_MAX},  then  the  overrun  count  is  set   to
       {DELAYTIMER_MAX}.   The value returned by <b>timer_getoverrun</b>() applies to the most recent expiration signal
       acceptance for the timer.  If no expiration signal has been delivered for the timer, the return value  of
       <b>timer_getoverrun</b>() is unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  <b>timer_getoverrun</b>()  system  call  succeeds,  it  returns  the  timer expiration overrun count as
       explained above.  Otherwise the value -1 is returned, and the global variable <u>errno</u> is  set  to  indicate
       the error.

       The  <b>timer_gettime</b>()  and  <b>timer_settime</b>()  functions  return  the  value  0 if successful; otherwise the
       value -1 is returned and the global variable <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>timer_settime</b>() system call will fail if:

       [EINVAL]           A <u>value</u> structure specified a nanosecond value less than zero or greater than or equal
                          to 1000 million, and the <u>it_value</u> member  of  that  structure  did  not  specify  zero
                          seconds and nanoseconds.

       These system calls may fail if:

       [EINVAL]           The  <u>timerid</u>  argument does not correspond to an ID returned by <b>timer_create</b>() but not
                          yet deleted by <b>timer_delete</b>().

       The <b>timer_settime</b>() system call may fail if:

       [EINVAL]           The <u>it_interval</u>  member  of  <u>value</u>  is  not  zero  and  the  timer  was  created  with
                          notification  by  creation of a new thread (<u>sigev_sigev_notify</u> was SIGEV_THREAD) and a
                          fixed  stack  address  has  been  set  in  the  thread   attribute   pointed   to   by
                          <u>sigev_notify_attributes</u>.

       The <b>timer_gettime</b>() and <b>timer_settime</b>() system calls may fail if:

       [EFAULT]           Any  arguments  point  outside  the  allocated  address  space  or  there  is a memory
                          protection fault.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>timer_getoverrun</b>(), <b>timer_gettime</b>(), and <b>timer_settime</b>() system calls conform to IEEE Std 1003.1-2004
       (“POSIX.1”).

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Support for POSIX per-process timer first appeared in FreeBSD 7.0.
