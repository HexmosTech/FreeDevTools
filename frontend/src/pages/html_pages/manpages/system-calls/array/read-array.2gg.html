</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       read-array -  (array)

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       Get data from an array.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
           read-array &lt;array&gt; \
               key &lt;key&gt; \
               value &lt;value&gt; \
               [ delete [ &lt;delete&gt; ] ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       read-array  will obtain an element from &lt;array&gt; (that was created with <b>new-array</b>); an element obtained is
       &lt;value&gt; (in "value" clause) based on a number &lt;key&gt; (in "key" clause). &lt;key&gt; is a number  from  0  up  to
       (excluding) the currently allocated array size. The type of &lt;value&gt; is determined when &lt;array&gt; is created
       (see "type" clause), and can be either a string, number or a boolean.

       You  can  also  delete an element from the array by using "delete" clause - the &lt;value&gt; is still obtained
       though it is no longer in the array. The array element is deleted if  "delete"  clause  is  used  without
       boolean  variable &lt;delete&gt;, or if &lt;delete&gt; evaluates to true. "Deleting" means that if string store would
       be set to an empty string, a number would be set to 0, and a boolean would be set to false.

       Note that array may be allocated beyond the highest index of an element written to it; reading from  such
       elements  that  have  never  been  written to will produce an empty string, a number 0 or a boolean false
       value (depending on the type of array).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       In this example, a new array is created, a value is written to it, and then the value is obtained and the
       element deleted; return status is checked:

           // Create new array
           new-array arr type string

           // Write to array
           write-array arr key 500 value "some data"

           // Read from array
           read-array arr key 500 value res status st delete
           @Deleted value is &lt;&lt;print-out res&gt;&gt;
