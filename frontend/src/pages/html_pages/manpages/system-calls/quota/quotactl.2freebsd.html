</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       quotactl — manipulate file system quotas

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</b>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;ufs/ufs/quota.h&gt;</b>

       <u>int</u>
       <b>quotactl</b>(<u>const</u> <u>char</u> <u>*path</u>, <u>int</u> <u>cmd</u>, <u>int</u> <u>id</u>, <u>void</u> <u>*addr</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>quotactl</b>() system call enables, disables and manipulates file system quotas.  A quota control command
       given  by  <u>cmd</u> operates on the given filename <u>path</u> for the given user or group <u>id</u>.  (NOTE: One should use
       the QCMD macro defined in &lt;<u>ufs/ufs/quota.h</u>&gt; to formulate the value for <u>cmd</u>.)  The address of an  optional
       command  specific  data  structure,  <u>addr</u>,  may be given; its interpretation is discussed below with each
       command.

       For commands that use the <u>id</u> identifier, it must be either -1 or any positive value.   The  value  of  -1
       indicates that the current UID or GID should be used.  Any other negative value will return an error.

       Currently  quotas  are  supported  only for the “ufs” file system.  For “ufs”, a command is composed of a
       primary command (see below) and a command type used  to  interpret  the  <u>id</u>.   Types  are  supported  for
       interpretation  of  user  identifiers  (USRQUOTA)  and  group identifiers (GRPQUOTA).  The “ufs” specific
       commands are:

       Q_QUOTAON        Enable disk quotas for the file system specified by <u>path</u>.  The  command  type  specifies
                        the  type of the quotas being enabled.  The <u>addr</u> argument specifies a file from which to
                        take the  quotas.   The  quota  file  must  exist;  it  is  normally  created  with  the
                        <u><a href="../man8/quotacheck.8.html">quotacheck</a></u>(8)  program.  The <u>id</u> argument is unused.  Only the super-user may turn quotas
                        on.

       Q_QUOTAOFF       Disable disk quotas for the file system specified by <u>path</u>.  The command  type  specifies
                        the  type of the quotas being disabled.  The <u>addr</u> and <u>id</u> arguments are unused.  Only the
                        super-user may turn quotas off.

       Q_GETQUOTASIZE   Get the wordsize used to represent the quotas for the user or group  (as  determined  by
                        the  command  type).  Possible values are 32 for the old-style quota file and 64 for the
                        new-style quota file.  The <u>addr</u> argument is a pointer to an integer into which the  size
                        is stored.  The identifier <u>id</u> is not used.

       Q_GETQUOTA       Get  disk  quota  limits  and  current usage for the user or group (as determined by the
                        command type) with identifier <u>id</u>.  The <u>addr</u> argument is a  pointer  to  a  <u>struct</u>  <u>dqblk</u>
                        structure (defined in &lt;<u>ufs/ufs/quota.h</u>&gt;).

       Q_SETQUOTA       Set  disk  quota  limits  for the user or group (as determined by the command type) with
                        identifier <u>id</u>.  The <u>addr</u> argument is a pointer to a <u>struct</u> <u>dqblk</u> structure  (defined  in
                        &lt;<u>ufs/ufs/quota.h</u>&gt;).   The  usage fields of the <u>dqblk</u> structure are ignored.  This system
                        call is restricted to the super-user.

       Q_SETUSE         Set disk usage limits for the user or group (as determined by  the  command  type)  with
                        identifier  <u>id</u>.   The <u>addr</u> argument is a pointer to a <u>struct</u> <u>dqblk</u> structure (defined in
                        &lt;<u>ufs/ufs/quota.h</u>&gt;).  Only the usage fields are used.  This system call is restricted  to
                        the super-user.

       Q_SYNC           Update  the  on-disk  copy  of  quota  usages.  The command type specifies which type of
                        quotas are to be updated.  The <u>id</u> and <u>addr</u> arguments are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>quotactl</b>() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1  is  returned  and  the
       global variable <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>quotactl</b>() system call will fail if:

       [EOPNOTSUPP]       The kernel has not been compiled with the QUOTA option.

       [EUSERS]           The quota table cannot be expanded.

       [EINVAL]           The  <u>cmd</u>  argument  or  the  command  type is invalid.  In Q_GETQUOTASIZE, Q_GETQUOTA,
                          Q_SETQUOTA, and Q_SETUSE, quotas are not currently enabled for this file system.

                          The <u>id</u> argument to Q_GETQUOTA, Q_SETQUOTA or Q_SETUSE is a negative value.

       [EACCES]           In Q_QUOTAON, the quota file is not a plain file.

       [EACCES]           Search permission is denied for a component of a path prefix.

       [ENOTDIR]          A component of a path prefix was not a directory.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]     A component of either pathname exceeded 255 characters, or the entire length of either
                          path name exceeded 1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]           A filename does not exist.

       [ELOOP]            Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating a pathname.

       [EROFS]            In Q_QUOTAON, either the file system on which quotas are  to  be  enabled  is  mounted
                          read-only or the quota file resides on a read-only file system.

       [EIO]              An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to a file containing quotas.

       [EINTEGRITY]       Corrupted data was detected while reading from the file system.

       [EFAULT]           An  invalid  <u>addr</u> was supplied; the associated structure could not be copied in or out
                          of the kernel.

       [EFAULT]           The <u>path</u> argument points outside the process's allocated address space.

       [EPERM]            The call was privileged and the caller was not the super-user.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>quotactl</b>() system call appeared in 4.3BSD-Reno.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There should be some  way  to  integrate  this  call  with  the  resource  limit  interface  provided  by
       <u><a href="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</a></u>(2) and <u><a href="../man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit</a></u>(2).
