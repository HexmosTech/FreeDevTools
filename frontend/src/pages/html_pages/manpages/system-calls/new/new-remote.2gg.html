               [ timeout &lt;timeout&gt; ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       new-remote  will  create  resources  needed  for  a  service  call (see <b>call-remote</b>); these resources are
       contained in variable &lt;service&gt;.

       <b>LOCAL</b> <b>OR</b> <b>LOCATION</b>

       If "local" clause is used, then service is a Golf application running on the same computer, and the  name
       of this application is string &lt;app name&gt;.

       If  "local"  is  not  used,  then  you must use "location" clause. &lt;location&gt; (in "location" clause) is a
       string representing either a Unix socket or a TCP socket of a remote service, and is:

           • for a Unix socket, a fully qualified name to a Unix  socket  file  used  to  communicate  with  the
           service  (for  a  Golf  server,  it's  "/var/lib/gg/&lt;app  name&gt;/sock/sock",  where  &lt;app name&gt; is the
           application name), or

           • for a TCP socket, a host name and a port  number  in  the  form  of  "&lt;host  name&gt;:&lt;port  number&gt;",
           specifying  where  the service is listening on (for instance "127.0.0.1:2301" if the service is local
           and runs on TCP port 2301).

       <b>URL-PATH</b> <b>OR</b> <b>ITS</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b>

       If "url-path" is used, then it's a <b>URL</b> <b>path</b> to a service.

       If "url-path" is not used, then you must use "app-path" and "request-path" clauses  with  optional  "url-
       params"  clause.  &lt;app  path&gt;  string (in "app-path" clause) is the application path used to access a URL
       resource in service &lt;location&gt;, &lt;request path&gt; string (in "request-path" clause) is the <b>request</b> path used
       to access a URL resource in service &lt;location&gt;, while &lt;url params&gt; string (in "url-params" clause) is the
       URL parameters, see <b>request</b>.

       <b>OPTIONAL</b>

       &lt;request method&gt; string (in "method" clause) is a request method, such as "GET", "POST", "DELETE",  "PUT"
       etc. The default is "GET".

       Request  body  (i.e.  body  content)  is  specified  via  "request-body" clause. Within it, &lt;content&gt; (in
       "content" subclause) is the actual body content string. &lt;content length&gt;  (in "content-length" subclause)
       specifies the number of bytes in &lt;content&gt;; by default it will be the string  length  of  &lt;content&gt;  (see
       <b>string-length</b>).  Mandatory  &lt;content  type&gt;  (in  "content-type" subclause) is the body content type (for
       instance  "application/json" or "image/jpg").

       &lt;url params&gt; string (in "url-params" clause) is the URL parameters, see <b>request</b>.

       &lt;environment&gt; (in "environment" clause) is the environment passed to a  service  call,  in  the  form  of
       "name"="value"  string  list  where  such environment elements are separated by a comma. This way you can
       send any environment variables to the request executed remotely. For a Golf server, you can access  those
       variables  in  a  remote request by using "environment" clause of <b>get-sys</b> statement. There is no limit on
       the number of environment variables you can  use  this  way,  other  than  the  underlying  communication
       library.

       &lt;timeout&gt; (in "timeout" clause) is the number of seconds after which a service call will timeout; meaning
       the  duration  of  a  service call should not exceed this period of time. For no timeout, specify 0. Note
       that time needed for a DNS resolution of &lt;location&gt; is not counted in &lt;timeout&gt;. Maximum value  is  86400
       seconds.  Even  though  it's  optional,  it  is recommended to specify &lt;timeout&gt; in order to avoid a Golf
       process waiting for a very long time. Note that even if your service call times out, the  actual  request
       executing on the server may continue until it's done.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       In  this  example,  3  service  calls  are created ("srv1", "srv2" and "srv3"), and they will each make a
       service request.

       Each service request will add a key ("key1" with data "data_1", "key2" with data "data_2" and "key3" with
       data "data_3").

       All three service calls connect via Unix socket.

       A  full  URL  path  of  a  service  request  (for   "srv1"   for   example),   would   be   "/app/manage-
       keys/op=add/key=key_1/data=data_1"  (note  that  "app"  is  the application name and "manage-keys" is the
       request handler that provides the service).

       Copy this to "manage_keys.golf" source file:

           %% /manage-keys public
              do-once
              new-hash h hash-size 1024 process-scope
              end-do-once

              // Get input parameters
              get-param op
              get-param key
              get-param data

              if-true op equal "add" // Add data to hash,
                  write-hash h key (key) value data status st
                  @Added [&lt;&lt;print-out key&gt;&gt;]
              else-if op equal "delete" // Delete data and obtain the value deleted
                  read-hash h key (key) value val \
                      delete \
                      status st
                  if-true st equal GG_ERR_EXIST
                      @Not found [&lt;&lt;print-out key&gt;&gt;]
                  else-if
                      // If found, then delete key and value
                      @Deleted [&lt;&lt;print-out val&gt;&gt;]
                      delete-string val
                  end-if
              else-if op equal "query" // Query hash based on key value
                  read-hash h key (key) value val status st
                  if-true st equal GG_ERR_EXIST
                      @Not found, queried [&lt;&lt;print-out key&gt;&gt;]
                  else-if
                      @Value [&lt;&lt;print-out val&gt;&gt;]
                  end-if
              end-if
           %%

       Then <b>call-remote</b> will make three service calls to the above request handler in parallel (i.e. as  threads
       executing  at the same time). You can examine if everything went okay, how many threads have started, and
       how many finished with a reply from the service (this means  any  kind  of  reply,  even  if  an  error).
       Finally,  the  output  from  each call is displayed (that's "data" clause in <b>read-remote</b> statement at the
       end).

       Create file "srv.golf" and copy to it this code:

           begin-handler <a href="file:/srv">/srv</a> public
            // Create resources (prepare) for 3 service calls
            // We pass environment variable GG_SILENT_HEADER to these calls
            // so they don't emit HTTP header
            new-remote srv1 local "app" \
                url-path "/app/manage-keys/op=add/key=key1/data=data1" \
                environment "GG_SILENT_HEADER"="yes"
            new-remote srv2 local "app" \
                url-path "/app/manage-keys/op=add/key=key2/data=data2" \
                environment "GG_SILENT_HEADER"="yes"
            new-remote srv3 local "app" \
                url-path "/app/manage-keys/op=add/key=key3/data=data3" \
                environment "GG_SILENT_HEADER"="yes"
            // Make 3 service calls in parallel, each in it own thread
            call-remote srv1, srv2, srv3 status st \
                started start \
                finished-okay fok
            // Check if all calls were completed
            if-true st equal GG_OKAY
                @No errors from call-remote
            end-if
            if-true start equal 3
                @All three service calls started.
            end-if
            if-true fok equal 3
                @All three service calls finished.
            end-if
            read-remote srv1 data rdata1
            read-remote srv2 data rdata2
            read-remote srv3 data rdata3
            print-out rdata1
            @
            print-out rdata2
            @
            print-out rdata3
            @
           end-handler

       Create the application:

           sudo mgrg -i -u $(whoami) app

       Make it:

           gg -q

       Run it:

           mgrg -w 1 app

           gg -r --req="<a href="file:/srv">/srv</a>" --exec --silent-header

       And the result is (assuming you have started hash example above):

           No errors from call-remote
           All three service calls started.
           All three service calls finished.
