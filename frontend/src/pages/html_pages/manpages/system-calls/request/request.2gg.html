       request - Golf documentation (requests)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Golf  applications  run by processing requests. A request always takes form of an HTTP request, meaning a
       URL, an optional HTTP request body, and any environment variables. This is regardless of whether  it's  a
       <b>service</b> or a <b>command-line</b> program.

       <b>REQUEST</b> <b>URL</b>

       A  "request  URL" is a URL that an outside caller (such as a web browser) uses to execute your Golf code.
       Aside from the scheme, domain and port, it's made up of:

           • application path,

           • request path, and

           • URL parameters.

       Here's a breakdown of URL structure:

           &lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;domain&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;]&lt;application path&gt;&lt;request path&gt;&lt;parameters&gt;

       For example, in the following URL:

           https://your.website.com/my-app/my-request/par1=val1/par2=val2

       "/my-app" is application path, "/my-request" is request path and  "/par1=val1/par2=val2"  are  parameters
       "par1"  and  "par2" with values "val1" and "val2". Together, application path and request path are called
       URL path.

       <b>APPLICATION</b> <b>PATH</b>

       The leading part of URL's path is  called  "application  path".  By  default,  application  path  is  the
       application  name  (see  <b>mgrg</b> with "-i" option) preceded by forward slash ("/"); if it's "shopping", then
       the default application path is:

           /shopping

       Application name can contain alphanumerical characters and hyphens.

       <b>-</b> <b>Customizing</b> <b>application</b> <b>path</b>

       You can change the application path by specifying it with "--path" parameter in <b>gg</b>  when  building;  each
       application must have its own unique path. Note that whatever it may be, the application name must always
       be  its last path segment. For example, if your application name is "shopping", then the application path
       may be:

           /api/v2/shopping

       An example of specifying the custom application path:

           gg -q --path="/api/v2/shopping"

       <b>REQUEST</b> <b>PATH</b>

       Request path follows the application path, for instance:

           https://some.web.site/shopping/buy-item

       In this case the application path is "/shopping" and the request path is "/buy-item". It means that  file
       "buy-item.golf" handles request "/buy-item" by implementing a <b>begin-handler</b> "/buy-item" in it. As another
       example,  file  "services/manage-home.golf"  (meaning "manage-home.golf" file in subdirectory "services")
       handles request "/services/manage-home" etc.

       The request path must match (fully or partially) the path of the  file  name  that  implements  it,  with
       source  directory  being the root ("/"). Here is an example of implementing a request "/buy-item" in file
       "buy-item.golf":

           begin-handler /buy-item public
               get-param some_param
               @Bought item: &lt;&lt;print-out some_param&gt;&gt;
           end-handler

       As an example of a path hierarchy, such as for example a hierarchy  of  resources,  methods  etc,  <b>begin-</b>
       <b>handler</b> may be:

           begin-handler /items/wine-collection/red-wine/buy-item public
               ...
           end-handler

       then the URL to call it would be:

           https://some.web.site/shopping/items/wine-collection/red-wine/buy-item

       and   might   be   implemented  in  file  "items/wine-collection/red-wine/buy-item.golf",  meaning  under
       subdirectory "items", then subdirectory "wine-collection", then subdirectory "red-wine", then file  "buy-
       item.golf".

       <b>-</b> <b>File/path</b> <b>naming</b> <b>conventions</b>

       By  default, a request handler would be implemented in a source file whose path matches the request path,
       either fully or partially.

       The simplest example is that "/buy-item" request must be implemented in file "buy-item.golf".

       As a more  involved  example,  request  handler  for  "/items/wine-collection/red-wine/buy-item"  can  be
       implemented in file "items.golf" or file "items/wine-collection.golf" or file "items/wine-collection/red-
       wine.golf" or file "items/wine-collection/red-wine/buy-item.golf".

       Each  of  these source files can contain any number of matching requests. For instance, file "items.golf"
       can contain  request  handlers  for  both  "/items/wine-collection/red-wine/buy-item"  and  "/items/beer-
       collection/ipa-beer/buy-item";  while  file "items/wine-collection.golf" can contain request handlers for
       both "items/wine-collection/red-wine" and "items/wine-collection/white-wine".

       By the same token, file "items/wine-collection/red-wine/buy-item.golf" can implement  both  "/items/wine-
       collection/red-wine/buy-item"   and  "/items/wine-collection/red-wine/buy-item/sale"  requests,  as  both
       requests match the file path.

       Note that if you use "--single-file" option in <b>gg</b>, then each source ".golf"  file  must  contain  only  a
       single request, and its request path must match the file path fully. So in this case, request handler for
       "/items/wine-collection/red-wine/buy-item"   must   be   in   file   "items/wine-collection/red-wine/buy-
       item.golf", and no other request can be implemented in it.

       <b>URL</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>

       The actual input parameters follow after the request path, and can be specified in a number  of  ways.  A
       parameter value is generally URL encoded in any case.

       <b>-</b> <b>Path</b> <b>segments</b>

       A common way is to specify name and value separated by an equal sign within a single path segment:

           https://some.web.site/shopping/buy-item/sku=4811/price=600/

       This  way,  you have a readable representation of parameter names and values, while still maintaining the
       hierarchical form which conveys how are the parameters structured.

       Here, the required request path is "/buy-item" and there are two input  parameters  ("sku"  and  "price")
       with values of "4811" and "600" respectively.

       <b>-</b> <b>Query</b> <b>string</b>

       Parameters can be specified after a question mark in a "name=value" form. For example, the full URL (with
       the same parameter values as above) may be:

           https://some.web.site/shopping/buy-item?sku=4811&amp;price=600

       <b>-</b> <b>Mixed</b>

       You  can  specify  a mix of the above ways to write parameters, for instance the above URL can be written
       as:

           https://some.web.site/shopping/buy-item/sku=4811?price=600

       <b>-</b> <b>Parameters</b>

       A parameter name can be comprised of alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores, and it must  start
       with  an  alphabet  character.  Any  hyphens  are  converted  to underscores for the purpose of obtaining
       parameter value, see <b>get-param</b>. Do not use double underscore ("__") in parameter names.

       Structuring your parameters, i.e. the order in a query path or path segments, and which ones (if any) are
       in a query string, is determined by you. Regardless of your choices, the code that handles a  request  is
       the  same.  In  the example used here, you can obtain the parameters in request handler source file "buy-
       item.golf":

           begin-handler /buy-item public
               get-param sku
               get-param price

               run-query @mydb = "update wine_items set price='%s' where sku='%s'" : price, sku no-loop
               @OKAY
           end-handler

       For a hierarchical URL path, you would write the same:

           begin-handler /items/wine-collection/red-wine/buy-item public
               get-param sku
               get-param price

               run-query @mydb = "update wine_items set price='%s' where sku='%s'" : price, sku no-loop
           end-handler

       <b>MAXIMUM</b> <b>LENGTH</b>

       Maximum length of a request URL is 2500 bytes.

       <b>HOW</b> <b>GOLF</b> <b>HANDLES</b> <b>REQUESTS</b>

       There are generally two kinds of requests, depending on their origin. If a request comes from outside the
       process that's serving it, then it's an "external" request (such as from a web browser, a web API client,
       from command line execution etc). Conversely, if a request comes from inside the process  that's  serving
       it,  it's  an  "internal"  request  -  meaning  one  request  handler  is  calling another within one the
       process(es) serving an application. Internal requests are made using <b>call-handler</b> statement.

       An external request is handled by a first available process:

           • For a <b>command-line</b> program, there is only a single process, and it handles a single requests before
           it exits.

           • For a <b>service</b> application, there can be any number of processes running. A  process  is  chosen  to
           service  a  request  if  it  is currently not serving other requests; this way there are no processes
           waiting idle unnecessarily. Each process is identical and can serve any  request,  i.e.  it  has  all
           request  handlers  available  to  it.  Thus,  when  a process is chosen to serve a request, then this
           process will simply execute its begin-handler.

       <b>-</b> <b>Processing</b> <b>a</b> <b>request</b>

       To handle a request, a process first calls a Golf dispatcher, which is automatically generated. It uses a
       request name to call the appropriate request handler, as explained above.

       You can implement two hooks into request handling: one that executes before each request (<b>before-handler</b>)
       and one that executes afterwards (<b>after-handler</b>).

       At the end of the request, all request memory and all file handles  allocated  by  Golf  will  be  freed,
       except for process-scoped memory (see <b>memory-handling</b>).

       <b>-</b> <b>Performance</b>

       Golf  uses  a  hash  table  to  match  a  request  with  a handler function, as well to match parameters.
       Typically, it takes only a single lookup to find  the  handler  function/parameters,  regardless  of  the
       number  of  possible  request  names/parameters a process may serve (be it 10 or 10,000 different names).
       Golf pre-generates a hash table at compile time, so no run-time cycles are spent on  creating  it.  Also,
       the hash table is created as a continuous block of memory in the program's data segment, which loads as a
       part  of  the  program  (as  a  single  memory copy) and is very fast because accessing the data needs no
       pointer translations. As a result, Golf dispatcher is extremely fast.

       <b>-</b> <b>Unrecognized</b> <b>requests</b>

       If no request has been recognized (i.e. request name does not match any request-handling  ".golf"  source
       file), then

           • no request handler will execute,

           • <b>before-handler</b> and <b>after-handler</b> will not execute either,

           • and a "Request not found" error will be reported via <b>report-error</b>.
