       web-framework-for-C-programming-language - Golf documentation (C-language)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>GOLF</b> <b>AS</b> <b>A</b> <b>WEB</b> <b>FRAMEWORK</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>C</b> <b>PROGRAMMING</b> <b>LANGUAGE</b>

       Golf source code translates to C before compilation for maximum performance; as a result, Golf offers the
       ability  to  include  C code directly in extended mode (via <b>call-extended</b> statement and <b>Server-API</b>) which
       means Golf is also an effective framework for C programming language.

       Golf offers simple statements to perform complex common tasks, as well as memory safety. The C code  that
       you'd include via call-extended statement may or may not be memory safe; thus once your application is in
       extended mode (see <b>extended-mode</b>), your application may no longer be memory safe.

       To  make  sure a Golf application is memory safe, simply search for extended-mode statement from the root
       source directory:

           find . -name "*.golf" -print -exec grep -l '^\s*extended-mode' {} \;

       If no matches are found, the application is memory safe.

       However, for applications that are written in C (for performance, access to hardware or OS  features,  or
       for  any  other reason), Golf offers a framework that can offload many tasks from your project, while you
       write C code where it's needed or necessary.

       The benefit is that the part of your application written in Golf (which may be a  vast  majority  of  it)
       offers  memory  safety, ease of development and maintenance, server facilities, lots of functionality, as
       well as high performance to begin with. Your  Golf  code  would  call  your  C  code  when  needed,  thus
       accomplishing the functionality and goals you set out to do.

       Just  as  a  note  of  technicality, when used in extended mode, Golf is considered a framework and not a
       library, because Golf code will call your C code (and not the other way around).
