       permissions - Golf documentation (general)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       File  and  directory  permissions  are  given  with  standard  Linux  permissions. A permission "mode" is
       typically given as an octal number (such as 0750), where each digit is made of read  (carrying  value  of
       4),  write  (carrying  value of 2) and execute/search permissions (carrying value of 1), so for example 7
       means having read, write and execute/search permissions  (since  7=4+2+1).  The  first  digit  refers  to
       permissions given to user, second digit to those given to user's group, and third digit to those given to
       everyone.

       Files  in  Golf <b>directories</b> are generally created with 700 privileges, meaning only the user who owns the
       application can access them and other users (even within the  same  group)  cannot.  The  same  goes  for
       directories created by <b>new-dir</b> by default, unless "mode" specifies differently.

       Files created by Golf (including <b>open-file</b> and <b>write-file</b>) are created with 600 permissions, meaning only
       the user who owns the application can access them and other users (even within the same group) cannot.

       You  can use <b>stat-file</b> to obtain permission mode for a file or directory, and <b>change-mode</b> to set it. Note
       that, most of the time, you won't need to do  this  at  all.  If  you  do,  however,  you  should  change
       permission  modes  carefully  and  keep in mind the implications for both your application's security and
       functionality.
