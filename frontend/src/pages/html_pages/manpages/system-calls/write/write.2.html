</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       write - write to a file descriptor

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C library (<u>libc</u>, <u>-lc</u>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;</b>

       <b>ssize_t</b> <b>write(int</b> <u>fd</u><b>,</b> <b>const</b> <b>void</b> <u>buf</u><b>[.</b><u>count</u><b>],</b> <b>size_t</b> <u>count</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>write</b>()  writes  up  to  <u>count</u>  bytes from the buffer starting at <u>buf</u> to the file referred to by the file
       descriptor <u>fd</u>.

       The number of bytes written may be less than <u>count</u> if, for example, there is insufficient  space  on  the
       underlying  physical medium, or the <b>RLIMIT_FSIZE</b> resource limit is encountered (see <b><a href="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</a></b>(2)), or the
       call was interrupted by a signal handler after having written less than <u>count</u> bytes.  (See also <b><a href="../man7/pipe.7.html">pipe</a></b>(7).)

       For a seekable file (i.e., one to which <b><a href="../man2/lseek.2.html">lseek</a></b>(2) may be applied, for example,  a  regular  file)  writing
       takes  place  at  the  file  offset,  and  the file offset is incremented by the number of bytes actually
       written.  If the file was <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2)ed with <b>O_APPEND</b>, the file offset is first set to the end  of  the  file
       before  writing.   The  adjustment  of the file offset and the write operation are performed as an atomic
       step.

       POSIX requires that a <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2) that can be proved to occur after a <b>write</b>() has returned  will  return  the
       new data.  Note that not all filesystems are POSIX conforming.

       According to POSIX.1, if <u>count</u> is greater than <b>SSIZE_MAX</b>, the result is implementation-defined; see NOTES
       for the upper limit on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       On  success,  the  number  of  bytes  written is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and <u>errno</u> is set to
       indicate the error.

       Note that a successful <b>write</b>() may transfer fewer than <u>count</u> bytes.  Such partial writes  can  occur  for
       various reasons; for example, because there was insufficient space on the disk device to write all of the
       requested  bytes,  or because a blocked <b>write</b>() to a socket, pipe, or similar was interrupted by a signal
       handler after it had transferred some, but before it had transferred all of the requested bytes.  In  the
       event  of a partial write, the caller can make another <b>write</b>() call to transfer the remaining bytes.  The
       subsequent call will either transfer further bytes or may result in an error (e.g., if the  disk  is  now
       full).

       If  <u>count</u> is zero and <u>fd</u> refers to a regular file, then <b>write</b>() may return a failure status if one of the
       errors below is detected.  If no errors are detected, or error detection is not performed, 0 is  returned
       without  causing  any  other effect.  If <u>count</u> is zero and <u>fd</u> refers to a file other than a regular file,
       the results are not specified.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>EAGAIN</b> The file descriptor <u>fd</u> refers to a file other than  a  socket  and  has  been  marked  nonblocking
              (<b>O_NONBLOCK</b>), and the write would block.  See <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2) for further details on the <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> flag.

       <b>EAGAIN</b> or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              The  file  descriptor  <u>fd</u> refers to a socket and has been marked nonblocking (<b>O_NONBLOCK</b>), and the
              write would block.  POSIX.1-2001 allows either error to be returned for this case,  and  does  not
              require  these  constants  to have the same value, so a portable application should check for both
              possibilities.

       <b>EBADF</b>  <u>fd</u> is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for writing.

       <b>EDESTADDRREQ</b>
              <u>fd</u> refers to a datagram socket for which a peer address has not been set using <b><a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</a></b>(2).

       <b>EDQUOT</b> The user's quota of disk blocks on the filesystem containing the file referred to by <u>fd</u>  has  been
              exhausted.

       <b>EFAULT</b> <u>buf</u> is outside your accessible address space.

       <b>EFBIG</b>  An  attempt  was made to write a file that exceeds the implementation-defined maximum file size or
              the process's file size limit, or to write at a position past the maximum allowed offset.

       <b>EINTR</b>  The call was interrupted by a signal before any data was written; see <b><a href="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</a></b>(7).

       <b>EINVAL</b> <u>fd</u> is attached to an object which is unsuitable for writing; or  the  file  was  opened  with  the
              <b>O_DIRECT</b>  flag, and either the address specified in <u>buf</u>, the value specified in <u>count</u>, or the file
              offset is not suitably aligned.

       <b>EIO</b>    A low-level I/O error occurred while modifying the inode.  This error may relate to the write-back
              of data written by an earlier <b>write</b>(), which may have been issued to a different  file  descriptor
              on  the  same file.  Since Linux 4.13, errors from write-back come with a promise that they <u>may</u> be
              reported by subsequent.  <b>write</b>() requests, and <u>will</u> be reported by a subsequent <b><a href="../man2/fsync.2.html">fsync</a></b>(2)  (whether
              or not they were also reported by <b>write</b>()).  An alternate cause of <b>EIO</b> on networked filesystems is
              when  an advisory lock had been taken out on the file descriptor and this lock has been lost.  See
              the <u>Lost</u> <u>locks</u> section of <b><a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</a></b>(2) for further details.

       <b>ENOSPC</b> The device containing the file referred to by <u>fd</u> has no room for the data.

       <b>EPERM</b>  The operation was prevented by a file seal; see <b><a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</a></b>(2).

       <b>EPIPE</b>  <u>fd</u> is connected to a pipe or socket whose reading end is closed.  When this  happens  the  writing
              process  will  also  receive  a <b>SIGPIPE</b> signal.  (Thus, the write return value is seen only if the
              program catches, blocks or ignores this signal.)

       Other errors may occur, depending on the object connected to <u>fd</u>.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.1-2008.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

       Under SVr4 a write may be interrupted and return <b>EINTR</b> at any point, not just before any data is written.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       A successful return from <b>write</b>() does not make any guarantee that data has been committed  to  disk.   On
       some filesystems, including NFS, it does not even guarantee that space has successfully been reserved for
       the data.  In this case, some errors might be delayed until a future <b>write</b>(), <b><a href="../man2/fsync.2.html">fsync</a></b>(2), or even <b><a href="../man2/close.2.html">close</a></b>(2).
       The only way to be sure is to call <b><a href="../man2/fsync.2.html">fsync</a></b>(2) after you are done writing all your data.

       If  a  <b>write</b>()  is interrupted by a signal handler before any bytes are written, then the call fails with
       the error <b>EINTR</b>; if it is interrupted after at least one byte has been written, the  call  succeeds,  and
       returns the number of bytes written.

       On  Linux,  <b>write</b>()  (and  similar  system calls) will transfer at most 0x7ffff000 (2,147,479,552) bytes,
       returning the number of bytes actually transferred.  (This is true on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.)

       An error return value while performing <b>write</b>() using direct I/O  does  not  mean  the  entire  write  has
       failed.   Partial  data may be written and the data at the file offset on which the <b>write</b>() was attempted
       should be considered inconsistent.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       According to POSIX.1-2008/SUSv4 Section XSI 2.9.7 ("Thread Interactions with Regular File Operations"):

           All of the following functions shall be atomic with respect to each other in the effects specified in
           POSIX.1-2008 when they operate on regular files or symbolic links: ...

       Among the APIs subsequently listed are <b>write</b>() and <b><a href="../man2/writev.2.html">writev</a></b>(2).  And  among  the  effects  that  should  be
       atomic  across  threads (and processes) are updates of the file offset.  However, before Linux 3.14, this
       was not the case: if two processes that share an open file description (see <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2))  perform  a  <b>write</b>()
       (or  <b><a href="../man2/writev.2.html">writev</a></b>(2))  at  the  same time, then the I/O operations were not atomic with respect to updating the
       file offset, with the result that the blocks of data output by  the  two  processes  might  (incorrectly)
       overlap.  This problem was fixed in Linux 3.14.
