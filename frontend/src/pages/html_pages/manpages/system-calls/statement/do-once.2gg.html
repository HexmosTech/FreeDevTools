</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       do-once -  (program-flow)

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       Execute statements only once in a process.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
            do-once
               &lt;any statements&gt;
               ...
            end-do-once

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       do-once  will execute &lt;any statements&gt; only once in a single process regardless of how many requests that
       process serves. &lt;any statements&gt; end with end-do-once. The first time a  process  reaches  do-once,  &lt;any
       statements&gt; will execute; in all subsequent cases the program control will skip to immediately after end-
       do-once.

       do-once cannot be nested, but otherwise can be used any number of times.

       Typical use of do-once may be making any calls that need to be performed only once per process, or it may
       be a one-time setup of process-scoped variables, or anything else that needs to execute just once for all
       requests served by the same process.

       &lt;any statements&gt; execute in the nested scope relative to the code surrounding do-once/end-do-once, except
       that  any  process-scoped variables are created in the same scope as the code surrounding do-once/end-do-
       once; this simplifies creation of process-scoped variables, if needed.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       In this example, a process-scoped hash (that is available to multiple requests of a  single  process)  is
       created  in the very first request a process serves and data is written to it; the subsequent requests do
       not create a new hash but rather just write to it.

           ...
            do-once
               new-hash my_hash hash-size 1024 process-scope
            end-do-once
            write-hash my_hash key my_key value my_data
            ...
