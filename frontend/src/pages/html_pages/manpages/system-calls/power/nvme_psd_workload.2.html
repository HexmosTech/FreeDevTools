       enum  nvme_psd_workload  -  Specifies  a  workload  hint  in  the  Power  Management Feature (see &amp;struct
       nvme_psd.apw) to inform the NVM subsystem or indicate the conditions for the active power level.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       enum nvme_psd_workload {
           <b>NVME_PSD_WORKLOAD_NP</b> ,
           <b>NVME_PSD_WORKLOAD_1</b> ,
           <b>NVME_PSD_WORKLOAD_2</b>

       };

       NVME_PSD_WORKLOAD_NP
                   The workload is unknown or not provided.

       NVME_PSD_WORKLOAD_1
                   Extended Idle Period with a Burst of Random Write consists of five minutes of  idle  followed
                   by  thirty-two random write commands of size 1 MiB submitted to a single controller while all
                   other controllers in the NVM subsystem are idle, and then thirty (30) seconds of idle.

       NVME_PSD_WORKLOAD_2
                   Heavy Sequential Writes consists  of  80,000  sequential  write  commands  of  size  128  KiB
                   submitted  to  a single controller while all other controllers in the NVM subsystem are idle.
                   The submission queue(s) should be sufficiently large allowing the host to  ensure  there  are
                   multiple commands pending at all times during the workload.
