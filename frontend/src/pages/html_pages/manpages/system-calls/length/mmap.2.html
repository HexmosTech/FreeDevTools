       mmap, munmap - map or unmap files or devices into memory

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C library (<u>libc</u>, <u>-lc</u>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</b>

       <b>void</b> <b>*mmap(void</b> <u>addr</u><b>[.</b><u>length</u><b>],</b> <b>size_t</b> <u>length</u><b>,</b> <b>int</b> <u>prot</u><b>,</b> <b>int</b> <u>flags</u><b>,</b>
                  <b>int</b> <u>fd</u><b>,</b> <b>off_t</b> <u>offset</u><b>);</b>
       <b>int</b> <b>munmap(void</b> <u>addr</u><b>[.</b><u>length</u><b>],</b> <b>size_t</b> <u>length</u><b>);</b>

       See NOTES for information on feature test macro requirements.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mmap</b>()  creates  a new mapping in the virtual address space of the calling process.  The starting address
       for the new mapping is specified in <u>addr</u>.  The <u>length</u> argument specifies the length of the mapping (which
       must be greater than 0).

       If <u>addr</u> is NULL, then the kernel chooses the (page-aligned) address at which to create the mapping;  this
       is  the most portable method of creating a new mapping.  If <u>addr</u> is not NULL, then the kernel takes it as
       a hint about where to place the mapping; on Linux, the kernel will  pick  a  nearby  page  boundary  (but
       always  above  or  equal  to the value specified by <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr">/proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr</a></u>) and attempt to create the
       mapping there.  If another mapping already exists there, the kernel picks a new address that may  or  may
       not depend on the hint.  The address of the new mapping is returned as the result of the call.

       The  contents  of  a  file  mapping  (as  opposed  to an anonymous mapping; see <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> below), are
       initialized using <u>length</u> bytes starting at offset <u>offset</u> in the file (or other object) referred to by the
       file descriptor <u>fd</u>.  <u>offset</u> must be a multiple of the page size as returned by <u>sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE)</u>.

       After the <b>mmap</b>() call  has  returned,  the  file  descriptor,  <u>fd</u>,  can  be  closed  immediately  without
       invalidating the mapping.

       The  <u>prot</u> argument describes the desired memory protection of the mapping (and must not conflict with the
       open mode of the file).  It is either <b>PROT_NONE</b> or the bitwise OR of one or more of the following flags:

       <b>PROT_EXEC</b>  Pages may be executed.

       <b>PROT_READ</b>  Pages may be read.

       <b>PROT_WRITE</b> Pages may be written.

       <b>PROT_NONE</b>  Pages may not be accessed.

   <b>The</b> <b>flags</b> <b>argument</b>
       The <u>flags</u> argument determines whether updates to the mapping are visible to other processes  mapping  the
       same region, and whether updates are carried through to the underlying file.  This behavior is determined
       by including exactly one of the following values in <u>flags</u>:

       <b>MAP_SHARED</b>
              Share  this  mapping.   Updates  to  the  mapping  are visible to other processes mapping the same
              region, and (in the case of file-backed mappings) are carried through to the underlying file.  (To
              precisely control when updates are carried through to the underlying  file  requires  the  use  of
              <b><a href="../man2/msync.2.html">msync</a></b>(2).)

       <b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</b> (since Linux 4.15)
              This  flag provides the same behavior as <b>MAP_SHARED</b> except that <b>MAP_SHARED</b> mappings ignore unknown
              flags in <u>flags</u>.  By contrast, when  creating  a  mapping  using  <b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</b>,  the  kernel
              verifies  all  passed  flags are known and fails the mapping with the error <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b> for unknown
              flags.  This mapping type is also required to be able to use some mapping flags (e.g., <b>MAP_SYNC</b>).

       <b>MAP_PRIVATE</b>
              Create a private copy-on-write mapping.  Updates to the mapping are not visible to other processes
              mapping the same file, and are not carried through to the  underlying  file.   It  is  unspecified
              whether changes made to the file after the <b>mmap</b>() call are visible in the mapped region.

       Both <b>MAP_SHARED</b> and <b>MAP_PRIVATE</b> are described in POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008.  <b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</b> is a
       Linux extension.

       In addition, zero or more of the following values can be ORed in <u>flags</u>:

       <b>MAP_32BIT</b> (since Linux 2.4.20, 2.6)
              Put  the  mapping into the first 2 Gigabytes of the process address space.  This flag is supported
              only on x86-64, for 64-bit programs.  It  was  added  to  allow  thread  stacks  to  be  allocated
              somewhere  in  the first 2 GB of memory, so as to improve context-switch performance on some early
              64-bit processors.  Modern x86-64 processors no longer have this performance problem,  so  use  of
              this flag is not required on those systems.  The <b>MAP_32BIT</b> flag is ignored when <b>MAP_FIXED</b> is set.

       <b>MAP_ANON</b>
              Synonym for <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b>; provided for compatibility with other implementations.

       <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b>
              The  mapping  is not backed by any file; its contents are initialized to zero.  The <u>fd</u> argument is
              ignored; however, some implementations require <u>fd</u> to be  -1  if  <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b>  (or  <b>MAP_ANON</b>)  is
              specified,  and  portable  applications  should  ensure this.  The <u>offset</u> argument should be zero.
              Support for <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> in conjunction with <b>MAP_SHARED</b> was added in Linux 2.4.

       <b>MAP_DENYWRITE</b>
              This flag is ignored.  (Long ago—Linux 2.0 and earlier—it signaled that attempts to write  to  the
              underlying file should fail with <b>ETXTBSY</b>.  But this was a source of denial-of-service attacks.)

       <b>MAP_EXECUTABLE</b>
              This flag is ignored.

       <b>MAP_FILE</b>
              Compatibility flag.  Ignored.

       <b>MAP_FIXED</b>
              Don't  interpret <u>addr</u> as a hint: place the mapping at exactly that address.  <u>addr</u> must be suitably
              aligned: for most architectures  a  multiple  of  the  page  size  is  sufficient;  however,  some
              architectures  may  impose  additional  restrictions.   If the memory region specified by <u>addr</u> and
              <u>length</u> overlaps pages of any existing  mapping(s),  then  the  overlapped  part  of  the  existing
              mapping(s) will be discarded.  If the specified address cannot be used, <b>mmap</b>() will fail.

              Software that aspires to be portable should use the <b>MAP_FIXED</b> flag with care, keeping in mind that
              the  exact  layout of a process's memory mappings is allowed to change significantly between Linux
              versions, C library versions, and operating system releases.  <u>Carefully</u>  <u>read</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>discussion</u>  <u>of</u>
              <u>this</u> <u>flag</u> <u>in</u> <u>NOTES!</u>

       <b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</b> (since Linux 4.17)
              This flag provides behavior that is similar to <b>MAP_FIXED</b> with respect to the <u>addr</u> enforcement, but
              differs  in  that <b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</b> never clobbers a preexisting mapped range.  If the requested
              range would collide with an existing mapping, then this call fails with the  error  <b>EEXIST.</b>   This
              flag  can  therefore be used as a way to atomically (with respect to other threads) attempt to map
              an address range: one thread will succeed; all others will report failure.

              Note that older kernels which do not recognize the <b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</b> flag will  typically  (upon
              detecting a collision with a preexisting mapping) fall back to a “non-<b>MAP_FIXED</b>” type of behavior:
              they  will  return  an address that is different from the requested address.  Therefore, backward-
              compatible software should check the returned address against the requested address.

       <b>MAP_GROWSDOWN</b>
              This flag is used for stacks.  It indicates to the kernel virtual memory system that  the  mapping
              should  extend downward in memory.  The return address is one page lower than the memory area that
              is actually created in the process's virtual address space.  Touching an address  in  the  "guard"
              page  below  the  mapping  will  cause the mapping to grow by a page.  This growth can be repeated
              until the mapping grows to within a page of the high end of the next lower mapping, at which point
              touching the "guard" page will result in a <b>SIGSEGV</b> signal.

       <b>MAP_HUGETLB</b> (since Linux 2.6.32)
              Allocate   the   mapping   using   "huge"   pages.    See   the   Linux   kernel    source    file
              <u>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.rst</u> for further information, as well as NOTES, below.

       <b>MAP_HUGE_2MB</b>
       <b>MAP_HUGE_1GB</b> (since Linux 3.8)
              Used  in conjunction with <b>MAP_HUGETLB</b> to select alternative hugetlb page sizes (respectively, 2 MB
              and 1 GB) on systems that support multiple hugetlb page sizes.

              More generally, the desired huge page size can be configured by encoding the base-2  logarithm  of
              the  desired page size in the six bits at the offset <b>MAP_HUGE_SHIFT</b>.  (A value of zero in this bit
              field provides the default huge page size; the default huge page size can be  discovered  via  the
              <u>Hugepagesize</u> field exposed by <u><a href="file:/proc/meminfo">/proc/meminfo</a></u>.)  Thus, the above two constants are defined as:

                  #define MAP_HUGE_2MB    (21 &lt;&lt; MAP_HUGE_SHIFT)
                  #define MAP_HUGE_1GB    (30 &lt;&lt; MAP_HUGE_SHIFT)

              The  range  of  huge  page sizes that are supported by the system can be discovered by listing the
              subdirectories in <u><a href="file:/sys/kernel/mm/hugepages">/sys/kernel/mm/hugepages</a></u>.

       <b>MAP_LOCKED</b> (since Linux 2.5.37)
              Mark the mapped region to be locked in the same way as <b><a href="../man2/mlock.2.html">mlock</a></b>(2).  This implementation will try  to
              populate  (prefault)  the  whole range but the <b>mmap</b>() call doesn't fail with <b>ENOMEM</b> if this fails.
              Therefore major faults might happen later on.  So the semantic is not as strong as <b><a href="../man2/mlock.2.html">mlock</a></b>(2).   One
              should  use  <b>mmap</b>() plus <b><a href="../man2/mlock.2.html">mlock</a></b>(2) when major faults are not acceptable after the initialization of
              the mapping.  The <b>MAP_LOCKED</b> flag is ignored in older kernels.

       <b>MAP_NONBLOCK</b> (since Linux 2.5.46)
              This flag is meaningful only in conjunction with <b>MAP_POPULATE</b>.  Don't perform  read-ahead:  create
              page tables entries only for pages that are already present in RAM.  Since Linux 2.6.23, this flag
              causes  <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> to do nothing.  One day, the combination of <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> and <b>MAP_NONBLOCK</b> may
              be reimplemented.

       <b>MAP_NORESERVE</b>
              Do not reserve swap space for this mapping.  When swap space is reserved, one  has  the  guarantee
              that  it is possible to modify the mapping.  When swap space is not reserved one might get <b>SIGSEGV</b>
              upon a write  if  no  physical  memory  is  available.   See  also  the  discussion  of  the  file
              <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory">/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</a></u>  in  <b><a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</a></b>(5).   Before  Linux  2.6,  this  flag had effect only for
              private writable mappings.

       <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> (since Linux 2.5.46)
              Populate (prefault) page tables for a mapping.  For a file mapping, this causes read-ahead on  the
              file.   This  will  help to reduce blocking on page faults later.  The <b>mmap</b>() call doesn't fail if
              the mapping cannot be populated (for example, due to limitations on  the  number  of  mapped  huge
              pages  when using <b>MAP_HUGETLB</b>).  Support for <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> in conjunction with private mappings was
              added in Linux 2.6.23.

       <b>MAP_STACK</b> (since Linux 2.6.27)
              Allocate the mapping at an address suitable for a process or thread stack.

              This flag is currently a no-op on Linux.  However, by employing this flag, applications can ensure
              that they transparently obtain support if the flag is implemented in the future.  Thus, it is used
              in the glibc threading implementation to allow for the fact that some  architectures  may  (later)
              require  special  treatment  for  stack  allocations.   A  further  reason  to employ this flag is
              portability: <b>MAP_STACK</b> exists (and has an effect) on some other systems (e.g., some of the BSDs).

       <b>MAP_SYNC</b> (since Linux 4.15)
              This flag is available only with the <b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</b> mapping type; mappings of type <b>MAP_SHARED</b>
              will silently ignore this flag.  This flag is supported only  for  files  supporting  DAX  (direct
              mapping  of  persistent memory).  For other files, creating a mapping with this flag results in an
              <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b> error.

              Shared file mappings with this flag provide  the  guarantee  that  while  some  memory  is  mapped
              writable  in  the  address  space  of the process, it will be visible in the same file at the same
              offset even after the system crashes or is rebooted.  In conjunction with the use  of  appropriate
              CPU  instructions,  this  provides users of such mappings with a more efficient way of making data
              modifications persistent.

       <b>MAP_UNINITIALIZED</b> (since Linux 2.6.33)
              Don't clear anonymous pages.  This flag is intended to improve performance  on  embedded  devices.
              This  flag  is  honored only if the kernel was configured with the <b>CONFIG_MMAP_ALLOW_UNINITIALIZED</b>
              option.  Because of the security implications, that option is normally enabled  only  on  embedded
              devices (i.e., devices where one has complete control of the contents of user memory).

       Of  the above flags, only <b>MAP_FIXED</b> is specified in POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008.  However, most systems
       also support <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> (or its synonym <b>MAP_ANON</b>).

   <b>munmap()</b>
       The <b>munmap</b>() system call deletes the mappings  for  the  specified  address  range,  and  causes  further
       references  to  addresses  within  the  range  to generate invalid memory references.  The region is also
       automatically unmapped when the process is terminated.  On the other hand, closing  the  file  descriptor
       does not unmap the region.

       The  address  <u>addr</u>  must be a multiple of the page size (but <u>length</u> need not be).  All pages containing a
       part of the indicated range are unmapped, and subsequent references to these pages will generate <b>SIGSEGV</b>.
       It is not an error if the indicated range does not contain any mapped pages.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       On success, <b>mmap</b>() returns a pointer to the mapped area.   On  error,  the  value  <b>MAP_FAILED</b>  (that  is,
       <u>(void</u> <u>*)</u> <u>-1</u>) is returned, and <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

       On  success,  <b>munmap</b>()  returns  0.   On  failure,  it returns -1, and <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error
       (probably to <b>EINVAL</b>).

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>EACCES</b> A file descriptor refers to a non-regular file.  Or a file mapping was requested, but  <u>fd</u>  is  not
              open  for  reading.   Or  <b>MAP_SHARED</b>  was  requested  and <b>PROT_WRITE</b> is set, but <u>fd</u> is not open in
              read/write (<b>O_RDWR</b>) mode.  Or <b>PROT_WRITE</b> is set, but the file is append-only.

       <b>EAGAIN</b> The file has been locked, or too much memory has been locked (see <b><a href="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</a></b>(2)).

       <b>EBADF</b>  <u>fd</u> is not a valid file descriptor (and <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> was not set).

       <b>EEXIST</b> <b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</b> was specified in <u>flags</u>, and the range covered by <u>addr</u> and <u>length</u> clashes  with
              an existing mapping.

       <b>EINVAL</b> We  don't  like  <u>addr</u>,  <u>length</u>,  or  <u>offset</u>  (e.g.,  they  are too large, or not aligned on a page
              boundary).

       <b>EINVAL</b> (since Linux 2.6.12) <u>length</u> was 0.

       <b>EINVAL</b> <u>flags</u> contained none of <b>MAP_PRIVATE</b>, <b>MAP_SHARED</b>, or <b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</b>.

       <b>ENFILE</b> The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       <b>ENODEV</b> The underlying filesystem of the specified file does not support memory mapping.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> No memory is available.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> The process's maximum number of mappings would have been exceeded.  This error can also occur  for
              <b>munmap</b>(),  when unmapping a region in the middle of an existing mapping, since this results in two
              smaller mappings on either side of the region being unmapped.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> (since Linux 4.7) The process's <b>RLIMIT_DATA</b> limit, described  in  <b><a href="../man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit</a></b>(2),  would  have  been
              exceeded.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> We don't like <u>addr</u>, because it exceeds the virtual address space of the CPU.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              On  32-bit  architecture  together  with  the large file extension (i.e., using 64-bit <u>off_t</u>): the
              number of pages used for <u>length</u> plus number of pages used for <u>offset</u> would overflow <u>unsigned</u>  <u>long</u>
              (32 bits).

       <b>EPERM</b>  The  <u>prot</u>  argument  asks for <b>PROT_EXEC</b> but the mapped area belongs to a file on a filesystem that
              was mounted no-exec.

       <b>EPERM</b>  The operation was prevented by a file seal; see <b><a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</a></b>(2).

       <b>EPERM</b>  The <b>MAP_HUGETLB</b> flag was  specified,  but  the  caller  was  not  privileged  (did  not  have  the
              <b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b>  capability)  and  is  not  a  member  of the <u>sysctl_hugetlb_shm_group</u> group; see the
              description of <u>/proc/sys/vm/sysctl_hugetlb_shm_group</u> in <b><a href="../man5/proc_sys.5.html">proc_sys</a></b>(5).

       <b>ETXTBSY</b>
              <b>MAP_DENYWRITE</b> was set but the object specified by <u>fd</u> is open for writing.

       Use of a mapped region can result in these signals:

       <b>SIGSEGV</b>
              Attempted write into a region mapped as read-only.

       <b>SIGBUS</b> Attempted access to a page of the buffer that lies beyond the end of  the  mapped  file.   For  an
              explanation of the treatment of the bytes in the page that corresponds to the end of a mapped file
              that is not a multiple of the page size, see NOTES.

</pre><h4><b>VERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       On  some hardware architectures (e.g., i386), <b>PROT_WRITE</b> implies <b>PROT_READ</b>.  It is architecture dependent
       whether <b>PROT_READ</b> implies <b>PROT_EXEC</b> or not.  Portable programs should always set <b>PROT_EXEC</b> if they intend
       to execute code in the new mapping.

       The portable way to create a mapping is to specify <u>addr</u> as 0 (NULL), and omit <b>MAP_FIXED</b> from  <u>flags</u>.   In
       this  case,  the  system chooses the address for the mapping; the address is chosen so as not to conflict
       with any existing mapping, and will not be 0.  If the <b>MAP_FIXED</b> flag is specified, and <u>addr</u> is 0  (NULL),
       then the mapped address will be 0 (NULL).

       Certain  <u>flags</u>  constants  are  defined  only  if  suitable  feature test macros are defined (possibly by
       default): <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b> with glibc 2.19 or later; or <b>_BSD_SOURCE</b> or  <b>_SVID_SOURCE</b>  in  glibc  2.19  and
       earlier.   (Employing  <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b>  also  suffices, and requiring that macro specifically would have been
       more  logical,  since  these  flags  are  all  Linux-specific.)   The  relevant  flags  are:   <b>MAP_32BIT</b>,
       <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b>  (and  the  synonym  <b>MAP_ANON</b>),  <b>MAP_DENYWRITE</b>,  <b>MAP_EXECUTABLE</b>,  <b>MAP_FILE</b>,  <b>MAP_GROWSDOWN</b>,
       <b>MAP_HUGETLB</b>, <b>MAP_LOCKED</b>, <b>MAP_NONBLOCK</b>, <b>MAP_NORESERVE</b>, <b>MAP_POPULATE</b>, and <b>MAP_STACK</b>.

   <b>C</b> <b>library/kernel</b> <b>differences</b>
       This page describes the interface provided by  the  glibc  <b>mmap</b>()  wrapper  function.   Originally,  this
       function  invoked  a system call of the same name.  Since Linux 2.4, that system call has been superseded
       by <b><a href="../man2/mmap2.2.html">mmap2</a></b>(2), and nowadays the glibc <b>mmap</b>() wrapper function invokes <b><a href="../man2/mmap2.2.html">mmap2</a></b>(2)  with  a  suitably  adjusted
       value for <u>offset</u>.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.1-2008.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.1-2001, SVr4, 4.4BSD.

       On POSIX systems on which <b>mmap</b>(), <b><a href="../man2/msync.2.html">msync</a></b>(2), and <b>munmap</b>() are available, <b>_POSIX_MAPPED_FILES</b> is defined in
       <u>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</u> to a value greater than 0.  (See also <b><a href="../man3/sysconf.3.html">sysconf</a></b>(3).)

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Memory mapped by <b>mmap</b>() is preserved across <b><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></b>(2), with the same attributes.

       A  file is mapped in multiples of the page size.  For a file that is not a multiple of the page size, the
       remaining bytes in the partial page at the end of the mapping are zeroed when mapped,  and  modifications
       to  that  region are not written out to the file.  The effect of changing the size of the underlying file
       of a mapping on the pages that correspond to added or removed regions of the file is unspecified.

       An application can determine which pages of a mapping are currently resident  in  the  buffer/page  cache
       using <b><a href="../man2/mincore.2.html">mincore</a></b>(2).

   <b>Using</b> <b>MAP_FIXED</b> <b>safely</b>
       The  only  safe  use for <b>MAP_FIXED</b> is where the address range specified by <u>addr</u> and <u>length</u> was previously
       reserved using another mapping; otherwise, the use of <b>MAP_FIXED</b> is hazardous because it forcibly  removes
       preexisting mappings, making it easy for a multithreaded process to corrupt its own address space.

       For  example,  suppose  that  thread  A looks through <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/maps</u> in order to locate an unused address
       range that it can map using <b>MAP_FIXED</b>, while thread B simultaneously acquires part or all  of  that  same
       address  range.   When  thread  A  subsequently  employs <b>mmap(MAP_FIXED)</b>, it will effectively clobber the
       mapping that thread B created.  In this scenario, thread B need not create  a  mapping  directly;  simply
       making  a  library call that, internally, uses <b><a href="../man3/dlopen.3.html">dlopen</a></b>(3) to load some other shared library, will suffice.
       The <b><a href="../man3/dlopen.3.html">dlopen</a></b>(3) call will map the library into  the  process's  address  space.   Furthermore,  almost  any
       library call may be implemented in a way that adds memory mappings to the address space, either with this
       technique,  or  by  simply allocating memory.  Examples include <b><a href="../man2/brk.2.html">brk</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man3/malloc.3.html">malloc</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/pthread_create.3.html">pthread_create</a></b>(3), and
       the PAM libraries <a href="http://www.linux-pam.org">http://www.linux-pam.org</a>.

       Since Linux 4.17, a multithreaded program can use  the  <b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</b>  flag  to  avoid  the  hazard
       described  above  when  attempting to create a mapping at a fixed address that has not been reserved by a
       preexisting mapping.

   <b>Timestamps</b> <b>changes</b> <b>for</b> <b>file-backed</b> <b>mappings</b>
       For file-backed mappings, the <u>st_atime</u> field for the mapped file may be updated at any time  between  the
       <b>mmap</b>()  and the corresponding unmapping; the first reference to a mapped page will update the field if it
       has not been already.

       The <u>st_ctime</u> and <u>st_mtime</u> field for a file mapped with <b>PROT_WRITE</b> and <b>MAP_SHARED</b> will be updated after  a
       write  to  the  mapped region, and before a subsequent <b><a href="../man2/msync.2.html">msync</a></b>(2) with the <b>MS_SYNC</b> or <b>MS_ASYNC</b> flag, if one
       occurs.

   <b>Huge</b> <b>page</b> <b>(Huge</b> <b>TLB)</b> <b>mappings</b>
       For mappings that employ huge pages, the requirements for the arguments of  <b>mmap</b>()  and  <b>munmap</b>()  differ
       somewhat from the requirements for mappings that use the native system page size.

       For  <b>mmap</b>(), <u>offset</u> must be a multiple of the underlying huge page size.  The system automatically aligns
       <u>length</u> to be a multiple of the underlying huge page size.

       For <b>munmap</b>(), <u>addr</u>, and <u>length</u> must both be a multiple of the underlying huge page size.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       On Linux, there are no guarantees like those  suggested  above  under  <b>MAP_NORESERVE</b>.   By  default,  any
       process can be killed at any moment when the system runs out of memory.

       Before Linux 2.6.7, the <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> flag has effect only if <u>prot</u> is specified as <b>PROT_NONE</b>.

       SUSv3  specifies  that <b>mmap</b>() should fail if <u>length</u> is 0.  However, before Linux 2.6.12, <b>mmap</b>() succeeded
       in this case: no mapping was created and the call returned <u>addr</u>.  Since Linux 2.6.12, <b>mmap</b>()  fails  with
       the error <b>EINVAL</b> for this case.

       POSIX specifies that the system shall always zero fill any partial page at the end of the object and that
       system  will never write any modification of the object beyond its end.  On Linux, when you write data to
       such partial page after the end of the object, the data stays in the page cache even after  the  file  is
       closed and unmapped and even though the data is never written to the file itself, subsequent mappings may
       see  the modified content.  In some cases, this could be fixed by calling <b><a href="../man2/msync.2.html">msync</a></b>(2) before the unmap takes
       place; however, this doesn't work on <b><a href="../man5/tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs</a></b>(5) (for example, when using the POSIX shared memory  interface
       documented in <b><a href="../man7/shm_overview.7.html">shm_overview</a></b>(7)).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  program  prints part of the file specified in its first command-line argument to standard
       output.  The range of bytes to be printed is specified via offset and length values  in  the  second  and
       third command-line arguments.  The program creates a memory mapping of the required pages of the file and
       then uses <b><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></b>(2) to output the desired bytes.
