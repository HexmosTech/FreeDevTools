       sprog       Sanitize  Progress  (SPROG):  indicates  the fraction complete of the sanitize operation. The
                   value is a numerator of the fraction complete that has 65,536 (10000h)  as  its  denominator.
                   This   value   shall   be   set   to   FFFFh   if   the   <u>sstat</u>   field   is   not   set   to
                   NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_STATUS_IN_PROGESS.

       sstat       Sanitize Status (SSTAT): indicates the  status  associated  with  the  most  recent  sanitize
                   operation. See <u>enum</u> <u>nvme_sanitize_sstat</u>.

       scdw10      Sanitize  Command  Dword  10 Information (SCDW10): contains the value of the Command Dword 10
                   field of the Sanitize command that started the sanitize operation.

       eto         Estimated Time For Overwrite: indicates  the  number  of  seconds  required  to  complete  an
                   Overwrite sanitize operation with 16 passes in the background when the No-Deallocate Modifies
                   Media  After  Sanitize  field  is  not  set to 10b. A value of 0h indicates that the sanitize
                   operation is expected to be completed in  the  background  when  the  Sanitize  command  that
                   started  that  operation  is completed. A value of FFFFFFFFh indicates that no time period is
                   reported.

       etbe        Estimated Time For Block Erase: indicates the number of seconds required to complete a  Block
                   Erase  sanitize  operation  in  the  background  when  the No-Deallocate Modifies Media After
                   Sanitize field is not set to 10b. A value of 0h indicates  that  the  sanitize  operation  is
                   expected  to  be  completed  in  the  background  when the Sanitize command that started that
                   operation is completed.  A value of FFFFFFFFh indicates that no time period is reported.

       etce        Estimated Time For Crypto Erase: indicates the number  of  seconds  required  to  complete  a
                   Crypto Erase sanitize operation in the background when the No-Deallocate Modifies Media After
                   Sanitize  field  is  not  set  to 10b. A value of 0h indicates that the sanitize operation is
                   expected to be completed in the background  when  the  Sanitize  command  that  started  that
                   operation is completed.  A value of FFFFFFFFh indicates that no time period is reported.

       etond       Estimated  Time  For Overwrite With No-Deallocate Media Modification: indicates the number of
                   seconds required to complete an Overwrite sanitize operation and  the  associated  additional
                   media  modification  after  the  Overwrite  sanitize operation in the background when the No-
                   Deallocate After Sanitize bit was set to  1  in  the  Sanitize  command  that  requested  the
                   Overwrite  sanitize  operation;  and the No-Deallocate Modifies Media After Sanitize field is
                   set to 10b.  A value of 0h indicates that the sanitize operation is expected to be  completed
                   in the background when the Sanitize command that started that operation is completed. A value
                   of FFFFFFFFh indicates that no time period is reported.

       etbend      Estimated Time For Block Erase With No-Deallocate Media Modification: indicates the number of
                   seconds  required  to complete a Block Erase sanitize operation and the associated additional
                   media modification after the Block Erase sanitize operation in the background  when  the  No-
                   Deallocate  After  Sanitize  bit  was  set  to  1  in the Sanitize command that requested the
                   Overwrite sanitize operation; and the No-Deallocate Modifies Media After  Sanitize  field  is
                   set  to 10b.  A value of 0h indicates that the sanitize operation is expected to be completed
                   in the background when the Sanitize command that started that operation is completed. A value
                   of FFFFFFFFh indicates that no time period is reported.

       etcend      Estimated Time For Crypto Erase With No-Deallocate Media Modification: indicates  the  number
                   of  seconds  required  to  complete  a  Crypto  Erase  sanitize  operation and the associated
                   additional media modification after the Crypto Erase sanitize  operation  in  the  background
                   when the No-Deallocate After Sanitize bit was set to 1 in the Sanitize command that requested
                   the  Overwrite  sanitize operation; and the No-Deallocate Modifies Media After Sanitize field
                   is set to 10b.  A value of 0h indicates  that  the  sanitize  operation  is  expected  to  be
                   completed  in  the  background  when  the  Sanitize  command  that  started that operation is
                   completed. A value of FFFFFFFFh indicates that no time period is reported.

       etpvds      Estimated Time For Post-Verification Deallocation State:  indicates  the  number  of  seconds
                   required to deallocate all media allocated for user data after exiting the Media Verification
                   state  (i.e.,  the  time  difference  between  entering  and  exiting  the  Post-Verification
                   Deallocation state), if that state is entered as part of the sanitize operation. A  value  of
                   FFFFFFFFh indicates that no time period is reported.

       ssi         Sanitize State Information: indicate the state of the Sanitize Operation State Machine.
