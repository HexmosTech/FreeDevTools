       dsts        Device  Self-test Status: Indicates the device self-test code and the status of the operation
                   (see <u>enum</u> <u>nvme_status_result</u> and <u>enum</u> <u>nvme_st_code</u>).

       seg         Segment Number: Iindicates the segment number where the first self-test failure occurred.  If
                   Device  Self-test Status (<u>dsts</u>) is not set to #NVME_ST_RESULT_KNOWN_SEG_FAIL, then this field
                   should be ignored.

       vdi         Valid Diagnostic Information: Indicates the diagnostic failure information that is  reported.
                   See <u>enum</u> <u>nvme_st_valid_diag_info</u>.

       rsvd        Reserved

       poh         Power On Hours (POH): Indicates the number of power-on hours at the time the device self-test
                   operation  was  completed  or  aborted.  This  does  not include time that the controller was
                   powered and in a low power state condition.

       nsid        Namespace Identifier (NSID): Indicates the namespace that the Failing LBA occurred on.  Valid
                   only  when  the NSID Valid bit (#NVME_ST_VALID_DIAG_INFO_NSID) is set in the Valid Diagnostic
                   Information (<u>vdi</u>) field.

       flba        Failing LBA: indicates the LBA of the logical block that caused the  test  to  fail.  If  the
                   device  encountered  more than one failed logical block during the test, then this field only
                   indicates  one  of  those  failed  logical  blocks.  Valid  only  when  the  NSID  Valid  bit
                   (#NVME_ST_VALID_DIAG_INFO_FLBA) is set in the Valid Diagnostic Information (<u>vdi</u>) field.

       sct         Status  Code  Type:  This  field  may  contain  additional  information  related to errors or
                   conditions. Bits 2:0 may contain additional information relating to errors or conditions that
                   occurred during the device self-test operation represented in the same  format  used  in  the
                   Status  Code  Type  field  of  the  completion queue entry (refer to <u>enum</u> <u>nvme_status_field</u>).
                   Valid only when the NSID  Valid  bit  (#NVME_ST_VALID_DIAG_INFO_SCT)  is  set  in  the  Valid
                   Diagnostic Information (<u>vdi</u>) field.

       sc          Status  Code:  This field may contain additional information relating to errors or conditions
                   that occurred during the device self-test operation represented in the same  format  used  in
                   the  Status  Code  field  of  the  completion  queue entry. Valid only when the SCT Valid bit
                   (#NVME_ST_VALID_DIAG_INFO_SC) is set in the Valid Diagnostic Information (<u>vdi</u>) field.
