       memory-handling - Golf documentation (memory)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Golf is a memory-safe language.

       Your  application cannot access memory outside of valid statement results. Trying to do so will result in
       your program <b>erroring</b> <b>out</b>.

       Memory allocated by Golf statements is tracked and freed at the end of the request.

       With Golf there is no need to free memory manually. Memory is automatically freed even if it is no longer
       accessible to the program, thus preventing memory leaks; this is important for stability of  long-running
       processes.

       Some  statements  (<b>new-tree</b>,  <b>new-hash</b>, <b>new-list</b>, <b>new-array</b> and <b>set-string</b>) have the option of allocating
       memory that won't get freed at the end of the request and is available to any request served by the  same
       process. This kind of memory is called "process-scoped". A process-scoped string can be manually freed.

       Golf handles memory references and assignments automatically, preventing dangling memory.

       String results of any Golf <b>statements</b> will always create new memory, unless stated otherwise.

       <b>OPEN</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>DESCRIPTORS</b>

       Any  files opened by <b>open-file</b> statement are automatically closed by Golf at the end of the request. This
       enhances stability of long-running server processes because Linux system by  default  offers  only  about
       1000  open  files  to a process. A bug can quickly exhaust this pool and cause a malfunction or a crash -
       Golf prevents this by closing any such open files when the request ends.
