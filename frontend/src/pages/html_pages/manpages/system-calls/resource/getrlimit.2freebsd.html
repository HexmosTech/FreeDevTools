       getrlimit, setrlimit — control maximum system resource consumption

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</b>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/time.h&gt;</b>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/resource.h&gt;</b>

       <u>int</u>
       <b>getrlimit</b>(<u>int</u> <u>resource</u>, <u>struct</u> <u>rlimit</u> <u>*rlp</u>);

       <u>int</u>
       <b>setrlimit</b>(<u>int</u> <u>resource</u>, <u>const</u> <u>struct</u> <u>rlimit</u> <u>*rlp</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Limits  on  the consumption of system resources by the current process and each process it creates may be
       obtained with the <b>getrlimit</b>() system call, and set with the <b>setrlimit</b>() system call.

       The <u>resource</u> argument is one of the following:

       RLIMIT_AS       The maximum amount (in bytes) of virtual memory the process is allowed to map.

       RLIMIT_CORE     The largest size (in bytes) <u><a href="../man5/core.5.html">core</a></u>(5) file that may be created.

       RLIMIT_CPU      The maximum amount of cpu time (in seconds) to be used by each process.

       RLIMIT_DATA     The maximum size (in bytes) of the data segment for a process; this  defines  how  far  a
                       program may extend its break with the <u><a href="../man2/sbrk.2.html">sbrk</a></u>(2) function.

       RLIMIT_FSIZE    The largest size (in bytes) file that may be created.

       RLIMIT_KQUEUES  The maximum number of kqueues this user id is allowed to create.

       RLIMIT_MEMLOCK  The  maximum  size  (in  bytes)  which  a process may lock into memory using the <u><a href="../man2/mlock.2.html">mlock</a></u>(2)
                       system call.

       RLIMIT_NOFILE   The maximum number of open files for this process.

       RLIMIT_NPROC    The maximum number of simultaneous processes for this user id.

       RLIMIT_NPTS     The maximum number of pseudo-terminals this user id is allowed to create.

       RLIMIT_RSS      When there is memory pressure and swap is available, prioritize eviction  of  a  process'
                       resident  pages  beyond  this amount (in bytes).  When memory is not under pressure, this
                       rlimit is effectively ignored.  Even  when  there  is  memory  pressure,  the  amount  of
                       available    swap   space   and   some   sysctl   settings   like   <u>vm.swap_enabled</u>   and
                       <u>vm.swap_idle_enabled</u> can affect what happens to processes that have exceeded this size.

                       Processes that exceed their set RLIMIT_RSS are not signalled or  halted.   The  limit  is
                       merely  a  hint  to  the VM daemon to prefer to deactivate pages from processes that have
                       exceeded their set RLIMIT_RSS.

       RLIMIT_SBSIZE   The maximum size (in bytes) of socket buffer usage for this user.  This limits the amount
                       of network memory, and hence the amount of mbufs, that this user may hold at any time.

       RLIMIT_STACK    The maximum size (in bytes) of the stack segment for a process; this defines  how  far  a
                       program's  stack  segment may be extended.  Stack extension is performed automatically by
                       the system.

       RLIMIT_SWAP     The maximum size (in bytes) of the swap space that may be reserved or used by all of this
                       user id's processes.  This limit is enforced only if bit 1 of the <u>vm.overcommit</u> sysctl is
                       set.  Please see <u><a href="../man7/tuning.7.html">tuning</a></u>(7) for a complete description of this sysctl.

       RLIMIT_VMEM     An alias for RLIMIT_AS.

       A resource limit is specified as a soft limit and a hard limit.  When a soft limit is exceeded, a process
       might or might not receive a signal.  For example, signals are generated when the cpu time or  file  size
       is  exceeded,  but  not  if  the address space or RSS limit is exceeded.  A program that exceeds the soft
       limit is allowed to continue execution until it reaches the hard limit,  or  modifies  its  own  resource
       limit.   Even  reaching the hard limit does not necessarily halt a process.  For example, if the RSS hard
       limit is exceeded, nothing happens.

       The <u>rlimit</u> structure is used to specify the hard and soft limits on a resource.

             struct rlimit {
                     rlim_t  rlim_cur;       /* current (soft) limit */
                     rlim_t  rlim_max;       /* maximum value for rlim_cur */
             };

       Only the super-user may raise the maximum limits.  Other users may only alter <u>rlim_cur</u> within  the  range
       from 0 to <u>rlim_max</u> or (irreversibly) lower <u>rlim_max</u>.

       An “infinite” value for a limit is defined as RLIM_INFINITY.

       Because  this  information  is  stored  in the per-process information, this system call must be executed
       directly by the shell if it is to affect all future processes created by  the  shell;  <b>limit</b>  is  thus  a
       built-in command to <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1).

       The system refuses to extend the data or stack space when the limits would be exceeded in the normal way:
       a <u><a href="../man2/brk.2.html">brk</a></u>(2) function fails if the data space limit is reached.  When the stack limit is reached, the process
       receives  a  segmentation  fault  (SIGSEGV);  if  this signal is not caught by a handler using the signal
       stack, this signal will kill the process.

       A file I/O operation that would create a file larger that the process' soft limit will cause the write to
       fail and a signal SIGXFSZ to be generated; this normally terminates the process, but may be caught.  When
       the soft cpu time limit is exceeded, a SIGXCPU signal is sent to the offending process.

       When most operations would allocate more virtual memory than allowed by the soft limit of RLIMIT_AS,  the
       operation  fails  with ENOMEM and no signal is raised.  A notable exception is stack extension, described
       above.  If stack extension would allocate  more  virtual  memory  than  allowed  by  the  soft  limit  of
       RLIMIT_AS,  a SIGSEGV signal will be delivered.  The caller is free to raise the soft address space limit
       up to the hard limit and retry the allocation.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, the value 0 is returned; otherwise the value -1 is returned  and  the  global
       variable <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>getrlimit</b>() and <b>setrlimit</b>() system calls will fail if:

       [EFAULT]           The address specified for <u>rlp</u> is invalid.

       [EPERM]            The  limit specified to <b>setrlimit</b>() would have raised the maximum limit value, and the
                          caller is not the super-user.
