       <u>int</u>
       <b>getrusage</b>(<u>int</u> <u>who</u>, <u>struct</u> <u>rusage</u> <u>*rusage</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>getrusage</b>() system call returns information describing the resources utilized by the current thread,
       the current process, or all its terminated child processes.  The <u>who</u> argument  is  either  RUSAGE_THREAD,
       RUSAGE_SELF,  or RUSAGE_CHILDREN.  The buffer to which <u>rusage</u> points will be filled in with the following
       structure:

       struct rusage {
               struct timeval ru_utime; /* user time used */
               struct timeval ru_stime; /* system time used */
               long ru_maxrss;          /* max resident set size */
               long ru_ixrss;           /* integral shared text memory size */
               long ru_idrss;           /* integral unshared data size */
               long ru_isrss;           /* integral unshared stack size */
               long ru_minflt;          /* page reclaims */
               long ru_majflt;          /* page faults */
               long ru_nswap;           /* swaps */
               long ru_inblock;         /* block input operations */
               long ru_oublock;         /* block output operations */
               long ru_msgsnd;          /* messages sent */
               long ru_msgrcv;          /* messages received */
               long ru_nsignals;        /* signals received */
               long ru_nvcsw;           /* voluntary context switches */
               long ru_nivcsw;          /* involuntary context switches */
       };

       The fields are interpreted as follows:

       <u>ru_utime</u>     the total amount of time spent executing in user mode.

       <u>ru_stime</u>     the total amount of time spent in the system executing on behalf of the process(es).

       <u>ru_maxrss</u>    the maximum resident set size utilized (in kilobytes).

       <u>ru_ixrss</u>     an “integral” value indicating the amount of memory used by the text segment that  was  also
                    shared  among  other  processes.   This value is expressed in units of kilobytes * ticks-of-
                    execution.  Ticks are statistics clock ticks.  The  statistics  clock  has  a  frequency  of
                    <b>sysconf</b>(<b>_</b><u>SC_CLK_TCK</u>) ticks per second.

       <u>ru_idrss</u>     an integral value of the amount of unshared memory residing in the data segment of a process
                    (expressed in units of kilobytes * ticks-of-execution).

       <u>ru_isrss</u>     an  integral  value  of  the  amount  of  unshared memory residing in the stack segment of a
                    process (expressed in units of kilobytes * ticks-of-execution).

       <u>ru_minflt</u>    the number of page faults serviced without any I/O activity; here I/O activity is avoided by
                    “reclaiming” a page frame from the list of pages awaiting reallocation.

       <u>ru_majflt</u>    the number of page faults serviced that required I/O activity.

       <u>ru_nswap</u>     the number of times a process was “swapped” out of main memory.

       <u>ru_inblock</u>   the number of times the file system had to perform input.

       <u>ru_oublock</u>   the number of times the file system had to perform output.

       <u>ru_msgsnd</u>    the number of IPC messages sent.

       <u>ru_msgrcv</u>    the number of IPC messages received.

       <u>ru_nsignals</u>  the number of signals delivered.

       <u>ru_nvcsw</u>     the number of times a context switch resulted due to a process  voluntarily  giving  up  the
                    processor before its time slice was completed (usually to await availability of a resource).

       <u>ru_nivcsw</u>    the  number  of  times  a  context switch resulted due to a higher priority process becoming
                    runnable or because the current process exceeded its time slice.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The numbers <u>ru_inblock</u> and <u>ru_oublock</u> account only for real I/O; data supplied by the  caching  mechanism
       is charged only to the first process to read or write the data.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>getrusage</b>()  function  returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the
       global variable <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>getrusage</b>() system call will fail if:

       [EINVAL]           The <u>who</u> argument is not a valid value.

       [EFAULT]           The address specified by the <u>rusage</u> argument is not in a valid  part  of  the  process
                          address space.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>getrusage</b>()  system  call  appeared  in  4.2BSD.   The  RUSAGE_THREAD  facility  first  appeared  in
       FreeBSD 8.1.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There is no way to obtain information about a child process that has not yet terminated.
