</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>WHAT</b> <b>IS</b> <b>IT</b>

       Golf  is  a  memory-safe  and  high-performance  programming  language  and application server. Golf is a
       compiled language that creates native executables. It's main purpose is easy and  rapid  development  and
       deployment of web services and applications on Linux back-end.

       Golf  is built with industry-standard Free Open Source libraries, extensible with C programming language,
       and licensed under <b>Apache</b> <b>2</b> Free Open Source.

       <b>SERVICE</b> <b>ORIENTED</b>

       A Golf program works as a service provider, meaning it handles service <b>request</b>s by providing a reply.  It
       can  be  either  a  <b>service</b> or a <b>command-line</b> program that processes GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE or any
       other HTTP requests.

       The URL for a request must state the application name, and a also request name which is the  source  file
       handling   it.   So,   "/app-name/my-request"   means  that  application  name  is  "app-name"  and  that
       "request_name.golf" file will implement a request handler. A request executes in this order:

           • An optional before-handler handler executes (see <b>before-handler</b>).

           • Golf's <b>request</b> <b>dispatcher</b> executes a <b>request</b> handler.

           • An optional after-handler handler executes (see <b>after-handler</b>).

       <b>RUNNING</b> <b>AS</b> <b>A</b> <b>SERVICE</b>

       A Golf service is served by either

           • a fixed number of service processes, or

           • a dynamic number based on the request load, from 0 to any maximum number specified.
       Each Golf service process handles one request at a time, and all such processes work  in  parallel.  This
       means  you  do not need to worry about thread-safety with Golf. Server processes generally stay up across
       any number of requests, increasing response time. The balance between the number  of  processes  and  the
       memory  usage  during  high  request  loads can be achieved with adaptive feature of <b>mgrg</b>, Golf's service
       process manager.

       A service can be requested by:

           • reverse proxies, such as Apache, Nginx, HAProxy etc.,

           • programs written in any language using <b>Client-API</b>,

           • Golf's own <b>gg</b> utility (see -r option)

           • another Golf service by means of <b>call-remote</b> (on secure networks) and  <b>call-web</b>  (on  the  web  via
           SSL/TSL secure connections).

       With  <b>call-remote</b>,  you can execute remote requests in parallel, and get results, error messages and exit
       status in a single statement. This makes it easy to distribute and  parallelize  your  application  logic
       and/or  build  application tiers on a local or any number of remote machines, without having to write any
       multi-threaded code.

       <b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>PROGRAM</b>

       A <b>command-line</b> program handles a single request before it exits. This may be suitable for batch jobs, for
       use in shell scripts, for testing/mocking, as well as any other situation where  it  is  more  useful  or
       convenient  to execute a command-line program. Note that a command-line program can double as <b>CGI</b> (Common
       Gateway Interface) as well.

       <b>USAGE</b>

       Golf services and command-line programs can implement most back-end application layers, including

           • presentation (eg. building a web page),

           • application logic,

           • data (eg. database) layers, and any others.

       <b>LANGUAGE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SAFETY</b>

       Golf programming language is memory-safe, meaning it  will  prevent  you  from  accidentally  overwriting
       memory  or  freeing it when it shouldn't be. Golf's <b>memory-handling</b> is not limited to just memory safety;
       it also includes automatic freeing of memory at the end of a request, preventing memory leaks  which  can
       be fatal to long running processes. Similarly, files open with file-handling statements are automatically
       closed at the end of each request, serving the same purpose.

       Golf  goes  a  step  further from memory safety. It also enforces status checking for statements that may
       cause serious application logic errors. This is done by checking for negative status outcome at run-time,
       but only if your code does not check for status, and by stopping the  application  if  it  happens.  This
       provides for much safer application run-time because it prevents further execution of the program if such
       outcome  happens,  and  it  also  forces  the  developer to add necessary status checks when needed. This
       feature is automatic and has an extremely low impact on performance.

       <b>TYPES</b>

       Golf is a strongly-typed language, with only three primitive types (numbers, strings and booleans) and  a
       number  of  structured  types (message, split-string, hash, tree, tree-cursor, fifo, lifo, list, file and
       service). Golf is a declarative language, with a few lines of code  implementing  large  functionalities.
       Golf is also very simple - it's near expression-free! That's because it's designed to achieve application
       goals with less coding.

       The  number  type is a signed 64-bit integer (as a decimal, octal or hexadecimal C notation). The boolean
       type evaluates to true (non-zero) or false (zero). The string type evaluates to  any  sequence  of  bytes
       (binary  or  text)  that  is  always  trailed  with  a null character regardless, which is not counted in
       string's length. All constants follow C rules of formatting.

       <b>STATEMENTS</b>

       Golf <b>statements</b> are designed for safety, ease of use, and ability to write stable code.  Most  statements
       typically  perform  common complex tasks with options to easily customize them; such options are compile-
       time whenever possible, increasing run-time performance.

       <b>VARIABLES,</b> <b>SCOPE</b>

       A variable is created the first time it's encountered in any given scope, and is never created  again  in
       the same or inner scopes, which avoids common bugs involving more than one variable with the same name in
       related scopes. You can still of course create variables with the same name in unrelated scopes.

       Some  structured  types (hash, tree, list) as well as primitive types (numbers, strings and booleans) can
       be created with process-scope, meaning their value persists throughout any requests served  by  the  same
       process.  This  is  useful  for  making  services  that  allow keeping and fast querying of data (such as
       caches).

       Numbers and booleans are assigned by value, while strings are assigned by reference (for  obvious  reason
       to avoid unnecessary copying).

       <b>INFRASTRUCTURE</b>

       Golf  includes  request-processing  and all the necessary infrastructure, such as for process management,
       files, networking, service protocols, database, string processing etc.

       <b>PERFORMANCE</b>

       Golf is a compiled language. Golf applications are high-performance native executables by  design,  hence
       absolutely  no  byte-code, interpreters and similar. Since Golf is declarative, just a few <b>statements</b> are
       needed to implement lots of functionality. These statements are implemented in pure C, and are not slowed
       down by memory checks as they are safe internally by  implementation.  Only  developer-facing  Golf  code
       needs  additional  logic to enforce memory safety, and that's a very small part of overall run-time cost.
       This means Golf can truly be memory-safe and high-performance at the same time.

       <b>DATABASE</b> <b>ACCESS</b>

       Golf provides access to a number of popular databases, such as MariaDB/mySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite. (see
       <b>database-config-file</b>):

           • transactional support (begin, commit, rollback),

           • protection against SQL injections for safety,

           • automatic and persistent database connections with unlimited reuse across all SQL queries for  high
           performance,

           • prepared SQL statements for high performance.

       <b>PROVEN</b> <b>LIBRARIES</b>

       Golf  uses  well-known  and  widely  used Free Open Source libraries like cURL, OpenSSL, crypto, FastCGI,
       standard  database-connectivity  libraries  from  MariaDB,  PostgreSQL,  SQLite  etc.,  for   compliance,
       performance and reliability.

       <b>WEB</b> <b>FRAMEWORK</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>C</b> <b>PROGRAMMING</b> <b>LANGUAGE</b>

       In extended mode, Golf is also a <b>web-framework-for-C-programming-language</b>.

       <b>NAMES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>OBJECTS</b>

       Do  not use object names (such as variables and request names) that start with "_gg_" or "gg_" (including
       upper-case variations) as those are reserved by Golf.

       <b>HISTORY</b>

       Golf programming language (or golf-lang) was  created  by  Sergio  Mijatovic,  formerly  Senior  Software
       Engineer  with  Oracle  server  engineering group. Golf was originally known as Vely (since 2018), before
       being redesigned into Golf in late 2024.
