</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       file-uploading -  (files)

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       Upload a file to server.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
           get-param &lt;name&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Files uploaded via client (such as a browser, curl etc.) are obtained via <b>get-param</b>.

       Golf  uploads  files  via HTML automatically, meaning you do not have to write any code for that specific
       purpose. An uploaded file will be stored in <b>file-storage</b>, with path and name of such a file generated  by
       Golf     to     be     unique.     For     example,     a     file     uploaded     might     be    named
       "/var/lib/gg/app_name/app//file/d0/f31881". When file is uploaded, the following input parameters can  be
       obtained, in this case assuming "name" attribute of HTML "input" element is "myfile":

           • "myfile_filename" is the name of the file as provided by the client.

           •   "myfile_location"   is   the   full   path   on   the  server  where  file  is  stored  (such  as
           "/var/lib/gg/app_name/app//file/d0/f31881" for example)

           • "myfile_ext" is the extension of the file, for example ".jpg"  or  ".pdf".  Note  that  ".jpeg"  is
           always showing as ".jpg". The extension is always lower case.

           •  "myfile_size"  is  the size of the file uploaded, as a string. See <b>gg</b> for setting the maximum file
           upload size.

       For example, for an HTML form which is uploading a file named "myfile", such as

           &lt;input type='file' name='myfile'&gt;

       your code that handles this might be:

           get-param myfile_filename
           get-param myfile_location
           get-param myfile_ext
           get-param myfile_size

           You have uploaded file &lt;&lt;p-web myfile_filename&gt;&gt; to a server file at &lt;&lt;p-web myfile_location&gt;&gt;
