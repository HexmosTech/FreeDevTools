</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       basis - finite element method (rheolef-7.2)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The class constructor takes a string that characterizes the finite element method, e.g. 'P0', 'P1' or
       'P2'. The letters characterize the finite element family and the number is the polynomial degree in this
       family. The finite element also depends upon the reference element, e.g. triangle, square, tetrahedron,
       etc. See <b><a href="../man6/reference_element.6.html">reference_element</a>(6)</b> for more details. For instance, on the square reference element, the 'P1'
       string designates the common Q1 four-nodes finite element.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABLE</b> <b>FINITE</b> <b>ELEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Pk

            The classical Lagrange finite element family, where k is any polynomial degree greater or equal to
           1.

       Pkd

            The discontinuous Galerkin finite element family, where k is any polynomial degree greater or equal
           to 0. For convenience, P0d could also be written as P0.

       bubble

            The product of baycentric coordinates. Only simplicial elements are supported: <b><a href="../man6/edge.6.html">edge</a>(6)</b>, <b><a href="../man6/triangle.6.html">triangle</a>(6)</b>
           and <b><a href="../man6/tetrahedron.6.html">tetrahedron</a>(6)</b>.

       RTk
       RTkd

            The vector-valued Raviart-Thomas family, where k is any polynomial degree greater or equal to 0. The
           RTkd piecewise discontinuous version is fully implemented for the <b><a href="../man6/triangle.6.html">triangle</a>(6)</b>. Its RTk continuous
           counterpart is still under development.

       Bk

            The Bernstein finite element family, where k is any polynomial degree greater or equal to 1. This
           basis was initially introduced by Bernstein (Comm. Soc. Math. Kharkov, 2th series, 1912) and more
           recently used in the context of finite elements. This feature is still under development.

       Sk

            The spectral finite element family, as proposed by Sherwin and Karniadakis (Oxford University Press,
           2nd ed., 2005). Here, k is any polynomial degree greater or equal to 1. This feature is still under
           development.

</pre><h4><b>CONTINUOUS</b> <b>FEATURE</b></h4><pre>
       Some finite element families could support either continuous or discontinuous junction at inter-element
       boundaries. For instance, the Pk Lagrange finite element family, with k &gt;= 1, has a continuous
       interelements junction: it defines a piecewise polynomial and globally continuous finite element
       functional <b><a href="../man2/space.2.html">space</a>(2)</b>. Conversely, the Pkd Lagrange finite element family, with k &gt;= 0, has a discontinuous
       interelements junction: it defines a piecewise polynomial and globally discontinuous finite element
       functional <b><a href="../man2/space.2.html">space</a>(2)</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The basis class supports some options associated to each finite element method. These options are
       appended to the string bewteen square braces, and are separated by a coma, e.g. 'P5[feteke,bernstein]'.
       See <b><a href="../man1/basis.1.html">basis</a>(1)</b> for some examples.

</pre><h4><b>LAGRANGE</b> <b>NODES</b> <b>OPTION</b></h4><pre>
       equispaced

            Nodes are equispaced. This is the default.

       fekete

            Node are non-equispaced: for high-order polynomial degree, e.g. greater or equal to 3, their
           placement is fully optimized, as proposed by Taylor, Wingate and Vincent, 2000, SIAM J. Numer. Anal.
           With this choice, the interpolation error is dramatically decreased for high order polynomials. This
           feature is still restricted to the triangle reference element and to polynomial degree lower or equal
           to 19. Otherwise, it fall back to the following warburton node set.

       warburton

            Node are non-equispaced: for high-order polynomial degree, e.g. greater or equal to 3, their
           placement is optimized thought an heuristic solution, as proposed by Warburton, 2006, J. Eng. Math.
           With this choice, the interpolation error is dramatically decreased for high order polynomials. This
           feature applies to any reference element and polynomial degree.

</pre><h4><b>RAW</b> <b>POLYNOMIAL</b> <b>BASIS</b></h4><pre>
       The raw (or initial) polynomial basis is used for building the dual basis, associated to degrees of
       freedom, via the Vandermonde matrix and its inverse. Changing the raw basis do not change the definition
       of the FEM basis, but only the way it is constructed. There are three possible raw basis:

       monomial

            The monomial basis is the simplest choice. While it is suitable for low polynomial degree (less than
           five), for higher polynomial degree, the Vandermonde matrix becomes ill-conditioned and its inverse
           leads to errors in double precision.

       dubiner

            The Dubiner basis (see Dubiner, 1991 J. Sci. Comput.) leads to much better condition number. This is
           the default.

       bernstein

            The Bernstein basis could also be an alternative raw basis.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNALS:</b> <b>EVALUATE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>INTERPOLATE</b></h4><pre>
       The basis class defines member functions that evaluates all the polynomial basis functions of a finite
       element and their derivatives at a point or a set of point.

       The basis polynomial functions are evaluated by the evaluate member function. This member function is
       called during the assembly process of the <b><a href="../man3/integrate.3.html">integrate</a>(3)</b> function.

       The interpolation nodes used by the <b><a href="../man3/interpolate.3.html">interpolate</a>(3)</b> function are available by the member function
       hat_node. Conversely, the member function compute_dofs compute the degrees of freedom.

</pre><h4><b>IMPLEMENTATION</b></h4><pre>
