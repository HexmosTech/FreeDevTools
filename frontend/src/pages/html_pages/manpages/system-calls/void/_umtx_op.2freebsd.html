       _umtx_op — interface for implementation of userspace threading synchronization primitives

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</b>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/umtx.h&gt;</b>

       <u>int</u>
       <b>_umtx_op</b>(<u>void</u> <u>*obj</u>, <u>int</u> <u>op</u>, <u>u_long</u> <u>val</u>, <u>void</u> <u>*uaddr</u>, <u>void</u> <u>*uaddr2</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>_umtx_op</b>()  system  call  provides  kernel  support  for  userspace  implementation of the threading
       synchronization primitives.  The 1:1 Threading Library (libthr, -lthr) uses the syscall to implement IEEE
       Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”) pthread locks, like mutexes, condition variables and so on.

   <b>STRUCTURES</b>
       The operations, performed by the <b>_umtx_op</b>() syscall, operate on userspace objects which are described  by
       the  following  structures.   Reserved fields and paddings are omitted.  All objects require ABI-mandated
       alignment, but this is not currently enforced consistently on all architectures.

       The following flags are defined for flag fields of all structures:

       USYNC_PROCESS_SHARED
               Allow selection of the process-shared sleep queue for the thread sleep container, when  the  lock
               ownership  cannot  be  granted  immediately, and the operation must sleep.  The process-shared or
               process-private sleep queue is selected based on the  attributes  of  the  memory  mapping  which
               contains  the first byte of the structure, see <u><a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a></u>(2).  Otherwise, if the flag is not specified,
               the process-private sleep queue is selected regardless of the memory mapping  attributes,  as  an
               optimization.

               See the “SLEEP QUEUES” subsection below for more details on sleep queues.

             <b>Mutex</b>

                     struct umutex {
                             volatile lwpid_t m_owner;
                             uint32_t         m_flags;
                             uint32_t         m_ceilings[2];
                             uintptr_t        m_rb_lnk;
                     };

                     The m_owner field is the actual lock.  It contains either the thread identifier of the lock
                     owner in the locked state, or zero when the lock is unowned.  The highest bit set indicates
                     that there is contention on the lock.  The constants are defined for special values:

                     UMUTEX_UNOWNED
                             Zero, the value stored in the unowned lock.

                     UMUTEX_CONTESTED
                             The contention indicator.

                     UMUTEX_RB_OWNERDEAD
                             A thread owning the robust mutex terminated.  The mutex is in unlocked state.

                     UMUTEX_RB_NOTRECOV
                             The  robust  mutex  is  in  a  non-recoverable  state.   It  cannot be locked until
                             reinitialized.

                     The m_flags field may contain the following  umutex-specific  flags,  in  addition  to  the
                     common flags:

                     UMUTEX_PRIO_INHERIT
                             Mutex implements <u>Priority</u> <u>Inheritance</u> protocol.

                     UMUTEX_PRIO_PROTECT
                             Mutex implements <u>Priority</u> <u>Protection</u> protocol.

                     UMUTEX_ROBUST
                             Mutex is robust, as described in the “ROBUST UMUTEXES” section below.

                     UMUTEX_NONCONSISTENT
                             Robust mutex is in a transient non-consistent state.  Not used by kernel.

                     In  the  manual  page, mutexes not having UMUTEX_PRIO_INHERIT and UMUTEX_PRIO_PROTECT flags
                     set, are called normal mutexes.   Each  type  of  mutex  (normal,  priority-inherited,  and
                     priority-protected) has a separate sleep queue associated with the given key.

                     For priority protected mutexes, the m_ceilings array contains priority ceiling values.  The
                     m_ceilings[0]  is  the  ceiling  value  for the mutex, as specified by IEEE Std 1003.1-2008
                     (“POSIX.1”) for the <u>Priority</u> <u>Protected</u> mutex protocol.  The m_ceilings[1] is used only  for
                     the  unlock  of  a priority protected mutex, when unlock is done in an order other than the
                     reversed lock order.  In this case, m_ceilings[1] must contain the ceiling  value  for  the
                     last  locked  priority protected mutex, for proper priority reassignment.  If, instead, the
                     unlocking mutex was the last priority propagated mutex locked by the thread,  m_ceilings[1]
                     should  contain  -1.   This  is  required because kernel does not maintain the ordered lock
                     list.

             <b>Condition</b> <b>variable</b>

                     struct ucond {
                             volatile uint32_t c_has_waiters;
                             uint32_t          c_flags;
                             uint32_t          c_clockid;
                     };

                     A non-zero  c_has_waiters  value  indicates  that  there  are  in-kernel  waiters  for  the
                     condition, executing the UMTX_OP_CV_WAIT request.

                     The c_flags field contains flags.  Only the common flags (USYNC_PROCESS_SHARED) are defined
                     for ucond.

                     The  c_clockid  member  provides  the  clock  identifier  to  use  for  timeout,  when  the
                     UMTX_OP_CV_WAIT request has both the CVWAIT_CLOCKID flag and the timeout specified.   Valid
                     clock identifiers are a subset of those for <u><a href="../man2/clock_gettime.2.html">clock_gettime</a></u>(2):

             <b>Reader/writer</b> <b>lock</b>

                     struct urwlock {
                             volatile int32_t rw_state;
                             uint32_t         rw_flags;
                             uint32_t         rw_blocked_readers;
                             uint32_t         rw_blocked_writers;
                     };

                     The  rw_state field is the actual lock.  It contains both the flags and counter of the read
                     locks which were granted.  Names of the rw_state bits are following:

                     URWLOCK_WRITE_OWNER
                             Write lock was granted.

                     URWLOCK_WRITE_WAITERS
                             There are write lock waiters.

                     URWLOCK_READ_WAITERS
                             There are read lock waiters.

                     URWLOCK_READER_COUNT(c)
                             Returns the count of currently granted read locks.

                     At any given time there may be only one thread to which the writer lock is granted  on  the
                     <u>struct</u>  <u>rwlock</u>,  and  no  threads  are  granted  read  lock.   Or, at the given time, up to
                     URWLOCK_MAX_READERS threads may be granted the read lock simultaneously, but write lock  is
                     not granted to any thread.

                     The  following  flags for the rw_flags member of <u>struct</u> <u>urwlock</u> are defined, in addition to
                     the common flags:

                     URWLOCK_PREFER_READER
                             If specified, immediately grant read lock requests when urwlock  is  already  read-
                             locked,  even in presence of unsatisfied write lock requests.  By default, if there
                             is a write lock waiter, further read requests are not granted,  to  prevent  unfair
                             write lock waiter starvation.

                     The  rw_blocked_readers  and  rw_blocked_writers members contain the count of threads which
                     are sleeping in kernel, waiting for the associated request type to be granted.  The  fields
                     are  used  by  kernel to update the URWLOCK_READ_WAITERS and URWLOCK_WRITE_WAITERS flags of
                     the rw_state lock after requesting thread was woken up.

             <b>Semaphore</b>

                     struct _usem2 {
                             volatile uint32_t _count;
                             uint32_t          _flags;
                     };

                     The _count word represents a counting semaphore.  A non-zero value  indicates  an  unlocked
                     (posted)  semaphore,  while  zero  represents  the  locked  state.   The  maximal supported
                     semaphore count is USEM_MAX_COUNT.

                     The _count word, besides the counter of posts (unlocks), also contains the USEM_HAS_WAITERS
                     bit, which indicates that locked semaphore has waiting threads.

                     The USEM_COUNT() macro, applied to the _count word, returns the current semaphore  counter,
                     which is the number of posts issued on the semaphore.

                     The  following  bits for the _flags member of <u>struct</u> <b>_</b><u>usem2</u> are defined, in addition to the
                     common flags:

                     USEM_NAMED
                             Flag is ignored by kernel.

             <b>Timeout</b> <b>parameter</b>

                     struct _umtx_time {
                             struct timespec _timeout;
                             uint32_t        _flags;
                             uint32_t        _clockid;
                     };

                     Several <b>_umtx_op</b>() operations allow the blocking time to be limited, failing the request if
                     it cannot be satisfied in the specified time period.  The timeout is specified  by  passing
                     either  the  address of <u>struct</u> <u>timespec</u>, or its extended variant, <u>struct</u> <b>_</b><u>umtx_time</u>, as the
                     <u>uaddr2</u> argument of <b>_umtx_op</b>().  They are distinguished by the <u>uaddr</u> value,  which  must  be
                     equal to the size of the structure pointed to by <u>uaddr2</u>, casted to <u>uintptr_t</u>.

                     The  _timeout  member  specifies  the time when the timeout should occur.  Legal values for
                     clock identifier _clockid are shared with the <u>clock_id</u>  argument  to  the  <u><a href="../man2/clock_gettime.2.html">clock_gettime</a></u>(2)
                     function,  and  use  the same underlying clocks.  The specified clock is used to obtain the
                     current time value.  Interval counting is always performed by the monotonic wall clock.

                     The _flags argument allows the following flags to further define the timeout behaviour:

                     UMTX_ABSTIME
                             The _timeout value is the absolute time.  The thread  will  be  unblocked  and  the
                             request failed when specified clock value is equal or exceeds the _timeout.

                             If  the  flag is absent, the timeout value is relative, that is the amount of time,
                             measured by the monotonic wall clock from the moment of the request start.

   <b>SLEEP</b> <b>QUEUES</b>
       When a locking request cannot be immediately satisfied, the thread is typically put to <u>sleep</u>, which is  a
       non-runnable state terminated by the <u>wake</u> operation.  Lock operations include a <u>try</u> variant which returns
       an  error  rather than sleeping if the lock cannot be obtained.  Also, <b>_umtx_op</b>() provides requests which
       explicitly put the thread to sleep.

       Wakes need to know which threads to make runnable, so sleeping threads are grouped into containers called
       <u>sleep</u> <u>queues</u>.  A sleep queue is identified by a key, which for <b>_umtx_op</b>()  is  defined  as  the  physical
       address  of some variable.  Note that the <u>physical</u> address is used, which means that same variable mapped
       multiple times will give one key value.  This mechanism enables the construction of <u>process-shared</u> locks.

       A related attribute of the key is shareability.  Some requests always interpret keys as private  for  the
       current  process,  creating  sleep  queues  with  the  scope of the current process even if the memory is
       shared.  Others either select the  shareability  automatically  from  the  mapping  attributes,  or  take
       additional  input  as  the  USYNC_PROCESS_SHARED common flag.  This is done as optimization, allowing the
       lock scope to be limited regardless of the kind of backing memory.

       Only the address of the start byte of  the  variable  specified  as  key  is  important  for  determining
       corresponding  sleep queue.  The size of the variable does not matter, so, for example, sleep on the same
       address interpeted as <u>uint32_t</u> and <u>long</u> on a little-endian 64-bit platform would collide.

       The last attribute of the key is the object type.  The sleep queue to which a sleeping thread is assigned
       is an individual one for simple wait requests, mutexes, rwlocks, condvars and other primitives, even when
       the physical address of the key is same.

       When waking up a limited number of threads from a given sleep queue, the highest  priority  threads  that
       have been blocked for the longest on the queue are selected.

   <b>ROBUST</b> <b>UMUTEXES</b>
       The  <u>robust</u>  <u>umutexes</u>  are  provided  as  a  substrate  for a userspace library to implement POSIX robust
       mutexes.  A robust umutex must have the UMUTEX_ROBUST flag set.

       On thread termination, the kernel walks two lists of mutexes.  The  two  lists  head  addresses  must  be
       provided by a prior call to UMTX_OP_ROBUST_LISTS request.  The lists are singly-linked.  The link to next
       element is provided by the m_rb_lnk member of the <u>struct</u> <u>umutex</u>.

       Robust list processing is aborted if the kernel finds a mutex with any of the following conditions:
             <b>-</b>   the UMUTEX_ROBUST flag is not set
             <b>-</b>   not  owned  by  the  current thread, except when the mutex is pointed to by the robust_inactive
                 member of the <u>struct</u> <u>umtx_robust_lists_params</u>, registered for the current thread
             <b>-</b>   the combination of mutex flags is invalid
             <b>-</b>   read of the umutex memory faults
             <b>-</b>   the list length limit described in <u><a href="../man3/libthr.3.html">libthr</a></u>(3) is reached.

       Every mutex in both lists is unlocked as if the UMTX_OP_MUTEX_UNLOCK request  is  performed  on  it,  but
       instead  of  the  UMUTEX_UNOWNED  value, the m_owner field is written with the UMUTEX_RB_OWNERDEAD value.
       When a mutex in the UMUTEX_RB_OWNERDEAD state is locked by kernel due to  the  UMTX_OP_MUTEX_TRYLOCK  and
       UMTX_OP_MUTEX_LOCK requests, the lock is granted and EOWNERDEAD error is returned.

       Also,  the  kernel  handles the UMUTEX_RB_NOTRECOV value of the m_owner field specially, always returning
       the ENOTRECOVERABLE error for lock attempts, without granting the lock.

   <b>OPERATIONS</b>
       The following operations, requested by the <u>op</u> argument to the function, are implemented:

       UMTX_OP_WAIT
               Wait.  The arguments for the request are:

               <u>obj</u>  Pointer to a variable of type <u>long</u>.

               <u>val</u>  Current value of the *obj.

               The current value of the variable pointed to by the <u>obj</u> argument is compared with  the  <u>val</u>.   If
               they  are  equal,  the  requesting  thread  is  put  to interruptible sleep until woken up or the
               optionally specified timeout expires.

               The comparison and sleep are atomic.  In other words, if another thread writes  a  new  value  to
               *obj  and then issues UMTX_OP_WAKE, the request is guaranteed to not miss the wakeup, which might
               otherwise happen between comparison and blocking.

               The physical address of memory where the <u>*obj</u> variable is located, is used  as  a  key  to  index
               sleeping threads.

               The read of the current value of the *obj variable is not guarded by barriers.  In particular, it
               is  the  user's duty to ensure the lock acquire and release memory semantics, if the UMTX_OP_WAIT
               and UMTX_OP_WAKE requests are used as a substrate for implementing a simple lock.

               The request is not restartable.  An unblocked signal delivered during the wait always results  in
               sleep interruption and EINTR error.

               Optionally, a timeout for the request may be specified.

       UMTX_OP_WAKE
               Wake the threads possibly sleeping due to UMTX_OP_WAIT.  The arguments for the request are:

               <u>obj</u>  Pointer to a variable, used as a key to find sleeping threads.

               <u>val</u>  Up to <u>val</u> threads are woken up by this request.  Specify INT_MAX to wake up all waiters.

       UMTX_OP_MUTEX_TRYLOCK
               Try to lock umutex.  The arguments to the request are:

               <u>obj</u>  Pointer to the umutex.

               Operates  same  as  the  UMTX_OP_MUTEX_LOCK request, but returns EBUSY instead of sleeping if the
               lock cannot be obtained immediately.

       UMTX_OP_MUTEX_LOCK
               Lock umutex.  The arguments to the request are:

               <u>obj</u>  Pointer to the umutex.

               Locking is performed by writing the current thread id into the m_owner word of the <u>struct</u> <u>umutex</u>.
               The write is atomic, preserves  the  UMUTEX_CONTESTED  contention  indicator,  and  provides  the
               acquire barrier for lock entrance semantic.

               If  the  lock  cannot  be  obtained immediately because another thread owns the lock, the current
               thread is put to sleep, with UMUTEX_CONTESTED bit set before.  Upon wake up, the lock  conditions
               are re-tested.

               The request adheres to the priority protection or inheritance protocol of the mutex, specified by
               the UMUTEX_PRIO_PROTECT or UMUTEX_PRIO_INHERIT flag, respectively.

               Optionally, a timeout for the request may be specified.

               A  request with a timeout specified is not restartable.  An unblocked signal delivered during the
               wait always results in sleep interruption and EINTR error.  A request without  timeout  specified
               is always restarted after return from a signal handler.

       UMTX_OP_MUTEX_UNLOCK
               Unlock umutex.  The arguments to the request are:

               <u>obj</u>  Pointer to the umutex.

               Unlocks the mutex, by writing UMUTEX_UNOWNED (zero) value into m_owner word of the <u>struct</u> <u>umutex</u>.
               The write is done with a release barrier, to provide lock leave semantic.

               If  there are threads sleeping in the sleep queue associated with the umutex, one thread is woken
               up.  If more than one thread sleeps in the sleep queue, the UMUTEX_CONTESTED bit is set  together
               with the write of the UMUTEX_UNOWNED value into m_owner.

               The request adheres to the priority protection or inheritance protocol of the mutex, specified by
               the  UMUTEX_PRIO_PROTECT  or  UMUTEX_PRIO_INHERIT  flag,  respectively.   See  description of the
               m_ceilings member of the <u>struct</u> <u>umutex</u> structure for additional details of the request  operation
               on the priority protected protocol mutex.

       UMTX_OP_SET_CEILING
               Set ceiling for the priority protected umutex.  The arguments to the request are:

               <u>obj</u>    Pointer to the umutex.

               <u>val</u>    New ceiling value.

               <u>uaddr</u>  Address  of  a  variable of type <u>uint32_t</u>.  If not NULL and the update was successful, the
                      previous ceiling value is written to the location pointed to by <u>uaddr</u>.

               The request locks the umutex pointed to by the  <u>obj</u>  parameter,  waiting  for  the  lock  if  not
               immediately  available.   After the lock is obtained, the new ceiling value <u>val</u> is written to the
               m_ceilings[0] member of the <u>struct</u> <u>umutex,</u> after which the umutex is unlocked.

               The locking does  not  adhere  to  the  priority  protect  protocol,  to  conform  to  the  POSIX
               requirements for the <u><a href="../man3/pthread_mutex_setprioceiling.3.html">pthread_mutex_setprioceiling</a></u>(3) interface.

       UMTX_OP_CV_WAIT
               Wait for a condition.  The arguments to the request are:

               <u>obj</u>     Pointer to the <u>struct</u> <u>ucond</u>.

               <u>val</u>     Request flags, see below.

               <u>uaddr</u>   Pointer to the umutex.

               <u>uaddr2</u>  Optional pointer to a <u>struct</u> <u>timespec</u> for timeout specification.

               The  request must be issued by the thread owning the mutex pointed to by the <u>uaddr</u> argument.  The
               c_hash_waiters member of the <u>struct</u> <u>ucond</u>, pointed to by the <u>obj</u> argument, is set to an arbitrary
               non-zero value, after which the <u>uaddr</u> mutex is unlocked (following the appropriate protocol), and
               the current thread is put to sleep on the sleep queue keyed by the <u>obj</u> argument.  The  operations
               are  performed  atomically.   It  is  guaranteed  to  not miss a wakeup from UMTX_OP_CV_SIGNAL or
               UMTX_OP_CV_BROADCAST sent between mutex unlock and putting the current thread on the sleep queue.

               Upon wakeup, if the timeout expired and no other threads are sleeping in the  same  sleep  queue,
               the c_hash_waiters member is cleared.  After wakeup, the <u>uaddr</u> umutex is not relocked.

               The following flags are defined:

               CVWAIT_ABSTIME  Timeout is absolute.

               CVWAIT_CLOCKID  Clockid is provided.

               Optionally, a timeout for the request may be specified.  Unlike other requests, the timeout value
               is  specified  directly  by  a  <u>struct</u>  <u>timespec</u>,  pointed  to  by  the  <u>uaddr2</u> argument.  If the
               CVWAIT_CLOCKID flag is provided, the timeout uses the clock from  the  c_clockid  member  of  the
               <u>struct</u>  <u>ucond</u>,  pointed to by <u>obj</u> argument.  Otherwise, CLOCK_REALTIME is used, regardless of the
               clock identifier possibly specified in the <u>struct</u> <b>_</b><u>umtx_time</u>.   If  the  CVWAIT_ABSTIME  flag  is
               supplied,  the  timeout  specifies  absolute  time  value,  otherwise  it denotes a relative time
               interval.

               The request is not restartable.  An unblocked signal delivered during the wait always results  in
               sleep interruption and EINTR error.

       UMTX_OP_CV_SIGNAL
               Wake up one condition waiter.  The arguments to the request are:

               <u>obj</u>  Pointer to <u>struct</u> <u>ucond</u>.

               The  request  wakes  up at most one thread sleeping on the sleep queue keyed by the <u>obj</u> argument.
               If the woken up thread was the last on the sleep queue, the c_has_waiters member  of  the  <u>struct</u>
               <u>ucond</u> is cleared.

       UMTX_OP_CV_BROADCAST
               Wake up all condition waiters.  The arguments to the request are:

               <u>obj</u>  Pointer to <u>struct</u> <u>ucond</u>.

               The  request  wakes  up  all  threads sleeping on the sleep queue keyed by the <u>obj</u> argument.  The
               c_has_waiters member of the <u>struct</u> <u>ucond</u> is cleared.

       UMTX_OP_WAIT_UINT
               Same as UMTX_OP_WAIT, but the type of the variable pointed to by <u>obj</u> is <u>u_int</u> (a 32-bit integer).

       UMTX_OP_RW_RDLOCK
               Read-lock a <u>struct</u> <u>rwlock</u> lock.  The arguments to the request are:

               <u>obj</u>  Pointer to the lock (of type <u>struct</u> <u>rwlock</u>) to be read-locked.

               <u>val</u>  Additional flags to augment locking behaviour.  The valid flags in the <u>val</u> argument are:

                    URWLOCK_PREFER_READER

               The request obtains the read lock on the specified <u>struct</u> <u>rwlock</u> by  incrementing  the  count  of
               readers in the rw_state word of the structure.  If the URWLOCK_WRITE_OWNER bit is set in the word
               rw_state, the lock was granted to a writer which has not yet relinquished its ownership.  In this
               case the current thread is put to sleep until it makes sense to retry.

               If  the URWLOCK_PREFER_READER flag is set either in the rw_flags word of the structure, or in the
               <u>val</u> argument of the request, the presence of the threads trying to obtain the write lock  on  the
               same  structure  does  not  prevent  the  current  thread  from  trying  to obtain the read lock.
               Otherwise, if the flag is not set, and the URWLOCK_WRITE_WAITERS flag is  set  in  rw_state,  the
               current thread does not attempt to obtain read-lock.  Instead it sets the URWLOCK_READ_WAITERS in
               the  rw_state  word  and  puts  itself  to  sleep on corresponding sleep queue.  Upon wakeup, the
               locking conditions are re-evaluated.

               Optionally, a timeout for the request may be specified.

               The request is not restartable.  An unblocked signal delivered during the wait always results  in
               sleep interruption and EINTR error.

       UMTX_OP_RW_WRLOCK
               Write-lock a <u>struct</u> <u>rwlock</u> lock.  The arguments to the request are:

               <u>obj</u>  Pointer to the lock (of type <u>struct</u> <u>rwlock</u>) to be write-locked.

               The   request   obtains   a   write   lock  on  the  specified  <u>struct</u>  <u>rwlock</u>,  by  setting  the
               URWLOCK_WRITE_OWNER bit in the rw_state word of the structure.  If there is already a write  lock
               owner,  as  indicated by the URWLOCK_WRITE_OWNER bit being set, or there are read lock owners, as
               indicated by the read-lock counter, the current thread does not attempt to obtain the write-lock.
               Instead it sets the URWLOCK_WRITE_WAITERS in the rw_state  word  and  puts  itself  to  sleep  on
               corresponding sleep queue.  Upon wakeup, the locking conditions are re-evaluated.

               Optionally, a timeout for the request may be specified.

               The  request is not restartable.  An unblocked signal delivered during the wait always results in
               sleep interruption and EINTR error.

       UMTX_OP_RW_UNLOCK
               Unlock rwlock.  The arguments to the request are:

               <u>obj</u>  Pointer to the lock (of type <u>struct</u> <u>rwlock</u>) to be unlocked.

               The unlock type (read or write) is determined by the current lock state.  Note  that  the  <u>struct</u>
               <u>rwlock</u> does not save information about the identity of the thread which acquired the lock.

               If  there  are pending writers after the unlock, and the URWLOCK_PREFER_READER flag is not set in
               the rw_flags member of the <u>*obj</u> structure, one writer is woken up, selected as described  in  the
               “SLEEP  QUEUES”  subsection.  If the URWLOCK_PREFER_READER flag is set, a pending writer is woken
               up only if there is no pending readers.

               If there are no pending writers, or, in the case that the URWLOCK_PREFER_READER flag is set, then
               all pending readers are woken up by unlock.

       UMTX_OP_WAIT_UINT_PRIVATE
               Same as UMTX_OP_WAIT_UINT, but unconditionally select the process-private sleep queue.

       UMTX_OP_WAKE_PRIVATE
               Same as UMTX_OP_WAKE, but unconditionally select the process-private sleep queue.

       UMTX_OP_MUTEX_WAIT
               Wait for mutex availability.  The arguments to the request are:

               <u>obj</u>  Address of the mutex.

               Similarly to the UMTX_OP_MUTEX_LOCK, put the requesting thread to sleep if the mutex lock  cannot
               be  obtained  immediately.   The  UMUTEX_CONTESTED bit is set in the m_owner word of the mutex to
               indicate that there is a waiter, before the thread is added  to  the  sleep  queue.   Unlike  the
               UMTX_OP_MUTEX_LOCK request, the lock is not obtained.

               The operation is not implemented for priority protected and priority inherited protocol mutexes.

               Optionally, a timeout for the request may be specified.

               A  request with a timeout specified is not restartable.  An unblocked signal delivered during the
               wait always results in  sleep  interruption  and  EINTR  error.   A  request  without  a  timeout
               automatically  restarts  if  the  signal disposition requested restart via the SA_RESTART flag in
               <u>struct</u> <u>sigaction</u> member sa_flags.

       UMTX_OP_NWAKE_PRIVATE
               Wake up a batch of sleeping threads.  The arguments to the request are:

               <u>obj</u>  Pointer to the array of pointers.

               <u>val</u>  Number of elements in the array pointed to by <u>obj</u>.

               For each element in the array pointed to by <u>obj</u>, wakes up all  threads  waiting  on  the  <u>private</u>
               sleep queue with the key being the byte addressed by the array element.

       UMTX_OP_MUTEX_WAKE
               Check if a normal umutex is unlocked and wake up a waiter.  The arguments for the request are:

               <u>obj</u>  Pointer to the umutex.

               If  the  m_owner  word of the mutex pointed to by the <u>obj</u> argument indicates unowned mutex, which
               has its contention indicator bit UMUTEX_CONTESTED set, clear the bit and wake up  one  waiter  in
               the  sleep  queue associated with the byte addressed by the <u>obj</u>, if any.  Only normal mutexes are
               supported by the request.  The sleep queue is always one for a normal mutex type.

               This request is deprecated  in  favor  of  UMTX_OP_MUTEX_WAKE2  since  mutexes  using  it  cannot
               synchronize  their  own  destruction.   That  is,  the  m_owner  word  has  already  been  set to
               UMUTEX_UNOWNED when this request is made, so that another thread can lock, unlock and destroy the
               mutex (if no other thread uses the mutex afterwards).  Clearing the UMUTEX_CONTESTED bit may then
               modify freed memory.

       UMTX_OP_MUTEX_WAKE2
               Check if a umutex is unlocked and wake up a waiter.  The arguments for the request are:

               <u>obj</u>  Pointer to the umutex.

               <u>val</u>  The umutex flags.

               The request does not read the m_flags member of the <u>struct</u>  <u>umutex</u>;  instead,  the  <u>val</u>  argument
               supplies  flag  information,  in  particular,  to determine the sleep queue where the waiters are
               found for wake up.

               If the mutex is unowned, one waiter is woken up.

               If the mutex memory cannot be accessed, all waiters are woken up.

               If there is more than one waiter on the sleep queue, or there is only one waiter but the mutex is
               owned by a thread, the UMUTEX_CONTESTED bit is set in the m_owner word of the <u>struct</u> <u>umutex</u>.

       UMTX_OP_SEM2_WAIT
               Wait until semaphore is available.  The arguments to the request are:

               <u>obj</u>  Pointer to the semaphore (of type <u>struct</u> <b>_</b><u>usem2</u>).

               Put the requesting thread onto a sleep queue if the semaphore counter is zero.  If the thread  is
               put  to  sleep,  the  USEM_HAS_WAITERS  bit  is  set in the _count word to indicate waiters.  The
               function returns either due to _count indicating the semaphore is available (non-zero  count  due
               to post), or due to a wakeup.  The return does not guarantee that the semaphore is available, nor
               does it consume the semaphore lock on successful return.

               Optionally, a timeout for the request may be specified.

               A  request  with  non-absolute  timeout  value is not restartable.  An unblocked signal delivered
               during such wait results in sleep interruption and EINTR error.

       UMTX_OP_SEM2_WAKE
               Wake up waiters on semaphore lock.  The arguments to the request are:

               <u>obj</u>  Pointer to the semaphore (of type <u>struct</u> <b>_</b><u>usem2</u>).

               The request wakes up one waiter for the semaphore lock.  The  function  does  not  increment  the
               semaphore  lock  count.   If  the  USEM_HAS_WAITERS  bit was set in the _count word, and the last
               sleeping thread was woken up, the bit is cleared.

       UMTX_OP_SHM
               Manage anonymous POSIX shared memory objects (see <u><a href="../man2/shm_open.2.html">shm_open</a></u>(2)), which can be attached to  a  byte
               of  physical  memory,  mapped  into the process address space.  The objects are used to implement
               process-shared locks in libthr.

               The <u>val</u> argument specifies the sub-request of the UMTX_OP_SHM request:

               UMTX_SHM_CREAT
                       Creates the anonymous shared memory object, which can be looked up with the specified key
                       <u>uaddr.</u> If the object associated with the <u>uaddr</u> key already exists, it is returned instead
                       of creating a new object.   The  object's  size  is  one  page.   On  success,  the  file
                       descriptor  referencing  the  object is returned.  The descriptor can be used for mapping
                       the object using <u><a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a></u>(2), or for other shared memory operations.

               UMTX_SHM_LOOKUP
                       Same as UMTX_SHM_CREATE request, but if there is no shared memory object associated  with
                       the specified key <u>uaddr</u>, an error is returned, and no new object is created.

               UMTX_SHM_DESTROY
                       De-associate  the  shared  object  with  the specified key <u>uaddr.</u> The object is destroyed
                       after the last open file descriptor is closed and the last mapping for it is destroyed.

               UMTX_SHM_ALIVE
                       Checks whether there is a live shared object associated  with  the  supplied  key  <u>uaddr</u>.
                       Returns zero if there is, and an error otherwise.  This request is an optimization of the
                       UMTX_SHM_LOOKUP  request.   It is cheaper when only the liveness of the associated object
                       is asked for, since no file descriptor is installed in the process fd table on success.

               The <u>uaddr</u> argument specifies the virtual address, which backing physical memory byte identity  is
               used as a key for the anonymous shared object creation or lookup.

       UMTX_OP_ROBUST_LISTS
               Register  the  list  heads  for  the  current  thread's robust mutex lists.  The arguments to the
               request are:

               <u>val</u>    Size of the structure passed in the <u>uaddr</u> argument.

               <u>uaddr</u>  Pointer to the structure of type <u>struct</u> <u>umtx_robust_lists_params</u>.

               The structure is defined as

               struct umtx_robust_lists_params {
                       uintptr_t       robust_list_offset;
                       uintptr_t       robust_priv_list_offset;
                       uintptr_t       robust_inact_offset;
               };

               The robust_list_offset member contains address of the first element in the list of locked  robust
               shared  mutexes.  The robust_priv_list_offset member contains address of the first element in the
               list of locked robust private mutexes.  The private and shared robust locked lists are  split  to
               allow fast termination of the shared list on fork, in the child.

               The  robust_inact_offset  contains a pointer to the mutex which might be locked in nearby future,
               or might have been just unlocked.  It is typically set by the lock or unlock mutex implementation
               code around the whole operation, since lists can be only changed race-free when the  thread  owns
               the  mutex.   The  kernel  inspects the robust_inact_offset in addition to walking the shared and
               private lists.  Also, the mutex pointed to by robust_inact_offset is handled more loosely at  the
               thread  termination  time, than other mutexes on the list.  That mutex is allowed to be not owned
               by the current thread, in which  case  list  processing  is  continued.   See  “ROBUST  UMUTEXES”
               subsection for details.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       If  successful,  all  requests, except UMTX_SHM_CREAT and UMTX_SHM_LOOKUP sub-requests of the UMTX_OP_SHM
       request, will return zero.  The UMTX_SHM_CREAT and UMTX_SHM_LOOKUP return a shared memory file descriptor
       on success.  On error -1 is returned, and the <u>errno</u> variable is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>_umtx_op</b>() operations can fail with the following errors:

       [EFAULT]     One of the arguments point to invalid memory.

       [EINVAL]     The clock identifier, specified for the <u>struct</u>  <b>_</b><u>umtx_time</u>  timeout  parameter,  or  in  the
                    c_clockid member of <u>struct</u> <u>ucond,</u> is invalid.

       [EINVAL]     The type of the mutex, encoded by the m_flags member of <u>struct</u> <u>umutex</u>, is invalid.

       [EINVAL]     The  m_owner member of the <u>struct</u> <u>umutex</u> has changed the lock owner thread identifier during
                    unlock.

       [EINVAL]     The timeout.tv_sec or timeout.tv_nsec member of <u>struct</u> <b>_</b><u>umtx_time</u>  is  less  than  zero,  or
                    timeout.tv_nsec is greater than 1000000000.

       [EINVAL]     The <u>op</u> argument specifies invalid operation.

       [EINVAL]     The <u>uaddr</u> argument for the UMTX_OP_SHM request specifies invalid operation.

       [EINVAL]     The UMTX_OP_SET_CEILING request specifies non priority protected mutex.

       [EINVAL]     The new ceiling value for the UMTX_OP_SET_CEILING request, or one or more of the values read
                    from the m_ceilings array during lock or unlock operations, is greater than RTP_PRIO_MAX.

       [EPERM]      Unlock attempted on an object not owned by the current thread.

       [EOWNERDEAD]
                    The   lock   was   requested   on  an  umutex  where  the  m_owner  field  was  set  to  the
                    UMUTEX_RB_OWNERDEAD value, indicating terminated robust mutex.  The lock was granted to  the
                    caller, so this error in fact indicates success with additional conditions.

       [ENOTRECOVERABLE]
                    The  lock  was requested on an umutex which m_owner field is equal to the UMUTEX_RB_NOTRECOV
                    value, indicating abandoned robust mutex after termination.  The lock was not granted to the
                    caller.

       [ENOTTY]     The shared memory object, associated with the address  passed  to  the  UMTX_SHM_ALIVE  sub-
                    request of UMTX_OP_SHM request, was destroyed.

       [ESRCH]      For   the   UMTX_SHM_LOOKUP,   UMTX_SHM_DESTROY,  and  UMTX_SHM_ALIVE  sub-requests  of  the
                    UMTX_OP_SHM request, there is no shared memory object associated with the provided key.

       [ENOMEM]     The UMTX_SHM_CREAT sub-request of the  UMTX_OP_SHM  request  cannot  be  satisfied,  because
                    allocation  of  the  shared  memory object would exceed the RLIMIT_UMTXP resource limit, see
                    <u><a href="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</a></u>(2).

       [EAGAIN]     The maximum number of readers (URWLOCK_MAX_READERS) were already granted  ownership  of  the
                    given <u>struct</u> <u>rwlock</u> for read.

       [EBUSY]      A try mutex lock operation was not able to obtain the lock.

       [ETIMEDOUT]  The  request  specified  a  timeout  in the <u>uaddr</u> and <u>uaddr2</u> arguments, and timed out before
                    obtaining the lock or being woken up.

       [EINTR]      A signal was delivered during  wait,  for  a  non-restartable  operation.   Operations  with
                    timeouts  are  typically  non-restartable,  but  timeouts  specified in absolute time may be
                    restartable.

       [ERESTART]   A signal was delivered during wait,  for  a  restartable  operation.   Mutex  lock  requests
                    without  timeout  specified  are  restartable.   The error is not returned to userspace code
                    since restart is handled by usual adjustment of the instruction counter.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>_umtx_op</b>()  system  call is non-standard and is used by the 1:1 Threading Library (libthr, -lthr) to
       implement IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”) <u><a href="../man3/pthread.3.html">pthread</a></u>(3) functionality.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       A window between a unlocking robust mutex and resetting the pointer in the robust_inact_offset member  of
       the  registered  <u>struct</u>  <u>umtx_robust_lists_params</u> allows another thread to destroy the mutex, thus making
       the kernel inspect freed or reused memory.  The <b>libthr</b> implementation is only  vulnerable  to  this  race
       when  operating  on  a  shared mutex.  A possible fix for the current implementation is to strengthen the
       checks for shared mutexes before terminating them, in particular, verifying  that  the  mutex  memory  is
       mapped  from a shared memory object allocated by the UMTX_OP_SHM request.  This is not done because it is
       believed that the race is adequately covered by other consistency checks, while adding  the  check  would
       prevent alternative implementations of <b>libpthread</b>.
