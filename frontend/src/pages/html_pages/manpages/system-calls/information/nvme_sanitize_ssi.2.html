</pre><h4><b>Constants</b></h4><pre>
       NVME_SANITIZE_SSI_SANS_SHIFT
                   Shift amount to get the value of Sanitize State from Sanitize State Information (SSI) field.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSI_SANS_MASK
                   Mask to get the value of Sanitize State from Sanitize State Information (SSI) field.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSI_FAILS_SHIFT
                   Shift amount to get the value of Failure State from Sanitize State Information (SSI) field.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSI_FAILS_MASK
                   Mask to get the value of Failure State from Sanitize State Information (SSI) field.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSI_IDLE
                   No sanitize operation is in process.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSI_RESTRICT_PROCESSING
                   The Sanitize operation is in Restricted Processing State.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSI_RESTRICT_FAILURE
                   The  Sanitize  operation  is  in  Restricted Failure State. This state is entered if sanitize
                   processing was performed in the Restricted Processing state and sanitize processing failed or
                   a failure occurred during deallocation  of  media  allocated  for  user  data  in  the  Post-
                   Verification Deallocation state.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSI_UNRESTRICT_PROCESSING
                   The Sanitize operation is in Unrestricted Processing State.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSI_UNRESTRICT_FAILURE
                   The  Sanitize  operation  is in Unrestricted Failure State. This state is entered if sanitize
                   processing was performed in the Unrestricted Processing state and sanitize processing  failed
                   or  a  failure  occurred  during  deallocation  of media allocated for user data in the Post-
                   Verification.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSI_MEDIA_VERIFICATION
                   The Sanitize operation is in Media Verification State. In this state, the sanitize processing
                   completed successfully, and all media allocated for user data in the sanitization  target  is
                   readable by the host for purposes of verifying sanitization.

       NVME_SANITIZE_SSI_POST_VERIF_DEALLOC
                   The  Sanitize  operation  is  in  Post-Verification  Deallocation  State.  In this state, the
                   controller shall deallocate all media allocated for user data in the sanitization target.
