</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       new-hash -  (hash)

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       Create hash.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
           new-hash &lt;hash&gt; \
               [ process-scope ] \
               [ hash-size &lt;hash size&gt; ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       new-hash  creates new &lt;hash&gt;. A hash is a collection of key/value pairs, called "elements". A value of an
       element is obtained based on its key value.

       <b>SCOPE</b>

       Note that a hash is accessible to the current request only, unless "process-scope"  clause  is  used,  in
       which  case  all  requests served by a process can use it (see <b>do-once</b> for a typical way to create a hash
       with a process scope).

       If "process-scope" is used, then &lt;hash&gt; will keep its data across all requests in a  given  process.  See
       <b>write-hash</b> for an example of a process-scoped hash.

       <b>SIZING</b> <b>A</b> <b>HASH</b>

       A  hash  can be of any size, as long as there is enough memory for it. The "hash-size" refers to the size
       of a hash table used to provide high-performance access to its elements based on a key.

       &lt;hash size&gt; is the number of "buckets" used by the hash (it is 10 by default). All hash elements with the
       same hash code are stored in a linked list within the same bucket. Greater &lt;hash  size&gt;  generally  means
       less elements per bucket and better performance. However, memory usage grows with a bigger hash table, so
       &lt;hash size&gt; should be balanced based on the program needs.

       Golf uses high-performing <b>FNV1_a</b> hash algorithm. Each element in a bucket list is lightweight, containing
       pointers to a key, value and next element in the linked list.

       &lt;hash size&gt; must be at least 256; if less, it will be set to 256.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Create a new hash with 5000 buckets:

           new-hash h hash-size 5000

       See <b>read-hash</b> for more examples.
