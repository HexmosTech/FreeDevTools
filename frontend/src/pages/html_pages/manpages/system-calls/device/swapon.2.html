</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       swapon, swapoff - start/stop swapping to file/device

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C library (<u>libc</u>, <u>-lc</u>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/swap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>swapon(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>path</u><b>,</b> <b>int</b> <u>swapflags</u><b>);</b>
       <b>int</b> <b>swapoff(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>path</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>swapon</b>()  sets  the swap area to the file or block device specified by <u>path</u>.  <b>swapoff</b>() stops swapping to
       the file or block device specified by <u>path</u>.

       If the <b>SWAP_FLAG_PREFER</b> flag is specified in the <b>swapon</b>() <u>swapflags</u> argument, the new swap area will have
       a higher priority than default.  The priority is encoded within <u>swapflags</u> as:

           <u>(prio</u> <u>&lt;&lt;</u> <u>SWAP_FLAG_PRIO_SHIFT)</u> <u>&amp;</u> <u>SWAP_FLAG_PRIO_MASK</u>

       If the <b>SWAP_FLAG_DISCARD</b> flag is specified in the <b>swapon</b>() <u>swapflags</u> argument, freed swap pages  will  be
       discarded  before  they are reused, if the swap device supports the discard or trim operation.  (This may
       improve performance on some Solid State Devices, but often it does not.)  See also NOTES.

       These functions may be used only by a privileged process (one having the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability).

   <b>Priority</b>
       Each swap area has a priority, either high or low.  The default priority is low.  Within the low-priority
       areas, newer areas are even lower priority than older areas.

       All priorities set with <u>swapflags</u> are high-priority, higher than default.  They may have any  nonnegative
       value chosen by the caller.  Higher numbers mean higher priority.

       Swap  pages are allocated from areas in priority order, highest priority first.  For areas with different
       priorities, a higher-priority area is exhausted before using a lower-priority area.  If two or more areas
       have the same priority, and it is the highest priority available, pages are allocated  on  a  round-robin
       basis between them.

       As of Linux 1.3.6, the kernel usually follows these rules, but there are exceptions.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>EBUSY</b>  (for <b>swapon</b>()) The specified <u>path</u> is already being used as a swap area.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The file <u>path</u> exists, but refers neither to a regular file nor to a block device;

       <b>EINVAL</b> (<b>swapon</b>())  The  indicated path does not contain a valid swap signature or resides on an in-memory
              filesystem such as <b><a href="../man5/tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs</a></b>(5).

       <b>EINVAL</b> (since Linux 3.4)
              (<b>swapon</b>()) An invalid flag value was specified in <u>swapflags</u>.

       <b>EINVAL</b> (<b>swapoff</b>()) <u>path</u> is not currently a swap area.

       <b>ENFILE</b> The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       <b>ENOENT</b> The file <u>path</u> does not exist.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> The system has insufficient memory to start swapping.

       <b>EPERM</b>  The caller does not have the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability.  Alternatively, the maximum number of  swap
              files are already in use; see NOTES below.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       Linux.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>swapflags</u> argument was introduced in Linux 1.3.2.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The partition or path must be prepared with <b><a href="../man8/mkswap.8.html">mkswap</a></b>(8).

       There  is  an  upper  limit  on the number of swap files that may be used, defined by the kernel constant
       <b>MAX_SWAPFILES</b>.  Before Linux 2.4.10, <b>MAX_SWAPFILES</b> has the value 8; since Linux 2.4.10, it has the  value
       32.   Since Linux 2.6.18, the limit is decreased by 2 (thus 30), since Linux 5.19, the limit is decreased
       by 3 (thus: 29) if the kernel is built with the <b>CONFIG_MIGRATION</b> option (which reserves  two  swap  table
       entries for the page migration features of <b><a href="../man2/mbind.2.html">mbind</a></b>(2) and <b><a href="../man2/migrate_pages.2.html">migrate_pages</a></b>(2)).  Since Linux 2.6.32, the limit
       is  further  decreased  by  1  if the kernel is built with the <b>CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE</b> option.  Since Linux
       5.14, the limit is further decreased by 4 if the kernel is built with the  <b>CONFIG_DEVICE_PRIVATE</b>  option.
       Since  Linux  5.19, the limit is further decreased by 1 if the kernel is built with the <b>CONFIG_PTE_MARKER</b>
       option.

       Discard of swap pages was introduced in Linux 2.6.29, then made conditional on the <b>SWAP_FLAG_DISCARD</b> flag
       in Linux 2.6.36, which still discards the entire swap area when <b>swapon</b>() is called, even if that flag bit
       is not set.
