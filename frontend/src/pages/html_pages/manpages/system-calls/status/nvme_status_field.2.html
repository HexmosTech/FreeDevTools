       NVME_SC_CMB_INVALID_USE
                   Invalid Use of Controller Memory Buffer: The attempted use of the Controller Memory Buffer is
                   not supported by the controller.

                   PRP Offset Invalid: The Offset field for a PRP entry is invalid.

       NVME_SC_AWU_EXCEEDED
                   Atomic Write Unit Exceeded: The length specified exceeds the atomic write unit size.

       NVME_SC_OP_DENIED
                   Operation Denied: The command was  denied  due  to  lack  of  access  rights.  Refer  to  the
                   appropriate security specification.

       NVME_SC_SGL_INVALID_OFFSET
                   SGL  Offset  Invalid:  The  offset  specified in a descriptor is invalid. This may occur when
                   using capsules for data transfers in NVMe over Fabrics implementations and an invalid  offset
                   in the capsule is specified.

       NVME_SC_HOSTID_FORMAT
                   Host  Identifier  Inconsistent Format: The NVM subsystem detected the simultaneous use of 64-
                   bit and 128-bit Host Identifier values on different controllers.

       NVME_SC_KAT_EXPIRED
                   Keep Alive Timer Expired: The Keep Alive Timer expired.

       NVME_SC_KAT_INVALID
                   Keep Alive Timeout Invalid: The Keep Alive Timeout value specified is invalid.

       NVME_SC_CMD_ABORTED_PREMEPT
                   Command Aborted due to Preempt and Abort: The  command  was  aborted  due  to  a  Reservation

       NVME_SC_SANITIZE_IN_PROGRESS
                   Sanitize In Progress: The requested function (e.g., command) is prohibited while  a  sanitize
                   operation is in progress.

       NVME_SC_SGL_INVALID_GRANULARITY
                   SGL  Data  Block  Granularity Invalid: The Address alignment or Length granularity for an SGL
                   Data Block descriptor is invalid.

       NVME_SC_CMD_IN_CMBQ_NOT_SUPP
                   Command Not Supported for Queue in CMB: The implementation does not support submission of the
                   command to a Submission Queue in the Controller Memory Buffer  or  command  completion  to  a
                   Completion Queue in the Controller Memory Buffer.

       NVME_SC_NS_WRITE_PROTECTED
                   Namespace  is  Write  Protected:  The  command  is  prohibited  while  the namespace is write
                   protected as a result of a change in the namespace write protection state as defined  by  the
                   Namespace Write Protection State Machine.

       NVME_SC_CMD_INTERRUPTED
                   Command  Interrupted:  Command  processing  was  interrupted  and the controller is unable to

       NVME_SC_TRAN_TPORT_ERROR
                   Transient Transport Error: A transient transport  error  was  detected.  If  the  command  is
                   retried on the same controller, the command is likely to succeed. A command that fails with a
                   transient  transport  error  four  or  more times should be treated as a persistent transport
                   error that is not likely to succeed if retried on the same controller.

       NVME_SC_PROHIBITED_BY_CMD_AND_FEAT
