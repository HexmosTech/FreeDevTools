</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mount - mount filesystem

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C library (<u>libc</u>, <u>-lc</u>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/mount.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>mount(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>source</u><b>,</b> <b>const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>target</u><b>,</b>
                 <b>const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>filesystemtype</u><b>,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>long</b> <u>mountflags</u><b>,</b>
                 <b>const</b> <b>void</b> <b>*_Nullable</b> <u>data</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mount</b>() attaches the filesystem specified by <u>source</u> (which is often a pathname referring to a device, but
       can also be the pathname of a directory or file, or a dummy string) to the location (a directory or file)
       specified by the pathname in <u>target</u>.

       Appropriate privilege (Linux: the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability) is required to mount filesystems.

       Values  for  the  <u>filesystemtype</u>  argument supported by the kernel are listed in <u><a href="file:/proc/filesystems">/proc/filesystems</a></u> (e.g.,
       "btrfs", "ext4", "jfs", "xfs", "vfat",  "fuse",  "tmpfs",  "cgroup",  "proc",  "mqueue",  "nfs",  "cifs",
       "iso9660").  Further types may become available when the appropriate modules are loaded.

       The  <u>data</u>  argument  is  interpreted  by  the  different filesystems.  Typically it is a string of comma-
       separated options understood by this filesystem.  See <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8) for details of the options  available  for
       each filesystem type.  This argument may be specified as NULL, if there are no options.

       A call to <b>mount</b>() performs one of a number of general types of operation, depending on the bits specified
       in  <u>mountflags</u>.   The  choice  of  which  operation  to  perform is determined by testing the bits set in
       <u>mountflags</u>, with the tests being conducted in the order listed here:

       •  Remount an existing mount: <u>mountflags</u> includes <b>MS_REMOUNT</b>.

       •  Create a bind mount: <u>mountflags</u> includes <b>MS_BIND</b>.

       •  Change the propagation type of an existing mount: <u>mountflags</u> includes one  of  <b>MS_SHARED</b>,  <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>,
          <b>MS_SLAVE</b>, or <b>MS_UNBINDABLE</b>.

       •  Move an existing mount to a new location: <u>mountflags</u> includes <b>MS_MOVE</b>.

       •  Create a new mount: <u>mountflags</u> includes none of the above flags.

       Each of these operations is detailed later in this page.  Further flags may be specified in <u>mountflags</u> to
       modify the behavior of <b>mount</b>(), as described below.

   <b>Additional</b> <b>mount</b> <b>flags</b>
       The  list  below  describes  the  additional  flags  that can be specified in <u>mountflags</u>.  Note that some
       operation types ignore some or all of these flags, as described later in this page.

       <b>MS_DIRSYNC</b> (since Linux 2.5.19)
              Make directory changes on this  filesystem  synchronous.   (This  property  can  be  obtained  for
              individual directories or subtrees using <b><a href="../man1/chattr.1.html">chattr</a></b>(1).)

       <b>MS_LAZYTIME</b> (since Linux 4.0)
              Reduce on-disk updates of inode timestamps (atime, mtime, ctime) by maintaining these changes only
              in memory.  The on-disk timestamps are updated only when:

              •  the inode needs to be updated for some change unrelated to file timestamps;

              •  the application employs <b><a href="../man2/fsync.2.html">fsync</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/syncfs.2.html">syncfs</a></b>(2), or <b><a href="../man2/sync.2.html">sync</a></b>(2);

              •  an undeleted inode is evicted from memory; or

              •  more than 24 hours have passed since the inode was written to disk.

              This mount option significantly reduces writes needed to update the inode's timestamps, especially
              mtime  and  atime.   However,  in  the event of a system crash, the atime and mtime fields on disk
              might be out of date by up to 24 hours.

              Examples of workloads where this option could be of significant benefit  include  frequent  random
              writes  to  preallocated  files,  as  well  as cases where the <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b> mount option is also
              enabled.  (The advantage of combining <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b> and <b>MS_LAZYTIME</b> is that <b><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></b>(2)  will  return
              the  correctly  updated  atime,  but  the  atime updates will be flushed to disk only in the cases
              listed above.)

       <b>MS_MANDLOCK</b>
              Permit mandatory locking on files in this filesystem.  (Mandatory locking must still be enabled on
              a per-file basis, as described in <b><a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</a></b>(2).)  Since Linux 4.5,  this  mount  option  requires  the
              <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>  capability  and  a kernel configured with the <b>CONFIG_MANDATORY_FILE_LOCKING</b> option.
              Mandatory locking has been fully deprecated in Linux 5.15,  so  this  flag  should  be  considered
              deprecated.

       <b>MS_NOATIME</b>
              Do not update access times for (all types of) files on this filesystem.

       <b>MS_NODEV</b>
              Do not allow access to devices (special files) on this filesystem.

       <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>
              Do not update access times for directories on this filesystem.  This flag provides a subset of the
              functionality provided by <b>MS_NOATIME</b>; that is, <b>MS_NOATIME</b> implies <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>.

       <b>MS_NOEXEC</b>
              Do not allow programs to be executed from this filesystem.

       <b>MS_NOSUID</b>
              Do  not  honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits or file capabilities when executing programs from
              this   filesystem.    In   addition,   SELinux   domain   transitions   require   the   permission
              <u>nosuid_transition</u>, which in turn needs also the policy capability <u>nnp_nosuid_transition</u>.

       <b>MS_RDONLY</b>
              Mount filesystem read-only.

       <b>MS_REC</b> (since Linux 2.4.11)
              Used  in  conjunction  with  <b>MS_BIND</b> to create a recursive bind mount, and in conjunction with the
              propagation type flags to recursively change the propagation type  of  all  of  the  mounts  in  a
              subtree.  See below for further details.

       <b>MS_RELATIME</b> (since Linux 2.6.20)
              When a file on this filesystem is accessed, update the file's last access time (atime) only if the
              current  value of atime is less than or equal to the file's last modification time (mtime) or last
              status change time (ctime).  This option is useful for programs, such as  <b><a href="../man1/mutt.1.html">mutt</a></b>(1),  that  need  to
              know  when  a  file  has  been  read  since  it was last modified.  Since Linux 2.6.30, the kernel
              defaults to the behavior provided  by  this  flag  (unless  <b>MS_NOATIME</b>  was  specified),  and  the
              <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b> flag is required to obtain traditional semantics.  In addition, since Linux 2.6.30,
              the file's last access time is always updated if it is more than 1 day old.

       <b>MS_SILENT</b> (since Linux 2.6.17)
              Suppress  the  display  of  certain  (<u>printk</u>())  warning  messages  in  the kernel log.  This flag
              supersedes the misnamed and obsolete <b>MS_VERBOSE</b> flag (available since Linux 2.4.12), which has the
              same meaning.

       <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b> (since Linux 2.6.30)
              Always update the last access time (atime) when files on this filesystem are accessed.  (This  was
              the  default  behavior before Linux 2.6.30.)  Specifying this flag overrides the effect of setting
              the <b>MS_NOATIME</b> and <b>MS_RELATIME</b> flags.

       <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b>
              Make writes on this filesystem synchronous (as though the <b>O_SYNC</b> flag to <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2) was specified for
              all file opens to this filesystem).

       <b>MS_NOSYMFOLLOW</b> (since Linux 5.10)
              Do not follow symbolic links when resolving paths.  Symbolic  links  can  still  be  created,  and
              <b><a href="../man1/readlink.1.html">readlink</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man1/realpath.1.html">realpath</a></b>(1), and <b><a href="../man3/realpath.3.html">realpath</a></b>(3) all still work properly.

       From  Linux  2.4 onward, some of the above flags are settable on a per-mount basis, while others apply to
       the superblock of the mounted filesystem, meaning that all mounts of  the  same  filesystem  share  those
       flags.  (Previously, all of the flags were per-superblock.)

       The per-mount-point flags are as follows:

       •  Since Linux 2.4: <b>MS_NODEV</b>, <b>MS_NOEXEC</b>, and <b>MS_NOSUID</b> flags are settable on a per-mount-point basis.

       •  Additionally, since Linux 2.6.16: <b>MS_NOATIME</b> and <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>.

       •  Additionally, since Linux 2.6.20: <b>MS_RELATIME</b>.

       The   following   flags   are   per-superblock:  <b>MS_DIRSYNC</b>,  <b>MS_LAZYTIME</b>,  <b>MS_MANDLOCK</b>,  <b>MS_SILENT</b>,  and
       <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b>.  The initial settings of these flags are determined on the first mount of the filesystem,
       and will be shared by all subsequent mounts of the same filesystem.  Subsequently, the  settings  of  the
       flags  can  be  changed via a remount operation (see below).  Such changes will be visible via all mounts
       associated with the filesystem.

       Since Linux 2.6.16, <b>MS_RDONLY</b> can be set or cleared  on  a  per-mount-point  basis  as  well  as  on  the
       underlying filesystem superblock.  The mounted filesystem will be writable only if neither the filesystem
       nor the mountpoint are flagged as read-only.

   <b>Remounting</b> <b>an</b> <b>existing</b> <b>mount</b>
       An existing mount may be remounted by specifying <b>MS_REMOUNT</b> in <u>mountflags</u>.  This allows you to change the
       <u>mountflags</u>  and  <u>data</u>  of an existing mount without having to unmount and remount the filesystem.  <u>target</u>
       should be the same value specified in the initial <b>mount</b>() call.

       The <u>source</u> and <u>filesystemtype</u> arguments are ignored.

       The <u>mountflags</u> and <u>data</u> arguments should match the values used in the original <b>mount</b>() call,  except  for
       those parameters that are being deliberately changed.

       The  following  <u>mountflags</u> can be changed: <b>MS_LAZYTIME</b>, <b>MS_MANDLOCK</b>, <b>MS_NOATIME</b>, <b>MS_NODEV</b>, <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>,
       <b>MS_NOEXEC</b>, <b>MS_NOSUID</b>, <b>MS_RELATIME</b>, <b>MS_RDONLY</b>, <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b> (whose effect is to clear the <b>MS_NOATIME</b> and
       <b>MS_RELATIME</b> flags), and <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b>.  Attempts to change the setting of the <b>MS_DIRSYNC</b>  and  <b>MS_SILENT</b>
       flags  during  a remount are silently ignored.  Note that changes to per-superblock flags are visible via
       all mounts of the associated filesystem (because the per-superblock flags are shared by all mounts).

       Since Linux 3.17, if none of <b>MS_NOATIME</b>, <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>, <b>MS_RELATIME</b>, or <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b>  is  specified  in
       <u>mountflags</u>,  then  the  remount  operation  preserves  the  existing  values  of these flags (rather than
       defaulting to <b>MS_RELATIME</b>).

       Since Linux 2.6.26, the <b>MS_REMOUNT</b> flag can be used with  <b>MS_BIND</b>  to  modify  only  the  per-mount-point
       flags.   This  is  particularly  useful  for  setting or clearing the "read-only" flag on a mount without
       changing the underlying filesystem.  Specifying <u>mountflags</u> as:

           MS_REMOUNT | MS_BIND | MS_RDONLY

       will make access through this mountpoint read-only, without affecting other mounts.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>bind</b> <b>mount</b>
       If <u>mountflags</u> includes <b>MS_BIND</b> (available since Linux 2.4), then perform a  bind  mount.   A  bind  mount
       makes a file or a directory subtree visible at another point within the single directory hierarchy.  Bind
       mounts may cross filesystem boundaries and span <b><a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</a></b>(2) jails.

       The <u>filesystemtype</u> and <u>data</u> arguments are ignored.

       The  remaining  bits  (other  than  <b>MS_REC</b>, described below) in the <u>mountflags</u> argument are also ignored.
       (The bind mount has the same mount options as the underlying mount.)   However,  see  the  discussion  of
       remounting above, for a method of making an existing bind mount read-only.

       By  default, when a directory is bind mounted, only that directory is mounted; if there are any submounts
       under the directory tree, they are not bind mounted.  If the  <b>MS_REC</b>  flag  is  also  specified,  then  a
       recursive  bind  mount  operation  is  performed:  all  submounts  under  the  <u>source</u> subtree (other than
       unbindable mounts) are also bind mounted at the corresponding location in the <u>target</u> subtree.

   <b>Changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>propagation</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>existing</b> <b>mount</b>
       If <u>mountflags</u> includes one of <b>MS_SHARED</b>, <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>, <b>MS_SLAVE</b>,  or  <b>MS_UNBINDABLE</b>  (all  available  since
       Linux  2.6.15),  then  the  propagation  type of an existing mount is changed.  If more than one of these
       flags is specified, an error results.

       The only other flags that can be specified while changing the  propagation  type  are  <b>MS_REC</b>  (described
       below) and <b>MS_SILENT</b> (which is ignored).

       The <u>source</u>, <u>filesystemtype</u>, and <u>data</u> arguments are ignored.

       The meanings of the propagation type flags are as follows:

       <b>MS_SHARED</b>
              Make  this  mount shared.  Mount and unmount events immediately under this mount will propagate to
              the other mounts that are members of this mount's peer group.  Propagation  here  means  that  the
              same  mount  or  unmount will automatically occur under all of the other mounts in the peer group.
              Conversely, mount and unmount events that take place under peer  mounts  will  propagate  to  this
              mount.

       <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>
              Make this mount private.  Mount and unmount events do not propagate into or out of this mount.

       <b>MS_SLAVE</b>
              If this is a shared mount that is a member of a peer group that contains other members, convert it
              to  a  slave  mount.   If this is a shared mount that is a member of a peer group that contains no
              other members, convert it to a private mount.  Otherwise, the propagation type  of  the  mount  is
              left unchanged.

              When  a  mount  is  a  slave, mount and unmount events propagate into this mount from the (master)
              shared peer group of which it was formerly a member.  Mount and unmount events under this mount do
              not propagate to any peer.

              A mount can be the slave of another peer group while at the same time sharing  mount  and  unmount
              events with a peer group of which it is a member.

       <b>MS_UNBINDABLE</b>
              Make  this  mount  unbindable.   This is like a private mount, and in addition this mount can't be
              bind mounted.  When a recursive bind  mount  (<b>mount</b>()  with  the  <b>MS_BIND</b>  and  <b>MS_REC</b>  flags)  is
              performed  on  a  directory  subtree,  any  unbindable mounts within the subtree are automatically
              pruned (i.e., not replicated) when replicating that subtree to produce the target subtree.

       By default, changing the propagation type affects only the <u>target</u> mount.  If  the  <b>MS_REC</b>  flag  is  also
       specified in <u>mountflags</u>, then the propagation type of all mounts under <u>target</u> is also changed.

       For further details regarding mount propagation types (including the default propagation type assigned to
       new mounts), see <b><a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces</a></b>(7).

   <b>Moving</b> <b>a</b> <b>mount</b>
       If  <u>mountflags</u>  contains  the  flag  <b>MS_MOVE</b>  (available since Linux 2.4.18), then move a subtree: <u>source</u>
       specifies an existing mount and <u>target</u> specifies the new location to which that mount is to be relocated.
       The move is atomic: at no point is the subtree unmounted.

       The remaining bits in the <u>mountflags</u> argument are ignored, as are the <u>filesystemtype</u> and <u>data</u> arguments.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>mount</b>
       If none of <b>MS_REMOUNT</b>, <b>MS_BIND</b>, <b>MS_MOVE</b>, <b>MS_SHARED</b>, <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>, <b>MS_SLAVE</b>, or <b>MS_UNBINDABLE</b>  is  specified
       in  <u>mountflags</u>,  then  <b>mount</b>()  performs  its default action: creating a new mount.  <u>source</u> specifies the
       source for the new mount, and <u>target</u> specifies the directory at which to create the mount point.

       The <u>filesystemtype</u> and <u>data</u> arguments are employed, and further bits may be specified  in  <u>mountflags</u>  to
       modify the behavior of the call.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The  error  values  given below result from filesystem type independent errors.  Each filesystem type may
       have its own special errors and its own special behavior.  See the Linux kernel source code for details.

       <b>EACCES</b> A component of a path was not searchable.  (See also <b><a href="../man7/path_resolution.7.html">path_resolution</a></b>(7).)

       <b>EACCES</b> Mounting a read-only filesystem was attempted without giving the <b>MS_RDONLY</b> flag.

              The filesystem may be read-only for various reasons, including: it resides on a read-only  optical
              disk;  it is resides on a device with a physical switch that has been set to mark the device read-
              only; the filesystem implementation was compiled with read-only support; or errors  were  detected
              when  initially mounting the filesystem, so that it was marked read-only and can't be remounted as
              read-write (until the errors are fixed).

              Some filesystems instead return the error <b>EROFS</b> on an attempt to mount a read-only filesystem.

       <b>EACCES</b> The block device <u>source</u> is located on a filesystem mounted with the <b>MS_NODEV</b> option.

       <b>EBUSY</b>  An attempt was made to stack a new mount directly on top of  an  existing  mount  point  that  was
              created in this mount namespace with the same <u>source</u> and <u>target</u>.

       <b>EBUSY</b>  <u>source</u> cannot be remounted read-only, because it still holds files open for writing.

       <b>EFAULT</b> One of the pointer arguments points outside the user address space.

       <b>EINVAL</b> <u>source</u> had an invalid superblock.

       <b>EINVAL</b> A remount operation (<b>MS_REMOUNT</b>) was attempted, but <u>source</u> was not already mounted on <u>target</u>.

       <b>EINVAL</b> A  move  operation  (<b>MS_MOVE</b>)  was  attempted, but the mount tree under <u>source</u> includes unbindable
              mounts and <u>target</u> is a mount that has propagation type <b>MS_SHARED</b>.

       <b>EINVAL</b> A move operation (<b>MS_MOVE</b>) was attempted, but the parent mount of  <u>source</u>  mount  has  propagation
              type <b>MS_SHARED</b>.

       <b>EINVAL</b> A move operation (<b>MS_MOVE</b>) was attempted, but <u>source</u> was not a mount, or was '/'.

       <b>EINVAL</b> A bind operation (<b>MS_BIND</b>) was requested where <u>source</u> referred a mount namespace magic link (i.e.,
              a  <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/ns/mnt</u>  magic  link  or  a bind mount to such a link) and the propagation type of the
              parent mount of <u>target</u> was <b>MS_SHARED</b>, but propagation of the requested bind mount could lead to  a
              circular dependency that might prevent the mount namespace from ever being freed.

       <b>EINVAL</b> <u>mountflags</u> includes more than one of <b>MS_SHARED</b>, <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>, <b>MS_SLAVE</b>, or <b>MS_UNBINDABLE</b>.

       <b>EINVAL</b> <u>mountflags</u>  includes  <b>MS_SHARED</b>,  <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>,  <b>MS_SLAVE</b>, or <b>MS_UNBINDABLE</b> and also includes a flag
              other than <b>MS_REC</b> or <b>MS_SILENT</b>.

       <b>EINVAL</b> An attempt was made to bind mount an unbindable mount.

       <b>EINVAL</b> In an unprivileged mount namespace (i.e., a mount namespace owned by a  user  namespace  that  was
              created  by  an  unprivileged  user),  a  bind  mount  operation  (<b>MS_BIND</b>)  was attempted without
              specifying (<b>MS_REC</b>), which would have revealed the filesystem tree underneath one of the submounts

       <b>ELOOP</b>  Too many links encountered during pathname resolution.

       <b>ELOOP</b>  A move operation was attempted, and <u>target</u> is a descendant of <u>source</u>.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              A pathname was longer than <b>MAXPATHLEN</b>.

              <u>source</u> is not a block device (and a device was required).

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>

       <b>EPERM</b>  The caller does not have the required privileges.

       <b>EPERM</b>  An attempt was made to modify (<b>MS_REMOUNT</b>) the <b>MS_RDONLY</b>, <b>MS_NOSUID</b>, or <b>MS_NOEXEC</b> flag, or one  of
              the  "atime" flags (<b>MS_NOATIME</b>, <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>, <b>MS_RELATIME</b>) of an existing mount, but the mount is
              locked; see <b><a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces</a></b>(7).

       <b>EROFS</b>  Mounting a read-only filesystem was attempted without giving  the  <b>MS_RDONLY</b>  flag.   See  <b>EACCES</b>,
              above.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       Linux.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The   definitions   of   <b>MS_DIRSYNC</b>,  <b>MS_MOVE</b>,  <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>,  <b>MS_REC</b>,  <b>MS_RELATIME</b>,  <b>MS_SHARED</b>,  <b>MS_SLAVE</b>,
       <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b>, and <b>MS_UNBINDABLE</b> were added to glibc headers in glibc 2.12.

       Since Linux 2.4 a single filesystem can be mounted at multiple mount points, and multiple mounts  can  be
       stacked on the same mount point.

       The  <u>mountflags</u>  argument  may have the magic number 0xC0ED (<b>MS_MGC_VAL</b>) in the top 16 bits.  (All of the
       other flags discussed in DESCRIPTION occupy the low order 16 bits of <u>mountflags</u>.)  Specifying  <b>MS_MGC_VAL</b>
       was required before Linux 2.4, but since Linux 2.4 is no longer required and is ignored if specified.

       The  original  <b>MS_SYNC</b>  flag  was  renamed <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b> in 1.1.69 when a different <b>MS_SYNC</b> was added to
       <u>&lt;mman.h&gt;</u>.

       Before Linux 2.4 an attempt to execute a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program on a filesystem mounted with
       <b>MS_NOSUID</b> would fail with <b>EPERM</b>.  Since Linux 2.4 the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are just silently
       ignored in this case.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Mount</b> <b>namespaces</b>
       Starting with Linux 2.4.19, Linux provides mount namespaces.  A mount namespace is the set of  filesystem
       mounts  that are visible to a process.  Mount namespaces can be (and usually are) shared between multiple
       processes, and changes to the namespace (i.e., mounts and unmounts) by one process  are  visible  to  all
       other  processes sharing the same namespace.  (The pre-2.4.19 Linux situation can be considered as one in
       which a single namespace was shared by every process on the system.)

       A child process created by <b><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></b>(2) shares its parent's mount namespace; the mount namespace is  preserved
       across an <b><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></b>(2).

       A process can obtain a private mount namespace if: it was created using the <b><a href="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</a></b>(2) <b>CLONE_NEWNS</b> flag, in
       which  case  its  new  namespace  is initialized to be a <u>copy</u> of the namespace of the process that called
       <b><a href="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</a></b>(2); or it calls <b><a href="../man2/unshare.2.html">unshare</a></b>(2) with the <b>CLONE_NEWNS</b> flag, which causes the caller's mount namespace  to
       obtain  a  private  copy  of  the  namespace that it was previously sharing with other processes, so that
       future mounts and unmounts by the caller are invisible to other processes (except  child  processes  that
       the caller subsequently creates) and vice versa.

       For further details on mount namespaces, see <b><a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces</a></b>(7).

   <b>Parental</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>mounts</b>
       Each  mount  has  a  parent  mount.   The  overall parental relationship of all mounts defines the single
       directory hierarchy seen by the processes within a mount namespace.

       The parent of a new mount is defined when the mount is created.  In the usual case, the parent of  a  new
       mount is the mount of the filesystem containing the directory or file at which the new mount is attached.
       In  the case where a new mount is stacked on top of an existing mount, the parent of the new mount is the
       previous mount that was stacked at that location.

       The parental relationship between mounts can be discovered via the <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/mountinfo</u> file (see below).

   <u><b><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></b></u><b>pid</b><u><b>/mounts</b></u> <b>and</b> <u><b><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></b></u><b>pid</b><u><b>/mountinfo</b></u>
       The Linux-specific <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/mounts</u> file exposes the list of mounts in the mount namespace of the process
       with the specified ID.   The  <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/mountinfo</u>  file  exposes  even  more  information  about  mounts,
       including  the  propagation type and mount ID information that makes it possible to discover the parental
       relationship between mounts.  See <b><a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</a></b>(5) and <b><a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces</a></b>(7) for details of this file.
