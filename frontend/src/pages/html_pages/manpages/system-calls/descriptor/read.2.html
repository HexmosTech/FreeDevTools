</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       read - read from a file descriptor

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C library (<u>libc</u>, <u>-lc</u>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;</b>

       <b>ssize_t</b> <b>read(int</b> <u>fd</u><b>,</b> <b>void</b> <u>buf</u><b>[.</b><u>count</u><b>],</b> <b>size_t</b> <u>count</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>read</b>() attempts to read up to <u>count</u> bytes from file descriptor <u>fd</u> into the buffer starting at <u>buf</u>.

       On  files  that  support seeking, the read operation commences at the file offset, and the file offset is
       incremented by the number of bytes read.  If the file offset is at or past the end of file, no bytes  are
       read, and <b>read</b>() returns zero.

       If  <u>count</u>  is  zero,  <b>read</b>()  <u>may</u> detect the errors described below.  In the absence of any errors, or if
       <b>read</b>() does not check for errors, a <b>read</b>() with a <u>count</u> of 0 returns zero and has no other effects.

       According to POSIX.1, if <u>count</u> is greater than <b>SSIZE_MAX</b>, the result is implementation-defined; see NOTES
       for the upper limit on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       On success, the number of bytes read is returned (zero indicates end of file), and the file  position  is
       advanced  by  this  number.   It  is  not  an  error  if  this number is smaller than the number of bytes
       requested; this may happen for example because fewer  bytes  are  actually  available  right  now  (maybe
       because  we  were  close  to  end-of-file, or because we are reading from a pipe, or from a terminal), or
       because <b>read</b>() was interrupted by a signal.  See also NOTES.

       On error, -1 is returned, and <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.  In this case, it is  left  unspecified
       whether the file position (if any) changes.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>EAGAIN</b> The  file  descriptor  <u>fd</u>  refers  to  a  file other than a socket and has been marked nonblocking
              (<b>O_NONBLOCK</b>), and the read would block.  See <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2) for further details on the <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> flag.

       <b>EAGAIN</b> or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              The file descriptor <u>fd</u> refers to a socket and has been marked nonblocking  (<b>O_NONBLOCK</b>),  and  the
              read  would  block.   POSIX.1-2001  allows either error to be returned for this case, and does not
              require these constants to have the same value, so a portable application should  check  for  both
              possibilities.

       <b>EBADF</b>  <u>fd</u> is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for reading.

       <b>EFAULT</b> <u>buf</u> is outside your accessible address space.

       <b>EINTR</b>  The call was interrupted by a signal before any data was read; see <b><a href="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</a></b>(7).

       <b>EINVAL</b> <u>fd</u>  is  attached  to  an  object  which is unsuitable for reading; or the file was opened with the
              <b>O_DIRECT</b> flag, and either the address specified in <u>buf</u>, the value specified in <u>count</u>, or the  file
              offset is not suitably aligned.

       <b>EINVAL</b> <u>fd</u>  was created via a call to <b><a href="../man2/timerfd_create.2.html">timerfd_create</a></b>(2) and the wrong size buffer was given to <b>read</b>(); see
              <b><a href="../man2/timerfd_create.2.html">timerfd_create</a></b>(2) for further information.

       <b>EIO</b>    I/O error.  This will happen for example when the process is in a background process group,  tries
              to  read  from  its  controlling  terminal,  and  either it is ignoring or blocking <b>SIGTTIN</b> or its
              process group is orphaned.  It may also occur when there is a low-level I/O  error  while  reading
              from a disk or tape.  A further possible cause of <b>EIO</b> on networked filesystems is when an advisory
              lock  had  been  taken out on the file descriptor and this lock has been lost.  See the <u>Lost</u> <u>locks</u>
              section of <b><a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</a></b>(2) for further details.

       <b>EISDIR</b> <u>fd</u> refers to a directory.

       Other errors may occur, depending on the object connected to <u>fd</u>.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.1-2008.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       On Linux, <b>read</b>() (and similar system calls) will  transfer  at  most  0x7ffff000  (2,147,479,552)  bytes,
       returning the number of bytes actually transferred.  (This is true on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.)

       On  NFS  filesystems,  reading  small  amounts  of  data  will  update the timestamp only the first time,
       subsequent calls may not do so.  This is caused by client side attribute caching, because most if not all
       NFS clients leave <u>st_atime</u> (last file access time) updates to the server, and client side reads satisfied
       from the client's cache will not cause <u>st_atime</u> updates on the server as there are no server-side  reads.
       UNIX  semantics  can  be obtained by disabling client-side attribute caching, but in most situations this
       will substantially increase server load and decrease performance.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       According to POSIX.1-2008/SUSv4 Section XSI 2.9.7 ("Thread Interactions with Regular File Operations"):

           All of the following functions shall be atomic with respect to each other in the effects specified in
           POSIX.1-2008 when they operate on regular files or symbolic links: ...

       Among the APIs subsequently listed are <b>read</b>() and <b><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></b>(2).  And among the effects that should be  atomic
       across  threads (and processes) are updates of the file offset.  However, before Linux 3.14, this was not
       the case: if two processes that share an open  file  description  (see  <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2))  perform  a  <b>read</b>()  (or
       <b><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></b>(2))  at  the  same  time, then the I/O operations were not atomic with respect to updating the file
       offset, with the result that the reads in the two processes might (incorrectly) overlap in the blocks  of
       data that they obtained.  This problem was fixed in Linux 3.14.
