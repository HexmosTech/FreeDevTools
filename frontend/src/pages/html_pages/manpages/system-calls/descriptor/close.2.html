</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       close - close a file descriptor

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C library (<u>libc</u>, <u>-lc</u>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>close(int</b> <u>fd</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>close</b>()  closes a file descriptor, so that it no longer refers to any file and may be reused.  Any record
       locks (see <b><a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</a></b>(2)) held on the file it was associated with, and  owned  by  the  process,  are  removed
       regardless  of  the  file  descriptor  that  was  used  to  obtain  the  lock.  This has some unfortunate
       consequences and one should be extra careful when  using  advisory  record  locking.   See  <b><a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</a></b>(2)  for
       discussion  of  the  risks and consequences as well as for the (probably preferred) open file description
       locks.

       If <u>fd</u> is the last file descriptor referring to the underlying open file description  (see  <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2)),  the
       resources  associated  with  the  open  file  description  are freed; if the file descriptor was the last
       reference to a file which has been removed using <b><a href="../man2/unlink.2.html">unlink</a></b>(2), the file is deleted.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>close</b>() returns zero on success.  On error, -1 is returned, and <u>errno</u> is set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>EBADF</b>  <u>fd</u> isn't a valid open file descriptor.

       <b>EINTR</b>  The <b>close</b>() call was interrupted by a signal; see <b><a href="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</a></b>(7).

       <b>EIO</b>    An I/O error occurred.

       <b>ENOSPC</b>
       <b>EDQUOT</b> On NFS, these errors are not normally reported against the first write which exceeds the available
              storage space, but instead against a subsequent <b><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/fsync.2.html">fsync</a></b>(2), or <b>close</b>().

       See NOTES for a discussion of why <b>close</b>() should not be retried after an error.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.1-2008.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.1-2001, SVr4, 4.3BSD.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       A successful close does not guarantee that the data has been successfully saved to disk,  as  the  kernel
       uses  the  buffer  cache  to  defer  writes.   Typically, filesystems do not flush buffers when a file is
       closed.  If you need to be sure that the data is physically stored on the underlying disk, use  <b><a href="../man2/fsync.2.html">fsync</a></b>(2).
       (It will depend on the disk hardware at this point.)

       The  close-on-exec  file  descriptor  flag  can be used to ensure that a file descriptor is automatically
       closed upon a successful <b><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></b>(2); see <b><a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</a></b>(2) for details.

   <b>Multithreaded</b> <b>processes</b> <b>and</b> <b>close()</b>
       It is probably unwise to close file descriptors while they may be in use by system calls in other threads
       in the same process.  Since a file descriptor may be reused, there are some obscure race conditions  that
       may cause unintended side effects.

       Furthermore, consider the following scenario where two threads are performing operations on the same file
       descriptor:

       (1)  One  thread  is  blocked in an I/O system call on the file descriptor.  For example, it is trying to
            <b><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></b>(2) to a pipe that is already full, or trying to <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2) from a stream socket  which  currently
            has no available data.

       (2)  Another thread closes the file descriptor.

       The  behavior  in  this  situation  varies  across systems.  On some systems, when the file descriptor is
       closed, the blocking system call returns immediately with an error.

       On Linux (and possibly some other systems), the behavior is different: the blocking I/O system call holds
       a reference to the underlying open file description, and this reference keeps the description open  until
       the  I/O  system  call  completes.   (See <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2) for a discussion of open file descriptions.)  Thus, the
       blocking system call in the first thread may successfully  complete  after  the  <b>close</b>()  in  the  second
       thread.

   <b>Dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>error</b> <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> <b>close()</b>
       A  careful programmer will check the return value of <b>close</b>(), since it is quite possible that errors on a
       previous <b><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></b>(2) operation are  reported  only  on  the  final  <b>close</b>()  that  releases  the  open  file
       description.   Failing  to  check  the  return value when closing a file may lead to <u>silent</u> loss of data.
       This can especially be observed with NFS and with disk quota.

       Note, however, that a failure return should be used only for diagnostic purposes (i.e., a warning to  the
       application  that  there may still be I/O pending or there may have been failed I/O) or remedial purposes
       (e.g., writing the file once more or creating a backup).

       Retrying the <b>close</b>() after a failure return is the wrong thing to do, since this may cause a reused  file
       descriptor from another thread to be closed.  This can occur because the Linux kernel <u>always</u> releases the
       file  descriptor  early in the close operation, freeing it for reuse; the steps that may return an error,
       such as flushing data to the filesystem or device, occur only later in the close operation.

       Many other implementations similarly always close the file descriptor  (except  in  the  case  of  <b>EBADF</b>,
       meaning  that  the  file descriptor was invalid) even if they subsequently report an error on return from
       <b>close</b>().  POSIX.1 is currently silent on this point, but there are plans to mandate this behavior in  the
       next major release of the standard.

       A careful programmer who wants to know about I/O errors may precede <b>close</b>() with a call to <b><a href="../man2/fsync.2.html">fsync</a></b>(2).

       The <b>EINTR</b> error is a somewhat special case.  Regarding the <b>EINTR</b> error, POSIX.1-2008 says:

              If  <b>close</b>()  is interrupted by a signal that is to be caught, it shall return -1 with <u>errno</u> set to
              <b>EINTR</b> and the state of <u>fildes</u> is unspecified.

       This permits the behavior that occurs on Linux and many  other  implementations,  where,  as  with  other
       errors that may be reported by <b>close</b>(), the file descriptor is guaranteed to be closed.  However, it also
       permits another possibility: that the implementation returns an <b>EINTR</b> error and keeps the file descriptor
       open.   (According  to its documentation, HP-UX's <b>close</b>() does this.)  The caller must then once more use
       <b>close</b>() to close the file descriptor, to avoid file descriptor leaks.  This divergence in  implementation
       behaviors  provides  a difficult hurdle for portable applications, since on many implementations, <b>close</b>()
       must not be called again after an <b>EINTR</b> error, and on at least one, <b>close</b>() must be called again.   There
       are plans to address this conundrum for the next major release of the POSIX.1 standard.
