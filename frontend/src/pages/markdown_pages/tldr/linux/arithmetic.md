- Start an arithmetic quiz:

`arithmetic`

- Specify one or more arithmetic [o]peration symbols to get problems on them:

`arithmetic -o {{+|-|x|/}}`

- Specify a range. Addition and multiplication problems would feature numbers between 0 and range, inclusive. Subtraction and division problems would have required result and number to be operated on, between 0 and range:

`arithmetic -r {{7}}`
