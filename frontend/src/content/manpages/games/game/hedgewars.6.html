</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Hedgewars - a free turn based strategy game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hedgewars</b> [<u>OPTION</u>...]  [<u>CONNECTSTRING</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Each  player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of the game, players take turns with
       one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to  attack  and  kill  the
       opponents'  hedgehogs,  thereby  winning  the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of
       ways, normally by walking and jumping  but  also  by  using  particular  tools  such  as  the  "Rope"  or
       "Parachute", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do
       not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b> Displays help and exits

       <b>--config-dir=PATH</b>
              Custom path for configuration data and user data

       <b>--data-dir=PATH</b>
              Custom path to the game data folder

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTSTRING</b></h4><pre>
       If  a  CONNECTSTRING  (e.g.  "hwplay://netserver.hedgewars.org")  is supplied, then hedgewars will try to
       connect to the specified destination on start.
