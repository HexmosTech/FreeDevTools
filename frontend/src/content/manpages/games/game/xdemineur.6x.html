</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xdemineur - X11 minesweeper game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xdemineur</b> [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-display</b> <u>displayname</u>] [<b>-geometry</b> <u>geom</u>] [<b>-m</b> <u>mines</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xdemineur</u> is a minesweeper game for the X Window System.

       The  object  of  this game is to find the location of the mines hidden in the minefield and to mark their
       location by placing a warning flag.  You have exactly as many flags as there are mines.   The  number  of
       flags that remain to be placed is displayed in the top left corner of the window and a timer is displayed
       in the top right corner.

       The  game  is  played  using  a  three buttons mouse, as usual with the X Window System.  The left button
       (button 1) is used to uncover the square on which you click (hoping that a mine  is  not  hidden  there).
       The  number displayed in an uncovered square indicates how many mines are located around this square (for
       example, a 3 means that there are three mines within the 8 surrounding squares).  The whole  game  relies
       on the right use of these numbers.  The right button (button 3) is used to place a flag on a square (this
       indicates  that  there  is a mine here).  If you click again with the right button on a square that has a
       flag, the flag is changed into a question mark: this is useful if you are trying to  guess  the  possible
       location  of  some  mine,  you  can  use question marks to think about it.  One more click with the right
       button and the question mark disappears.  Clicking with the middle button  (button  2)  on  an  uncovered
       square  which  has  all  its flags placed around uncovers the surrounding cells which have no flags (this
       will save a lot of time).

       Finally, to start a new game, just click on the yellow face above the minefield.
