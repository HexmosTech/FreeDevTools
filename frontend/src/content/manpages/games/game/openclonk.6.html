</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>openclonk</b> - multiplayer game of strategy, action and skill

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>openclonk</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       OpenClonk is a free multiplayer action game where you control clonks, small but witty and nimble humanoid
       beings.  The  game  is  mainly about mining, settling and fast-paced melees. OpenClonk is also not just a
       game but also a versatile 2D game engine that offers countless possibilities to make own mods.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Without startup parameters, the game starts in fullscreen (player mode) and shows the startup  menu.  The
       following command line parameters are recognized:

       <b>--editor</b>
              Starts in editor mode (also called developer mode or windowed mode). In editor mode, scenarios can
              be  edited  and  saved.  The  game  will  also  start  in editor mode if a scenario (*.ocs) and no
              <b>--fullscreen</b> is specified.

       <b>--fullscreen</b>
              Starts in fullscreen mode (also called player mode). If no scenario and no direct join address  is
              given, the startup menu is shown.

       <b>--config</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Loads  and  saves  the  configuration from the specified file instead of the default configuration
              file.

       <b>--record</b>
              The round is recorded.

       <b>--network</b>, <b>--nonetwork</b>
              Activates or deactivates network mode.

       <b>--signup</b>, <b>--nosignup</b>
              Activates or deactivates online signup of the game as public internet game.  This value is  stored
              in the configuration.

              <b>--signup</b> implies <b>--network</b>. <b>--nosignup</b> implies <b>--noleague</b>.

       <b>--league</b>, <b>--noleague</b>
              Activates  or  deactivates  online  signup of the game as league game. This value is stored in the
              configuration.

              <b>--league</b> implies <b>--network</b> and <b>--signup</b>.

       <b>--runtimejoin</b>, <b>--noruntimejoin</b>
              Activates or deactivates runtime join. This setting will be stored in the configuration.

       <b>--lobby</b>[=<u>TIME</u>]
              Activates the lobby before a network game is started. The lobby is the waiting  and  chat  screen.
              The lobby is on by default for all network games.

              Implies <b>--network</b>. If you specify a time (e.g. <b>--lobby=120</b>) the lobby will start with a countdown,
              automatically launching the game after (in this case) 120 seconds.

       <b>--observe</b>
              For network games: The client joins as observer (without players).

              Implies <b>--network</b>.

       <b>--join</b>=<u>ADDRESS</u>, <b>clonk://</b><u>ADDRESS</u><b>/</b>
              Searches  for  a  network  game  on  the specified address and joins it. No local scenario (*.ocs)
              should be specified.

              Implies <b>--network.</b>

       <b>--tcpport</b>=<u>PORT</u>
              Sets the TCP port number for client connections in network games. This setting will be  stored  in
              the configuration. If <b>-1</b> is specified, TCP is disabled and all connections are created using UDP.

       <b>--udpport</b>=<u>PORT</u>
              Sets  the  UDP port number for client connections in network games. This setting will be stored in
              the configuration. If <b>-1</b> is specified, UDP is disabled and all connections are created using TCP.

       <b>--pass</b>[=<u>PASSWORD</u>]
              For network hosts: sets the join password to the specified value. If PASSWORD is  left  empty,  no
              password is set.

       <b>--comment</b>=<u>COMMENT</u>
              For  network  hosts:  sets  the  network  game  comment.  This  setting  will  be  stored  in  the
              configuration.

       <b>--update</b>
              Performs an update check at program start.

       <b>--recdump</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Only for replay of recorded games: Before the replay is started, all replay data (player controls)
              are dumped into a file called FILE in the Clonk folder.  If the file name extension is  .txt,  the
              controls  will  be  dumped  in  text  mode,  otherwise  binary.  The replay file must be specified
              separately as a scenario file (e.g. openclonk Records.ocf/Record001.ocs --recdump=CtrlRec.txt).

       <b>--startup</b>=<u>NAME</u>
              Only for fullscreen startup menu: Instead of the main menu, one of the submenus is shown directly.
              Possible values for NAME are "main" (Main menu), "scen" (Scenario selection), "netscen"  (Scenario
              selection  for  a  new network game), "net" (Network/Internet game list), "options" (Options menu)
              and "plrsel" (Player selection).

       <b>*.ocs</b>  If a scenario is specified (File extension .ocs), it will be started directly.

       <b>*.ocd</b>  If the started scenario does not specify any required definitions (File extension  .ocd),  and  no
              definitions are supplied in the registry, definitions can be specified via command line.

       <b>*.ocp</b>  Player  files  (File  extension .ocp) can be specified in the command line. If no player files are
              given, the config values are used. By specifying a non-existant  player  (like  doesnotexist.ocp),
              the game can be started without players (e.g. in order to just edit landscapes in developer mode).
