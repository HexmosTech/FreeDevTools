</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       alex4 - Alex the Allegator 4, a retro platform game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>alex4</b> [<u>gamefile</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Guide  Alex  the  Allegator  through the jungle in order to save his girlfriend Lola from evil humans who
       want to make a pair of shoes out of her.

       Alex the Allegator 4 is a platform game in the style of old Gameboy games.  You can play the game with  a
       keyboard or a joystick.  On the keyboard the following keys are used:

       Arrow keys   Movement

       Alt          Jump

       Control      Shoot (only when you've found eggs to fire!)

       When you're on the menu screen, you can choose the window size with the following keys:

       1    160x120 window

       2    320x240 window

       3    640x480 window

       4    full-screen

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOM</b> <b>MAPS</b></h4><pre>
       The  Alex  the  Allegator  homepage links to many user-contributed maps.  Each set should contain several
       ".map" files and a text file describing the collection.  To play the maps, simply start  alex4  with  the
       name of the text file as argument.

       If  you  want  to create your own maps, you can use the built-in map editor (described below), but you'll
       need to create the description file yourself.  This is a plain text file that  needs  to  list  the  file
       names  of  your  maps  between  "#start#"  and "#end#" markers (these markers are not optional).  You can
       include a description of the maps outside these markers.  For example, for a collection of three maps:

              In this game, Alex must rescue the Yellow Tetris Piece from the pirates of Ching Shih.
              #start#
              journey.map
              sea-of-despair.map
              endgame.map
              #end#

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>MAP</b> <b>EDITOR</b></h4><pre>
       Use the map editor to create your own maps.  You can enter the map editor from  the  menu  screen  or  by
       pressing F1 while playing a custom map.  The basic editor commands are:

       Shift+L             load an existing map

       Shift+S             save the map

       Insert+Left/Right   widen the map

       Delete+Left/Right   shorten the map

       F1                  change the map's properties, e.g. its name.

       Maps are composed of tiles.  Tiles can contain scenery, enemies, items and other game objects.  The mouse
       cursor  shows  the  currently  selected  tile.   To draw tiles, use the left mouse button.  You can cycle
       through the available tiles by using the z and x keys, choose a tile from a palette using the p  key,  or
       pick a tile from the screen using the right mouse button.

       Tiles can be given special behavior using the following commands:

       q         instant death

       w         map exit

       e         roll activator

       r         breakable block

       t         submerged in water

       y         on the water surface

       a         Alex' start location (facing left)

       Shift+A   Alex' start location (facing right)

       Use the following command to place items and enemies:

       1         extra life

       2         star bonus

       3         cherry bonus

       4         egg

       5         extra heart

       Shift+Q   grunt

       Shift+W   spear grunt

       Shift+E   crusher

       Shift+R   spike fish

       Shift+T   jellyfish

       Shift+Y   cannon

       Shift+U   spike truck boss

       Shift+I   ground pounder boss
