</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       a7xpg - chase action game

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A7Xpg  is  a  chase  action  game. The goal of the game is to collect all the gold bullions found in each
       level and avoid crashing into any of the enemies. As you progress through the levels you  will  encounter
       harder enemies, and you can gain a short period of invincibility if you gather gold at high speeds.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These options are available:

       <b>-brightness</b> <b>n</b>
              Set the brightness of the screen.(n = 0 - 100, default = 100)

       <b>-luminous</b> <b>n</b>
              Set the luminous intensity.(n = 0 - 100, default = 50)

       <b>-nosound</b>
              Stop the sound.

       <b>-window</b>
              Launch the game in a window.

       <b>-fullscreen</b>
              Launch the game in fullscreen.

       <b>-lowres</b>
              Use the low resolution mode.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Keys:

       <b>Movement</b>
              Arrow, Num key / Joystick

       <b>Boost</b>  [Z][X][L-Ctrl][L-Alt] / Trigger 1-4

       <b>Pause</b>  [P]

       <b>Quit</b>   [ESC]

       Control  your  ship  and  gather golds. The ship accelerates while holding the boost button.A boost power
       runs out about 1.5 seconds, so you have to push the boost button again to maintain the speed.

       The gauge at the right-down corner is the power gauge. The power increases when you take a gold  at  high
       speed.  When  the  power gauge becomes full, your ship becomes invincible for a while. Attack enemies and
       earn the bonus score.

       The ship is destroyed when you touch the enemy. When you gather a given number of golds, you  can  go  to
       the next stage. If the timer at the right-up corner runs out, you also lose the ship.

       When  all ships are destroyed, the game is over. The ship extends 20,000 and every 50,000 points. If your
       score is over 100,000, you can continue the game.
