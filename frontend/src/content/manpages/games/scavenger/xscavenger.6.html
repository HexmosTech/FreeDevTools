</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       scavenger - a plattform game for X

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scavenger</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Scavenger</b> is like Lode Runner. You've got to run around gathering objects while avoiding enemies. You can
       dig  down through some of the blocks to get at buried objects. After you've collected everything, ladders
       may appear.  To finish the level you've got to exit through the top of the screen. If an enemy falls into
       a dug brick, he is stunned for a while. If the brick fills in with him in it, he is killed, and  he  will
       reappear at the top of the screen.

       This version has a level editor for designing your own levels, and a graphics editor for drawing your own
       artwork.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This command has no options.

</pre><h4><b>GAME</b> <b>CONTROLS</b></h4><pre>
       The default control is with the number pad keys 4-9:

        Dig left     Move up     Dig right
            7           8           9
            4           5           6
        Move left   Move down    Move right

       As  of version 1.3 you can remap the controls. In demo mode hit space to get to the menu, then hit F10 to
       remap the keys. For each key if you hit escape the key is unchanged.
