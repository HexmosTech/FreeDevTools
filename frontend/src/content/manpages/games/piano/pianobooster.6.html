</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Piano  Booster  is  a fun way of playing along with a musical accompaniment and at the same time learning
       the basics of reading musical notation. The difference between playing along to a CD or a  standard  midi
       file is that Piano Booster listens and follows what you are playing on a midi piano keyboard.

       The  program  has  been  designed  to allow you to play along on a midi piano keyboard with the scrolling
       notes shown on the screen. The notes you press on the keyboard appear as colored  lines  on  the  musical
       stave, the color of which depends whether you have pressed the right or wrong note.

       A different musical instrument sound is used for your playing depending whether you are playing the right
       or  wrong  notes.  This  feature also allows Piano Booster to be used with printed sheet music so you can
       hear if you are playing the right notes while at the same time keeping your eyes on  the  printed  score.
       The music accompaniment will automatically wait for you to find and play the correct notes in the piece.

       Timing  markers  show  whether  you are playing ahead or behind of the beat. They appear as white crosses
       that are drawn over the note.

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       - Piano Booster follows you when playing along to a musical accompaniment. If you stop, then so does  the
       music.
       -  Play  a single hand and Piano Booster will play the other hand, as well as the rest of instruments, in
       time with you.
       - Change the speed of playback to match your playing ability.
       - Transpose +/- 12 semitones without stopping the play back.
       - Change the Key Signature of the piece.
       - Plays any standard midi or kar file.
       - Play along to any instrument in the midi file.
       - Adjust the volume of the current part or the volume your piano part.
       - See how accurate you're playing.
       - Change the start bar to start playing from any bar in the music. The repeat bars allows you to practice
       just a few difficult bars continuously.
       - Timing markers are white crosses that are drawn over each note and show if you  are  playing  ahead  or
       behind the beat.
       - A different instrument sound is used for the right and wrong notes that you play.
