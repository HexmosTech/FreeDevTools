</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>polytopes</u>  program  shows  one  of  the  six regular 4d polytopes (5-cell, 8-cell, 16-cell, 24-cell,
       120-cell, or 600-cell) rotating in 4d.  The program projects  the  4d  polytope  to  3d  using  either  a
       perspective or an orthographic projection.  The projected 3d polytope can then be projected to the screen
       either  perspectively  or  orthographically.   There  are  three  display  modes  for  the polytope: mesh
       (wireframe), solid, or transparent.  Furthermore, the colors with which the polytope is drawn can be  set
       to either single color or to a coloring according to the 4d "depth" (the w coordinate) of the polytope in
       its  unrotated  position.   In the first case, the polytope is drawn in red.  This coloring combined with
       transparency gives a nice visual effect of the structure of the polytope.   The  second  mode  draws  the
       polytope  with  a  fully saturated color wheel in which the edges or faces are colored according to their
       average 4d "depth".  This mode is best combined with the wireframe mode, where it allows you to  see  how
       different parts of the polytope are moved to the "inside" of the projected polytope in 3d.  Of course, in
       4d  the  cells,  faces,  and  edges  of  the  polytope  all have the same distance from the center of the
       polytope.  Only the projection creates the appearance that some of the cells lie "inside" the  figure  in
       3d.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>polytopes</u> accepts the following options:

       <b>--window</b>
               Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       <b>--root</b>  Draw on the root window.

       <b>--window-id</b> <u>number</u>
               Draw on the specified window.

       <b>--install</b>
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       <b>--visual</b> <u>visual</u>
               Specify  which  visual  to  use.   Legal  values are the name of a visual class, or the id number
               (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.

       <b>--delay</b> <u>microseconds</u>
               How much of a delay should be introduced between steps  of  the  animation.   Default  25000,  or
               1/40th second.

       The following six options are mutually exclusive.  They determine which polytope is displayed.

       <b>-5-cell</b> Display  the  5-cell.   The  5-cell  is the 4d analogon of a regular tetrahedron in 3d.  It has 5
               regular tetrahedra as its cells, 10 equilateral triangles as faces, 10 edges, and 5 vertices.

       <b>-8-cell</b> Display the 8-cell (a.k.a. hypercube or tessaract).  The 8-cell is the 4d analogon of a  cube  in
               3d.  It has 8 cubes as its cells, 24 squares as faces, 32 edges, and 16 vertices.

       <b>-16-cell</b>
               Display  the  16-cell.  The 16-cell is the 4d analogon of an octahedron in 3d.  It has 16 regular
               tetrahedra as its cells, 32 equilateral triangles as faces, 24 edges, and 8 vertices.

       <b>-24-cell</b>
               Display the 24-cell.  The 24-cell has no 3d analogon.  It has 24 regular octahedra as its  cells,
               96 equilateral triangles as faces, 96 edges, and 24 vertices.

       <b>-120-cell</b>
               Display  the  120-cell.   The 120-cell has no 3d analogon.  It has 120 regular dodecahedra as its
               cells, 720 regular pentagons as faces, 1200 edges, and 600 vertices.

       <b>-600-cell</b>
               Display the 600-cell.  The 600-cell has no 3d analogon.  It has 600  regular  tetrahedra  as  its
               cells, 1200 equilateral triangles as faces, 720 edges, and 120 vertices.

       The following three options are mutually exclusive.  They determine how the polytope is displayed.

       <b>--wireframe</b>
               Display the polytope as a wireframe mesh.

       <b>--surface</b>
               Display the polytope as a solid object.

       <b>--transparent</b>
               Display the polytope as a transparent object (default).

       The following two options are mutually exclusive.  They determine how to color the polytope.

       <b>--single-color</b>
               Display the polytope in red.

       <b>--depth-colors</b>
               Display  the  polytope with a fully saturated color wheel in which the edges or faces are colored
               according to their average 4d "depth", i.e., the w coordinate of the polytope  in  its  unrotated
               position (default).

       The  following  two options are mutually exclusive.  They determine how the polytope is projected from 3d
       to 2d (i.e., to the screen).

       <b>--perspective-3d</b>
               Project the polytope from 3d to 2d using a perspective projection (default).

       <b>--orthographic-3d</b>
               Project the polytope from 3d to 2d using an orthographic projection.

       The following two options are mutually exclusive.  They determine how the polytope is projected  from  4d
       to 3d.

       <b>--perspective-4d</b>
               Project the polytope from 4d to 3d using a perspective projection (default).

       <b>--orthographic-4d</b>
               Project the polytope from 4d to 3d using an orthographic projection.

       The  following  six  options  determine  the  rotation  speed  of  the  polytope  around the six possible
       hyperplanes.  The rotation speed is measured  in  degrees  per  frame.   The  speeds  should  be  set  to
       relatively small values, e.g., less than 4 in magnitude.

       <b>--speed-wx</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the wx plane (default: 1.1).

       <b>--speed-wy</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the wy plane (default: 1.3).

       <b>--speed-wz</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the wz plane (default: 1.5).

       <b>--speed-xy</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the xy plane (default: 1.7).

       <b>--speed-xz</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the xz plane (default: 1.9).

       <b>--speed-yz</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the yz plane (default: 2.1).

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTION</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  run  this  program  in  standalone  mode you can rotate the polytope by dragging the mouse while
       pressing the left mouse button.  This rotates the polytope in 3D, i.e., around the wx, wy, and wz planes.
       If you press the shift key while dragging the mouse with the left button pressed the polytope is  rotated
       in  4D,  i.e.,  around the xy, xz, and yz planes.  To examine the polytope at your leisure, it is best to
       set all speeds to 0.  Otherwise, the polytope will rotate while the left mouse  button  is  not  pressed.
       <b>--fps</b> Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> to get the default host and display number.

       <b>XENVIRONMENT</b>
               to  get  the  name  of  a  resource  file  that  overrides  the  global  resources  stored in the
               RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

       <b>XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW</b>
               The window ID to use with <u>--root</u>.
