</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The original puzzle has 9 triangles per face (size = 3) and has period 4 turning (i.e. the face or points
       turn  with  90 degree intervals).  The puzzle was designed by Uwe Meffert and called the Magic Octahedron
       (or Star Puzzler).  The puzzle was not widely distributed but not exactly rare.   This  puzzle  has  some
       analogies  to  the  Rubik's  Cube  and  the  solving  techniques  are  the  same to that of the Pyraminx.
       Christoph's Magic Jewel is similar except there are no trivial corners to solve.  This  has  2^22*12!  or
       2,009,078,326,886,400 different combinations.

       Uwe Meffert also noticed that there could be an alternate twisting for the octahedron where it has period
       3 turning (i.e. faces turn with 120 degree intervals).

       One  is  able to simulate a Trajber's Octahedron (period 3 turning and sticky mode).  Also one is able to
       simulate one with variant turning (period 4 turning and sticky mode).

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       Press "<b>mouse-left</b>" button to move a piece.  Release "<b>mouse-left</b>" button on a piece on the same  face  and
       in  the same row (but not an adjacent piece or the move is ambiguous).  The pieces will then turn towards
       where the mouse button was released.

       Click "<b>mouse-center</b>", or press "<b>P</b>" or "<b>p</b>" keys to toggle the practice mode (in practice mode  the  record
       should say "practice").  This is good for learning moves and experimenting.

       Click  "<b>mouse-right</b>", or press "<b>Z</b>" or "<b>z</b>" keys, to randomize the puzzle (this must be done first to set a
       new record).

       Press "<b>G</b>" or "<b>g</b>" keys to read (get) a saved puzzle.

       Press "<b>W</b>" or "<b>w</b>" keys to save (write) a puzzle.

       Press "<b>U</b>" or "<b>u</b>" keys to undo a move.

       Press "<b>R</b>" or "<b>r</b>" keys to redo a move.

       Press "<b>C</b>" or "<b>c</b>" keys to clear the puzzle.

       Press"<b>S</b>" or "<b>s</b>" keys to start auto-solver.  Only works where size &lt; 4 (or sticky mode set)  in  Period  3
       mode or size &lt; 5 in Period 4 mode.

       Press  "<b>O</b>"  or  "<b>o</b>"  keys to toggle the orient mode.  One has to orient the faces in orient mode, besides
       getting all the faces to be the same color.  To do this one has to get the lines to be  oriented  in  the
       same  direction,  this  only matters with center pieces, if at all (i.e.  those pieces not on a corner or
       edge).  This does add complexity so there are 2 sets of records.

       Press "<b>3</b>", "<b>4</b>", "<b>B</b>", or "<b>b</b>" keys (not the keypad 3, 4) to change modes to Period 3, Period 4, or Both.

       Press "<b>Y</b>" or "<b>y</b>" keys to toggle sticky mode (increase/decrease is disabled here if sticky mode is on).
       "Sticky" and "Period 3" turning allows only the faces to turn, it is as if the middle cut  of  the  three
       cuts did not exist.
       "Sticky"  and  "Period 4" turning allows only the points to turn, it is as if the middle cut of the three
       cuts did not exist.
       Beware, the "Sticky" mode is a hack and much could be done to improve its look.

       Press "<b>I</b>" or "<b>i</b>" keys to increase the number of pieces.

       Press "<b>D</b>" or "<b>d</b>" keys to decrease the number of pieces.

       Press "<b>V</b>" or "<b>v</b>" keys to change the view of the puzzle.

       Press "<b>&gt;</b>" or "<b>.</b>" keys to speed up the movement of pieces.

       Press "<b>&lt;</b>" or "<b>,</b>" keys to slow down the movement of pieces.

       Press "<b>@</b>" key to toggle the sound.

       Press "<b>Esc</b>" key to hide program.

       Press "<b>Q</b>", "<b>q</b>", or "<b>CTRL-C</b>" keys to kill program.

       Use the key pad or arrow keys to move without the mouse.
       Key pad is defined for Oct as:
         /     Counterclockwise

       7 8 9   Upper Left, Up, Upper Right
         ^
       4&lt;5&gt;6   Left, Clockwise, Right
         v
       1 2 3   Lower Left, Down, Lower Right

       Use the shift keys to access "Period 4" turns from "Both" mode, otherwise it assumes "Period 3"  turning.
       Points turn in "Period 4" and faces turn in "Period 3".

       Use  the control key and the left mouse button, keypad, or arrow keys to move the whole octahedron.  This
       is not recorded as a turn.

       The title is in the following format (non-motif version):
              xoct.{3|4|both&lt;turning modes&gt;}: {1|2|3|4|5|6|sticky&lt;number of pieces  per  edge&gt;}  @  (&lt;Number  of
              moves&gt;/{&lt;Record number of moves&gt; &lt;user name&gt;|"NEVER noaccess"|"practice"}) - &lt;Comment&gt;
       If there is no record of the current puzzle, it displays "NEVER noaccess".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-geometry</b> <b>{+|-}</b><u>X</u><b>{+|-}</b><u>Y</u>
               This option sets the initial position of the octahedron window (resource name "<u>geometry</u>").

       <b>-display</b> <u>host</u><b>:</b><u>dpy</u>
               This option specifies the X server to contact.

       <b>-[no]mono</b>
               This  option  allows  you  to  display  the  octahedron  window  on  a color screen as if it were
               monochrome (resource name "<u>mono</u>").

       <b>-[no]{reverse|rv}</b>
               This  option  allows  you  to  see  the  octahedron  window  in  reverse  video  (resource   name
               "<u>reverseVideo</u>").

       <b>-{foreground|fg}</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the foreground of the octahedron window (resource name "<u>foreground</u>").

       <b>-{background|bg}</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the background of the octahedron window (resource name "<u>background</u>").

       <b>-{border|bd}</b> <u>color</u>
               This  option  specifies  the  border  color of the pieces in the octahedron window (resource name
               "<u>borderColor</u>").

       <b>-face{0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7}</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>color</u><b>&gt;</b>
               This option allows you to change the color of a face (resource name "<u>faceColorN</u>"). In  mono-mode,
               color  is  represented as the first letter of the color name. The faces are ordered top to bottom
               and left to right.  If you has two colors that begin with the same letter you should have one  in
               uppercase and one in lowercase to distinguish them in mono-mode. You can change the colors of the
               faces  to  make  a stupid octahedron (i.e. all White or in mono-mode all "W").  Unfortunately, it
               will not normally say its solved when its randomized.  This would be cheating.

       <b>-frame</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the color of the frame (resource name "<u>frameColor</u>").

       <b>-delay</b> <u>msecs</u>
               This option specifies the number of milliseconds it takes to move pieces  (1-50)  (resource  name
               "<u>delay</u>").

       <b>-[no]sound</b>
               This option specifies if sliding pieces should make a sound or not (resource name "<u>sound</u>").

       <b>-moveSound</b> <u>filename</u>
               This  option  specifies the file for the move sound for the twisting of the puzzle (resource name
               "<u>moveSound</u>").

       <b>-{font|fn}</b> <b>ontname</b>
               This option specifies the font that will be used (resource name "<u>font</u>").

       <b>-size</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>int</u><b>&gt;</b>
               This option allows you to change the number of pieces on a edge (resource name "<u>size</u>").

       <b>-sticky</b> This option allows you to set the sticky mode (resource name "<u>sticky</u>").

       <b>-mode</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>int</u><b>&gt;</b>
               This option allows you to set the turning mode (resource name "<u>mode</u>").

       <b>-both</b>   This option allows you to set the turning mode to both period  3  and  period  4  (resource  name
               "<u>mode</u>" set at 5).

       <b>-[no]orient</b>
               This option allows you to access the oriented mode (resource name "<u>orient</u>").

       <b>-[no]practice</b>
               This option allows you to access the practice mode (resource name "<u>practice</u>").

       <b>-userName</b> <u>string</u>
               This  option  specifies  the  user  name for any records made or else it will get your login name
               (resource name "<u>userName</u>").

       <b>-scoreFile</b> <u>filename</u>
               Specify an alternative score file (resource name "<u>scoreFile</u>").

       <b>-scores</b> This option lists all the recorded scores and then exits.

       <b>-version</b>
               This option tells you what version of xoct you have.

</pre><h4><b>RECORDS</b></h4><pre>
       You must randomize the puzzle before a record is set, otherwise an assumption of cheating is made  if  it
       is solved after a get or an auto-solve.

</pre><h4><b>SAVE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here is the format for the xoct configuration, starting position, and the movement of its pieces.

       Octahedron with default colors, not randomized:
         0       R     Red
       3   1   M   B   Magenta, Blue
         2       W     White
         4       O     Orange
       7   5   Y   P   Yellow, Pink
         6       G     Green

              size: 1-6 &lt;number of triangles in the same orientation as the face per row&gt;
              mode: 3-5 &lt;period 3 turning, period 4 turning, or both (5)&gt;
              orient: 0-1 &lt;0 false, 1 true; if 1 then lines on pieces to be oriented&gt;
              sticky: 0-1 &lt;0 false, 1 true; if 1 then some pieces move together&gt;
              practice: 0-1 &lt;0 false, 1 true&gt;
              moves: 0-MAXINT &lt;total number of moves&gt;

              startingPosition:  &lt;2  dimensional array of face piece position, each face has size * size pieces,
              if orient mode then orientation number follows face number numbered clockwise from 0 to 11,  where
              0 is up&gt;

       This is then followed by the moves, starting from 1.
              move #: &lt;direction&gt; &lt;control&gt; &lt;face&gt; &lt;position&gt;
       Each turn is with respect to a face and position.
       Position  is  0  to  size  *  size  - 1.  Position 0 is the triangle furthest from the center, increasing
       clockwise.
       Direction is represented as 0 up, 1 upper right, 2 right, 3 lower right, 4 down, 5 lower left, 6 left,  7
       upper left, 9 clockwise, and 15 counterclockwise.
       Control  is  represented  as  0  or 1, 1 if the whole octahedron is moved at once (here position does not
       matter), 0 if not.  The xoct record keeper does not count a control move as a move, but here we do.
