</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>projectiveplane</u> program shows a 4d embedding of the real projective  plane.   You  can  walk  on  the
       projective plane, see it turn in 4d, or walk on it while it turns in 4d.  The fact that the surface is an
       embedding  of the real projective plane in 4d can be seen in the depth colors mode (using static colors):
       set all rotation speeds to 0 and the projection mode to  4d  orthographic  projection.   In  its  default
       orientation, the embedding of the real projective plane will then project to the Roman surface, which has
       three  lines  of  self-intersection.   However,  at the three lines of self-intersection the parts of the
       surface that intersect have different colors, i.e., different 4d depths.

       The real projective plane is a non-orientable surface.  To make this apparent, the two-sided  color  mode
       can  be  used.   Alternatively, orientation markers (curling arrows) can be drawn as a texture map on the
       surface of the projective plane.  While walking on  the  projective  plane,  you  will  notice  that  the
       orientation of the curling arrows changes (which it must because the projective plane is non-orientable).

       The  real  projective plane is a model for the projective geometry in 2d space.  One point can be singled
       out as the origin.  A line can be singled out as the line at infinity, i.e.,  a  line  that  lies  at  an
       infinite  distance  to  the  origin.   The  line  at infinity, like all lines in the projective plane, is
       topologically a circle.  Points on the line at infinity are also used to model directions  in  projective
       geometry.   The  origin  can  be  visualized in different manners.  When using distance colors (and using
       static colors), the origin is the point that is displayed as fully saturated red, which is easier to  see
       as the center of the reddish area on the projective plane.  Alternatively, when using distance bands, the
       origin is the center of the only band that projects to a disk.  When using direction bands, the origin is
       the  point  where  all  direction bands collapse to a point.  Finally, when orientation markers are being
       displayed, the origin the the point where all orientation markers are compressed to a point.  The line at
       infinity can also be visualized in different ways.  When using distance colors (and using static colors),
       the line at infinity is the line that is displayed as  fully  saturated  magenta.   When  two-sided  (and
       static)  colors  are used, the line at infinity lies at the points where the red and green "sides" of the
       projective plane meet (of course, the real projective plane only has one side, so this is a design choice
       of the visualization).  Alternatively, when orientation markers are being displayed, the line at infinity
       is the place where the orientation markers change their orientation.

       Note that when the projective plane is displayed with bands, the orientation markers are  placed  in  the
       middle  of the bands.  For distance bands, the bands are chosen in such a way that the band at the origin
       is only half as wide as the remaining bands, which results in a disk being displayed at the  origin  that
       has  the  same  diameter  as  the  remaining  bands.  This choice, however, also implies that the band at
       infinity is half as wide as the other bands.  Since the projective plane is  attached  to  itself  (in  a
       complicated  fashion)  at  the line at infinity, effectively the band at infinity is again as wide as the
       remaining bands.  However, since the orientation markers are displayed in the middle of the  bands,  this
       means  that  only  one half of the orientation markers will be displayed twice at the line at infinity if
       distance bands are used.  If direction bands are used or if the projective plane is displayed as a  solid
       surface, the orientation markers are displayed fully at the respective sides of the line at infinity.

       The  program  projects  the  4d  projective  plane  to  3d  using either a perspective or an orthographic
       projection.  Which of the two alternatives looks more appealing  is  up  to  you.   However,  two  famous
       surfaces are obtained if orthographic 4d projection is used: The Roman surface and the cross cap.  If the
       projective  plane is rotated in 4d, the result of the projection for certain rotations is a Roman surface
       and for certain rotations it is a cross cap.  The easiest way to see this is to set all  rotation  speeds
       to  0  and  the  rotation  speed  around  the  yz plane to a value different from 0.  However, for any 4d
       rotation speeds, the projections will generally cycle between the Roman surface and the cross  cap.   The
       difference  is  where the origin and the line at infinity will lie with respect to the self-intersections
       in the projections to 3d.

       The  projected  projective  plane  can  then  be  projected  to  the  screen  either   perspectively   or
       orthographically.  When using the walking modes, perspective projection to the screen will be used.

       There  are  three  display  modes  for  the  projective  plane:  mesh (wireframe), solid, or transparent.
       Furthermore, the appearance of the projective plane can be as a solid object or as a set  of  see-through
       bands.  The bands can be distance bands, i.e., bands that lie at increasing distances from the origin, or
       direction bands, i.e., bands that lie at increasing angles with respect to the origin.

       When  the projective plane is displayed with direction bands, you will be able to see that each direction
       band (modulo the "pinching" at the origin) is a Moebius strip, which also shows that the projective plane
       is non-orientable.

       Finally, the colors with with the projective plane is drawn can be set to one-sided, two-sided, distance,
       direction, or depth.  In one-sided mode, the projective plane is  drawn  with  the  same  color  on  both
       "sides."   In  two-sided mode (using static colors), the projective plane is drawn with red on one "side"
       and green on the "other side."  As described above, the projective plane only has one side, so the  color
       jumps  from  red  to  green along the line at infinity.  This mode enables you to see that the projective
       plane is non-orientable.  If changing colors are used in two-sided mode,  changing  complementary  colors
       are  used  on  the  respective  "sides."   In distance mode, the projective plane is displayed with fully
       saturated colors that depend on the distance of the points on the projective plane  to  the  origin.   If
       static  colors  are  used,  the  origin  is  displayed in red, while the line at infinity is displayed in
       magenta.  If the projective plane is displayed as distance bands, each band  will  be  displayed  with  a
       different  color.   In direction mode, the projective plane is displayed with fully saturated colors that
       depend on the angle of the points on the projective plane with respect to the origin.  Angles in opposite
       directions to the origin (e.g., 15 and 205 degrees) are displayed  in  the  same  color  since  they  are
       projectively  equivalent.   If  the  projective  plane is displayed as direction bands, each band will be
       displayed with a different color.  Finally, in depth mode the projective plane is displayed  with  colors
       chosen  depending on the 4d "depth" (i.e., the w coordinate) of the points on the projective plane at its
       default orientation in 4d.  As discussed above, this mode enables you to see that  the  projective  plane
       does not intersect itself in 4d.

       The  rotation  speed  for each of the six planes around which the projective plane rotates can be chosen.
       For the walk-and-turn mode, only the rotation speeds around the true 4d planes are used (the xy, xz,  and
       yz planes).

       Furthermore, in the walking modes the walking direction in the 2d base square of the projective plane and
       the  walking  speed  can  be  chosen.  The walking direction is measured as an angle in degrees in the 2d
       square that forms the coordinate system of the surface of the projective plane.  A  value  of  0  or  180
       means  that  the  walk  is  along  a  circle at a randomly chosen distance from the origin (parallel to a
       distance band).  A value of 90 or 270 means that the walk is directly from the  origin  to  the  line  at
       infinity  and  back  (analogous  to a direction band).  Any other value results in a curved path from the
       origin to the line at infinity and back.

       This program is somewhat inspired by Thomas  Banchoff's  book  "Beyond  the  Third  Dimension:  Geometry,
       Computer Graphics, and Higher Dimensions", Scientific American Library, 1990.

       <b>--view-mode</b> <b>walk-turn</b> (Shortcut: <b>--walk-turn</b>)

       <b>--no-orientation-marks</b>
               Don't display orientation marks on the projective plane (default).

       The following three options are mutually exclusive.  They determine how the projective plane is projected
       from 3d to 2d (i.e., to the screen).

       <b>--projection-3d</b> <b>random</b>
               Project the projective plane from 3d to 2d using a random projection mode (default).

       <b>--projection-3d</b> <b>perspective</b> (Shortcut: <b>--perspective-3d</b>)
               Project the projective plane from 3d to 2d using a perspective projection.

       <b>--projection-3d</b> <b>orthographic</b> (Shortcut: <b>--orthographic-3d</b>)
               Project the projective plane from 3d to 2d using an orthographic projection.

       The following three options are mutually exclusive.  They determine how the projective plane is projected
       from 4d to 3d.

       <b>--projection-4d</b> <b>random</b>
               Project the projective plane from 4d to 3d using a random projection mode (default).

       <b>--projection-4d</b> <b>orthographic</b> (Shortcut: <b>--orthographic-4d</b>)
               Project the projective plane from 4d to 3d using an orthographic projection.

       The  following  six  options determine the rotation speed of the projective plane around the six possible
       hyperplanes.  The rotation speed is measured  in  degrees  per  frame.   The  speeds  should  be  set  to
       relatively small values, e.g., less than 4 in magnitude.  In walk mode, all speeds are ignored.  In walk-
       and-turn  mode,  the  3d rotation speeds are ignored (i.e., the wx, wy, and wz speeds).  In walk-and-turn
       mode, smaller speeds must be used than in the turn mode to achieve a nice visualization.   Therefore,  in
       walk-and-turn mode the speeds you have selected are divided by 5 internally.

       <b>--speed-wx</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the wx plane (default: 1.1).

       <b>--speed-wy</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the wy plane (default: 1.3).

       <b>--speed-wz</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the wz plane (default: 1.5).

       <b>--speed-xy</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the xy plane (default: 1.7).

       <b>--speed-xz</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the xz plane (default: 1.9).

       <b>--speed-yz</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the yz plane (default: 2.1).

       The following two options determine the walking speed and direction.

       <b>--walk-direction</b> <u>float</u>
               The  walking  direction  is  measured  as  an  angle  in  degrees in the 2d square that forms the
               coordinate system of the surface of the projective plane (default: 83.0).  A value of  0  or  180
               means  that the walk is along a circle at a randomly chosen distance from the origin (parallel to
               a distance band).  A value of 90 or 270 means that the walk is directly from the  origin  to  the
               line  at  infinity and back (analogous to a direction band).  Any other value results in a curved
               path from the origin to the line at infinity and back.

       <b>--walk-speed</b> <u>float</u>
               The walking speed is measured in percent of some sensible maximum speed (default: 20.0).

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTION</b></h4><pre>
       If you run this program in standalone mode in its turn mode, you  can  rotate  the  projective  plane  by
       dragging  the mouse while pressing the left mouse button.  This rotates the projective plane in 3D, i.e.,
       around the wx, wy, and wz planes.  If you press the shift key while dragging  the  mouse  with  the  left
       button pressed the projective plane is rotated in 4D, i.e., around the xy, xz, and yz planes.  To examine
       the projective plane at your leisure, it is best to set all speeds to 0.  Otherwise, the projective plane
       will rotate while the left mouse button is not pressed.  This kind of interaction is not available in the
       two walk modes.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
