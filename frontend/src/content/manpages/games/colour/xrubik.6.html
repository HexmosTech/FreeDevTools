       xrubik - Magic cube X widgets

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  original puzzle has 9 squares per face (size = 3).  The puzzle was designed by Erno Rubik and called
       the Rubik's Cube.  This has 8!*12!*3^8*2^12/12 or 4.3 * 10^19 different combinations.

       The Pocket Cube has 4 squares per face (size = 2) also designed  by  Erno  Rubik.   This  has  7!*3^6  or
       3,674,160 different combinations.

       Rubik's  Revenge  has  16  squares  per  face  (size  =  4)  also  designed  by  Erno  Rubik.   This  has
       7!*3^6*24!*24!/(4!)^6 or 7.4 * 10^46 different combinations.

       5x5x5 Cube.  This has 8!*12!*3^7*2^10*(24!)^3/(4!)^12 or 2.83 * 10^74 different combinations.

       There is also the Magic Domino 3x3x2 cube which has (8!)^2/4 or 406,425,600 combinations.

       A physical 6x6x6 cube is possible but to my knowledge no one has been too  successful  in  building  one.
       7x7x7  is  also possible, but here one must make the center most cubes smaller than the outside cubes, so
       the corners do not fall off when turned.

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       Press "<b>mouse-left</b>" button to move a piece.  Release "<b>mouse-left</b>" button on a piece on the same  face  and
       in the same row.  The pieces will then turn towards where the mouse button was released.

       Click  "<b>mouse-center</b>",  or press "<b>P</b>" or "<b>p</b>" keys to toggle the practice mode (in practice mode the record
       should say "practice").  This is good for learning moves and experimenting.

       Click "<b>mouse-right</b>", or press "<b>Z</b>" or "<b>z</b>" keys, to randomize the puzzle (this must be done first to set  a
       new record).

       Press "<b>G</b>" or "<b>g</b>" keys to read (get) a saved puzzle.

       Press "<b>W</b>" or "<b>w</b>" keys to save (write) a puzzle.

       Press "<b>U</b>" or "<b>u</b>" keys to undo a move.

       Press "<b>R</b>" or "<b>r</b>" keys to redo a move.

       Press "<b>C</b>" or "<b>c</b>" keys to clear the puzzle.

       Press "<b>S</b>" or "<b>s</b>" keys to start auto-solver.  Only works on 2x2x2, 3x3x3, and 4x4x4 cubes.

       Press  "<b>O</b>"  or  "<b>o</b>"  keys to toggle the orient mode.  One has to orient the faces in orient mode, besides
       getting all the faces to be the same color.  To do this one has to get the lines to be  oriented  in  the
       same  direction,  this  only  matters with center piece, if at all (i.e.  those pieces not on a corner or
       edge).  This does add complexity so there are 2 sets of records.

       Press "<b>I</b>" or "<b>i</b>" keys to increase the number of pieces.

       Press "<b>D</b>" or "<b>d</b>" keys to decrease the number of pieces.

       Press "<b>x</b>" key to increase the number of pieces along the x axis.

       Press "<b>X</b>" key to decrease the number of pieces along the x axis.

       Press "<b>y</b>" key to increase the number of pieces along the y axis.

       Press "<b>Y</b>" key to decrease the number of pieces along the y axis.

       Press "<b>j</b>" key to increase the number of pieces along the z axis.

       Press "<b>J</b>" key to decrease the number of pieces along the z axis.

       Press "<b>V</b>" or "<b>v</b>" keys to change the view of the puzzle.

       Press "<b>&gt;</b>" or "<b>.</b>" keys to speed up the movement of pieces.

       Press "<b>&lt;</b>" or "<b>,</b>" keys to slow down the movement of pieces.

       Press "<b>@</b>" key to toggle the sound.

       Press "<b>Esc</b>" key to hide program.

       Press "<b>Q</b>", "<b>q</b>", or "<b>CTRL-C</b>" keys to kill program.

       Use the key pad or arrow keys to move without the mouse.
       Key pad is defined for the Rubik2d as:
         /     Counterclockwise

         8     Up
         ^
       4&lt;5&gt;6   Left, Clockwise, Right
         v
         2     Down

       Key pad for other than Rubik2d, use must use your intuition (is this a cop out or what?).  The key pad is
       defined differently depending on which side of the cube your mouse is pointing at.  One thing that  stays
       the same is "5" is Clockwise and "/" is Counterclockwise.

       Use the control key and the left mouse button, keypad, or arrow keys to move the whole cube.  This is not
       recorded as a turn.

       The title is in the following format (non-motif non-opengl version):
              xrubik{2|3}d&lt;dimension&gt;:  {1|2|3|4|5|6&lt;cubes  per  edge  on x-axis&gt;x{1|2|3|4|5|6&lt;cubes per edge on
              y-axis&gt;x{1|2|3|4|5|6&lt;cubes per edge on z-axis&gt;} @ (&lt;Number of  moves&gt;/{&lt;Record  number  of  moves&gt;
              &lt;user name&gt;|"NEVER noaccess"|"practice"}) - &lt;Comment&gt;
       If there is no record of the current puzzle, it displays "NEVER noaccess".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-geometry</b> <b>{+|-}</b><u>X</u><b>{+|-}</b><u>Y</u>
               This option sets the initial position of the rubik window (resource name "<u>geometry</u>").

       <b>-display</b> <u>host</u><b>:</b><u>dpy</u>
               This option specifies the X server to contact.

       <b>-[no]mono</b>
               This  option  allows  you  to display the rubik window on a color screen as if it were monochrome
               (resource name "<u>mono</u>").

       <b>-[no]{reverse|rv}</b>
               This option allows you to see the rubik window in reverse video (resource name "<u>reverseVideo</u>").

       <b>-{foreground|fg}</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the foreground of the rubik window (resource name "<u>foreground</u>").

       <b>-{background|bg}</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the background of the rubik window (resource name "<u>background</u>").

       <b>-{border|bd}</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the border  color  of  the  pieces  in  the  rubik  window  (resource  name
               "<u>borderColor</u>").

       <b>-face{0|1|2|3|4|5}</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>color</u><b>&gt;</b>
               This  option allows you to change the color of a face (resource name "<u>faceColorN</u>"). In mono-mode,
               color is represented as the first letter of the color name. On the 2-D  version,  the  faces  are
               ordered  top  to  bottom  and  left  to  right on the "t" configuration. The sideways "t" or "+-"
               configuration is physically consistent with the former, so it is ordered "0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4".   If
               you  has  two  colors that begin with the same letter you should have one in uppercase and one in
               lowercase to distinguish them in mono-mode. You can change the colors of  the  faces  to  make  a
               stupid  cube  (i.e.   all White or in mono-mode all "W"). Unfortunately, it will not normally say
               its solved when its randomized. This would be cheating.

       <b>-frame</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the color of the frame (resource name "<u>frameColor</u>").

       <b>-delay</b> <u>msecs</u>
               This option specifies the number of milliseconds it takes to move pieces  (1-50)  (resource  name
               "<u>delay</u>").

       <b>-[no]sound</b>
               This option specifies if sliding pieces should make a sound or not (resource name "<u>sound</u>").

       <b>-moveSound</b> <u>filename</u>
               This  option  specifies  the  file  for  the move sound the twisting of the puzzle (resource name
               "<u>moveSound</u>").

       <b>-{font|fn}</b> <b>ontname</b>
               This option specifies the font that will be used (resource name "<u>font</u>").

       <b>-view</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>int</u><b>&gt;</b>
               This option allows you to change the view of the cube for OpenGL with choice of 4 views (resource
               name "<u>int</u>").

       <b>-sizeX</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>int</u><b>&gt;</b>
               This option allows you to change the number of pieces on  a  edge  along  x-axis  (resource  name
               "<u>sizeX</u>").

       <b>-sizeY</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>int</u><b>&gt;</b>
               This  option  allows  you  to  change  the number of pieces on a edge along y-axis (resource name
               "<u>sizeY</u>").

       <b>-sizeZ</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>int</u><b>&gt;</b>
               This option allows you to change the number of pieces on  a  edge  along  z-axis  (resource  name
               "<u>sizeZ</u>").

       <b>-[no]orient</b>
               This option allows you to access the oriented mode (resource name "<u>orient</u>").

       <b>-[no]practice</b>
               This option allows you to access the practice mode (resource name "<u>practice</u>").

       <b>-userName</b> <u>string</u>
               This  option  specifies  the  user  name for any records made or else it will get your login name
               (resource name "<u>userName</u>").

       <b>-scoreFile</b> <u>filename</u>
               Specify an alternative score file (resource name "<u>scoreFile</u>").

       <b>-scores</b> This option lists all the recorded scores and then exits.

       <b>-version</b>
               This option tells you what version of xrubik you have.

</pre><h4><b>RECORDS</b></h4><pre>
       You must randomize the puzzle before a record is set, otherwise an assumption of cheating is made  if  it
       is solved after a get or an auto-solve.

</pre><h4><b>SAVE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here  is the format for the xrubik configuration, starting position, and the movement of its pieces.  The
       format is not standard.  The reason is that this is simple to produce and the  standard  notation  is  no
       good for variable number of pieces.

       Rubik2d with default colors, not randomized (front is face 2) :
         0       R     Red
       1 2 3   Y W G   Yellow, White, Green
         4       O     Orange
         5       B     Blue

              sizeX: 1-6 &lt;the number of cubes per row along x-axis&gt;
              sizeY: 1-6 &lt;the number of cubes per row along y-axis&gt;
              sizeZ: 1-6 &lt;the number of cubes per row along z-axis&gt;
              orient: 0-1 &lt;0 false, 1 true; if 1 then lines on pieces to be oriented&gt;
              practice: 0-1 &lt;0 false, 1 true&gt;
              moves: 0-MAXINT &lt;total number of moves&gt;

              startingPosition:  &lt;2  dimensional  array  of face and piece position, each face has size1 * size2
              pieces, if orient mode then orientation number follows face number: 0 up, 1 right, 2 down,  and  3
              left&gt;

       This is then followed by the moves, starting from 1.
              move #: &lt;direction&gt; &lt;control&gt; &lt;face&gt; &lt;position&gt;
       Each turn is with respect to a face and position.
       Position is 0 to size * size - 1.  Position 0 is in the upper left.
       Direction is represented as 0 up, 1 right, 2 down, 3 left, 5 clockwise, and 7 counterclockwise.
       Control is represented as 0 or 1, 1 if the whole cube is moved at once (here position does not matter), 0
       if not.  The xrubik record keeper does not count a control move as a move, but here we do.

       If  you have a Rubik's Cube you cannot solve (2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4) enter it in rubik.log file.  Have size
       = 2 or 3, orient = 0, practice = 0, randomized = 1, and moves = 0 and the number representation  for  the
       color  of the piece (usually 0=R, 1=Y, 2=W, 3=G, 4=O, 5=B).  Bring up xrubik, hit 'g' so it will get your
       configuration and then 's' to solve your cube and then 'w' to write out the  steps.   Then  examine  your
       rubik.log file.
