</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tuxmath - a math game for kids with Tux

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Tux,  of  Math  Command"  ("TuxMath,"  for  short) is an educational arcade game starring Tux, the Linux
       mascot!  Based on the classic arcade game "Missile Command," Tux must defend his cities.  In  this  case,
       though, he must do it by solving math problems.

       Use  the  number  keys on the keyboard to answer math equations, and then hit the space bar or enter.  If
       you don't answer a comet's math equation before it hits one of your igloos, the igloo  will  be  damaged.
       If  an  igloo  is  hit  twice, the penguin inside walks away.  When you lose all of your igloos, the game
       ends.

       There is also a "factoroids" game in which a ship destroys asteroids if you type a valid  factor  of  the
       number for a particular asteroid.  Use the number keys to steer.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Note:  most  settings  are  now  stored  in  a  config  file  named 'options' in a hidden directory named
       './tuxmath' within the user's home directory.  The file consists of simple name/value pairs. It  is  much
       easier  to  edit  this  file  to set game parameters than to use the command-line arguments listed below.
       Also, many options are not selectable from the command line. The config file contains extensive  comments
       detailing how to configure the behavior of Tuxmath.

       <b>--help</b> Display help for the command

       <b>--version</b>
              Display version and author information

       <b>--homedir</b> dirname
              seek  for  user  home  director(ies) in the specified location, rather than the user's actual home
              directory.  You can set up a user directory tree in this location (see README).   This  option  is
              especially useful for schools where all students log in with a single user name.

       <b>--optionfile</b> filename
              read  config  settings from named file. The locations searched for a file with a matching name are
              the current working directory, the absolute path of the filename,  tuxmath's  missions  directory,
              the user's tuxmath directory, and the user's home.

       <b>--playthroughlist</b>
              to ask each question only once, allowing player to win game if all questions successfully answered

       <b>--answersfirst</b>
              to ask questions in format: ? + num2 = num3 instead of default format: num1 + num2 = ?

       <b>--answersmiddle</b>
              to ask questions in format: num1 + ? = num3 instead of default format: num1 + num2 = ?

       <b>--nosound</b>
              to disable sound/music

       <b>--nobackground</b>
              to disable background photos (for slower systems)

       <b>--fullscreen</b>
              to run in fullscreen, if possible (vs. windowed)

       <b>--windowed</b>
              to run in a window rather than fullscreen

       <b>--keypad</b>
              to enable the on-sceen numeric keypad

       <b>--demo</b> to run the program as a cycling demonstration

       <b>--speed</b> S
              set initial speed of the game (S may be fractional, default is 1.0)

       <b>--allownegatives</b>
              to allow answers to be less than zero

       <b>--debug-X</b>
              prints debug information on command line.  X may be one of the following:
                  setup: debug messages only during initialization
                  fileops: file operations (loading and saving data)
                  loaders: loading of mulitmedia (images and sounds) titlescreen
                  menu: most operations dealing with menus
                  menu-parser: subset of operations dealing with menus
                  game: the comets game
                  factoroids: the factoroids game
                  lan: anything dealing with networking
                  mathcards: generation of math problems
                  sdl: the general graphical system
                  lessons: parsing pre-prepared lessons
                  highscore: loading and saving high scores
                  options: loading and saving options files
                  text-and-intl: text and internationalization
                  all: everything!
