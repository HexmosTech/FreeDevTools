</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       maze - an automated X11 demo repeatedly creating and solving a random maze

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>maze</b>  [--display  <u>host:display.screen</u>]  [--foreground  <u>color</u>]  [--background  <u>color</u>]  [--window] [--root]
       [--window-id <u>number</u>][--install] [--visual <u>visual</u>] [--grid-size <u>pixels</u>] [--live-color <u>color</u>] [--dead-color
       <u>color</u>] [--solve-delay <u>usecs</u>] [--pre-delay <u>usecs</u>] [--post-delay <u>usecs</u>] [--generator <u>integer</u>] [--max-length
       <u>integer</u>] [--fps]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>maze</u> program creates a "random" maze and then solves it with graphical feedback.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>maze</u> accepts the following options:

       <b>--window</b>
               Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       <b>--root</b>  Draw on the root window.

       <b>--window-id</b> <u>number</u>
               Draw on the specified window.

       <b>--install</b>
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       <b>--visual</b> <u>visual</u>
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a  visual  class,  or  the  id  number
               (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.

       <b>--grid-size</b> <u>pixels</u>
               The  size  of  each  block of the maze, in pixels; default is 0, meaning pick a random grid size.
               Minimum meaningful value is 2.

       <b>--live-color</b> <u>color</u>
               The color of the path.

       <b>--dead-color</b> <u>color</u>
               The color of the failed path (it is also stippled with a 50% pattern.)

       <b>--skip-color</b> <u>color</u>
               The maze solver will choose to not go down a path if it can "see" (in a straight line) that it is
               a dead end.  This is the color to use for paths that are skipped for this reason.

       <b>--surround-color</b> <u>color</u>
               If the maze solver ever completely encloses an area within the maze, then it knows that the  exit
               is  not  in  there  (and in fact the interior of that area might not even be reachable.)  It will
               mark out those cells using this color.

       <b>--solve-delay</b> <u>integer</u>
               Delay (in microseconds) between each step of the solution path.  Default 5000, or  about  1/200th
               second.

       <b>--pre-delay</b> <u>integer</u>
               Delay  (in  microseconds) between generating a maze and starting to solve it.  Default 2000000 (2
               seconds.)

       <b>--post-delay</b> <u>integer</u>
               Delay (in microseconds) after solving a maze and before generating a new one.  Default 4000000 (4
               seconds.)

       <b>--generator</b> <u>num</u>
               Sets the algorithm that will be used to generate the mazes. The default  is  -1,  which  randomly
               selects  an algorithm for each maze that is generated. Generator 0 is the original one, and works
               by walking around randomly until we hit a place we've been before, then backtracking and trying a
               new direction somewhere. Generator 1 picks a random spot in the maze, then draws a straight  wall
               from  that spot in a random direction until it hits another wall (and continues until the maze is
               complete). Generator 2 is based on sets. Initially all cells are  in  different  sets.  Then  two
               neighboring  cells  are  chosen and if they are in different sets, their sets are joined. If they
               were in the same set, a wall is built between them. This continues until the maze is complete.

               All generators generate mazes with a certain 'characteristic'. See if you can spot them!

               The three algorithms are essentially Kruskal, Prim, and a depth-first recursive backtracker.

       <b>--max-length</b> <u>num</u>
               Controls the maximum length of walls drawn in one go by generator 1.

       Clicking the mouse in the maze window controls it.

       <b>LeftButton</b>      Clears the window and restarts maze.

       <b>MiddleButton</b>    Pause or unpause the program.

       <b>RightButton</b>     Exit.

       <b>--fps</b>   Display the current frame rate and CPU load.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Expose events force a restart of maze.

       Mouse actions are based on "raw" values (Button1, Button2 and Button3) instead of using the pointer map.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> to get the default host and display number.

       <b>XENVIRONMENT</b>
               to get the  name  of  a  resource  file  that  overrides  the  global  resources  stored  in  the
               RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

       <b>XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW</b>
               The window ID to use with <u>--root</u>.
