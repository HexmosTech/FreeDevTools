</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       btanks - fast 2D tank arcade game

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Battle  Tanks  is  a  funny battle on your desk, where you can choose one of three vehicles and eliminate
       your enemy using the whole arsenal of weapons. has original cartoon-like graphics and cool music,  it  is
       fun and dynamic, it has several network modes for deathmatch and cooperative.

       what else is needed to have fun with your friends? And all is packed and ready for you in "Battle Tanks".

       Features:

       <b>Multiplayer</b>
              "Battle  Tanks"  is  a multiplayer game in the first place. Network game and split screen mode are
              available, and also a mixed mode is possible, when two players use  split  screen  on  the  server
              computer,  and  others  connect  via LAN.Two modes are possible: deathmatch battle and cooperative
              game.

       <b>Cross-platform</b>
              "Battle Tanks" is cross-platform. Both Windows and Linux fans are welcome on the battlefield where
              they will settle their quarrels in the name of weapons.

       <b>Free</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>source</b>
              The multiplayer version is licensed under GNU GPL. This means two things. Firstly, it doesn't cost
              anything for you. You can download it for free and share with your friends, with no preliminary or
              future fees. And secondly, the full source code of the game is available, so any guy who knows C++
              can poke his nose there and probably find some surprises that developers have prepared for curious
              fans.

       <b>Old-school</b> <b>oriented</b>
              Builders of "Battle Tanks" love these good old arcades of the past century.  So  they  have  tried
              hard to implement everything best of these old arcade games.

       Performance characteristics:

       <b>Three</b> <b>vehicles:</b> tank, Shilka, and rocket launcher. Each vehicle has its special features.

       <b>Lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons:</b> four types of ammo, six types of rockets, landing troops, mines, and so on.

       <b>Ten</b> <b>multiplayer</b> <b>maps</b> (seven ones for deathmatch and three ones for cooperative mode) in different
       locations such as city, village, forest, desert and so on.

       <b>Game</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>reacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>player.</b> Roads have traffic, buildings can be destroyed, weather effects are
       simulated.

       <b>Lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>objects:</b> troops, vehicles, helicopters and other.

       <b>Keyboard</b> <b>and</b> <b>gamepad</b> are supported.

</pre><h4><b>WEAPON</b> <b>LIST</b></h4><pre>
       1. Ammo

       Gun  is  the main weapon of tank and Shilka. Guns don't require ammunition, but their piercing ability is
       much lower that one for rockets.

       <b>"Eternal</b> <b>fire"</b> <b>type</b> <b>tank</b> <b>shell</b>
              Type shell that is shipped with tank and Shilka. The gun on Shilka is faster that one on tank, but
              each hit does less damage.  Guns have infinite ammunition.

       <b>Shell</b> <b>with</b> <b>laughset</b> <b>focal</b> <b>point</b>
              The main feature of the shell  with  laughset  focal  point  (also  called  shell  with  uncertain
              orientation)  is  bouncing from obstacles. This shell is good for urban battles, also it will help
              when shooting an enemy that has covered behind something solid or impenetrable.  The  disadvantage
              of this model is that you never know where it will bounce.

       <b>Explosive</b> <b>shell</b>
              The  explosive  shell  is  also known as Matreshka shell. Inside the jacket of this shell, several
              small shells are nested. A small time after the shot,  the  matreshka  opens,  and  nested  shells
              spread  in  different  directions.  Each  hit  causes  relatively  small damage, but large area is
              covered. This model is intended for use against enemy crowds. It is ineffective in close  face  to
              face duels.

       <b>Dirt</b> <b>gun</b>
              Dirt  gun  is invented by crazy agronomists. By the aid of concentration of energy in near-surface
              layers, nano-wave fluctuations cause temporary inversion of field. Lower layers are found  on  the
              top,  thus introducing a short-time effect of plowing the surface (this is broadly used during the
              sowing campaign). In battle,  the  dirt  gun  can  be  used  for  making  dirt  spots  of  reduced
              passability.  Enemy  troops  and  vehicles suffer loss of control and speed in these plowed areas.

       2. Rockets

       Rockets are large, so number of rockets that a vehicle carries is limited. Rockets  are  main  weapon  of
       rocket launcher.

       <b>Homing</b> <b>missile</b>
              Homing missile is a type weapon and is shipped with rocket launchers. It can also be used on tanks
              as  a  secondary  weapon. After the launch, the rocket finds a target and guides its flight by its
              own. Unlike the heat-aimed rockets, this model detects delta waves emitted by  human  brains,  and
              thus  can  be  used  against  troops  and manned vehicles. Unfortunately, this method of detection
              ignores androids and intellectually challenged individuals.  Another disadvantage is  that  rocket
              doesn't  avoid  obstacles  (avoiding  function  is  announced in the next stable release of rocket
              drivers binary).

       <b>Uncontrolled</b> <b>rocket</b>
              This is a Dumb-fire modification of the type rocket that can be equipped as a secondary weapon. At
              the expense of electronics, explosive charge and velocity are increased. Due to its high  velocity
              and high damage caused, this rocket is very good for making fire barriers, destroying enemy weapon
              emplacements, and in face to face battles.

       <b>Boomerang</b> <b>rocket</b>
              Boomerang  rocket  is  an  accidental modification of the homing missile that has been found after
              beta drivers were installed from a damaged CD on some test rocket. On ground  tests,  that  rocket
              introduced  a  non-typical behaviour: it didn't select a target after the launch, but just circled
              around the launcher, following an elliptical trajectory. Nobody can explain still why  the  rocket
              does that; however boomerang rockets have been approved and are produced on the line now. They can
              be used for defense; also boomerang rockets are effective in close battle.

       <b>Gas</b> <b>rocket</b>
              Gas rocket is stuffed with toxic and radioactive wastes of fragrance industry. They are prohibited
              by Geneva Protocol because of their incredibly disgusting and beautiful smell. A humanoid that has
              inhaled  the gas suffers convulsions, sialorrhea, retching, diarrhea, and dies with happy smile on
              face.  The gas rockets are perfect for eliminating troops. In multiplayer, they scan be  used  for
              making smoke screens.

       <b>Stop-rocket</b>
              This  homing  missile  is  filled with artificial viruses-malicious nanorobots. When a rocket hits
              target, viruses clod between tracks of tank caterpillars,  raise  pressure  of  braking  fluid  in
              hydraulic systems, and cause temporary paralysis of lower extremities of humanoids. However, these
              viruses don't affect functioning of weapons systems and other organs of humanoids; side effects or
              contra-indication  are  unknown.  Stop-rocket  does not inflict damage, but it's a great secondary
              weapon that is very effective if combined with explosive or bouncing tank shells, homing  missiles
              and machine guns.

       <b>Nuclear</b> <b>missile</b> <b>"Pure</b> <b>Thermonuke"</b>
              This  15 kilotons nuke is the most destructive weapon in the game. It destroys everything in range
              of explosion, and using or thermonuclear reaction guarantees  that  radiation  pollution  will  be
              negligibly  small.  So  the  ground  can  be used just after the enemy is vaporized by the heat of
              nuclear blast.  Secondary weapon

       3. Preserved landing force

       Five fully equipped troops are frozen and GZIPped into standard rectangular bricks. Before refrigeration,
       each trooper is prepared using special hormons and steroids, and  can  be  used  in  action  after  quick
       microwave-aided defreezing. Shipped in two versions with machine guns and handheld rocket launchers.

       <b>Machine</b> <b>gun</b> <b>trooper</b>
              The  trooper  takes  a position and fires the enemy objects (including missiles). 16 directions of
              fire are available.  Shilka lands MG troopers for support. Thanks to  their  high  fire  rate  and
              mobility, MG troopers can defend a vehicle against enemy missiles.

       <b>Rocket</b> <b>trooper</b>
              The trooper takes a position and fires the enemy objects (NOT including missiles). 8 directions of
              fire  are  available.  Shilka  lands  rocket troopers for support. Due to their fire power, rocket
              troopers are good for attacking the enemy.

       4. Other weapons

       Other weapons include mines and MG turrets.  Mine

       <b>Mine</b>   Mines are effective equally against troops and vehicles. They have  winning  appearance,  and  are
              easy  to  install and use.  Using of mines allows unique and great tactical opportunities, both in
              single missions and deathmatch. Routes, respawn points, hidings of weapons  -  everything  can  be
              mined. Remember that the mine is invisible if covered with dirt or smoke!

       <b>MG</b> <b>turret</b>
              MG  turret  is  a  primitive robot that shoots everything that is moving. Some turrets are shipped
              with "ally-enemy" recognition system. In stationary version, MG turrets can be used for  automated
              security  systems.  Mobile  versions can be mounted on rocket launchers. 16 directions of fire are
              available.
