</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       xzip - X Interface to the Z-code Interpreter

</pre><h4><b>Syntax</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xzip</b> [ <u>options</u> <u>...</u>  ] <u>gamefile</u>

       The  list of options is described below. The <u>gamefile</u> should be the filename of a Z-code file or a PICKLE
       archive containing a Z-code file.

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xzip</u> is a clean X Windows interface to games written in Infocom's Z-code game format. It  handles  Z-code
       versions 1 through 5, plus the newer version 8.

       The  interface is heavily (well, completely) based on ATK, an X toolkit developed at CMU. Really, I would
       have preferred to actually do this in ATK... except that then you'd need ATK to run  it,  and  that's  50
       <u>megabytes</u> of source code. (Honest.) So I just did an imitation.

</pre><h4><b>Mouse</b> <b>Commands</b></h4><pre>
       In the text window:

       <b>Left-click</b> to move the dot to the mouse location.
       <b>Click-and-drag</b> to select a large region.
       <b>Right-click</b> to extend the selection to the mouse location.
       <b>Double-clicking</b> selects a word (or extends the selection one word at a time).

       In the scroll bar:

       <b>Left-click</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrows</b> to scroll to the top or bottom.
       <b>Right-click</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrows</b> to scroll up or down one line.
       <b>Click-and-drag</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> will scroll up and down smoothly.
       <b>Left-click</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>(without</b> <b>dragging)</b> will scroll down by an amount controlled by where in the bar you
       click.  The farther down the bar, the more it scrolls. This is computed so that if you left-click next to
       a line, that line scrolls to the top of the screen.
       <b>Right-click</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>(without</b> <b>dragging)</b> will scroll up in a similar manner. The top  line  will  scroll
       down to where you clicked.

</pre><h4><b>Key</b> <b>Commands</b></h4><pre>
       The  key commands will be familiar to Emacs users.  <u>meta-</u> combinations can be used either by holding down
       the <u>meta</u> key (possibly labelled <u>alt</u> or something else) or by pressing <u>escape</u> before the desired key.

       The commands listed below are the defaults. They can be customized with  the  <u>bindings</u>  X  resource  (see
       below.) &lt;none&gt; indicates a function which by default is not bound to any key.

       <b>ctrl-f</b> <u>(forward-char)</u> Move dot forward one character.
       <b>ctrl-b</b> <u>(backward-char)</u> Move dot backward one character.
       <b>meta-f</b> <u>(forward-word)</u> Move dot forward one word.
       <b>meta-b</b> <u>(backward-word)</u> Move dot backward one word.
       <b>ctrl-a</b> <u>(beginning-of-line)</u> Move dot to beginning of line.
       <b>ctrl-e</b> <u>(end-of-line)</u> Move dot to end of line.

       <b>PageDown,</b> <b>ctrl-v</b> <u>(scroll-down)</u> Scroll down one page.
       <b>PageUp,</b> <b>meta-v</b> <u>(scroll-up)</u> Scroll up one page.

       <b>delete</b> <u>(delete-char)</u> Delete character before the dot.
       <b>ctrl-d</b> <u>(delete-next-char)</u> Delete character after the dot.
       <b>meta-delete</b> <u>(delete-word)</u> Delete word before the dot.
       <b>meta-d</b> <u>(delete-next-word)</u> Delete word after the dot.

       <b>ctrl-w</b> <u>(kill-region)</u> Cut selection to cut buffer.
       <b>meta-w</b> <u>(copy-region)</u> Copy selection to cut buffer.
       <b>ctrl-y</b> <u>(yank)</u> Copy the cut buffer in at the dot.
       <b>ctrl-k</b> <u>(kill-line)</u> Cut from dot to end of line into the cut buffer.
       <b>ctrl-u</b> <u>(kill-input)</u> Cut all text typed so far into the cut buffer.

       <b>UpArrow,</b> <b>meta-=</b> <u>(backward-history)</u> Move back one line in command history buffer.
       <b>DownArrow,</b> <b>meta-`</b> <u>(forward-history)</u> Move back one line in command history buffer.

       <b>meta-0...meta-9</b>  <u>(macro)</u>  Insert  a  macro  string  at  the  dot. By default, all macros are undefined at
       startup, but you can change this with the <u>bindings</u> option.
       <b>meta-r</b> <u>(define-macro)</u> The next macro key hit will be redefined to  be  the  selection.  If  there  is  no
       selection, or if the next key hit is not a macro key, an error is displayed.

       <b>ctrl-l</b> <u>(redraw-all-windows)</u> Redraw text and status windows.
       &lt;none&gt; <u>(redraw-status)</u> Redraw status window.
       &lt;none&gt; <u>(redraw-screen)</u> Redraw text window.
       <b>meta-z</b> <u>(zoom-status)</u> Expand status window to maximum size (only when the <u>autoresize</u> option is on.)
       <b>meta-s</b> <u>(shrink-status)</u> Shrink status window to minimum size (only when the <u>autoresize</u> option is on.)
       <b>meta-c</b> <u>(clear-status)</u> Clear any extra text below the status line in the status window.

       <b>Enter,</b> <b>Return</b> <u>(enter)</u> Accept the text that has been typed.
       <b>Escape</b> <u>(escape)</u> Set escape mode; next key hit will be taken as a <u>meta</u> key.
       <b>ctrl-g</b> <u>(cancel)</u> Cancel escape mode, and anything else that's going on.
       <b>Help,</b> <b>ctrl-_</b> <u>(explain-key)</u> Explain the next key hit; this displays the function that the key is bound to,
       and its argument, if any.
       <b>All</b> <b>normal</b> <b>keys</b> <u>(insert-self)</u> Insert whatever key is bound to this at the dot.
       &lt;none&gt; <u>(no-op)</u> Do nothing. Bind a key to this to disable it.

</pre><h4><b>Resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       All  the  behavior of <u>xzip</u> is controlled by X resources and command-line options. Any particular behavior
       can be set with either a resource or an option; options override resources.

       Command-line options go on the command line, looking like,
       <u>xzip</u> <u>-option</u> <u>value</u> <u>gamefile</u>
       Note that even binary options like "justify" must be given a value, "yes" or "no".

       Resources are usually placed in your <u>.Xdefaults</u> or <u>Xresources</u> file, depending on your system setup.  They
       have the format
       <u>xzip.resourcename:</u> <u>value</u>

       These are the resources and options that you can currently set. The default values are in italics.

       <b>geometry:</b> <u>500x600+100+100</u>
              The geometry of the text window, in the usual X geometry format.

       <b>statgeometry:</b> <u>80x24+100+50</u>
              The  geometry  of  the  status  window.  Note that the size is given in characters, not in pixels,
              although the position is still in pixels. This makes it something of a pain to position it in  the
              right or bottom sides of the screen.

       <b>foreground:</b> <u>black</u>
              The color of the text and other window decorations.

       <b>background:</b> <u>white</u>
              The color of the window background.

       <b>greycolor:</b> <u>grey60</u>
              An intermediate color, used for the scroll bar on color displays.

       <b>justify:</b> <u>yes</u>
              If "yes", full-justify the text in the text window.

       <b>marginx:</b> <u>4</u>
              Width (in pixels) of the margin between the left edge of the text and the scroll bar.

       <b>leading:</b> <u>3</u>
              Width (in pixels) of extra space to put between lines of text.

       <b>autoresize:</b> <u>yes</u>
              If  "yes", the status window will automatically resize to be just big enough for the game's status
              line. (But see "Quirks", below.)

       <b>resizeupward:</b> <u>no</u>
              If "no", the status window will resize downward; the top edge will stay in place, and  the  bottom
              edge  will  move.  If  "yes", it will resize upward. At the moment, this doesn't work very well at
              all. (See "Known Bugs", below.)

       <b>autoclear:</b> <u>yes</u>
              If "yes", extraneous text in the status window will be cleared  after  one  turn.  (See  "Quirks",
              below.)

       <b>history:</b> <u>20</u>
              The number of commands to store in the command history.

       <b>buffer:</b> <u>4000</u>
              The  amount  of  text (in characters) to keep in the scrollback buffer. If this is made too large,
              the program can become very slow.

       <b>strictz:</b> <u>1</u>
              The level of reporting of various subtle errors in the game file. 0  means  that  all  errors  are
              silently  ignored;  1  (the default) means that each error is reported, but only the first time it
              occurs; 2 means that each error is reported every time it occurs; 3  means  that  the  interpreter
              will shut down immediately when an error occurs.

       <b>spec:</b> <u>no</u>
              If  "yes",  the  interpreter  will declare itself to be compliant with the Z-machine Specification
              version 1.0. This is, basically, a lie, since I have not formally reviewed the source for Spec-1.0
              compliance. However, <u>xzip</u> does support every Spec-1.0 feature that I know of, except for the color
              and Unicode options.

       <b>inputstyle:</b> <u>b</u>
              The style to display your typed input in. This can be <u>n</u> for normal text, or <u>r,</u> <u>b,</u> <u>rb,</u> <u>i,</u>  <u>ri,</u>  <u>bi,</u>
              <u>rbi,</u>  <u>f,</u>  <u>rf,</u> <u>bf,</u> <u>rbf,</u> <u>if,</u> <u>rif,</u> <u>bif,</u> <u>rbif</u> to specify any combination of Reverse, Bold, Italic, and
              Fixed. Note that the letters must be in the order shown; you cannot use <u>ib</u> to specify  italic  and
              bold.

       <b>X-color:</b>  <u>(same</u> <u>as</u> <u>foreground)</u>
              X  may be any of <u>n,</u> <u>r,</u> <u>b,</u> <u>rb,</u> <u>i,</u> <u>ri,</u> <u>bi,</u> <u>rbi,</u> <u>f,</u> <u>rf,</u> <u>bf,</u> <u>rbf,</u> <u>if,</u> <u>rif,</u> <u>bif,</u> <u>rbif.</u>  This allows you
              to specify the color of any of the sixteen fonts used by <u>xzip.</u>  For non-reversed  fonts,  this  is
              the  color  of  the  text;  for  reversed fonts, it is the color of the field on which the text is
              displayed. (The text of reversed fonts is always in the background color.)

       <b>X-font:</b>
              X may be any of <u>n,</u> <u>b,</u> <u>i,</u> <u>bi,</u> <u>f,</u> <u>bf,</u> <u>if,</u> <u>bif.</u>  This allows you to specify the sixteen fonts used by
              <u>xzip.</u>  (Note that you cannot set the reversed fonts; they always use the same font as  their  non-
              reversed counterparts.)
              The status window always uses the fixed-width fonts; the text window usually (but not always) uses
              proportional fonts.

       <b>bindings:</b> <u>(see</u> <u>above)</u>
              Key bindings to supplement or override the default bindings. The resource should look like
              <u>key=function</u> <u>[,</u> <u>argument</u> <u>];</u> <u>key=function</u> <u>[,</u> <u>argument</u> <u>]</u> <u>...</u>
              where <u>key</u> is the name of a key, preceded by <u>c-</u> to indicate a control key and <u>m-</u> to indicate a meta
              key.   <u>function</u>  should  be  one of the function names listed in parentheses in the "Key Bindings"
              section.  <u>argument</u> (which is optional) should be a quoted string  which  will  be  passed  to  the
              function. Currently, only the <u>macro</u> function takes an argument.
              So, for example,
              <u>xzip.bindings:</u> <u>c-x=kill-input;</u> <u>m-i=macro,"inventory";</u> <u>m-d=no-op</u>
              would  mean  that  <u>ctrl-x</u> will delete all input, and <u>meta-i</u> will enter the string "inventory", and
              <u>meta-d</u> will do nothing. You can have more than one key bound to a function, but you can only  have
              one function bound to a key; later bindings will override earlier ones.

       Ok,  I  lied;  there's one behavior which is set by an environment variable. If you set INFOCOM_PATH to a
       directory or colon-separated list of directories, <u>xzip</u> will look there for a story  file  if  it  doesn't
       find it in the current directory.

</pre><h4><b>Quirks</b></h4><pre>
       As  always,  if you highlight colored text, the result may be surprising. Highlighting "normal" text will
       be fine, and any other fonts which are the same color, but other colors may highlight  in  strange  ways,
       and  could  be hard to read. (This is only a problem for text which is highlighted because it's selected.
       Text in a reverse font looks correct.)

       Certain games (notably <u>Trinity</u> and <u>Curses!</u>)  display pop-up windows,  by  using  the  status  line  in  a
       slightly  funky  way.  They  expand  the  status line, display some text, and then immediately shrink the
       status line again.
       I have done my best to support this in <u>xzip</u> ´s two-window system. The pop-up window will be visible  from
       when  it  is created until the first time you hit <u>Return.</u>  Then the status window will shrink again. This
       gives you one "turn" to read the pop-up,  which  should  be  sufficient.  (In  one-window,  non-scrolling
       interpreters, the pop-up appears over your old text, and scrolls away as you continue play.)
       If  you turn off the <u>autoclear</u> option, pop-ups will not be erased; use <u>meta-z</u> to expand the status window
       and read them after the window shrinks, and <u>meta-c</u> to erase them manually. If you do not erase  the  pop-
       up, a later pop-up may partially overwrite it, which looks ugly.
       If  you  turn  off the <u>autoshrink</u> option, the status window will not shrink, but the pop-up will still be
       erased (unless you have turned off <u>autoclear</u> as well.)

</pre><h4><b>Known</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       The "resizeupward" preference just plain doesn't work. If you use it, the status window will slowly drift
       downwards as it resizes.
       If a timed input (such as <u>Border</u> <u>Zone</u> uses) expires while you are editing a line, the dot  jumps  to  the
       end of the line.
       If  a  style  change  occurs in the middle of a word, <u>xzip</u> thinks it's okay to break the word there (when
       wrapping lines.)
       Reverse text has gaps in it in full-justified lines. It also has gaps between lines, in the text window.
       The keybindings are ignored while <u>xzip</u> is waiting for a single keystroke (as opposed to a line of input.)
       <u>ctrl-l</u> is hardwired to work, but any other key will just be taken literally.
       Scrolling is slow and awful on X servers without backing store.
       Ignores meta modifier on special keyboard keys (Home, PageUp, etc)
       Parsing of keys in bindings could be cleverer. It ought to understand /123 octal notation at least.
       Ought to have separate font and color prefs for the status window.
       Sometimes makes you place a window by hand, even though the geometry is specified.
