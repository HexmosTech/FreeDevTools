</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lightyears</b> is a strategy game with steampunk elements. You are the ruler of a new city on an alien planet
       and  you  have  to provide it with energy to let it advance. To achieve this you have to construct "Steam
       Makers" and connect them through pipes and nodes.

       Ensuring a stable and plentiful steam supply will let  you  upgrade  your  city.   This  will  result  in
       additional  "work  units"  which  will allow you to do a higher amount of simultaneous construction work.
       Other than constructing "Steam Makers", nodes and pipes, you can also upgrade  those  to  increase  their
       efficiency.

       To  make  your  task  more  difficult there are atural phenomenons that may harm part of your network, in
       which case you will have to repair it in hurry before the city loses too much energy. You'll also have to
       face enemy alien ships, of increasing power as the game advances, which  will  attempt  to  destroy  your
       infraestructures.
