</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       crispy-strife - historically compatible Strife engine

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>crispy-strife</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Crispy  Strife  is  an  accurate  and complete recreation of Rogue Entertainment's "Strife: Quest for the
       Sigil". It was created through more than two years of reverse engineering effort with  the  blessings  of
       the original programmers of the game (see the section HISTORY below).

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-donut</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b> <b>&lt;y&gt;</b>
              Use  the  specified magic values when emulating behavior caused by memory overruns from improperly
              constructed donuts. In Vanilla Strife this can differ depending  on  the  operating  system.   The
              default  (if  this  option is not specified) is to emulate the behavior when running under Windows
              98.

       <b>-gameversion</b> <b>&lt;version&gt;</b>
              Emulate a specific version of Strife. Valid values are "1.2" and "1.31".

</pre><h4><b>IWAD</b> <b>SEARCH</b> <b>PATHS</b></h4><pre>
       To play, an IWAD file is needed. This is a large file containing  all  of  the  levels,  graphics,  sound
       effects,  music and other material that make up the game. IWAD files are named according to the game; the
       standard names are:

       <b>doom.wad,</b> <b>doom1.wad,</b> <b>doom2.wad,</b> <b>tnt.wad,</b> <b>plutonia.wad</b>
              Doom, Doom II, Final Doom

       <b>heretic.wad,</b> <b>heretic1.wad,</b> <b>hexen.wad,</b> <b>strife1.wad</b>
              Heretic, Hexen and Strife (commercial Doom engine games).

       <b>hacx.wad,</b> <b>chex.wad</b>
              Hacx and Chex Quest - more obscure games based on the Doom engine.

       <b>freedm.wad,</b> <b>freedoom1.wad,</b> <b>freedoom2.wad</b>
              The Freedoom open content IWAD files.

       The following directory paths are searched in order to find an IWAD:

       <b>Current</b> <b>working</b> <b>directory</b>
              Any IWAD files found in the current working directory will be used in preference to IWADs found in
              any other directories.

       <b>DOOMWADDIR</b>
              This environment variable can be set to contain a path to a single directory in which to look  for
              IWAD files. This environment variable is supported by most Doom source ports.

       <b>DOOMWADPATH</b>
              This  environment  variable, if set, can contain a colon-separated list of directories in which to
              look for IWAD files, or alternatively full paths to specific IWAD files.

       <b>$HOME/.local/share/games/doom</b>
              Writeable directory  in  the  user's  home  directory.  The  path  can  be  overridden  using  the
              <b>XDG_DATA_HOME</b> environment variable (see the XDG Base Directory Specification).

       <b>/usr/local/share/doom,</b> <b>/usr/local/share/games/doom,</b> <b>/usr/share/doom,</b>
              /usr/share/games/doom  System-wide  locations  that  can  be  accessed  by  all  users.  The  path
              <b>/usr/share/games/doom</b> is a standard path that is supported by most Doom source ports. These  paths
              can  be  overridden  using  the  <b>XDG_DATA_DIRS</b>  environment  variable  (see the XDG Base Directory
              Specification).

       The above can be overridden on a one-time basis by using the <b>-iwad</b> command line parameter to provide  the
       path  to an IWAD file to use. This parameter can also be used to specify the name of a particular IWAD to
       use from one of the above paths. For example, '<b>-iwad</b> <b>doom.wad</b>' will search the above paths for  the  file
       <b>doom.wad</b> to use.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes environment variables that control Crispy Strife's behavior.

       <b>DOOMWADDIR</b>, <b>DOOMWADPATH</b>
              See the section, <b>IWAD</b> <b>SEARCH</b> <b>PATHS</b> above.

       <b>PCSOUND_DRIVER</b>
              When  running  in  PC  speaker sound effect mode, this environment variable specifies a PC speaker
              driver to use for sound effect playback.  Valid options are "Linux" for  the  Linux  console  mode
              driver,  "BSD"  for  the  NetBSD/OpenBSD  PC  speaker  driver, and "SDL" for SDL-based emulated PC
              speaker playback (using the digital output).

       <b>OPL_DRIVER</b>
              When using OPL MIDI playback, this environment variable specifies an OPL backend  driver  to  use.
              Valid  options  are  "SDL"  for  an  SDL-based  software  emulated OPL chip, "Linux" for the Linux
              hardware OPL driver, and "OpenBSD" for the OpenBSD/NetBSD hardware OPL driver.

              Generally speaking, a real hardware OPL chip  sounds  better  than  software  emulation;  however,
              modern  machines  do  not often include one. If present, it may still require extra work to set up
              and elevated security privileges to access.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$HOME/.local/share/crispy-doom/strife.cfg</b>
              The main configuration file for Crispy Strife.  See <b><a href="../man5/strife.cfg.5.html">strife.cfg</a></b>(5).

       <b>$HOME/.local/share/crispy-doom/crispy-strife.cfg</b>
              Extra configuration values that are specific to Crispy Strife and not present in  Vanilla  Strife.
              See <b><a href="../man5/crispy-strife.cfg.5.html">crispy-strife.cfg</a></b>(5).

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man6/crispy-doom.6.html">crispy-doom</a></b>(6), <b><a href="../man6/crispy-server.6.html">crispy-server</a></b>(6), <b><a href="../man6/crispy-setup.6.html">crispy-setup</a></b>(6)

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The  source  code  for  Strife  was lost, which means, unlike the code for all the other commercial DOOM-
       engine games, it cannot be released. The only access we have to the code is the binary  executable  file.
       Reverse  engineering  tools were employed to disassemble and decompile the executables, which were cross-
       referenced against the Linux DOOM and DOS Heretic sources and painstakingly combed over  multiple  times,
       instruction-by-instruction,  to  ensure that the resulting Chocolate-Doom-based executable is as close as
       possible to the original.

</pre><h4><b>LEGALITY</b></h4><pre>
       Reverse engineering is a protected activity so long as the original code is  not  used  directly  in  the
       product.  Due  to the vast amount of information lost through the process of compilation, and the need to
       refactor large portions of code in order to eliminate non-portable idioms or to adapt  them  properly  to
       Chocolate Doom's framework, the resulting code behaves the same, but is not the *same* code.

       In  addition, James Monroe and John Carmack have both stated that they have no objections to the project.
       Because they are the original authors of the code, and neither Rogue nor their publisher, Velocity, Inc.,
       exist any longer as legal entities, this is effectively legal permission.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Crispy Strife is almost, but not entirely perfect, in recreating the behavior of Vanilla Strife.  Help us
       by reporting any discrepancies you might notice between this executable and the vanilla DOS program.

       However, do *not* report any glitch that you can replicate in the vanilla EXE as  a  bug.  The  point  of
       Crispy  Strife,  like  Chocolate  Doom  before  it,  is to be as bug-compatible with the original game as
       possible. Also be aware that some glitches are impossible to compatibly recreate, and  wherever  this  is
       the  case,  Crispy  Strife has erred on the side of not crashing the program, for example by initializing
       pointers to NULL rather than using them without setting a value first.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       Chocolate Strife is part of the Chocolate Doom project. It was reverse engineered from the  DOS  versions
       of  Strife  by  James  Haley  and  Samuel Villarreal.  Chocolate Doom was written and maintained by Simon
       Howard, and is based on the LinuxDoom source code released by Id Software.
