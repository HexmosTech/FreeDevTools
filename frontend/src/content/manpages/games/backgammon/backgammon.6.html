</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       backgammon — the game of backgammon
       teachgammon — learn to play backgammon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>backgammon</b> [<b>-</b>] [<b>-nrwb</b>] [<b>-pr</b>] [<b>-pw</b>] [<b>-pb</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>term</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>file</u>]
       <b>teachgammon</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program lets you play backgammon against the computer or against a "friend".  All commands are only
       one letter, so you don't need to type a carriage return, except at the end of a  move.   The  program  is
       mostly  self-explanatory, so that a question mark (?) will usually get some help.  If you answer `y' when
       the program asks if you want the rules, you will get text explaining the rules of the game, some hints on
       strategy, instructions on how to use the program, and a tutorial consisting of a  practice  game  against
       the  computer.   A description of how to use the program can be obtained by answering `y' when it asks if
       you want instructions.

       The possible arguments for backgammon (most are unnecessary but some are very convenient) consist of:

       <b>-n</b>      don't ask for rules or instructions

       <b>-r</b>      player is red (implies n)

       <b>-w</b>      player is white (implies n)

       <b>-b</b>      two players, red and white (implies n)

       <b>-pr</b>     print the board before red's turn

       <b>-pw</b>     print the board before white's turn

       <b>-pb</b>     print the board before both player's turn

       <b>-t</b> <u>term</u>
               terminal is type <u>term</u>, uses <u>/usr/share/misc/termcap</u>

       <b>-s</b> <u>file</u>
               recover previously saved game from <u>file</u>

       Any unrecognized arguments are ignored.  An argument of  a  lone  `-'  gets  a  description  of  possible
       arguments.

       If <u>term</u> has capabilities for direct cursor movement (see <u><a href="../man5/termcap.5.html">termcap</a></u>(5)) <b>backgammon</b> ``fixes'' the board after
       each  move, so the board does not need to be reprinted, unless the screen suffers some horrendous malady.
       Also, any `p' option will be ignored.  (The `t' option is not necessary unless the terminal type does not
       match the entry in the <u>/usr/share/misc/termcap</u> data base.)

</pre><h4><b>QUICK</b> <b>REFERENCE</b></h4><pre>
       When the program prompts by typing only your color, type a space or carriage return to roll, or

       <b>d</b>       to double

       <b>p</b>       to print the board

       <b>q</b>       to quit

       <b>s</b>       to save the game for later

       When the program prompts with 'Move:', type

       <b>p</b>       to print the board

       <b>q</b>       to quit

       <b>s</b>       to save the game

       or a <u>move</u>, which is a sequence of

       <b>s-f</b>     move from <b>s</b> to <b>f</b>

       <b>s/r</b>     move one man on <b>s</b> the roll <b>r</b> separated by commas or spaces and ending with a newline.   Available
               abbreviations are

               <b>s-f1-f2</b>
                       means <b>s-f1,f1-f2</b>

               <b>s/r1r2</b>  means <b>s/r1,s/r2</b>

       Use <b>b</b> for bar and <b>h</b> for home, or 0 or 25 as appropriate.
