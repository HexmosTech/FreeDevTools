</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       atc — air traffic controller game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>atc</b> [<b>-u?lstp</b>] [<b>-gf</b> <u>game</u> <u>name</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>random</u> <u>seed</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>atc</b> lets you try your hand at the nerve wracking duties of the air traffic controller without endangering
       the  lives of millions of travelers each year.  Your responsibilities require you to direct the flight of
       jets and prop planes into and out of the  flight  arena  and  airports.   The  speed  (update  time)  and
       frequency of the planes depend on the difficulty of the chosen arena.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-u</b>    Print the usage line and exit.

       <b>-?</b>    Same as <b>-u</b>.

       <b>-l</b>    Print a list of available games and exit.  The first game name printed is the default game.

       <b>-s</b>    Print the score list (formerly the Top Ten list).

       <b>-t</b>    Same as <b>-s</b>.

       <b>-p</b>    Print  the path to the special directory where <b>atc</b> expects to find its private files.  This is used
             during the installation of the program.

       <b>-g</b> <u>game</u>
             Play the named game.  If the game listed is not one of the ones printed from  the  <b>-l</b>  option,  the
             default game is played.

       <b>-f</b> <u>game</u>
             Same as <b>-g</b>.

       <b>-r</b> <u>seed</u>
             Set the random seed.  The purpose of this flag is questionable.

</pre><h4><b>GOALS</b></h4><pre>
       Your  goal  in  <b>atc</b>  is to keep the game going as long as possible.  There is no winning state, except to
       beat the times of other players.  You will need to: launch planes at airports  (by  instructing  them  to
       increase  their  altitude);  land  planes  at  airports  (by instructing them to go to altitude zero when
       exactly over the airport); and maneuver planes out of exit points.

       Several things will cause the end of the game.  Each plane has a destination (see information area),  and
       sending  a  plane  to  the  wrong  destination  is an error.  Planes can run out of fuel, or can collide.
       Collision is defined as adjacency in all three dimensions.  A plane leaving the arena in  any  other  way
       than through its destination exit is an error as well.

       Scores  are  sorted  in order of the number of planes safe.  The other statistics are provided merely for
       fun.  There is no penalty for taking longer than another player (except in the case of ties).

       Suspending a game is not permitted.  If you get a talk message, tough.  When was the  last  time  an  Air
       Traffic Controller got called away to the phone?

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>DISPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       Depending on the terminal you run <b>atc</b> on, the screen will be divided into 4 areas.  It should be stressed
       that the terminal driver portion of the game was designed to be reconfigurable, so the display format can
       vary  depending  on the version you are playing.  The descriptions here are based on the ascii version of
       the game.  The game rules and input format, however, should remain  consistent.   Control-L  redraws  the
       screen, should it become muddled.

   <b>RADAR</b>
       The  first  screen  area  is  the  radar display, showing the relative locations of the planes, airports,
       standard entry/exit points, radar beacons, and ``lines'' which simply serve to aid  you  in  guiding  the
       planes.

       Planes  are shown as a single letter with an altitude.  If the numerical altitude is a single digit, then
       it represents thousands of feet.  Some distinction is made between the prop  planes  and  the  jets.   On
       ascii terminals, prop planes are represented by a upper case letter, jets by a lower case letter.

       Airports  are  shown as a number and some indication of the direction planes must be going to land at the
       airport.  On ascii terminals, this is one of `^', `&gt;', `&lt;', and `v', to indicate north (0 degrees),  east
       (90), west (270) and south (180), respectively.  The planes will also take off in this direction.

       Beacons  are represented as circles or asterisks and a number.  Their purpose is to offer a place of easy
       reference to the plane pilots.  See “THE DELAY COMMAND” section below.

       Entry/exit points are displayed as numbers along the border of the radar screen.  Planes will  enter  the
       arena  from these points without warning.  These points have a direction associated with them, and planes
       will always enter the arena from this direction.  On the ascii version of  <b>atc</b>,  this  direction  is  not
       displayed.  It will become apparent what this direction is as the game progresses.

       Incoming  planes  will  always enter at the same altitude: 7000 feet.  For a plane to successfully depart
       through an entry/exit point, it must be flying at 9000 feet.  It is not necessary for the  planes  to  be
       flying in any particular direction when they leave the arena (yet).

   <b>INFORMATION</b> <b>AREA</b>
       The  second  area  of  the display is the information area, which lists the time (number of updates since
       start), and the number of planes you have directed safely out of the arena.  Below  this  is  a  list  of
       planes  currently  in  the  air,  followed  by  a blank line, and then a list of planes on the ground (at
       airports).  Each line lists the plane name and its current altitude, an optional asterisk indicating  low
       fuel,  the  plane's destination, and the plane's current command.  Changing altitude is not considered to
       be a command and is therefore not displayed.  The following are some possible information lines:

             B4*A0: Circle @ b1
             g7 E4: 225

       The first example shows a prop plane named `B' that is flying at 4000 feet.  It is low on fuel (note  the
       `*').  Its destination is Airport #0.  The next command it expects to do is circle when it reaches Beacon
       #1.   The  second  example  shows  a  jet  named  `g' at 7000 feet, destined for Exit #4.  It is just now
       executing a turn to 225 degrees (South-West).

   <b>INPUT</b> <b>AREA</b>
       The third area of the display is the input area.  It is here that  your  input  is  reflected.   See  the
       “INPUT” heading of this manual for more details.

   <b>AUTHOR</b> <b>AREA</b>
       This area is used simply to give credit where credit is due. :-)

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b></h4><pre>
       A  command completion interface is built into the game.  At any time, typing `?' will list possible input
       characters.  Typing a backspace (your erase character) backs up, erasing the last part  of  the  command.
       When  a  command  is complete, a return enters it, and any semantic checking is done at that time.  If no
       errors are detected, the command is sent to the appropriate plane.  If an error is discovered during  the
       check,  the offending statement will be underscored and a (hopefully) descriptive message will be printed
       under it.

       The command syntax is broken into two parts: <u>Immediate</u>  <u>Only</u>  and  <u>Delayable</u>  commands.   <u>Immediate</u>  <u>Only</u>
       commands  happen  on  the next update.  <u>Delayable</u> commands also happen on the next update unless they are
       followed by an optional predicate called the <u>Delay</u> command.

       In the following tables, the syntax <u>[0-9]</u> means any single digit, and ⟨<u>dir</u>⟩ refers to a direction,  given
       by  the  keys  around the `s' key: ``wedcxzaq''.  In absolute references, `q' refers to North-West or 315
       degrees, and `w' refers to North, or 0 degrees.  In relative references, `q' refers to -45 degrees or  45
       degrees left, and `w' refers to 0 degrees, or no change in direction.

       All commands start with a plane letter.  This indicates the recipient of the command.  Case is ignored.

   <b>IMMEDIATE</b> <b>ONLY</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       a [ cd+- ] <u>number</u>
             Altitude:  Change a plane's altitude, possibly requesting takeoff.  `+' and `-' are the same as `c'
             and `d'.
             a <u>number</u>    Climb or descend to the given altitude (in thousands of feet).
             ac <u>number</u>   Climb: relative altitude change.
             ad <u>number</u>   Descend: relative altitude change.

       m     Mark: Display in highlighted mode.  Plane and command information is displayed normally.

       i     Ignore: Do not display highlighted.  Command is displayed as a  line  of  dashes  if  there  is  no
             command.

       u     Unmark:  Same as ignore, but if a delayed command is processed, the plane will become marked.  This
             is useful if you want to forget about a plane during part, but not all, of its journey.

   <b>DELAYABLE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       c [ lr ]
             Circle: Have the plane circle.
             cl          Left: Circle counterclockwise.
             cr          Right: Circle clockwise (default).

       t [ l-r+LR ] [ dir ] or tt [ abe* ] <u>number</u>
             Turn: Change direction.
             t&lt;dir&gt;      Turn to direction: Turn to the absolute compass heading given.  The shortest turn  will
                         be taken.
             tl [ dir ]  Left:  Turn  counterclockwise:  45 degrees by default, or the amount specified in ⟨dir⟩
                         (not <u>to</u> ⟨dir⟩.)  `w' (0 degrees) is no turn.  `e' is 45 degrees; `q' gives -45  degrees
                         counterclockwise, that is, 45 degrees clockwise.
             t- [ dir ]  Same as left.
             tr [ dir ]  Right: Turn clockwise, 45 degrees by default, or the amount specified in ⟨dir⟩.
             t+ [ dir ]  Same as right.
             tL          Hard left: Turn counterclockwise 90 degrees.
             tR          Hard right: Turn clockwise 90 degrees.
             tt [abe*]   Towards: Turn towards a beacon, airport or exit.  The turn is just an estimate.
             tta <u>number</u>  Turn towards the given airport.
             ttb <u>number</u>  Turn towards the specified beacon.
             tte <u>number</u>  Turn towards an exit.
             tt* <u>number</u>  Same as ttb.

   <b>THE</b> <b>DELAY</b> <b>COMMAND</b>
       The <u>Delay</u> (a/@) command may be appended to any <u>Delayable</u> command.  It allows the controller to instruct a
       plane to do an action when the plane reaches a particular beacon (or other objects in future versions).

       ab <u>number</u>
             Do  the  delayable  command when the plane reaches the specified beacon.  The `b' for ``beacon'' is
             redundant to allow for expansion.  `@' can be used instead of `a'.

   <b>MARKING,</b> <b>UNMARKING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>IGNORING</b>
       Planes are <u>marked</u> by default when they enter the arena.  This means they  are  displayed  in  highlighted
       mode on the radar display.  A plane may also be either <u>unmarked</u> or <u>ignored</u>.  An <u>ignored</u> plane is drawn in
       unhighlighted  mode, and a line of dashes is displayed in the command field of the information area.  The
       plane will remain this way until a mark command has been issued.  Any other command will be  issued,  but
       the command line will return to a line of dashes when the command is completed.

       An  <u>unmarked</u>  plane  is treated the same as an <u>ignored</u> plane, except that it will automatically switch to
       <u>marked</u> status when a delayed command has been processed.  This is useful if you want to  forget  about  a
       plane for a while, but its flight path has not yet been completely set.

       As  with  all  of  the commands, marking, unmarking and ignoring will take effect at the beginning of the
       next update.  Do not be surprised if the plane does not immediately switch to unhighlighted mode.

   <b>EXAMPLES</b>
             atlab1    Plane A: turn left at beacon #1

             cc        Plane C: circle

             gtte4ab2  Plane G: turn towards exit #4 at beacon #2

             ma+2      Plane M: altitude: climb 2000 feet

             stq       Plane S: turn to 315

             xi        Plane X: ignore

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>•</b>   Jets move every update; prop planes move every other update.

       <b>•</b>   All planes turn at most 90 degrees per movement.

       <b>•</b>   Planes enter at 7000 feet and leave at 9000 feet.

       <b>•</b>   Planes flying at an altitude of 0 crash if they are not over an airport.

       <b>•</b>   Planes waiting at airports can only be told to take off (climb in altitude).

       <b>•</b>   Pressing return (that is, entering an empty command) will perform the next update immediately.   This
           allows you to ``fast forward'' the game clock if nothing interesting is happening.

</pre><h4><b>NEW</b> <b>GAMES</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>Game_List</u>  file lists the currently available play fields.  New field description file names must be
       placed in this file to be playable.  If a player specifies a game not in this file, his score will not be
       logged.

       The game field description files are broken into two parts.  The first part is  the  definition  section.
       Here, the four tunable game parameters must be set.  These variables are set with the syntax:

             <b>variable</b> <b>=</b> <b>number;</b>

       Variable  may  be  one  of:  <b>update</b>,  indicating  the number of seconds between forced updates; <b>newplane</b>,
       indicating (about) the number of updates between new plane entries; <b>width</b>, indicating the  width  of  the
       play field; or <b>height</b>, indicating the height of the play field.

       The  second  part  of  the field description files describes the locations of the exits, the beacons, the
       airports and the lines.  The syntax is as follows:

             beacon:   (x y) ... ;
             airport:  (x y direction) ... ;
             exit:     (x y direction) ... ;
             line:     [ (x1 y1) (x2 y2) ] ... ;

       For beacons, a simple x, y coordinate pair is used (enclosed in parenthesis).  Airports and exits require
       a third value, which is one of the directions <u>wedcxzaq</u>.  For airports, this is the direction that  planes
       must  be  going to take off and land, and for exits, this is the direction that planes will be going when
       they <u>enter</u> the arena.  This may not seem intuitive, but as there is no restriction on direction of  exit,
       this  is  appropriate.  Lines are slightly different, since they need two coordinate pairs to specify the
       line endpoints.  These endpoints must be enclosed in square brackets.

       All statements are semi-colon (;) terminated.  Multiple item statements accumulate.  Each definition must
       occur exactly once, before any item statements.  Comments begin with a hash (#) symbol and terminate with
       a newline.  The coordinates are between zero and  width-1  and  height-1  inclusive.   All  of  the  exit
       coordinates  must lie on the borders, and all of the beacons and airports must lie inside of the borders.
       Line endpoints may be anywhere within the field, so long as the lines are horizontal, vertical or <u>exactly</u>
       diagonal.

   <b>FIELD</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       # This is the default game.

       update = 5;
       newplane = 5;
       width = 30;
       height = 21;

       exit:           ( 12  0 x ) ( 29  0 z ) ( 29  7 a ) ( 29 17 a )
                       (  9 20 e ) (  0 13 d ) (  0  7 d ) (  0  0 c ) ;

       beacon:         ( 12  7 ) ( 12 17 ) ;

       airport:        ( 20 15 w ) ( 20 18 d ) ;

       line:           [ (  1  1 ) (  6  6 ) ]
                       [ ( 12  1 ) ( 12  6 ) ]
                       [ ( 13  7 ) ( 28  7 ) ]
                       [ ( 28  1 ) ( 13 16 ) ]
                       [ (  1 13 ) ( 11 13 ) ]
                       [ ( 12  8 ) ( 12 16 ) ]
                       [ ( 11 18 ) ( 10 19 ) ]
                       [ ( 13 17 ) ( 28 17 ) ]
                       [ (  1  7 ) ( 11  7 ) ] ;

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Files are kept in a special directory.  See the “OPTIONS” section for a way to print this path  out.   It
       is normally <u>/usr/share/games/bsdgames/atc</u>.

       This  directory contains the file <u>Game_List</u>, which holds the list of playable games, as well as the games
       themselves.

       The scores are kept in <u>/var/games/bsdgames/atc_score</u>.
