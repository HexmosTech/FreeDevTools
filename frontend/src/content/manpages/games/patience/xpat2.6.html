</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xpat2 - generic patience game for X11

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xpat2</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>seed</u> ] [ <u>saved</u> <u>game</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xpat2</u>  is  the successor of <b>xpat</b>, a generic patience game which can be used with different rule sets.  It
       does understand the rules of the well-known <u>Spider</u> game, as well as <u>Klondike</u> and others.  It  features  a
       flexible  layout  which  responds  to  window resize commands and possibilities to customize the existing
       rules.  <u>xpat2</u> has either a bitmap-based card drawing routine or a pixmap  based  routine  (selectable  at
       compile  time).   With  the  pixmap based drawing routine, antialiased colour images of the rank and suit
       symbols are supplied.  The bitmap card images are black and red by default, but users can  supply  images
       of complete colour cards in XPM format.

       <u>xpat2</u>  may  be  compiled  with the Athena widget set (or its nicer replacement, the Xaw3d widget set), or
       with a standard Xlib interface. The command line parameters  and  X  resource  names  of  these  versions
       differ.  This  manual page describes only the Athena widget version, for the Xlib options please refer to
       the <u>xpat</u> manual page.

</pre><h4><b>RULE</b> <b>CUSTOMIZATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-rules</b> <u>rule</u> <u>name</u>
           (Resource: <b>Tableau.rules</b>)

           This option specifies the initial rule set for <u>xpat</u>.  Valid rule names are <b>Gypsy</b>,  <b>Spider</b>,  <b>FreeCell</b>,
           <b>Klondike</b>,  and  <b>Seahaven</b>,  <b>Monte</b>  <b>Carlo</b>,  <b>Calculation</b>, <b>Canfield</b>, <b>Baker's</b> <b>Dozen</b>, and others. Supply an
           invalid rule name to see a complete listing.

           The initial rule set may also be given by the name of the executable (capitalisation is important). A
           predefined rule set may be customized by the following options, but not all options  apply  to  every
           rule set.

       <b>-slots</b> <u>slots</u>
           (Resource: <b>Tableau.slots</b>)

           Use a different number of slots.

       <b>-tmps</b> <u>tmps</u>
           (Resource: <b>Tableau.tmps</b>)

           Use a different number of temporary storage places.

       <b>-decks</b> <u>decks</u>
           (Resource: <b>Tableau.decks</b>)

           Use  a  different  number of decks. Every deck has a full set of 52 cards.  This option does also set
           the number of stacks. (To 4 times the number of decks, naturally.)

       <b>-facedown</b> <u>number</u>
           (Resource: <b>Tableau.facedown</b>)

           Specifies the number of cards per slot which are initially dealt face-down (i.e. invisible).

       <b>-faceup</b> <u>number</u>
           (Resource: <b>Tableau.faceup</b>)

           Specifies the number of cards per slot which are initially dealt face-up.

       <b>-jokers</b> <u>number</u>
           (Resource: <b>Tableau.jokers</b>)

           Specifies the number of jokers in the game (increasing the number of cards).  With jokers,  you  have
           to put all ordinary cards onto the stacks and keep the jokers on the slots.

       <b>-relaxed</b> <u>number</u>
           <b>-flips</b> <u>number</u> <b>-turn</b> <u>number</u> <b>-rotations</b> <u>number</u> (Resource: <b>Tableau.relaxed</b> to <b>Tableau.rotations</b>)

           Defines game specific customisation parameters.

       <b>-rng</b> <u>number</u>
           (Resource: <b>Tableau.rng</b>)

           This  option  affects  the random number generator. rng 0 (used up to version 1.03 of xpat2) has been
           found to generate not uniformly distributed permutations.  You may activate it to be able  to  replay
           old saved games. The default is rng 1.

</pre><h4><b>GRAPHIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All standard X toolkit parameters may be given, such as

       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>
           Specifies on which display to run.

       <b>-geometry</b> <u>geometry</u>
           (Resource: <b>geometry</b>) Specifies the initial geometry.

           Other options are:

       <b>-cards</b> <u>cardset</u>
           (Resource: <b>Tableau.cards</b>)

           <u>cardset</u>  is  the  filename  of an external bitmap card set which will be used instead of the built-in
           cardset. There are two card sets, namely  <b>small</b> and  <b>french</b>. You can also give the full pathname of a
           cardset here.

       <b>-xpmdir</b> <u>xpmdir</u>
           (Resource: <b>Tableau.xpmdir</b>)

           Tells <u>xpat2</u> to search <u>xpmdir</u> for colour replacements of the card images. The filenames  searched  for
           are  <b>Joker.xpm</b>  and <u>Rank.Suit</u><b>.xpm</b>, where <u>Rank</u> is one of <b>Two</b> to <b>Ten</b>, or one of <b>Jack,</b> <b>Queen,</b> <b>King,</b> <b>Ace</b>.
           The display must be capable of displaying all images at the same time.  For a 256-colour display,  no
           more  than 128 colours should be used for all card images together. An additional file, <b>Cardback.xpm</b>,
           may give you nice cardbacks.

           If the directory name <u>xpmdir</u> does not  start  with  a  dot  or  a  slash,  it  is  interpreted  as  a
           subdirectory of <b>/usr/share/games/xpat</b>.

       <b>-xpmcls</b> <u>xpmcls</u>
           (Resource: <b>Tableau.xpmcls</b>)

           Tells  <u>xpat2</u>  to  allow using colours of the given closeness when allocation of the real colour fails
           during the reading of an xpm file.  This option is useful on 8-bit X-servers when  many  colours  are
           already allocated by other applications (typically when using a KDE desktop).

       <b>-tb</b> <u>color</u>
           (Resource: <b>Tableau.background</b>)

           Sets the background color to <u>color</u>. The default is <b>LightSlateGrey</b>.

       <b>-cb</b> <u>color</u>
           (Resource: <b>Tableau.cardbackColor</b>)

           Sets  the  background  color  of  the cards to <u>color</u>. The default is <b>SlateGrey</b>. This option is not in
           effect when an XPM replacement for the cardback is used.

       <b>-markwidth</b> <u>width</u>
           (Resource: <b>Tableau.markWidth</b>)

           Sets the width of the dashed frame which marks selected cards.  If this width is at least half of the
           card width, marked cards will be shaded. The default is to shade the cards.

       <b>-markcolor</b> <u>color</u>
           (Resource: <b>markColor</b>)

           Sets the color of the marking frame.

       <b>-sound,</b> <b>-nosound</b>
           (Resource: <b>Sound.state</b>)

           Enables or Disables sound.

</pre><h4><b>NATIVE</b> <b>LANGUAGE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xpat2</b> has simple support for different languages. All messages which appear in  the  X11  window  may  be
       overloaded  by  files,  as  well  as  the  key bindings.  The typical support consists of an application-
       defaults file, a message file, and a keyboard file. Possibly translated online-help files are also there.
       To select a different language, call <b>xpat2</b> after setting the environment variable  <b>LANG</b>  to  the  desired
       value.   Some  ISO3166  language  codes  will  be  mapped  to  their  correspondig xpat2 directory names.
       Currently, italian and german versions are available, and fragments of a french and russian version.  The
       russian version requires a special cyrillic font, <b>sq01</b>.  The bdf-file is distributed with <b>xpat2</b>, you have
       to convert it into a format supported by your X-server (pcf, snf, ...)

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
        <b>/usr/games/xpat2</b>
        <b>/var/games/xpat2/xpat.log</b>
        <b>/usr/share/doc/xpat2</b>
        <b>/usr/share/games/xpat/small.cards</b>
        <b>/usr/share/games/xpat/french.cards</b>
        <b>/usr/share/games/xpat/audio/success.au</b>
        <b>/usr/share/games/xpat/audio/giveup.au</b>
        <b>/usr/share/games/xpat/audio/goodbye.au</b>
        <b>/usr/share/games/xpat/audio/cannotsave.au</b>
        <b>/usr/share/games/xpat/help.*</b>
        <b>/usr/share/games/xpat/hlp*</b>

       and a number of subdirs of <b>/usr/share/games/xpat</b>, containing sets of colour cards.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Almost none. (Type '<b>v</b>' to see the version number. This is the  man-page  of  xpat2  version  1.06,  using
       Athena Widgets. The game may behave somewhat different when used with another widget set.)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If the window is too small, it can happen that not all information is displayed, e.g. some stacks of card
       are invisible as they are outside the visible space.

       Correct cheat counting is not implemented in all rules.

       Only a few rule customisations are checked and meaningful.

       The Motif/Lesstif and Xview interfaces doesn't work reliable. Any volunteers?

       <b>xpat2</b>  uses  a lot of colours when compiled with the module <b>X-gfx2</b> and may therefore fail to start if you
       have an 8-bit or monochrome display. In this case, compile the game using  the  graphics  loader  <b>X-gfx1</b>,
       which  uses  the original card images from <b>spider</b> or start the game using the option <b>-cards</b> <b>french</b>, which
       uses monochrome card graphics from the file <b>french.cards</b>.  On 8-bit displays you can also experiment with
       the <b>-xpmcls</b> option.

       There is a problem with X-servers which are short on memory. In this case, some parts of the xpat2 window
       may be left blank after a resize event.  You have to hit &lt;ctrl-L&gt; to get the window redrawn correctly.

       Please mail bug reports to <b><a href="mailto:Michael.Bischoff@gmx.net">Michael.Bischoff@gmx.net</a></b>.  Fixes are especially welcome.
