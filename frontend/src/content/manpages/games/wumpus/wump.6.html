       wump — hunt the wumpus in an underground cave

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wump</b> [<b>-h</b>] [<b>-a</b> <u>arrows</u>] [<b>-b</b> <u>bats</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>pits</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>rooms</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>tunnels</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  game  <b>wump</b>  is  based on a fantasy game first presented in the pages of <u>People's</u> <u>Computer</u> <u>Company</u> in
       1973.  In Hunt the Wumpus you are placed in a cave built of many different rooms, all  interconnected  by
       tunnels.   Your  quest  is  to  find and shoot the evil Wumpus that resides elsewhere in the cave without
       running into any pits or using up your limited supply of arrows.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-a</b>      Specifies the number of magic arrows the adventurer gets.  The default is five.

       <b>-b</b>      Specifies the number of rooms in the cave which contain bats.  The default is three.

       <b>-h</b>      Play the hard version -- more pits, more bats, and a generally more dangerous cave.

       <b>-p</b>      Specifies the number of rooms in the cave which contain bottomless pits.  The default is three.

       <b>-r</b>      Specifies the number of rooms in the cave.  The default cave size is twenty-five rooms.

       <b>-t</b>      Specifies the number of tunnels connecting each room in the cave to another  room.   Beware,  too
               many  tunnels  in  a small cave can easily cause it to collapse!  The default cave room has three
               tunnels to other rooms.

       While wandering through the cave you'll notice that, while there are tunnels everywhere, there  are  some
       mysterious  quirks to the cave topology, including some tunnels that go from one room to another, but not
       necessarily back!  Also, most pesky of all are the rooms that are home to large numbers of  bats,  which,
       upon being disturbed, will en masse grab you and move you to another portion of the cave (including those
       housing bottomless pits, sure death for unwary explorers).

       Fortunately,  you're  not going into the cave without any weapons or tools, and in fact your biggest aids
       are your senses; you can often smell the rather odiferous Wumpus up to <u>two</u> rooms away, and you can always
       feel the drafts created by the occasional bottomless pit and hear the rustle of the bats  in  caves  they
       might be sleeping within.

       To  kill  the wumpus, you'll need to shoot it with one of your magic arrows.  Fortunately, you don't have
       to be in the same room as the creature, and can instead shoot the arrow from as  far  as  three  or  four
       rooms away!

       When  you  shoot an arrow, you do so by typing in a list of rooms that you'd like it to travel to.  If at
       any point in its travels it cannot find a tunnel to the room you specify from the room it's in,  it  will
       instead randomly fly down one of the tunnels, possibly, if you're real unlucky, even flying back into the
       room you're in and hitting you!
