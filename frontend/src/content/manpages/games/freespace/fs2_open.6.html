       fs2_open - manual page for FreeSpace 2 Open

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fs2_open</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       FreeSpace      2      Open      Website:     <a href="http://scp.indiegames.us">http://scp.indiegames.us</a>     Mantis     (bug     reporting):
       <a href="http://scp.indiegames.us/mantis/">http://scp.indiegames.us/mantis/</a>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: fs2_open [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>Graphic:</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-spec</b>  Enable specular

              Only polygons mapped with textures for which a shinemap exists will receive specular  mapping;  no
              attempt  is  made  to generate spec maps where they do not exist. Specular maps are specified with
              the base map name plus "-shine" (i.e. TCov3A-shine.pcx).

              FS2 Open, 3.6.15: This feature is on by default,  use  launcher  option  Disable  Specular  or  if
              necessary to manually disable enter the flag -nospec

       <b>-glow</b>  Enable glow maps

              Only  polygons  mapped  with textures for which a glowmap exists will be glowmapped. Glow maps are
              specified with the base map name plus "-glow" (i.e. TCov4A-glow.pcx)

              FS2 Open, 3.6.15: This feature is on by default, use launcher  option  Disable  Glow  Maps  or  if
              necessary to manually disable enter the flag -noglow

       <b>-env</b>   Enable environment maps

              It  only  works  if  -spec  is also set. Environment mapping intensity will be determined from the
              shine map too (see Texturing for more info). See Video setup.

              FS2 Open, 3.6.15: This feature is on by default, use launcher option Disable Environment  Maps  or
              if necessary to manually disable enter the flag -noenv

       <b>-mipmap</b>
              Enable mipmapping

              Causes  for  non-mipmapped  textures  to  have mipmaps generated within the GPU on certain kind of
              texture formats, (IIRC, DDS formatted textures with a power of 2 size in both width  and  height).
              Since  the  use of already mipmapped DDS textures has become common, it has become deprecated. The
              quality of the generated mipmaps depends on each GPU and used driver. It  is  normally  used  with
              -img2dds flag.

       <b>-nomotiondebris</b>
              Disable motion debris

       <b>-noscalevid</b>
              Disable scale-to-window for movies

              Disables fullscreen scaling of video clips.

       <b>-missile_lighting</b>
              Apply lighting to missiles

       <b>-normal</b>
              Enable normal maps

              Normal  maps  require  GLSL  rendering,  (see  OpenGL  Shaders  (GLSL) for further info). It needs
              auxiliary normal maps (the same name of the base  map  plus  "-normal").  DXT5_NM  DDS  format  is
              needed.  (Technical  note: DXT5 will work, since only the GREEN and ALPHA channels are read by the
              current shader system. One direction of lines goes into the GREEN  channel,  the  other  direction
              goes  into  the  ALPHA  channel.  RED  and  BLUE can be either base gray (#808080) or black. Usual
              practice is after creating the DXT5_NM, copy the RED channel to the ALPHA channel, black  out  the
              RED and BLUE an then save as either a DXT5 or u8888 (uncompressed) DDS file.)

              FS2  Open,  3.6.15:  This  feature is on by default, use launcher option Disable Normal Maps or if
              necessary to manually disable enter the flag -nonormal

       <b>-3dshockwave</b>
              Enable 3D shockwaves

              This only has any effect when both a 2d and 3d shockwave effect are present,  otherwise  the  only
              available effect is used.

       <b>-post_process</b>
              Enable post processing

              enables  the use (if present) of post-processing effects as defined by the post_process.tbl. Bloom
              usage has an additional cmdline option for setting it's value, most post  processing  effects  are
              achieved in mission per the mission designer or can be enabled globally in the table.

       <b>-soft_particles</b>
              Enable soft particles

       <b>-fxaa</b>  Enable FXAA anti-aliasing

              Enables  the  FXAA  postprocessing  stage.  Needs  optional FXAA shaders, which can be found here:

</pre><h4><b>Game</b> <b>Speed:</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-img2dds</b>
              Compress non-compressed images

              Converts all images to DDS (compressed) format. Decreases memory  usage  but  potentially  reduces
              image quality.

       <b>-no_vsync</b>
              Disable vertical sync

       <b>-cache_bitmaps</b>
              Cache bitmaps between missions

              Will ideally reduce the load-time from one mission to another.

</pre><h4><b>HUD:</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-dualscanlines</b>
              Add another pair of scanning lines

              Adds a second pair of scanning lines to the target window when scanning an object.

       <b>-targetinfo</b>
              Enable info next to target

              Displays target info, such as name and class, beside the targeted object.

       <b>-orbradar</b>
              Enable 3D radar

              An Orb style 3D radar will replace the standard 2D version.

       <b>-rearm_timer</b>
              Enable rearm/repair completion timer

              Displays time remaining until rearm and repair from a support ship is complete.

       <b>-ballistic_gauge</b>
              Enable analog ballistic ammo gauge

              Adds an ammo gauge to the HUD when armed with a ballistic weapon.

</pre><h4><b>Gameplay:</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-mod</b>

              Specifies  in  which  folders  inside  FreeSpace 2 directory, the game looks for all the game data
              (models, missions, textures, tables, ...).  Retail  version  only  looks  inside  Freespace2/data/
              structure and Freespace2/vp archives.

              This  flag  allows  installing  several  different mods that modify retail behavior, and switching
              between them without needing to erase files or having undesired cross effects. Each mod should  be
              installed in its own folder.

              It  takes  one argument string: the chain of names of the used directories. Comma (,) must be used
              as separator. In this way, -mod dir1,dir2,dir3,...,dirx causes  the  game  to  use  the  following
              directory precedence:

                  Freespace2/dir1/
                  Freespace2/dir2/
                  Freespace2/dir3/
                  ... (the rest of the typed directories) ...
                  Freespace2/dirx/
                  Freespace2/

              This  flag  can  be indirectly set, (and it is normally set), through Launcher MOD tab and mod.ini
              file.

              Within the Launcher's MOD tab you can select one directory, (let's call it moddir), so the flag is
              at least set to -mod moddir. If Freespace2/moddir/mod.ini exists it will be  used  to  modify  the
              -mod flag, too.

       <b>-ship_choice_3d</b>
              Use 3D models for ship selection

              Uses  ship  models  in ship selection window. It completely disables the standard ANI interface in
              this screen. Some mods need a compulsory use of  this  flag  because  they  don't  have  available
              animations for their ships. In this situation, and if it is not used, the game will probably crash
              to desktop in the ship selection window.

       <b>-weapon_choice_3d</b>
              Use 3D models for weapon selection

              Uses  weapon  models  in  weapon  loadout  window  for  secondary weapons (missiles and bombs). It
              completely disables the standard ANI interface in this screen. Some mods need a compulsory use  of
              this  flag  because  they  don't  have  available  animations for their secondary weapons. In this
              situation, and if it is not used, the game will probably crash to desktop in  the  weapon  loadout
              window.

       <b>-3dwarp</b>
              Enable 3D warp

              Use full geometry for the subspace warp effect.

       <b>-warp_flash</b>
              Enable flash upon warp

              Enable a flash at warp in and warp out.

       <b>-no_ap_interrupt</b>
              Disable interrupting autopilot

              Tells the game to not allow players to interrupt an autopilot already-in-progress.

</pre><h4><b>Audio:</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-snd_preload</b>
              Preload mission game sounds

              Useful in preventing game stuttering when sounds are played for the first time.

       <b>-nosound</b>
              Disable all sound

       <b>-nomusic</b>
              Disable music

       <b>-standalone</b>
              Run as standalone server

              Creates a standalone multi-player server.

       <b>-startgame</b>
              Skip mainhall and start hosting

              Once  you  launch  and  choose  a pilot within the game, you will immediately have begun to host a
              game. This can be used in conjunction with several options  to  customize  the  game  you  create:
              -closed, -restricted, -password, -gamename, -allowabove, and -allowbelow. -startgame has no effect
              when -standalone is used.

              See related: -closed -restricted -password -gamename -allowabove -allowbelow

       <b>-closed</b>
              Start hosted server as closed

              Hosts  a  new  game  in  a closed state, where no one can join until the in-game "Close" button is
              cleared. This only works when used in conjunction with -startgame. Cannot be used  in  conjunction
              with -restricted or -password.

              See related: -startgame -restricted -password

       <b>-restricted</b>
              Host confirms join requests

              Hosts  a  new game in a restricted state. The host is presented with option to accept or deny each
              client's request to join the game. This only works  when  used  in  conjunction  with  -startgame.
              Cannot be used in conjunction with -closed or -password.

              See related: -startgame -closed -password

       <b>-multilog</b>

              Creates  a  log file with a summary of packets sent and received in multiplayer games. The file is
              saved as atalti.log within the active mod folder—or with main data folder if no mod is active.

       <b>-clientdamage</b>
              This feature is not available in current builds.

       <b>-mpnoreturn</b>
              Disable flight deck option

              Disables return to the flight deck screen after a mission completes.

</pre><h4><b>Troubleshooting:</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-nohtl</b> Software mode (very slow)

              Reverts to software rendering mode.  <b>Warning:</b> <b>Enabling</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>performance.</b>

       <b>-no_set_gamma</b>
              Disable setting of gamma

              Disables the gamma settings in the options screen.

       <b>-nomovies</b>

              Disables all video playback.

       <b>-noparseerrors</b>
              Disable parsing errors

              Disables some parsing warnings and makes other parse errors non-fatal.  Do not rely on  this  when
              creating new tables. The errors are there for a reason.

       <b>-query_speech</b>
              Check if this build has speech

              Determines if the current build includes text-to-speech.

       <b>-novbo</b> Disable OpenGL VBO

       <b>-noibx</b> Don't use cached index buffers (IBX)

              Disables  IBX caching of model geometry data. This will dramatically increase load times, but will
              help troubleshoot a model if one is working incorrectly.

       <b>-loadallweps</b>
              Load all weapons, even those not used

       <b>-voicer</b>
              Enable voice recognition

              Windows-only. Enables voice-recognition for wingmen commands. Must be specifically compiled into a
              build  in  order  for it to be available; 3.6.10 final includes the feature. See Voice Recognition
              for more details.

       <b>-fb_explosions</b>
              Enable Framebuffer Shockwaves

</pre><h4><b>Development</b> <b>Tools:</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-fps</b>   Show frames per second on HUD

              Displays current frames per second.

       <b>-pos</b>   Show position of camera

              Displays current position coordinates of camera.

       <b>-window</b>
              Run in window

              Runs the game in a window. No check to make sure that resolution is no higher  than  your  desktop
              resolution, so be careful.

       <b>-stats</b> Show statistics

              Shows total and free physical memory, virtual memory and system pagefile.

       <b>-coords</b>
              Show coordinates

              Shows coordinates of the mouse cursor.

       <b>-show_mem_usage</b>
              Show memory usage

              Shows  detailed  RAM usage based on file, handler and process usage and display on the left-center
              side of the screen during mission load and while in mission.

              The meaning of the info displayed in the upper right corner of the HUD is:

              DYN = dynamic memory, basically anything that's been allocated by the vm_* memory functions.  This
              does NOT indicate total memory usage but does account for most of it.

              POF = model memory, how much memory is being used by models (does not include textures)

              C-BMP,  BMP  = bmpman memory, how much is used by the textures/images that are loaded. C-BMP means
              that you are using -cache_bitmaps and it will try to keep textures in memory between  level  loads
              and as the new level is loading it will keep what it needs and unload what it doesn't. Can greatly
              increase level loading speed, but does so at the cost of memory between level loads. This does not
              increase  overall  memory  usage  though, only during the loading screen. BMP means that it is not
              cached and all textures are unloaded from memory at  the  start  of  level  load  and  all  needed
              textures are then loaded from the disk again.

              S-RAM  =  sound  memory,  how much is used by the sounds loaded in memory at the time. This counts
              static sounds only (from sounds.tbl, etc.) and  not  streaming  sounds  (music,  voices,  briefing
              stuff, etc).

              V-RAM  =  approximate  memory  usage of video textures. This does not mean that your card has this
              much memory, and can report higher numbers that your card actually has memory. For OpenGL it  also
              includes  some  of  the geometry data, but this number does not reflect the total memory that your
              video card is using. It only reports how much data the  game  has  purposefully  loaded  into  API
              memory (meaning it could be in system memory, video card memory, or AGP memory).

              (It only works with debug builds, not with release builds).

       <b>-pofspew</b>

              Reads  all  objects  in  the  pof file of the selected mod, and creates an ibx cache file for each
              object in the data/cache folder for that mod.  Details for each object are output to a pofspew.txt
              file created in the data folder. Otherwise, ibx files are created in game before each mission.

       <b>-tablecrcs</b>

              Is actually now (or should be) a typed  reference  rather  than  as  a  selection  item.  Takes  1
              argument,  usually  a  descriptive  name.  Example  usage:  "-table_crcs  MediaVPs"  will create a
              table_crcs.csv file in the running mod (name can be separate of the mod selected) that allows  for
              the validation of the tables used by that mod while on-line. The descriptive parameter given helps
              "allocate" that .csv file to the mod in question, and as such should closely or exactly match that
              mods name if possible.

       <b>-missioncrcs</b>

              Is  actually  now  (or  should  be)  a  typed  reference  rather than as a selection item. Takes 1
              argument, usually a descriptive name.  Example  usage:  "-mission_crcs  MediaVPs"  will  create  a
              mission_crcs.csv  file  in  the running mod (name can be separate of the mod selected) that allows
              for the validation of the missions used by that mod while on-line. The descriptive parameter given
              helps "allocate" that .csv file to the mod in question, and as  such  should  closely  or  exactly
              match that mods name if possible.

       <b>-dis_collisions</b>
              Disable collisions

       <b>-dis_weapons</b>
              Disable weapon rendering

       <b>-output_sexps</b>
              Output SEXPs to sexps.html

              This will make the FSO build spit out an html file that documents the supported SEXP's.

              Just double click on sexps.html and it should open in your default web browser.

       <b>-output_scripting</b>
              Output scripting to scripting.html

              This  will  make  the FSO build spit out an html file that documents the supported scripting hooks
              and LUA libraries.

              Just double click on scripting.html and it should open in your default web browser.

       <b>-save_render_target</b>
              Save render targets to file

       <b>-debug_window</b>
              Display debug window

       <b>-verify_vps</b>
              Spew VP CRCs to vp_crcs.txt

              Exports the CRC values of the VP files being loaded into a vp_crcs.txt file.

       <b>-nograb</b>
