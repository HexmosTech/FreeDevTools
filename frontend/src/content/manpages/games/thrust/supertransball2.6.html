</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       supertransball2 - Thrust type of game

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Super</b>  <b>Transball</b> <b>2</b> is a game which was inspired by ZARA THRUSTA for the Amiga 500. In each level the goal
       is to find the SPHERE, to capture it and to carry it to the upper part of the level. The  main  challenge
       is the gravity that attracts your ship which makes it inevitable to control the ship's thrust. Many other
       obstacles  like cannons, tanks, doors or lasers will also try to make your journey difficult and don't be
       wasteful with your thrusters and weapons or you will run out of fuel in no time.

       Super Transball 2 ships with 3 unique level packs consisting of  26  levels  in  total.  You  can  choose
       between  them  by  pressing  the  L-key  ingame.  If  a level seems being to difficult you can skip it by
       entering  a  code  after  pressing  the  C-key  in  the  main  menu.  These  cheats  are   available   in
       /usr/share/doc/supertransball2.

</pre><h4><b>VIDEO</b> <b>RESOLUTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  game starts in windowed mode with a resolution of 320x240 pixel. However you can change this setting
       ingame with the ALT-key + 1,2,3,4 or ENTER combination.
