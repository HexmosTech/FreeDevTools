</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sky - science fiction adventure game

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  science-fiction  thriller  set  in  a bleak post-apocalyptic vision of the future, Beneath a Steel Sky
       revolves around "Union City", where selfishness, rivalry, and corruption by its citizens seems to be  all
       too  common,  those who can afford it live underground, away from the pollution and social problems which
       are plaguing the city.

       You take on the role of Robert Foster, an outcast of sorts from the city since a boy who was raised in  a
       remote  environment  outside  of  Union City simply termed "the gap".  Robert's mother took him away from
       Union City as a child on their way to "Hobart" but the  helicopter  crashed  on  its  way,  unfortunately
       Robert's mother dies, but he survives and is left to be raised by a local tribe from the gap.

       Years  later,  Union  City  security  drops by and abducts Robert, killing his tribe in the process; upon
       reaching the city the helicopter taking him there crashes with him escaping, high upon a tower  block  in
       the  middle  of  the city he sets out to discover the truth about his past, and to seek vengeance for the
       killing of his tribe.
