</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xbomb - a version of the popular minesweeper program with some novel features.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  game  of  logical  deduction against the clock. The purpose of the game is to find the location of the
       hidden bombs in a grid.  Each of the locations  in  the  grid  is  initially  covered,  by  uncovering  a
       locations,  a  number  or  a  bomb  will  be revealed underneath.  If a bomb is revealed then the game is
       finished.  A number indicates the number of adjacent locations that contain bombs.  Locations  that  have
       not been uncovered but are thought to contain bombs can be marked as such so that they can be identified.

       There is a choice of hexagonal, square or triangular units that make up the grid, the level of difficulty
       increasing as the number of sides decreases.  In all cases the grids are of the same size and contain the
       same number of bombs for the same levels.

       There are three levels to the game:

       <b>Easy</b>   8 by 8 grid with 10 bombs.

       <b>Medium</b> 16 by 16 grid with 40 bombs.

       <b>Difficult</b>
              30 by 16 grid with 99 bombs.

       A high score table is maintained for each of the levels for each of the grid types, storing the username,
       the time to complete the puzzle and the date that it was finished.

</pre><h4><b>MOUSE</b> <b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       The game is played with the mouse, with all three buttons having different actions.

       <b>Left</b> Button
              Uncover  the  current  location if it is hidden or uncover all surrounding locations marked as not
              containing bombs if the square is already uncovered. The first selection made in a game is  always
              a 'safe' square.

       <b>Middle</b> Button
              Uncover all surrounding locations that are not marked as containing a bomb.

       <b>Right</b> Button
              Mark the current grid location as having a hidden bomb (toggle).
