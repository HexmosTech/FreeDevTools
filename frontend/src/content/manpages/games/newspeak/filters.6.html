</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        $SHELL | chef

        eleet | wall # b1ff works well too

        b1ff | ircII | censor

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       All of these programs are filters to do all sorts of  strange  things  to  text.   No  personal,  racial,
       religious or societal slurs are intended. For amusement only.

       All  the  filters  read  input from stdin, change it, and write the filtered text to stdout. Some filters
       also support reading from files and writing to stdout.

       b1ff   The B1FF filter

       lolcat As seen in internet gifs everywhere.

       cockney
              Cockney English

       chef   convert English on stdin to Mock Swedish on stdout

       eleet  K3wl hacker slang

       fanboy Speak like a fanboy. Filters out extraneous words and focuses on the words fans use.  By  default,
              it  will  speak  like a fan of git/Linus/linux development. To change this, pass as parameters the
              words that the fanboy typically uses. Alternatively, pass the name of a topic that  typically  has
              fanboys to use a predefined word list.

       fudd   Elmer Fudd

       jethro Hillbilly text filter

       jive   Jive English

       jibberish
              Runs text through a random selection of the rest of the filters, to make really weird output.

       ken    English into Cockney, featuring (dubious) rhyming slang for a lot of computer terminology.

       kraut  Generates text with a bad German accent.

       kenny  Generates text as spoken by Kenny on South Park.

       ky00te This program places a very cute (and familiar to FurryMuck fans) accent on any text file.

       nethackify
              Wiped out text like can be found in nethack.

       newspeak
              A-la-1984

       censor CDA-ize text

       nyc    Brooklyn English

       pirate Talk like a pirate.

       rasterman
              Makes text look like it came from the keyboard of Carsten Haitzler.

       scottish
              Fake scottish (dwarven) accent filter, inspired by the character "Durkon" from Order of the Stick.

       spammer
              Turns honest text into something that is liable to be flagged as spam.

       scramble
              Scramble the "inner" letters of each word in the input into a random order.  The resulting text is
              still strangely readable.

       studly Studly caps.

       uniencode
              Use glorious unicode to the fullest possible extent. As seen previously in many man pages.

       upside-down
              Flips text upside down. Stand on your head and squint to read the output.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Other filters:

       <b>pig</b>    From the bsdgames package, pig converts text to pig latin.

       <b>dog</b> <b>--oog</b>
              From the dog package, dog can also function as a filter, converting text to OOG-speak.
