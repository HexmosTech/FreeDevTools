</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pekka-kana-2 - (Pekka Kana 2) is an oldschool 2D platformer where you control a rooster called Pekka.
       Your mission is to save Pekka's chicken friends from an evil crow.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>==</b> <b>Rooster</b> <b>Island</b> <b>1</b> <b>==</b>
       Pekka is a rooster that lives in a farm in far away land called Finland.
       Pekka's job at the farm is to guard a henhouse full of (surprise!) chickens.
       Everything goes nice and peacefully, until one night...

       Something terrible happens: Someone steals all the chickens!
       And that someone is a wicked and crooked minded crow called "The Evil One" (a one spooky bird).
       Now, Pekka has to save all the stolen chickens and bring them back.
       And yes, to kick one ugly crow butt from here to infinity...

       But  it  won't  be  easy! The Evil One (friends call him Evil) has a horrible mind-bending device that he
       uses to control his army of hypnotized animals.
       They are also victims of The Evil One, but as long as Evil One has them, they are your enemies.

       <b>==</b> <b>Rooster</b> <b>Island</b> <b>2</b> <b>==</b>
       The plot thickens! After saving the chickens it becomes  obvious  why  The  Evil  One  kidnapped  Pekka's
       friends in the first place.
       Chicken brains are for some reason immune to The Evil One's mind bending device!
       Pekka also finds out (with his tiny brains) that Evil One has also been experimenting with strange voodoo
       magics and gene manipulation.
       But  that's  not  all!  Rumours  tell,  that  The Evil One is finishing prototypes of a new kind of world
       domination weapon.
       It is called "The Metal Hen"! Together these horrifying robots are capable  of  launching  a  world  wide
       mind-bending wave, that even the chickens can not escape!
       Once  again  you  must  stop The Evil One from taking over the world! And if you thought it was difficult
       last time - now it really gets ugly...
       Oh, and did I mention - he kidnapped your friends again. Isn't he just evil?

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>PLAY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>GAME'S</b> <b>GOAL</b>
       The game consists of episodes and episodes consists of levels.
       To complete an episode you must complete all the levels by finding an exit in each one of them.
       Sometimes there is a time limit that you must not exceed. There are no lives so you can try as many times
       as you want.
       Each level has its own hiscore and best lap time. After each level your score is counted to  see  if  you
       played better than the last time.
       The more bonuses you collect and the more enemies you knock out, the higher score you'll get.
       You  also  get  extra  bonuses  for remaining energy, items and time. Each level's score is added to your
       total score.
       To become a new episode champion, you must break the episode's hiscore.
       You can save your game anytime you like, but only your total score and your current position on  the  map
       will be stored.

       <b>CONTROLS</b>
       You can use keyboard or gamepad to move Pekka. In menus you can also use mouse to control the cursor.
       Here's a list of things Pekka can do.
