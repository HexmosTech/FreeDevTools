</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       trader - a game of interstellar trading

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>trader</b> [<b>--no-color</b>|<b>--no-colour</b>] [<b>--max-turn=</b><u>NUM</u>] [<u>GAME</u>]
       <b>trader</b> [<b>-h</b>|<b>--help</b>] [<b>-V</b>|<b>--version</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Star</b>  <b>Traders</b>  is  a simple game of interstellar trading, where the objective is to create companies, buy
       and sell shares, borrow and repay money, in order to become the wealthiest player (the winner).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>GAME</u>   If <u>GAME</u> is specified as a number between <b>1</b> and <b>9</b> (inclusive), load and continue playing that game.
              If <u>GAME</u> is not specified, start a new game.

       <b>--no-color</b>, <b>--no-colour</b>
              Don't use colour for displaying the text in the game.  Use this  option  for  a  “retro-computing”
              look (as shown in the <b>EXAMPLES</b> below).

       <b>--max-turn=</b><u>NUM</u>
              Set  the number of turns in the game to <u>NUM</u>.  In this version of Star Traders, <u>NUM</u> must be greater
              or equal to 10.  If this option is not specified, the default is 50 turns.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Show a summary of command-line options and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version information about the program, then exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>0</b>      Star Traders finished without any errors.

       <b>1</b>      Star Traders encountered an unrecoverable problem or error; a diagnostic message will  be  written
              to standard error in this case.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       You can start a new game by running Star Traders without any command line options:

              <b>trader</b>

       Once  the game starts, you will be asked to enter the number of people playing.  From one to eight people
       can play (although, in this version, they will all have to share the one keyboard  and  screen!).   After
       entering  the names of the players, you will have the opportunity to read instructions on how to play the
       game.  Do so—and good luck in the game!

       If you would like to continue a previously-saved game, simply specify that game  number  on  the  command
       line.  For example, the following starts game 4, if it was previously saved:

              <b>trader</b> <b>4</b>

       If  you  are  running under the X Window System, you might like to start the game in a dedicated <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1)
       window (typed all on one line):

              <b>xterm</b> <b>-g</b> <b>80x24</b> <b>-fa</b> <b>Mono</b> <b>-fs</b> <b>18</b> <b>-bg</b> <b>black</b> <b>-fg</b> <b>white</b> <b>-bc</b> <b>+sb</b> <b>+fbx</b> <b>-e</b> <b>trader</b> <b>&amp;</b>

       If you would like a full “retro-computing” green-screen experience, try (again, typed all on one line):

              <b>xterm</b> <b>-g</b> <b>80x24</b> <b>-fa</b> <b>Mono</b> <b>-fs</b> <b>18</b> <b>-bg</b> <b>'#181818'</b> <b>-fg</b> <b>'#2CAB00'</b> <b>-bc</b> <b>+sb</b> <b>+bdc</b> <b>+fbx</b> <b>-xrm</b> <b>'XTerm*colorBD:</b>
              <b>#41FF00'</b> <b>-e</b> <b>trader</b> <b>--no-colour</b> <b>&amp;</b>

       Or, if you prefer the old amber screens of yesteryear:

              <b>xterm</b> <b>-g</b> <b>80x24</b> <b>-fa</b> <b>Mono</b> <b>-fs</b> <b>18</b> <b>-bg</b> <b>'#101010'</b> <b>-fg</b> <b>'#AB7A00'</b> <b>-bc</b> <b>+sb</b> <b>+bdc</b> <b>+fbx</b> <b>-xrm</b> <b>'XTerm*colorBD:</b>
              <b>#FFB700'</b> <b>-e</b> <b>trader</b> <b>--no-colour</b> <b>&amp;</b>

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XDG_DATA_HOME</b>, <b>HOME</b>
              If <b>XDG_DATA_HOME</b> is set to an absolute pathname (that is, a  path  that  starts  with  “<u>/</u>”),  Star
              Traders  will  use that directory, with a subdirectory <u>trader</u>, to store game files.  If this envi‐
              ronment variable is not set or does  not  start  with  “<u>/</u>”,  <u><a href="file:~/.local/share/trader">~/.local/share/trader</a></u>  will  be  used
              instead, where “<u>~</u>” represents your home directory, as contained in the <b>HOME</b> environment variable.

       <b>LINES</b>, <b>COLUMNS</b>
              Star  Traders  uses the Curses library for displaying text on the screen.  As such, it will access
              these two environment variables if the underlying Curses library does so (see,  for  example,  the
              <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>  section in the <b><a href="../man3/ncurses.3.html">ncurses</a></b>(3) manual page for in-depth details).  It requires a text con‐
              sole or window of at least 80×24 in size.

       <b>LANG</b>, <b>LC_ALL</b>, etc.
              This version of Star Traders has full support for locales and will use appropriate  settings.   In
              particular,  messages  will  be displayed using <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> and <b>LANGUAGE</b> (if Star Traders has been
              translated into  that  language).   In  addition,  numeric  quantities  will  be  displayed  using
              <b>LC_NUMERIC</b> and monetary quantities will use <b>LC_MONETARY</b>.  See the <b><a href="../man7/locale.7.html">locale</a></b>(7) or <b><a href="../man3/setlocale.3.html">setlocale</a></b>(3) manual
              pages for more details on locale settings.

       <b>TEXTDOMAINDIR</b>
              If  set,  Star  Traders  will  use this path as the base with which to locate its message catalogs
              instead of the compiled-in path; the relevant <u>trader.mo</u> files should be located  in  language-code
              subdirectories (such as <u>en_AU</u>), in <u>LC_MESSAGES</u> sub-subdirectories.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.local/share/trader/game">~/.local/share/trader/game</a></u><b>N</b>
              Star  Traders  stores saved game files in the <u>.local/share/trader</u> subdirectory in your home direc‐
              tory (unless overridden by the <b>XDG_DATA_HOME</b> environment variable).  <u>N</u> is a number between <b>1</b> and <b>9</b>
              inclusive.  The game file is scrambled to prevent you or others from casually cheating!

       <u><a href="file:~/.trader/game">~/.trader/game</a></u><b>N</b>
              If the <u><a href="file:~/.trader">~/.trader</a></u> directory exists, game files will  be  read  from  and  saved  to  this  location
              instead.  This is for compatibility with versions of Star Traders prior to version 7.15.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The original (and very primitive) Star Traders game was written by S. J.  Singer  in  1984  using  Altair
       Basic.  This was modified for Microsoft Basic (MBASIC) running under the CP/M-80 operating system by John
       Zaitseff and released on 7th March, 1988.

       Star  Traders  was  then completely rewritten in 1990 for the Australian-designed 8-bit MicroBee computer
       running CP/M-80 on a Zilog Z80 processor, using Turbo Pascal 3.01a.  Essentially, only the  name  of  the
       game  and  some  of the ideas were retained in this version.  Version 4.1 of Star Traders was released on
       1st August, 1991.

       In 1992, it was recompiled for the NEC Advanced Personal Computer (with 8-inch  floppy  drives!)  running
       CP/M-86 on an 8086 processor, using Turbo Pascal 2.0.  This version had colour added to it in the form of
       ANSI escape sequences; version 4.4 was released on 2nd August, 1993.

       The  next version came in 1993, when the program was recompiled to run on IBM-compatible machines running
       MS-DOS and ANSI.SYS.  Turbo Pascal 6.0 was used for this.  The ANSI escape sequences were  slightly  dif‐
       ferent under MS-DOS than under the NEC, in that the NEC supported a number of extra character attributes.
       In other words, the MS-DOS version looked worse than the one running under CP/M-86!

       Star  Traders  was  recompiled  again in 1994 for IBM-compatible machines with VGA/EGA/CGA video graphics
       adapters.  The output routines were recoded to use a “windowed” look.  Borland Pascal 7.0  was  used  for
       this  purpose,  along with a number of text window manipulation modules.  Version 5.4 was released on 1st
       June, 1994.

       In 1995, Star Traders was completely rewritten for the 16-bit Microsoft Windows  3.1  graphical  environ‐
       ment.  Microsoft Visual Basic 3.0 was used for this purpose.  Although completely rewritten, the original
       algorithms  were  reused from previous versions.  Version 6.0 of the game was released on 15th September,
       1995.

       Star Traders was then to languish until almost 16 years later... when the game was rewritten once  again,
       this time in the C programming language.  Version 7.0 was released on 25th July, 2011 for Unix-like oper‐
       ating  systems  such  as Linux, with subsequent releases to add features and correct bugs.  Now you, too,
       can run this small piece of computing history!
