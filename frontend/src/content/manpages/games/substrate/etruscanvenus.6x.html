</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>etruscanvenus</u>  program  shows  a  3d  immersion  of a Klein bottle that smoothly deforms between the
       Etruscan Venus surface, the Roman surface, the Boy surface, and the Ida surface.  You  can  walk  on  the
       Klein  bottle  or  turn  it in 3d.  Topologically, all surfaces are Klein bottles, even the Roman and Boy
       surfaces, which are doubly covered and therefore appear to be an immersed  real  projective  plane.   The
       smooth deformation between these surfaces was constructed by George K. Francis.

       The  Klein  bottle  is  a non-orientable surface.  To make this apparent, the two-sided color mode can be
       used.  Alternatively, orientation markers (curling arrows) can be drawn as a texture map on  the  surface
       of  the  Klein  bottle.   While  walking on the Klein bottle, you will notice that the orientation of the
       curling arrows changes (which it must because  the  Klein  bottle  is  non-orientable).   Since  all  the
       surfaces except the Ida surface have points where the surface normal is not well defined for some points,
       walking is only performed on the Ida surface.

       As  mentioned above, the Roman and Boy surfaces are doubly covered and therefore appear to be an immersed
       real projective plane.  Since some of the parameter  names  are  based  on  this  interpretation  of  the
       surface,  the  geometry of the real projective plane will be briefly disussed.  The real projective plane
       is a model for the projective geometry in 2d space.  One point can be singled out as the origin.  A  line
       can be singled out as the line at infinity, i.e., a line that lies at an infinite distance to the origin.
       The  line  at  infinity is topologically a circle.  Points on the line at infinity are also used to model
       directions in projective geometry.  Direction and distance bands refer  to  this  interpretation  of  the
       surface.   If  direction  bands  are  used,  the  bands extend from the origin of the projective plane in
       different directions to the line at infinity and back to the origin.  If distance  bands  are  used,  the
       bands  lie  at  constant  distances  to  the  origin.   The  same interpretation is used for distance and
       direction colors.  Although there is no conceptually equivalent  geometric  interpretation  for  the  two
       Klein  bottle surfaces (the Etruscan Venus and Ida surfaces), the smooth deformation between the surfaces
       results in a natural extension of these concepts to the Klein bottle surfaces.

       The immersed surfaces can be projected to the screen  either  perspectively  or  orthographically.   When
       using the walking mode, perspective projection to the screen will be used.

       There  are  three  display  modes  for  the  Klein  bottle:  mesh  (wireframe),  solid,  or  transparent.
       Furthermore, the appearance of the surface can be as a solid object or as a  set  of  see-through  bands.
       The bands can be distance bands or direction bands, as explained above.

       The colors with with the surface is drawn can be set to one-sided, two-sided, distance, or direction.  In
       one-sided  mode,  the surface is drawn with the same color on both sides of the underlying triangles.  In
       two-sided mode, the surface is drawn with one color on one side  of  the  underlying  triangles  and  the
       complementary  color  on  the  other side.  Since the surface actually only has one side, the color jumps
       from red to green along a line on the surface.  This mode enables you to see that  the  surface  is  non-
       orientable.   In  distance  mode, the surface is displayed with fully saturated colors that depend on the
       distance of the points on the projective plane to the origin, as described  above.   If  the  surface  is
       displayed  as distance bands, each band will be displayed with a different color.  In direction mode, the
       surface is displayed with fully saturated colors that depend on the angle of the points on the projective
       plane with respect to the origin (see above  for  an  explanation).   If  the  surface  is  displayed  as
       direction  bands,  each  band  will  be  displayed  with a different color.  The colors used to color the
       surface can either be static or can be changed dynamically.

       The rotation speed for each of the three coordinate axes around which the Klein  bottle  rotates  can  be
       chosen.

       Furthermore,  in  the  walking  mode  the  walking direction in the 2d base square of the surface and the
       walking speed can be chosen.  The walking direction is measured as an angle in degrees in the  2d  square
       that  forms  the  coordinate  system  of the surface.  A value of 0 or 180 means that the walk is along a
       circle at a randomly chosen distance from the origin (parallel to a distance band).  A value of 90 or 270
       means that the walk is directly along a direction band.  Any other value results in a curved  path  along
       the surface.  As noted above, walking is performed only on the Ida surface.

       By  default,  the  immersion of the Klein bottle smoothly deforms between the Etruscan Venus surface, the
       Roman surface, the Boy surface, and the Ida  surface.   It  is  possible  to  choose  the  speed  of  the
       deformation.   Furthermore,  it  is  possible  to  switch  the  deformation  off.  It is also possible to
       determine the initial deformation of the immersion.  This is mostly useful if the deformation is switched
       off, in which case it will determine the appearance of the surface.  A value  of  0  corresponds  to  the
       Etruscan  Venus  surface, a value of 1000 to the Roman surface, a value of 2000 to the Boy surface, and a
       value of 3000 to the Ida surface.

       This program is inspired by George K. Francis's book "A  Topological  Picturebook",  Springer,  1987,  by
       George  K.  Francis's  paper  "The  Etruscan  Venus" in P. Concus, R. Finn, and D. A. Hoffman: "Geometric
       Analysis and Computer Graphics", Springer, 1991, and by a video entitled "The Etruscan Venus" by Donna J.
       Cox, George K. Francis, and Raymond L. Idaszak, presented at SIGGRAPH 1989.

       The following options determine whether the surface is being deformed.

       <b>--deform</b>
               Deform the surface smoothly between the Etruscan  Venus  surface,  the  Roman  surface,  the  Boy
               surface surface, and the Ida surface (default).

       <b>--no-deform</b>
               Don't deform the surface.

       The following option determines the deformation speed.

       <b>--deformation-speed</b> <u>float</u>
               The deformation speed is measured in percent of some sensible maximum speed (default: 10.0).

       The  following  options  determine  the  initial deformation of the surface.  As described above, this is
       mostly useful if <b>--no-deform</b> is specified.

       <b>--initial-deformation</b> <u>float</u>
               The initial deformation is specified as a number between 0 and 4000.  A value of 0 corresponds to
               the Etruscan Venus surface, a value of 1000 to the Roman surface, a value  of  2000  to  the  Boy
               surface, and a value of 3000 to the Ida surface.  The default value is 0.

       <b>--etruscan-venus</b>
               This is a shortcut for <b>--initial-deformation</b> <b>0</b>.

       <b>--roman</b> This is a shortcut for <b>--initial-deformation</b> <b>1000</b>.

       <b>--boy</b>   This is a shortcut for <b>--initial-deformation</b> <b>2000</b>.

       <b>--ida</b>   This is a shortcut for <b>--initial-deformation</b> <b>3000</b>.

       The following options determine whether orientation marks are shown on the Klein bottle.

       <b>--orientation-marks</b>
               Display orientation marks on the Klein bottle.

       <b>--no-orientation-marks</b>
               Don't display orientation marks on the Klein bottle (default).

       The  following  three  options  are mutually exclusive.  They determine how the Klain bottle is projected
       from 3d to 2d (i.e., to the screen).

       <b>--projection</b> <b>random</b>
               Project the Klein bottle from 3d to 2d using a random projection mode (default).

       <b>--projection</b> <b>perspective</b> (Shortcut: <b>--perspective</b>)
               Project the Klein bottle from 3d to 2d using a perspective projection.

       <b>--projection</b> <b>orthographic</b> (Shortcut: <b>--orthographic</b>)
               Project the Klein bottle from 3d to 2d using an orthographic projection.

       The following three options determine the rotation speed of the Klein bottle around  the  three  possible
       axes.  The rotation speed is measured in degrees per frame.  The speeds should be set to relatively small
       values, e.g., less than 4 in magnitude.  In walk mode, all speeds are ignored.

       <b>--speed-x</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the x axis (default: 1.1).

       <b>--speed-y</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the y axis (default: 1.3).

       <b>--speed-z</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the z axis (default: 1.5).

       The following two options determine the walking speed and direction.

       <b>--walk-direction</b> <u>float</u>
               The  walking  direction  is  measured  as  an  angle  in  degrees in the 2d square that forms the
               coordinate system of the surface of the Klein bottle (default: 83.0).  A value of 0 or 180  means
               that  the  walk  is  along  a circle at a randomly chosen distance from the origin (parallel to a
               distance band).  A value of 90 or 270 means that the walk is directly  along  a  direction  band.
               Any other value results in a curved path along the surface.  As noted above, walking is performed
               only on the Ida surface.

       <b>--walk-speed</b> <u>float</u>
               The walking speed is measured in percent of some sensible maximum speed (default: 20.0).

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTION</b></h4><pre>
       If  you run this program in standalone mode in its turn mode, you can rotate the Klein bottle by dragging
       the mouse while pressing the left mouse button.  This rotates the Klein bottle in  3d.   To  examine  the
       Klein bottle at your leisure, it is best to set all speeds to 0.  Otherwise, the Klein bottle will rotate
       while the left mouse button is not pressed.  This kind of interaction is not available in the walk mode.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> to get the default host and display number.

       <b>XENVIRONMENT</b>
               to  get  the  name  of  a  resource  file  that  overrides  the  global  resources  stored in the
               RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

       <b>XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW</b>
               The window ID to use with <u>--root</u>.
