</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>romanboy</u> program shows a 3d immersion of the real projective plane that smoothly deforms between the
       Roman surface and the Boy surface.  You can walk on the projective plane  or  turn  in  3d.   The  smooth
       deformation  (homotopy)  between these two famous immersions of the real projective plane was constructed
       by François Apéry.

       The real projective plane is a non-orientable surface.  To make this apparent, the two-sided  color  mode
       can  be  used.   Alternatively, orientation markers (curling arrows) can be drawn as a texture map on the
       surface of the projective plane.  While walking on  the  projective  plane,  you  will  notice  that  the
       orientation of the curling arrows changes (which it must because the projective plane is non-orientable).

       The  real  projective plane is a model for the projective geometry in 2d space.  One point can be singled
       out as the origin.  A line can be singled out as the line at infinity, i.e.,  a  line  that  lies  at  an
       infinite  distance  to  the  origin.   The  line  at infinity, like all lines in the projective plane, is
       topologically a circle.  Points on the line at infinity are also used to model directions  in  projective
       geometry.   The  origin  can  be  visualized in different manners.  When using distance colors (and using
       static colors), the origin is the point that is displayed as fully saturated red, which is easier to  see
       as the center of the reddish area on the projective plane.  Alternatively, when using distance bands, the
       origin is the center of the only band that projects to a disk.  When using direction bands, the origin is
       the  point  where  all  direction bands collapse to a point.  Finally, when orientation markers are being
       displayed, the origin the the point where all orientation markers are compressed to a point.  The line at
       infinity can also be visualized in different ways.  When using distance colors (and using static colors),
       the line at infinity is the line that is displayed as  fully  saturated  magenta.   When  two-sided  (and
       static)  colors  are used, the line at infinity lies at the points where the red and green "sides" of the
       projective plane meet (of course, the real projective plane only has one side, so this is a design choice
       of the visualization).  Alternatively, when orientation markers are being displayed, the line at infinity
       is the place where the orientation markers change their orientation.

       Note that when the projective plane is displayed with bands, the orientation markers are  placed  in  the
       middle  of the bands.  For distance bands, the bands are chosen in such a way that the band at the origin
       is only half as wide as the remaining bands, which results in a disk being displayed at the  origin  that
       has  the  same  diameter  as  the  remaining  bands.  This choice, however, also implies that the band at
       infinity is half as wide as the other bands.  Since the projective plane is  attached  to  itself  (in  a
       complicated  fashion)  at  the line at infinity, effectively the band at infinity is again as wide as the
       remaining bands.  However, since the orientation markers are displayed in the middle of the  bands,  this
       means  that  only  one half of the orientation markers will be displayed twice at the line at infinity if
       distance bands are used.  If direction bands are used or if the projective plane is displayed as a  solid
       surface, the orientation markers are displayed fully at the respective sides of the line at infinity.

       The  immersed  projective  plane can be projected to the screen either perspectively or orthographically.
       When using the walking modes, perspective projection to the screen will be used.

       There are three display modes  for  the  projective  plane:  mesh  (wireframe),  solid,  or  transparent.
       Furthermore,  the  appearance of the projective plane can be as a solid object or as a set of see-through
       bands.  The bands can be distance bands, i.e., bands that lie at increasing distances from the origin, or
       direction bands, i.e., bands that lie at increasing angles with respect to the origin.

       When the projective plane is displayed with direction bands, you will be able to see that each  direction
       band (modulo the "pinching" at the origin) is a Moebius strip, which also shows that the projective plane
       is non-orientable.

       Finally, the colors with with the projective plane is drawn can be set to one-sided, two-sided, distance,
       or  direction.  In one-sided mode, the projective plane is drawn with the same color on both "sides."  In
       two-sided mode (using static colors), the projective plane is drawn with red on one "side" and  green  on
       the  "other  side."   As described above, the projective plane only has one side, so the color jumps from
       red to green along the line at infinity.  This mode enables you to see that the projective plane is  non-
       orientable.  If changing colors are used in two-sided mode, changing complementary colors are used on the
       respective "sides."  In distance mode, the projective plane is displayed with fully saturated colors that
       depend  on  the distance of the points on the projective plane to the origin.  If static colors are used,
       the origin is displayed in red, while the line at infinity is displayed in magenta.   If  the  projective
       plane  is  displayed as distance bands, each band will be displayed with a different color.  In direction
       mode, the projective plane is displayed with fully saturated colors that  depend  on  the  angle  of  the
       points  on  the projective plane with respect to the origin.  Angles in opposite directions to the origin
       (e.g., 15 and 205 degrees) are displayed in the same color since they are  projectively  equivalent.   If
       the projective plane is displayed as direction bands, each band will be displayed with a different color.

       The rotation speed for each of the three coordinate axes around which the projective plane rotates can be
       chosen.

       Furthermore,  in the walking mode the walking direction in the 2d base square of the projective plane and
       the walking speed can be chosen.  The walking direction is measured as an angle  in  degrees  in  the  2d
       square  that  forms  the  coordinate  system of the surface of the projective plane.  A value of 0 or 180
       means that the walk is along a circle at a randomly chosen  distance  from  the  origin  (parallel  to  a
       distance  band).   A  value  of  90 or 270 means that the walk is directly from the origin to the line at
       infinity and back (analogous to a direction band).  Any other value results in a  curved  path  from  the
       origin to the line at infinity and back.

       By  default,  the  immersion  of  the  real  projective  plane smoothly deforms between the Roman and Boy
       surfaces.  It is possible to choose the speed of the deformation.  Furthermore, it is possible to  switch
       the deformation off.  It is also possible to determine the initial deformation of the immersion.  This is
       mostly  useful  if the deformation is switched off, in which case it will determine the appearance of the
       surface.

       As a final option, it is possible to display generalized versions of the  immersion  discussed  above  by
       specifying the order of the surface.  The default surface order of 3 results in the immersion of the real
       projective  described above.  The surface order can be chosen between 2 and 9.  Odd surface orders result
       in generalized immersions of the real projective plane, while even numbers result in  a  immersion  of  a
       topological  sphere (which is orientable).  The most interesting even case is a surface order of 2, which
       results in an immersion of the halfway model of Morin's sphere eversion (if the deformation  is  switched
       off).

       This program is inspired by François Apéry's book "Models of the Real Projective Plane", Vieweg, 1987.

               the origin.

       The following four options are mutually exclusive.  They determine how to color the projective plane.

       <b>--colors</b> <b>random</b>
               Display the projective plane with a random color scheme (default).

       <b>--colors</b> <b>onesided</b> (Shortcut: <b>--onesided-colors</b>)

               the "other side."  For static colors, the colors are red  and  green.   Note  that  the  line  at
               infinity  lies  at the points where the red and green "sides" of the projective plane meet, i.e.,
               where the orientation of the projective plane reverses.

       <b>--colors</b> <b>distance</b> (Shortcut: <b>--distance-colors</b>)
               Display the projective plane with fully saturated colors that  depend  on  the  distance  of  the
               points on the projective plane to the origin.  For static colors, the origin is displayed in red,
               while  the  line  at  infinity  is displayed in magenta.  If the projective plane is displayed as
               distance bands, each band will be displayed with a different color.

       <b>--colors</b> <b>direction</b> (Shortcut: <b>--direction-colors</b>)
               Display the projective plane with fully saturated colors that depend on the angle of  the  points
               on  the projective plane with respect to the origin.  Angles in opposite directions to the origin
               (e.g., 15 and 205  degrees)  are  displayed  in  the  same  color  since  they  are  projectively
               equivalent.  If the projective plane is displayed as direction bands, each band will be displayed
               with a different color.

       The  following  options  determine  whether  the  colors with which the projective plane is displayed are
       static or are changing dynamically.

       <b>--change-colors</b>
               Change the colors with which the projective plane is displayed dynamically.

       <b>--no-change-colors</b>
               Use static colors to display the projective plane (default).

       The following three options are mutually exclusive.  They determine how to view the projective plane.

       <b>--view-mode</b> <b>random</b>

       <b>--view-mode</b> <b>turn</b> (Shortcut: <b>--turn</b>)
               View the projective plane while it turns in 3d.

       <b>--view-mode</b> <b>walk</b> (Shortcut: <b>--walk</b>)
               View the projective plane as if walking on its surface.

       The following options determine whether the surface is being deformed.

       <b>--deform</b>
               Deform the surface smoothly between the Roman and Boy surfaces (default).

       <b>--no-deform</b>
               Don't deform the surface.

       The following option determines the deformation speed.

       <b>--deformation-speed</b> <u>float</u>
               The deformation speed is measured in percent of some sensible maximum speed (default: 10.0).

       The following options determine the initial deformation of the surface.   As  described  above,  this  is
       mostly useful if <b>--no-deform</b> is specified.

       <b>--initial-deformation</b> <u>float</u>
               The initial deformation is specified as a number between 0 and 1000.  A value of 0 corresponds to
               the  Roman  surface,  while a value of 1000 corresponds to the Boy surface.  The default value is
               1000.

       <b>--roman</b> This is a shortcut for <b>--initial-deformation</b> <b>0</b>.

       <b>--boy</b>   This is a shortcut for <b>--initial-deformation</b> <b>1000</b>.

       The following option determines the order of the surface to be displayed.

       <b>--surface-order</b> <u>number</u>
               The surface order can be set to values between 2 and 9 (default: 3).   As  described  above,  odd
               surface  orders result in generalized immersions of the real projective plane, while even numbers
               result in a immersion of a topological sphere.

       The following options determine whether orientation marks are shown on the projective plane.

       <b>--orientation-marks</b>
               Display orientation marks on the projective plane.

       <b>--no-orientation-marks</b>
               Don't display orientation marks on the projective plane (default).

       The following three options are mutually exclusive.  They determine how the projective plane is projected
       from 3d to 2d (i.e., to the screen).

       <b>--projection</b> <b>random</b>
               Project the projective plane from 3d to 2d using a random projection mode (default).

       <b>--projection</b> <b>perspective</b> (Shortcut: <b>--perspective</b>)
               Project the projective plane from 3d to 2d using a perspective projection.

       <b>--projection</b> <b>orthographic</b> (Shortcut: <b>--orthographic</b>)
               Project the projective plane from 3d to 2d using an orthographic projection.

       The following three options determine the rotation  speed  of  the  projective  plane  around  the  three
       possible  axes.   The  rotation  speed  is  measured  in  degrees per frame.  The speeds should be set to
       relatively small values, e.g., less than 4 in magnitude.  In walk mode, all speeds are ignored.

       <b>--speed-x</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the x axis (default: 1.1).

       <b>--speed-y</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the y axis (default: 1.3).

       <b>--speed-z</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the z axis (default: 1.5).

       The following two options determine the walking speed and direction.

       <b>--walk-direction</b> <u>float</u>
               The walking direction is measured as an angle  in  degrees  in  the  2d  square  that  forms  the
               coordinate  system  of  the surface of the projective plane (default: 83.0).  A value of 0 or 180
               means that the walk is along a circle at a randomly chosen distance from the origin (parallel  to
               a  distance  band).   A value of 90 or 270 means that the walk is directly from the origin to the
               line at infinity and back (analogous to a direction band).  Any other value results in  a  curved
               path from the origin to the line at infinity and back.

       <b>--walk-speed</b> <u>float</u>
               The walking speed is measured in percent of some sensible maximum speed (default: 20.0).

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTION</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  run  this  program  in  standalone mode in its turn mode, you can rotate the projective plane by
       dragging the mouse while pressing the left mouse button.  This rotates the projective plane  in  3d.   To
       examine  the  projective  plane  at  your  leisure,  it  is  best to set all speeds to 0.  Otherwise, the
       projective plane will rotate while the left mouse button is not pressed.  This kind of interaction is not
       available in the walk mode.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> to get the default host and display number.

       <b>XENVIRONMENT</b>
               to get the  name  of  a  resource  file  that  overrides  the  global  resources  stored  in  the
               RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

       <b>XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW</b>
               The window ID to use with <u>--root</u>.
