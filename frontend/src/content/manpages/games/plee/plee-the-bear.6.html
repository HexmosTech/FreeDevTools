</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       plee-the-bear — 2D platform game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>plee-the-bear</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Plee  the  Bear  is  a 2D platform game like those we found on consoles in the beginning of the 90's. The
       basis of the scenario fit in few lines:

       Plee the Bear wakes up late one afternoon after dreaming of his earlier years, when  he  traveled  across
       the world with his belle at his side. Craving an afternoon snack, he sticks his arm in a nearby honey pot
       —  only  to  find it empty! Upon discovering that all the pots in his house are empty, Plee thinks of his
       mischievous son and swears, "I'm gonna find that boy and give him the wallop he deserves."

       Following honey drops left on the ground, Plee reaches the edge of the forest, and his adventure begins.

       The current version is a demo.
