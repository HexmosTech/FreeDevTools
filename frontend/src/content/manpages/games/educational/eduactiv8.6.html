</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The game will start by default in windowed mode, but it can  be  changed  into  a  fullscreen  mode.  The
       configuration will be maintained whenever it is started again later.

       Initially  a  login  screen will be presented to the user. Users can either create an offline account for
       themselves or use the default Guest account. When logging into the game a desired age (school  year)  can
       be selected to fine tune the difficulty of activities.

       When logged in, the game will present a starting screen with 3 main groups of categories of activities to
       choose from. When a group is selected a list of all categories suitable for previously selected age group
       will be shown. Further selection of a category will display a list of available activities. Upon clicking
       on  an  activity  icon it will start taking up the whole screen. A back button is located in the top left
       corner to go back to the previous screen.

       There are two steps to selecting a language. The language selected on the login screen  will  change  the
       language  of  the  login  screen  only,  but also will be used as a default language for new users. After
       logging in individual users can choose a different language - the icon to access the  language  selection
       screen is located in the bottom left corner of the home screen - the language selected here will be saved
       for each user individually. This allows users to use the program to learn other languages.
