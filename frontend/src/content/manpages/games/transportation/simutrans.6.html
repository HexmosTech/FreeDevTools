</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       simutrans - transportation simulator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>simutrans</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>simutrans</b> command.

       <b>simutrans</b>  is  a  freeware  transportation  simulator  that  runs  under  Windows, Linux, and a few other
       operating systems (Mac with Intel processors, BEOS).

       You take on the role of operating a transportation company, and your goal is  to  get  goods  of  various
       kinds, as well as passengers and mail, from one place to the next.

       Don't  be fooled by the tile-based graphics - this is a very complex game, and it is constantly evolving,
       with new features being added. It is a living game, and consistently being made better and better.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  a  list  of  the  most  useful  options.   A  list   of   all   options   can   be   found   in
