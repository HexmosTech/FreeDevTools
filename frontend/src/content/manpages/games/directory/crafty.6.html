</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       crafty - chess engine

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>crafty</b> [<b>bookpath=</b>&lt;<u>directory</u>&gt;] [<b>logpath=</b>&lt;<u>directory</u>&gt;]
       [<b>tbpath=</b>&lt;<u>directory-list</u>&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Crafty</b>  is  a  chess  "engine".   That  is,  the  program concerns itself with playing chess and not with
       providing a graphic user interface.  Thus <b>Crafty</b> is commonly invoked indirectly via <b>XBoard</b>,  and  current
       versions of these programs generally work very well together.  Some noteworthy features of <b>Crafty</b> are:

       *  Source  code,  provided, is unusually deserving of study.  The author has sought to provide a starting
          point for others writing  chess-playing  programs,  leading  to  clean  and  portable  code.   Another
          objective has been to maintain a state-of-the-art chess engine, with the result that some parts of the
          source code may be challenging to understand.

       *  Flexible  and  powerful  command-line interface.  About the only thing that can <u>not</u> be done within the
          CLI is changing various paths determining where <b>Crafty</b> reads and writes various  files.   This  manual
          page focuses on explaining these paths.

       *  Easy graphic user interface via <b><a href="../man6/xboard.6.html">xboard</a></b>(6).

       *  Informative  log  files.   Writes  "game.nnn" file storing current game in PGN format, and also writes
          "log.nnn" file recording what the engine was "thinking".

       *  Intelligent opening play.  <b>Crafty</b> learns from experience, and makes appropriate modifications  to  its
          opening  book.   The  "book"  command  allows  generation  of  an  opening  book  (from PGN data), and
          customization of how it is used.  The learning facilities synthesize several different approaches, and
          allow various ways for the user to customize and follow what is  being  learned.  Additional  commands
          allow  easy  creation  of  files  to customize how <b>Crafty</b> plays the opening against humans and against
          other computer programs.

       *  Uses endgame tablebases.  Precompiled tablebases in the appropriate  format  are  freely  downloadable
          from <a href="ftp://ftp.cis.uab.edu/hyatt/TB">ftp://ftp.cis.uab.edu/hyatt/TB</a>.

       *  Polished  and powerful facilities for Internet play (for which the program continues to be extensively
          used).  Note that the licencing forbids concealing Crafty under another name, or unauthorized entry of
          it in a tournament in which other computer programs have been invited to compete.

       *  Annotation.  Generates either PGN  or  HTML  files,  in  a  manner  made  very  flexible  by  choosing
          appropriate aptions to the "annotate | annotateh" command.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  command line arguments, &lt;<u>directory-spec</u>&gt; is a path to a directory, whereas &lt;<u>directory-list</u>&gt; is a
       non-empty sequence of paths to directories.  For portability, several different characters are  taken  as
       path separators: the colon (:), the semicolon (;), and the comma (,).

       There  are  actually  four  of these: <b>bookpath</b> is where Crafty seeks its opening books and writes learned
       knowledge; <b>logpath</b> is where Crafty normally writes a pair of files "game.nnn" and "log.nnn" for each game
       it plays; <b>rcpath</b> is where Crafty looks for a run control file to be read only; and <b>tbpath</b> is where Crafty
       looks for endgame tablebase files to be read only.

       The four path specifications have a number of things in common:  each has a default value set when <b>Crafty</b>
       is compiled, which can then be modified by the appropriate environment variable, and can  then  again  be
       modified  by an invocation argument, but can <u>not</u> be modified after the engine has been initialized (thus,
       in particular, it is not possible to modify the paths by editing a run control file).  Possibly the  best
       procedure is to avoid the invocation options, experiment with the environment variables, and then perhaps
       recompile  the  program  with  different defaults.  Note that if the program is compiled "out of the box"
       then all four values default to "./" (the directory in which <b>Crafty</b> has been launched).

       Crafty can be invoked with other arguments (such as "xboard" to indicate that  Crafty  is  being  invoked
       through <b><a href="../man6/xboard.6.html">xboard</a></b>(6)) which would not usually be used directly.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Crafty</b>'s  extensive  command-line  interface  is  defined  in  "option.c", discussed in "crafty.doc", and
       briefly described by the command "help".

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Run</b> <b>control</b>
       Crafty tries to read a run control file <b>rcpath</b>/.craftyrc.  (On a non-Unix system, ".craftyrc" changes  to
       "crafty.rc".)   Such a file should contain a sequence of valid Crafty commands, terminated by the command
       "exit" to restore standard input to the keyboard.  See <b><a href="../man5/craftyrc.5.html">craftyrc</a></b>(5) for a skeletal example.

   <b>Logging</b>
       When a game is played, Crafty normally writes "<b>logpath</b>/game.&lt;nnn&gt;" and  "<b>logpath</b>/log.&lt;nnn&gt;".  Details  of
       what  is  written  are  modifiable  by  the  `log' command. Because $CRAFTY_LOG_DIR defaults to "./" (the
       directory in which Crafty is launched), trouble can occur if the program is launched in  a  directory  to
       which  it  is unable to write.  Note that the "log.&lt;nnn&gt;" file normally contains all output that would be
       visible if <b>Crafty</b> were run from the command line but is usually hidden when it is run from a GUI.

   <b>Opening</b> <b>books</b>
       Crafty is designed to maintain its chess opening knowledge in a file "book.bin", and to modify this  file
       as  it  learns  from  its mistakes.  Refer to the documentation for the "book" command for information on
       generating and customizing usage of "book.bin".

       Further, files "books.bin" and "bookc.bin" allow easy customization of  Crafty's  opening  play  (against
       humans and computer, respectively).  See the documentation for the "books" command.

       Finally,  there  are  several  files  "*.lrn"  for  synopses  of  what Crafty has been learning.  See the
       documentation for the "learn" command.

   <b>Endgame</b> <b>tablebases</b>
       When normally configured, Crafty reads late endgame knowledge from "*.emd" files, which are  distance-to-
       mate tablebases.  See the documentation for the "egtb" command.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CRAFTY_BOOK_PATH</b>
       If  <b>$CRAFTY_BOOK_PATH</b>  is  set,  it  overrides  the  compiled  value  of  <b>bookpath</b>, the path to directory
       containing "book.bin" and friends.  Unless learning has been disabled, Crafty will  be  writing  in  this
       directory.

   <b>CRAFTY_LOG_PATH</b>
       If  <b>$CRAFTY_LOG_PATH</b>  is  set,  it  overrides  the  compiled  value of <b>logpath</b>, the path to directory for
       writing, but not reading, the log files.

   <b>CRAFTY_RC_PATH</b>
       If <b>$CRAFTY_RC_PATH</b> is set, it overrides the compiled value of <b>rcpath</b>, the path to directory for  reading,
       but not writing, a run control file (".craftyrc" or "crafty.rc").

   <b>CRAFTY_TB_PATH</b>
       If  <b>$CRAFTY_TB_PATH</b>  is  set,  it  overrides  the  compiled  value  of  <b>tbpath</b>,  the sequence of paths to
       directories for reading, but not writing, endgame tablebase files.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Crafty</b> is the son of <b>Cray</b> <b>Blitz</b>, also written by Bob Hyatt.  The subsequent history of <b>Crafty</b> is detailed
       in the source file "main.c".  Opening  books  appeared  in  version  1.9.  log  files  in  1.11,  endgame
       tablebases in 8.24, run control files in 9.22, and environment variables in 16.5.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  interests of portability, <b>Crafty</b> deals with files in a simple manner, at the cost of robustness.
       Very long or incorrect paths may result in a "segmentation fault" when a file writing operation fails.

       This manual page itself will probably always be flagrantly incomplete in that many  essential,  powerful,
       and interesting aspects of <b>Crafty</b> are not even mentioned.
