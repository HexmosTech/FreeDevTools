</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       netris-sample-robot - sample robot for netris

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>netris-sample-robot</b> [<b>-l</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  netris-sample-robot  is a sample implementation of the robot protocol. It plays quite well but isn't
       too hard to beat. The robot should be started from netris with the option  <b>-r</b>  to  connect  or  wait  for
       another player to join. You can also let two robots play against each other in that way, if you like.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-l</b>     Writes  some  log  information  into the file <b>log</b> in the current working directory. If it can't it
              bails out.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To start the netris-sample-robot waiting for another connection with logfile use the following line:
              netris -w -r 'netris-sample-robot -l'

       You then just have to start netris somewhere else which connects to that robot.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       One known bug of the netris-sample-robot is that it hangs quite often.   This  was  already  filed  as  a
       bugreport against the package so please refrain from doing so again. If you have an idea why this happens
       or know a solution how to fix it feel free to mail us.
