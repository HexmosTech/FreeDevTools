</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       robots — fight off villainous robots

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>robots</b> [<b>-Asjtan</b>] [<u>scorefile</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>robots</b>  pits  you  against  evil  robots,  who  are  trying  to  kill  you  (which is why they are evil).
       Fortunately for you, even though they are evil, they are not very bright and have a habit of bumping into
       each other, thus destroying themselves.  In order to survive, you must get them to kill each  other  off,
       since you have no offensive weaponry.

       Since  you  are stuck without offensive weaponry, you are endowed with one piece of defensive weaponry: a
       teleportation device.  When two robots run into each other or a junk pile, they die.   If  a  robot  runs
       into  you,  you die.  When a robot dies, you get 10 points, and when all the robots die, you start on the
       next field.  This keeps up until they finally get you.

       Robots are represented on the screen by a ‘+’, the junk heaps from their collisions by  a  ‘∗’,  and  you
       (the good guy) by a ‘@’.

       The commands are:
       <b>h</b>       move one square left
       <b>l</b>       move one square right
       <b>k</b>       move one square up
       <b>j</b>       move one square down
       <b>y</b>       move one square up and left
       <b>u</b>       move one square up and right
       <b>b</b>       move one square down and left
       <b>n</b>       move one square down and right
       <b>.</b>       (also space) do nothing for one turn
       <b>HJKLBNYU</b>
               run as far as possible in the given direction
       <b>&gt;</b>       do nothing for as long as possible
       <b>t</b>       teleport to a random location
       <b>w</b>       wait until you die or they all do
       <b>q</b>       quit
       <b>^L</b>      redraw the screen

       All commands can be preceded by a count.

       If  you  use  the  ‘<b>w</b>’  command and survive to the next level, you will get a bonus of 10% for each robot
       which died after you decided to wait.  If you die, however, you get nothing.  For all other commands, the
       program will save you from typos by stopping short of being eaten.  However, with ‘<b>w</b>’ you take  the  risk
       of dying by miscalculation.

       Only five scores are allowed per user on the score file.  If you make it into the score file, you will be
       shown  the  list  at  the  end of the game.  If an alternative score file is specified, that will be used
       instead of the standard file for scores.

       The options are

       <b>-s</b>      Don't play, just show the score file.

       <b>-j</b>      Jump, <u>i.e.</u>, when you run, don't show any intermediate positions; only show  things  at  the  end.
               This is useful on slow terminals.

       <b>-t</b>      Teleport  automatically  when you have no other option.  This is a little disconcerting until you
               get used to it, and then it is very nice.

       <b>-a</b>      Advance into the higher levels directly, skipping the lower, easier levels.

       <b>-A</b>      Auto-bot mode.  Lets the game play itself.

       <b>-n</b>      Increase the number of games played by one.
