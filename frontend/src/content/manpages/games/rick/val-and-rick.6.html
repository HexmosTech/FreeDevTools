</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       val-and-rick - shooter game

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Val  and  Rick  is  probably  the  precursor  to  Gunroar,  featuring similar controls but in a different
       environment. Only 2D sprites and backgrounds are used in what seems like a tribute to  Xevious  and  Star
       Soldier.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These options are available:

       <b>-brightness</b> <b>n</b>
              Set the brightness of the screen.(n = 0 - 100, default = 100)

       <b>-luminous</b> <b>n</b>
              Set the luminous intensity.(n = 0 - 100, default = 50)

       <b>-nosound</b>
              Stop the sound.

       <b>-window</b>
              Launch the game in a window.

       <b>-fullscreen</b>
              Launch the game in fullscreen.

       <b>-res</b> <b>width</b> <b>height</b>
              Sets the resolution of the screen in pixels.

       <b>-nosound</b>

       <b>-nowait</b>

       <b>-accframe</b>

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Press the Z key to shoot and hold down the X key to fix the direction of your aim.

       A  power-up  icon in the shape of a tiny ship named Rick will appear if you collect enough blue orbs from
       defeated enemies, which is indicated at the bottom left of the screen. This will cause your  ship  to  go
       into  hyperdrive,  that  is until all energy is spent or your spacecraft takes damage from enemy bullets.
       Each successful hyperdrive attempt increases the counter by another hundred.

       The X key can also be used to drop bombs on grounded objects. Tap the P key to  pause.  The  closer  your
       ship is to the top of the screen, the faster it scrolls.
