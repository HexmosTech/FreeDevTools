</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pipenightdreams - Just another pipe trip (PipeDream clon).

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        <b>pipenightdreams</b> [--datadir &lt;DATADIR&gt;] [--fullscreen]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
        <b>pipenightdreams</b>  is  a PipeDream style game. The objetive of the game is to carry liquid from some point
       to the exit using different kinds of pipes. On each level there is a minimum  number  of  required  pipes
       that should be at least reached for it to be completed.

       The  score  is  increased by using as many pipes as possible an by collecting various bonus tokens making
       the liquid pass through their pipes. There are also life bonus and, hopefully soon, "freeze tokens".

       The game is not exactly a copy of PipeDream. It's based only on the facts I remember and  on  many  other
       things which have been added, or changed hoping for making it better.

   <b>KEYS</b>
       The game is entirely played using the keyboard and the key layout is as follows:

       SPACE  Puts the next pipe where the pointer is.

       CURSOR KEYS
              Move the pointer.

       ENTER  Speeds up the liquid (Avoids skillful players to get bored).

       ESC    Goes back to the main screen or exits.

   <b>BONUS</b> <b>TYPES</b>
       The various types of bonus tokens are the following:

       LIFE BONUS
              The purple one with a "L" on it.

       SUPER BONUS
              The red one with a "B" on it.

       ULTRA BONUS
              The blue one.

       HYPER BONUS
              The green one.
