</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       garden - Garden of Coloured Lights

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>garden</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Garden of Coloured Lights is an abstract vertical shooter with music elements.  The enemies, in fact, are
       kind  of  musical.  Part  of  what stands out about Garden of Coloured Lights are its graphics, that even
       though are kept quite simple, are also carefully taken care of. Every ship still  has  moving  parts  and
       mechanisms  that  open  and  close,  and every level is different, even though all of them share a common
       theme.

</pre><h4><b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Left,</b> <b>Right,</b> <b>Up,</b> <b>Down</b>
              move the fighter across the screen

       <b>Z</b>      fire weapon 1

       <b>X</b>      fire weapon 2

       <b>C</b>      fire weapon 3

       <b>V</b>      slow down movement

       Key controls can be modified inside the game options menu.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>garden</b> doesn't accept any command line arguments. Configuration is via the file <b><a href="file:~/.garden/init.txt">~/.garden/init.txt</a></b>, which
       also records scores and configured key controls.

       The following configuration can only be done by editing <b>init.txt</b> (under the heading <b>[Misc]</b>):

       <b>Windowed</b>
              Use <b>Windowed</b> <b>=</b> <b>0</b> for fullscreen, <b>Windowed</b> <b>=</b> <b>1</b> to run in a window (default).

       <b>vsync</b>  Turning vsync on (<b>vsync</b> <b>=</b> <b>1</b>) eliminates a graphic shearing effect which  some  people  might  find
              annoying, but can slow things down on older systems.  Default is <b>vsync</b> <b>=</b> <b>0</b>.
