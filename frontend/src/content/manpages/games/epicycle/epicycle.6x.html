</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  epicycle  program draws the path traced out by a point on the edge of a circle.  That circle rotates
       around a point on the rim of another circle, and so on, several times.  The random curves produced can be
       simple or complex, convex or concave, but they are always closed curves (they never go in indefinitely).

       You can configure both the way the curves are drawn and the way in which the random sequence  of  circles
       is generated, either with command-line options or X resources.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--display</b> <u>host:display.screen</u>
               Specifies  which  X  display  we  should  use  (see  the  section  DISPLAY NAMES in <b><a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a></b>(1) for more
               information about this option).

       <b>--root</b>  Draw on the root window.

       <b>--window-id</b> <u>number</u>
               Draw on the specified window.

       <b>--window</b>
               Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       <b>--mono</b>  If on a color display, pretend we're on a monochrome display.  If we're on  a  mono  display,  we
               have no choice.

       <b>--install</b>
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       <b>--noinstall</b>
               Don't install a private colormap for the window.

       <b>--visual</b> <u>viz</u>
               Specify  which  visual  to  use.   Legal  values are the name of a visual class, or the id number
               (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.  Possible choices include

               default,  best,  mono,  monochrome,  gray,  grey,  color,  staticgray,  staticcolor,   truecolor,
               grayscale, greyscale, pseudocolor, directcolor, <u>number</u>

               If  a  decimal  or  hexadecimal  number  is  used,  <b><a href="../man3X/XGetVisualInfo.3X.html">XGetVisualInfo</a></b>(3X) is consulted to obtain the
               required visual.

       <b>--colors</b> <u>N</u>
               How many colors should be used (if possible).  The colors are chosen randomly.

       <b>--foreground</b> <u>name</u>
               With <b>--mono</b>, this option selects the foreground colour.

       <b>--delay</b> <u>microseconds</u>
               Specifies the delay between drawing successive line segments of the path.   If you do not specify
               <b>-sync</b>, some X servers may batch up several drawing operations together, producing a  less  smooth
               effect.    This is more likely to happen in monochrome mode (on monochrome servers or when <b>--mono</b>
               is specified).

       <b>--holdtime</b> <u>seconds</u>
               When the figure is complete, <u>epicycle</u> pauses this number of seconds.

       <b>--linewidth</b> <u>N</u>
               Width in pixels of the body's track.   Specifying  values  greater  than  one  may  cause  slower
               drawing.   The fastest value is usually zero, meaning one pixel.

       <b>--min_circles</b> <u>N</u>
               Smallest number of epicycles in the figure.

       <b>--max_circles</b> <u>N</u>
               Largest number of epicycles in the figure.

       <b>--min_speed</b> <u>number</u>
               Smallest  possible value for the base speed of revolution of the epicycles.  The actual speeds of
               the epicycles vary from this down to <u>min_speed</u> <u>/</u> <u>harmonics</u><b>.</b>

       <b>--max_speed</b> <u>number</u>
               Smallest possible value for the base speed of revolution of the epicycles.

       <b>--harmonics</b> <u>N</u>
               Number of possible harmonics; the larger this value is,  the  greater  the  possible  variety  of
               possible speeds of epicycle.

       <b>--timestep</b> <u>number</u>
               Decreasing  this  value  will  reduce the distance the body moves for each line segment, possibly
               producing a smoother figure.  Increasing it may produce faster results.

       <b>--divisor_poisson</b> <u>probability</u>
               Each epicycle rotates at a rate which is a factor of the base speed.  The speed of each  epicycle
               is  the  base  speed  divided  by some integer between 1 and the value of the <b>--harmonics</b> option.
               This integer is decided by starting at 1 and tossing a biased coin.  For each  consecutive  head,
               the  value  is  incremented  by  one.  The integer will not be incremented above the value of the
               <b>--harmonics</b> option.  The argument of this option  decides  the  bias  of  the  coin;  it  is  the
               probability that that coin will produce a head at any given toss.

       <b>--size_factor_min</b> <u>number</u>
               Epicycles are always at least this factor smaller than their parents.

       <b>--size_factor_max</b> <u>number</u>
               Epicycles are never more than this factor smaller than their parents.

       <b>--fps</b>   Display   the   current   frame   rate  and  CPU  load.   <b>--timestep</b>  option  multiplied  by  the
               timestepCoarseFactor resource.  The default value of 1 will almost always work fast enough and so
               this resource is not available as a command-line option.

</pre><h4><b>USER</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       The program runs mostly without user interaction.  When running on the root window, no input is accepted.
       When running in its own window, the program will exit if mouse button 3 is pressed.  If any  other  mouse
       button is pressed, the current figure will be abandoned and another will be started.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The  geometry  of epicycles was perfected by Hipparchus of Rhodes at some time around 125 B.C., 185 years
       after the birth of Aristarchus of Samos, the inventor of the  heliocentric  universe  model.   Hipparchus
       applied  epicycles to the Sun and the Moon.  Ptolemy of Alexandria went on to apply them to what was then
       the known universe, at around 150 A.D.  Copernicus went on to apply them to the heliocentric model at the
       beginning of the sixteenth century.  Johannes  Kepler  discovered  that  the  planets  actually  move  in
       elliptical  orbits  in  about 1602.  The inverse-square law of gravity was suggested by Boulliau in 1645.
       Isaac Newton's <u>Principia</u> <u>Mathematica</u> was published in 1687, and proved that Kepler's  laws  derived  from
       Newtonian gravitation.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  colour  selection  is re-done for every figure.  This may generate too much network traffic for this
       program to work well over slow or long links.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> to get the default host and display number.

       <b>XENVIRONMENT</b>
               to get the  name  of  a  resource  file  that  overrides  the  global  resources  stored  in  the
               RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

       <b>XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW</b>
               The window ID to use with <u>--root</u>.
