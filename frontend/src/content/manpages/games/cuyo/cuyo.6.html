</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cuyo - Tetris-like game with many suprises

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cuyo</b> [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-f</b>] [<b>-g</b> <u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u>] [<b>-h</b>] [<b>-?</b>] [<b>--version</b> <u>versions</u>] [<u>ld-file</u>]

       <b>cuyo</b> <b>-?</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Use  A,  D,  W and S or the arrow keys to move left, move right, turn and drop the falling piece.  Try to
       put blobs of the same color together.  (You don't need to form rows or  columns.   Any  shape  will  do.)
       When  enough  blobs  of  the same color are connected, they explode.  (What "enough" means depends on the
       level.)  Try to make explosions next to the the grass (or whatever there is in the level instead  of  the
       grass).  Then, it will explode, too.  The level is finished when no grass is left.
       In some levels, you will need a chain reaction to get rid of the grass-equivalent.  And many other things
       may happen in other levels.
       In  two-player-mode,  each  time  one  player  causes an explosion, the other one gets grey things (which
       explode when something else explodes next to them).  If one player builds a  too  big  tower,  the  other
       player may get one of his rows.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b>     Debug mode.

       <b>-f</b>     Fullscreen mode.

       <b>-g</b> <u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u>
              Set the window size.

       <b>-h</b>     Print a short help message and exit with status 0.

       <b>-?</b>     Print a short help message and exit with status 1.

       <b>--version</b> <u>versions</u>, <b>--version=</b><u>versions</u>
              Activate  special  versions  of  levels  and  level tracks.  <u>versions</u> is a comma-separated list of
              version specifiers.  Version specifiers pertaining to difficulty setting, numbers of players,  and
              level tracks can also be set from the main menu.  See the <b><a href="../man6/cual.6.html">cual</a></b>(6) manpage for the relevant values.
              The other version specifiers which are actually used in levels are <b>eco</b> and <b>geek</b>.

              <b>eco</b>  makes  a  very  few  levels  less resource-hungry.  In the consequence, they also become less
              beautiful.

       If you're trying to design own levels, you can pass the name of your .ld file (level description file) to
       test the level.  If you do that, this will be the only available level.

</pre><h4><b>CREATING</b> <b>NEW</b> <b>LEVELS</b></h4><pre>
       The main work is to draw all those little icons.  Then you have to create a level description file  which
       tells  cuyo  how  to  put  everything  together.   There  is  an  example  level with many comments.  Its
       description file is <b>example.ld</b>.  (It should be part of the cuyo distribution and  probably  lies  in  the
       same directory as the other cuyo level description files.)  It is rather outdated but may still be a good
       starting point.

       Other Sources of information are:

       - Try <u>man</u> <u>cual</u>.  Cual - the Cuyo Animation Language - is the format of level description files.

       - And  of  course,  there  are  the  level description files of the existing levels (files ending in <u>.ld</u>,
         probably located somewhere like <u>/usr/share/games/cuyo/</u>).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The level description language is still under development.
       In the preferences dialog, some keys are not displayed correctly.
       The AI Player is not very intelligent.  In particular, it doesn't understand most of the special features
       of the levels, and so, it sometimes behaves very silly.
       See the <u>TODO</u> file for other bugs.
