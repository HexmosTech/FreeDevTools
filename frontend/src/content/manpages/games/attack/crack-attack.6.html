</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       crack-attack - multiplayer OpenGL puzzle game like "Tetris Attack"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>crack-attack</b>  { { [<b>--server</b> <u>PORT</u>] | [<b>--wait</b>] } { [<b>SERVER</b>] | [<b>PORT</b>] } { [<b>--solo</b>] [ [<u>--easy</u>] | [<u>--medium</u>] |
       [<u>--hard</u>] ] } } [<b>--name</b> <u>NAME</u>] [<b>-X</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Crack Attack is roughly based on the Super Nintendo game "Tetris Attack". Slowly, your stack  of  colored
       blocks grows from the bottom, and you've got to make sure it never reaches the top. If it does, you lose.
       To eliminate blocks from the stack, line up at least three of one color, horizontally or vertically. Once
       you do, those blocks disappear, and put off slightly your inevitable demise.

       Crack Attack essentially requires hardware acceleration. For Xorg users, this means you want DRI.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>solo</b>   Creates  a  solo  game  versus  yourself. The goal is to gain as many points as possible. If an AI
              level is specified, then the game is played versus a computer  and  the  goal  is  to  defeat  the
              computer player in as little time as possible.
