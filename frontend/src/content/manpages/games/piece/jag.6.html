</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       jag - is a arcade-puzzle 2D game in which you have to break all the target pieces.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Puzzle  game  where  the goal is to break all the target pieces in each level and do this before the time
       runs out.

       Move game pieces using mouse into matches of 3 or more in a straight line horizontally or vertically.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>PLAY</b></h4><pre>
       The aim of JAG is to break all of the target pieces on each level, and to do this before  the  time  runs
       out.  Keep doing this until you have beaten the last level and won the game.

       Doing this on top of the target cells will break them.

       The faster targets are removed, the bigger is score.

       There are single and double targets. Blocks also can be single or double.

       By breaking pieces and targets, you're earning score which can be spent for applying a special tool.

       Tools  make  the  life easier as they're mostly intended for breaking several pieces at a time, including
       blocks and targets.

       By breaking pieces of the same type, you're also increasing bonus counters.  If you will collect 500  and
       more items, you can remove all the same items from the field.

</pre><h4><b>SCORING</b></h4><pre>
       You're  getting  score points for removing game pieces.  Basically, you get 1 point for the ordinary cell
       and 3 points for the target cell.

       The actual points you get are multiplyed by bonus value, so it can be much higher.

       Score bonus is the multiplier which is applyed to every score point you get during the game.   The  bonus
       raises when you remove target cells quickly enough to keep bonus timer run.

       By default, bonus timer is set to 5 seconds, but during the game you can increase this value.

</pre><h4><b>ITEMS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>REWARDS</b></h4><pre>
       Every  level  may  contain  up  to  6  game  items.  The icon of an item depends on current graphic theme
       selected.

       In arcade mode there is a reward, which is given for 500 or more pieces of  collected  items  -  you  can
       eliminate all the items of the collected type from the field.

       You can choose the power of the elimination depending of how many items you collected.

</pre><h4><b>TOOLS</b></h4><pre>
       Tools  are  the  special  rewards that you take for scoring and collecting game items. There are 10 tools
       available in the game (2 in the puzzle mode).

       <b>ITEM:</b>               <b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
       -----               ------------

       Hammer              - Destroys an item in the game field.

       Clock               - Adds +60 seconds to the level timer.

       Nippers             - Removes a single block.

       Star                - Removes item, one block and one target.

       Super Star          - Star with doubled power.

       Bomb                - Explodes a region of 9 cells.

       Mixer               - Randomly mixes items in the field.

       Row Blaster         - Removes items, blocks and targets in a row.

       Twin Blaster        - Removes all items of the selected type.

</pre><h4><b>PERMANENT</b> <b>BONUS</b></h4><pre>
       Unlike tools, permanent bonus, once received, is active for all the further levels.

       Getting permanent bonus of the same type several times increases its power.

       <b>ITEM:</b>                         <b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
       -----                         ------------

       Score Time Bonus              - Permanent extra +1 second to bonus timer.

       Score Magnification Bonus     - Permanent +1 to multiplier value.

       Score Bonus                   - Permanent extra 1 point for the target cell.

       Clock Bonus                   - Permanent extra 30 seconds to level timer.

</pre><h4><b>ARCADE</b> <b>VS</b> <b>PUZZLE</b></h4><pre>
       The are two play modes in the game - arcade and puzzle.

       The difference is - in arcade mode you can get new bonuses for collected items and use all the tools, and
       in puzzle mode you have only two tools (Hammer and Clock).

       Also in the puzzle mode level doesn't fail when the time is over, you may continue, but you won't get any
       bonus points if the time is zero.
