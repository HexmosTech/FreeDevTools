</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       phantasia — an interterminal fantasy game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>phantasia</b> [<b>-abHmpSsx</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>phantasia</b>  is  a  role  playing game which allows players to roll up characters of various types to fight
       monsters and other players.  Progression of characters is based upon  gaining  experience  from  fighting
       monsters (and other players).

       Most of the game is menu driven and self-explanatory (more or less).  The screen is cursor updated, so be
       sure to set up the TERM variable in your environment.

       The options provide for a variety of functions to support the game.  They are:

             <b>-a</b>   Get a listing of all character names on file.

             <b>-b</b>   Show scoreboard of top characters per login.

             <b>-H</b>   Print header only.

             <b>-m</b>   Get a monster listing.

             <b>-p</b>   Purge old characters.

             <b>-S</b>   Turn on wizard options, if allowed, if running as “root”.

             <b>-s</b>   Invokes <b>phantasia</b> without header information.

             <b>-x</b>   Examine/change a particular character on file.

       The  characters  are  saved on a common file, in order to make the game interactive between players.  The
       characters are given a password in order to retrieve them later.  Only characters above  <u>level</u>  zero  are
       saved.   Characters  unused for awhile will be purged.  Characters are only placed on the scoreboard when
       they die.

</pre><h4><b>PARTICULARS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Normal</b> <b>Play</b>
       A number of the player's more important statistics are  almost  always  displayed  on  the  screen,  with
       maximums (where applicable) in parentheses.

       The  character is placed randomly near the center of a Cartesian system.  Most commands are selected with
       a single letter or digit.  For example, one may move by hitting 'W', 'S', 'N', or 'E',  (lower  case  may
       also be used, at no time is the game case dependent).  One may also use 'H', 'J', 'K', 'L', for movement,
       similar  to  <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1).  To move to a specific (x, y) coordinate, use the <b>move</b> ('1') command.  The distance a
       character can move is calculated by 1 plus 1.5 per <u>level</u>.  Moving in a compass direction  will  move  the
       player the maximum allowed distance in that direction.

       A  player  may see who else is playing by using the <b>players</b> ('2') option.  One may see the coordinates of
       those who are the same distance or closer to the origin as he/she.  <u>Kings</u>, and <u>council</u> <u>of</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>wise</u>  can
       see and can be seen by everyone.  A <u>palantir</u> removes these restrictions.

       One  can talk to other players with the <b>talk</b> ('3') option.  In general, this is a line or so of text.  To
       remove a current message, just type ⟨return⟩ when prompted for a message.

       The <b>stats</b> ('4') option shows additional characteristics of a player.

       One may leave the game either with the <b>quit</b> ('5') option.

       One may rest by default.  Resting lets one regain maximum <u>energy</u> <u>level</u>, and also lets one find <u>mana</u> (more
       is found for larger levels and further distances from the origin).

       One may call a monster by hitting '9' or 'C'.

       Use 'X' to examine other players.

       One may quit or execute a sub-shell by hitting interrupt.  Quitting during battle results  in  death  for
       obvious reasons.

       Several  other options become available as the player progresses in <u>level</u> and <u>magic</u>, or to other stations
       in the game (<u>valar</u>, <u>council</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>wise</u>, <u>king</u>).  These are described elsewhere.  In general, a  control-L
       will force the redrawing of the screen.

       Other things which may happen are more or less self-explanatory.

   <b>Fighting</b> <b>Monsters</b>
       A player has several options while fighting monsters.  They are as follows:

             <b>melee</b>     Inflicts  damage  on  the  monster,  based  upon  <u>strength</u>.  Also decreases the monster's
                       <u>strength</u> some.

             <b>skirmish</b>  Inflicts a little less damage than <b>melee</b>, but decreases the monster's <u>quickness</u> instead.

             <b>evade</b>     Attempt to run away.  Success is based upon both the player's and  the  monster's  <u>brains</u>
                       and <u>quickness</u>.

             <b>spell</b>     Several options for throwing spells (described elsewhere).

             <b>nick</b>      Hits  the  monster one plus the player's <u>sword</u>, and gives the player 10% of the monster's
                       <u>experience</u>.  Decreases the monster's <u>experience</u> an  amount  proportional  to  the  amount
                       granted.   This  also increases the monster's quickness.  Paralyzed monsters wake up very
                       fast when nicked.

             <b>luckout</b>   This is essentially a battle of wits  with  the  monster.   Success  is  based  upon  the
                       player's  and  the  monster's  <u>brains</u>.  The player gets credit for slaying the monster if
                       he/she succeeds.  Otherwise, nothing happens, and the chance to <b>luckout</b> is lost.

   <b>Character</b> <b>Statistics</b>
             <u>strength</u>   determines how much damage a character can inflict.

             <u>quickness</u>  determines how many chances a character gets to make decisions while fighting.

             <u>energy</u> <u>level</u>
                        specifies how much damage a character may endure before dying.

             <u>magic</u> <u>level</u>
                        determines which spells a character may throw, and how effective those spells will be.

             <u>brains</u>     basically, the character's intelligence; used for various fighting options and spells.

             <u>mana</u>       used as a power source for throwing spells.

             <u>experience</u>
                        gained by fighting monsters and other characters.

             <u>level</u>      indicative of how much experience a character has accumulated; progresses  geometrically
                        as <u>experience</u> increases.

             <u>poison</u>     sickness which degrades a character's performance (affects <u>energy</u> <u>level</u> and <u>strength</u>).

             <u>sin</u>        accumulated as a character does certain nasty things; used only rarely in normal play of
                        the game.

             <u>age</u>        of  player;  roughly  equivalent  to  number  of turns.  As <u>age</u> increases, many personal
                        statistics degenerate.

   <b>Character</b> <b>Types</b>
       Character statistics are rolled randomly from the above list, according to character type.  The types are
       as follows:

             <u>magic</u> <u>user</u>   strong in <u>magic</u> <u>level</u> and <u>brains</u>, weak in other areas.  Must rely on wits and magic to
                          survive.

             <u>fighter</u>      good in <u>strength</u> and <u>energy</u> <u>level</u>, fairly good in other areas.   This  adds  up  to  a
                          well-equipped fighter.

             <u>elf</u>          very high <u>quickness</u> and above average <u>magic</u> <u>level</u> are <u>elves</u> selling points.

             <u>dwarf</u>        very high <u>strength</u> and <u>energy</u> <u>level</u>, but with a tendency to be rather slow and not too
                          bright.

             <u>halfling</u>     rather  quick and smart, with high <u>energy</u> <u>level</u>, but poor in <u>magic</u> and <u>strength</u>.  Born
                          with some <u>experience</u>.

             <u>experimento</u>  very mediocre in all areas.  However, the <u>experimento</u> may be  placed  almost  anywhere
                          within the playing grid.

       The possible ranges for starting statistics are summarized in the following table.
       Type          Strength   Quick    Mana    Energy   Brains   Magic
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       Mag. User      10-15     30-35   50-100   30-45    60-85     5-9
       Fighter        40-55     30-35   30-50    45-70    25-45     3-6
       Elf            35-45     32-38   45-90    30-50    40-65     4-7
       Dwarf          50-70     25-30   25-45    60-100   20-40     2-5
       Halfling       20-25      34     25-45    55-90    40-75     1-4
       Experimento      25       27      100       35       25       2

       Not   only   are   the  starting  characteristics  different  for  the  different  character  types,  the
       characteristics progress at different rates for the different types as the character goes  up  in  <u>level</u>.
       <u>Experimentoes</u>'  characteristics  progress  randomly  as  one  of  the  other  types.   The progression as
       characters increase in <u>level</u> is summarized in the following table.

       Type        Strength   Mana   Energy   Brains   Magic
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       Mag. User     2.0       75      20      6       2.75
       Fighter       3.0       40      30      3.0     1.5
       Elf           2.5       65      25      4.0     2.0
       Dwarf         5         30      35      2.5     1
       Halfling      2.0       30      30      4.5     1

       The character type also determines how much gold a player may carry, how long until  <u>rings</u>  can  overcome
       the player, and how much <u>poison</u> the player can withstand.

   <b>Spells</b>
       During  the  course of the game, the player may exercise his/her magic powers.  These cases are described
       below.

             <b>cloak</b>           <u>magic</u> <u>level</u> <u>necessary</u>: 20 (plus level 7)
                             <u>mana</u> <u>used</u>: 35 plus 3 per rest period
                             Used during normal play.  Prevents monsters from finding the character, as well  as
                             hiding  the  player  from other players.  His/her coordinates show up as '?' in the
                             <b>players</b> option.  Players cannot collect <u>mana</u>, find trading posts, or  discover  the
                             <u>grail</u>  while  cloaked.  Calling a monster uncloaks, as well as choosing this option
                             while cloaked.

             <b>teleport</b>        <u>magic</u> <u>level</u> <u>necessary</u>: 40 (plus level 12)
                             <u>mana</u> <u>used</u>: 30 per 75 moved
                             Used during normal play.  Allows the player to move with  much  more  freedom  than
                             with  the  <b>move</b>  option,  at  the  price  of  expending mana.  The maximum distance
                             possible to move is based upon <u>level</u> and <u>magic</u> <u>level</u>.

             <b>power</b> <b>blast</b>     <u>magic</u> <u>level</u> <u>necessary</u>: none
                             <u>mana</u> <u>used</u>: 5 times <u>level</u>
                             Used during inter-terminal battle.  Damage is based upon <u>magic</u> <u>level</u> and  <u>strength</u>.
                             Hits much harder than a normal hit.

             <b>all</b> <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b>  <u>magic</u> <u>level</u> <u>necessary</u>: none
                             <u>mana</u> <u>used</u>: 1
                             Used  while  combating monsters.  Has a 25% chance of working.  If it works it hits
                             the monster just enough to kill it.  If it fails, it doesn't hit the  monster,  and
                             doubles  the  monster's  <u>quickness</u>  and  <u>strength</u>.  Paralyzed monsters wake up much
                             quicker as a result of this spell.

             <b>magic</b> <b>bolt</b>      <u>magic</u> <u>level</u> <u>necessary</u>: 5
                             <u>mana</u> <u>used</u>: variable
                             Used while combating monsters.  Hits the monster based  upon  the  amount  of  <u>mana</u>
                             expended and <u>magic</u> <u>level</u>.  Guaranteed to hit at least 10 per <u>mana</u>.

             <b>force</b> <b>field</b>     <u>magic</u> <u>level</u> <u>necessary</u>: 15
                             <u>mana</u> <u>used</u>: 30
                             Used during monster combat.  Throws up a shield to protect from damage.  The shield
                             is  added to actual energy level, and is a fixed number, based upon maximum energy.
                             Normally, damage occurs first to the shield, and then to the players actual  <u>energy</u>
                             <u>level</u>.

             <b>transform</b>       <u>magic</u> <u>level</u> <u>necessary</u>: 25
                             <u>mana</u> <u>used</u>: 50
                             Used  during  monster  combat.  Transforms the monster randomly into one of the 100
                             monsters from the monster file.

             <b>increase</b> <b>might</b>  <u>magic</u> <u>level</u> <u>necessary</u>: 35
                             <u>mana</u> <u>used</u>: 75
                             Used during combat with monsters.  Increases strength up to a maximum.

             <b>invisibility</b>    <u>magic</u> <u>level</u> <u>necessary</u>: 45
                             <u>mana</u> <u>used</u>: 90
                             Used while fighting  monsters.   Makes  it  harder  for  the  monster  to  hit,  by
                             temporarily  increasing  the  player's <u>quickness</u>.  This spell may be thrown several
                             times, but a maximum level will be reached.

             <b>transport</b>       <u>magic</u> <u>level</u> <u>necessary</u>: 60
                             <u>mana</u> <u>used</u>: 125
                             Used during monster combat.  Transports the monster away from the player.   Success
                             is based upon player's <u>magic</u> and <u>brains</u>, and the monster's <u>experience</u>.  If it fails
                             the  player  is  transported  instead.   60% of the time, the monster will drop any
                             treasure it was carrying.

             <b>paralyze</b>        <u>magic</u> <u>level</u> <u>necessary</u>: 75
                             <u>mana</u> <u>used</u>: 150
                             Used during monster  combat.   “Freezes”  the  monster  by  putting  its  <u>quickness</u>
                             slightly  negative.   The  monster  will  slowly  wake  up.   Success is based upon
                             player's <u>magic</u> and the monster's <u>experience</u>.  If it fails, nothing happens.

             <b>specify</b>         <u>magic</u> <u>level</u> <u>necessary</u>: none
                             <u>mana</u> <u>used</u>: 1000
                             Used during monster combat only by <u>valar</u> or <u>council</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>wise</u>.  Allows the player
                             to pick which monster to fight.

   <b>Monsters</b>
       Monsters get bigger as one moves farther from the origin (0,0).  Rings of distance 125  from  the  origin
       determine  the  size.   A  monster's  <u>experience</u>,  <u>energy</u>  <u>level</u>,  and <u>brains</u> are multiplied by the size.
       <u>Strength</u> is increased 50% per size over one, and <u>quickness</u> remains the same, regardless of size.

       Also, nastier monsters are found as one progress farther out from the origin.  Monsters also  may  flock.
       The  percent  chance  of that happening is designated as <u>flock%</u> in the monster listing.  Monsters outside
       the first ring may carry treasure, as determined by their treasure type.  Flocking monsters,  and  bigger
       monsters increase the chances of treasure.

       Certain monsters have special abilities; they are as follows:

       <u>Unicorn</u>           can only be subdued if the player is in possession of a <u>virgin</u>.

       <u>Modnar</u>            has random characteristics, including treasure type.

       <u>Mimic</u>             will pick another name from the list of monsters in order to confuse.

       <u>Dark</u> <u>Lord</u>         very nasty person.  Does not like to be hit (especially nicked), and many spells do not
                         work well (or at all) against him.  One can always <u>evade</u> from the <u>Dark</u> <u>Lord</u>.

       <u>Leanan-Sidhe</u>      also a very nasty person.  She will permanently sap <u>strength</u> from someone.

       <u>Saruman</u>           wanders  around  with  <u>Wormtongue</u>,  who can steal a <u>palantir</u>.  Also, <u>Saruman</u> may turn a
                         player's gems into gold pieces, or scramble her/his stats.

       <u>Thaumaturgist</u>     can transport a player.

       <u>Balrog</u>            inflicts damage by taking away <u>experience</u>, not <u>energy</u>.

       <u>Vortex</u>            may take some <u>mana</u>.

       <u>Nazgul</u>            may try to steal a <u>ring</u> or neutralize part of one's <u>brains</u>.

       <u>Tiamat</u>            may take half a player's <u>gold</u> and <u>gems</u> and escape.

       <u>Kobold</u>            may get nasty and steal one gold piece and run away.

       <u>Shelob</u>            may bite, inflicting the equivalent of one <u>poison</u>.

       <u>Assorted</u> <u>Faeries</u>  These are killed if attacking someone carrying <u>holy</u> <u>water</u>.  These  are  <u>Cluricaun</u>,  <u>Fir</u>
                         <u>Darrig</u>, <u>Fachan</u>, <u>Ghille</u> <u>Dhu</u>, <u>Bogle</u>, <u>Killmoulis</u>, and <u>Bwca</u>.

       <u>Lamprey</u>           may bite, inflicting 1/2 of a <u>poison</u>.

       <u>Shrieker</u>          will call one of its (much bigger) buddies if picked upon.

       <u>Bonnacon</u>          will become bored with battle, fart, and run off.

       <u>Smeagol</u>           will try to steal a <u>ring</u> from a player, if given the chance.

       <u>Succubus</u>          may  inflict damage through a <b>force</b> <b>field</b>.  This subtracts from <u>energy</u> <u>level</u> instead of
                         any shield the player may have thrown up.  This is a very easy way to die.

       <u>Cerberus</u>          loves metal and will steal all the metal treasures from a player if able.

       <u>Ungoliant</u>         can bite and poison.  This inflicts five <u>poisons</u>, and also takes one from the  player's
                         <u>quickness</u>.

       <u>Jabberwock</u>        may  tire  of  battle,  and  leave  after  calling  one  of his friends (<u>Jubjub</u> <u>Bird</u> or
                         <u>Bandersnatch</u>).

       <u>Morgoth</u>           actually <u>Modnar</u>, but reserved for <u>council</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>wise</u>,  <u>valar</u>,  and  <u>ex-valar</u>.   Fights
                         with <u>Morgoth</u> end when either he or the player dies.  His characteristics are calculated
                         based  upon  the player's.  The player is given the chance to ally with him.  No magic,
                         except <b>force</b> <b>field</b> works when battling <u>Morgoth</u>.

       <u>Troll</u>             may regenerate its <u>energy</u> and <u>strength</u> while in battle.

       <u>Wraith</u>            may make a player blind.

   <b>Treasures</b>
       The various treasure types are as follows:

       Type zero             none

       Type one              <u>power</u> <u>booster</u> - adds mana.
                             <u>druid</u> - adds experience.
                             <u>holy</u> <u>orb</u> - subtracts 0.25 sin.

       Type two              <u>amulet</u> - protects from cursed treasure.
                             <u>holy</u> <u>water</u> - kills <u>assorted</u> <u>faeries</u>.
                             <u>hermit</u> - reduces sin by 25% and adds some mana.

       Type three            <u>shield</u> - adds to maximum <u>energy</u> <u>level</u>.
                             <u>virgin</u> - used to subdue a <u>unicorn</u>, or to give much <u>experience</u> (and some <u>sin</u>).
                             <u>athelas</u> - subtracts one <u>poison</u>.

       Type four (scrolls)   <u>shield</u> - throws a bigger than normal <b>force</b> <b>field</b>.
                             <u>invisible</u> - temporarily puts the finder's <u>quickness</u> to one million.
                             <u>ten</u> <u>fold</u> <u>strength</u> - multiplies finder's strength by ten.
                             <u>pick</u> <u>monster</u> - allows finder to pick next monster to battle.
                             <u>general</u> <u>knowledge</u> - adds to finder's <u>brains</u> and <u>magic</u> <u>level</u>.

                             All the scrolls except <u>general</u>  <u>knowledge</u>  automatically  call  a  monster.   These
                             preserve  any  spells  that were already in effect, but are only in effect while in
                             battle.

       Type five             <u>dagger</u> - adds to <u>strength</u>.
                             <u>armour</u> - same as a <u>shield</u>, but bigger.
                             <u>tablet</u> - adds <u>brains</u>.

       Type six              <u>priest</u> - rests to maximum; adds <u>mana</u>, <u>brains</u>; and halves <u>sin</u>.
                             <u>Robin</u> <u>Hood</u> - increases <u>shield</u> and adds permanently to <u>strength</u>.
                             <u>axe</u> - like <u>dagger</u>, but bigger.

       Type seven            <u>charm</u> - protects from cursed treasure (used before  <u>amulet</u>);  used  in  conjunction
                             with <u>blessing</u> to battle <u>Dark</u> <u>Lord</u>.
                             <u>Merlyn</u> - adds <u>brains</u>, <u>magic</u>, and <u>mana</u>.
                             <u>war</u> <u>hammer</u> - like an <u>axe</u>, but bigger.

       Type eight            <u>healing</u>  <u>potion</u>  -  sets  <u>poison</u>  to -2, or subtracts two from <u>poison</u>, whichever is
                             better.
                             <u>transporter</u> - allows finder to move anywhere.
                             <u>sword</u> - like a <u>war</u> <u>hammer</u>, but bigger.

       Type nine             <u>golden</u> <u>crown</u> - allows the player to become <u>king</u>, by going to (0,0).
                             <u>blessing</u> - cuts <u>sin</u> to 1/3, adds <u>mana</u>, rests to maximum, kills  <u>Dark</u>  <u>Lord</u>  with  a
                             <u>charm</u>, and gives bearer first hit on all monsters.
                             <u>quicksilver</u> - adds to <u>quickness</u>.

       Type ten              <u>elven</u> <u>boots</u> - adds permanently to <u>quickness</u>.

       Type eleven           <u>palantir</u>  - allows one to see all the other players; used by <u>council</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>wise</u> to
                             seek the <u>grail</u>.

       Type twelve/thirteen  <u>ring</u> - allows one to hit much harder in battle, etc.

       Any treasure type 10-13 monsters may instead carry a type nine treasure.

       A monster may also be carrying <u>gold</u> or <u>gems</u>.  These are used at <u>trading</u> <u>posts</u> to buy things.   A  <u>gem</u>  is
       worth 1000 gold pieces.  Too much <u>gold</u> will slow a player down.  One may carry 1000 plus 200 per <u>level</u> of
       <u>gold</u>.  A <u>gem</u> weighs one half a gold piece.  Monsters of treasure type 7 or higher may carry <u>gems</u>.

       The  chance of a cursed treasure is based upon treasure type.  The more valuable treasures have a greater
       chance of being cursed.  A cursed treasure knocks <u>energy</u> <u>level</u> very low, and adds 0.25 <u>poison</u>.

   <b>Rings</b>
       <u>Rings</u> are only carried by <u>nazguls</u> and <u>Dark</u> <u>Lords</u>.  They come in four different flavors.  All  <u>rings</u>  rest
       the  player  to  maximum  and  cause him/her to hit much harder in battle with monsters (assuming one has
       chosen to use the <u>ring</u> for battle.)

       Two types of <u>rings</u> are cursed and come either from <u>nazguls</u> or <u>Dark</u> <u>Lord</u>.  After  a  few  times  of  using
       these  types,  the  player  falls  under  the control of the <u>ring</u>, and strange, random things will occur.
       Eventually, the player dies, and gives his/her name to a monster on the file.  Dying before the  <u>ring</u>  is
       used up also renames the monster.

       The  two  remaining  types  of  <u>rings</u>  are much more benign.  The one from a <u>nazgul</u> is good for a limited
       number of battle rounds, and will save the player from death if it was being used when he/she died.   The
       one  from  <u>Dark</u>  <u>Lord</u> is the same, except that it never is used up.  <u>rings</u> disappear after saving someone
       from death.  In general, cursed <u>rings</u> occur much more often than normal ones.  It is usually not  a  good
       idea to pick one up.  The only way to get rid of a <u>ring</u> is to have a monster steal it.

   <b>King</b>
       A  player  may become <u>king</u> by finding a <u>crown</u> and going to (0,0).  Players must have a <u>level</u> in the range
       of 10 to 1000 to be able to find a <u>crown</u>.  When a player with one or more <u>crowns</u> reaches <u>level</u> 1000,  the
       <u>crowns</u> are converted to <u>gold</u>.

       Once  a  player  is  king,  he/she  may  do  certain things while in the Lord's Chamber (0,0).  These are
       exercised with the <b>decree</b> ('0') option.

       <b>transport</b>      This is done to another player.  It randomly moves the affected  player  about.   A  <u>charm</u>
                      protects from transports.

       <b>curse</b>          This  is  done  to  another  player.   It  is analogous to cursed treasure, but worse.  It
                      inflicts two <u>poison</u>, knocks <u>energy</u> <u>level</u> very low, and degrades the  maximum  energy.   It
                      also removes a <u>cloak</u>.  A <u>blessing</u> protects from king's curses.

       <b>energy</b> <b>void</b>    The  king may put a number of these scattered about his/her kingdom as he/she pleases.  If
                      a player hits one, he/she loses <u>mana</u>, <u>energy</u>, and <u>gold</u>.  The energy void disappears  after
                      being hit.

       <b>bestow</b>         This  is  also  done  to  another  player.   The king may wish to reward one or more loyal
                      subjects by sharing his/her riches (<u>gold</u>).  Or it is a convenient way to dispose  of  some
                      unwanted deadweight.

       <b>collect</b> <b>taxes</b>  Everyone pays 7% tax on all <u>gold</u> and <u>gems</u> acquired, regardless of the existence of a <u>king</u>.
                      The king collects the accrued taxes with this option.

       The <u>king</u> may also <b>teleport</b> anywhere for free by using the origin as a starting place.

   <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wise,</b> <b>Valar</b>
       A  player automatically becomes a member of the <u>council</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>wise</u> upon reaching level 3000.  Members of
       the council cannot have <u>rings</u>.  Members of the council have a few extra options which they can  exercise.
       These  are  exercised  with  the  <b>intervene</b>  ('8')  option.   All  <b>intervene</b> options cost 1000 mana.  One
       <b>intervene</b> option is to <b>heal</b> another player.  This is just a quick way for that player  to  be  rested  to
       maximum  and  lose  a  little <u>poison</u>.  The main purpose in life for members of the council is to seek the
       <u>Holy</u> <u>Grail</u>.  This is done with a <u>palantir</u> under the <b>seek</b> <b>grail</b> option.  The distance cited by the seek is
       accurate within 10%, in order not  to  make  it  too  easy  to  find  the  grail.   A  player  must  have
       infinitesimally small <u>sin</u>, or else it's all over upon finding the grail.  In order to help members of the
       council on their quest, they may <b>teleport</b> with greater ease.

       Upon  finding  the  grail,  the  player advances to position of <u>valar</u>.  He/she may then exercise more and
       niftier options under <b>intervention</b>.  These include all of the council members' options plus  the  ability
       to  move  other  players  about, bless them, and throw monsters at them.  A <u>valar</u>'s blessing has the same
       effect as the treasure <u>blessing</u>, except that the affected player does not get his/her <u>blessing</u> flag  set.
       All <b>intervention</b> options which affect other players age the player who uses them.  <u>Valars</u> are essentially
       immortal,  but  are  actually  given  five  lives.   If these are used up, the player is left to die, and
       becomes an <u>ex-valar</u>.  A <u>valar</u> cannot <b>move</b>, <b>teleport</b>, or call monsters.  (An exception to this is  if  the
       <u>valar</u>  finds  a  <u>transporter</u>.)  This is to allow him/her to dispose of excess <u>gold</u>.  Any monsters which a
       <u>valar</u> encounters are based upon his/her size.  Only one valar may exist at a time.  The current valar  is
       replaced when another player finds the grail.  The valar is then bumped back to the council of the wise.

   <b>Wizard</b>
       The  <u>wizard</u> is usually the owner of the game, and the one who maintains the associated files.  The <u>wizard</u>
       is granted special powers within the game, if it is invoked with the <b>-S</b> option.   Otherwise,  the  <u>wizard</u>
       plays no different from other players.  The <u>wizard</u> abilities are outlined below.

       <b>change</b> <b>players</b>        When  examining  a player, (game invoked with <b>-x</b>, or use 'X' from within game), the
                             <u>wizard</u> may also change the player.

       <b>intervention</b>          The <u>wizard</u> may do all the <b>intervention</b> options.  One  extra  option,  <b>vaporize</b>,  is
                             added to kill any offensive players.

       <b>super</b> <b>character</b> <b>type</b>  An  extra character type is added.  This character starts with the maximum possible
                             in all statistics, selected from the other character types.   A  <u>super</u>  character's
                             statistics  also  progress  at  the  maximum possible rate, selected from the other
                             character types.

   <b>Special</b> <b>Places</b>
       Certain regions of the playing grid have different names.  In general, this is only to  give  the  player
       some idea of his/her present location.  Some special places do exist.

       <u>Trading</u> <u>Posts</u>  These are located at |x| == |y| == n*n*100 for n = 1, 2, ..., 1000.  Trading posts farther
                      out  have  more  things  for sale.  Be careful about cheating the merchants there, as they
                      have short tempers.  Merchants are dishonest about 5% of the time.

       <u>Lord's</u> <u>Chamber</u>
                      This is located at (0,0).  Only players with <u>crowns</u> may enter.

       <u>Point</u> <u>of</u> <u>No</u> <u>Return</u>
                      This is located beyond 1.2e+6 in any direction.  The only way to return  from  here  is  a
                      <u>transporter</u> or to have a <u>valar</u> relocate the player.

       <u>Dead</u> <u>Marshes</u>   This is a band located fairly distant from the origin.  The first fourteen monsters (water
                      monsters) can normally only be found here.

       <u>Valhala</u>        This  place is where the <u>valar</u> resides.  It is associated with no particular coordinate on
                      the playing grid.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       Once a player reaches <u>level</u> 5, the game will start to time out waiting for input.  This is to try to keep
       the game a bit faster paced.

       A <u>guru</u> will never be disgusted with your <u>sins</u> if they are less than one.

       A <u>medic</u> wants half of a player's <u>gold</u> to be happy.  Offering more than one has, or a negative amount will
       anger the <u>medic</u>, who will make the player worse (add one <u>poison</u>).

       The <u>Holy</u> <u>Grail</u> does little for those who are not ready to behold it.  Whenever anyone finds it, it moves.
       It is always located within 1e+6 in any compass direction of the origin.

       There is a maximum amount of <u>mana</u> and <u>charms</u> a player may  posses,  based  upon  <u>level</u>.   <u>Quicksilver</u>  is
       always limited to to a maximum of 99.

       <u>Books</u>  bought  at a <u>trading</u> <u>post</u> increase <u>brains</u>, based upon the number bought.  It is unwise, however to
       buy more than 1/10 of one's <u>level</u> in books at a time.

       Players over level 10000 are automatically retired.

       A <u>blindness</u> goes away in random time.

       Players with <u>crowns</u> are identified with a '*' before their character type.

   <b>Inter-terminal</b> <b>Battle</b>
       When two player's coordinates correspond, they may engage in battle.  In general,  the  player  with  the
       highest <u>quickness</u> gets the first hit.  If the two players are severely mismatched, the stronger player is
       drastically  handicapped  for  the battle.  In order to protect from being stuck in an infinite loop, the
       player waiting for response may time out.  Options for battle are:

       <b>fight</b>        Inflicts damage upon other person.

       <b>run</b> <b>away</b>     Escape from battle.  Has a 75% chance of working.

       <b>power</b> <b>blast</b>  Battle spell.

       <b>luckout</b>      One-time chance to try to win against the foe.  Has a 10% chance of working.

       Sometimes waits for the other player may be excessive, because he/she may be battling  a  monster.   Upon
       slaying  a  player in battle the winner gets the other's <u>experience</u> and treasures.  <u>Rings</u> do not work for
       inter-terminal battle.
