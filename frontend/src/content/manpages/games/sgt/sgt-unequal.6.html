       <b>sgt-unequal</b> - Latin square puzzle

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sgt-unequal</b> [<b>--generate</b> <u>n</u>] [<b>--print</b> <u>w</u><b>x</b><u>h</u> [<b>--with-solutions</b>] [<b>--scale</b> <u>n</u>] [<b>--colour</b>]] [<u>game-parameters</u>|<u>game-</u>

       <b>sgt-unequal</b> <b>--version</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You  have a square grid; each square may contain a digit from 1 to the size of the grid, and some squares
       have clue signs between them. Your aim is to fully populate the grid with numbers such that:

       <b>•</b>      Each row contains only one occurrence of each digit

       <b>•</b>      Each column contains only one occurrence of each digit

       <b>•</b>      All the clue signs are satisfied.

       There are two modes for this game, ‘Unequal’ and ‘Adjacent’.

       In ‘Unequal’ mode, the clue signs are greater-than symbols indicating one square's value is greater  than
       its neighbour's. In this mode not all clues may be visible, particularly at higher difficulty levels.

       In  ‘Adjacent’  mode, the clue signs are bars indicating one square's value is numerically adjacent (i.e.
       one higher or one lower) than its neighbour. In this mode all clues are always visible: absence of a  bar
       thus means that a square's value is definitely not numerically adjacent to that neighbour's.

       In  ‘Trivial’ difficulty level (available via the ‘Custom’ game type selector), there are no greater-than
       signs in ‘Unequal’ mode; the puzzle is to solve the Latin square only.

       At the time of writing, the ‘Unequal’ mode of this puzzle is appearing in the Guardian weekly  under  the
       name ‘Futoshiki’.

       Unequal was contributed to this collection by James Harvey.

</pre><h4><b>Unequal</b> <b>controls</b></h4><pre>
       Unequal shares much of its control system with Solo.

       To  play  Unequal,  simply  click  the  mouse  in any empty square and then type a digit or letter on the
       keyboard to fill that square. If you make a mistake, click the mouse in the incorrect  square  and  press
       Space to clear it again (or use the Undo feature).

       If  you  <u>right</u>-click  in  a square and then type a number, that number will be entered in the square as a
       ‘pencil mark’. You can have pencil marks for multiple numbers in  the  same  square.  Squares  containing
       filled-in numbers cannot also contain pencil marks.

       The  game  pays  no attention to pencil marks, so exactly what you use them for is up to you: you can use
       them as reminders that a particular square needs to be re-examined once you know more about a  particular
       number, or you can use them as lists of the possible numbers in a given square, or anything else you feel
       like.

       To erase a single pencil mark, right-click in the square and type the same number again.

       All pencil marks in a square are erased when you left-click and type a number, or when you left-click and
       press space. Right-clicking and pressing space will also erase pencil marks.

       As  for  Solo,  the  cursor  keys can be used in conjunction with the digit keys to set numbers or pencil
       marks. You can also use the ‘M’ key to auto-fill every numeric hint, ready for removal  as  required,  or
       the ‘H’ key to do the same but also to remove all obvious hints.

       Alternatively,  use the cursor keys to move the mark around the grid. Pressing the return key toggles the
       mark (from a normal mark to a pencil mark), and typing a number in  is  entered  in  the  square  in  the
       appropriate way; typing in a 0 or using the space bar will clear a filled square.

       Left-clicking  a  clue  will mark it as done (grey it out), or unmark it if it is already marked. Holding
       Control or Shift and pressing an arrow key likewise marks any clue adjacent to the cursor  in  the  given
       direction.

       (All the actions described below are also available.)

</pre><h4><b>Unequal</b> <b>parameters</b></h4><pre>
       These parameters are available from the ‘Custom...’ option on the ‘Type’ menu.

       <u>Mode</u>   Mode of the puzzle (‘Unequal’ or ‘Adjacent’)

       <u>Size</u> <u>(s*s)</u>
              Size of grid.

       <u>Difficulty</u>
              Controls  the  difficulty  of  the  generated  puzzle. At Trivial level, there are no greater-than
              signs; the puzzle is to solve the Latin square only. At Recursive level (only  available  via  the
              ‘Custom’  game  type  selector)  backtracking  will  be required, but the solution should still be
              unique. The levels in between require increasingly complex reasoning to avoid having to backtrack.

</pre><h4><b>Common</b> <b>actions</b></h4><pre>
       These actions are all available from the ‘Game’ menu and via keyboard shortcuts, in addition to any game-
       specific actions.

       (On Mac OS X, to conform with local user interface standards, these actions are situated  on  the  ‘File’
       and ‘Edit’ menus instead.)

       <u>New</u> <u>game</u> (‘N’, Ctrl+‘N’)
              Starts a new game, with a random initial state.

       <u>Restart</u> <u>game</u>
              Resets the current game to its initial state. (This can be undone.)

       <u>Load</u>   Loads a saved game from a file on disk.

       <u>Save</u>   Saves the current state of your game to a file on disk.

              The Load and Save operations preserve your entire game history (so you can save, reload, and still
              Undo and Redo things you had done before saving).

       <u>Print</u>  Where supported (currently only on Windows), brings up a dialog allowing you to print an arbitrary
              number of puzzles randomly generated from the current parameters, optionally including the current
              puzzle.  (Only for puzzles which make sense to print, of course – it's hard to think of a sensible
              printable representation of Fifteen!)

       <u>Undo</u> (‘U’, Ctrl+‘Z’, Ctrl+‘_’, ‘*’)
              Undoes a single move. (You can undo moves back to the start of the session.)

       <u>Redo</u> (‘R’, Ctrl+‘R’, ‘#’)
              Redoes a previously undone move.

       <u>Copy</u>   Copies the current state of your game to the clipboard in text format, so that you  can  paste  it
              into  (say)  an  e-mail  client  or a web message board if you're discussing the game with someone
              else. (Not all games support this feature.)

       <u>Solve</u>  Transforms the puzzle instantly into its solved state. For some games (Cube) this feature  is  not
              supported at all because it is of no particular use. For other games (such as Pattern), the solved
              state can be used to give you information, if you can't see how a solution can exist at all or you
              want to know where you made a mistake. For still other games (such as Sixteen), automatic solution
              tells  you nothing about how to <u>get</u> to the solution, but it does provide a useful way to get there
              quickly so that you can experiment with set-piece moves and transformations.

              Some games (such as Solo) are capable of solving a game ID you have typed in from elsewhere. Other
              games (such as Rectangles) cannot solve a game ID they didn't invent themself, but when  they  did
              invent  the  game ID they know what the solution is already. Still other games (Pattern) can solve
              <u>some</u> external game IDs, but only if they aren't too difficult.

              The ‘Solve’ command adds the solved state to the end of the undo chain for the  puzzle.  In  other
              words,  if  you want to go back to solving it yourself after seeing the answer, you can just press
              Undo.

       <u>Quit</u> (‘Q’, Ctrl+‘Q’)
              Closes the application entirely.

</pre><h4><b>Specifying</b> <b>games</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>ID</b></h4><pre>
       There are two ways to save a game specification out of a puzzle and recreate it later, or recreate it  in
       somebody else's copy of the same puzzle.

       The ‘Specific’ and ‘Random Seed’ options from the ‘Game’ menu (or the ‘File’ menu, on Mac OS X) each show
       a piece of text (a ‘game ID’) which is sufficient to reconstruct precisely the same game at a later date.

       You  can  enter  either of these pieces of text back into the program (via the same ‘Specific’ or ‘Random
       Seed’ menu options) at a later point, and it will recreate the same game. You can also use either one  as
       a command line argument (on Windows or Unix); see below for more detail.

       The  difference  between  the  two  forms  is  that a descriptive game ID is a literal <u>description</u> of the
       initial state of the game, whereas a random seed is just a piece of arbitrary text which was provided  as
       input to the random number generator used to create the puzzle. This means that:

       <b>•</b>      Descriptive game IDs tend to be longer in many puzzles (although some, such as Cube (<u><a href="../man6/sgt-cube.6.html">sgt-cube</a></u>(6)),
              only  need  very  short  descriptions).  So  a random seed is often a <u>quicker</u> way to note down the
              puzzle you're currently playing, or to tell it to somebody else so they can play the same  one  as
              you.

       <b>•</b>      Any  text  at  all  is  a  valid  random  seed. The automatically generated ones are fifteen-digit
              numbers, but anything will do; you can type in your full name, or a word you just made up,  and  a
              valid  puzzle  will  be  generated  from it. This provides a way for two or more people to race to
              complete the same puzzle: you think of a random seed, then everybody types it in at the same time,
              and nobody has an advantage due to having seen the generated puzzle before anybody else.

       <b>•</b>      It is often possible to convert puzzles from other sources (such as ‘nonograms’ or  ‘sudoku’  from
              newspapers) into descriptive game IDs suitable for use with these programs.

       <b>•</b>      Random  seeds  are  not  guaranteed  to  produce  the same result if you use them with a different
              <u>version</u> of the puzzle program. This is because the generation algorithm might have  been  improved
              or  modified  in  later  versions  of the code, and will therefore produce a different result when
              given the same sequence of random numbers. Use a descriptive game ID if you aren't  sure  that  it
              will be used on the same version of the program as yours.

              (Use the ‘About’ menu option to find out the version number of the program. Programs with the same
              version number running on different platforms should still be random-seed compatible.)

       A  descriptive game ID starts with a piece of text which encodes the <u>parameters</u> of the current game (such
       as grid size). Then there is a colon, and after that is the description of the game's  initial  state.  A
       random  seed  starts  with  a  similar string of parameters, but then it contains a hash sign followed by
       arbitrary data.

       If you enter a descriptive game ID, the program will not be able  to  show  you  the  random  seed  which
       generated  it,  since  it  wasn't  generated <u>from</u> a random seed. If you <u>enter</u> a random seed, however, the
       program will be able to show you the descriptive game ID derived from that random seed.

       Note that the game parameter strings are not always identical between the  two  forms.  For  some  games,
       there  will be parameter data provided with the random seed which is not included in the descriptive game
       ID. This is because that parameter information is only relevant when <u>generating</u> puzzle grids, and is  not
       important  when  playing  them.  Thus,  for  example,  the  difficulty level in Solo (<u><a href="../man6/sgt-solo.6.html">sgt-solo</a></u>(6)) is not
       mentioned in the descriptive game ID.

       These additional parameters are also not set permanently if you type in a game ID. For  example,  suppose
       you  have  Solo  set  to  ‘Advanced’ difficulty level, and then a friend wants your help with a ‘Trivial’
       puzzle; so the friend reads out a random seed specifying ‘Trivial’ difficulty, and you type  it  in.  The
       program will generate you the same ‘Trivial’ grid which your friend was having trouble with, but once you
       have  finished  playing  it,  when you ask for a new game it will automatically go back to the ‘Advanced’
       difficulty which it was previously set on.

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>‘Type’</b> <b>menu</b></h4><pre>
       The ‘Type’ menu, if present, may contain a list of preset game settings.  Selecting  one  of  these  will
       start a new random game with the parameters specified.

       The  ‘Type’  menu  may  also contain a ‘Custom’ option which allows you to fine-tune game parameters. The
       parameters available are specific to each game and are described in the following sections.

</pre><h4><b>Specifying</b> <b>game</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b></h4><pre>
       (This section does not apply to the Mac OS X version.)

       The games in this collection deliberately do not ever save information on to the computer  they  run  on:
       they  have  no high score tables and no saved preferences. (This is because I expect at least some people
       to play them at work, and those people will probably appreciate leaving as little evidence as possible!)

       However, if you do want to arrange for one of these games to default to a particular set  of  parameters,
       you can specify them on the command line.

       The  easiest  way  to do this is to set up the parameters you want using the ‘Type’ menu (see above), and
       then to select ‘Random Seed’ from the ‘Game’ or ‘File’ menu (see above). The text in the  ‘Game  ID’  box
       will  be  composed  of  two  parts,  separated  by  a  hash. The first of these parts represents the game
       parameters (the size of the playing area, for example, and anything else you set using the ‘Type’ menu).

       If you run the game with just that parameter text on the command line, it will start up with the settings
       you specified.

       For example: if you run Cube (see <u><a href="../man6/sgt-cube.6.html">sgt-cube</a></u>(6)), select ‘Octahedron’ from the ‘Type’ menu, and then go  to
       the  game  ID  selection,  you  will  see a string of the form ‘<b>o2x2#338686542711620</b>’. Take only the part
       before the hash (‘<b>o2x2</b>’), and start Cube with that text on the command line: ‘<b>sgt-cube</b> <b>o2x2</b>’.

       If you copy the <u>entire</u> game ID on to the command line, the game will start up in the specific  game  that
       was  described.  This is occasionally a more convenient way to start a particular game ID than by pasting
       it into the game ID selection box.

       (You could also retrieve the encoded game parameters using the ‘Specific’ menu option instead of  ‘Random
       Seed’,  but if you do then some options, such as the difficulty level in Solo, will be missing. See above
       for more details on this.)

</pre><h4><b>Unix</b> <b>command-line</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       (This section only applies to the Unix port.)

       In addition to being able to specify game parameters on the command line (see above), there  are  various
       other options:

       <b>--game</b>

       <b>--load</b> These  options  respectively  determine whether the command-line argument is treated as specifying
              game parameters or a save file to load. Only one should be specified. If neither of these  options
              is specified, a guess is made based on the format of the argument.

       <b>--generate</b> <u>n</u>
              If this option is specified, instead of a puzzle being displayed, a number of descriptive game IDs
              will  be  invented  and  printed on standard output. This is useful for gaining access to the game
              generation algorithms without necessarily using the frontend.

              If game parameters are specified on the command-line, they will be used to generate the game  IDs;
              otherwise a default set of parameters will be used.

              The  most common use of this option is in conjunction with <b>--print</b>, in which case its behaviour is
              slightly different; see below.

       <b>--print</b> <u>w</u><b>x</b><u>h</u>
              If this option is specified, instead of a puzzle being displayed, a printed representation of  one
              or more unsolved puzzles is sent to standard output, in PostScript format.

              On  each  page  of puzzles, there will be <u>w</u> across and <u>h</u> down. If there are more puzzles than <u>w</u>×<u>h</u>,
              more than one page will be printed.

              If <b>--generate</b> has also been specified, the invented game IDs will be used to generate the  printed
              output.  Otherwise,  a list of game IDs is expected on standard input (which can be descriptive or
              random seeds; see above), in the same format produced by <b>--generate</b>.

              For example:

              sgt-net --generate 12 --print 2x3 7x7w | lpr

              will generate two pages of printed Net puzzles (each of which will have a 7×7 wrapping grid),  and
              pipe the output to the <b>lpr</b> command, which on many systems will send them to an actual printer.

              There are various other options which affect printing; see below.

       <b>--save</b> <u>file-prefix</u> [ <b>--save-suffix</b> <u>file-suffix</u> ]
              If this option is specified, instead of a puzzle being displayed, saved-game files for one or more
              unsolved puzzles are written to files constructed from the supplied prefix and/or suffix.

              If  <b>--generate</b> has also been specified, the invented game IDs will be used to generate the printed
              output. Otherwise, a list of game IDs is expected on standard input (which can be  descriptive  or
              random seeds; see above), in the same format produced by <b>--generate</b>.

              For example:

              sgt-net --generate 12 --save game --save-suffix .sav

              will generate twelve Net saved-game files with the names <b>game0.sav</b> to <b>game11.sav</b>.

       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information about the game, and then quits.

       The following options are only meaningful if <b>--print</b> is also specified:

       <b>--with-solutions</b>
              The set of pages filled with unsolved puzzles will be followed by the solutions to those puzzles.

       <b>--scale</b> <u>n</u>
              Adjusts  how  big  each puzzle is when printed. Larger numbers make puzzles bigger; the default is
              1.0.

       <b>--colour</b>
              Puzzles will be printed in colour, rather than in black and white (if supported by the puzzle).
