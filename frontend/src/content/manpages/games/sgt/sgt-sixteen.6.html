       <b>sgt-sixteen</b> - Toroidal sliding block puzzle

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sgt-sixteen</b> [<b>--generate</b> <u>n</u>] [<b>--print</b> <u>w</u><b>x</b><u>h</u> [<b>--with-solutions</b>] [<b>--scale</b> <u>n</u>] [<b>--colour</b>]] [<u>game-parameters</u>|<u>game-</u>
       <u>ID</u>|<u>random-seed</u>]

       <b>sgt-sixteen</b> <b>--version</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Another  sliding  tile puzzle, visually similar to Fifteen (see <u><a href="../man6/sgt-fifteen.6.html">sgt-fifteen</a></u>(6)) but with a different type
       of move. This time, there is no hole: all 16 squares on the grid contain numbered squares. Your  move  is
       to  shift  an entire row left or right, or shift an entire column up or down; every time you do that, the
       tile you shift off the grid re-appears at the other end of the same row, in the space you  just  vacated.
       To  win, arrange the tiles into numerical order (1,2,3,4 on the top row, 13,14,15,16 on the bottom). When
       you've done that, try playing on different sizes of grid.

       I <u>might</u> have invented this game myself, though only by accident if so (and I'm  sure  other  people  have
       independently  invented  it). I thought I was imitating a screensaver I'd seen, but I have a feeling that
       the screensaver might actually have been a Fifteen-type puzzle rather than this slightly different  kind.
       So this might be the one thing in my puzzle collection which represents creativity on my part rather than
       just engineering.

</pre><h4><b>Sixteen</b> <b>controls</b></h4><pre>
       Left-clicking  on  an  arrow  will  move the appropriate row or column in the direction indicated. Right-
       clicking will move it in the opposite direction.

       Alternatively, use the cursor keys to move the position indicator around the edge of the  grid,  and  use
       the return key to move the row/column in the direction indicated.

       You can also move the tiles directly. Move the cursor onto a tile, hold Control and press an arrow key to
       move  the  tile under the cursor and move the cursor along with the tile. Or, hold Shift to move only the
       tile. Pressing Enter simulates holding down Control (press Enter again to release), while pressing  Space
       simulates holding down shift.

       (All the actions described below are also available.)

</pre><h4><b>Sixteen</b> <b>parameters</b></h4><pre>
       The parameters available from the ‘Custom...’ option on the ‘Type’ menu are:

       <b>•</b>      <u>Width</u> and <u>Height</u>, which are self-explanatory.

       <b>•</b>      You  can  ask  for  a limited shuffling operation to be performed on the grid. By default, Sixteen
              will shuffle the grid in such a way that any arrangement is about as probable as  any  other.  You
              can  override  this  by  requesting a precise number of shuffling moves to be performed. Typically
              your aim is then to determine the precise set of shuffling moves and invert them exactly, so  that
              you  answer  (say) a four-move shuffle with a four-move solution. Note that the more moves you ask
              for, the more likely it is that solutions shorter than the target  length  will  turn  out  to  be
              possible.

</pre><h4><b>Common</b> <b>actions</b></h4><pre>
       These actions are all available from the ‘Game’ menu and via keyboard shortcuts, in addition to any game-
       specific actions.

       (On  Mac  OS  X, to conform with local user interface standards, these actions are situated on the ‘File’
       and ‘Edit’ menus instead.)

       <u>New</u> <u>game</u> (‘N’, Ctrl+‘N’)
              Starts a new game, with a random initial state.

       <u>Restart</u> <u>game</u>
              Resets the current game to its initial state. (This can be undone.)

       <u>Load</u>   Loads a saved game from a file on disk.

       <u>Save</u>   Saves the current state of your game to a file on disk.

              The Load and Save operations preserve your entire game history (so you can save, reload, and still
              Undo and Redo things you had done before saving).

       <u>Print</u>  Where supported (currently only on Windows), brings up a dialog allowing you to print an arbitrary
              number of puzzles randomly generated from the current parameters, optionally including the current
              puzzle. (Only for puzzles which make sense to print, of course – it's hard to think of a  sensible
              printable representation of Fifteen!)

       <u>Undo</u> (‘U’, Ctrl+‘Z’, Ctrl+‘_’, ‘*’)
              Undoes a single move. (You can undo moves back to the start of the session.)

       <u>Redo</u> (‘R’, Ctrl+‘R’, ‘#’)
              Redoes a previously undone move.

       <u>Copy</u>   Copies  the  current  state of your game to the clipboard in text format, so that you can paste it
              into (say) an e-mail client or a web message board if you're  discussing  the  game  with  someone
              else. (Not all games support this feature.)

       <u>Solve</u>  Transforms  the  puzzle instantly into its solved state. For some games (Cube) this feature is not
              supported at all because it is of no particular use. For other games (such as Pattern), the solved
              state can be used to give you information, if you can't see how a solution can exist at all or you
              want to know where you made a mistake. For still other games (such as Sixteen), automatic solution
              tells you nothing about how to <u>get</u> to the solution, but it does provide a useful way to get  there
              quickly so that you can experiment with set-piece moves and transformations.

              Some games (such as Solo) are capable of solving a game ID you have typed in from elsewhere. Other
              games  (such  as Rectangles) cannot solve a game ID they didn't invent themself, but when they did
              invent the game ID they know what the solution is already. Still other games (Pattern)  can  solve
              <u>some</u> external game IDs, but only if they aren't too difficult.

              The  ‘Solve’  command  adds the solved state to the end of the undo chain for the puzzle. In other
              words, if you want to go back to solving it yourself after seeing the answer, you can  just  press
              Undo.

       <u>Quit</u> (‘Q’, Ctrl+‘Q’)
              Closes the application entirely.

</pre><h4><b>Specifying</b> <b>games</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>ID</b></h4><pre>
       There  are two ways to save a game specification out of a puzzle and recreate it later, or recreate it in
       somebody else's copy of the same puzzle.

       The ‘Specific’ and ‘Random Seed’ options from the ‘Game’ menu (or the ‘File’ menu, on Mac OS X) each show
       a piece of text (a ‘game ID’) which is sufficient to reconstruct precisely the same game at a later date.

       You can enter either of these pieces of text back into the program (via the same  ‘Specific’  or  ‘Random
       Seed’  menu options) at a later point, and it will recreate the same game. You can also use either one as
       a command line argument (on Windows or Unix); see below for more detail.

       The difference between the two forms is that a descriptive game  ID  is  a  literal  <u>description</u>  of  the
       initial  state of the game, whereas a random seed is just a piece of arbitrary text which was provided as
       input to the random number generator used to create the puzzle. This means that:

       <b>•</b>      Descriptive game IDs tend to be longer in many puzzles (although some, such as Cube (<u><a href="../man6/sgt-cube.6.html">sgt-cube</a></u>(6)),
              only need very short descriptions). So a random seed is often a  <u>quicker</u>  way  to  note  down  the
              puzzle  you're  currently playing, or to tell it to somebody else so they can play the same one as
              you.

       <b>•</b>      Any text at all is a valid  random  seed.  The  automatically  generated  ones  are  fifteen-digit
              numbers,  but  anything will do; you can type in your full name, or a word you just made up, and a
              valid puzzle will be generated from it. This provides a way for two or  more  people  to  race  to
              complete the same puzzle: you think of a random seed, then everybody types it in at the same time,
              and nobody has an advantage due to having seen the generated puzzle before anybody else.

       <b>•</b>      It  is  often possible to convert puzzles from other sources (such as ‘nonograms’ or ‘sudoku’ from
              newspapers) into descriptive game IDs suitable for use with these programs.

       <b>•</b>      Random seeds are not guaranteed to produce the same result  if  you  use  them  with  a  different
              <u>version</u>  of  the puzzle program. This is because the generation algorithm might have been improved
              or modified in later versions of the code, and will therefore  produce  a  different  result  when
              given  the  same  sequence of random numbers. Use a descriptive game ID if you aren't sure that it
              will be used on the same version of the program as yours.

              (Use the ‘About’ menu option to find out the version number of the program. Programs with the same
              version number running on different platforms should still be random-seed compatible.)

       A descriptive game ID starts with a piece of text which encodes the <u>parameters</u> of the current game  (such
       as  grid  size).  Then there is a colon, and after that is the description of the game's initial state. A
       random seed starts with a similar string of parameters, but then it contains  a  hash  sign  followed  by
       arbitrary data.

       If  you  enter  a  descriptive  game  ID,  the program will not be able to show you the random seed which
       generated it, since it wasn't generated <u>from</u> a random seed. If you <u>enter</u>  a  random  seed,  however,  the
       program will be able to show you the descriptive game ID derived from that random seed.

       Note  that  the  game  parameter  strings are not always identical between the two forms. For some games,
       there will be parameter data provided with the random seed which is not included in the descriptive  game
       ID.  This is because that parameter information is only relevant when <u>generating</u> puzzle grids, and is not
       important when playing them. Thus, for example,  the  difficulty  level  in  Solo  (<u><a href="../man6/sgt-solo.6.html">sgt-solo</a></u>(6))  is  not
       mentioned in the descriptive game ID.

       These  additional  parameters are also not set permanently if you type in a game ID. For example, suppose
       you have Solo set to ‘Advanced’ difficulty level, and then a friend wants  your  help  with  a  ‘Trivial’
       puzzle;  so  the  friend reads out a random seed specifying ‘Trivial’ difficulty, and you type it in. The
       program will generate you the same ‘Trivial’ grid which your friend was having trouble with, but once you
       have finished playing it, when you ask for a new game it will automatically go  back  to  the  ‘Advanced’
       difficulty which it was previously set on.

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>‘Type’</b> <b>menu</b></h4><pre>
       The  ‘Type’  menu,  if  present,  may contain a list of preset game settings. Selecting one of these will
       start a new random game with the parameters specified.

       The ‘Type’ menu may also contain a ‘Custom’ option which allows you to  fine-tune  game  parameters.  The
       parameters available are specific to each game and are described in the following sections.

</pre><h4><b>Specifying</b> <b>game</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b></h4><pre>
       (This section does not apply to the Mac OS X version.)

       The  games  in  this collection deliberately do not ever save information on to the computer they run on:
       they have no high score tables and no saved preferences. (This is because I expect at least  some  people
       to play them at work, and those people will probably appreciate leaving as little evidence as possible!)

       However,  if  you do want to arrange for one of these games to default to a particular set of parameters,
       you can specify them on the command line.

       The easiest way to do this is to set up the parameters you want using the ‘Type’ menu  (see  above),  and
       then  to  select  ‘Random Seed’ from the ‘Game’ or ‘File’ menu (see above). The text in the ‘Game ID’ box
       will be composed of two parts, separated by a  hash.  The  first  of  these  parts  represents  the  game
       parameters (the size of the playing area, for example, and anything else you set using the ‘Type’ menu).

       If you run the game with just that parameter text on the command line, it will start up with the settings
       you specified.

       For  example: if you run Cube (see <u><a href="../man6/sgt-cube.6.html">sgt-cube</a></u>(6)), select ‘Octahedron’ from the ‘Type’ menu, and then go to
       the game ID selection, you will see a string of the  form  ‘<b>o2x2#338686542711620</b>’.  Take  only  the  part
       before the hash (‘<b>o2x2</b>’), and start Cube with that text on the command line: ‘<b>sgt-cube</b> <b>o2x2</b>’.

       If  you  copy the <u>entire</u> game ID on to the command line, the game will start up in the specific game that
       was described. This is occasionally a more convenient way to start a particular game ID than  by  pasting
       it into the game ID selection box.

       (You  could also retrieve the encoded game parameters using the ‘Specific’ menu option instead of ‘Random
       Seed’, but if you do then some options, such as the difficulty level in Solo, will be missing. See  above
       for more details on this.)

</pre><h4><b>Unix</b> <b>command-line</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       (This section only applies to the Unix port.)

       In  addition  to being able to specify game parameters on the command line (see above), there are various
       other options:

       <b>--game</b>

       <b>--load</b> These options respectively determine whether the command-line argument is  treated  as  specifying
              game  parameters or a save file to load. Only one should be specified. If neither of these options
              is specified, a guess is made based on the format of the argument.

       <b>--generate</b> <u>n</u>
              If this option is specified, instead of a puzzle being displayed, a number of descriptive game IDs
              will be invented and printed on standard output. This is useful for gaining  access  to  the  game
              generation algorithms without necessarily using the frontend.

              If  game parameters are specified on the command-line, they will be used to generate the game IDs;
              otherwise a default set of parameters will be used.

              The most common use of this option is in conjunction with <b>--print</b>, in which case its behaviour  is
              slightly different; see below.

       <b>--print</b> <u>w</u><b>x</b><u>h</u>
              If  this option is specified, instead of a puzzle being displayed, a printed representation of one
              or more unsolved puzzles is sent to standard output, in PostScript format.

              On each page of puzzles, there will be <u>w</u> across and <u>h</u> down. If there are more  puzzles  than  <u>w</u>×<u>h</u>,
              more than one page will be printed.

              If  <b>--generate</b> has also been specified, the invented game IDs will be used to generate the printed
              output. Otherwise, a list of game IDs is expected on standard input (which can be  descriptive  or
              random seeds; see above), in the same format produced by <b>--generate</b>.

              For example:

              sgt-net --generate 12 --print 2x3 7x7w | lpr

              will  generate two pages of printed Net puzzles (each of which will have a 7×7 wrapping grid), and
              pipe the output to the <b>lpr</b> command, which on many systems will send them to an actual printer.

              There are various other options which affect printing; see below.

       <b>--save</b> <u>file-prefix</u> [ <b>--save-suffix</b> <u>file-suffix</u> ]
              If this option is specified, instead of a puzzle being displayed, saved-game files for one or more
              unsolved puzzles are written to files constructed from the supplied prefix and/or suffix.

              If <b>--generate</b> has also been specified, the invented game IDs will be used to generate the  printed
              output.  Otherwise,  a list of game IDs is expected on standard input (which can be descriptive or
              random seeds; see above), in the same format produced by <b>--generate</b>.

              For example:

              sgt-net --generate 12 --save game --save-suffix .sav

              will generate twelve Net saved-game files with the names <b>game0.sav</b> to <b>game11.sav</b>.

       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information about the game, and then quits.

       The following options are only meaningful if <b>--print</b> is also specified:

       <b>--with-solutions</b>
              The set of pages filled with unsolved puzzles will be followed by the solutions to those puzzles.

       <b>--scale</b> <u>n</u>
              Adjusts how big each puzzle is when printed. Larger numbers make puzzles bigger;  the  default  is
              1.0.

       <b>--colour</b>
              Puzzles will be printed in colour, rather than in black and white (if supported by the puzzle).
