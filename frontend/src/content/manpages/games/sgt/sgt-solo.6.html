       <b>sgt-solo</b> - Number placement puzzle

       <b>sgt-solo</b> <b>--version</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You have a square grid, which is divided into as many equally sized sub-blocks as the grid has rows. Each
       square must be filled in with a digit from 1 to the size of the grid, in such a way that

       <b>•</b>      every row contains only one occurrence of each digit

       <b>•</b>      every column contains only one occurrence of each digit

       <b>•</b>      every block contains only one occurrence of each digit.

       <b>•</b>      (optionally, by default off) each of the square's two main diagonals contains only one  occurrence
              of each digit.

       You are given some of the numbers as clues; your aim is to place the rest of the numbers correctly.

       Under  the  default settings, the sub-blocks are square or rectangular. The default puzzle size is 3×3 (a
       9×9 actual grid, divided into nine 3×3 blocks). You can also select sizes with rectangular blocks instead
       of square ones, such as 2×3 (a 6×6 grid divided into six  3×2  blocks).  Alternatively,  you  can  select
       ‘jigsaw’ mode, in which the sub-blocks are arbitrary shapes which differ between individual puzzles.

       Another  available  mode is ‘killer’. In this mode, clues are not given in the form of filled-in squares;
       instead, the grid is divided into ‘cages’ by coloured lines, and for each cage the game  tells  you  what
       the sum of all the digits in that cage should be. Also, no digit may appear more than once within a cage,
       even if the cage crosses the boundaries of existing regions.

       If  you  select a puzzle size which requires more than 9 digits, the additional digits will be letters of
       the alphabet. For example, if you select 3×4 then the digits which go in your grid will be 1 to  9,  plus
       ‘<b>a</b>’, ‘<b>b</b>’ and ‘<b>c</b>’. This cannot be selected for killer puzzles.

       I  first saw this puzzle in Nikoli (<b>https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/sudoku/</b>), although it's also been
       popularised by various newspapers under the name ‘Sudoku’ or ‘Su Doku’. Howard Garns  is  considered  the
       inventor  of  the  modern  form of the puzzle, and it was first published in <u>Dell</u> <u>Pencil</u> <u>Puzzles</u> <u>and</u> <u>Word</u>
       <u>Games</u>.  A  more  elaborate  treatment  of  the  history  of  the  puzzle  can  be  found   on   Wikipedia
       (<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku</a></b>).

</pre><h4><b>Solo</b> <b>controls</b></h4><pre>
       To  play Solo, simply click the mouse in any empty square and then type a digit or letter on the keyboard
       to fill that square. If you make a mistake, click the mouse in the incorrect square and  press  Space  to
       clear it again (or use the Undo feature).

       If  you  <u>right</u>-click  in  a square and then type a number, that number will be entered in the square as a
       ‘pencil mark’. You can have pencil marks for multiple numbers in  the  same  square.  Squares  containing
       filled-in numbers cannot also contain pencil marks.

       The  game  pays  no attention to pencil marks, so exactly what you use them for is up to you: you can use
       them as reminders that a particular square needs to be re-examined once you know more about a  particular
       number, or you can use them as lists of the possible numbers in a given square, or anything else you feel
       like.

       To erase a single pencil mark, right-click in the square and type the same number again.

       All pencil marks in a square are erased when you left-click and type a number, or when you left-click and
       press space. Right-clicking and pressing space will also erase pencil marks.

       Alternatively,  use the cursor keys to move the mark around the grid. Pressing the return key toggles the
       mark (from a normal mark to a pencil mark), and typing a number in  is  entered  in  the  square  in  the
       appropriate way; typing in a 0 or using the space bar will clear a filled square.

       (All the actions described below are also available.)

</pre><h4><b>Solo</b> <b>parameters</b></h4><pre>
       Solo allows you to configure two separate dimensions of the puzzle grid on the ‘Type’ menu: the number of
       columns, and the number of rows, into which the main grid is divided. (The size of a block is the inverse
       of  this:  for  example,  if you select 2 columns and 3 rows, each actual block will have 3 columns and 2
       rows.)

       If you tick the ‘X’ checkbox, Solo will apply the optional extra constraint that the two  main  diagonals
       of  the  grid  also contain one of every digit. (This is sometimes known as ‘Sudoku-X’ in newspapers.) In
       this mode, the squares on the two main diagonals will be shaded slightly so that you know it's enabled.

       If you tick the ‘Jigsaw’ checkbox, Solo will generate randomly  shaped  sub-blocks.  In  this  mode,  the
       actual  grid  size  will  be  taken  to be the product of the numbers entered in the ‘Columns’ and ‘Rows’
       boxes. There is no reason why you have to enter a number greater than 1 in both boxes; Jigsaw mode has no
       constraint on the grid size, and it can even be a prime number if you feel like it.

       If you tick the ‘Killer’ checkbox, Solo will generate a set of of cages, which are  randomly  shaped  and
       drawn  in an outline of a different colour. Each of these regions contains a smaller clue which shows the
       digit sum of all the squares in this region.

       You can also configure the type of symmetry shown in the  generated  puzzles.  More  symmetry  makes  the
       puzzles  look prettier but may also make them easier, since the symmetry constraints can force more clues
       than necessary to be present. Completely asymmetric puzzles have the freedom to contain as few  clues  as
       possible.

       Finally,  you  can configure the difficulty of the generated puzzles. Difficulty levels are judged by the
       complexity of the techniques of deduction required to solve the puzzle: each level  requires  a  mode  of
       reasoning  which was not necessary in the previous one. In particular, on difficulty levels ‘Trivial’ and
       ‘Basic’ there will be a square  you  can  fill  in  with  a  single  number  at  all  times,  whereas  at
       ‘Intermediate’  level  and  beyond  you  will  have to make partial deductions about the <u>set</u> of squares a
       number could be in (or the set of numbers that could be in a square). At ‘Unreasonable’ level, even  this
       is  not  enough,  and  you will eventually have to make a guess, and then backtrack if it turns out to be
       wrong.

       Generating difficult puzzles is itself difficult: if you select one of the higher difficulty levels, Solo
       may have to make many attempts at generating a puzzle before  it  finds  one  hard  enough  for  you.  Be
       prepared to wait, especially if you have also configured a large puzzle size.

</pre><h4><b>Common</b> <b>actions</b></h4><pre>
       These actions are all available from the ‘Game’ menu and via keyboard shortcuts, in addition to any game-
       specific actions.

       (On  Mac  OS  X, to conform with local user interface standards, these actions are situated on the ‘File’
       and ‘Edit’ menus instead.)

       <u>New</u> <u>game</u> (‘N’, Ctrl+‘N’)
              Starts a new game, with a random initial state.

       <u>Restart</u> <u>game</u>
              Resets the current game to its initial state. (This can be undone.)

       <u>Load</u>   Loads a saved game from a file on disk.

       <u>Save</u>   Saves the current state of your game to a file on disk.

              The Load and Save operations preserve your entire game history (so you can save, reload, and still
              Undo and Redo things you had done before saving).

       <u>Print</u>  Where supported (currently only on Windows), brings up a dialog allowing you to print an arbitrary
              number of puzzles randomly generated from the current parameters, optionally including the current
              puzzle. (Only for puzzles which make sense to print, of course – it's hard to think of a  sensible
              printable representation of Fifteen!)

       <u>Undo</u> (‘U’, Ctrl+‘Z’, Ctrl+‘_’, ‘*’)
              Undoes a single move. (You can undo moves back to the start of the session.)

       <u>Redo</u> (‘R’, Ctrl+‘R’, ‘#’)
              Redoes a previously undone move.

       <u>Copy</u>   Copies  the  current  state of your game to the clipboard in text format, so that you can paste it
              into (say) an e-mail client or a web message board if you're  discussing  the  game  with  someone
              else. (Not all games support this feature.)

       <u>Solve</u>  Transforms  the  puzzle instantly into its solved state. For some games (Cube) this feature is not
              supported at all because it is of no particular use. For other games (such as Pattern), the solved
              state can be used to give you information, if you can't see how a solution can exist at all or you
              want to know where you made a mistake. For still other games (such as Sixteen), automatic solution
              tells you nothing about how to <u>get</u> to the solution, but it does provide a useful way to get  there
              quickly so that you can experiment with set-piece moves and transformations.

              Some games (such as Solo) are capable of solving a game ID you have typed in from elsewhere. Other
              games  (such  as Rectangles) cannot solve a game ID they didn't invent themself, but when they did
              invent the game ID they know what the solution is already. Still other games (Pattern)  can  solve
              <u>some</u> external game IDs, but only if they aren't too difficult.

              The  ‘Solve’  command  adds the solved state to the end of the undo chain for the puzzle. In other
              words, if you want to go back to solving it yourself after seeing the answer, you can  just  press
              Undo.

       <u>Quit</u> (‘Q’, Ctrl+‘Q’)
              Closes the application entirely.

</pre><h4><b>Specifying</b> <b>games</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>ID</b></h4><pre>
       There  are two ways to save a game specification out of a puzzle and recreate it later, or recreate it in
       somebody else's copy of the same puzzle.

       The ‘Specific’ and ‘Random Seed’ options from the ‘Game’ menu (or the ‘File’ menu, on Mac OS X) each show
       a piece of text (a ‘game ID’) which is sufficient to reconstruct precisely the same game at a later date.

       You can enter either of these pieces of text back into the program (via the same  ‘Specific’  or  ‘Random
       Seed’  menu options) at a later point, and it will recreate the same game. You can also use either one as
       a command line argument (on Windows or Unix); see below for more detail.

       The difference between the two forms is that a descriptive game  ID  is  a  literal  <u>description</u>  of  the
       initial  state of the game, whereas a random seed is just a piece of arbitrary text which was provided as
       input to the random number generator used to create the puzzle. This means that:

       <b>•</b>      Descriptive game IDs tend to be longer in many puzzles (although some, such as Cube (<u><a href="../man6/sgt-cube.6.html">sgt-cube</a></u>(6)),
              only need very short descriptions). So a random seed is often a  <u>quicker</u>  way  to  note  down  the
              puzzle  you're  currently playing, or to tell it to somebody else so they can play the same one as
              you.

       <b>•</b>      Any text at all is a valid  random  seed.  The  automatically  generated  ones  are  fifteen-digit
              numbers,  but  anything will do; you can type in your full name, or a word you just made up, and a
              valid puzzle will be generated from it. This provides a way for two or  more  people  to  race  to
              complete the same puzzle: you think of a random seed, then everybody types it in at the same time,
              and nobody has an advantage due to having seen the generated puzzle before anybody else.

       <b>•</b>      It  is  often possible to convert puzzles from other sources (such as ‘nonograms’ or ‘sudoku’ from
              newspapers) into descriptive game IDs suitable for use with these programs.

       <b>•</b>      Random seeds are not guaranteed to produce the same result  if  you  use  them  with  a  different
              <u>version</u>  of  the puzzle program. This is because the generation algorithm might have been improved
              or modified in later versions of the code, and will therefore  produce  a  different  result  when
              given  the  same  sequence of random numbers. Use a descriptive game ID if you aren't sure that it
              will be used on the same version of the program as yours.

              (Use the ‘About’ menu option to find out the version number of the program. Programs with the same
              version number running on different platforms should still be random-seed compatible.)

       A descriptive game ID starts with a piece of text which encodes the <u>parameters</u> of the current game  (such
       as  grid  size).  Then there is a colon, and after that is the description of the game's initial state. A
       random seed starts with a similar string of parameters, but then it contains  a  hash  sign  followed  by
       arbitrary data.

       If  you  enter  a  descriptive  game  ID,  the program will not be able to show you the random seed which
       generated it, since it wasn't generated <u>from</u> a random seed. If you <u>enter</u>  a  random  seed,  however,  the
       program will be able to show you the descriptive game ID derived from that random seed.

       Note  that  the  game  parameter  strings are not always identical between the two forms. For some games,
       there will be parameter data provided with the random seed which is not included in the descriptive  game
       ID.  This is because that parameter information is only relevant when <u>generating</u> puzzle grids, and is not
       important when playing them. Thus, for example, the difficulty level in Solo (above) is not mentioned  in
       the descriptive game ID.

       These  additional  parameters are also not set permanently if you type in a game ID. For example, suppose
       you have Solo set to ‘Advanced’ difficulty level, and then a friend wants  your  help  with  a  ‘Trivial’
       puzzle;  so  the  friend reads out a random seed specifying ‘Trivial’ difficulty, and you type it in. The
       program will generate you the same ‘Trivial’ grid which your friend was having trouble with, but once you
       have finished playing it, when you ask for a new game it will automatically go  back  to  the  ‘Advanced’
       difficulty which it was previously set on.

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>‘Type’</b> <b>menu</b></h4><pre>
       The  ‘Type’  menu,  if  present,  may contain a list of preset game settings. Selecting one of these will
       start a new random game with the parameters specified.

       The ‘Type’ menu may also contain a ‘Custom’ option which allows you to  fine-tune  game  parameters.  The
       parameters available are specific to each game and are described in the following sections.

</pre><h4><b>Specifying</b> <b>game</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b></h4><pre>
       (This section does not apply to the Mac OS X version.)

       The  games  in  this collection deliberately do not ever save information on to the computer they run on:
       they have no high score tables and no saved preferences. (This is because I expect at least  some  people
       to play them at work, and those people will probably appreciate leaving as little evidence as possible!)

       However,  if  you do want to arrange for one of these games to default to a particular set of parameters,
       you can specify them on the command line.

       The easiest way to do this is to set up the parameters you want using the ‘Type’ menu  (see  above),  and
       then  to  select  ‘Random Seed’ from the ‘Game’ or ‘File’ menu (see above). The text in the ‘Game ID’ box
       will be composed of two parts, separated by a  hash.  The  first  of  these  parts  represents  the  game
       parameters (the size of the playing area, for example, and anything else you set using the ‘Type’ menu).

       If you run the game with just that parameter text on the command line, it will start up with the settings
       you specified.

       For  example: if you run Cube (see <u><a href="../man6/sgt-cube.6.html">sgt-cube</a></u>(6)), select ‘Octahedron’ from the ‘Type’ menu, and then go to
       the game ID selection, you will see a string of the  form  ‘<b>o2x2#338686542711620</b>’.  Take  only  the  part
       before the hash (‘<b>o2x2</b>’), and start Cube with that text on the command line: ‘<b>sgt-cube</b> <b>o2x2</b>’.

       If  you  copy the <u>entire</u> game ID on to the command line, the game will start up in the specific game that
       was described. This is occasionally a more convenient way to start a particular game ID than  by  pasting
       it into the game ID selection box.

       (You  could also retrieve the encoded game parameters using the ‘Specific’ menu option instead of ‘Random
       Seed’, but if you do then some options, such as the difficulty level in Solo, will be missing. See  above
       for more details on this.)

</pre><h4><b>Unix</b> <b>command-line</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       (This section only applies to the Unix port.)

       In  addition  to being able to specify game parameters on the command line (see above), there are various
       other options:

       <b>--game</b>

       <b>--load</b> These options respectively determine whether the command-line argument is  treated  as  specifying
              game  parameters or a save file to load. Only one should be specified. If neither of these options
              is specified, a guess is made based on the format of the argument.

       <b>--generate</b> <u>n</u>
              If this option is specified, instead of a puzzle being displayed, a number of descriptive game IDs
              will be invented and printed on standard output. This is useful for gaining  access  to  the  game
              generation algorithms without necessarily using the frontend.

              If  game parameters are specified on the command-line, they will be used to generate the game IDs;
              otherwise a default set of parameters will be used.

              The most common use of this option is in conjunction with <b>--print</b>, in which case its behaviour  is
              slightly different; see below.

       <b>--print</b> <u>w</u><b>x</b><u>h</u>
              If  this option is specified, instead of a puzzle being displayed, a printed representation of one
              or more unsolved puzzles is sent to standard output, in PostScript format.

              On each page of puzzles, there will be <u>w</u> across and <u>h</u> down. If there are more  puzzles  than  <u>w</u>×<u>h</u>,
              more than one page will be printed.

              If  <b>--generate</b> has also been specified, the invented game IDs will be used to generate the printed
              output. Otherwise, a list of game IDs is expected on standard input (which can be  descriptive  or
              random seeds; see above), in the same format produced by <b>--generate</b>.

              For example:

              sgt-net --generate 12 --print 2x3 7x7w | lpr

              will  generate two pages of printed Net puzzles (each of which will have a 7×7 wrapping grid), and
              pipe the output to the <b>lpr</b> command, which on many systems will send them to an actual printer.

              There are various other options which affect printing; see below.

       <b>--save</b> <u>file-prefix</u> [ <b>--save-suffix</b> <u>file-suffix</u> ]
              If this option is specified, instead of a puzzle being displayed, saved-game files for one or more
              unsolved puzzles are written to files constructed from the supplied prefix and/or suffix.

              If <b>--generate</b> has also been specified, the invented game IDs will be used to generate the  printed
              output.  Otherwise,  a list of game IDs is expected on standard input (which can be descriptive or
              random seeds; see above), in the same format produced by <b>--generate</b>.

              For example:

              sgt-net --generate 12 --save game --save-suffix .sav

              will generate twelve Net saved-game files with the names <b>game0.sav</b> to <b>game11.sav</b>.

       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information about the game, and then quits.

       The following options are only meaningful if <b>--print</b> is also specified:

       <b>--with-solutions</b>
              The set of pages filled with unsolved puzzles will be followed by the solutions to those puzzles.

       <b>--scale</b> <u>n</u>
              Adjusts how big each puzzle is when printed. Larger numbers make puzzles bigger;  the  default  is
              1.0.

       <b>--colour</b>
              Puzzles will be printed in colour, rather than in black and white (if supported by the puzzle).
