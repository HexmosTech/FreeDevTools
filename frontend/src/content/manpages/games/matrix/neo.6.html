</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       neo - simulate the digital rain from "The Matrix"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>neo</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>neo</b>  recreates  the  digital  rain  effect from "The Matrix". Streams of random characters will endlessly
       scroll down your terminal screen. There are many differing  depictions  of  this  effect  throughout  the
       Matrix  franchise.   <b>neo</b>  attempts to closely mimic the scene from "The Matrix" where Cypher explains the
       code to Neo. It imitates some of the finer details such as the  characters  used  (half-width  katakana),
       uneven colors, color palette, glitching, and flickering.

       The  digital rain is made of many "droplets". Each droplet scrolls vertically down a column. There can be
       multiple droplets in each column. Some characters on the screen are "glitched" - their values will change
       randomly until they are erased. The bottom of each droplet is a bit brighter than the rest.

       You can run <b>neo</b> without any arguments, but it has many options to customize it to  your  liking.  It  can
       also  respond  to key presses (try pressing a number!), and it accepts a color file (see the "COLOR FILE"
       section below), which allows <b>neo</b> to display user-defined colors.  <b>neo</b>  will  use  Unicode  characters  by
       default if it detects a locale that supports UTF.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>neo</b>  takes  options  in  two  forms:  short and long. Short options cannot include an equal sign but long
       options can. Example for -S/--speed:

              These will work:

                     -S 16
                     --speed 16
                     --speed=16

              These will not:

                     -S=16
                     --S 16

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--async</b>
              Makes each column of characters scroll at an independent  speed.  Each  column's  speed  is  still
              limited by the <b>-S</b>/<b>--speed</b> arg. All droplets in a column will always scroll at the speed.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--bold</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              Controls if and how neo displays bold characters.  0=off, 1=random (default), 2=all.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--colorfile</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Read  the  colors  from  a  file.  This  option  is  mutually  exclusive  with  the <b>-c</b>/<b>--color</b> and
              <b>--colormode=0</b> options. See the "COLOR FILE" section below for more info.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--color</b>=<u>COLOR</u>
              Sets the foreground text color. This option is mutually  exclusive  with  the  <b>-C</b>/<b>--colorfile</b>  and
              <b>--colormode=0</b> options. The available colors are: green, green2, green3, yellow, orange, red, blue,
              cyan, gold, rainbow, purple, pink, pink2, vaporwave, and gray.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--defaultbg</b>
              Use   the  default  terminal  background  color.  This  option  is  mutually  exclusive  with  the
              <b>-C</b>/<b>--colorfile</b> and <b>--colormode=0</b> options.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--density</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              Controls how many droplets will appear onscreen. NUM is a decimal number.  Its  default  value  is
              1.0.  Values greater than 0.0 but less than 100.0 are allowed. However, values in the range [0.25,
              4.0] will probably look best.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--fullwidth</b>
              Use two columns per character. This option is useful when  displaying  characters  that  take  two
              columns to display such as Greek and full-width katakana.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--fps</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              Sets  a  frame rate target. By default, <b>neo</b> will run at 60Hz. <b>neo</b> does not attempt to query the OS
              for any display info. So it can't match your monitor's refresh rate by default unless  it  happens
              to be 60Hz. Lower frame rates will reduce CPU usage and improve battery life on portable devices.

       <b>-G</b>, <b>--glitchpct</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              Sets  the  percentage  of characters onscreen that glitch. NUM is a decimal number between 0.0 and
              100.0 inclusive. The default value is 10.0 (i.e. 10%).

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--glitchms</b>=<u>NUM1</u>,<u>NUM2</u>
              Controls how often the characters on screen glitch. A "glitch" refers to when a character  changes
              into  another.  Each  glitch is accompanied by a flickering of the character's color if colors are
              enabled. After each glitch, neo will wait for some time before doing the next glitch. The time  it
              waits  is  chosen  randomly  to  be between the two values provided (inclusive). NUM1 and NUM2 are
              positive integers that represent milliseconds. Their default values are 300 and 400.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Shows the help message.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--lingerms</b>=<u>NUM1</u>,<u>NUM2</u>
              Controls how long characters stay onscreen after they finish scrolling. For each column, neo  will
              pick  a  random  value  between NUM1 and NUM2 inclusive.  NUM1 and NUM2 are positive integers that
              represent milliseconds. The default values are 1 and 3000.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--shadingmode</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              Controls how  neo  assigns  color  values  to  characters  on  the  screen.   0=random  (default),
              1=gradient.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--message</b>=<u>STR</u>
              Displays  a  message in the center of the screen. The message is gradually uncovered as characters
              stream past it. This effect is similar to the title reveal in the movies. The  message  should  be
              surrounded  with  double  quotes.   neo  parses arguments using getopt_long(), which does not have
              Unicode support.  So, unfortunately, this argument only accepts simple  ASCII  text.  The  message
              will  not  display  well if you also use the <b>-F</b>/<b>--fullwidth</b> option.  To unveil the message faster,
              the following options may help:

                     <b>neo</b> -m "the message" --speed=12 --density=3 --lingerms=1,1 --rippct=0

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--profile</b>
              Turns on the profiling mode. This mode functions as normal except it times  how  long  each  frame
              takes and writes the values to a file called "time_profile.txt" in the current working directory.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--rippct</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              Sets  the percentage of droplets that stop scrolling before reaching the bottom of the screen. NUM
              is a decimal number between 0.0 and 100.0 inclusive. The default  value  is  33.0  (i.e.  about  a
              third).

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--speed</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              Controls  how fast characters scroll down the screen. NUM is a decimal number that sets the number
              of characters drawn per second. The default value is 8.0.  If <b>-a</b>/<b>--async</b> is used, this option sets
              an upper bound on the value chosen for each droplet's speed.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--screensaver</b>
              If this option is set, <b>neo</b> will exit on the first key press.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Displays the version, build date, copyright, and license.

       <b>--chars</b>=<u>NUM1</u>,<u>NUM2</u>
              Tells <b>neo</b> to display Unicode characters between NUM1  and  NUM2  inclusive.   NUM1  and  NUM2  are
              Unicode  code  points  in hexadecimal (e.g. 0x1F030). This argument can be used multiple times. If
              <b>--charset</b> is not used, <b>neo</b> will only use the values provided by this option. If a charset is  also
              specified, <b>neo</b> will use both the charset and the characters provided by this option.

       <b>--charset</b>=<u>LANG</u>
              Sets  the  charset  that  is  used to draw characters onto the screen. It can be combined with the
              <b>--chars</b> option. The supported charsets are: ascii, extended, english, dec, decimal, digits,  punc,
              bin, binary, hex, hexadecimal, katakana, greek, cyrillic, arabic, hebrew, devanagari, braille, and
              runic.

       <b>--colormode</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              Sets  the color mode. The accepted values are 0, 16, 32, and 256. 0 disables color (i.e. mono). 16
              selects 16 colors. 32 selects 32-bit color. 256 selects 256 colors.

       <b>--maxdpc</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              Sets the maximum number of droplets per column. The default value is 3.

       <b>--noglitch</b>
              Disables character glitching.

       <b>--shortpct</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              Sets the percentage of shortened droplets. If a droplet is not shortened, it will extend from  the
              top of the screen to final line, which is often the bottom of the screen but not always (see also:
              <b>-r</b>/<b>--rippct</b>).   NUM is a decimal number between 0.0 and 100.0 inclusive. The default value is 50.0
              (i.e. 50%).

</pre><h4><b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       You can press keys while <b>neo</b> is running to control its behavior.  The  key  bindings  cannot  be  changed
       without  modifying  the  program  code.  Some  keys can be held to increase their effect (e.g. holding UP
       increases speed further).

       Here are the available key controls:

              ´SPACE' - clears the screen
              ´UP' - increases the scrolling speed
              ´DOWN' - decreases the scrolling speed
              ´RIGHT' - increases the number of characters that are glitchy
              ´LEFT' - decreases the number of characters that are glitchy
              ´TAB' - toggles the shading mode between random and gradient
              ´ESC' - exits <b>neo</b>
              ´+' - increases the number of droplets onscreen
              ´-' - decreases the number of droplets onscreen
              ´a' - toggles asynchronous droplet speed
              ´p' - pauses <b>neo</b>
              ´q' - exits <b>neo</b>
              ´1' - sets the color to green
              ´2' - sets the color to green2
              ´3' - sets the color to green3
              ´4' - sets the color to gold
              ´5' - sets the color to pink2
              ´6' - sets the color to red
              ´7' - sets the color to blue
              ´8' - sets the color to cyan
              ´9' - sets the color to purple
              ´0' - sets the color to gray
              ´!' - sets the color to rainbow
              ´@' - sets the color to yellow
              ´#' - sets the color to orange
              ´$' - sets the color to pink
              ´%' - sets the color to vaporwave

</pre><h4><b>COLOR</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>neo</b> can read a file that specifies the background color and all the foreground colors. The file is  given
       via the <b>-C/--colorfile</b> option.

       You  can write comments using "//", "#", ";", "*", or "@". Comments can go on separate lines or after the
       data on any line. The first line that is not blank or a comment <u>should</u> be the version string. The version
       string line should look like:

              neo_color_version N

       where "N" is the color file version number, which is currently 1.  The version string is optional, and if
       it is omitted, then <b>neo</b> will assume that the file adheres to the  latest  version's  format.  This  could
       potentially  break old color files. Ye have been warned! <b>neo</b> will try to maintain backwards compatability
       with older color file versions so long as their version is actually given.

       Each data line in the file describes a color. The first line is the  background  color.  Each  subsequent
       line  describes a foreground color. Each file must contain at least two lines: one for the background and
       one for the foreground. Typically, you will want to put the  foreground  colors  in  order  of  ascending
       brightness. <b>neo</b> will not sort the colors. The last color should usually be very bright (e.g. white).

       Each  data line in the file specifies one value or four values. If only one value is given, it is treated
       as a 16 or 256 terminal color code (e.g. 16 is black).  If four values are given, the first is treated as
       a 16/256 color code and the other three are the RGB components of the 32-bit color. Each component  is  a
       value from 0 to 1000, which closely mimics how ncurses handles color. Each value is separated by a comma,
       and whitespace is allowed.

       If  more than one value is given on a line, then all four values must be given.  Lines do not all have to
       have the same number of components i.e. some lines can just specify the 16/256 color  code  while  others
       can specify all four values.

       On most systems, if a value of "-1" is provided for the 16/256 color code, this will set the color to the
       system default. This can be useful if you want to keep the default background.

       All  ncurses  implementations  should  allow you to override at least the first 256 colors, assuming your
       terminal supports it. Some will let you override even more than that. ncurses should restore  all  colors
       back to their previous state as long as <b>neo</b> exits cleanly.

       If either of the 16 or 256 colormode options is used, all 32-bit RGB components in the color file will be
       parsed if they are given, but they will be unused.

       Example 1: Blue text on a red background using only 256 color codes

              196
              21

       Example 2: Different shades of purple text on a yellow background with some 32-bit color components

              228,917,888,59
              54
              92
              129,750,963,128

       Example 3: Default background and various shades of green using only 256 color codes

              -1
              34
              40
              46
              82
              231

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>neo</b>  can have two main performance issues: high CPU utilization and stuttering.  A terminal emulator with
       GPU acceleration (e.g. Alacritty) may significantly improve these issues.  The  CPU  utilization  by  <b>neo</b>
       itself  is fairly low, even at high frame rates on large screens. However, your terminal emulator may use
       substantial CPU resources to draw everything.  Without a fast terminal emulator, this application may use
       up a whole CPU core or three.

       Sometimes the text will not scroll smoothly. Again, a fast terminal emulator will probably help. You will
       also typically want the frame rate (i.e. --fps) to be evenly  divisible  by  the  character  speed  (i.e.
       -S/--speed).   Sometimes,  the  glitching  effect will lead to stuttering because a substantial number of
       characters onscreen will have to be redrawn. Reducing the glitchiness  (i.e.  --glitchpct)  or  disabling
       glitching (i.e. --noglitch) may help.

       If you experience performance issues, here are some things to try:

              1. Use a GPU-accelerated terminal emulator
              2. Run <b>neo</b> on a smaller screen/window
              3. Reduce the frame rate (e.g. --fps=30)
              4. Reduce the number of droplets onscreen (e.g. -d 0.5)
              5. Reduce the character speed (e.g. --speed=6)
              6. Disabling glitching (i.e. --noglitch)
              7. Disable colors (i.e. --colormode=0)
              8. Disable bold characters (i.e. --bold=0)
              9. Disable Unicode characters (i.e. --charset=ascii)

       Here is a "potato mode" config that should perform well on most systems:

              <b>neo</b> --fps=20 -d 0.5 --speed=5 --noglitch --colormode=0 --bold=0 --charset=ascii

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Example 0: Just run it

              <b>neo</b>

       Example 1: Sets a faster, asynchronous scrolling speed with 256 colors

              <b>neo</b> -S 12 -a --color=green3 --colormode=256

       Example 2: Red text with a custom message and Cyrillic characters

              <b>neo</b> --color=red --charset=cyrillic -m "IN SOVIET RUSSIA, COMPUTER PROGRAMS YOU!"

       Example 3: Displays golden Greek characters that are full-width

              <b>neo</b> --color=gold --charset=greek -F

       Example 4: Uses <b>--chars</b> to draw Unicode dominoes

              <b>neo</b> --chars=0x1F030,0x1F093 --fullwidth
