</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       renpy - engine for creating visual novels

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>renpy</b> <b>[path</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>script</b> <b>directory]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Ren'Py  is  a programming language and runtime, intended to ease the creation of visual-novel type games.
       It contains features that make it easy to display thoughts, dialogue, and menus; to display images to the
       user; to write game logic; and to support the saving and loading of games.

       Ren'Py tries to be like an executable script, allowing you to get a working game without much more effort
       than is required to type the game script into the computer.

       Ren'Py is implemented on top of python, and that python heritage  shows  through  in  many  places.  Many
       Ren'Py  statements  allow  python expressions to be used, and there are also Ren'Py statements that allow
       for the execution of arbitrary python code. Many of the less-used features of Ren'Py are exposed  to  the
       user  by  way of python. By only requiring use of the simplest features of python, it's hoped that Ren'Py
       will be usable by all game authors.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       If you run the program without any arguments, zou will get an interactive launcher  from  where  you  can
       select, run and work different projects.

       For  running a script, you need to give the full path to the directory that contains the game you want to
       play.

       For example: renpy /usr/share/games/renpy/demo/

       To learn how to use the game interface, you should install and play renpy-demo.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The game data for each user is stored at <a href="file:~/.renpy/">~/.renpy/</a> directory.

       The scripts can be installed in the system bz placing them under /usr/share/games/renpy/ ,  but  you  can
       run any script in an arbitrarz directory just by telling the path as the parameter to the game.
