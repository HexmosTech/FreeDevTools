</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       runescape  -  is  a massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Start your adventure, complete quests
       and win enormous treasures in a 3D world of magic and monsters.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROLS</b></h4><pre>
       Game controls in Runescape are quite basic, being  mostly  mouse  driven,  with  occasional  use  of  the
       keyboard.

       <b>MOUSE</b> <b>CLICK</b> <b>(PRIMARY)</b>

       Clicking the primary (normally left) mouse button results in the default action for the situation.

       A few examples:
       * On the main view or minimap (radar): Walk to the position.
       * On a character that can be attacked, and is not a red level: Attack the character.
       * On an NPC: Talk to.
       * On an item in your inventory: Wear, wield or eat it, or "use with" if no other action applies.
       * On an item on the ground: Take the most expensive (in shop value) item from the pile.
       * In the bank, on the bank screen or inventory: Transfer one item.

       If there are many characters or items in one spot, the default action may not select the object you want,
       a particular example being someone standing in a fire, when you try to cook fish.

       <b>MOUSE</b> <b>CLICK</b> <b>(SECONDARY)</b>

       Clicking  the  secondary  (normally right) mouse button offers a list of all possible targets that can be
       selected, or options to deal with more than one item.
       In the example above, you would click the fish you have,  then  secondary  click  the  player  and  fire,
       choosing "use with fire".
       In the bank, you can avoid the usual dialog by using secondary click and "use quickly".
       Another  time  you  must  secondary  click, is when combining two food items which are both edible, and a
       couple of other situations where you would otherwise eat or drink an item instead of handing it over.
       If your mouse only has one button, you can set the Mouse Buttons option to One, so that every mouse click
       will be treated as a secondary mouse click.

       <b>KEYBOARD</b>

       Running:
       --------
       Holding the CTRL key with any mouse click target means you will run to it, useful for running to take  an
       item, or to escape. Running may also be selected using a panel option, but all movement will be made at a
       run until walking is selected again, or your run energy falls to zero.

       Camera panning:
       ---------------
       The arrow keys are used to pan the main view and minimap, rotating or raising and lowering the viewpoint,
       though if close to a hill, it may not be possible to lower the viewpoint.
       The  middle  mouse button can also be used to pan, as well as moving the mouse while having Alt and left-
       click held down.
       While it can be useful to see items on the main view by rotating the map, holding the map  centred  north
       while  trying  to  navigate  is  highly recommended, as it is easy to forget the map angle and set off in
       completely the wrong direction.

       <b>NUMBERS</b>

       The keyboard is used to enter amounts, particularly of coins.  Using the 5, 10 or all options  for  other
       items is quicker, even if you have less, or don't have room to carry all.

       <b>CHAT</b>

       You have Public Chat, Private Chat, Clan Chat and Trade Chat.
       The keyboard can also be used for chat with other players.
       It  is  not  used to talk to NPCs in the game, as any responses are selected from a menu. You can use the
       spacebar instead of pressing "click here to continue", and you can use a number key instead of  selecting
       the response with your mouse.
