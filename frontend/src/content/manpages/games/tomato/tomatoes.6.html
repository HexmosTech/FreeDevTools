</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tomatoes - Tomatoes smashing game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tomatoes</b>

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>I</b>  <b>Have</b>  <b>No</b>  <b>Tomatoes</b>  is  an  extreme  leisure  time  activity idea of which culminates in the following
       question: How many tomatoes can you smash in ten short minutes? If you have the time to spare, this  game
       has the vegetables just waiting to be eliminated!

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Before  starting  the  game,  you  should know that the game uses OpenGL for hardware accelerated 2d &amp; 3d
       graphics. This means that you must have fully OpenGL compatible graphics card in your PC. Your card  also
       needs  to  be  able  to  use  512x512  textures, and this rules out Voodoo 1, 2 and 3 (limited to 256x256
       textures).

       As for the CPU and memory requirements, I'd recommend something along the lines of Pentium II (or an  AMD
       equivalent)  and  64MB.  The  game  works on much slower systems as well, as the game skips frames if the
       system can't keep up with the 60 FPS rate; this ensures that the game runs at the right speed,  you  just
       don't get very smooth animation.

       This game features solid game play with beautiful OpenGL API driven isometric 3d graphics and nice music.
       It  also includes a MOD player, and you can use your own MOD-type music in the game background. Just copy
       your XM/S3M/IT/MOD - files to the <u>music</u> subdirectory of <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>No</b> <b>Tomatoes</b> and the game plays  them.  You
       can press <b>F1</b> to skip a song when ingame. There's room for 128 MODs. Btw, if you don't have any MOD music,
       ModArchive (www.modarchive.com &lt;URL:www.modarchive.com&gt;) is a good place to download some.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       You  may also want to set some options, such as the screen resolution and color depth. By default, <b>I</b> <b>Have</b>
       <b>No</b> <b>Tomatoes</b> starts fullscreen in 800x600 resolution, 32bpp. To fine-tune the preferences to suit your  PC
       better,  open  the  file <u>config.cfg</u> in a text editor (Notepad will do). Under Unix this file is stored in
       <u><a href="file:~/.tomatoes/">~/.tomatoes/</a></u>.

       Most likely you'll be interested in these lines:

       • <b>video_mode</b> = 800 x 600

       • <b>video_mode_color_depth</b> = 32

       • <b>video_mode_fullscreen</b> = 1

       • <b>sound_enabled</b> = 1

       To set the resolution, change the <b>video_mode</b> - line (some common resolutions include 640  x  480,  800  x
       600,  1024  x  768).  Most  common  color  depths  are 16 and 32, and sometimes 24. <b>video_mode_fullscreen</b>
       controls whether the game starts in fullscreen or in a window. When running in windowed mode, you can use
       any resolution you want (the 4:3 aspect ratio modes are still preferred). If you don't have a sound  card
       (or want to turn the sounds off), set <b>sound_enabled</b> to 0 (zero).

       Finally,  if  you want to know how many frames your system draws per second (FPS), set <b>show_fps</b> to 1. FPS
       should be over 60 for smooth animation.

       The default keys can be changed from the Options menu in game, so no need change them here.

       When you're satisfied with the <u>config.cfg</u> settings, by all means, proceed to start the game :)
