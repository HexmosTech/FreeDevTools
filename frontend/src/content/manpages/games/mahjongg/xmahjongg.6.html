</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xmahjongg - colorful solitaire Mah Jongg game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xmahjongg</b> [<b>--display</b> <u>display</u>] [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Real  Mah  Jongg  is  a  social game that originated in China thousands of years ago. Four players, named
       after the four winds, take tiles from a wall in turn. The best tiles are made of  ivory  and  wood;  they
       click  pleasantly  when you knock them together. Computer Solitaire Mah Jongg (<b>xmahjongg</b> being one of the
       sillier examples) is nothing like that but it's fun, or it must be, since there are  like  300  shareware
       versions available for Windows.  This is for X11 and it's free.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>PLAY</b></h4><pre>
       The object is to remove all Mah Jongg tiles from the playing field by taking one matching pair at a time.
       Generally,  two tiles match if they have identical pictures on top. There are some exceptions: any season
       tile (spring, summer, autumn, or winter) matches any other season, and any flower tile  (bamboo,  orchid,
       plum,  or  chrysathemum)  matches  any other flower. There are 144 tiles in all -- one of each season and
       flower, and four copies of each of the following: 1 to 9 dots; 1 to 9 bamboo sticks; characters for 1  to
       9; the four winds (north, south, east, and west); and three dragons (red, green, and white).

       Only <u>free</u> <u>tiles</u> can be removed. A tile is free if its entire top face is unobstructed and either its left
       or  its  right  edge  is  open.  (When  looking at the left and right edges, only tiles on the same level
       count.)

       The rules are simple, but winning, it turns out, can be pretty hard. It's easy to make a move that causes
       a stalemate thirty or more moves later.  What's worse, the  <b>--any-boards</b>  option  lets  <b>xmahjongg</b>  create
       boards that cannot be solved at all!

</pre><h4><b>CONTROLS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>APPEARANCE</b></h4><pre>
       To select a free tile, simply click it with the left mouse button and it will light up. Click it again to
       deselect  it. If you try to select a non-free tile, <b>xmahjongg</b> will beep at you. To remove a matched pair,
       just select one of the pair and click on the other one. The number in the upper left corner tells you how
       many tiles you have left. This is all you really need to know to play the game.

       <b>Xmahjongg</b> comes with several features that may dismay purists, but make the game more pleasant  to  play.
       First  is  the  <u>match</u>  <u>count</u>,  an array of small gold coins in the upper middle. Each coin represents one
       potential match on the board. (If three mutually matching tiles are free, it counts as three matches, and
       if four are free, that's six matches.) This will let you know when the game is over (no gold coins  means
       no matches -- a dead end) and when you're getting close.

       The five buttons along the top right have the following functions:

       <b>New</b> (keystroke: <b>n</b>)
            Start a new game.

       <b>Quit</b> (keystroke: <b>q</b>)
            Quit <b>xmahjongg</b>.

       <b>Undo</b> (keystroke: <b>u</b>)
            Undoes  your  last  move. You can undo multiple moves by clicking multiple times. If you change your
            mind about undoing a move, hold down Shift while you click the Undo button (or press <b>r</b>) to redo it.

       <b>Hint</b> (keystroke: <b>h</b>)
            Gives you a hint by flashing a set of free matching  tiles.  You  can  cycle  through  all  existing
            matches  by  clicking multiple times. If you select a tile and then click Hint, <b>xmahjongg</b> will flash
            any free tiles that match that tile, or beep if there aren't any.

       <b>Clean</b> (keystroke: <b>c</b>)
            Cleans the board by automatically removing obvious matches. A match is obvious if  it  involves  all
            the  remaining  tiles  of a given type. (For example, if there are 2 green dragons left and they are
            both free, they form an obvious match; but if there are 4 left and only 3  are  free,  they  don't.)
            Cleaning the board is guaranteed not to cause a stalemate later.

       <b>Solve</b> (no button; keystroke: <b>s</b>)
            If you get stuck, press the <b>s</b> key. After the board is restored to its original state, <b>xmahjongg</b> will
            show  you  one  way  to  solve  it  by  removing  tiles two at a time. Press <b>s</b> again to speed up the
            solution, or press <b>Esc</b> to stop. This won't work if you gave the --any-boards option (see below).

       Additionally, the <b>Escape</b> key deselects any selected tile.

</pre><h4><b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>TRAVERSAL</b></h4><pre>
       You can use the arrow keys and the spacebar to play <b>xmahjongg</b> without using the mouse. These keys control
       the <u>cursor</u>, which is shown as a flashing tile. The arrow keys move the cursor around on the board in  the
       obvious  directions. The spacebar is like clicking the mouse button on the cursor tile: it either selects
       the tile or removes a matching pair.

       The hint key, `h', is also useful for playing without the mouse. Experiment with `h', the  spacebar,  and
       the  Return key to see how this works. When a hint is active, the spacebar is like clicking on one of the
       flashing hint tiles, while the Return key is like clicking on two of them (so it removes the tiles in one
       stroke). This method gives the fastest playing speed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If you get bored with <b>xmahjongg</b>'s original layout and appearance,  never  fear:  it  comes  with  several
       tilesets  (tile  images) and layouts (tile arrangements). In addition to these, <b>xmahjongg</b> can read layout
       files from the original xmahjongg, KDE Mahjongg, and Kyodai Mahjongg, and tilesets in KDE Mahjongg, Gnome
       Mahjongg, and Kyodai Mahjongg format. (However, tilesets must be converted to GIF format before <b>xmahjongg</b>
       can read them.) See the [<b>-l</b>] and [<b>-t</b>] options.

       Long option names can be abbreviated to their unique prefixes.

       <b>--number</b> <u>N</u>
       <b>-n</b> <u>N</u> Start with board number <u>N</u>.
       <b>-l</b> <u>layout</u>
       <b>--layout</b> <u>layout</u>
            Use the specified game layout.  <b>xmahjongg</b> comes with several layouts. The normal  layout  is  called
            <b>default</b>; to see the other ones' names, run `<b>xmahjongg</b> <b>--list</b>'.  You can also use an arbitrary layout
            by  giving  its  filename.   <b>Xmahjongg</b>  can  read layouts in its own simple format, in KDE kmahjongg
            format, or in Kyodai Mahjongg format. (Kyodai Mahjongg is one of the more popular Windows Mah  Jongg
            solitaire  games.  It's  got  3D  tiles  and  all sorts of stuff. See <a href="http://www.kyodai.com">http://www.kyodai.com</a> for more
            information. You can download a zip archive with more than 100 different layouts, mostly usable with
            <b>xmahjongg</b>, from <a href="http://www.kyodai.com/">http://www.kyodai.com/</a>.)

       <b>--tileset</b> <u>tileset</u>
            Use the specified tileset to draw the Mah Jongg tiles.  <b>Xmahjongg</b> comes with several extra tilesets,
            particularly <b>small</b> (perfect for smaller screens). There are others too; run `<b>xmahjongg</b> <b>--list</b>' for a
            complete listing.

       <b>--background</b> <u>image</u>
       <b>--bg</b> <u>image</u>
            The background image is set to <u>image</u>.  Run `<b>xmahjongg</b> <b>--list</b>' to see the backgrounds that come  with
            <b>xmahjongg</b>, or use an arbitrary GIF as a background image by giving its filename.

       [<b>--list</b>]
            Lists all the layouts, tilesets, and backgrounds that came with <b>xmahjongg</b>, then exits.

       <b>--solvable-boards</b>
            Always create solvable boards. This is the default.

       <b>--any-boards</b>
            Allow any legal board, some of which will be solvable and some of which won't.

       <b>--display</b> <u>display</u>
            Sets the X display to <u>display</u>.

       <b>--name</b> <u>name</u>
            Specifies   the  application  name  under  which  resources  are  found,  rather  than  the  default
            ``xmahjongg''. Since <b>xmahjongg</b> itself does not use the resource database, this is mostly useful  for
            communication with your window manager.

       <b>--geometry</b> <u>geometry</u>
            This standard X option specifies the preferred size and position for the <b>xmahjongg</b> window.

       [<b>--help</b>]
            Prints usage information and exits.

       [<b>--version</b>]
            Prints the version number and some quickie warranty information and exits.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xmahjongg</b> version 3 is a complete rewrite by Eddie Kohler &lt;<a href="mailto:eddietwo@lcs.mit.edu">eddietwo@lcs.mit.edu</a>&gt; of <b>xmahjongg</b> versions  1
       and 2 by Jeff S. Young &lt;<a href="mailto:jsy@cray.com">jsy@cray.com</a>&gt;.

       The  default tileset was originally created in color by Dorothy Robinson &lt;<a href="mailto:mokuren@teleport.com">mokuren@teleport.com</a>&gt; with Mark
       A. Holm &lt;<a href="mailto:markh@aracnet.com">markh@aracnet.com</a>&gt;. The publicly available version was in black-and-white. Holm copyrighted  the
       tiles  in  1988,  giving  permission  to  copy  and distribute for non-profit purposes. The significantly
       altered color version that comes with <b>xmahjongg</b> was created by Eddie Kohler in 1993. The `small'  tileset
       was  found  at  <a href="http://www.mahjongg.com/">http://www.mahjongg.com/</a>,  and  is  presumably  by Berrie Bloem. The `gnome' and `gnome2'
       tilesets were created by Jonathan Buzzard and Max Watson. The `dorothys'  and  `dorwhite'  tilesets  were
       made  by  Dorothy  Robinson  &lt;<a href="mailto:mokuren@teleport.com">mokuren@teleport.com</a>&gt;.  The  `real'  tileset  was scanned by Mark Sanctuary
       &lt;<a href="mailto:sanctuary@jps.net">sanctuary@jps.net</a>&gt;.

       Many of the layouts are based on layouts designed for Kyodai Mahjongg, a fun Windows Mah Jongg  game.  In
       particular,  `arena',  `ceremonial',  `deepwell',  `farandole',  and  `theater'  are  by  Naoki Haga, and
       `hourglass'   and   `papillon'   are   by   Vincent   Krebs.   Kyodai   Mahjongg's   Web   homepage    is
