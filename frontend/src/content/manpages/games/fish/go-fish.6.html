       go-fish — play “Go Fish”

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>go-fish</b> [<b>-p</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>go-fish</b> is the game “Go Fish”, a traditional children's card game.

       The  computer  deals  the  player  and  itself  seven  cards,  and  places the rest of the deck face-down
       (figuratively).  The object of the game is to collect “books”, or all of the members of  a  single  rank.
       For example, collecting four 2's would give the player a “book of 2's”.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-p</b>      Professional mode.

       The  computer  makes a random decision as to who gets to start the game, and then the computer and player
       take turns asking each other for cards of a specified rank.  If the asked player has  any  cards  of  the
       requested  rank, they give them up to the asking player.  A player must have at least one of the cards of
       the rank they request in their hand.  When a player asks for a rank of which  the  other  player  has  no
       cards,  the asker is told to “Go Fish!”.  Then, the asker draws a card from the non-dealt cards.  If they
       draw the card they asked for, they continue their turn, asking for more  ranks  from  the  other  player.
       Otherwise, the other player gets a turn.

       When  a  player completes a book, either by getting cards from the other player or drawing from the deck,
       they set those cards aside and the rank is no longer in play.

       The game ends when either player no longer has any cards in their hand.  The player with the  most  books
       wins.

       <b>go-fish</b> provides instructions as to what input it accepts.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The computer cheats only rarely.
