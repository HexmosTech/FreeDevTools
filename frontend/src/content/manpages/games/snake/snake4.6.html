</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       snake4, snake4scores - Game starring a fruit-eating snake.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>snake4</b> [-hHV] [-M file] [--help] [--highscores] [--version] [--merge-highscores=file]

       <b>snake4scores</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>snake4</b>  program  is  my  fourth implementation of the snake game, written for Unix and X11. Previous
       versions were written for MS-DOS.

       Move the snake around the screen and eat food. The snake grows in length as you eat.  Avoid  hitting  the
       fence, eating lethal mushrooms and rotten food, and biting your own tail.

       Now  and  then  a  slim-pill will bounce around. If you eat this, you will get shorter, and you will gain
       bonus points for every length you loose. The bonus is also given when a round is over.

       When food starts blinking, it's about to rot. Rotten food is poisonous, and thus uneatable. As long as it
       blinks, it can still be eaten.

       Oh, yes - I almost forgot: You may be visited by the evil headbanger.  Take my advice and run  away  from
       him before he hits you in the head!  He won't stay long.

       The keys used to control the game are given at startup.

       <b>snake4</b>  features  a  site-wide  highscore file. The file contains the top 200 users. Each user may appear
       once only in the highscore table.

       For technical reasons, <b>snake4</b> connects to the X11 server before parsing options. This makes it impossible
       to eg. browse the highscore table using -H if no server is available.  To be able to see  the  scores  in
       such  a  case,  <b>snake4scores</b>  produces  the  same output as <b>snake4</b> with option -H, but does no attempt on
       connecting to the X11 server.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <u>-h,</u> <u>--help</u>
              Print a usage message on standard output, and exit successfully.

       <u>-H,</u> <u>--highscores</u>
              Dump the highscore list to standard output, and exit successfully.  Starting <b>snake4</b> with the  name
              <b>snake4score</b>  does the same thing, without first connecting to the X11 server.  Note that this will
              possibly print more entries than the 20 or so that will fit within the game startup screen.

       <u>-V,</u> <u>--version</u>
              Print version information on standard output, then exit successfully.

       <u>-M,</u> <u>--merge-highscores=file</u>
              Merge separate highscore file <u>file</u>  into  the  default  highscore  file,  and  exit  successfully.
              Displays the new highscore table. This option is for the game owner or root only.

</pre><h4><b>X11</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the above mentioned options, <b>snake4</b> accepts the standard X11 toolkit options.
