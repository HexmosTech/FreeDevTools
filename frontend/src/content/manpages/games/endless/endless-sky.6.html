</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       endless-sky - a space exploration and combat game.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>endless-sky</b>   [-h]  [--help]  [-v]  [--version]  [-s]  [--ships]  [-w]  [--weapons]  [-t]  [--talk]  [-r]
       [--resources] [-c] [--config] [-p] [--parse-save] [--test]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Endless</b> <b>Sky</b> is a space exploration and combat game combining action and role playing elements.

       Explore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use  your
       earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates.
       Take  sides  in  a  civil  war.  Or  leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose
       culture is more civilized than your own.

       For keyboard controls, click the "Preferences" button on the title screen. You can pause  and  return  to
       the title screen at any point in the game by pressing &lt;escape&gt;.

       Most  of  the  controls should be self-explanatory. Your ship has no reverse thrusters, so as with a real
       spacecraft, the only way to slow down is to  turn  your  ship  around  and  accelerate  in  the  opposite
       direction  from  your  current  heading. To assist with some tricky maneuvers, your ship has an autopilot
       which engages when you press 'L' to land or 'J' to enter hyperspace;  the  autopilot  disengages  if  you
       press  any  of the movement keys. The autopilot will also automatically aim your ship if you are firing a
       weapon and have a target selected.

       When run from the command line, if a resource directory is not specified, the program will check  to  see
       if  the  current  directory contains directories named "data" and "images" and files named "keys.txt" and
       "credits.txt"; if so  it  will  read  resources  from  the  current  directory.  Otherwise  it  will  use
       /usr/local/share/games/endless-sky if it exists, or /usr/share/games/endless-sky/ otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              prints a short help message.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              prints the software version.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--talk</b>
              reads  a  data  file  from  STDIN  and looks for a "conversation" node at the root level (i.e. not
              indentated). If it finds one, that conversation is displayed in  a  pop-up  dialog.  This  is  for
              testing conversations in a new mission you are developing.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--resources</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              sets the directory from which game resources (images, etc.) will be loaded.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--config</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              sets the directory where preferences and saved games will be stored.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--parse-save</b>
              prints  any  content  or  whitespace-formatting errors found while loading data files and the most
              recent saved game. This option prevents the game from launching.

       <b>--parse-assets</b>
              prints any content, whitespace-formatting, image, or sound errors found while loading data, image,
              and sound files and the most recent saved game. This option prevents the game from launching.

       <b>--test</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              execute the test case with the given name. By default, the game will be muted while running tests.

       <b>--tests</b>
              prints (to STDOUT) a list of available tests, usable for automatic test runs. This option prevents
              the game from launching.

              prevents muting the game when running tests.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--ships</b>
              prints (to STDOUT) a table of ship  stats  (just  the  base  stats,  not  considering  any  stored
              outfits). This option prevents the game from launching.

              prints  (to  STDOUT) a table of characteristics of all the available weapons. This option prevents
              the game from launching.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--engines</b>
              prints (to STDOUT) a table of characteristics of all the available engines. This  option  prevents
              the game from launching.
