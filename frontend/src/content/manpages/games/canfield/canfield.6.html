</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       canfield, cfscores — the solitaire card game canfield

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>canfield</b>
       <b>cfscores</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<u>user</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  have  never  played solitaire before, it is recommended that you consult a solitaire instruction
       book. In Canfield, tableau cards may be built on each other downward in alternate colors. An entire  pile
       must  be  moved  as a unit in building. Top cards of the piles are available to be played on foundations,
       but never into empty spaces.

       Spaces must be filled from the stock. The top card of the  stock  also  is  available  to  be  played  on
       foundations  or  built  on tableau piles. After the stock is exhausted, tableau spaces may be filled from
       the talon and the player may keep them open until he wishes to use them.

       Cards are dealt from the hand to the talon by threes and this repeats until there are no  more  cards  in
       the  hand  or  the  player quits.  To have cards dealt onto the talon the player types ‘<b>ht</b>’ for his move.
       Foundation base cards are also automatically moved to the foundation when they become available.

       The command ‘<b>c</b>’ causes <b>canfield</b> to maintain card counting statistics on the bottom of the  screen.   When
       properly used this can greatly increase one's chances of winning.

       The  rules for betting are somewhat less strict than those used in the official version of the game.  The
       initial deal costs $13.  You may quit at this point or inspect the game.  Inspection costs $13 and allows
       you to make as many moves as possible without moving any cards from your hand to the talon.  (The initial
       deal places three cards on the talon; if all these cards  are  used,  three  more  are  made  available.)
       Finally, if the game seems interesting, you must pay the final installment of $26.  At this point you are
       credited  at the rate of $5 for each card on the foundation; as the game progresses you are credited with
       $5 for each card that is moved to the foundation.  Each run through the hand after the  first  costs  $5.
       The  card  counting  feature  costs  $1  for each unknown card that is identified.  If the information is
       toggled on, you are only charged for cards that became visible since it was last  turned  on.   Thus  the
       maximum cost of information is $34.  Playing time is charged at a rate of $1 per minute.

       With  no  arguments,  the  program <b>cfscores</b> prints out the current status of your canfield account.  If a
       <u>user</u> name is specified, it prints out the status of their canfield account.  If the <b>-a</b> flag is specified,
       it prints out the canfield accounts for all users that have played the game since the  database  was  set
       up.
