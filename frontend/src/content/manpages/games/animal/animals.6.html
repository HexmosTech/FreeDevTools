</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       animals - traditional AI game that learns about animals from the player

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>animals</b> [DatabaseFile [TypeString [PluralTypeString]]]

       or

       <b>animals</b> {-h|--help}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>animals</b> game.  <b>animals</b> is a text-based animal guessing game.

</pre><h4><b>RULES</b></h4><pre>
       You think of an animal, and hit enter when you have one.  Then the game asks you yes-or-no questions that
       successively  narrows  down  your  animal.  Eventually, the game will make a guess, and ask you if it was
       right. If it was wrong, you win! You then teach it about your animal.

       native version was released.  This was part of the takeover by  Philipp  Schafft  (see  AUTHORS)  of  the
       Debian  as  it  was  orphaned.  On  Wed, 27th of Jun 2012 he abdicated Debian maintainership but is still
       upstream author.
