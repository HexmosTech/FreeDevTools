</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       FIGlet - display large characters made up of ordinary screen characters

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>figlet</b> [ <b>-cklnoprstvxDELNRSWX</b> ] [ <b>-d</b> <u>fontdirectory</u> ]
              [ <b>-f</b> <u>fontfile</u> ] [ <b>-m</b> <u>layoutmode</u> ]
              [ <b>-w</b> <u>outputwidth</u> ] [ <b>-C</b> <u>controlfile</u> ]
              [ <b>-I</b> <u>infocode</u> ] [ <u>message</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FIGlet</b>  prints  its  input  using  large  characters (called ``FIGcharacters'')made up of ordinary screen
       characters  (called  ``sub-characters'').   <b>FIGlet</b>  output  is  generally  reminiscent  of  the  sort  of
       ``signatures''  many people like to put at the end of e-mail and UseNet messages.  It is also reminiscent
       of the output of some banner programs, although it is oriented normally, not sideways.

       <b>FIGlet</b> can print in a variety of fonts, both left-to-right and right-to-left, with adjacent FIGcharacters
       kerned and ``smushed'' together in various ways.  <b>FIGlet</b> fonts are stored in separate files, which can be
       identified by the suffix ``<b>.flf</b>''.  In systems with UTF-8 support <b>FIGlet</b> may also support TOIlet ``<b>.tlf</b>''
       fonts.  Most <b>FIGlet</b> font files will be stored in <b>FIGlet's</b> default font directory.

       <b>FIGlet</b> can also use ``control files'', which tell it to map certain input  characters  to  certain  other
       characters,  similar  to  the  Unix  <b>tr</b> command.  Control files can be identified by the suffix ``<b>.flc</b>''.
       Most <b>FIGlet</b> control files will be stored in <b>FIGlet's</b> default font directory.

       You can store <b>FIGlet</b> fonts and control files in compressed form.  See <b>COMPRESSED</b> <b>FONTS</b>.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Just start up <b>FIGlet</b> (type ``<b>figlet</b>'') and then type whatever you want.  Alternatively, pipe  a  file  or
       the  output  of  another command through <b>FIGlet</b>, or put input on the command line after the options.  See
       <b>EXAMPLES</b> for other things to do.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FIGlet</b> reads command line options from left to right, and only the last option that affects  a  parameter
       has any effect.  Almost every option has an inverse, so that, for example, if <b>FIGlet</b> is customized with a
       shell <b>alias</b>, all the options are usually still available.

       Commonly-used options are <b>-f</b>, <b>-c</b>, <b>-k</b>, <b>-t</b>, <b>-p</b> and <b>-v</b>.

       <b>-f</b> <u>fontfile</u>
              Select  the font.  The <b>.flf</b> suffix may be left off of <u>fontfile</u>, in which case <b>FIGlet</b> automatically
              appends it.  <b>FIGlet</b> looks for the file first in the default font directory and then in the current
              directory, or, if <u>fontfile</u> was given as a full pathname, in the given directory.  If the <b>-f</b> option
              is not specified, <b>FIGlet</b> uses the font that was specified when it was compiled.  To find out which
              font this is, use the <b>-I3</b> option.

       <b>-d</b> <u>fontdirectory</u>
              Change the default font directory.  <b>FIGlet</b> looks for fonts first in the default directory and then
              in the current directory.  If the <b>-d</b> option is not specified, <b>FIGlet</b> uses the directory  that  was
              specified when it was compiled.  To find out which directory this is, use the <b>-I2</b> option.

       <b>-c</b>
       <b>-l</b>
       <b>-r</b>
       <b>-x</b>     These  options handle the justification of <b>FIGlet</b> output.  <b>-c</b> centers the output horizontally.  <b>-l</b>
              makes the output flush-left.  <b>-r</b> makes  it  flush-right.   <b>-x</b>  (default)  sets  the  justification
              according  to whether left-to-right or right-to-left text is selected.  Left-to-right text will be
              flush-left, while right-to-left text will be  flush-right.   (Left-to-right  versus  right-to-left
              text is controlled by <b>-L</b>, <b>-R</b> and <b>-X</b>.)

       <b>-t</b>
       <b>-w</b> <u>outputwidth</u>
              These  options  control  the  <u>outputwidth</u>,  or the screen width <b>FIGlet</b> assumes when formatting its
              output.  <b>FIGlet</b> uses the <u>outputwidth</u> to determine when to  break  lines  and  how  to  center  the
              output.   Normally,  <b>FIGlet</b>  assumes 80 columns so that people with wide terminals won't annoy the
              people they e-mail <b>FIGlet</b> output to.  <b>-t</b> sets the <u>outputwidth</u>  to  the  terminal  width.   If  the
              terminal  width  cannot  be  determined,  the  previous  <u>outputwidth</u>  is  retained.   <b>-w</b>  sets the
              <u>outputwidth</u> to the given integer.  An <u>outputwidth</u> of 1 is a special value  that  tells  <b>FIGlet</b>  to
              print each non-space FIGcharacter, in its entirety, on a separate line, no matter how wide it is.

       <b>-p</b>
       <b>-n</b>     These  options control how <b>FIGlet</b> handles newlines.  <b>-p</b> puts <b>FIGlet</b> into ``paragraph mode'', which
              eliminates some unnecessary line  breaks  when  piping  a  multi-line  file  through  <b>FIGlet</b>.   In
              paragraph mode, <b>FIGlet</b> treats line breaks within a paragraph as if they were merely blanks between
              words.   (Specifically, <b>-p</b> causes <b>FIGlet</b> to convert any newline which is not preceded by a newline
              and not followed by a space character into a blank.)  <b>-n</b> (default) puts <b>FIGlet</b> back to normal,  in
              which every newline <b>FIGlet</b> reads causes it to produce a line break.

       <b>-D</b>
       <b>-E</b>     <b>-D</b>  switches  to the German (ISO 646-DE) character set.  Turns `[', `\' and `]' into umlauted A, O
              and U, respectively.  `{', `|' and `}' turn into the respective lower case versions of these.  `~'
              turns into s-z.  <b>-E</b> turns off <b>-D</b> processing.  These  options  are  deprecated,  which  means  they
              probably will not appear in the next version of <b>FIGlet</b>.

       <b>-C</b> <u>controlfile</u>
       <b>-N</b>     These  options  deal  with  <b>FIGlet</b>  <u>controlfiles</u>.   A  <u>controlfile</u>  is a file containing a list of
              commands that <b>FIGlet</b> executes each time it reads a character.   These  commands  can  map  certain
              input  characters  to  other  characters,  similar to the Unix <b>tr</b> command or the <b>FIGlet</b> <b>-D</b> option.
              <b>FIGlet</b> maintains a list of <u>controlfiles</u>, which is empty when <b>FIGlet</b> starts up.  <b>-C</b> adds the  given
              <u>controlfile</u>  to  the  list.  <b>-N</b> clears the <u>controlfile</u> list, cancelling the effect of any previous
              <b>-C</b>.  <b>FIGlet</b> executes the commands in all <u>controlfiles</u> in the  list.   See  the  file  <u>figfont.txt</u>,
              provided with FIGlet, for details on how to write a <u>controlfile</u>.

       <b>-s</b>
       <b>-S</b>
       <b>-k</b>
       <b>-W</b>

       <b>-o</b>     These  options  control  how <b>FIGlet</b> spaces the FIGcharacters that it outputs.  <b>-s</b> (default) and <b>-S</b>
              cause  ``smushing''.   The  FIGcharacters  are  displayed  as  close  together  as  possible,  and
              overlapping  sub-characters  are  removed.   Exactly which sub-characters count as ``overlapping''
              depends on the font's <u>layoutmode</u>, which is defined by the font's author.  <b>-k</b>  causes  ``kerning''.
              As  many  blanks  as  possible  are  removed  between  FIGcharacters,  so that they touch, but the
              FIGcharacters are not smushed.  <b>-W</b> makes <b>FIGlet</b> display all FIGcharacters  at  their  full  width,
              which may be fixed or variable, depending on the font.

              The  difference  between <b>-s</b> and <b>-S</b> is that <b>-s</b> will not smush a font whose author specified kerning
              or full width as the default <u>layoutmode</u>, whereas <b>-S</b> will attempt to do so.

              If there is no information in the font about how to smush, or if the <b>-o</b> option is specified,  then
              the  FIGcharacters  are  ``overlapped''.  This means that after kerning, the first subcharacter of
              each  FIGcharacter  is  removed.   (This  is  not  done  if  a  FIGcharacter  contains  only   one
              subcharacter.)

       <b>-m</b> <u>layoutmode</u>
              Specifies an explicit <u>layoutmode</u> between <b>1</b> and <b>63</b>.  <u>Smushmodes</u> are explained in <u>figfont.txt</u>, which
              also  provides  complete  information  on  the  format of a <b>FIGlet</b> font.  For the sake of backward
              compatibility with versions of <b>FIGlet</b> before 2.2, <b>-m0</b> is equivalent to <b>-k</b>, <b>-m-1</b> is  equivalent  to
              <b>-W</b>,  and  <b>-m-2</b> is equivalent to <b>-s</b>.  The <b>-m</b> switch is normally used only by font designers testing
              the various <u>layoutmodes</u> with a new font.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>-I</b> <u>infocode</u>
              These options print various information about <b>FIGlet</b>, then exit.  If several of these options  are
              given  on  the  command  line,  only  the  last is executed, and only after all other command-line
              options have been dealt with.

              <b>-v</b> prints version and copyright information, as well as a ``Usage: ...''   line.   <b>-I</b>  prints  the
              information  corresponding to the given <u>infocode</u> in a consistent, reliable (i.e., guaranteed to be
              the same in future releases) format.  <b>-I</b> is primarily intended to be used  by  programs  that  use
              <b>FIGlet</b>.  <u>infocode</u> can be any of the following.

              <b>-1</b> Normal operation (default).
                     This  <u>infocode</u>  indicates that <b>FIGlet</b> should operate normally, not giving any informational
                     printout, printing its input in the selected font.

              <b>0</b> Version and copyright.
                     This is identical to <b>-v</b>.

              <b>1</b> Version (integer).
                     This will print the version of your copy of <b>FIGlet</b> as a decimal integer.  The main  version
                     number  is  multiplied  by 10000, the sub-version number is multiplied by 100, and the sub-
                     sub-version number is multiplied by 1.  These are added together, and the result is printed
                     out.  For example, <b>FIGlet</b> 2.2 will print ``<b>20200</b>'' , version 2.2.1  will  print  ``<b>20201</b>''.
                     Similarly,  version  3.7.2  would  print  ``<b>30702</b>''.   These  numbers  are guaranteed to be
                     ascending, with later versions having higher numbers.  Note that the first major release of
                     <b>FIGlet</b>, version 2.0, did not have the <b>-I</b> option.

              <b>2</b> Default font directory.
                     This will print the default font directory.  It is affected by the <b>-d</b> option.

              <b>3</b> Font.
                     This will print the name of the font <b>FIGlet</b> would use.  It is affected by  the  <b>-f</b>  option.
                     This is not a filename; the ``<b>.flf</b>'' suffix is not printed.

              <b>4</b> Output width.
                     This  will  print  the  value  <b>FIGlet</b> would use for <u>outputwidth</u>, the number of columns wide
                     <b>FIGlet</b> assumes the screen is.  It is affected by the <b>-w</b> and <b>-t</b> options.

              <b>5</b> Supported font formats.
                     This will list font formats supported by  <b>FIGlet</b>  <b>.</b>   Possible  formats  are  ``<b>flf2</b>''  for
                     FIGfont Version 2 <b>.flf</b> files and ``<b>tlf2</b>'' for TOIlet <b>.tlf</b> files.

              If <u>infocode</u> is any other positive value, <b>FIGlet</b> will simply exit without printing anything.

       <b>-L</b>
       <b>-R</b>
       <b>-X</b>     These  options  control whether <b>FIGlet</b> prints left-to-right or right-to-left.  <b>-L</b> selects left-to-
              right printing.  <b>-R</b> selects right-to-left printing.  <b>-X</b> (default) makes <b>FIGlet</b>  use  whichever  is
              specified in the font file.

              Once  the  options  are  read, if there are any remaining words on the command line, they are used
              instead of standard input as the source of text.  This feature allows shell  scripts  to  generate
              large letters without having to dummy up standard input files.

              An empty argument, obtained by two sequential quotes, results in a line break.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To use <b>FIGlet</b> with its default settings, simply type

              <b>example%</b> <b>figlet</b>

       and then type whatever you like.

       To change the font, use the <b>-f</b> option, for example,

              <b>example%</b> <b>figlet</b> <b>-f</b> <b>script</b>

       Use the <b>-c</b> option if you would prefer centered output:

              <b>example%</b> <b>figlet</b> <b>-c</b>

       We have found that the most common use of <b>FIGlet</b> is making up large text to be placed in e-mail messages.
       For  this reason, <b>FIGlet</b> defaults to 80 column output.  If you are using a wider terminal, and would like
       <b>FIGlet</b> to use the full width of your terminal, use the <b>-t</b> option:

              <b>example%</b> <b>figlet</b> <b>-t</b>

       If you don't want <b>FIGlet</b> to smush FIGcharacters into each other, use the <b>-k</b> option:

              <b>example%</b> <b>figlet</b> <b>-k</b>

       If <b>figlet</b> gets its input from a file, it is often a good idea to use <b>-p</b>:

              <b>example%</b> <b>figlet</b> <b>-p</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>myfile</b>

       Of course, the above can be combined:

              <b>example%</b> <b>figlet</b> <b>-ptk</b> <b>-f</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>anotherfile</b>
              <b>example%</b> <b>figlet</b> <b>-cf</b> <b>slant</b>

       Finally, if you want to have <b>FIGlet</b> take the input from the command line instead of a file:

              <b>example%</b> <b>figlet</b> <b>Hello</b> <b>world</b>

   <b>Other</b> <b>Things</b> <b>to</b> <b>Try</b>
       On many systems nice effects can be obtained from the <b>lean</b> font by piping it through <b>tr</b>.  Some you  might
       want to try are the following:

              <b>example%</b> <b>figlet</b> <b>-f</b> <b>lean</b> <b>|</b> <b>tr</b> <b>'</b> <b>_/'</b> <b>'</b> <b>()'</b>
              <b>example%</b> <b>figlet</b> <b>-f</b> <b>lean</b> <b>|</b> <b>tr</b> <b>'</b> <b>_/'</b> <b>'./\\'</b>
              <b>example%</b> <b>figlet</b> <b>-f</b> <b>lean</b> <b>|</b> <b>tr</b> <b>'</b> <b>_/'</b> <b>'</b> <b>//'</b>
              <b>example%</b> <b>figlet</b> <b>-f</b> <b>lean</b> <b>|</b> <b>tr</b> <b>'</b> <b>_/'</b> <b>'/</b>  <b>'</b>

       Similar things can be done with the <b>block</b> font and many of the other <b>FIGlet</b> fonts.

</pre><h4><b>COMPRESSED</b> <b>FONTS</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  compress  the  fonts  and controlfiles using the <b>zip</b> archiving program.  Place only one font or
       controlfile in each archive, and rename the archive file (which will have a name ending in <b>.zip</b>) back  to
       <b>.flf</b>  or  <b>.flc</b>  as  the case may be.  If you don't rename the file appropriately, <b>FIGlet</b> won't be able to
       find it.

       <b>FIGlet</b> does not care what the filename within the <b>.zip</b> archive is, and will process only the first file.

       The <b>.zip</b> format was chosen because tools to create and manipulate it are widely  available  for  free  on
       many platforms.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>STANDARD</b> <b>FONTS</b></h4><pre>
       Here  are a few notes about some of the fonts provided with <u>FIGlet</u>.  You can get many other font from the
       Web site
       <a href="http://www.figlet.org/">http://www.figlet.org/</a>   This location should also contain the latest version of <b>FIGlet</b> and other related
       utilities.

       The font <u>standard</u> is the basic <b>FIGlet</b> font, used when no other font is specified.  (This default  can  be
       changed when <b>FIGlet</b> is compiled on your system.)  The <u>controlfiles</u> <u>8859-2</u>, <u>8859-3</u>, <u>8859-4</u>, and <u>8859-9</u> are
       provided  for  interpreting those character sets, also known as ISO Latin-2 through Latin-5 respectively.
       The character set 8859-1 (ISO Latin-1) is <b>FIGlet's</b> default and requires no special <u>controlfile</u>.

       Closely related are the fonts <u>slant</u>, <u>shadow</u>, <u>small</u>, <u>smslant</u> (both small  and  slanted),  <u>smshadow</u>,  (both
       small  and  shadowed),  and  <u>big</u>.   These  fonts  support  only  Latin-1,  except that <u>big</u> supports Greek
       FIGcharacters as well; the <u>controlfiles</u> <u>frango</u> (for Greek text written  in  Latin  characters,  so-called
       ``<u>frangovlakhika</u>''), and <u>8859-7</u> (for mixed Latin/Greek text) are provided.

       The  <u>ivrit</u>  font  is  a  right-to-left  font  including  both  Latin  and Hebrew FIGcharacters; the Latin
       characters are those of the <u>standard</u> font.  The available  <u>controlfiles</u>  are  <u>ilhebrew</u>,  which  maps  the
       letters  you  get  by  typing on a U.S. keyboard as if it were a Hebrew keyboard; <u>ushebrew</u>, which makes a
       reasonable mapping from Latin letters to Hebrew ones; and <u>8859-8</u>, which supports mixed Latin/Hebrew text.
       <b>Warning:</b> <b>FIGlet</b> doesn't support bidirectional text, so everything will come out right-to-left, even Latin
       letters.

       The fonts <u>terminal</u>, <u>digital</u>, and <u>bubble</u> output the input character with some decoration around it (or  no
       decoration,   in  the  case  of  <u>terminal</u>).   The  characters  coded  128  to  159,  which  have  varying
       interpretations, are output as-is.  You can use the appropriate <u>controlfiles</u> to process Latin-2, Latin-3,
       or Latin-4 (but not Latin-5) text, provided your output device has  screen  or  printer  fonts  that  are
       appropriate for these character sets.

       Two script fonts are available: <u>script</u>, which is larger than <u>standard</u>, and <u>smscript</u>, which is smaller.

       The  font <u>lean</u> is made up solely of `/' and `_' sub-characters; <u>block</u> is a straight (non-leaning) version
       of it.

       The font <u>mini</u> is very small, and especially suitable for e-mail signatures.

       The font <u>banner</u> looks like the output of the <b>banner</b> program; it is a capitals  and  small  capitals  font
       that  doesn't  support the ISO Latin-1 extensions to plain ASCII.  It does, however, support the Japanese
       <u>katakana</u> syllabary; the <u>controlfile</u> <u>uskata</u> maps the upper-case and lower-case Latin letters into  the  48
       basic  <u>katakana</u>  characters,  and  the  <u>controlfile</u> <u>jis0201</u> handles JIS 0201X (JIS-Roman) mixed Latin and
       <u>katakana</u> text.  Furthermore,  the  <u>banner</u>  font  also  supports  Cyrillic  (Russian)  FIGcharacters;  the
       <u>controlfile</u>  <u>8859-5</u>  supports  mixed  Latin and Cyrillic text, the <u>controlfile</u> <u>koi8r</u> supports the popular
       KOI8-R mapping of mixed text, and the <u>controlfile</u> <u>moscow</u>  supports  a  sensible  mapping  from  Latin  to
       Cyrillic, compatible with the <u>moscow</u> font (not supplied).

       The  fonts  <u>mnemonic</u>  and  <u>safemnem</u>  support  the  mnemonic  character  set documented in RFC 1345.  They
       implement a large subset of Unicode (over 1800  characters)  very  crudely,  using  ASCII-based  mnemonic
       sequences, and are good for getting a quick look at UTF-8 unicode files, using the controlfile <u>utf8</u>.

              If $<b>FIGLET_FONTDIR</b> is set, its value is used as a path to search for font files.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>file</u><b>.flf</b>            <b>FIGlet</b> font file
       <u>file</u><b>.flc</b>            <b>FIGlet</b> control file

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FIGlet's</b> diagnostics are intended to be self-explanatory.  Possible messages are

              <b>Usage:</b> <b>...</b>
              <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b>
              <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>font</b> <b>file</b>
              <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>FIGlet</b> <b>2</b> <b>font</b> <b>file</b>
              <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>control</b> <b>file</b>
              <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>FIGlet</b> <b>2</b> <b>control</b> <b>file</b>
              <b>"-t"</b> <b>is</b> <b>disabled,</b> <b>since</b> <b>ioctl</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> <b>implemented.</b>

       This  last  message  is  printed  when  the  <b>-t</b> option is given, but the operating system in use does not
       include the system call <b>FIGlet</b> uses to determine the terminal width.

       <b>FIGlet</b> also prints an explanatory message if the <b>-F</b> option is given on the  command  line.   The  earlier
       version of <b>FIGlet</b>, version 2.0, listed the available fonts when the <b>-F</b> option was given.  This option has
       been  removed from <b>FIGlet</b> 2.1.  It has been replaced by the <b>figlist</b> script, which is part of the standard
       <b>FIGlet</b> package.

</pre><h4><b>ORIGIN</b></h4><pre>
       ``<b>FIGlet</b>'' stands for ``Frank, Ian and Glenn's LETters''.  Inspired by Frank's .sig,  Glenn  wrote  (most
       of) it, and Ian helped.

       Most  of  the  standard  <b>FIGlet</b>  fonts  were  inspired  by  signatures on various UseNet articles.  Since
       typically hundreds of people use the same style of letters in their signatures, it was often  not  deemed
       necessary to give credit to any one font designer.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Very  little  error  checking  is  done on font and control files.  While <b>FIGlet</b> tries to be forgiving of
       errors, and should (hopefully) never actually crash, using an improperly-formatted file with <b>FIGlet</b>  will
       produce unpredictable output.

       <b>FIGlet</b>  does  not  handle format characters in a very intelligent way.  A tab character is converted to a
       blank, and vertical-tab, form-feed and carriage-return are each converted to a newline.  On many systems,
       tabs can be handled better by piping files through <b>expand</b> before piping through <b>FIGlet</b>.

       <b>FIGlet</b> output is quite ugly if it is displayed in a proportionally-spaced font.  I suppose this is to  be
       expected.

       Please report any errors you find in this man page or the program to &lt;<a href="mailto:info@figlet.org">info@figlet.org</a>&gt;

</pre><h4><b>WEBSITE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>MAILING</b> <b>LIST</b></h4><pre>
       You can get many fonts which are not in the basic <b>FIGlet</b> package from the Web site <a href="http://www.figlet.org/">http://www.figlet.org/</a>
       It should also contain the latest version of <b>FIGlet</b> and other utilities related to <b>FIGlet</b>.

       There  is  a  mailing  list for <b>FIGlet</b> for general discussions about <b>FIGlet</b> and a place where you can ask
       questions or share ideas with other <b>FIGlet</b> users. It is also the place where we will publish  news  about
       new fonts, new software updates etc.

       To   subscribe   or   unsubscribe   from   the   <b>FIGlet</b>  mailing  list,  please  send  email  to  figlet-
       <a href="mailto:subscribe@figlet.org">subscribe@figlet.org</a>   or   <a href="mailto:figlet-unsubscribe@figlet.org">figlet-unsubscribe@figlet.org</a>   or   visit   the    following    web    page:

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       Glenn  Chappell  did most of the work.  You can e-mail him but he is not an e-mail fanatic; people who e-
       mail Glenn will probably get answers, but if you e-mail his best friend:

       Ian Chai, who <u>is</u> an e-mail fanatic, you'll get answers, endless conversation about the mysteries of life,
       invitations to join some 473 mailing lists and a free toaster.  (Well, ok, maybe not the free toaster.)

       Frank inspired this whole project with his .sig, but don't  e-mail  him;  he's  decidedly  an  un-e-mail-
       fanatic.

       Gilbert  "The Mad Programmer" Healton added the <b>-A</b> option for version 2.1.1.  This option specified input
       from the command line; it is still allowed, but has no effect.

       John Cowan added the <b>-o</b>, <b>-s</b>, <b>-k</b>, <b>-S</b>, and <b>-W</b> options, and the support  for  Unicode  mapping  tables,  ISO
       2022/HZ/Shift-JIS/UTF-8   input,   and  compressed  fonts  and  control  files.   He  also  revised  this
       documentation, with a lot of input from Paul Burton.

       Claudio Matsuoka added the support for <b>.tlf</b> files  for  version  2.2.4  and  performs  random  hacks  and
       bugfixes.

       As  a  fan of FIGlet, Christiaan Keet revised the official FIGlet documentation and set up the new FIGlet
       website at <a href="http://www.figlet.org/">http://www.figlet.org/</a> (and the corresponding <a href="ftp://ftp.figlet.org/pub/figlet/">ftp://ftp.figlet.org/pub/figlet/</a>)
