</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       GemRB - a reimplementation of the Infinity Engine

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gemrb</b> [-q] [-c <u>CONFIG-FILE</u>]
       <b>gemrb</b> <u>PATH-TO-GAME</u>
       <b>torment</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>GemRB</b>  a  portable  open-source  implementation  of  Biowareâ€™s Infinity Engine, which runs fine RPGs like
       Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment.

       <b>GemRB</b> reimplements only the game engine. To actually play anything, you have to have the  data  from  the
       original  game(s), installed or unpackaged where GemRB can find it.  See the <u>GamePath</u> and <u>CDn</u> settings in
       the engine configuration file below. A full install is recommended.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-q</b>     Disable audio completely, regardless of supported audio plugins.

       <b>-f</b>     Start in full screen. Try this if the game window suffers from bad aspect  ratio.  Otherwise  just
              switch to your preference in the game's video options.

       <b>-c</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Use the specified configuration file <u>FILE</u> instead of the default <u>gemrb.cfg</u>.

       <b>--color</b><u>OPTION</u>
              Set the ANSI color option for terminal logging. -1 (the default) will attempt to automatically set
              this  according  to  the  terminal  environment. 0 will disable color output, 1 will set it to the
              basic 8 color palette, and 2 will use full 24bit color codes.

              <b>Note:</b> You can also use the program's name as  a  mean  to  select  the  configuration  file.   For
              example,  if  the  program's  name  is  <u>torment</u>  instead  of  <u>gemrb</u>, the engine first searches for
              <u>torment.cfg</u> and only if it's not found it searches for <u>gemrb.cfg</u>.

              To use this feature, just create a symbolic link <u>torment</u> pointing to the <u>gemrb</u> binary and then run
              <u>torment</u> instead.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       A configuration file consists of pairs <u>PARAMETER=VALUE</u>, each on its own line. The case  of  PARAMETER  is
       not  significant, GameType is the same as GAMETYPE. If the same PARAMETER is defined more than once, only
       the last occurrence is used.

       Empty lines and lines starting with `#' (hash sign) are ignored.

       At least the <u>GamePath</u> parameter needs to be changed. That is often enough, so  do  not  fiddle  with  the
       other paths too much.

</pre><h4><b>General</b> <b>Parameters:</b></h4><pre>
       <b>GameType</b>=(auto|bg1|bg2|iwd|iwd2|how|pst)
              Type  of  the  game.  The value is a name of subdirectory in override/ and GUIScripts/ directories
              with game type-specific files and scripts. It is at present also used for various tweaks hardcoded
              in the GemRB engine. To autodetect the game type, use the default "auto".

       <b>GameName</b>=STRING
              Arbitrary name of the game. It will be displayed in the window's title bar.

       <b>Encoding</b>=(default|japanese|korean|chinese)
              Specify language used in the game data.

       <b>GUIEnhancements</b>=INT
              The value is a bitfield. Set it to 1 to enable a few GUI enhancements, mostly in BG2.  Add or  set
              to 2 to try to autoidentify items on transfer (if the character has enough lore).  Add or set 4 if
              you want to skip the item description window when opening bags.  Add or set 16 if you want scrolls
              for spells the pc does not know yet highlighted.  Enabled by default. Add or set 8 if you want the
              game to stop mouse scrolling the area at its edges when the window loses focus.

       <b>MultipleQuickSaves</b>=(0|1)
              EXPERIMENTAL.  Set  this  to  1  if you want GemRB to keep multiple quicksaves around. Disabled by
              default.

       <b>MaxPartySize</b>=INT
              Set this to 1-10 if you want more party members or enforce fewer. 6 by default.  <b>NOTE:</b> For  bigger
              parties you need to choose a big enough resolution, so there will be enough room for all the party
              portraits! No space for that in PST or IWD2. The 10pp mod is required to fix various game scripts,
              so the extra party members don't get stuck in cutscenes.

       <b>Logging</b>=(0|1)
              By  default  (set to 1) logging is enabled and several loggers are used depending on the plaftorm.
              Use 0 to disable all logging, which can help in performance critical settings.

</pre><h4><b>Video</b> <b>Parameters:</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Width</b>=INT
              Game window width (in pixels).  This can be arbitrary, but results depend on the game data.  Check
              the website for a detailed explanation of resolution modes.

       <b>Height</b>=INT
              Game window height (in pixels).

       <b>Bpp</b>=INT
              Color depth of the game window (in bits per pixel).

       <b>ScaleQuality</b>=(best|linear|nearest)
              Use the specified quality for the texture scaling filter. The default is <u>best</u>.

       <b>CapFPS</b>=(-1|0|n)
              Set FPS handling:
                -1: no limit
                 0: VSync (SDL2), 30 (SDL1)
                 n: cap to n FPS

       <b>SkipIntroVideos</b>=(0|1)
              If set to <u>1</u>, the intro and logo videos are skipped to save developer's nerves. The default is <u>0</u>.

       <b>GCDebug</b>=(0|2047)
              Bitfield with reserved bits for drawing Map debug layers.
                No Debugging features = 0 (default)
                DEBUG_SHOW_INFOPOINTS         = 1
                DEBUG_SHOW_CONTAINERS         = 2
                DEBUG_SHOW_DOORS                   = 4
                DEBUG_SHOW_DOORS_SECRET       = 8
                DEBUG_SHOW_DOORS_DISABLED          = 16
                DEBUG_SHOW_DOORS_ALL               = 28
                DEBUG_SHOW_LIGHTMAP           = 32
                DEBUG_SHOW_WALLS                   = 64
                DEBUG_SHOW_WALLS_ANIM_COVER   = 128
                DEBUG_SHOW_WALLS_ALL               = 192
                DEBUG_SHOW_SEARCHMAP               = 256
                DEBUG_SHOW_FOG_UNEXPLORED          = 512
                DEBUG_SHOW_FOG_INVISIBLE      = 1024
                DEBUG_SHOW_FOG_ALL            = 1536

</pre><h4><b>Audio</b> <b>Parameters:</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AudioDriver</b>=(openal|sdlaudio|none)
              Use the specified plugin as the audio driver. The default is openal, while <u>none</u> will  disable  all
              audio.

</pre><h4><b>Path</b> <b>parameters:</b></h4><pre>
       <b>CaseSensitive</b>=(0|1)
              When this parameter is set to <u>1</u>, the engine will try to find files regardless of their names' case
              at  the  cost of a slight speed penalty. This is especially important when using game files on CD-
              ROMs, where the files can't be renamed.  Like  many  Windows  programs,  the  original  games  use
              inconsistent mix of lower/upper case letters for naming and referencing their files.

              Set this parameter to <u>1</u> on Unix-like systems.

       <b>GamePath</b>=PATH
              Path to the directory where the original game is installed. If you can't install the game under MS
              Windows  or  with  WINE,  you  can try to unpack the data files with the <u>unshield</u> program found at
              <u><a href="http://synce.sourceforge.net">http://synce.sourceforge.net</a></u>.

       <b>CD1</b>=PATH
       <b>CD2</b>=PATH
       <b>CDn</b>=...
              Path to the data files for the game's particular CDs or any other data sources.

       <b>CachePath</b>=PATH
              User-writable directory where the engine caches uncompressed and temporary files.  Defaults  to  a
              subdirectory of the current directory.

       <b>GemRBPath</b>=PATH
              Path to the GemRB installation. (To be obsoleted; preset at build time).

       <b>GUIScriptsPath</b>=PATH
              Path  to  the directory with scripts controlling the game's GUI. (To be obsoleted; preset at build
              time).

       <b>GemRBOverridePath</b>=PATH
              Path where GemRB looks for its game override directory.  It defaults to <u>GemRBPath</u>.   GemRB  reuses
              some  of  the  unused  files  from the original or replaces them and this is the where they can be
              found. The path is preset at build time.  This directory has the highest priority when  searching,
              so  putting  files  in the game override will not affect them. Use another directory and add it as
              <u>ModPath</u> to the GemRB config.

       <b>GemRBUnhardcodedPath</b>=PATH
              Path where GemRB looks for its unhardcoded engine data.  It defaults to <u>GemRBPath</u>.   The  original
              games hardcoded this information in the engine.  The path is preset at build time.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>variables</u> <u>do</u> <u>not</u> <u>need</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>altered,</u> <u>unless</u> <u>you</u> <u>are</u> <u>doing</u> <u>something</u> <u>really</u> <u>special!</u>

       <b>SavePath</b>=PATH
              Path  to  the  directory  with  save  games.  Note that this directory has to contain <u>save/</u> and/or
              eventually <u>mpsave/</u> subdirectories and that only these  subdirectories  contain  the  actual  saved
              games.

              <u>SavePath</u> defaults to <u>GamePath</u>.

       <b>GameDataPath</b>=PATH
              Path to the original game's installed data files, relative to GamePath.  Usually it's <u>data</u>.

       <b>GameOverridePath</b>=PATH
              Path  to the original game's override dir, relative to GamePath.  Usually it's <u>override</u>.  Original
              games use this directory to place last-minute patches.

       <b>GameCharactersPath</b>=PATH
              Path to the original game's installed data files, relative to GamePath.  Usually it's <u>characters</u>.

       <b>GamePortraitsPath</b>=PATH
              Path to the original game's installed data files, relative to GamePath.  Usually it's <u>portraits</u>.

       <b>GameScriptsPath</b>=PATH
              Path to the original game's installed data files, relative to GamePath.  Usually it's <u>scripts</u>.

       <b>GameSoundsPath</b>=PATH
              Path to the original game's installed data files, relative to GamePath.  Usually it's <u>sounds</u>.

              <b>GameLanguagePath</b>=PATH Path to the original game's installed data files, relative to GamePath.   By
              default, it is <u>lang/en_US</u>.

       <b>GameMoviesPath</b>=PATH
              Path to the original game's installed data files, relative to GamePath.  Usually it's <u>movies</u>.

       <b>ModPath</b>=PATH
              Path  where  GemRB  looks  for  additional  engine override files.  It is not set by default. This
              directory has precedence over <u>GemRBOverridePath</u>.

       <b>CustomFontPath</b>=PATH
              Path where GemRB looks for additional font files. It is meant to be used with the TTF font  plugin
              and  fonts.2da  as  a  way  to specify where to look for system or other external fonts. Check the
              online documentation for the details.  It is not set by default.

</pre><h4><b>Input</b> <b>Parameters:</b></h4><pre>
