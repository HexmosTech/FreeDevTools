</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       stockfish - free UCI chess engine, to calculate chess moves

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>stockfish</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents the <b>stockfish</b> command.

       <b>stockfish</b> is an UCI chess engine, to calculate chess moves

       Stockfish  is  a free UCI chess engine derived from Glaurung 2.1. It is not a complete chess program, but
       requires some UCI compatible GUI (like XBoard with PolyGlot, eboard, Jose, Arena, in  order  to  be  used
       comfortably.   Read  the  documentation for your GUI of choice for information about how to use Stockfish
       with your GUI.

       This version of Stockfish supports up to 8 CPUs, but has not been tested thoroughly  with  more  than  2.
       The  program  tries  to  detect  the number of CPUs on your computer and set the number of search threads
       accordingly, but please be aware that the detection is not always correct.  It is  therefore  recommended
       to  inspect  the value of the "Threads" UCI parameter, and to make sure it equals the number of CPU cores
       on your computer. If you are using more than four threads, it  is  recommended  to  raise  the  value  of
       "Minimum Split Depth" UCI parameter to 6.

       Opening book

       This version of stockfish has experimental support for PolyGlot opening books.  For information about how
       to create such books, consult the PolyGlot documentation.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  does  NOT  follow  the  usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two
       dashes.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Communication  with   UCI   commands   is   documented   by   "The   UCI   Communication   Protocol"   in
       /usr/share/doc/stockfish/engine-interface.txt.
