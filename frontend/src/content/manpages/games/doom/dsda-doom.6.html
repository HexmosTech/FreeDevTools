</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dsda-doom - DSDA-Doom, a version of Doom for Unix, Linux and Windows systems

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dsda-doom</b> [options] [values|files]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>PrBoom</b>  is  a  version of the first-person shooter game Doom, originally released by iD software in 1993.
       It is based on Boom, a version of Doom adapted by TeamTNT (<a href="http://www.teamtnt.com/">http://www.teamtnt.com/</a>) for Dos. PrBoom  uses
       the SDL library, meaning it can run on a variety of different systems, including Windows and Unix/X11.

       <b>PrBoom+</b>  is  a  Doom source port developed from the original PrBoom project.  It adds uncapped framerate,
       variable gamespeed, re-record, walkcam, chasecam, full mouselook, FOV and other features without loss  of
       compatibility  with  original Doom.  <b>DSDA-Doom</b> is a fork of PrBoom+ with extra tooling for demo recording
       and playback, with a focus on speedrunning.

</pre><h4><b>GAME</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-complevel</b> <u>lvl</u>
              This sets the compatibility mode that  DSDA-Doom  runs  in.  If  you  need  to  change  this,  see
              <b>README.compat</b>.

       <b>-loadgame</b> { <u>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7</u> }
              Instructs DSDA-Doom to load the specified saved game immediately.

       <b>-warp</b> { <u>map</u> | <u>epis</u> <u>level</u> }
              Tells DSDA-Doom to begin a new game immediately. For Doom 1 or The Ultimate Doom, you must specify
              the  <u>epis</u>ode  and  <u>level</u>  number to begin at (<u>epis</u> is <b>1</b> for Knee-Deep in the Dead, <b>2</b> for Shores of
              Hell, <b>3</b> for Inferno, <b>4</b> for Thy flesh Consumed; <u>level</u> is between <b>1</b> and <b>9</b>).  For  Doom  2  or  Final
              Doom, you must specify the <u>map</u> to begin at, which is between <b>1</b> and <b>32</b> (<b>30</b> for German Doom 2).

       <b>-skill</b> <u>n</u>
              Tells DSDA-Doom to begin the game at skill level <u>n</u> (<b>1</b> for I'm Too Young To Die; <b>2</b> for Hey, Not Too
              Rough; <b>3</b> for Hurt Me Plenty; <b>4</b> for Ultra-Violent; <b>5</b> for Nightmare!).

       <b>-respawn</b>
              Tells  DSDA-Doom  that monsters that die should respawn (come back to life) after a while. Not for
              the inexperienced.

       <b>-fast</b>  Tells DSDA-Doom to make all the monsters move and react faster. Not for the inexperienced.

       <b>-nomonsters</b>
              Tells DSDA-Doom to include no monsters in the game.

       <b>-nocheats</b>
              Disable applying cheats from dehacked files.

</pre><h4><b>WAD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-iwad</b> <u>iwadname</u>
              Specifies the location of the IWAD file, typically doom.wad or  doom2.wad  (or  doom2f.wad).  This
              tells DSDA-Doom where the main .wad file that came with the version of Doom that you own is.

       <b>-file</b> <u>wad1</u> <u>...</u>
              Specifies  a  list  of  PWAD  files  to  load  in addition to the IWAD file. PWAD files modify the
              existing Doom game, by adding levels or new sounds or graphics. PWAD files  are  widely  available
              for download; try <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/">http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/</a> for starters.

       <b>-deh</b> <u>deh_file</u>
              Tells DSDA-Doom to load the dehacked patch <u>deh_file</u>.

</pre><h4><b>DEMO</b> <b>(LMP)</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-record</b> <u>demofile</u>
              Instructs  DSDA-Doom  to begin recording a demo, to be stored in <u>demofile.lmp</u>.  You should specify
              <b>game</b> <b>options</b> to specify which level and skill to record at.

       <b>-playdemo</b> <u>demofile</u>
              Play the recorded demo <u>demofile.lmp</u>.

       <b>-timedemo</b> <u>demofile</u>
              Play the recorded demo <u>demofile.lmp</u>, reporting information  about  the  length  of  the  demo  (in
              gametics) afterwards.

       <b>-viddump</b> <u>filename</u>
              Record  a  movie file, it requires external command-line encoding tools, oggenc2 (ogg vorbis audio
              encoder), x264 (h264 video encoder) and mkvmerge (mkv  muxer).   It  is  meant  to  be  used  with
              -timedemo, e.g.  "dsda-doom -timedemo anydemo.lmp -viddump filename.mkv".

       <b>-fastdemo</b> <u>demofile</u>
              Play  the  recorded  demo  <u>demofile.lmp</u> as fast as possible. Useful for benchmarking DSDA-Doom, as
              compared to other versions of Doom.

       <b>-ffmap</b> <u>num</u>
              Fast forward the demo (play at max speed) until reaching map <u>num</u> (note  that  this  takes  just  a
              number, not a map name, so so <b>-ffmap</b> <b>7</b> to go fast until MAP07 or ExM7).

       <b>-warp</b> <u>x</u>
              Warps  directly  to the start of map x of a recording without rendering any of the play up to that
              point. Pressing Use (&lt;Space&gt; by default) during skipping shows the current frame.

       <b>-avidemo</b> <u>fileprefix</u>
              Grabbing of the screenshots to frmXXXX.tga.

       <b>-skipsec</b> <u>x</u>
              Skip X secs during viewing of the demo.

       <b>-warp</b> <u>x</u> <b>-skipsec</b> <u>y</u>
              Will skip y seconds on level x.

       <b>-recordfromto</b> <u>n.lmp</u> <u>m</u>
              Play back the demo n.lmp, allowing the user to take over the controls at a point of his  choosing,
              and save the resulting demo as m.lmp.

       <b>-levelstat</b>
              Outputs  a  text-file  called levelstat.txt containing level-by-level information on times, kills,
              items and secrets.

       <b>-spechit</b> <u>xxx</u>
              Provides a spechits magic number, overriding the program's default value.

       <b>-nomonsters</b>
              For playback of -nomonsters demos recorded with Doom.exe 1.2.

       <b>-respawn</b>
              For playback of -respawn demos recorded with Doom.exe 1.2.

       <b>-auto</b>  Enables the autoloading of wads according to the lmp file-name. See below for information.

   <b>DEMOS</b> <b>OLD</b> <b>VERSIONS</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
       <b>-emulate</b> <u>prboom_ver</u>
              For viewing old desynching PrBoom  demos  with  all  recording  bugs  from  a  particular  version
              emulated. For example, "-emulate 2.2.6" would be used to play back a desynching demo recorded with
              PrBoom  2.2.6.  This would be instead of using the various command-line options for each recording
              bug (see below) from that version.

       <b>-force_monster_avoid_hazards</b>
              For viewing old desynching doom-compatible PrBoom demos recorded with "monster_avoid_hazards 1" in
              config.

       <b>-force_remove_slime_trails</b>
              For viewing old desynching doom-compatible demos recorded with old versions of PrBoom (&lt; 2.4.6) or
              PrBoom+ (&lt; 2.4.6.1) that are affected by the "remove slime trails" incompatibility.

       <b>-reject_pad_with_ff</b>
              For viewing old desynching doom-compatible demos recorded with old versions of  PrBoom  (including
              2.2.5 and 2.2.6) that padded a short REJECT with ones instead of zeroes.

       <b>-force_truncated_sector_specials</b>
              For  emulation  of  old  buggy  behaviour whereby Boom's generalized effects could work instead of
              failing in a compatibility mode in the case of a bad action number.

       <b>-force_no_dropoff</b>
              For emulation of MBF_compatibility behaviour in PrBoom 2.2.2 - 2.4.7, whereby things did not  drop
              off ledges when they would have done in MBF.

       <b>-force_prboom_friction</b>
              For  emulation of old buggy behaviour whereby Boom's friction and bobbing code were not faithfully
              replicated.

       <b>-force_force_boom_brainawake</b>
              For emulation of Boom's behaviour with respect to the Monster  Spawner,  which  differed  slightly
              from that of "vanilla" Doom.

       <b>-force_lxdoom_demo_compatibility</b>
              For emulation of all bugs in demo compatibility mode in lxdoom.

       <b>-boom_deh_parser</b>
              Forces the Boom DEH parser.

       <b>-setmem</b> <u>system</u>
              The  desynch  in  fez1-924.lmp  @  fez1.wad is gone, but you still need to add "-setmem dosbox" or
              "-setmem dos71" command line parameter, because  the  default  "dos622"  memory  layout  causes  a
              desynch.

       <b>-deathmatch</b>
              No longer used. Tells DSDA-Doom to begin a deathmatch game, but this is overridden by the server's
              settings. Only works for single play (!).

       <b>-altdeath</b>
              Similar  to  <b>-deathmatch</b>,  but implies a different set of rules for the deathmatch game. No longer
              used (specified by the server).

       <b>-timer</b> <u>mins</u>
              No longer used. Specifies that levels will end after <u>mins</u> minutes of play if the  level  is  still
              being played, but is overridden by the server in a netgame. Not really useful for single play.

       <b>-avg</b>   Equivalent to <b>-timer</b> <b>20</b>.

       <b>-solo-net</b>
              Used  to  run  a  single-player network game, without a network game server.  This enables network
              game items &amp; options for an otherwise single-player game; some demos are recorded like this.

</pre><h4><b>VIDEO</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-width</b> <u>w</u>
              Specifies the width of the DSDA-Doom window, in pixels. Default is <b>320</b>, the width must be  greater
              than 320.

       <b>-height</b> <u>h</u>
              Specifies  the  height  of  the  DSDA-Doom  window,  in pixels. Default is <b>200</b>, the height must be
              greater than 200.

       <b>-viewangle</b> <u>n</u>
              Causes the player view to be rotated by a given offset (specified in 45degree increments,  in  the
              range 0..7) from the way the player is facing.

       <b>-vidmode</b> <u>gl</u>
              Use the OpenGL video mode. The default is to use the software video mode.

       <b>-fullscreen,</b> <b>-nofullscreen</b>
              These options toggle fullscreen mode. The default is fullscreen.

       <b>-window,</b> <b>-nowindow</b>
              This  pair  of  options  also  toggle  fullscreen  mode. They only take effect for this DSDA-Doom+
              session and do not alter your configuration file.

       <b>-noaccel</b>
              For DSDA-Doom, this prevents it using the MITShm server extension for passing the screen  data  to
              the  X  server.  This  option may be required if the X server is not local. For lsdoom, this tells
              lsdoom not to use the accelerated graphics functions that SVGALib  provides  even  when  they  are
              supported for your video card (normally this is autodetected).

       <b>-1</b>, <b>-2</b>, <b>-3</b>
              Specifies  the  scale  factor by which to enlarge the window. The default, <b>-1</b>, displays the normal
              320x200 pixel Doom screen (or whatever size is specified by the <b>-width</b> and <b>-height</b>  parameters  or
              in the config file for DSDA-Doom).  If this window is too small, try using <b>-2</b> or <b>-3</b> to enlarge the
              window.

       <b>-nodraw</b>
              Suppress all graphical display. Only for debugging &amp; demo testing.

       <b>-aspect</b> <u>NxM</u>
              For using a different aspect ratio; e.g. -aspect 5x4, -aspect 8x5 or -aspect 2x1.

       <b>-videodriver</b> <u>name</u>
              For  setting  up  the  videodriver  name that SDL will use (See SDL documentation).  "-videodriver
              default" can be used to force SDL behaviour by default.

       <b>-resetgamma</b>
              Restores the original gamma after a crash.

       <b>-geom</b> <u>NxM</u>
              Basic syntax, for temporarily using a particular resolution without saving this in the  cfg;  e.g.
              -geom 1280x1024.

       <b>-geom</b> <u>WidthxHeight[w|f]</u>
              Advanced syntax, w - windowed, f - fullscreen. Examples: -geom 320x200f, -geom 640x480w.

</pre><h4><b>I/O</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-nosound</b>
              Disables  all  sound effects and in-game music. This prevents the sound server loading, which lets
              the game run a little faster.

       <b>-nosfx</b> Disables sound effects during the game. This does not stop the sound server loading,  however,  so
              for best performance use -nosound.

       <b>-nomusic</b>
              Disables playing of music in the game.

       <b>-nojoy</b> Disables joystick support.

       <b>-nomouse</b>
              Prevents the mouse being grabbed by the DSDA-Doom window.

       <b>-shorttics</b>
              Forces the same mouse behaviour as when recording (i.e. the converse of "-longtics").

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-config</b> <u>myconf</u>
              Loads an alternative configuration file, named <u>myconf</u>. The default is <b><a href="../man5/dsda-doom.cfg.5.html">dsda-doom.cfg</a></b>(5), taken from
              the same directory as DSDA-Doom was run from.

       <b>-save</b> <u>savedir</u>
              Causes DSDA-Doom to save games in the directory specified by <u>savedir</u> instead of <b><a href="file:~/.dsda-doom/">~/.dsda-doom/</a></b>.

       <b>-shotdir</b> <u>shotdir</u>
              Causes DSDA-Doom to save screenshots in <u>shotdir</u> instead of the current directory.

</pre><h4><b>DEBUGGING/PROFILING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-devparm</b>
              Development  mode.  Mostly  redundant these days, but it does force non-lazy generation of texture
              lookups which can be useful for level authors debugging PWADs.

       <b>-debugfile</b> <u>debug_file</u>
              Causes some debugging information, mainly network info, to be written to the named file  as  DSDA-
              Doom runs.

       <b>-nodrawers</b>
              Causes  no  rendering to be done. The only conceivable use of this is (a) a multiplayer server (b)
              to test the speed of the other routines in the program, when combined with <b>-timedemo</b>.

       <b>-noblit</b>
              Causes no copying to the screen from the rendering buffer to be performed.  The  only  conceivable
              use  of  this  is  (a)  a  multiplayer  server  (b) to test the speed of the other routines in the
              program, when combined with <b>-timedemo</b>.

       <b>-bexout</b> <u>bexdbg</u>
              Causes diagnostics related to bex and dehacked file processing to be written to the names file.

       <b>-blockmap</b>
              Use if dsda-doom reports a buggy blockmap.
