</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       2048 - single player slide and add puzzle game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>2048</b> [<u>mode</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>2048</b> command.

       The <b>2048</b> game is a mathematics based puzzle game where you have to slide tiles in a 4x4 board in any of
       the four possible directions by using the arrow keys.

       Touching tiles with the same value are then merged into tiles with the added value of the merged ones.

       You start with a randomly placed pair of 2-valued tiles. New tiles with a value of 2 appear randomly in a
       free position after sliding. To win you have to reach a tile with a value of 2048 before the board is
       full.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Only one argument is allowed, which allows selecting different colors from the original and running
       internal tests. Current supported values for <u>mode</u> are:

       <b>blackwhite</b>
         Runs the program in black and white color scheme.

       <b>bluered</b>
         Runs the program in blue-to-red color scheme (requires 256-color support on terminal).

       <b>test</b>
         Runs internal tests, a good idea before committing changes to the code.
