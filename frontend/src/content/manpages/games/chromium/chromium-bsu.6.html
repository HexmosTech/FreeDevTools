       The following environment variables are used.

       <b>CHROMIUM_BSU_SCORE</b>
              specifies the location of the user high-score file.

       <b>CHROMIUM_BSU_DATA</b>
              specifies the location of user-customised game data with the same  layout  and  filenames  as  the
              system one.

       <b>CHROMIUM_BSU_FONT</b>
              When  using  the  GLC backend, this specifies the font name to be used in the menu and the game if
              available.

              When using the FTGL backend, this specifies the path to the TTF font file used in the menu and the
              game.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The following files are used.

       <u><a href="file:~/.chromium-bsu">~/.chromium-bsu</a></u>
              contains various user preferences.

       <u><a href="file:~/.chromium-bsu-score">~/.chromium-bsu-score</a></u>
              contains the user high-scores.

       <u><a href="file:~/.chromium-bsu-music">~/.chromium-bsu-music</a></u>
              contains a list of music to play during the game.

       <u><a href="file:~/.chromium-bsu-data/">~/.chromium-bsu-data/</a></u>
              directory containing user-customized game data with the same layout and filenames  as  the  system
              one.

       The game will also look in a system directory for data.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration file is a plain text file. Each line contains a key, a single-space separator and then
       a numeric value (integer or floating point).  The following keys are recognised by the game.

       <b>use_playList</b>
              Enable/disable playlist support. This causes the game to open the <a href="file:~/.chromium-bsu-music">~/.chromium-bsu-music</a>  file  and
              play the files listed there.  Disabled by default.  Only works when using OpenAL.

       <b>use_cdrom</b>
              Enable/disable  CDROM  support. This causes the game to attempt to play any audio CD that might be
              available. This is disabled by default because the constant spinning up of the CD can be  annoying
              and  because  CDs  are less popular than MP3/OGG these days. Only works when compiled with SDL 1.X
              support.

       <b>full_screen</b>
              Enable/disable full-screen mode. This causes the game to fill the screen instead of just  using  a
              window. Disabled by default. Only works when using SDL support.

       <b>true_color</b>
              Enable/disable  24-bit  color. When disabled it uses 16-bit color. Disabled by default. Only works
              when using SDL support.

       <b>swap_stereo</b>
              Enable/disable swapping sound orientation. Disabled by default. Only works when using OpenAL.

       <b>auto_speed</b>
              Use an alternate speed adjustment algorithm in certain situations. Disabled by default. Only works
              when using SDL support.

       <b>show_fps</b>
              Print the frames per second at the top right when in a game. Defaults to enabled.
