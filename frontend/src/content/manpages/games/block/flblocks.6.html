</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       flblocks - the fltk block attack! game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Blocks</u>  is  a  FLTK-based block elimination game. Stacks of colored blocks move from right to left as you
       try to eliminate groups of adjacent blocks by clicking on them. As the game progresses, more  colors  are
       added (up to a maximum of 7) and the blocks move faster and faster.

</pre><h4><b>GAME</b> <b>PLAY</b></h4><pre>
       Press  the spacebar to start a game. As the blocks move across the window, click on groups of two or more
       blocks to clear them - the larger the number of adjacent blocks, the greater the score.   Clicking  on  a
       block  containing  a  dark  ball  will  clear all blocks of that color, however you will score much fewer
       points than a normal click. The game is over when the blocks reach the left side of the window.

       Press the spacebar to pause the game.
