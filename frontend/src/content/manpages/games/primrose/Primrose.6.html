</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       primrose - a compelling tile-placement puzzle game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>primrose</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Primrose is a video game written by Jason Rohrer.

       Unlike  his  previous work, primrose is an not art game. Despite the departure from art games to a puzzle
       game, primrose is still beautiful and captivating in its own way.

       The player places pairs of coloured tiles on a 7x7 grid. Tiles are  cleared  by  surrounding  one  colour
       group  with  another colour group, scoring points. The cleared tiles change the colour of the surrounding
       colour group, allowing for chain reactions that give more points. More colours are added  as  more  tiles
       have been placed on the grid and eventually the game will end when the grid fills up.

       The  rush  of  a long chain reaction and the huge numbers of points that can be obtained from them is the
       counterpoint to playing it safe until the bitter grey (but slightly more colourful) end.

       There are many strategies to be explored within that continuum.  Your smartphone with  wireless  internet
       access  is a great place to review and explore the continuum as Primrose includes a networked high scores
       list with instant replay.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Primrose has no command-line options.

       Primrose is primarily controlled with the mouse.

       The escape and q/Q keys quit the game.

       Pressing P in the games brings up the menu. This menu has instructions on how  to  play  the  game,  high
       scores, a dialog to set the name used for high scores as well as toggles for colorblind mode and sound.

       Primrose connects to the web for synchronizing high scores.
