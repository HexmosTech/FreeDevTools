       mac_mls — Multi-Level Security confidentiality policy

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile MLS into your kernel, place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>options</b> <b>MAC</b>
             <b>options</b> <b>MAC_MLS</b>

       Alternately,  to  load the MLS module at boot time, place the following line in your kernel configuration
       file:

             <b>options</b> <b>MAC</b>

       and in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             mac_mls_load="YES"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>mac_mls</b> policy module implements the Multi-Level  Security,  or  MLS  model,  which  controls  access
       between subjects and objects based on their confidentiality by means of a strict information flow policy.
       Each  subject  and  object  in  the  system has an MLS label associated with it; each subject's MLS label
       contains information on its clearance level, and each object's MLS  label  contains  information  on  its
       classification.

       In  MLS,  all  system  subjects and objects are assigned confidentiality labels, made up of a sensitivity
       level and zero or more compartments.  Together, these label elements permit all labels to be placed in  a
       partial  order, with confidentiality protections based on a dominance operator describing the order.  The
       sensitivity level is expressed as a value between 0 and  65535,  with  higher  values  reflecting  higher
       sensitivity levels.  The compartment field is expressed as a set of up to 256 components, numbered from 1
       to 256.  A complete label consists of both sensitivity and compartment elements.

       With  normal  labels,  dominance is defined as a label having a higher or equal active sensitivity level,
       and having at least all of the same compartments as the label  to  which  it  is  being  compared.   With
       respect  to  label  comparisons,  “<b>lower</b>” is defined as being dominated by the label to which it is being
       compared, and “<b>higher</b>” is defined as dominating the label to which it is being compared, and  “<b>equal</b>”  is
       defined as both labels being able to satisfy the dominance requirements over one another.

       Three special label values exist:

             <b>Label</b>        <b>Comparison</b>
             <b>mls/low</b>      dominated by all other labels
             <b>mls/equal</b>    equal to all other labels
             <b>mls/high</b>     dominates all other labels

       The “<b>mls/equal</b>” label may be applied to subjects and objects for which no enforcement of the MLS security
       policy is desired.

       The MLS model enforces the following basic restrictions:

       <b>•</b>   Subjects  may  not  observe the processes of another subject if its clearance level is lower than the
           clearance level of the object it is attempting to observe.

       <b>•</b>   Subjects may not read, write, or otherwise observe objects without proper  clearance  (e.g.  subjects
           may not observe objects whose classification label dominates its own clearance label)

       <b>•</b>   Subjects may not write to objects with a lower classification level than its own clearance level.

       <b>•</b>   A  subject  may  read  and  write  to  an  object  if  its  clearance  level is equal to the object's
           classification level as though MLS protections were not in place.

       These rules prevent subjects of lower clearance from gaining access  information  classified  beyond  its
       clearance  level  in  order  to protect the confidentiality of classified information, subjects of higher
       clearance from writing to objects of lower classification in order to prevent the accidental or malicious
       leaking of information, and subjects of lower clearance  from  observing  subjects  of  higher  clearance
       altogether.   In  traditional trusted operating systems, the MLS confidentiality model is used in concert
       with the Biba integrity model (<u><a href="../man4/mac_biba.4.html">mac_biba</a></u>(4)) in order to protect the Trusted Code Base (TCB).

   <b>Label</b> <b>Format</b>
       Almost  all  system  objects  are  tagged  with  an  effective,  active  label  element,  reflecting  the
       classification  of the object, or classification of the data contained in the object.  In general, object
       labels are represented in the following form:

             <b>mls/</b><u>grade</u>:<u>compartments</u>

       For example:

             mls/10:2+3+6
             mls/low

       Subject labels consist of three label elements: an effective (active)  label,  as  well  as  a  range  of
       available  labels.   This  range  is  represented using two ordered MLS label elements, and when set on a
       process, permits the process to change its active label to any label of greater or equal integrity to the
       low end of the range, and lesser or equal integrity to the high end of the range.   In  general,  subject
       labels are represented in the following form:

             <b>mls/</b><u>effectivegrade</u>:<u>effectivecompartments</u>(<u>lograde</u>:<u>locompartments</u>-
             <u>higrade</u>:<u>hicompartments</u>)

       For example:

             mls/10:2+3+6(5:2+3-20:2+3+4+5+6)
             mls/high(low-high)

       Valid ranged labels must meet the following requirement regarding their elements:

             <u>rangehigh</u> ≥ <u>effective</u> ≥ <u>rangelow</u>

       One  class  of  objects  with ranges currently exists, the network interface.  In the case of the network
       interface, the effective label element references  the  default  label  for  packets  received  over  the
       interface,  and the range represents the range of acceptable labels of packets to be transmitted over the
       interface.

   <b>Runtime</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       The following <u><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></u>(8) MIBs are available for fine-tuning the enforcement of this MAC policy.

       <u>security.mac.mls.enabled</u>     Enables the enforcement of the MLS confidentiality policy.  (Default: 1).

       <u>security.mac.mls.ptys_equal</u>  Label <u><a href="../man4/pty.4.html">pty</a></u>(4)s as “<b>mls/equal</b>” upon creation.  (Default: 0).

       <u>security.mac.mls.revocation_enabled</u>
                                    Revoke access to objects if the label is changed to a more  sensitive  level
                                    than the subject.  (Default: 0).

</pre><h4><b>IMPLEMENTATION</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Currently,  the <b>mac_mls</b> policy relies on superuser status (<u><a href="../man9/suser.9.html">suser</a></u>(9)) in order to change network interface
       MLS labels.  This will eventually go away, but it is currently a liability and may allow the superuser to
       bypass MLS protections.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>mac_mls</b> policy module first appeared in FreeBSD 5.0 and was developed by the TrustedBSD Project.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       This  software  was  contributed  to the FreeBSD Project by Network Associates Laboratories, the Security
       Research Division of Network Associates Inc. under DARPA/SPAWAR contract N66001-01-C-8035  (“CBOSS”),  as
       part of the DARPA CHATS research program.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       While  the  MAC  Framework design is intended to support the containment of the root user, not all attack
       channels are currently protected by entry point checks.  As such, MAC Framework policies  should  not  be
       relied on, in isolation, to protect against a malicious privileged user.
