       iicbus — I2C bus system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>iicbus</u> system provides a uniform, modular and architecture-independent system for the implementation
       of drivers to control various I2C devices and to utilize different I2C controllers.

</pre><h4><b>I2C</b></h4><pre>
       I2C is an acronym for Inter Integrated Circuit bus.  The I2C bus was developed in  the  early  1980's  by
       Philips semiconductors.  Its purpose was to provide an easy way to connect a CPU to peripheral chips in a
       TV-set.

       The  BUS  physically  consists of 2 active wires and a ground connection.  The active wires, SDA and SCL,
       are both bidirectional.  Where SDA is the Serial DAta line and SCL is the Serial CLock line.

       Every component hooked up to the bus has its own unique address whether it is a CPU, LCD driver,  memory,
       or  complex function chip.  Each of these chips can act as a receiver and/or transmitter depending on its
       functionality.  Obviously an LCD driver is only a receiver, while a  memory  or  I/O  chip  can  both  be
       transmitter and receiver.  Furthermore there may be one or more BUS MASTERs.

       The  BUS  MASTER  is  the  chip issuing the commands on the BUS.  In the I2C protocol specification it is
       stated that the IC that initiates a data transfer on the bus is considered the BUS MASTER.  At that  time
       all the others are regarded to as the BUS SLAVEs.  As mentioned before, the IC bus is a Multi-MASTER BUS.
       This means that more than one IC capable of initiating data transfer can be connected to it.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       Some I2C device drivers are available:

       <u>Devices</u>           <u>Description</u>
       <b>iic</b>               general i/o operation
       <b>ic</b>                network IP interface
       <b>iicsmb</b>            I2C to SMB software bridge

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACES</b></h4><pre>
       The  I2C  protocol  may  be implemented by hardware or software.  Software interfaces rely on very simple
       hardware, usually two lines twiddled by 2  registers.   Hardware  interfaces  are  more  intelligent  and
       receive 8-bit characters they write to the bus according to the I2C protocol.

       I2C  interfaces  may  act on the bus as slave devices, allowing spontaneous bidirectional communications,
       thanks to the multi-master capabilities of the I2C protocol.

       Some I2C interfaces are available:

       <u>Interface</u>            <u>Description</u>
       <b>pcf</b>                  Philips PCF8584 master/slave interface
       <b>iicbb</b>                generic bit-banging master-only driver
       <b>lpbb</b>                 parallel port specific bit-banging interface
       <b>bktr</b>                 Brooktree848 video chipset, hardware and software master-only interface

</pre><h4><b>BUS</b> <b>FREQUENCY</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The operating frequency of an I2C bus may be fixed or configurable.  The bus may be used as part of  some
       larger  standard  interface,  and that interface specification may require a fixed frequency.  The driver
       for that hardware would not honor an attempt to configure a different speed.  A general purpose I2C  bus,
       such as those found in many embedded systems, will often support multiple bus frequencies.

       When  a  system  supports  multiple  I2C  buses,  a different frequency can be configured for each bus by
       number, represented by the <u>%d</u> in the variable names below.  Buses can be configured using any combination
       of device hints, Flattened Device Tree (FDT) data, tunables  set  via  <u><a href="../man8/loader.8.html">loader</a></u>(8),  or  at  runtime  using
       <u><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></u>(8).   When  configuration  is  supplied  using  more  than  one  method, FDT and hint data will be
       overridden by a tunable, which can be overridden by <u><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></u>(8).

   <b>Device</b> <b>Hints</b>
       Set <u>hint.iicbus.%d.frequency</u> to the frequency in Hz, on systems that use device hints  to  configure  I2C
       devices.  The hint is also honored by systems that use FDT data if no frequency is configured using FDT.

   <b>Flattened</b> <b>Device</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>Data</b>
       Configure  the  I2C  bus speed using the FDT standard <u>clock-frequency</u> property of the node describing the
       I2C controller hardware.

   <b>Sysctl</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tunable</b>
       Set <u>dev.iicbus.%d.frequency</u> in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5).  The same  variable  can  be  changed  at  any  time  with
       <u><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></u>(8).  Reset the bus using <u><a href="../man8/i2c.8.html">i2c</a></u>(8) or the <u><a href="../man4/iic.4.html">iic</a></u>(4) <u>I2CRSTCARD</u> ioctl to make the change take effect.
