</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>CAM</b>  subsystem  provides  a  uniform and modular system for the implementation of drivers to control
       various SCSI, ATA, NMVe, and MMC / SD devices, and to utilize different SCSI, ATA, NVMe,  and  MMC  /  SD
       host  adapters  through  host  adapter drivers.  When the system probes buses, it attaches any devices it
       finds to the appropriate drivers.  The <u><a href="../man4/pass.4.html">pass</a></u>(4) driver, if it is configured in the kernel, will attach  to
       all devices.

</pre><h4><b>KERNEL</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       There are a number of generic kernel configuration options for the <b>CAM</b> subsystem:

       CAMDEBUG               This option compiles in all the <b>CAM</b> debugging printf code.  This will not actually
                              cause  any  debugging  information to be printed out when included by itself.  See
                              below for details.

       CAM_MAX_HIGHPOWER=4    This sets the maximum allowable number of concurrent  "high  power"  commands.   A
                              "high  power"  command  is a command that takes more electrical power than most to
                              complete.  An example of this is the SCSI START UNIT  command.   Starting  a  disk
                              often  takes  significantly  more  electrical  power  than normal operation.  This
                              option allows the user to specify how many concurrent high power commands  may  be
                              outstanding without overloading the power supply on his computer.

       SCSI_NO_SENSE_STRINGS  This  eliminates  text  descriptions  of  each  SCSI  Additional  Sense  Code  and
                              Additional Sense Code Qualifier pair.  Since this is a fairly large text database,
                              eliminating it reduces the  size  of  the  kernel  somewhat.   This  is  primarily
                              necessary  for  boot  floppies  and  other  low  disk  space  or  low memory space
                              environments.  In most cases, though, this should be enabled, since it speeds  the
                              interpretation  of SCSI error messages.  Do not let the "kernel bloat" zealots get
                              to you -- leave the sense descriptions in your kernel!

       SCSI_NO_OP_STRINGS     This disables text descriptions of each SCSI opcode.  This option, like the  sense
                              string option above, is primarily useful for environments like a boot floppy where
                              kernel  size is critical.  Enabling this option for normal use is not recommended,
                              since it slows debugging of SCSI problems.

       SCSI_DELAY=8000        This is the SCSI "bus settle delay."  In <b>CAM</b>, it is specified in <u>milliseconds</u>, not
                              seconds like the old SCSI layer used to do.  When the kernel boots, it sends a bus
                              reset to each SCSI bus to tell each device to reset itself to  a  default  set  of
                              transfer  negotiations  and other settings.  Most SCSI devices need some amount of
                              time to recover from a bus reset.  Newer disks may need as little as 100ms,  while
                              old,  slow  devices  may need much longer.  If the SCSI_DELAY is not specified, it
                              defaults to 2 seconds.  The minimum allowable value for SCSI_DELAY  is  "100",  or
                              100ms.  One special case is that if the SCSI_DELAY is set to 0, that will be taken
                              to  mean  the "lowest possible value."  In that case, the SCSI_DELAY will be reset
                              to 100ms.

       All devices and buses support dynamic allocation so that an upper number of devices and controllers  does
       not need to be configured; <b>device</b> <b>da</b> will suffice for any number of disk drivers.

       The devices are either <u>wired</u> so they appear as a particular device unit or <u>counted</u> so that they appear as
       the next available unused unit.

       Units are wired down by setting kernel environment hints.  This is usually done either interactively from
       the <u><a href="../man8/loader.8.html">loader</a></u>(8), or automatically via the <u>/boot/device.hints</u> file.  The basic syntax is:

             hint.device.unit.property="value"

       Individual  <b>CAM</b>  bus  numbers can be wired down to specific controllers with a config line similar to the
       following:

             hint.scbus.0.at="ahd1"

       This assigns <b>CAM</b> bus number 0 to the <u>ahd1</u> driver instance.  For controllers supporting more than one bus,
       a particular bus can be assigned as follows:

             hint.scbus.0.at="ahc1"
             hint.scbus.0.bus="1"

       This assigns <b>CAM</b> bus 0 to the bus 1 instance on <u>ahc1</u>.  Peripheral drivers can be wired to a specific bus,
       target, and lun as so:

             hint.da.0.at="scbus0"
             hint.da.0.target="0"
             hint.da.0.unit="0"

       This assigns <u>da0</u> to target 0, unit (lun) 0 of scbus 0.  Omitting the target or unit hints  will  instruct
       <b>CAM</b>  to  treat  them  as wildcards and use the first respective counted instances.  These examples can be
       combined together to allow a peripheral device to be wired to any  particular  controller,  bus,  target,
       and/or unit instance.

       This also works with <u><a href="../man4/nvme.4.html">nvme</a></u>(4) drives as well.

             hint.nvme.4.at="pci7:0:0"
             hint.scbus.10.at="nvme4"
             hint.nda.10.at="scbus10"
             hint.nda.10.target="1"
             hint.nda.10.unit="12"
             hint.nda.11.at="scbus10"
             hint.nda.11.target="1"
             hint.nda.11.unit="2"

       This  assigns  the  NVMe card living at PCI bus 7 to scbus 10 (in PCIe, slot and function are rarely used
       and usually 0).  The target for <u><a href="../man4/nda.4.html">nda</a></u>(4) devices is always 1.  The unit is the  namespace  identifier  from
       the drive.  The namespace id 1 is exported as nda10 and namespace id 2 is exported as nda11.

       When  you  have  a mixture of wired down and counted devices then the counting begins with the first non-
       wired down unit for a particular type.  That is, if you have a disk wired down as <u>device</u>  <u>da1</u>,  then  the
       first non-wired disk shall come on line as <u>da2</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ADAPTERS</b></h4><pre>
       The  system  allows common device drivers to work through many different types of adapters.  The adapters
       take requests from the upper layers and do all IO between the SCSI, ATA, NVMe, or MMC / SD  bus  and  the
       system.  The maximum size of a transfer is governed by the adapter.  Most adapters can transfer 64KB in a
       single operation, however many can transfer larger amounts.

</pre><h4><b>TARGET</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       Some  adapters support <u>target</u> <u>mode</u> in which the system is capable of operating as a device, responding to
       operations initiated by another system.  Target mode is supported for  some  adapters,  but  is  not  yet
       complete for this version of the <b>CAM</b> SCSI subsystem.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       see other <b>CAM</b> device entries.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       An  XPT_DEBUG CCB can be used to enable various amounts of tracing information on any specific bus/device
       from the list of options compiled into the kernel.  There are currently seven debugging flags that may be
       compiled in and used:

       CAM_DEBUG_INFO      This flag enables  general  informational  printfs  for  the  device  or  devices  in
                           question.

       CAM_DEBUG_TRACE     This  flag  enables  function-level  command  flow  tracing i.e., kernel printfs will
                           happen at the entrance and exit of various functions.

       CAM_DEBUG_SUBTRACE  This flag enables debugging output internal to various functions.

       CAM_DEBUG_CDB       This flag will cause the kernel to print out all ATA and  SCSI  commands  sent  to  a
                           particular device or devices.

       CAM_DEBUG_XPT       This flag will enable command scheduler tracing.

       CAM_DEBUG_PERIPH    This flag will enable peripheral drivers messages.

       CAM_DEBUG_PROBE     This flag will enable devices probe process tracing.

       Some  of these flags, most notably CAM_DEBUG_TRACE and CAM_DEBUG_SUBTRACE, will produce kernel printfs in
       EXTREME numbers.

       Users can enable debugging from their kernel config file, by using the following kernel config options:

       CAMDEBUG           This builds into the kernel all possible <b>CAM</b> debugging.

       CAM_DEBUG_COMPILE  This allows to specify support for which debugging flags  described  above  should  be
                          built  into  the kernel.  Flags may be ORed together if the user wishes to see printfs
                          for multiple debugging levels.

       CAM_DEBUG_FLAGS    This allows to set the various debugging flags from a kernel config file.

       CAM_DEBUG_BUS      Specify a bus to debug.  To debug all buses, set this to -1.

       CAM_DEBUG_TARGET   Specify a target to debug.  To debug all targets, set this to -1.

       CAM_DEBUG_LUN      Specify a lun to debug.  To debug all luns, set this to -1.

       Users may also enable debugging on the fly by using the <u><a href="../man8/camcontrol.8.html">camcontrol</a></u>(8) utility, if  wanted  options  built
       into the kernel.  See <u><a href="../man8/camcontrol.8.html">camcontrol</a></u>(8) for details.
