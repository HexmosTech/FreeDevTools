       AF_AX25 - AX.25 amateur packet radio protocol family

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AX.25</b> is a protocol used extensively by radio amateurs. The Linux AX.25 protocol family permits access to
       these protocols via the standard networking <b>socket</b> metaphor.

       The  AX.25  protocol  layer supports both connected mode and datagram (UI) frame modes. IP traffic may be
       stacked on top of AX.25 frames for IP transmission over the AX.25 medium.

       The primary mode of  operation  is  connected  mode  which  is  the  mode  used  for  a  socket  of  type
       <b>SOCK_SEQPACKET</b>  (stream  sockets are not available in AX.25).  This requires that the user ensures output
       data is suitably packetised, and that input data is read a packet at a time into  a  buffer  of  suitable
       size.   The Linux AX.25 protocol layer can operate in standard AX.25 mode with three bit sequence numbers
       or in PE1CHL extended AX.25 mode which uses seven bit sequence numbers. The protocol passed to the socket
       is used for all outgoing frames. Passing 0 causes the normal AX.25 Text PID to be used.

       <b>SOCK_DGRAM</b> gives access to AX.25 UI frames. For access to special frames (of any form)  SOCK_RAW  can  be
       used.

       AX.25  addresses  consist  of  6 <b>ASCII</b> characters and a number called the SSID.  These are encoded into a
       sockaddr_ax25 structure which is provided to the relevant system calls. When digipeaters are  included  a
       callsign  path  can  be  much  more  complex. When this is the case a struct full_sockaddr_ax25 should be
       passed to the system calls.

       AX.25 has some unusual properties. Notably in a multi-user system an AX.25 address  is  often  associated
       with a user, and some users may not have such an association. a set of ioctl calls are provided to manage
       an  association  table,  and  in  addition  the superuser may use an arbitrary callsign by binding to the
       callsign desired and specifying the port to use as a first digipeated hop.

       AX.25 supports the following socket options for <b>SOL_AX25</b>.  <b>AX25_T1</b> is  the  T1  timer  in  1/10ths  of  a
       second,  AX25_T2  is the T2 timer in 1/10ths of a second, <b>AX25_T3</b> is the T3 timer. The window is settable
       with <b>AX25_WINDOW</b>.  <b>AX25_N2</b>, the retry counter is also configurable. There is no 'infinite  retry'  option
       supported  however. The method of backoff for retries is configurable via the socket option <b>AX25_BACKOFF</b>,
       a value of true indicates the use of exponential backoff and false simple linear backoff. The mode  of  a
       connection made be altered to be either standard AX.25 or extended AX.25 via <b>AX25_EXTSEQ</b>.  It is possible
       to  have  the complete AX.25 header returned to the application by setting <b>AX25_HDRINCL</b> to true, programs
       must be aware of the internal structure  of  AX.25  frames  to  use  this  option.  Note  that  if  AX.25
       fragmentation  is encountered, only the control information of the first frame is returned along with the
       defragmented data.
