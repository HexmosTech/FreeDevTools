</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ses — SCSI Environmental Services driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>device</b> <b>ses</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ses</b>  driver  provides  support  for  all  SCSI  devices of the environmental services class that are
       attached to the system through a supported SCSI Host Adapter, as well  as  emulated  support  for  SAF-TE
       (SCSI  Accessible  Fault  Tolerant Enclosures).  The environmental services class generally are enclosure
       devices that provide environmental information such as number of power supplies (and state), temperature,
       device slots, and so on.

       A SCSI Host adapter must also be separately configured  into  the  system  before  a  SCSI  Environmental
       Services device can be configured.

</pre><h4><b>KERNEL</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       It is only necessary to explicitly configure one <b>ses</b> device; data structures are dynamically allocated as
       devices are found on the SCSI bus.

       A  separate option, <u>SES_ENABLE_PASSTHROUGH</u>, may be specified to allow the <b>ses</b> driver to perform functions
       on devices of other classes that claim to also support <b>ses</b> functionality.

</pre><h4><b>IOCTLS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  <u><a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</a></u>(2)  calls  apply  to  <b>ses</b>  devices.   They  are  defined   in   the   header   file
       &lt;<u>cam/scsi/scsi_enc.h</u>&gt; (<u>q.v.</u>).

       ENCIOC_GETNELM     Used to find out how many <b>ses</b> elements are driven by this particular device instance.

       ENCIOC_GETELMMAP   Read, from the kernel, an array of SES elements which contains the element identifier,
                          which subenclosure it is in, and the <b>ses</b> type of the element.

       ENCIOC_GETENCSTAT  Get the overall enclosure status.

       ENCIOC_SETENCSTAT  Set the overall enclosure status.

       ENCIOC_GETELMSTAT  Get the status of a particular element.

       ENCIOC_SETELMSTAT  Set the status of a particular element.

       ENCIOC_GETTEXT     Get  the associated help text for an element (not yet implemented).  <b>ses</b> devices often
                          have descriptive text for an element which can tell you things  like  location  (e.g.,
                          "left power supply").

       ENCIOC_INIT        Initialize the enclosure.

       ENCIOC_GETELMDESC  Get the element's descriptor string.

       ENCIOC_GETELMDEVNAMES
                          Get the device names, if any, associated with this element.

       ENCIOC_GETSTRING   Used to read the SES String In Diagnostic Page.  The contents of this page are device-
                          specific.

       ENCIOC_SETSTRING   Used to set the SES String Out Diagnostic Page.  The contents of this page are device-
                          specific.

       ENCIOC_GETENCNAME  Used to get the name of the enclosure.

       ENCIOC_GETENCID    Used to get the Enclosure Logical Identifier.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  files contained in &lt;<u>/usr/share/examples/ses</u>&gt; show simple mechanisms for how to use these interfaces,
       as well as a very stupid simple monitoring daemon.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/dev/sesN</u>      The <u>Nth</u> <b>SES</b> device.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       When the kernel is configured with DEBUG enabled, the first open to an SES device will spit  out  overall
       enclosure parameters to the console.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ses</b>  driver was originally written for the CAM SCSI subsystem by Matthew Jacob and first released in
       FreeBSD 4.3.  It was a functional equivalent of a similar driver available in Solaris, Release 7.  It was
       largely rewritten by Alexander Motin, Justin Gibbs, and Will Andrews for FreeBSD 9.2.
