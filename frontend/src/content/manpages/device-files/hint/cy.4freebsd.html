</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>cy</b>  driver  provides  support  for Cirrus Logic CD1400-based EIA RS-232C (CCITT V.24) communications
       interfaces (ports) on Cyclades Cyclom-Y boards.  Each CD1400 provides  4  ports.   Cyclom-Y  boards  with
       various numbers of CD1400's are available.  This driver supports up to 8 CD1400's (32 ports) per board.

       Input  and  output  for each line may set independently to the following speeds: 50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150,
       300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, or 115200 bps.  Other speeds of up to 150000
       are supported by the termios interface but not by the sgttyb compatibility interface.  The CD1400 is  not
       fast  enough to handle speeds above 115200 bps effectively.  It can transmit on a single line at slightly
       more than 115200 bps, but when 4 lines are active in both directions its limit is about 90000 bps on each
       line.

       Serial ports controlled by the <b>cy</b> driver can be used for both `callin'  and  `callout'.   For  each  port
       there is a callin device and a callout device.  The minor number of the callout device is 128 higher than
       that  of  the  corresponding  callin  port.   The callin device is general purpose.  Processes opening it
       normally wait for carrier and for the callout device to become inactive.  The callout device is  used  to
       steal the port from processes waiting for carrier on the callin device.  Processes opening it do not wait
       for  carrier  and  put any processes waiting for carrier on the callin device into a deeper sleep so that
       they do not conflict with the callout session.  The callout device is abused for handling  programs  that
       are  supposed to work on general ports and need to open the port without waiting but are too stupid to do
       so.

       The <b>cy</b> driver also supports an initial-state and a lock-state control device for each of the  callin  and
       the  callout  "data" devices.  The minor number of the initial-state device is 32 higher than that of the
       corresponding data device.  The minor number of the lock-state device is  64  higher  than  that  of  the
       corresponding  data  device.   The  termios  settings  of  a  data  device  are  copied from those of the
       corresponding initial-state device on first opens and are not inherited from previous opens.  Use <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1)
       in the normal way on the initial-state devices to program initial termios states suitable for your setup.

       The lock termios state acts as flags to disable changing  the  termios  state.   E.g.,  to  lock  a  flag
       variable  such  as CRTSCTS, use <u>stty</u> <u>crtscts</u> on the lock-state device.  Speeds and special characters may
       be locked by setting the corresponding value in the lock-state device to any nonzero value.

       Correct programs talking to correctly wired external devices work with almost  arbitrary  initial  states
       and  almost  no locking, but other setups may benefit from changing some of the default initial state and
       locking the state.  In particular, the initial states for non (POSIX) standard flags  should  be  set  to
       suit  the devices attached and may need to be locked to prevent buggy programs from changing them.  E.g.,
       CRTSCTS should be locked on for devices that support RTS/CTS handshaking at all times and off for devices
       that do not support it at all.  CLOCAL should be locked on for  devices  that  do  not  support  carrier.
       HUPCL  may  be  locked  off  if  you do not want to hang up for some reason.  In general, very bad things
       happen if something is locked to the wrong state, and things  should  not  be  locked  for  devices  that
       support  more than one setting.  The CLOCAL flag on callin ports should be locked off for logins to avoid
       certain security holes, but this needs to be done by getty if the callin port is used for anything else.

   <b>Kernel</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Options</b>
       The <u>CY_PCI_FASTINTR</u> option should be used to avoid suboptimal interrupt handling for PCI Cyclades boards.
       The PCI BIOS must be configured with the <b>cy</b> interrupt not shared with any other active  device  for  this
       option to work.  This option is not the default because it is currently harmful in certain cases where it
       does not work.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/dev/ttyc??</u>   for callin ports
       <u>/dev/ttyic??</u>
       <u>/dev/ttylc??</u>  corresponding callin initial-state and lock-state devices

       <u>/dev/cuac??</u>   for callout ports
       <u>/dev/cuaic??</u>
       <u>/dev/cualc??</u>  corresponding callout initial-state and lock-state devices

       <u>/etc/rc.serial</u>  examples of setting the initial-state and lock-state devices

       The  first  question  mark in these device names is short for the card number (a decimal number between 0
       and 65535 inclusive).  The second question mark is short for the port  number  (a  letter  in  the  range
       [0-9a-v]).

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cy%d:</b> <b>silo</b> <b>overflow.</b>  Problem in the interrupt handler.

       <b>cy%d:</b> <b>interrupt-level</b> <b>buffer</b> <b>overflow.</b>  Problem in the bottom half of the driver.

       <b>cy%d:</b>  <b>tty-level</b>  <b>buffer</b>  <b>overflow.</b>  Problem in the application.  Input has arrived faster than the given
       module could process it and some has been lost.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>cy</b> driver is derived from the <b>sio</b> driver and the NetBSD <b>cy</b> driver and is currently under development.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Serial consoles are not implemented.
