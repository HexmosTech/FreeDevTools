</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cs — Ethernet device driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>device</b> <b>cs</b>

       Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             if_cs_load="YES"

       In <u>/boot/device.hints</u>:
       <b>hint.cs.0.at="isa"</b>
       <b>hint.cs.0.port="0x300"</b>
       <b>hint.cs.0.irq="10"</b>
       <b>hint.cs.0.maddr="0xd000"</b>

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATION</b> <b>NOTICE</b></h4><pre>
       The      <b>cs</b>     driver     is     not     present     in     FreeBSD     13.0     and     later.      See
       https://github.com/freebsd/fcp/blob/master/fcp-0101.md for more information.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>cs</b> driver provides support for ISA Ethernet adapters based on the Crystal  Semiconductor  CS8900  and
       CS8920  NICs.   These devices are used on the IBM EtherJet ISA adapters and in many embedded applications
       where the high integration, small size and low cost of the CS89x0 family compensate for their drawbacks.

       The <b>cs</b> driver will obtain configuration parameters either from <u>/boot/device.hints</u> or from the  card.   At
       least  the  I/O  port number must be specified.  Other parameters specified in <u>/boot/device.hints</u> will be
       used if present; the card may be soft-configured so these may be any valid value.  Adapters based on  the
       CS8920  normally  offer  PnP  configuration  and  the driver will detect the IBM EtherJet and the CSC6040
       adapters automatically.

       Note that the CS8900 is limited to 4 IRQ values; these are normally implemented as 5, 10, 11 and 12.  The
       CS8920 has no such limitation.

       Memory-mapped and DMA operation are not supported at this time.

       In addition to the ISA devices, the PC Card devices based on the CS889x0 family are also supported.   The
       IBM  EtherJet PCMCIA Card is the only known device based on this chip.  The PC Card support does not need
       the above specific ISA hints to work.  The PC Card support may not work for 10base2 (thinnet) connections
       and may bogusly claim to support 10base5 (there are no known cards that have an AUI necessary for 10base5
       support on their dongles).

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cs%d:</b> <b>full/half</b> <b>duplex</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>timeout</b>  The attempt to negotiate duplex settings with the  hub  timed
       out.  This may indicate a cabling problem or a faulty or incompatible hub.

       <b>cs%d:</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enable</b> <b>&lt;media&gt;</b>  The CS89x0 failed to select the nominated media, either because it is not
       present or not operating correctly.

       <b>cs%d:</b>  <b>No</b>  <b>EEPROM,</b>  <b>assuming</b>  <b>defaults</b>    The CS89x0 does not have an EEPROM, or the EEPROM is hopelessly
       damaged.  Operation will only be successful if the configuration entry  lists  suitable  values  for  the
       adapter.

       <b>cs%d:</b> <b>Invalid</b> <b>irq</b>  The IRQ specified in the configuration entry is not valid for the adapter.

       <b>cs%d:</b>  <b>Could</b>  <b>not</b>  <b>allocate</b>  <b>memory</b>  <b>for</b>  <b>NIC</b>  There is a critical memory shortage.  The adapter will not
       function.

       <b>cs%d:</b> <b>Adapter</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>media</b>  The adapter is not configured for a specific media type.  The media type will
       have to be manually set.

       <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>%s,</b> <b>but</b> <b>LDN</b> <b>%d</b> <b>is</b> <b>disabled</b>  The PnP probe code found a recognised adapter, but the  adapter  is
       disabled.

       <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>pnp</b> <b>parms</b>  A PnP adapter was found, but configuration parameters for it could not be read.

       <b>failed</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>pnp</b>  <b>card</b>  <b>parameters</b>   The parameters obtained via PnP were not accepted by the driver.  The
       adapter may not function.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>cs</b> device driver was written by Maxim Bolotin and Oleg Sharoiko.  This manpage was written by Michael
       Smith.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The CS89x0 family of adapters have a very small RAM buffer (4K).  This may cause problems with  extremely
       high  network  loads  or  bursty  network traffic.  In particular, NFS operations should be limited to 1k
       read/write transactions in order to avoid overruns.
