</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mse — bus and InPort mice driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>device</b> <b>mse</b>

       In <u>/boot/device.hints</u>:
       <b>hint.mse.0.at="isa"</b>
       <b>hint.mse.0.port="0x23c"</b>
       <b>hint.mse.0.irq="5"</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>mse</b>  driver  provides  support  for the bus mouse and the InPort mouse, which are often collectively
       called ``bus'' mice, as these mice are sold with an interface card which needs  to  be  installed  in  an
       expansion  bus  slot.   The interface circuit may come on an integrated I/O card or as an option on video
       cards.

       The bus and InPort mice have two or three buttons, and a D-sub 9-pin male connector or a round DIN  9-pin
       male connector.

       The  primary  port  address of the bus and InPort mouse interface cards is usually 0x23c.  Some cards may
       also be set to use the secondary port address at 0x238.  The interface cards require a single IRQ,  which
       may  be  2,  3,  4  or  5.  Some cards may offer additional IRQs.  The port number and the IRQ number are
       configured by jumpers on the cards or by software provided with the card.

       Frequency, or report rate, at which the device sends movement  and  button  state  reports  to  the  host
       system, may also be configurable on some interface cards.  It may be 15, 30, 60 or 120Hz.

       The  difference  between  the two types of the mice is not in mouse devices (in fact they are exactly the
       same).  But in the circuit on the interface cards.  This means that the device from a bus  mouse  package
       can  be  connected to the interface card from an InPort mouse package, or vice versa, provided that their
       connectors match.

   <b>Operation</b> <b>Levels</b>
       The <b>mse</b> driver has two levels of operation.  The current operation level can be set via an ioctl call.

       At the level zero the basic support is provided; the device driver will report  horizontal  and  vertical
       movement  of the attached device and state of up to three buttons in the format described below.  It is a
       subset of the MouseSystems protocol.

       Byte 1
               bit 7  Always one.
               bit 6..3
                      Always zero.
               bit 2  Left button status; cleared if pressed, otherwise set.
               bit 1  Middle button status; cleared if pressed, otherwise set.  Always one, if the  device  does
                      not have the middle button.
               bit 0  Right button status; cleared if pressed, otherwise set.
       Byte 2  Horizontal movement count in two's compliment; -128 through 127.
       Byte 3  Vertical movement count in two's compliment; -128 through 127.
       Byte 4  Always zero.
       Byte 5  Always zero.

       This  is the default level of operation and the driver is initially at this level when opened by the user
       program.

       At the operation  level  one  (extended  level),  a  data  packet  is  encoded  in  the  standard  format
       MOUSE_PROTO_SYSMOUSE as defined in <u><a href="../man4/mouse.4.html">mouse</a></u>(4).

   <b>Acceleration</b>
       The  <b>mse</b>  driver  can somewhat `accelerate' the movement of the pointing device.  The faster you move the
       device, the further the pointer travels on the screen.  The driver has an internal variable which governs
       the effect of the acceleration.  Its value can be modified via the driver flag or via an ioctl call.

   <b>Device</b> <b>Number</b>
       The minor device number of the <b>mse</b> is made up of:

             minor = (`unit' &lt;&lt; 1) | `non-blocking'

       where `unit' is the device number (usually 0) and the `non-blocking' bit is  set  to  indicate  ``do  not
       block  waiting  for mouse input, return immediately''.  The `non-blocking' bit should be set for <u>XFree86</u>,
       therefore the minor device number usually used for <u>XFree86</u> is 1.  See “FILES” for device node names.

</pre><h4><b>DRIVER</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Driver</b> <b>Flags</b>
       The <b>mse</b> driver accepts the following  driver  flag.   Set  it  in  the  kernel  configuration  file  (see
       <u><a href="../man8/config.8.html">config</a></u>(8)) or in the User Configuration Menu at the boot time (see <u><a href="../man8/boot.8.html">boot</a></u>(8)).

       bit 4..7 ACCELERATION
              This flag controls the amount of acceleration effect.  The smaller the value of this flag is, more
              sensitive  the movement becomes.  The minimum value allowed, thus the value for the most sensitive
              setting, is one.  Setting this flag to zero will completely disables the acceleration effect.

</pre><h4><b>IOCTLS</b></h4><pre>
       There are a few <u><a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</a></u>(2) commands for mouse drivers.  These commands and related structures and constants
       are defined in &lt;<u>sys/mouse.h</u>&gt;.  General description of the commands is given in  <u><a href="../man4/mouse.4.html">mouse</a></u>(4).   This  section
       explains the features specific to the <b>mse</b> driver.

       MOUSE_GETLEVEL <u>int</u> <u>*level</u>
       MOUSE_SETLEVEL <u>int</u> <u>*level</u>
              These commands manipulate the operation level of the <b>mse</b> driver.

       MOUSE_GETHWINFO <u>mousehw_t</u> <u>*hw</u>
              Returns  the  hardware  information  of  the attached device in the following structure.  Only the
              iftype field is guaranteed to be filled with the correct value by the current version of  the  <b>mse</b>
              driver.

              typedef struct mousehw {
                  int buttons;    /* number of buttons */
                  int iftype;     /* I/F type */
                  int type;       /* mouse/track ball/pad... */
                  int model;      /* I/F dependent model ID */
                  int hwid;       /* I/F dependent hardware ID */
              } mousehw_t;

              The buttons field holds the number of buttons on the device.

              The iftype is either MOUSE_IF_BUS or MOUSE_IF_INPORT.

              The type may be MOUSE_MOUSE, MOUSE_TRACKBALL, MOUSE_STICK, MOUSE_PAD, or MOUSE_UNKNOWN.

              The  model  is always MOUSE_MODEL_GENERIC at the operation level 0.  It may be MOUSE_MODEL_GENERIC
              or one of MOUSE_MODEL_XXX constants at higher operation levels.

              The hwid is always 0.

       MOUSE_GETMODE <u>mousemode_t</u> <u>*mode</u>
              The command gets the current operation parameters of the mouse driver.

              typedef struct mousemode {
                  int protocol;    /* MOUSE_PROTO_XXX */
                  int rate;        /* report rate (per sec), -1 if unknown */
                  int resolution;  /* MOUSE_RES_XXX, -1 if unknown */
                  int accelfactor; /* acceleration factor */
                  int level;       /* driver operation level */
                  int packetsize;  /* the length of the data packet */
                  unsigned char syncmask[2]; /* sync. bits */
              } mousemode_t;

              The protocol is  either  MOUSE_PROTO_BUS  or  MOUSE_PROTO_INPORT  at  the  operation  level  zero.
              MOUSE_PROTO_SYSMOUSE at the operation level one.

              The  rate is the status report rate (reports/sec) at which the device will send movement report to
              the host computer.  As there is no standard to detect the current setting, this  field  is  always
              set to -1.

              The resolution is always set to -1.

              The  accelfactor  field holds a value to control acceleration feature (see “Acceleration”).  It is
              zero or greater.  If it is zero, acceleration is disabled.

              The packetsize field specifies the length of the data packet.  It depends on the operation level.

              <u>level</u> <u>0</u>    5 bytes
              <u>level</u> <u>1</u>    8 bytes

              The array syncmask holds a bit mask and pattern to detect the  first  byte  of  the  data  packet.
              syncmask[0]  is  the bit mask to be ANDed with a byte.  If the result is equal to syncmask[1], the
              byte is likely to be the first byte of the data packet.  Note that this detection  method  is  not
              100% reliable, thus, should be taken only as an advisory measure.

              Only  level and accelfactor are modifiable by the MOUSE_SETMODE command.  Changing the other field
              does not cause error, but has no effect.

       MOUSE_SETMODE <u>mousemode_t</u> <u>*mode</u>
              The command changes the current operation parameters of the mouse driver  as  specified  in  <u>mode</u>.
              Only level and accelfactor may be modifiable.  Setting values in the other field does not generate
              error and has no effect.

       MOUSE_READDATA <u>mousedata_t</u> <u>*data</u>
       MOUSE_READSTATE <u>mousedata_t</u> <u>*state</u>
              These commands are not supported by the <b>mse</b> driver.

       MOUSE_GETSTATUS <u>mousestatus_t</u> <u>*status</u>
              The command returns the current state of buttons and movement counts as described in <u><a href="../man4/mouse.4.html">mouse</a></u>(4).

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Some  bus mouse interface cards generate interrupts at the fixed report rate when enabled, whether or not
       the mouse state is changing.  The others generate interrupts only when the state is changing.
