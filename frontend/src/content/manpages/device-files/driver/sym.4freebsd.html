       sym — NCR/Symbios/LSI Logic 53C8XX PCI SCSI host adapter driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>device</b> <b>pci</b>
             <b>device</b> <b>scbus</b>
             <b>device</b> <b>sym</b>

             To disable PCI parity checking (needed for broken bridges):
             <b>options</b> <b>SYM_SETUP_PCI_PARITY=&lt;boolean&gt;</b>

             To control driver probing against HVD buses:
             <b>options</b> <b>SYM_SETUP_SCSI_DIFF=&lt;bit</b> <b>combination&gt;</b>

             To control chip attachment balancing between the ncr driver and this driver:
             <b>options</b> <b>SYM_SETUP_LP_PROBE_MAP=&lt;bit</b> <b>combination&gt;</b>

       Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             sym_load="YES"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This driver provides support for the Symbios/LSI Logic 53C8XX PCI SCSI controllers.

       Driver features include support for wide SCSI busses and fast10, fast20, fast40 and fast80-dt synchronous
       data  transfers  depending  on  controller  capabilities.  It also provides generic SCSI features such as
       tagged command queueing and auto-request sense.  This driver is configured by default for  a  maximum  of
       446  outstanding  commands per bus, 8 LUNs per target and 64 tagged tasks per LUN.  These numbers are not
       so much limited by design as they are considered reasonable values for current  SCSI  technology.   These
       values can be increased by changing appropriate constants in driver header files (not recommended).

       This  driver  supports  the  entire  Symbios  53C8XX  family of PCI SCSI controllers.  It also offers the
       advantage of architectural improvements available only with newer chips.

       <b>sym</b> notably handles phase mismatch from SCRIPTS for the 53C896, 53C895A, and 53C1010 cores.  As a result,
       it guarantees that no more than 1 interrupt per IO completion is delivered  to  the  CPU,  and  that  the
       SCRIPTS processor is never stalled waiting for CPU attention in normal situations.

       <b>sym</b> also uses LOAD/STORE SCRIPTS instructions for chips that support it.  Only the early 810, 815 and 825
       NCR  chips  do not support LOAD/STORE.  Use of LOAD/STORE instead of MEMORY MOVE allows SCRIPTS to access
       IO registers internal to the chip (no external PCI cycles).  As a result, the driver guarantees  that  no
       PCI self-mastering will occur for chips that support LOAD/STORE.

       LOAD/STORE  instructions  are  also faster than MEMORY MOVE because they do not involve the chip DMA FIFO
       and are coded on 2 DWORDs instead of 3.

       For the early NCR 810, 815 and 825 chips, the driver uses a separate SCRIPTS set that  uses  MEMORY  MOVE
       instructions for data movements.  This is because LOAD/STORE are not supported by these chips.

       HVD/LVD  capable  controllers  (895, 895A, 896, and 897) report the actual bus mode in the STEST4 chip IO
       registers.  This feature allows the driver to safely probe against bus  mode  and  to  set  up  the  chip
       accordingly.   By default the driver only supports HVD for these chips.  For other chips that can support
       HVD but not LVD, the driver has to probe implementation dependent registers (GPIO) in order to detect HVD
       bus mode.  Only HVD implementations that conform with Symbios Logic recommendations can  be  detected  by
       the  driver.   When  the <u>SYM_SETUP_SCSI_DIFF</u> kernel option is assigned a value of 1, the driver will also
       probe against HVD for 825a, 875, 876 and 885 chips, assuming Symbios Logic compatible  implementation  of
       HVD.

       When  the  <u>SYM_SETUP_PCI_PARITY</u>  is assigned a value of 0, the driver will not enable PCI parity checking
       for 53C8XX devices.  PCI parity checking should not be an option  for  PCI  SCSI  controllers,  but  some
       systems  have  been  reported  to fail using 53C8XX chips, due to spurious or permanent PCI parity errors
       detected.  This option is supplied for convenience but it is neither recommended nor supported.

       The generic <u><a href="../man4/ncr.4.html">ncr</a></u>(4) driver also supports SYM53C8XX based PCI SCSI controllers, except for the  SYM53C1010,
       which is only supported by the <b>sym</b> driver.

       By default, when both the <u><a href="../man4/ncr.4.html">ncr</a></u>(4) and <b>sym</b> drivers are configured, the <b>sym</b> driver takes precedence over the
       <u><a href="../man4/ncr.4.html">ncr</a></u>(4)  driver.   The user can indicate a balancing of chip types between the two drivers by defining the
       <u>SYM_SETUP_LP_PROBE_MAP</u> kernel configuration option as follows:

       <u>Bit</u>     <u>Devices</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>attached</u> <u>by</u> <u>ncr</u> <u>instead</u>
       0x01    53C810a, 53C860
       0x02    53C825a, 53C875, 53C876, 53C885, 53C895
       0x04    53C895a, 53C896, 53C897, 53C1510d
       0x40    53C810, 53C815, 53C825

       For example, if <u>SYM_SETUP_LP_PROBE_MAP</u> is supplied with the value 0x41, the <u><a href="../man4/ncr.4.html">ncr</a></u>(4) driver will attach  to
       53C810,  53C815,  53C825,  53C810a,  and  53C860 based controllers, and the <b>sym</b> driver will attach to all
       other 53C8XX based controllers.

       When only the <b>sym</b> driver is configured, the <u>SYM_SETUP_LP_PROBE_MAP</u> option has no effect.  Thus,  in  this
       case, the <b>sym</b> driver will attach all 53C8XX based controllers present in the system.

       This  driver  offers  other  options  that  are not currently exported to the user.  They are defined and
       documented in the <u>sym_conf.h</u> driver file.  Changing these options is not  recommended  unless  absolutely
       necessary.  Some of these options are planned to be exported through <u><a href="../man3/sysctl.3.html">sysctl</a></u>(3) or an equivalent mechanism
       in a future driver releases and therefore, no compatibility is guaranteed.

       At  initialization,  the  driver  tries  to  detect  and  read  user settings from controller NVRAM.  The
       Symbios/Logic NVRAM layout and the Tekram NVRAM layout are currently supported.  If the  reading  of  the
       NVRAM succeeds, the following settings are taken into account and reported to CAM:

       <u>Host</u> <u>settings</u>           <u>Symbios</u>    <u>Tekram</u>
       SCSI parity checking    Y          N
       Host SCSI ident         Y          Y
       Verbose messages        Y          N
       Scan targets hi-lo      Y          N
       Avoid SCSI bus reset    Y          N

       <u>Device</u> <u>settings</u>       <u>Symbios</u>    <u>Tekram</u>
       Synchronous period    Y          Y
       SCSI bus width        Y          Y
       Queue tag enable      Y          Y
       Number of tags        NA         Y
       Disconnect enable     Y          Y
       Scan at boot time     Y          N
       Scan LUN              Y          N

       Devices  that are configured as disabled for 'scan' in the NVRAM are not reported to CAM at system start-
       up.  They can be discovered later using the ‘camcontrol rescan’ command.
