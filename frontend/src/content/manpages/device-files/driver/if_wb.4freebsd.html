</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wb — Winbond W89C840F Fast Ethernet device driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>device</b> <b>miibus</b>
             <b>device</b> <b>wb</b>

       Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             if_wb_load="YES"

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATION</b> <b>NOTICE</b></h4><pre>
       The      <b>wb</b>     driver     is     not     present     in     FreeBSD     13.0     and     later.      See
       https://github.com/freebsd/fcp/blob/master/fcp-0101.md for more information.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>wb</b> driver provides support for PCI Ethernet adapters and embedded controllers based  on  the  Winbond
       W89C840F  Fast  Ethernet  controller  chip.   The  840F should not be confused with the 940F, which is an
       NE2000 clone and only supports 10Mbps speeds.

       The Winbond controller uses bus master DMA and is designed to be a DEC  'tulip'  workalike.   It  differs
       from  the  standard DEC design in several ways: the control and status registers are spaced 4 bytes apart
       instead of 8, and the receive filter is programmed through registers rather than by downloading a special
       setup frame via the transmit DMA engine.  Using an external PHY, the Winbond chip supports  both  10  and
       100Mbps speeds in either full or half duplex.

       The <b>wb</b> driver supports the following media types:

       autoselect            Enable  autoselection of the media type and options.  This is only supported if the
                             PHY chip attached to the Winbond controller  supports  NWAY  autonegotiation.   The
                             user  can  manually  override  the autoselected mode by adding media options to the
                             <u>/etc/rc.conf</u> file.

       10baseT/UTP           Set 10Mbps operation.  The <u>mediaopt</u> option  can  also  be  used  to  select  either
                             <u>full-duplex</u> or <u>half-duplex</u> modes.

       100baseTX             Set  100Mbps  (Fast  Ethernet)  operation.  The <u>mediaopt</u> option can also be used to
                             select either <u>full-duplex</u> or <u>half-duplex</u> modes.

       The <b>wb</b> driver supports the following media options:

       full-duplex           Force full duplex operation.

       half-duplex           Force half duplex operation.

       Note that the 100baseTX media type is only available if supported by the adapter.  For  more  information
       on configuring this device, see <u><a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a></u>(8).

</pre><h4><b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>wb</b> driver supports Winbond W89C840F based Fast Ethernet adapters and embedded controllers including:

       <b>•</b>   Trendware TE100-PCIE

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wb%d:</b> <b>couldn't</b> <b>map</b> <b>memory</b>  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

       <b>wb%d:</b> <b>couldn't</b> <b>map</b> <b>interrupt</b>  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

       <b>wb%d:</b>  <b>watchdog</b> <b>timeout</b>  The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with the
       network connection (cable).

       <b>wb%d:</b> <b>no</b> <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> <b>rx</b> <b>list</b>  The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.

       <b>wb%d:</b> <b>no</b> <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> <b>tx</b> <b>list</b>  The driver failed  to  allocate  an  mbuf  for  the  transmitter  ring  when
       allocating a pad buffer or collapsing an mbuf chain into a cluster.

       <b>wb%d:</b>  <b>chip</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>in</b>  <b>D3</b> <b>power</b> <b>state</b> <b>--</b> <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>D0</b>  This message applies only to adapters which support
       power management.  Some operating systems place the controller in low power mode when shutting down,  and
       some PCI BIOSes fail to bring the chip out of this state before configuring it.  The controller loses all
       of its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if the BIOS does not set it back to full power mode in time,
       it  will  not be able to configure it correctly.  The driver tries to detect this condition and bring the
       adapter back to the D0 (full power) state, but this may not be enough to return the  driver  to  a  fully
       operational condition.  If you see this message at boot time and the driver fails to attach the device as
       a network interface, you will have to perform second warm boot to have the device properly configured.

       Note  that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another operating system.  If you power down
       your system prior to booting FreeBSD, the card should be configured correctly.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>wb</b> device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 3.0.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>wb</b> driver was written by Bill Paul &lt;<u><a href="mailto:wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu">wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu</a></u>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The Winbond chip seems to behave strangely in some cases when the link partner switches  modes.   If  for
       example  both  sides  are set to 10Mbps half-duplex, and the other end is changed to 100Mbps full-duplex,
       the Winbond's receiver suddenly starts writing trash all over the RX descriptors.  The <b>wb</b> driver  handles
       this by forcing a reset of both the controller chip and attached PHY.  This is drastic, but it appears to
       be the only way to recover properly from this condition.
