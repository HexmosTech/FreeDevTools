</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       iicmux — I2C bus mulitiplexer framework

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>device</b> <b>iicmux</b>

       Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             iicmux_load="YES"

       Note  that  it  is  usually  not  necessary  to  explicitly  load the driver module, as it will be loaded
       automatically along with the driver for the specific mux hardware in use.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>iicmux</b> framework provides support code to help implement drivers  for  various  I2C  bus  multiplexer
       (mux)  hardware.   <b>iicmux</b>  is not a standalone driver, it is a collection of support functions and driver
       methods which are used by individual mux hardware drivers.  It will be loaded automatically  when  needed
       by  a  mux  hardware  driver.   This  manual  page  provides an overview of the I2C mux framework and its
       behavior.

       Generally speaking, an I2C mux is connected to an upstream I2C bus, and to one  or  more  downstream  I2C
       buses,  and  it  can  be  commanded to connect any one of the downstream buses to the upstream bus.  Some
       hardware may be able to connect multiple downstream buses at the same  time,  but  that  concept  is  not
       supported by <b>iicmux</b>.

       The <b>iicmux</b> framework operates automatically when I2C slave devices initiate I/O.  It does not require (or
       even allow for) any external control to select the active downstream bus.

       When  there  is no I/O in progress, the mux is said to be in the “idle” state.  Some mux hardware has the
       ability to disconnect all downstream buses when in an idle state.  Other hardware must always have one of
       the downstream buses connected.  Individual mux hardware drivers typically provide a way to select  which
       downstream  bus  (if  any)  should  be  connected  while  in  the  idle  state.   In  the absence of such
       configuration, whichever downstream bus was last used remains connected to the upstream bus.

       When an I2C slave device on a bus downstream of a mux initiates I/O, it first requests exclusive  use  of
       the  bus by calling <b>iicbus_request_bus</b>().  This request is communicated to the bus's parent, which is the
       <b>iicmux</b> framework mux driver.  Once exclusive bus ownership is  obtained,  the  mux  driver  connects  the
       upstream  I2C  bus  to the downstream bus which hosts the slave device that requested bus ownership.  The
       mux  hardware  maintains  that  upstream-to-downstream  connection   until   the   slave   device   calls
       <b>iicbus_release_bus</b>().   Before  releasing  ownership, the mux driver returns the mux hardware to the idle
       state.

</pre><h4><b>FDT</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       On an <u><a href="../man4/fdt.4.html">fdt</a></u>(4) based system, an I2C mux device node is defined as a child node of its upstream I2C bus when
       the mux device is an I2C slave itself.  It may be defined as a child node of any other bus or  device  in
       the  system  when  it is not an I2C slave, in which case the <u>i2c-parent</u> property indicates which upstream
       bus the mux is attached to.  In either case, the children of the mux node are additional I2C buses, which
       will have one or more I2C slave devices described in their child nodes.

       Drivers using the <b>iicmux</b> framework conform to the standard <b>i2c/i2c-mux.txt</b> bindings document.

</pre><h4><b>HINTS</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       On a <u><a href="../man5/device.hints.5.html">device.hints</a></u>(5) based system, these values are configurable for <b>iicmux</b> framework drivers :

       <u>hint.&lt;driver&gt;.&lt;unit&gt;.at</u>
               The upstream <u><a href="../man4/iicbus.4.html">iicbus</a></u>(4) the <b>iicmux</b> instance is attached to.

       When configured via hints, the driver automatically adds an iicbus  instance  for  every  downstream  bus
       supported by the chip.  There is currently no way to indicate used versus unused downstream buses.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>iicmux</b> framework first appeared in FreeBSD 13.0.
