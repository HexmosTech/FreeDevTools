       ath — Atheros IEEE 802.11 wireless network driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>device</b> <b>ath</b>
             <b>device</b> <b>ath_pci</b>
             <b>device</b> <b>ath_hal</b>
             <b>options</b> <b>AH_SUPPORT_AR5416</b>
             <b>device</b> <b>ath_rate_sample</b>
             <b>device</b> <b>wlan</b>

       Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             if_ath_load="YES"
             if_ath_pci_load="YES"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ath</b>  driver  provides  support  for  wireless  network adapters based on the Atheros AR5210, AR5211,
       AR5212, AR5416 and AR9300 programming APIs.  These APIs are used by a wide variety  of  chips;  most  all
       chips with a PCI, PCIe and/or CardBus interface are supported.

       Supported features include 802.11 and 802.3 frames, power management, BSS, IBSS, MBSS, WDS/DWDS TDMA, and
       host-based access point operation modes.  All host/device interaction is via DMA.

       Please  note  that  from  FreeBSD-9.0,  the  <b>ath</b> driver does not include the PCI/PCIe bus glue.  The same
       driver supports multiple underlying bus types, including PCI/PCIe, but also embedded (AHB) and USB in the
       future.

       To enable use for PCI/PCIe systems, see the <u><a href="../man4/ath_pci.4.html">ath_pci</a></u>(4) driver.  For embedded systems which use the AHB to
       connect the wireless MAC, see the <u><a href="../man4/ath_ahb.4.html">ath_ahb</a></u>(4) driver.

       The <b>ath</b> driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames, however it can receive either 802.11
       or 802.3 frames.  Transmit speed and operating mode is selectable and depends on  the  specific  chipset.
       AR5210-based  devices support 802.11a operation with transmit speeds of 6 Mbps, 9 Mbps, 12 Mbps, 18 Mbps,
       24 Mbps, 36 Mbps, 48 Mbps, and 54 Mbps.  AR5211-based devices support 802.11a and 802.11b operation  with
       transmit  speeds  as  above  for  802.11a  operation  and  1Mbps,  2Mbps, 5.5 Mbps and 11Mbps for 802.11b
       operation.  AR5212-based devices support 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g  operation  with  transmit  speeds
       appropriate  to  each.  AR5416 and later class devices are capable of 802.11n operation.  Most chips also
       support an Atheros Turbo Mode (TM) that operates in the 5GHz frequency range with 2x the transmit speeds.
       Some chips also support Turbo mode in the 2.4GHz range with 802.11g though this support is not  presently
       available  due  to regulatory requirements.  (Note that Turbo modes are, however, only interoperable with
       other Atheros-based devices.)  AR5212-based and AR5416-based  devices  also  support  half-  (10MHz)  and
       quarter-width  (5MHz)  channels.   The  actual transmit speed used is dependent on signal quality and the
       “rate control” algorithm employed by the driver.  All chips support WEP encryption.  AR5212,  AR5416  and
       later  parts  have  hardware support for the AES-CCM, TKIP, and Michael cryptographic operations required
       for WPA.  To enable encryption, use <u><a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a></u>(8) as shown below.

       The driver supports <b>station</b>, <b>adhoc</b>, <b>adhoc-demo</b>, <b>hostap</b>, <b>mesh</b>, <b>wds</b>, and <b>monitor</b> mode operation.   Multiple
       <b>hostap</b>  virtual interfaces may be configured for simultaneous use on cards that use a 5212 or later part.
       When multiple interfaces are configured each may have a separate mac address that is  formed  by  setting
       the  U/L bits in the mac address assigned to the underlying device.  Any number of <b>wds</b> virtual interfaces
       may be configured together with <b>hostap</b> interfaces.  Multiple <b>station</b> interfaces may be operated  together
       with  <b>hostap</b>  interfaces to construct a wireless repeater device.  The driver also support <b>tdma</b> operation
       when compiled with <b>options</b> <b>IEEE80211_SUPPORT_TDMA</b> (which also enables the required 802.11 support).   For
       more information on configuring this device, see <u><a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a></u>(8).

       Devices  supported  by  the  <b>ath</b>  driver  come  in Cardbus, ExpressCard, Mini-PCI and Mini-PCIe packages.
       Wireless cards in Cardbus and ExpressCard slots may be inserted and ejected on the fly.

</pre><h4><b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ath</b> driver supports all Atheros Cardbus, ExpressCard, PCI and PCIe cards, except those that are based
       on the AR5005VL chipset.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Join a specific BSS network with WEP encryption:

             ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev ath0
             ifconfig wlan0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \
                     wepmode on wepkey 0x8736639624

       Join/create an 802.11b IBSS network with network name “<b>my_net</b>”:

             ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev ath0 wlanmode adhoc
             ifconfig wlan0 inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \
                     mode 11b

       Create an 802.11g host-based access point:

             ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev ath0 wlanmode hostap
             ifconfig wlan0 inet 192.168.0.10 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_ap \
                     mode 11g

                     ssid tdma-test tmdaslot 0 tdmaslotlen 2500 \
                     channel 36 up

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ath%d:</b>  <b>unable</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>attach</b>  <b>hardware;</b>  <b>HAL</b>  <b>status</b>  <b>%u</b>    The Atheros Hardware Access Layer was unable to
       configure  the  hardware  as  requested.   The  status  code  is  explained  in  the  HAL  include   file
       <u>sys/dev/ath/ath_hal/ah.h</u>.

       <b>ath%d:</b>  <b>failed</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>allocate</b> <b>descriptors:</b> <b>%d</b>  The driver was unable to allocate contiguous memory for the
       transmit and receive descriptors.  This usually indicates system memory is scarce and/or fragmented.

       <b>ath%d:</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>setup</b> <b>a</b> <b>data</b> <b>xmit</b> <b>queue!</b>  The request to the HAL to set up the transmit queue for normal
       data frames failed.  This should not happen.

       <b>ath%d:</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>setup</b> <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> <b>xmit</b> <b>queue!</b>  The request to the HAL to set  up  the  transmit  queue  for
       802.11 beacon frames failed.  This should not happen.

       <b>ath%d:</b> <b>802.11</b> <b>address:</b> <b>%s</b>  The MAC address programmed in the EEPROM is displayed.

       <b>ath%d:</b>  <b>hardware</b>  <b>error;</b> <b>resetting</b>  An unrecoverable error in the hardware occurred.  Errors of this sort
       include unrecoverable DMA errors.  The driver will reset the hardware and continue.

       <b>ath%d:</b> <b>rx</b> <b>FIFO</b> <b>overrun;</b> <b>resetting</b>  The receive FIFO in the hardware overflowed before the data  could  be
       transferred to the host.  This typically occurs because the hardware ran short of receive descriptors and
       had no place to transfer received data.  The driver will reset the hardware and continue.

       <b>ath%d:</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> <b>hardware;</b> <b>hal</b> <b>status</b> <b>%u</b>  The Atheros Hardware Access Layer was unable to reset the
       hardware  as  requested.   The status code is explained in the HAL include file <u>sys/dev/ath/ath_hal/ah.h</u>.
       This should not happen.

       <b>ath%d:</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>recv</b> <b>logic</b>  The driver was unable to restart frame  reception.   This  should  not
       happen.

       <b>ath%d:</b> <b>device</b> <b>timeout</b>  A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did not complete in time.  The
       driver will reset the hardware and continue.  This should not happen.

       <b>ath%d:</b>  <b>bogus</b> <b>xmit</b> <b>rate</b> <b>0x%x</b>  An invalid transmit rate was specified for an outgoing frame.  The frame is
       discarded.  This should not happen.

       <b>ath%d:</b> <b>ath_chan_set:</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>reset</b> <b>channel</b> <b>%u</b> <b>(%u</b> <b>MHz)</b>  The Atheros Hardware Access Layer was unable to
       reset the hardware when switching channels during scanning.  This should not happen.

       <b>ath%d:</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enable</b> <b>memory</b> <b>mapping</b>  The driver was unable to enable  memory-mapped  I/O  to  the  PCI
       device registers.  This should not happen.

       <b>ath%d:</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enable</b> <b>bus</b> <b>mastering</b>  The driver was unable to enable the device as a PCI bus master for
       doing DMA.  This should not happen.

       <b>ath%d:</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>map</b> <b>register</b> <b>space</b>  The driver was unable to map the device registers into the host address
       space.  This should not happen.

       <b>ath%d:</b>  <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>map</b> <b>interrupt</b>  The driver was unable to allocate an IRQ for the device interrupt.  This
       should not happen.

       <b>ath%d:</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>establish</b> <b>interrupt</b>  The driver was unable to  install  the  device  interrupt  handler.
       This should not happen.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ath</b> device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 5.2.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Revision A1 of the D-LINK DWL-G520 and DWL-G650 are based  on  an  Intersil  PrismGT  chip  and  are  not
       supported by this driver.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The driver does supports optional station mode power-save operation.

       The  AR5210 can only do WEP in hardware; consequently hardware assisted WEP is disabled in order to allow
       software implementations of TKIP and CCMP to function.  Hardware WEP can be re-enabled by  modifying  the
       driver.
