</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ep — Ethernet driver for 3Com Etherlink III (3c5x9) interfaces

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>device</b> <b>ep</b>

       Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             if_ep_load="YES"

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATION</b> <b>NOTICE</b></h4><pre>
       The      <b>ep</b>     driver     is     not     present     in     FreeBSD     13.0     and     later.      See
       https://github.com/freebsd/fcp/blob/master/fcp-0101.md for more information.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ep</b> device driver supports network adapters based on the 3Com 3C5x9  Etherlink  III  Parallel  Tasking
       chipset.

       Various models of these cards come with a different assortment of connectors:

       AUI/DIX               Standard 15 pin connector, also known as 10base5 (thick-net)

       10Base2               BNC, also known as thin-net

       10BaseT               UTP, also known as twisted pair

       The default port to use is the port that has been selected with the setup utility.  To override this, use
       the following media options with <u><a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a></u>(8) or in your <u>/etc/rc.conf</u> file.

       10base5/AUI           Use the AUI port.

       10base2/BNC           Use the BNC port.

       10baseT/UTP           Use the UTP port.

</pre><h4><b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>

       <b>•</b>   3Com OfficeConnect 3CXSH572BT, 3CCSH572BT PCMCIA
       <b>•</b>   Farallon EtherWave and EtherMac PC Card (P/n 595/895 with BLUE arrow)

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The 3c509 card has no jumpers to set the address.  3Com supplies software to set the address of the  card
       in software.  To find the card on the ISA bus, the kernel performs a complex scan operation at IO address
       0x110.  Beware!  Avoid placing other cards at that address!

       Furthermore, the 3c509 should not be configured in EISA mode.

       Cards  in  PnP  mode  may  conflict  with  other resources in the system.  Ensure your BIOS is configured
       correctly to exclude resources used by the 3c509, especially IRQs, to avoid unpredictable behavior.

       Many different companies sold the 3Com PC Cards under their own private label.  These cards also work.

       The Farallon EtherWave and EtherMac card came in two varieties.  The <b>ep</b> driver supports the 595  and  895
       cards.   These  cards  have the blue arrow on the front along with a 3Com logo.  The Farallon 595a cards,
       which have a red arrow on the front, are also called EtherWave and EtherMac.  They are supported  by  the
       <u><a href="../man4/sn.4.html">sn</a></u>(4) driver.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ep0:</b>  <b>reset</b>  <b>(status:</b>  <b>%x)</b>  The driver has encountered a FIFO underrun or overrun.  The driver will reset
       the card and the packet will be lost.  This is not fatal.

       <b>ep0:</b> <b>eeprom</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>ready</b>  The eeprom failed to come ready.   This  probably  means  the  card  is
       wedged.

       <b>ep0:</b>  <b>3c509</b>  <b>in</b>  <b>test</b>  <b>mode.</b> <b>Erase</b> <b>pencil</b> <b>mark!</b>  This means that someone has scribbled with pencil in the
       test area on the card.  Erase the pencil mark and reboot.  (This is not a joke).

       <b>ep0:</b> <b>No</b> <b>I/O</b> <b>space?!</b>  The driver was unable to allocate the I/O space that  it  thinks  should  be  there.
       Look for conflicts with other devices.

       <b>ep0:</b>  <b>No</b>  <b>irq?!</b>    The  driver  could not allocate the interrupt it wanted.  Look for conflicts, although
       sharing interrupts for PC Card is normal.

       <b>ep0:</b> <b>No</b> <b>connectors!</b>  The driver queried the hardware for what ethernet attachment were present,  but  the
       hardware reported none that the driver recognized.

       <b>ep0:</b> <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>Ethernet</b> <b>address!</b>  The driver was unable to read the ethernet address from the EEPROM.
       This is likely the result of the card being wedged.

       <b>ep0:</b>  <b>if_alloc()</b>  <b>failed</b>    The  driver  was  unable  to  allocate a ifnet structure.  This may happen in
       extremely low memory conditions.

       <b>ep0:</b> <b>strange</b> <b>connector</b> <b>type</b> <b>in</b> <b>EEPROM:</b> <b>assuming</b> <b>AUI</b>  The driver  does  not  know  what  to  do  with  the
       information the EEPROM has about connectors, so it is assuming the worst.

       <b>ep0:</b>  <b>unknown</b> <b>ID</b> <b>0xXXXXXXXX</b>  The driver has found an ID that it believes it supports, but does not have a
       specific identification string to present to the user.

       <b>ep0:</b> <b>&lt;%s&gt;</b> <b>at</b> <b>port</b> <b>0x%03x</b> <b>in</b> <b>EISA</b> <b>mode,</b> <b>ignored.</b>  The 3C509 ISA card is in EISA mode.  The  card  will  be
       ignored until it is taken out of EISA mode.

       <b>ep0:</b>  <b>&lt;%s&gt;</b>  <b>at</b> <b>x0%03x</b> <b>in</b> <b>PnP</b> <b>mode</b>  This card appears to be in Plug and Play mode.  It should be probed as
       part of the plug and play phase of the ISA probes.

       <b>ep0:</b> <b>Invalid</b> <b>EEPROM</b> <b>checksum!</b>  The EEPROM has a bad checksum, so the driver is ignoring the card.

       <b>ep0:</b> <b>bus_setup_intr()</b> <b>failed!</b>  The driver was unable to setup the interrupt handler.  This  should  never
       happen.
