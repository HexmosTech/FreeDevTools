       rl — RealTek 8129/8139 Fast Ethernet device driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>device</b> <b>miibus</b>
             <b>device</b> <b>rl</b>

       Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             if_rl_load="YES"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>rl</b>  driver  provides support for PCI Ethernet adapters and embedded controllers based on the RealTek
       8129 and 8139 Fast Ethernet controller chips.

       The RealTek 8129/8139 series controllers use bus master DMA  but  do  not  use  a  descriptor-based  data
       transfer  mechanism.  The receiver uses a single fixed size ring buffer from which packets must be copied
       into mbufs.  For transmission, there are only four outbound packet address registers  which  require  all
       outgoing  packets  to  be  stored  as  contiguous  buffers.  Furthermore, outbound packet buffers must be
       longword aligned or else transmission will fail.

       The 8129 differs from the 8139 in that the 8139 has an internal PHY which is controlled  through  special
       direct  access registers whereas the 8129 uses an external PHY via an MII bus.  The 8139 supports both 10
       and 100Mbps speeds in either full or half duplex.  The 8129 can support the same speeds and  modes  given
       an appropriate PHY chip.

       Note: support for the 8139C+ chip is provided by the <u><a href="../man4/re.4.html">re</a></u>(4) driver.

       The <b>rl</b> driver supports the following media types:

       autoselect            Enable  autoselection of the media type and options.  This is only supported if the
                             PHY chip attached to the RealTek controller  supports  NWAY  autonegotiation.   The
                             user  can  manually  override  the autoselected mode by adding media options to the
                             <u>/etc/rc.conf</u> file.

       10baseT/UTP           Set 10Mbps operation.  The <u>mediaopt</u> option  can  also  be  used  to  select  either
                             <u>full-duplex</u> or <u>half-duplex</u> modes.

       100baseTX             Set  100Mbps  (Fast  Ethernet)  operation.  The <u>mediaopt</u> option can also be used to
                             select either <u>full-duplex</u> or <u>half-duplex</u> modes.

       The <b>rl</b> driver supports the following media options:

       full-duplex           Force full duplex operation.

       half-duplex           Force half duplex operation.

       Note that the 100baseTX media type is only available if supported by the adapter.  For  more  information
       on configuring this device, see <u><a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a></u>(8).

</pre><h4><b>LOADER</b> <b>TUNABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>dev.rl.%unit.prefer_iomap</u>
               This  tunable controls which register mapping should be used on the specified device.  A non-zero
               value enables I/O space register mapping.  For  controllers  that  have  no  I/O  space  register
               mapping  this tunable should be set to 0 to use memory space register mapping.  The default value
               is 1 to use I/O space register mapping.

       <u>dev.rl.%unit.twister_enable</u>
               Non-zero value enables the long cable tuning on the specified device.  Disabled by default.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rl%d:</b> <b>couldn't</b> <b>map</b> <b>memory</b>  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

       <b>rl%d:</b> <b>couldn't</b> <b>map</b> <b>interrupt</b>  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

       <b>rl%d:</b> <b>watchdog</b> <b>timeout</b>  The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with  the
       network connection (cable).

       <b>rl%d:</b> <b>no</b> <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> <b>rx</b> <b>list</b>  The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.

       <b>rl%d:</b>  <b>no</b>  <b>memory</b>  <b>for</b>  <b>tx</b>  <b>list</b>    The  driver  failed to allocate an mbuf for the transmitter ring when
       allocating a pad buffer or collapsing an mbuf chain into a cluster.

       <b>rl%d:</b> <b>chip</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>D3</b> <b>power</b> <b>state</b> <b>--</b> <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>D0</b>  This message applies only  to  adapters  which  support
       power  management.  Some operating systems place the controller in low power mode when shutting down, and
       some PCI BIOSes fail to bring the chip out of this state before configuring it.  The controller loses all
       of its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if the BIOS does not set it back to full power mode in time,
       it will not be able to configure it correctly.  The driver tries to detect this condition and  bring  the
       adapter  back  to  the  D0 (full power) state, but this may not be enough to return the driver to a fully
       operational condition.  If you see this message at boot time and the driver fails to attach the device as
       a network interface, you will have to perform second warm boot to have the device properly configured.

       Note that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another operating system.  If you power  down
       your system prior to booting FreeBSD, the card should be configured correctly.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>rl</b> device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 3.0.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>rl</b> driver was written by Bill Paul &lt;<u><a href="mailto:wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu">wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu</a></u>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Since  outbound  packets  must  be longword aligned, the transmit routine has to copy an unaligned packet
       into an mbuf cluster buffer before transmission.  The driver abuses the fact that the cluster buffer pool
       is allocated at system startup time in a contiguous region starting at a page  boundary.   Since  cluster
       buffers  are  2048  bytes,  they  are  longword aligned by definition.  The driver probably should not be
       depending on this characteristic.

       The RealTek data sheets are of especially poor quality,  and  there  is  a  lot  of  information  missing
       particularly  concerning  the  receiver  operation.  One particularly important fact that the data sheets
       fail to mention relates to the way in which the chip fills in the receive buffer.  When an  interrupt  is
       posted  to  signal  that  a  frame  has  been received, it is possible that another frame might be in the
       process of being copied into the receive buffer while the driver is busy handling the first one.  If  the
       driver  manages  to finish processing the first frame before the chip is done DMAing the rest of the next
       frame, the driver may attempt to process the next frame in the buffer before the chip has had a chance to
       finish DMAing all of it.

       The driver can check for an incomplete frame by inspecting the frame length in the header  preceding  the
       actual packet data: an incomplete frame will have the magic length of 0xFFF0.  When the driver encounters
       this value, it knows that it has finished processing all currently available packets.  Neither this magic
       value nor its significance are documented anywhere in the RealTek data sheets.
