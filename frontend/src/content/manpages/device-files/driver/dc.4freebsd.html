</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dc — DEC/Intel 21143 and clone 10/100 Ethernet driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>device</b> <b>miibus</b>
             <b>device</b> <b>dc</b>

       Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             if_dc_load="YES"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>dc</b>  driver provides support for several PCI Fast Ethernet adapters and embedded controllers based on
       the DEC/Intel 21143 chipset and clones.

       All of supported chipsets have the same general register layout, DMA  descriptor  format  and  method  of
       operation.   All  of the clone chips are based on the 21143 design with various modifications.  The 21143
       itself has support for 10baseT, BNC, AUI, MII and symbol media attachments, 10 and 100Mbps speeds in full
       or half duplex, built in NWAY autonegotiation and wake on LAN.  The 21143  also  offers  several  receive
       filter  programming  options  including  perfect  filtering,  inverse  perfect  filtering  and hash table
       filtering.

       Some clone chips duplicate the 21143 fairly closely while others only maintain superficial  similarities.
       Some  support  only  MII media attachments.  Others use different receiver filter programming mechanisms.
       At least  one  supports  only  chained  DMA  descriptors  (most  support  both  chained  descriptors  and
       contiguously allocated fixed size rings).  Some chips (especially the PNIC) also have peculiar bugs.  The
       <b>dc</b> driver does its best to provide generalized support for all of these chipsets in order to keep special
       case code to a minimum.

       These chips are used by many vendors which makes it difficult to provide a complete list of all supported
       cards.

       The <b>dc</b> driver supports the following media types:

       <b>autoselect</b>   Enable  autoselection  of  the  media  type and options.  The user can manually override the
                    autoselected mode by adding media options to the <u>/etc/rc.conf</u> file.

                    Note: the built-in NWAY autonegotiation on the original PNIC 82c168 chip is horribly  broken
                    and  is  not  supported  by the <b>dc</b> driver at this time (see the “BUGS” section for details).
                    The original 82c168 appears on very early revisions  of  the  LinkSys  LNE100TX  and  Matrox
                    FastNIC.

       <b>10baseT/UTP</b>  Set 10Mbps operation.  The <b>mediaopt</b> option can also be used to enable <b>full-duplex</b> operation.
                    Not specifying <b>full-duplex</b> implies <b>half-duplex</b> mode.

       <b>100baseTX</b>    Set  100Mbps  (Fast  Ethernet)  operation.   The  <b>mediaopt</b> option can also be used to enable
                    <b>full-duplex</b> operation.  Not specifying <b>full-duplex</b> implies <b>half-duplex</b> mode.

       The <b>dc</b> driver supports the following media options:

       <b>full-duplex</b>  Force full duplex operation.  The interface will operate in half duplex mode if  this  media
                    option is not specified.

       Note  that  the  100baseTX  media type may not be available on certain Intel 21143 adapters which support
       10Mbps media attachments only.  For more information on configuring this device, see <u><a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a></u>(8).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       On sparc64 the <b>dc</b> driver respects the <u>local-mac-address?</u> system configuration variable for the  built  in
       Sun  DMFE  10/100  Mbps Ethernet interfaces on Sun Netra X1 and Sun Fire V100.  This system configuration
       variable can be set in the Open Firmware boot monitor using the <b>setenv</b> command or by <u><a href="../man8/eeprom.8.html">eeprom</a></u>(8).   If  set
       to  “<b>false</b>”  (the default), the <b>dc</b> driver will use the system's default MAC address for both of the built
       in devices.  If set to “<b>true</b>”, the unique MAC address of each interface is used rather than the  system's
       default MAC address.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dc%d:</b> <b>couldn't</b> <b>map</b> <b>ports/memory</b>  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

       <b>dc%d:</b> <b>couldn't</b> <b>map</b> <b>interrupt</b>  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

       <b>dc%d:</b>  <b>watchdog</b>  <b>timeout</b>  A packet was queued for transmission and a transmit command was issued, but the
       device failed to acknowledge the transmission before a timeout expired.  This can happen if the device is
       unable to deliver interrupts for some reason, of if there is a problem with the network connection (cable
       or network equipment) that results in a loss of link.

       <b>dc%d:</b> <b>no</b> <b>memory</b> <b>for</b> <b>rx</b> <b>list</b>  The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.

       <b>dc%d:</b> <b>TX</b> <b>underrun</b> <b>--</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>TX</b> <b>threshold</b>  The  device  generated  a  transmit  underrun  error  while
       attempting  to  DMA  and  transmit a packet.  This happens if the host is not able to DMA the packet data
       into the NIC's FIFO fast enough.  The driver will dynamically increase the transmit  start  threshold  so
       that more data must be DMAed into the FIFO before the NIC will start transmitting it onto the wire.

       <b>dc%d:</b>  <b>TX</b>  <b>underrun</b>  <b>--</b> <b>using</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> <b>forward</b> <b>mode</b>  The device continued to generate transmit underruns
       even after all possible transmit start threshold settings had been tried, so the  driver  programmed  the
       chip  for  store  and  forward  mode.  In this mode, the NIC will not begin transmission until the entire
       packet has been transferred into its FIFO memory.

       <b>dc%d:</b> <b>chip</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>D3</b> <b>power</b> <b>state</b> <b>--</b> <b>setting</b> <b>to</b> <b>D0</b>  This message applies only  to  adapters  which  support
       power  management.  Some operating systems place the controller in low power mode when shutting down, and
       some PCI BIOSes fail to bring the chip out of this state before configuring it.  The controller loses all
       of its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if the BIOS does not set it back to full power mode in time,
       it will not be able to configure it correctly.  The driver tries to detect this condition and  bring  the
       adapter  back  to  the  D0 (full power) state, but this may not be enough to return the driver to a fully
       operational condition.  If you see this message at boot time and the driver fails to attach the device as
       a network interface, you will have to perform a second warm boot to have the device properly configured.

       Note that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another operating system.  If you power  down
       your system prior to booting FreeBSD, the card should be configured correctly.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>dc</b> device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 4.0.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>dc</b> driver was written by Bill Paul &lt;<u><a href="mailto:wpaul@ee.columbia.edu">wpaul@ee.columbia.edu</a></u>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  Macronix application notes claim that in order to put the chips in normal operation, the driver must
       write a certain magic number into the CSR16 register.  The numbers are documented in the app  notes,  but
       the exact meaning of the bits is not.

       The  98713A seems to have a problem with 10Mbps full duplex mode.  The transmitter works but the receiver
       tends to produce many unexplained errors leading to very poor overall performance.  The 98715A  does  not
       exhibit this problem.  All other modes on the 98713A seem to work correctly.

       The  original  82c168 PNIC chip has built in NWAY support which is used on certain early LinkSys LNE100TX
       and Matrox FastNIC cards, however it is horribly broken and difficult  to  use  reliably.   Consequently,
       autonegotiation  is not currently supported for this chipset: the driver defaults the NIC to 10baseT half
       duplex, and it is up to the operator to manually select a different mode if necessary.  (Later cards  use
       an external MII transceiver to implement NWAY autonegotiation and work correctly.)

       The <b>dc</b> driver programs 82c168 and 82c169 PNIC chips to use the store and forward setting for the transmit
       start threshold by default.  This is to work around problems with some NIC/PCI bus combinations where the
       PNIC  can  transmit  corrupt  frames  when  operating  at 100Mbps, probably due to PCI DMA burst transfer
       errors.

       The 82c168 and 82c169 PNIC chips also have a receiver bug that  sometimes  manifests  during  periods  of
       heavy receive and transmit activity, where the chip will improperly DMA received frames to the host.  The
       chips  appear  to  upload  several kilobytes of garbage data along with the received frame data, dirtying
       several RX buffers instead of just the expected one.  The <b>dc</b>  driver  detects  this  condition  and  will
       salvage the frame; however, it incurs a serious performance penalty in the process.

       The PNIC chips also sometimes generate a transmit underrun error when the driver attempts to download the
       receiver filter setup frame, which can result in the receive filter being incorrectly programmed.  The <b>dc</b>
       driver will watch for this condition and requeue the setup frame until it is transferred successfully.

       The  ADMtek AL981 chip (and possibly the AN985 as well) has been observed to sometimes wedge on transmit:
       this appears to happen when the driver queues a sequence of frames which cause it to wrap from the end of
       the transmit descriptor ring back to the beginning.  The <b>dc</b> driver attempts to avoid  this  condition  by
       not  queuing  any  frames  past the end of the transmit ring during a single invocation of the <b>dc_start</b>()
       routine.  This workaround has a negligible impact on transmit performance.
