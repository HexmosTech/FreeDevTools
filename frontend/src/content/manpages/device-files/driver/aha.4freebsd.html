</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       aha — Adaptec SCSI host adapter driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>device</b> <b>scbus</b>
             <b>device</b> <b>aha</b>

       Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             aha_load="YES"

       In <u>/boot/device.hints</u>:
       <b>hint.aha.0.at="isa"</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This driver provides access to the SCSI bus connected to the Adaptec AHA-154x SCSI host adapters.  x is 0
       for controllers without a floppy drive and 2 for controllers that have them.

       One  device  hint entry for every card to be attached by the system is required.  Specific values for the
       port address, IRQ, and DRQ may be specified.  If wildcard values are used,  the  driver  will  query  the
       device for its current settings and use those.  If the port address is a wildcard, the driver consults an
       internal  table  of  possible  port address locations and attaches to the first unattached card it finds.
       The possible port addresses for this card are 0x330, 0x334, 0x230, 0x234, 0x130, and 0x134.

</pre><h4><b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>aha</b> driver supports the following SCSI host adapters:

       <b>•</b>   Adaptec AHA-154xB
       <b>•</b>   Adaptec AHA-154xC
       <b>•</b>   Adaptec AHA-154xCF
       <b>•</b>   Adaptec AHA-154xCP
       <b>•</b>   DTC 3290 SCSI controller in 1542 emulation mode
       <b>•</b>   Tekram SCSI controllers in 154x emulation mode

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>aha</b> driver was ported by M. Warner Losh from the <b>bt</b> driver written by Justin T. Gibbs.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The AHA-154xA card does not support residuals on data transfers.  As a result, this  card  is  no  longer
       supported.

       There have been some reports that the AHA-154xB does not work well under heavy load.

       The AHA-154xCP is a plug and play controller.  However, its resources are set using the on-board BIOS and
       cannot  be moved.  Failures to attached for this card are often caused when the resources set in the BIOS
       conflict.
