       console_codes - Linux console escape and control sequences

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Linux console implements a large subset of the VT102 and ECMA-48 / ISO/IEC 6429 / ANSI X3.64 terminal
       controls,  plus certain private-mode sequences for changing the color palette, character-set mapping, and
       so on.  In the tabular descriptions below, the second column gives ECMA-48 or DEC mnemonics  (the  latter
       if  prefixed  with  DEC)  for  the  given function.  Sequences without a mnemonic are neither ECMA-48 nor
       VT102.

       After all the normal output processing has been done, and a stream of characters arrives at  the  console
       driver  for  actual  printing,  the  first  thing  that  happens  is a translation from the code used for
       processing to the code used for printing.

       If the console is in UTF-8 mode, then the incoming bytes are first assembled into 16-bit  Unicode  codes.
       Otherwise,  each  byte  is  transformed  according to the current mapping table (which translates it to a
       Unicode value).  See the <b>Character</b> <b>Sets</b> section below for discussion.

       In the normal case, the Unicode value is converted to a font index, and this is stored in  video  memory,
       so  that  the  corresponding  glyph  (as found in video ROM) appears on the screen.  Note that the use of
       Unicode (and the design of the PC hardware) allows us to use 512 different glyphs simultaneously.

       If the current Unicode value is a control character, or we are currently processing an  escape  sequence,
       the  value will treated specially.  Instead of being turned into a font index and rendered as a glyph, it
       may trigger cursor movement or other control functions.  See the <b>Linux</b> <b>Console</b> <b>Controls</b> section below for
       discussion.

       It is generally not good practice to  hard-wire  terminal  controls  into  programs.   Linux  supports  a
       <b><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></b>(5)  database  of  terminal capabilities.  Rather than emitting console escape sequences by hand,
       you will almost always want to use a  terminfo-aware  screen  library  or  utility  such  as  <b><a href="../man3/ncurses.3.html">ncurses</a></b>(3),
       <b><a href="../man1/tput.1.html">tput</a></b>(1), or <b><a href="../man1/reset.1.html">reset</a></b>(1).

   <b>Linux</b> <b>console</b> <b>controls</b>
       This  section  describes  all  the  control characters and escape sequences that invoke special functions
       (i.e., anything other than writing a glyph at the current cursor location) on the Linux console.

       <b>Control</b> <b>characters</b>

       A character is a control character if (before transformation according to the mapping table) it  has  one
       of  the  14  codes  00 (NUL), 07 (BEL), 08 (BS), 09 (HT), 0a (LF), 0b (VT), 0c (FF), 0d (CR), 0e (SO), 0f
       (SI), 18 (CAN), 1a (SUB), 1b (ESC), 7f (DEL).  One can set  a  "display  control  characters"  mode  (see
       below), and allow 07, 09, 0b, 18, 1a, 7f to be displayed as glyphs.  On the other hand, in UTF-8 mode all
       codes 00–1f are regarded as control characters, regardless of any "display control characters" mode.

       If we have a control character, it is acted upon immediately and then discarded (even in the middle of an
       escape  sequence)  and the escape sequence continues with the next character.  (However, ESC starts a new
       escape sequence, possibly aborting a previous unfinished one, and CAN and SUB abort any escape sequence.)
       The recognized control characters are BEL, BS, HT, LF, VT, FF, CR, SO, SI, CAN, SUB, ESC, DEL, CSI.  They
       do what one would expect:

       BEL (0x07, <b>^G</b>)
              beeps;

       BS (0x08, <b>^H</b>)
              backspaces one column (but not past the beginning of the line);

       HT (0x09, <b>^I</b>)
              goes to the next tab stop or to the end of the line if there is no earlier tab stop;

       LF (0x0A, <b>^J</b>)
       VT (0x0B, <b>^K</b>)
       FF (0x0C, <b>^L</b>)
              all give a linefeed, and if LF/NL (new-line mode) is set also a carriage return;

       CR (0x0D, <b>^M</b>)
              gives a carriage return;

       SO (0x0E, <b>^N</b>)
              activates the G1 character set;

       SI (0x0F, <b>^O</b>)
              activates the G0 character set;

       CAN (0x18, <b>^X</b>)
       SUB (0x1A, <b>^Z</b>)
              abort escape sequences;

       ESC (0x1B, <b>^[</b>)
              starts an escape sequence;

       DEL (0x7F)
              is ignored;

       CSI (0x9B)
              is equivalent to ESC [.

                          Here <u>n</u> is the color (0–15), and <u>rrggbb</u> indicates the red/green/blue values (0–255).

       <b>ECMA-48</b> <b>CSI</b> <b>sequences</b>

       CSI (or ESC [) is followed by a sequence of parameters, at most  NPAR  (16),  that  are  decimal  numbers
       separated  by semicolons.  An empty or absent parameter is taken to be 0.  The sequence of parameters may
       be preceded by a single question mark.

       However, after CSI [ (or ESC [ [) a single character is read and this entire sequence is  ignored.   (The
       idea is to ignore an echoed function key.)

       The action of a CSI sequence is determined by its final character.

       The  ECMA-48  SGR  sequence ESC [ <u>parameters</u> m sets display attributes.  Several attributes can be set in
       the same sequence, separated by semicolons.  An empty parameter (between semicolons or  string  initiator
       or terminator) is interpreted as a zero.

   <b>Character</b> <b>sets</b>
       The kernel knows about 4 translations of bytes into console-screen symbols.   The  four  tables  are:  a)
       Latin1 -&gt; PC, b) VT100 graphics -&gt; PC, c) PC -&gt; PC, d) user-defined.

       There are two character sets, called G0 and G1, and one of them is the current character set.  (Initially
       G0.)  Typing <b>^N</b> causes G1 to become current, <b>^O</b> causes G0 to become current.

       These  variables  G0 and G1 point at a translation table, and can be changed by the user.  Initially they
       point at tables a) and b), respectively.  The sequences ESC ( B and ESC ( 0 and ESC ( U and ESC ( K cause
       G0 to point at translation table a), b), c), and d), respectively.  The sequences ESC ) B and ESC ) 0 and
       ESC ) U and ESC ) K cause G1 to point at translation table a), b), c), and d), respectively.

       The sequence ESC c causes a terminal reset, which is what you want if the screen  is  all  garbled.   The
       oft-advised  "echo ^V^O" will make only G0 current, but there is no guarantee that G0 points at table a).
       In some distributions there is a program <b><a href="../man1/reset.1.html">reset</a></b>(1) that just does "echo ^[c".  If your terminfo entry  for
       the console is correct (and has an entry rs1=\Ec), then "tput reset" will also work.

       The  user-defined  mapping  table  can  be  set using <b><a href="../man8/mapscrn.8.html">mapscrn</a></b>(8).  The result of the mapping is that if a
       symbol c is printed, the symbol s = map[c] is sent to the video memory.  The bitmap that corresponds to s
       is found in the character ROM, and can be changed using <b><a href="../man8/setfont.8.html">setfont</a></b>(8).

   <b>Mouse</b> <b>tracking</b>
       The mouse tracking facility is intended to return <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1)-compatible mouse status reports.  Because  the
       console  driver  has  no  way  to know the device or type of the mouse, these reports are returned in the
       console input stream only when the virtual terminal driver receives a mouse update ioctl.   These  ioctls
       must be generated by a mouse-aware user-mode application such as the <b><a href="../man8/gpm.8.html">gpm</a></b>(8) daemon.

       The mouse tracking escape sequences generated by <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1) encode numeric parameters in a single character
       as <u>value</u>+040.  For example, '!' is 1.  The screen coordinate system is 1-based.

       The  X10  compatibility mode sends an escape sequence on button press encoding the location and the mouse
       button pressed.  It is enabled by sending ESC [ ? 9 h and disabled with ESC [ ? 9 l.   On  button  press,
       <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1)  sends  ESC [ M <u>bxy</u> (6 characters).  Here <u>b</u> is button-1, and <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are the x and y coordinates
       of the mouse when the button was pressed.  This is the same code the kernel also produces.

       Normal tracking mode (not implemented in Linux 2.0.24) sends an escape sequence on both button press  and
       release.   Modifier  information is also sent.  It is enabled by sending ESC [ ? 1000 h and disabled with
       ESC [ ? 1000 l.  On button press or release, <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1) sends ESC [ M <u>bxy</u>.  The low two bits  of  <u>b</u>  encode
       button  information:  0=MB1 pressed, 1=MB2 pressed, 2=MB3 pressed, 3=release.  The upper bits encode what
       modifiers were down when the button was pressed and are  added  together:  4=Shift,  8=Meta,  16=Control.
       Again <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are the x and y coordinates of the mouse event.  The upper left corner is (1,1).

   <b>Comparisons</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>terminals</b>
       Many  different  terminal types are described, like the Linux console, as being "VT100-compatible".  Here
       we discuss differences between the Linux console and the two most important others,  the  DEC  VT102  and
       <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1).

       <b>Control-character</b> <b>handling</b>

       The VT102 also recognized the following control characters:

       NUL (0x00)
              was ignored;

       ENQ (0x05)
              triggered an answerback message;

       DC1 (0x11, <b>^Q</b>, XON)
              resumed transmission;

       DC3 (0x13, <b>^S</b>, XOFF)
              caused VT100 to ignore (and stop transmitting) all codes except XOFF and XON.

       VT100-like DC1/DC3 processing may be enabled by the terminal driver.

       The  <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1)  program (in VT100 mode) recognizes the control characters BEL, BS, HT, LF, VT, FF, CR, SO,
       SI, ESC.

       <b>Escape</b> <b>sequences</b>

       VT100 console sequences not implemented on the Linux console:
       ESC N       SS2   Single  shift  2.   (Select   G2
                         character   set   for  the  next
                         character only.)
       ESC O       SS3   Single  shift  3.   (Select   G3
                         character   set   for  the  next
                         character only.)
       ESC P       DCS   Device control string (ended  by
                         ESC \)
       ESC X       SOS   Start of string.
       ESC ^       PM    Privacy message (ended by ESC \)
       ESC \       ST    String terminator
       ESC * ...         Designate G2 character set
       ESC + ...         Designate G3 character set

       The program <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1) (in VT100 mode) recognizes ESC c, ESC # 8, ESC &gt;, ESC =, ESC D, ESC E, ESC H, ESC M,
       ESC  N,  ESC  O,  ESC  P  ... ESC \, ESC Z (it answers ESC [ ? 1 ; 2 c, "I am a VT100 with advanced video
       option") and ESC ^ ... ESC \ with the same meanings as indicated above.  It accepts ESC (, ESC ), ESC  *,
       ESC  +  followed  by  0,  A,  B  for  the  DEC  special character and line drawing set, UK, and US-ASCII,
       respectively.

       The user can configure <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1) to respond to VT220-specific control  sequences,  and  it  will  identify
       itself as a VT52, VT100, and up depending on the way it is configured and initialized.

       It  accepts  ESC  ]  (OSC)  for  the  setting  of  certain  resources.  In addition to the ECMA-48 string
       terminator (ST), <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1) accepts a BEL to terminate an OSC string.  These are a few of the  OSC  control
       sequences recognized by <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1):
       ESC ] 0 ; <u>txt</u> ST        Set  icon  name  and  window title to
                               <u>txt</u>.
       ESC ] 1 ; <u>txt</u> ST        Set icon name to <u>txt</u>.
       ESC ] 2 ; <u>txt</u> ST        Set window title to <u>txt</u>.
       ESC ] 4 ; <u>num</u>; <u>txt</u> ST   Set ANSI color <u>num</u> to <u>txt</u>.
       ESC ] 10 ; <u>txt</u> ST       Set dynamic text color to <u>txt</u>.
       ESC ] 4 6 ; <u>name</u> ST     Change log  file  to  <u>name</u>  (normally
                               disabled by a compile-time option).
       ESC ] 5 0 ; <u>fn</u> ST       Set font to <u>fn</u>.

       It  recognizes  the  following  with  slightly  modified  meaning  (saving more state, behaving closer to
       VT100/VT220):
       ESC 7  DECSC   Save cursor
       ESC 8  DECRC   Restore cursor

       It also recognizes
       ESC F          Cursor to lower left corner of  screen  (if  enabled  by  <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1)'s  <b>hpLowerleftBugCompat</b>
                      resource).
       ESC l          Memory lock (per HP terminals).
                      Locks memory above the cursor.
       ESC m          Memory unlock (per HP terminals).
       ESC n   LS2    Invoke the G2 character set.
       ESC o   LS3    Invoke the G3 character set.
       ESC |   LS3R   Invoke the G3 character set as GR.
                      Has no visible effect in xterm.
       ESC }   LS2R   Invoke the G2 character set as GR.
                      Has no visible effect in xterm.
       ESC ~   LS1R   Invoke the G1 character set as GR.

       It also recognizes ESC % and provides a more complete UTF-8 implementation than Linux console.

       <b>CSI</b> <b>Sequences</b>

       Old versions of <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1), for example, from X11R5, interpret the blink SGR as a bold SGR.  Later versions
       which  implemented  ANSI colors, for example, XFree86 3.1.2A in 1995, improved this by allowing the blink
       attribute to be displayed as a color.  Modern versions of xterm implement blink SGR as blinking text  and
       still  allow  colored text as an alternate rendering of SGRs.  Stock X11R6 versions did not recognize the
       color-setting SGRs until the  X11R6.8  release,  which  incorporated  XFree86  xterm.   All  ECMA-48  CSI
       sequences  recognized  by Linux are also recognized by <u>xterm</u>, however <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1) implements several ECMA-48
       and DEC control sequences not recognized by Linux.

       The <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1) program recognizes all of the DEC Private Mode sequences listed above, but none of the Linux
       private-mode sequences.  For discussion of <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1)'s own private-mode  sequences,  refer  to  the  <u>Xterm</u>
       <u>Control</u>  <u>Sequences</u>  document  by  Edward  Moy,  Stephen Gildea, and Thomas E. Dickey available with the X
       distribution.  That document, though terse, is much longer than this manual page.   For  a  chronological
       overview,

       The <u>vttest</u> program

              <a href="http://invisible-island.net/vttest/">http://invisible-island.net/vttest/</a>

       demonstrates  many  of  these  control  sequences.  The <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1) source distribution also contains sample
       scripts which exercise other features.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       ESC 8 (DECRC) is not able to restore the character set changed with ESC %.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       In Linux 2.0.23, CSI is broken, and NUL is not ignored inside escape sequences.

       Some older kernel versions (after Linux 2.0) interpret 8-bit control sequences.  These "C1 controls"  use
       codes  between  128  and  159  to  replace ESC [, ESC ] and similar two-byte control sequence initiators.
       There are fragments of that in modern kernels (either overlooked or broken by changes to support  UTF-8),
       but the implementation is incomplete and should be regarded as unreliable.

       Linux "private mode" sequences do not follow the rules in ECMA-48 for private mode control sequences.  In
       particular,  those  ending  with  ]  do  not use a standard terminating character.  The OSC (set palette)
       sequence is a greater problem, since <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1) may interpret this as a control sequence which  requires  a
       string  terminator  (ST).   Unlike the <b><a href="../man1/setterm.1.html">setterm</a></b>(1) sequences which will be ignored (since they are invalid
       control sequences), the palette sequence will make <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1) appear to hang (though pressing  the  return-
       key  will  fix  that).   To  accommodate  applications  which  have  been  hardcoded to use Linux control
       sequences, set the <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1) resource <b>brokenLinuxOSC</b> to true.

       An older version of this document  implied  that  Linux  recognizes  the  ECMA-48  control  sequence  for
       invisible text.  It is ignored.
