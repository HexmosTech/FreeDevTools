</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rp — driver for Comtrol RocketPort Intelligent Serial Port Cards

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>device</b> <b>rp</b>

       For ISA cards, you must specify the port address in <u>/boot/device.hints</u>:
       <b>hint.rp.0.at="isa"</b>
       <b>hint.rp.0.port="0x100"</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  driver  provides  a kernel device driver for the RocketPort and RocketPort RA serial boards.  These
       boards provide 8, 16, or 32 high-speed serial ports while requiring only 68 bytes of I/O space for all 8,
       16, or 32 ports, and do not require an interrupt channel.  This driver supports up to four RocketPort  or
       RocketPort RA boards in one machine simultaneously.  If you are using four 32 port RocketPort boards, you
       can put as many as 128 intelligent serial ports on your system.

       The  <b>rp</b>  driver  supports  the  following speeds: 50, 75, 110, 134, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400,
       4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 7200, 14400, 57600, 76800, 115200,  and  230400.   (You  must  use  <u><a href="../man4/termios.4.html">termios</a></u>(4),
       rather than the old style ioctl interface to use non-traditional speeds.)

       An open on the <b>rp</b> driver will block until carrier is present, unless O_NONBLOCK or CLOCAL is set.

</pre><h4><b>HARDWARE</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The first RocketPort or RocketPort RA card requires a 68-byte contiguous block of I/O addresses, starting
       at  one  of  the  following: 0x100h, 0x140h, 0x180h, 0x200h, 0x240h, 0x280h, 0x300h, 0x340h, 0x380h.  The
       second, third, and fourth RocketPort cards require only a 64-byte  contiguous  block  of  I/O  addresses,
       starting  at  one of the above address ranges.  The I/O address range used by any of the RocketPort cards
       must not conflict with any other cards in the system, including other  RocketPort  cards.   The  starting
       range of the I/O ports used by each card must match with the I/O address specified in <u>/boot/device.hints</u>.

       Since  the  first RocketPort uses 68 I/O addresses, if the first card is set to use an I/O block starting
       at 0x100, it will occupy the I/O ports between 0x100 and 0x143.  This means that the  second,  third,  or
       fourth  RocketPort  board may not use the block of addresses starting at 0x140, since the first three I/O
       addresses of that range are used by the first board.  This is an important point to keep in mind.

       If you have two ISA cards, one installed at 0x100 and the second installed at 0x180, then you should  add
       the following to <u>/boot/device.hints</u>:

             <b>hint.rp.0.at="isa"</b>
             <b>hint.rp.0.port="0x100"</b>
             <b>hint.rp.1.at="isa"</b>
             <b>hint.rp.1.port="0x180"</b>

       The  configuration  of  the  RocketPort  cards  is done via the set of 8 DIP switches, labeled SW1 on the
       RocketPort card:

             +-------------------------------+
             | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
             +-------+-------+---------------+
             | Unused| Card  | I/O Port Block|
             +-------------------------------+

       DIP switches 7 and 8 are unused, and must be left on.

       DIP switches 6 and 5 identify the card number of each RocketPort card.  The first card installed  in  the
       system  must  have  its DIP switches set as card number one; the second card installed in the system must
       have its DIP switches set as card number two; and so on.  As shipped from the factory, DIP switches 6 and
       5 are both on by default, indicating that this is the first card installed on the system:

             DIP Switches

             ===================
             On   On   First Card
             On   Off  Second Card
             Off  On   Third Card
             Off  Off  Fourth Card

       DIP switches 4, 3, 2, and 1 indicate the I/O address range used by the first RocketPort card.   If  there
       are  more  than one RocketPort cards installed in a system, the second, third and fourth RocketPort cards
       must also be set to the I/O address range used by the first RocketPort card; all cards  must  have  these
       DIP  switches set identically for proper operation.  As shipped from the factory, DIP switch 4 is on, and
       switches 3, 2, and 1 are off by default, indicating an I/O address range used by  the  first  card  which
       starts at 0x180 and extends to 0x1C3.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If incoming software flow control is enabled on a 486 or Pentium machine, and the flow  control  is  very
       heavily exercised, on rare occasions a character will get dropped.  This problem does not occur on a 386,
       and it is not currently known whether the bug is in the <b>rp</b> driver or in the BSD/OS tty layer.
