</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       altera_sdcard — driver for the Altera University Program Secure Data Card IP Core

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>device</b> <b>altera_sdcard</b>

       In <u>/boot/device.hints</u>:
       <b>hint.altera_sdcardc.0.at="nexus0"</b>
       <b>hint.altera_sdcardc.0.maddr=0x7f008000</b>
       <b>hint.altera_sdcardc.0.msize=0x400</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>altera_sdcard</b>  device driver provides support for the Altera University Program Secure Data Card (SD
       Card) IP Core device.  A controller device, <b>altera_sdcardcX</b>, will  be  attached  during  boot.   Inserted
       disks are presented as <u><a href="../man9/disk.9.html">disk</a></u>(9) devices, <b>altera_sdcardX</b>, corresponding to the controller number.

</pre><h4><b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       The  current  version of the <b>altera_sdcard</b> driver supports the SD Card IP core as described in the August
       2011 version of Altera's documentation.  The core supports only cards up to 2G (CSD 0); larger cards,  or
       cards  using  newer  CSD  versions, will not be detected.  The IP core has two key limitations: a lack of
       interrupt support, requiring timer-driven polling to detect I/O completion, and support for  only  single
       512-byte  block read and write operations at a time.  The combined effect of those two limits is that the
       system clock rate, HZ, must be set to at least 200 in order to accomplish the maximum 100KB/s  data  rate
       supported by the IP core.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>altera_sdcard</b> device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 10.0.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>altera_sdcard</b> device driver and this  manual  page  were  developed  by  SRI  International  and  the
       University  of  Cambridge  Computer Laboratory under DARPA/AFRL contract (FA8750-10-C-0237) (“CTSRD”), as
       part of the DARPA CRASH research programme.  This device driver was written by Robert N. M. Watson.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>altera_sdcard</b> contains a number of work-arounds for IP core bugs.  Perhaps most critically, <b>altera_sdcard</b>
       ignores the CRC error bit returned in the RR1 register, which appears to be unexpectedly set  by  the  IP
       core.

       <b>altera_sdcard</b>  uses  fixed  polling  intervals  are  used  for  card insertion/removal and I/O completion
       detection; an adaptive strategy might improve performance by reducing the latency to detecting  completed
       I/O.   However,  in  our experiments, using polling rates greater than 200 times a second did not improve
       performance.

       <b>altera_sdcard</b> supports only a <b>nexus</b> bus attachment, which is appropriate for system-on-chip  busses  such
       as  Altera's  Avalon  bus.   If  the  IP  core is configured off of another bus type, then additional bus
       attachments will be required.
