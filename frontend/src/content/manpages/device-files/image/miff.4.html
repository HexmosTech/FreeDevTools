       MIFF - Magick Image File Format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;image.h&gt;</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Magick Image File Format (MIFF) is a platform-independent format for storing bitmap images.  MIFF is
       a part of the ImageMagick toolkit of image manipulation utilities for the X Window  System.   ImageMagick
       is capable of converting many different image file formats to and from MIFF (e.g. JPEG, XPM, TIFF, etc.).

       A MIFF image file consist of two sections.  The first section is a header composed of keys describing the
       image  in  text form.  The next section is the binary image data.  The header is separated from the image
       data by a <b>:</b> character immediately followed by a <b>newline</b>.

       The MIFF header is composed entirely of LATIN-1 characters.  The fields in the header are key  and  value
       combination  in  the  <u>key=value</u>  format,  with  each  key and value separated by an equal sign (=).  Each
       <u>key=value</u> combination is delimited by at least one control or whitespace character.  Comments may  appear
       in  the  header section and are always delimited by braces.  The MIFF header always ends with a colon (:)
       character, followed by a <b>ctrl-Z</b> character.  It is also common to proceed the colon with a <b>formfeed</b> and  a
       <b>newline</b>  character.  The <b>formfeed</b> prevents the listing of binary data when using <b><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a>(1)</b> under Unix where
       the <b>ctrl-Z</b> has the same effect with the <b>type</b> command on the Win32 command line.

       The following is a list of <u>key=value</u> combinations that may be found in a MIFF file:

       <b>background-color=</b><u>color</u>
              <b>border-color=</b><u>color</u> <b>matte-color=</b><u>color</u> these optional keys reflects the  image  background,  border,
              and matte colors respectively. A color can be a name (e.g. white) or a hex value (e.g. #ccc).

       <b>class=</b><u>DirectClass</u>
              <b>class=PseudoClass</b>  the  type  of  binary  image  data stored in the MIFF file.  If this key is not
              present, <b>DirectClass</b> image data is assumed.

       <b>colors=</b><u>value</u>
              the number of colors in a <b>DirectClass</b> image. For a <b>PseudoClass</b> image, this key specifies the  size
              of the colormap.  If this key is not present in the header, and the image is <b>PseudoClass</b>, a linear
              256  color grayscale colormap is used with the image data.  The maximum number of colormap entries
              is 65535.  <b>colorspace=CMYK</b> the colorspace of the pixel data.  The default is RGB.

       <b>columns=</b><u>value</u>
              the width of the image in pixels.  This is a required key and has no default.

       <b>compression=BZip</b>
              <b>compression=Fax</b> <b>compression=JPEG</b>  <b>compression=LZW</b>  <b>compression=RLE</b>  <b>compression=Zip</b>  the  type  of
              algorithm  used to compress the image data.  If this key is not present, the image data is assumed
              to be uncompressed.

       <b>delay</b> <u>&lt;1/100ths</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>second&gt;</u>
              the interframe delay in an image sequence.  The maximum delay is 65535.

       <b>depth=8</b>
              <b>depth=16</b> the depth of a single color value representing values from 0 to 255 (depth  8)  or  65535
              (depth 16).  If this key is absent, a depth of 8 is assumed.

       <b>dispose</b> <u>value</u>
              GIF disposal method.

              Here are the valid methods:

                   0  No disposal specified.
                   1  Do not dispose between frames.
                   2  Overwrite frame with background color from header.
                   3  Overwrite with previous frame.

       <b>gamma=</b><u>value</u>
              the  gamma  of  the image.  If it is not specified, a gamma of 1.0 (linear brightness response) is
              assumed,

       <b>id=ImageMagick</b>
              identifies the file as a MIFF-format image file.   This  key  is  required  and  has  no  default.
              Although  this  key  can  appear  anywhere  in the header, it should start as the first key of the
              header in column 1.  This will allow programs like <b><a href="../man1/file.1.html">file</a></b>(1) to easily identify the file as MIFF.

       <b>iterations</b> <u>value</u>
              the number of times an image sequence loops before stopping.

       <b>label=</b><u>{value}</u>
              defines a short title or caption for the image.  If any whitespace appears in the label,  it  must
              be enclosed within braces.

       <b>matte=True</b>
              <b>matte=False</b>  specifies whether a <b>DirectClass</b> image has matte data.  Matte data is generally useful
              for image compositing.  This key has no meaning for pseudo-color images.

       <b>montage=</b><u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;{+-}&lt;x</u> <u>offset&gt;{+-}&lt;y</u> <u>offset&gt;</u>
              size and location of the individual tiles of a composite image.  See <b><a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1)</b> for  details  about  the
              geometry specification.

              Use  this key when the image is a composite of a number of different tiles.  A tile consists of an
              image and optionally a border and a label.  <u>&lt;width&gt;</u> is the size in pixels of each individual  tile
              in  the  horizontal  direction and <u>&lt;height&gt;</u> is the size in the vertical direction.  Each tile must
              have an equal number of pixels in width and equal in height.  However, the width can  differ  from
              the  height.  <u>&lt;x</u> <u>offset&gt;</u> is the offset in number of pixels from the vertical edge of the composite
              image where the first tile of a row begins and <u>&lt;y</u> <u>offset&gt;</u> is the offset from the  horizontal  edge
              where the first tile of a column begins.

              If  this  key is specified, a directory of tile names must follow the image header.  The format of
              the directory is explained below.

       <b>page=</b><u>value</u>
              preferred size and location of an image canvas.

       <b>profile-icc=</b><u>value</u>
              the number of bytes in the International Color Consortium color profile.  The profile  is  defined
              by the ICC profile specification located at <a href="ftp://sgigate.sgi.com/pub/icc/icc34.ps">ftp://sgigate.sgi.com/pub/icc/icc34.ps</a>.

       <b>colorspace=RGB</b>

       <b>red-primary=</b><u>x,y</u>
              <b>green-primary=</b><u>x,y</u>  <b>blue-primary=</b><u>x,y</u>  <b>white-point=</b><u>x,y</u>  this  optional key reflects the chromaticity
              primaries and white point.

       <b>rendering-intent=saturation</b>
              <b>rendering-intent=perceptual</b> <b>rendering-intent=absolute</b> <b>rendering-intent=relative</b>  Rendering  intent
              is   the   CSS-1   property   that   has  been  defined  by  the  International  Color  Consortium
              (<a href="http://www.color.org">http://www.color.org</a>).

       <b>resolution=</b><u>&lt;x-resolution&gt;x&lt;y-resolution&gt;</u>
              vertical and horizontal resolution of the image.  See <b>units</b>  for  the  specific  resolution  units
              (e.g. pixels per inch).

       <b>rows=</b><u>value</u>
              the height of the image in pixels.  This is a required key and has no default.

       <b>scene=</b><u>value</u>
              the sequence number for this MIFF image file.  This optional key is used when a MIFF image file is
              one in a sequence of files used in an animation.

       <b>signature=</b><u>value</u>
              this  optional  key  contains  a string that uniquely identifies the image pixel contents.  NIST's
              SHA-256 message digest algorithm is recommended.

       <b>units=pixels-per-inch</b>
              <b>units=pixels-per-centimeter</b> image resolution units.

              Other key value pairs are permitted.  If a value contains whitespace  it  must  be  enclosed  with
              braces as illustrated here:

                  id=ImageMagick
                  class=PseudoClass  colors=256
                  compression=RunlengthEncoded  packets=27601
                  columns=1280  rows=1024
                  signature=d79e1c308aa5bbcdeea8ed63df412da9
                  copyright={Copyright (c) 2001 ImageMagick Studio}
                  &lt;FF&gt;
                  :

       Note that <u>key=value</u> combinations may be separated by newlines or spaces and may occur in any order within
       the header.  Comments (within braces) may appear anywhere before the colon.

       If  you  specify  the <b>montage</b> key in the header, follow the header with a directory of image tiles.  This
       directory consists of a name for each tile of the composite image separated by a <b>newline</b> character.   The
       list is terminated with a NULL character.

       If  you  specify  the  <b>color-profile</b>  key  in  the header, follow the header (or montage directory if the
       <b>montage</b> key is in the header) with the binary color profile.

       Next comes the binary image data itself.  How the image data is formatted depends upon the class  of  the
       image as specified (or not specified) by the value of the <b>class</b> key in the header.

       DirectClass images (class=DirectClass) are continuous-tone, images stored as RGB (red, green, blue), RGBA
       (red,  green,  blue,  alpha),  or  CMYK (cyan, yellow, magenta, black) intensity values as defined by the
       colorspace key. Each intensity value is one byte in length for  images  of  depth  8  (0..255),  whereas,
       images of depth 16 (0..65535) require two bytes in most significant byte first order.

       PseudoClass  images (class=PseudoClass) are colormapped RGB images. The colormap is stored as a series of
       red, green, and blue pixel values, each value being a byte in size.  If  the  image  depth  is  16,  each
       colormap  entry  consumes  two  bytes  with the most significant byte being first. The number of colormap
       entries is defined by the colors key.  The colormap data occurs  immediately  following  the  header  (or
       image  directory if the montage key is in the header). PseudoClass image data is an array of index values
       into the color map. If there are 256 or fewer colors in the image, each byte of image  data  contains  an
       index  value.  If  the  image  contains more than 256 colors or the image depth is 16, the index value is
       stored as two contiguous bytes with the most significant  byte  being  first.  If  matte  is  true,  each
       colormap index is followed by a 1 or 2-byte alpha value.

       The image data in a MIFF file may be uncompressed, runlength encoded, Zip compressed, or BZip compressed.
       The  compression key in the header defines how the image data is compressed. Uncompressed pixels are just
       stored one scanline at a time in row order.  Runlength  encoded  compression  counts  runs  of  identical
       adjacent pixels and stores the pixels followed by a length byte (the number of identical pixels minus 1).
       Zip  and BZip compression compresses each row of an image and precedes the compressed row with the length
       of compressed pixel bytes as a word in most significant byte first order.

       MIFF files may contain more than one image.  Simply concatenate each  individual  image  (composed  of  a
       header and image data) into one file.
