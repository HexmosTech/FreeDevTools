</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sppp — point to point protocol network layer for synchronous lines

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>device</b> <b>sppp</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sppp</b>  network layer implements the state machine and the Link Control Protocol (LCP) of the <u>point</u> <u>to</u>
       <u>point</u> <u>protocol</u> <u>(PPP)</u> as described in RFC 1661.  Note that this layer does not provide network  interfaces
       of  its own, it is rather intended to be layered on top of drivers providing a synchronous point-to-point
       connection that wish to run a PPP stack over  it.   The  corresponding  network  interfaces  have  to  be
       provided by these hardware drivers.

       The  <b>sppp</b>  layer  provides three basic modes of operation.  The default mode, with no special flags to be
       set, is to create the PPP connection (administrative <u>Open</u>  event  to  the  LCP  layer)  as  soon  as  the
       interface  is  taken up with the <u><a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a></u>(8) command.  Taking the interface down again will terminate the
       LCP layer and thus all other layers on top.  The link will also terminate itself as soon  as  no  Network
       Control Protocol (NCP) is open anymore, indicating that the lower layers are no longer needed.

       Setting the link-level flag <u>link0</u> with <u><a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a></u>(8) will cause the respective network interface to go into
       <u>passive</u> mode.  This means, the administrative <u>Open</u> event to the LCP layer will be delayed until after the
       lower  layers  signals  an  <u>Up</u>  event (rise of “carrier”).  This can be used by lower layers to support a
       dialin connection where the physical layer is not available immediately at startup, but only  after  some
       external  event  arrives.   Receipt  of  a  <u>Down</u>  event  from the lower layer will not take the interface
       completely down in this case.

       Finally, setting the flag <u>link1</u> will cause the interface to operate in <u>dial-on-demand</u> mode.  This is also
       only useful if the lower layer supports the  notion  of  a  carrier.   Upon  configuring  the  respective
       interface,  it will delay the administrative <u>Open</u> event to the LCP layer until either an outbound network
       packet arrives, or until the lower layer signals an <u>Up</u> event, indicating an inbound connection.  As  with
       passive  mode,  receipt of a <u>Down</u> event (loss of carrier) will not automatically take the interface down,
       thus it remains available for further connections.

       The <b>sppp</b> layer supports the <u>debug</u> interface flag that can be set with <u><a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a></u>(8).  If this flag is  set,
       the  various control protocol packets being exchanged as well as the option negotiation between both ends
       of the link will be logged at level LOG_DEBUG.  This can be helpful  to  examine  configuration  problems
       during  the  first  attempts  to set up a new configuration.  Without this flag being set, only the major
       phase transitions will be logged at level LOG_INFO.

       It is possible to leave the local interface IP address open for negotiation by  setting  it  to  0.0.0.0.
       This  requires  that  the  remote  peer  can correctly supply a value for it based on the identity of the
       caller, or on the remote address supplied by this side.  Due to  the  way  the  IPCP  option  negotiation
       works,  this  address is being supplied late during the negotiation, which might cause the remote peer to
       make wrong assumptions.

       In a similar spirit the remote address can be set to the magical value <b>0.0.0.</b><u>*</u> which means that we do not
       care what address the remote side will use, as long as it is not 0.0.0.0.  This is useful if your ISP has
       several dial-in servers.  You can of course <b>route</b> <b>add</b> <u>something_or_other</u> <u>0.0.0.*</u> and it will  do  exactly
       what you would want it to.

       The  PAP  and  CHAP  authentication  protocols  as  described  in  RFC 1334, and RFC 1994 resp., are also
       implemented.  Their parameters are being controlled by the <u><a href="../man8/spppcontrol.8.html">spppcontrol</a></u>(8) utility.

       VJ header compression is implemented, and enabled by default.  It can be disabled using <u><a href="../man8/spppcontrol.8.html">spppcontrol</a></u>(8).

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>&lt;ifname&gt;&lt;ifnum&gt;:</b> <b>&lt;proto&gt;</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>&lt;event&gt;</b> <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>&lt;statename&gt;</b>  An event happened that should  not  happen
       for the current state the respective control protocol is in.  See RFC 1661 for a description of the state
       automaton.

       <b>&lt;ifname&gt;&lt;ifnum&gt;:</b>  <b>loopback</b>    The  state automaton detected a line loopback (that is, it was talking with
       itself).  The interface will be temporarily disabled.

       <b>&lt;ifname&gt;&lt;ifnum&gt;:</b> <b>up</b>  The LCP layer is running again, after a line loopback had previously been detected.

       <b>&lt;ifname&gt;&lt;ifnum&gt;:</b> <b>down</b>  The keepalive facility detected the line being unresponsive.   Keepalive  must  be
       explicitly requested by the lower layers in order to take place.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The  original  implementation  of  <b>sppp</b>  was  written  in  1994 at Cronyx Ltd., Moscow by Serge Vakulenko
       &lt;<u><a href="mailto:vak@cronyx.ru">vak@cronyx.ru</a></u>&gt;.  Jörg Wunsch &lt;<u><a href="mailto:joerg_wunsch@uriah.heep.sax.de">joerg_wunsch@uriah.heep.sax.de</a></u>&gt; rewrote a large part in 1997 in  order  to
       fully  implement  the  state machine as described in RFC 1661, so it could also be used for dialup lines.
       He also wrote this man page.  Serge later on wrote a basic implementation for PAP and CHAP, which  served
       as the base for the current implementation, done again by Jörg Wunsch.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Many.

       Currently,  only  the <u>IPCP</u> control protocol and <u><a href="../man4/ip.4.html">ip</a></u>(4) network protocol is supported.  More NCPs should be
       implemented, as well as other control protocols for authentication and link quality reporting.

       Negotiation loop avoidance is not fully implemented.  If the negotiation  does  not  converge,  this  can
       cause an endless loop.

       The  various  parameters that should be adjustable per RFC 1661 are currently hard-coded into the kernel,
       and should be made accessible through <u><a href="../man8/spppcontrol.8.html">spppcontrol</a></u>(8).

       <u>Passive</u> mode has not been tested extensively.

       Link-level compression protocols should be supported.
