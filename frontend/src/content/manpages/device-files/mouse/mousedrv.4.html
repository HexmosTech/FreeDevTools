</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mouse</b>  is  an Xorg input driver for mice.  The driver supports most available mouse types and interfaces,
       though the level of support for types of mice depends on the OS.

       The <b>mouse</b> driver functions as a pointer input device. Multiple mice are supported by  multiple  instances
       of this driver.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       USB mouse
              USB  (Universal  Serial  Bus)  ports  are present on most modern computers. Several devices can be
              plugged into this bus, including mice and keyboards.  Support for USB mice is platform specific.

       PS/2 mouse
              The PS/2 mouse is an intelligent device and may have more than three buttons  and  a  wheel  or  a
              roller.   The  PS/2  mouse is usually compatible with the original PS/2 mouse from IBM immediately
              after power up.  The PS/2 mouse with additional features  requires  a  specialized  initialization
              procedure  to  enable these features.  Without proper initialization, it behaves as though it were
              an ordinary two or three button mouse.

       Serial mouse
              There have been numerous serial mouse models from a number of  manufacturers.   Despite  the  wide
              range  of variations, there have been relatively few protocols (data format) with which the serial
              mouse talks to the host computer.

              The modern serial mouse conforms to the PnP COM device specification so that the host computer can
              automatically detect the mouse  and  load  an  appropriate  driver.   This  driver  supports  this
              specification and can detect popular PnP serial mouse models on most platforms.

       Bus mouse
              The  bus  mouse  connects  to  a  dedicated interface card in an expansion slot.  Some older video
              cards, notably those from ATI, and integrated I/O cards may also have a bus mouse connector.

       The interface type of the mouse can be determined by looking at the connector of  the  mouse.   USB  mice
       have  a  thin  rectangular  connector.   PS/2  mice are equipped with a small, round DIN 6-pin connector.
       Serial mouse have a D-Sub female 9- or 25-pin connector.   Bus  mice  have  either  a  D-Sub  male  9-pin
       connector  or  a round DIN 9-pin connector.  Some mice come with adapters with which the connector can be
       converted to another.  If you are to use such an adapter, remember that the connector at the very end  of
       the mouse/adapter pair is what matters.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       Depending  on the X server version in use, input device options may be set in either a xorg.conf file, an
       xorg.conf.d snippet or in the configuration files read by the Hardware Abstraction  Layer  (HAL)  daemon,
       <a href="../man1/hald.1.html">hald</a>(1).

       Please  refer to <a href="../man5/xorg.conf.5.html">xorg.conf</a>(5) for general configuration details and for options that can be used with all
       input drivers.  This section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver can auto-detect the mouse type on some platforms.  On some platforms this is limited  to  plug
       and  play  serial  mice,  and  on some the auto-detection works for any mouse that the OS's kernel driver
       supports.  On others, it is always necessary to specify the mouse  protocol  in  the  config  file.   The
       <u>README</u> document provided with this driver contains some detailed information about this.

       The following driver <b>Options</b> are supported:

       <b>Option</b> <b>"Protocol"</b> <b>"</b><u>string</u><b>"</b>
              Specify the mouse protocol.  Valid protocol types include:

                   Auto,   Microsoft,   MouseSystems,   MMSeries,   Logitech,  MouseMan,  MMHitTab,  GlidePoint,
                   IntelliMouse,   ThinkingMouse,   ValuMouseScroll,   AceCad,   PS/2,   ImPS/2,   ExplorerPS/2,
                   ThinkingMousePS/2,  MouseManPlusPS/2,  GlidePointPS/2, NetMousePS/2, NetScrollPS/2, BusMouse,
                   SysMouse, WSMouse, USB, VUID, Xqueue.

              Not all protocols are supported on all platforms.  The "Auto"  protocol  specifies  that  protocol
              auto-detection should be attempted.  The default protocol setting is platform-specific.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"Device"</b> <b>"</b><u>string</u><b>"</b>
              Specifies  the  device through which the mouse can be accessed.  A common setting is "/dev/mouse",
              which is often a symbolic link to the real device.  This option is  mandatory,  and  there  is  no
              default  setting.  The  driver may however attempt to probe some default devices if this option is
              missing.  Property: "Device Node" (read-only).

       <b>Option</b> <b>"Buttons"</b> <b>"</b><u>integer</u><b>"</b>
              Specifies the number of mouse buttons.  In cases where the  number  of  buttons  cannot  be  auto-
              detected, the default value is 3.  The maximum number is 24.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"Emulate3Buttons"</b> <b>"</b><u>boolean</u><b>"</b>
              Enable/disable  the  emulation  of  the  third  (middle) mouse button for mice which only have two
              physical buttons.  The third button is emulated by pressing both buttons simultaneously.  Default:
              on, until a press of a physical button 3 is detected.  Property: "Mouse Middle Button Emulation"

       <b>Option</b> <b>"Emulate3Timeout"</b> <b>"</b><u>integer</u><b>"</b>
              Sets the timeout (in milliseconds) that the driver waits before  deciding  if  two  buttons  where
              pressed  "simultaneously"  when  3  button  emulation is enabled.  Default: 50.   Property: "Mouse
              Middle Button Timeout"

       <b>Option</b> <b>"ChordMiddle"</b> <b>"</b><u>boolean</u><b>"</b>
              Enable/disable handling of mice that send left+right  events  when  the  middle  button  is  used.
              Default: off.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"EmulateWheel"</b> <b>"</b><u>boolean</u><b>"</b>
              Enable/disable  "wheel"  emulation.   Wheel  emulation means emulating button press/release events
              when the mouse is moved while a specific real button is pressed.  Wheel button  events  (typically
              buttons 4 and 5) are usually used for scrolling.  Wheel emulation is useful for getting wheel-like
              behaviour  with  trackballs.   It can also be useful for mice with 4 or more buttons but no wheel.
              See the description of the <b>EmulateWheelButton</b>, <b>EmulateWheelInertia</b>, <b>XAxisMapping</b>, and <b>YAxisMapping</b>
              options below.  Default: off.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"EmulateWheelButton"</b> <b>"</b><u>integer</u><b>"</b>
              Specifies which button must be held down to enable wheel emulation mode.   While  this  button  is
              down,  X  and/or Y pointer movement will generate button press/release events as specified for the
              <b>XAxisMapping</b> and <b>YAxisMapping</b> settings.  If set to 0, no button is required and any motion of  the
              device is converted into wheel events.  Default: 4.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"EmulateWheelInertia"</b> <b>"</b><u>integer</u><b>"</b>
              Specifies  how  far  (in  pixels) the pointer must move to generate button press/release events in
              wheel emulation mode.  Default: 10.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"EmulateWheelTimeout"</b> <b>"</b><u>integer</u><b>"</b>
              Specifies the time in milliseconds the <b>EmulateWheelButton</b> must be pressed before  wheel  emulation
              is  started.  If  the  <b>EmulateWheelButton</b>  is  released  before  this timeout, the original button
              press/release event is sent.  Default: 200.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"XAxisMapping"</b> <b>"</b><u>N1</u> <u>N2</u><b>"</b>
              Specifies which buttons are mapped to motion in the X direction in wheel emulation  mode.   Button
              number <u>N1</u> is mapped to the negative X axis motion and button number <u>N2</u> is mapped to the positive X
              axis motion.  Default: no mapping.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"YAxisMapping"</b> <b>"</b><u>N1</u> <u>N2</u><b>"</b>
              Specifies  which  buttons are mapped to motion in the Y direction in wheel emulation mode.  Button
              number <u>N1</u> is mapped to the negative Y axis motion and button number <u>N2</u> is mapped to the positive Y
              axis motion.  Default: no mapping.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"ZAxisMapping"</b> <b>"X"</b>

       <b>Option</b> <b>"ZAxisMapping"</b> <b>"Y"</b>

       <b>Option</b> <b>"ZAxisMapping"</b> <b>"</b><u>N1</u> <u>N2</u><b>"</b>

       <b>Option</b> <b>"ZAxisMapping"</b> <b>"</b><u>N1</u> <u>N2</u> <u>N3</u> <u>N4</u><b>"</b>
              Set the mapping for the Z axis (wheel) motion to buttons or another axis (<b>X</b> or <b>Y</b>).  Button  number
              <u>N1</u>  is  mapped to the negative Z axis motion and button number <u>N2</u> is mapped to the positive Z axis
              motion.  For mice with two wheels, four button numbers can be specified,  with  the  negative  and
              positive  motion  of  the second wheel mapped respectively to buttons number <u>N3</u> and <u>N4</u>.  Note that
              the protocols for mice with one and two wheels can be different and the driver may not be able  to
              autodetect it.  Default: "4 5".

       <b>Option</b> <b>"ButtonMapping"</b> <b>"</b><u>N1</u> <u>N2</u> <u>[...]</u><b>"</b>
              Specifies  how  physical mouse buttons are mapped to logical buttons.  Physical button 1 is mapped
              to logical button <u>N1</u>, physical button 2 to <u>N2</u>, and so forth.  This enables  the  use  of  physical
              buttons that are obscured by <u>ZAxisMapping</u>.  Default: "1 2 3 8 9 10 ...".

       <b>Option</b> <b>"FlipXY"</b> <b>"</b><u>boolean</u><b>"</b>
              Enable/disable swapping the X and Y axes.  This transformation is applied after the <b>InvX</b>, <b>InvY</b> and
              <b>AngleOffset</b> transformations.  Default: off.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"InvX"</b> <b>"</b><u>boolean</u><b>"</b>
              Invert the X axis.  Default: off.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"InvY"</b> <b>"</b><u>boolean</u><b>"</b>
              Invert the Y axis.  Default: off.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"AngleOffset"</b> <b>"</b><u>integer</u><b>"</b>
              Specify  a  clockwise  angular  offset  (in  degrees)  to  apply  to  the  pointer  motion.   This
              transformation is applied before the <b>FlipXY</b>, <b>InvX</b> and <b>InvY</b> transformations.  Default: 0.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"SampleRate"</b> <b>"</b><u>integer</u><b>"</b>
              Sets the number of motion/button events  the  mouse  sends  per  second.   Setting  this  is  only
              supported  for  some  mice,  including  some  Logitech  mice and some PS/2 mice on some platforms.
              Default: whatever the mouse is already set to.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"Resolution"</b> <b>"</b><u>integer</u><b>"</b>
              Sets the resolution of the device in counts per inch.  Setting this is  only  supported  for  some
              mice, including some PS/2 mice on some platforms.  Default: whatever the mouse is already set to.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"Sensitivity"</b> <b>"</b><u>float</u><b>"</b>
              Mouse  movements  are  multiplied by this float before being processed. Use this mechanism to slow
              down high resolution mice. Because values bigger than 1.0 will result in not  all  pixels  on  the
              screen  being  accessible, you should better use mouse acceleration (see <b>man</b> <b>xset</b>) for speeding up
              low resolution mice.  Default: 1.0

       <b>Option</b> <b>"DragLockButtons"</b> <b>"</b><u>L1</u> <u>B2</u> <u>L3</u> <u>B4</u><b>"</b>
              Sets "drag lock buttons" that simulate holding a button down, so that low dexterity people do  not
              have  to  hold  a  button  down at the same time they move a mouse cursor. Button numbers occur in
              pairs, with the lock button number occurring first, followed by the  button  number  that  is  the
              target of the lock button.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"DragLockButtons"</b> <b>"</b><u>M1</u><b>"</b>
              Sets a "master drag lock button" that acts as a "Meta Key" indicating that the next button pressed
              is to be "drag locked".

       <b>Option</b> <b>"ClearDTR"</b> <b>"</b><u>boolean</u><b>"</b>
              Enable/disable  clearing  the  DTR  line on the serial port used by the mouse.  Some dual-protocol
              mice require the DTR line to be cleared to operate in the non-default protocol.   This  option  is
              for serial mice only and is handled by the X server.  Default: off.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"ClearRTS"</b> <b>"</b><u>boolean</u><b>"</b>
              Enable/disable  clearing  the  RTS  line on the serial port used by the mouse.  Some dual-protocol
              mice require the RTS line to be cleared to operate in the non-default protocol.   This  option  is
              for serial mice only and is handled by the X server.  Default: off.

       <b>Option</b> <b>"BaudRate"</b> <b>"</b><u>integer</u><b>"</b>
              Set  the  baud  rate  to  use for communicating with a serial mouse.  This option should rarely be
              required because the default is correct for almost all situations.   Valid  values  include:  300,
              1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200.  Default: 1200.

       There  are  some  other  options  that  may  be  used  to  control  various  parameters  for  serial port
       communication, but they are not documented here because the driver sets them  correctly  for  each  mouse
       protocol type.
