</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  describes  the standard programming interface to configure and retrieve status information
       for IEEE 802.11 devices that depend on the <u><a href="../man4/wlan.4.html">wlan</a></u>(4) module for operation.  The interface is via one of the
       following <u><a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</a></u>(2) calls on a socket:

       SIOCG80211  Get configuration or status information.

       SIOCS80211  Set configuration information.

       These requests are made via a modified <u>ifreq</u> structure.  This structure is defined as follows:

       struct ieee80211req {
               char            i_name[IFNAMSIZ];       /* if_name, e.g. "wi0" */
               uint16_t        i_type;                 /* req type */
               int16_t         i_val;                  /* Index or simple value */
               int16_t         i_len;                  /* Index or simple value */
               void            *i_data;                /* Extra data */
       };

       Requests that are not supported by the underlying device return -1 and set the global variable  errno  to
       EOPNOTSUPP.   SIOCG80211  requests that return data to an application place small values in <u>i_val</u> or in a
       user-specified buffer pointed to by <u>i_data</u>.  When an indirect buffer is used <u>i_len</u>  specifies  how  large
       the  indirect  buffer  is  and  on  return it is set by the system to the actual amount of data returned.
       SIOCS80211 requests use a similar scheme with data passed to the system taken either  from  <u>i_val</u>  or  an
       indirect buffer pointed to by <u>i_data</u>.

       For SIOCG80211 the following values of <u>i_type</u> are valid:

       IEEE80211_IOC_AMPDU
               Return  whether or not AMPDU is enabled in <u>i_val</u>.  AMPDU is an aggregation scheme that is part of
               the 802.11n specification and is used only when operating on an HT channel.  The  value  returned
               is one of: 0 (AMPDU disabled), 1 (AMPDU enabled for transmit), 2 (AMPDU enabled for receive), and
               3  (AMPDU  enabled for transmit and receive).  The 802.11n specification says a compliant station
               must receive AMPDU but may not support transmitting AMPDU frames.   Disabling  AMPDU  receive  is
               mainly useful for testing and working around bugs.

       IEEE80211_IOC_AMPDU_DENSITY
               Return  the  minimum density for bursting AMPDU frames in <u>i_val</u>.  The value returned is one of: 0
               (no time restriction), 1 (1/4 usec), 2 (1/2 usec), 3 (1 usec), 4 (2  usec),  5  (4  usec),  6  (8
               usec), and 7 (16 usec).

       IEEE80211_IOC_AMPDU_LIMIT
               Return  the  limit  on  the  size  of  AMPDU frames in <u>i_val</u>.  The value returned is one of: 0 (8
               kilobytes), 1 (16 kilobytes), 2 (32 kilobytes), and 3 (64 kilobytes).

       IEEE80211_IOC_AMSDU
               Return whether or not AMSDU is enabled in <u>i_val</u>.  AMSDU is an aggregation scheme that is part  of
               the  802.11n  specification and is used only when operating on an HT channel.  The value returned
               is one of: 0 (AMSDU disabled), 1 (AMSDU enabled for transmit), 2 (AMSDU enabled for receive), and
               3 (AMSDU enabled for transmit and receive).  The 802.11n specification says a  compliant  station
               must  receive  AMSDU  but  may not support transmitting AMSDU frames.  Disabling AMSDU receive is
               mainly useful for testing and working around bugs.

       IEEE80211_IOC_AMSDU_LIMIT
               Return the limit on the size of AMSDU frames in <u>i_val</u>.   The  value  returned  is  one  of:  3839
               (bytes)  and  7935 (bytes).  Note these values are specified by 802.11n; arbitrary values are not
               allowed.

       IEEE80211_IOC_APBRIDGE
               Return whether AP  bridging  is  enabled  in  <u>i_val</u>.   Normally  packets  sent  between  stations
               associated  to  the  same  access point are delivered without going through system layers that do
               packet filtering; when AP bridging is disabled packets are passed up the system to  be  forwarded
               using  some  other  mechanism.   This  value  will  be  non-zero  when AP bridging is enabled and
               otherwise zero.

       IEEE80211_IOC_APPIE
               Return an application information element via <u>i_data</u>.  Application IE's are maintained  for  many
               802.11 frames; the request must identify the frame to return an IE for in <u>i_val</u>.  For example, to
               retrieve  the  IE  sent in each Beacon frame <u>i_val</u> would be set to <u>IEEE80211_FC0_SUBTYPE_BEACON</u> |
               <u>IEEE80211_FC0_TYPE_MGT</u>.  If no information element is installed then EINVAL is returned.  If  the
               data  buffer  for  returning  data  is  too  small  to  hold the information element the value is
               truncated; this permits querying the presence of  data  by  requesting  zero  bytes  of  data  be
               returned.

       IEEE80211_IOC_AUTHMODE
               Return  the  current  authentication  mode  in  <u>i_val</u>.   Valid values are IEEE80211_AUTH_NONE (no
               authentication), IEEE80211_AUTH_OPEN (open  authentication),  IEEE80211_AUTH_SHARED  (shared  key
               authentication),   IEEE80211_AUTH_8021X  (802.1x  only  authentication),  and  IEEE80211_AUTH_WPA
               (WPA/802.11i/802.1x authentication).

       IEEE80211_IOC_BEACON_INTERVAL
               Return the time between Beacon frames (in TU) in <u>i_val</u>.

       IEEE80211_IOC_BGSCAN
               Return whether background scanning is  enabled  in  <u>i_val</u>.   When  this  value  is  non-zero  and
               operating  in  station  mode the station will periodically leave the current channel and scan for
               neighboring stations.  See also IEEE80211_IOC_BGSCAN_IDLE and IEEE80211_IOC_BGSCAN_INTERVAL.

       IEEE80211_IOC_BGSCAN_IDLE
               Return in <u>i_val</u> the minimum time (msecs) a  station  must  be  idle  (i.e.  not  transmitting  or
               receiving frames) before it will do a background scan.  See also IEEE80211_IOC_BGSCAN_INTERVAL.

       IEEE80211_IOC_BGSCAN_INTERVAL
               Return  in  <u>i_val</u>  the  minimum  time  (seconds)  between  background  scan operations.  See also
               IEEE80211_IOC_BGSCAN_IDLE.

       IEEE80211_IOC_BMISSTHRESHOLD
               Return in <u>i_val</u> the number of consecutive missed Beacon frames before the system will attempt  to
               roam to a different/better access point.

       IEEE80211_IOC_BSSID
               Return the MAC address for the current BSS identifier via <u>i_data</u>.  When the interface is running,
               the  bssid  is either the value configured locally (e.g. for an IBSS network started by the local
               station) or the value adopted when joining an existing network.  For WDS interfaces this value is
               the address of the remote station.  When the interface is not running, the bssid returned is  the
               desired bssid, if any, that has been configured.

       IEEE80211_IOC_BURST
               Return  whether  or  not packet bursting is enabled in <u>i_val</u>.  If this value is non-zero then the
               system will try to send packets closely spaced to improve throughput.

       IEEE80211_IOC_CHANINFO
               Return the set of available channels  via  <u>i_data</u>.   Note  this  data  should  be  used  by  user
               applications  to  map  between channel specifications (frequency and attributes) and IEEE channel
               numbers as user applications may not have the necessary information to do this directly (e.g. for
               900MHz radios, operation in the Public Safety Band).

       IEEE80211_IOC_CHANLIST
               Return the current list of usable channels via <u>i_data</u>.  The channel list is  returned  as  a  bit
               vector with bit N set to 1 if IEEE channel number N is available for use.

       IEEE80211_IOC_CHANNEL
               Return the IEEE channel number of the current channel in <u>i_val</u>.  Note this request is deprecated;
               use IEEE80211_IOC_CURCHAN instead.

       IEEE80211_IOC_COUNTERMEASURES
               Return  whether  TKIP  Countermeasures  are  enabled  in <u>i_val</u>.  This value will be non-zero when
               Countermeasures are enabled and otherwise zero.

       IEEE80211_IOC_CURCHAN
               Return information for the current channel  via  <u>i_data</u>.   This  information  includes  the  IEEE
               channel  number,  the  frequency,  and  attributes  that describe the operating constraints (e.g.
               Passive Scan, DFS, usage restrictions).

       IEEE80211_IOC_DEVCAPS
               Return device capabilities in the data buffer pointed at by <u>i_data</u>.  The  buffer  must  be  large
               enough  to  return  the number of available channels but otherwise may be made small to limit how
               much information is returned.

       IEEE80211_IOC_DFS
               Return whether or not Dynamic Frequency Selection  (DFS)  is  enabled  in  <u>i_val</u>.   DFS  embodies
               several  facilities  including  detection  of  overlapping  radar signals, dynamic transmit power
               control, and channel selection according to a least-congested criteria.  DFS support is mandatory
               for some 5GHz frequencies in certain locales (e.g. ETSI).  By default DFS is enabled according to
               the regulatory definitions and the current country code, regdomain, and channel.

       IEEE80211_IOC_DOTD
               Return whether or not 802.11d support is enabled in <u>i_val</u>.  When 802.11d is  enabled  in  station
               mode, Beacon frames that advertise a country code different than the currently configured country
               code  will  cause  an event to be dispatched to user applications.  This event can be used by the
               station  to  adopt  that  country  code  and  operate  according  to  the  associated  regulatory
               constraints.  When operating as an access point with 802.11d enabled the Beacon and ProbeResponse
               frames transmitted will advertise the current regulatory domain settings.

       IEEE80211_IOC_DOTH
               Return  whether  802.11h  support  is  enabled  in  <u>i_val</u>.   When  802.11h  is enabled Beacon and
               ProbeResponse frames will have the SpectrumMgt bit set in the capabilities field and country  and
               power  constraint  information  elements will be present.  802.11h support also includes handling
               Channel Switch Announcements (CSA) which are a mechanism to  coordinate  channel  changes  by  an
               access point.  By default 802.11h is enabled if the device is capable.

       IEEE80211_IOC_DROPUNENCRYPTED
               Return,  in <u>i_val</u>, whether unencrypted packets transmit/received should be discarded.  This value
               will be zero if unencrypted packets will be accepted and non-zero if they are to be discarded.

       IEEE80211_IOC_DTIM_PERIOD
               Return the period (in beacon intervals) between DTIM events in <u>i_val</u>.

       IEEE80211_IOC_DWDS
               Return, in <u>i_val</u>, whether or not Dynamic WDS support is enabled.  Dynamic WDS is  a  facility  by
               which  packets  may be tunneled over normal Infrastructure BSS associations using 4-address (WDS)
               frames.

       IEEE80211_IOC_FF
               Return, in <u>i_val</u>, whether Atheros fast-frames support is enabled.  Fast-frames is a  non-standard
               protocol  extension  that  aggregates  multiple frames to improve throughput.  Note that enabling
               fast-frames support does not guarantee use; the client and access point must negotiate its use.

       IEEE80211_IOC_FRAGTHRESHOLD
               Return, in <u>i_val</u>, the threshold (in bytes) for enabling  fragmentation  frames.   Packets  larger
               than  this  value  will  automatically be split into multiple fragmented frames that are sent one
               after the other.

       IEEE80211_IOC_GREENFIELD
               Return, in <u>i_val</u>, whether or not Greenfield preamble use is enabled.  This  setting is meaningful
               only when operating with 802.11n on an HT channel.

       IEEE80211_IOC_HIDESSID
               Return, in <u>i_val</u>, whether SSID hiding/cloaking is enabled.  SSID hiding is only  meaningful  when
               operating  as  an  access  point.  When this is enabled Beacon frames do not include the SSID and
               ProbeRequest frames are not answered unless they include the AP's SSID.  This value will be  non-
               zero when SSID hiding is enabled and otherwise zero.

       IEEE80211_IOC_HTCOMPAT
               Return,  in <u>i_val</u>, whether or not 802.11n compatibility support is enabled.  The 802.11n protocol
               specification went through several incompatible iterations.  Some vendors implemented 11n support
               to older specifications that will not interoperate  with  a  purely  11n-compliant  station.   In
               particular  the information elements included in management frames for old devices are different.
               When compatibility support is enabled both standard and compatible data will be  provided  and/or
               accepted.

       IEEE80211_IOC_HTCONF
               Return  the  setting for automatic promotion of HT channels in <u>i_val</u>.  Promotion happens when the
               system must select a channel and may choose between legacy, HT20, and HT40 operation  (e.g.  when
               scanning).  Valid values are: 0 (do not promote, use legacy), 1 (promote to HT20), and 2 (promote
               to HT40).

       IEEE80211_IOC_HTPROTMODE
               Return,  in  <u>i_val</u>,  the  technique  used to protect HT frames in a mixed 802.11n network.  Valid
               values are: IEEE80211_PROTMODE_OFF (no protection enabled)  and  IEEE80211_PROTMODE_RTSCTS  (send
               RTS and wait for CTS).

       IEEE80211_IOC_HWMP_MAXHOPS
               Return the maximum acceptable hop count in an HWMP path in <u>i_val</u>.

       IEEE80211_IOC_HWMP_ROOTMODE
               Return   the   setting   for   Mesh   root   mode   operation   in   <u>i_val</u>.   Valid  values  are:
               IEEE80211_HWMP_ROOTMODE_DISABLED (root mode is  disabled),  IEEE80211_HWMP_ROOTMODE_NORMAL  (send
               broadcast  Path  Request  frames), IEEE80211_HWMP_ROOTMODE_PROACTIVE (send broadcast Path Request
               frames and force replies) and  IEEE80211_HWMP_ROOTMODE_RANN  (send  broadcast  Root  Announcement
               (RANN) frames).

       IEEE80211_IOC_IC_NAME
               Return  the  underlying  hardware  <u><a href="../man9/device.9.html">device</a></u>(9) name in the buffer pointed to by <u>i_data</u> and the name
               length including terminating NUL character in <u>i_len</u>.  If the buffer length is too small  to  hold
               the full name EINVAL will be returned.

       IEEE80211_IOC_INACTIVITY
               Return  whether  or  not  the  system  handles  inactivity  processing in <u>i_val</u>.  When inactivity
               processing is enabled the system will  track  stations  that  have  not  transmitted  frames  and
               periodically  probe  them  to check if they are still present.  Stations that are inactive and do
               not respond to probes are dropped.

       IEEE80211_IOC_MACCMD
               Return information about the state of the MAC address access control list  (ACL)  system.   There
               are  two  requests supported: IEEE80211_MACCMD_POLICY (to retrieve the current policy in <u>i_val</u> <u>),</u>
               and  IEEE80211_MACCMD_LIST  to  retrieve  the  list  installed/active  ACL's  via  <u>i_data</u>.    The
               <u><a href="../man4/wlan_acl.4.html">wlan_acl</a></u>(4) module must be installed and enabled or EINVAL will be returned.

       IEEE80211_IOC_MESH_AP
               Return whether or not Mesh AP support is enabled in <u>i_val</u>.

       IEEE80211_IOC_MESH_ID
               Return the Mesh ID in the buffer pointed to by <u>i_data</u>.

       IEEE80211_IOC_MESH_FWRD
               Return whether or not packet forwarding support is enabled in <u>i_val</u>.

       IEEE80211_IOC_MESH_PP_METRIC
               Return the link metric protocol in the buffer pointed to by <u>i_data</u>.

       IEEE80211_IOC_MESH_PP_PATH
               Return the path selection protocol in the buffer pointed to by <u>i_data</u>.

       IEEE80211_IOC_MESH_RTCMD
               Return  information  about  the  state  of  the  Mesh  routing tables.  One request is supported:
               IEEE80211_MESH_RTCMD_LIST to retrieve the contents of the routing table in the buffer pointed  to
               by <u>i_data</u>.

       IEEE80211_IOC_MESH_TTL
               Return,  in  <u>i_val</u>,  the Mesh Time To Live (TTL) setting installed in packets transmitted by this
               mesh node.

       IEEE80211_IOC_NUMSSIDS
               Return the number of SSIDs supported in <u>i_val</u>.

       IEEE80211_IOC_NUMWEPKEYS
               Return the number of WEP keys supported in <u>i_val</u>.

       IEEE80211_IOC_POWERSAVE
               Return the current powersaving mode in <u>i_val</u>.  Valid values  are  IEEE80211_POWERSAVE_OFF  (power
               save operation is disabled) and IEEE80211_POWERSAVE_ON (power save operation is enabled).

       IEEE80211_IOC_POWERSAVESLEEP
               Return  the  powersave  sleep time in TU in <u>i_val</u>.  This value is also termed the listen interval
               and represents the maximum time a station will sleep before waking to retrieve  packets  buffered

               Return whether ``pure 11g'' mode is enabled in <u>i_val</u>.  This setting is meaningful only for access
               point operation; when non-zero, 802.11b stations will not be allowed to associate.

       IEEE80211_IOC_PUREN
               Return whether ``pure 11n'' mode is enabled in <u>i_val</u>.  This setting is meaningful only for access
               point operation; when non-zero,  legacy  (non-11n  capable)  stations  will  not  be  allowed  to
               associate.

               enabled), and IEEE80211_HTCAP_SMPS_OFF (SMPS is disabled).

       IEEE80211_IOC_SSID
               Return  the  requested SSID in the buffer pointed to by <u>i_data</u>.  If <u>i_val</u> is ≥ 0 then the request
               refers to the configured value for that slot.  Generally, 0 is the only  valid  value,  but  some
               interfaces support more SSIDs.

               Return  information  about  the  current  state  of the specified station(s) via <u>i_data</u>.  The MAC
               address of a single station  may  be  passed  in  or,  if  the  broadcast  address  is  supplied,
               information  about  all  stations will be returned.  If a single station is requested and the MAC
               address is unknown then ENOENT will be returned.

       IEEE80211_IOC_STA_STATS
               Return collected statistics for the specified station via <u>i_data</u>.  The MAC address of the desired

               standard protocol extension available only on Atheros devices where channel width is  dynamically
               changed  between  20MHz  and  40MHz.   Note  that  enabling  Dynamic  Turbo mode support does not
               guarantee use; both client and access point must use Atheros devices and support must be  enabled
               on both sides.

               packets  sent  and  received), IEEE80211_WEP_OFF (disabled), and IEEE80211_WEP_MIXED (enabled for
               transmit and  receive  but  also  willing  to  receive  unencrypted  frames).   This  request  is
               deprecated; use IEEE80211_IOC_PRIVACY and IEEE80211_IOC_UNENCRYPTED instead.

       IEEE80211_IOC_WEPKEY

               through <u>i_data</u> identifies the MAC address of the desired station.  If an RSN (802.11i) element is
               present it is returned; otherwise any WPA element is returned.  Note this request is  deprecated;
               use IEEE80211_IOC_WPAIE2 instead.

       IEEE80211_IOC_WPAIE2
               Return  any WPA information elements for an associated station via <u>i_data</u>.  The request passed in
               through <u>i_data</u> identifies the MAC address of the desired station.  One or both of  RSN  (802.11i)

       For SIOCS80211 the following values of <u>i_type</u> are valid.  Note that changing a value on an interface that
       is running may cause the interface to be ‘reset’.  Resets may be handled without altering  the  state  if
       the  parameter  does  not affect the MLME state (e.g. RTS threshold), but in some cases the interface may
       need to scan for a new network or clear state (including any  associated  stations);  in  that  case  the
       interface  is  said  to be ‘restarted’ (it is equivalent to marking the interface down and back up).  The
       information below identifies whether changing a value affects the state of a running interface.

       IEEE80211_IOC_CHANLIST
               Set the list of available channels using the channel list pointed to by <u>i_data</u>.  The channel list
               is a bit vector with bit N set to 1 if IEEE channel number N is available for use.  The specified
               channel  list is checked against the set of supported channels and any channels not supported are
               silently ignored.  If the intersection of the channel list and the supported  channels  is  empty
               EINVAL  is  returned.   Note  the  current  channel  may be marked invalid after installing a new
               channel list.  This request causes a running interface to be restarted.
