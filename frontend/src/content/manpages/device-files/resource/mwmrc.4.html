</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mwmrc</b> — the Motif Window Manager Resource Description File

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>mwmrc</b>  file  is a supplementary resource file that controls much of the behavior of the Motif window
       manager <b>mwm</b>.  It contains descriptions of resources that cannot easily be written using standard X Window
       System, Version 11 resource syntax. The resource description file contains entries that are  referred  to
       by  X  resources  in  defaults  files (for example, <b>/etc/X11/app-defaults/Mwm</b>) or in the <b>RESOURCE_MANAGER</b>
       property on the root window. For example, the resource description file enables you to specify  different
       types  of  window menus; however, an X resource is used to specify which of these window menus <b>mwm</b> should
       use for a particular window.

   <b>Location</b>
       The window manager searches for one of the following resource description files, where <u>$LANG</u> is the value
       of the language environment on a per-user basis:

       $HOME/$LANG/.mwmrc
       $HOME/.mwmrc
       /etc/X11/mwm/$LANG/system.mwmrc
       /etc/X11/mwm/system.mwmrc

       The first file found is the first used. If no file is found, a set of built-in specifications is used.  A
       particular  resource  description file can be selected using the <u>configFile</u> resource. The following shows
       how a different resource description file can be specified from the command line:

       /usr/bin/mwm -xrm "mwm*configFile: mymwmrc"

   <b>Resource</b> <b>Types</b>
       The following types of resources can be described in the mwm resource description file:

       <b>Buttons</b>   Window manager functions can be bound (associated) with button events.

       <b>Keys</b>      Window manager functions can be bound (associated) with key press events.

       <b>Menus</b>     Menu panes can be used for the window menu and other menus posted with key bindings and  button
                 bindings.

</pre><h4><b>MWM</b> <b>RESOURCE</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>mwm</b> resource description file is a standard text file that contains items of information separated by
       blanks,  tabs,  and  new  lines characters. Blank lines are ignored. Items or characters can be quoted to
       avoid special interpretation (for example, the comment character can be quoted to prevent it  from  being
       interpreted  as  the  comment character).  A quoted item can be contained in double quotes (<b>"</b> <b>"</b>).  Single
       characters can be quoted by preceding them by the back-slash character (<b>\</b>). If a line ends with  a  back-
       slash, the next line is considered a continuation of that line. All text from an unquoted <b>#</b> to the end of
       the  line  is regarded as a comment and is not interpreted as part of a resource description. If <b>!</b> is the
       first character in a line, the line is regarded as a comment.

   <b>Window</b> <b>Manager</b> <b>Functions</b>
       Window manager functions can be accessed with button and key bindings, and  with  window  manager  menus.
       Functions  are  indicated  as part of the specifications for button and key binding sets, and menu panes.
       The function specification has the following syntax:

       <b>function</b> = <b>function_name</b> [<b>function_args</b>]
       <b>function_name</b> = <b>window</b> <b>manager</b> <b>function</b>
       <b>function_args</b> = {<b>quoted_item</b> | <b>unquoted_item</b>}

       The following functions are supported. If a function  is  specified  that  isn't  one  of  the  supported
       functions then it is interpreted by <b>mwm</b> as <b>f.nop</b>.

       <b>f.beep</b>    This function causes a beep.

       <b>f.circle_down</b> [ <u>icon</u> | <u>window</u>]
                 This function causes the window or icon that is on the top of the window stack to be put on the
                 bottom  of  the window stack (so that it is no longer obscuring any other window or icon). This
                 function affects only those windows and icons that are obscuring other windows  and  icons,  or
                 that  are  obscured  by other windows and icons. Secondary windows (that is, transient windows)
                 are restacked with their associated primary window. Secondary windows always stay on top of the
                 associated primary window and there can be no  other  primary  windows  between  the  secondary
                 windows  and their primary window. If an <u>icon</u> function argument is specified, then the function
                 applies only to icons. If a <u>window</u> function argument is specified  then  the  function  applies
                 only to windows.

       <b>f.circle_up</b> [ <u>icon</u> | <u>window</u>]
                 This  function  raises  the window or icon on the bottom of the window stack (so that it is not
                 obscured by any other windows). This function affects only those windows  and  icons  that  are
                 obscuring  other  windows and icons, or that are obscured by other windows and icons. Secondary
                 windows (that is, transient windows) are restacked with their associated primary window. If  an
                 <u>icon</u>  function  argument  is  specified  then  the function applies only to icons. If an <u>window</u>
                 function argument is specified then the function applies only to windows.

       <b>f.exec</b> <b>command</b> (or <u>!</u> <b>command</b>)
                 This function causes <u>command</u> to be executed  (using  the  value  of  the  <u>$MWMSHELL</u>  or  <u>$SHELL</u>
                 environment  variable  if set; otherwise, <b><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></b> ). The <u>!</u> notation can be used in place of the
                 <b>f.exec</b> function name.

       <b>f.focus_color</b>
                 This function sets the colormap focus to a client window. If this function is done  in  a  root
                 context,  then  the  default colormap (setup by the X Window System for the screen where <b>mwm</b> is
                 running) is installed and there is no specific client window colormap focus. This  function  is
                 treated as <b>f.nop</b> if <u>colormapFocusPolicy</u> is not explicit.

       <b>f.focus_key</b>
                 This  function  sets  the  keyboard  input  focus to a client window or icon.  This function is
                 treated as <b>f.nop</b> if <u>keyboardFocusPolicy</u> is not explicit or the function is executed in  a  root
                 context.

       <b>f.kill</b>    This  function  is used to close application windows. The actual processing that occurs depends
                 on the protocols that the application observes. The application lists the protocols it observes
                 in the <b>WM_PROTOCOLS</b> property  on  its  top  level  window.  If  the  application  observes  the
                 <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b>  protocol,  it  is sent a message that requests the window be deleted.  If the
                 application observes both  <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b>  and  <b>WM_SAVE_YOURSELF</b>,  it  is  sent  one  message
                 requesting  the  window  be  deleted  and another message advising it to save its state. If the
                 application observes only the <b>WM_SAVE_YOURSELF</b>protocol <u>,</u> it is sent a message  advising  it  to
                 save  its  state.  After  a  delay  (specified  by the resource <u>quitTimeout</u>), the application's
                 connection to the X server  is  terminated.  If  the  application  observes  neither  of  these
                 protocols, its connection to the X server is terminated.

       <b>f.lower</b> [<u>-</u> <b>client</b> | <u>within</u> | <u>freeFamily</u>]
                 This  function  lowers  a  primary  window  to  the bottom of the global window stack (where it
                 obscures no other window) and lowers the secondary window  (transient  window  or  dialog  box)
                 within  the  client  family.  The arguments to this function are mutually exclusive. The <u>client</u>
                 argument indicates the name or class of a client to lower.  The  name  or  class  of  a  client
                 appears  in  the  <b>WM_CLASS</b> property on the client's top-level window. If the <u>client</u> argument is
                 not specified, the context that the function was invoked in indicates the  window  or  icon  to
                 lower.  Specifying  <u>within</u>  lowers  the  secondary  window within the family (staying above the
                 parent) but does not lower the client family in the global window stack. Specifying  <u>freeFamily</u>
                 lowers the window to the bottom of the global windows stack from its local family stack.

       <b>f.maximize</b>
                 This  function  causes  a  client  window  to  be displayed with its maximum size. Refer to the
                 <u>maximumClientSize</u>, <u>maximumMaximumSize</u>, and <u>limitResize</u> resources in <b><a href="../man1/mwm.1.html">mwm</a></b>(1).

       <b>f.menu</b> <u>menu_name</u>
                 This function associates a cascading (pull-right) menu with a menu pane entry or a menu with  a
                 button or key binding. The <u>menu_name</u> function argument identifies the menu to be used.

       <b>f.minimize</b>
                 This  function  causes  a client window to be minimized (iconified). When a window is minimized
                 with no icon box in use, and if the <u>lowerOnIconify</u> resource has the value True  (the  default),
                 the  icon  is placed on the bottom of the window stack (such that it obscures no other window).
                 If an icon box is used, then the client's icon changes to its iconified form  inside  the  icon
                 box. Secondary windows (that is, transient windows) are minimized with their associated primary
                 window. There is only one icon for a primary window and all its secondary windows.

       <b>f.move</b>    This function initiates an interactive move of a client window.

       <b>f.next_cmap</b>
                 This  function  installs  the  next  colormap  in the list of colormaps for the window with the
                 colormap focus.

       <b>f.next_key</b> [ <u>icon</u> | <u>window</u> | <u>transient</u>]
                 This function sets the keyboard input focus to the next window/icon in the set of windows/icons
                 managed by the window manager (the ordering of this set is based on the stacking of windows  on
                 the  screen).  This  function  is  treated as <b>f.nop</b> if <b>keyboardFocusPolicy</b> is not explicit. The
                 keyboard input focus is only moved to windows that do not have an associated  secondary  window
                 that  is  application modal. If the <u>transient</u> argument is specified, then transient (secondary)
                 windows are traversed (otherwise, if only <u>window</u> is specified, traversal is done  only  to  the
                 last  focused window in a transient group). If an <u>icon</u> function argument is specified, then the
                 function applies only to icons. If a <u>window</u> function argument is specified, then  the  function
                 applies only to windows.

       <b>f.nop</b>     This function does nothing.

       <b>f.normalize</b>
                 This  function  causes  a client window to be displayed with its normal size. Secondary windows
                 (that is, transient windows) are placed in their  normal  state  along  with  their  associated
                 primary window.

       <b>f.normalize_and_raise</b>
                 This function causes a client window to be displayed with its normal size and raised to the top
                 of  the window stack. Secondary windows (that is, transient windows) are placed in their normal
                 state along with their associated primary window.

       <b>f.pack_icons</b>
                 This function is used to relayout icons (based on the layout policy being  used)  on  the  root
                 window or in the icon box. In general this causes icons to be "packed" into the icon grid.

       <b>f.pass_keys</b>
                 This  function is used to enable/disable (toggle) processing of key bindings for window manager
                 functions. When it disables key binding processing all keys are passed on to  the  window  with
                 the  keyboard  input  focus  and  no  window  manager functions are invoked. If the <b>f.pass_keys</b>
                 function is invoked with a key binding to disable key binding processing the same  key  binding
                 can be used to enable key binding processing.

       <b>f.post_wmenu</b>
                 This  function  is used to post the window menu. If a key is used to post the window menu and a
                 window menu button is present, the window menu is automatically placed with its top-left corner
                 at the bottom-left corner of the window menu button for the client window. If  no  window  menu
                 button is present, the window menu is placed at the top-left corner of the client window.

       <b>f.prev_cmap</b>
                 This  function  installs the previous colormap in the list of colormaps for the window with the
                 colormap focus.

       <b>f.prev_key</b> [ <u>icon</u> | <u>window</u> | <u>transient</u>]
                 This function sets the keyboard  input  focus  to  the  previous  window/icon  in  the  set  of
                 windows/icons  managed by the window manager (the ordering of this set is based on the stacking
                 of windows on the screen). This function is treated as  <b>f.nop</b>  if  <u>keyboardFocusPolicy</u>  is  not
                 explicit.  The  keyboard  input  focus  is only moved to windows that do not have an associated
                 secondary window that is application modal.  If  the  <u>transient</u>  argument  is  specified,  then
                 transient  (secondary) windows are traversed (otherwise, if only <u>window</u> is specified, traversal
                 is done only to the last focused window in a transient group). If an <u>icon</u> function argument  is
                 specified  then the function applies only to icons. If an <u>window</u> function argument is specified
                 then the function applies only to windows.

       <b>f.quit_mwm</b>
                 This function terminates mwm (but NOT the X window system).

       <b>f.raise</b> [<u>-client</u> | <u>within</u> | <u>freeFamily</u>]
                 This function raises a primary window to the top of  the  global  window  stack  (where  it  is
                 obscured  by  no other window) and raises the secondary window (transient window or dialog box)
                 within the client family. The arguments to this function are  mutually  exclusive.  The  <u>client</u>
                 argument  indicates the name or class of a client to lower. If the <u>client</u> is not specified, the
                 context that the function was invoked in indicates the window  or  icon  to  lower.  Specifying
                 <u>within</u>  raises  the  secondary window within the family but does not raise the client family in
                 the global window stack. Specifying <u>freeFamily</u> raises the window to the top of its local family
                 stack and raises the family to the top of the global window stack.

       <b>f.raise_lower</b> [ <u>within</u> | <u>freeFamily</u>]
                 This function raises a primary window to the top of the global window stack if it is  partially
                 obscured  by another window; otherwise, it lowers the window to the bottom of the window stack.
                 The arguments to this function are mutually exclusive. Specifying  <u>within</u>  raises  a  secondary
                 window  within  the  family  (staying  above the parent window), if it is partially obscured by
                 another window in the application's family; otherwise, it lowers the window to  the  bottom  of
                 the  family  stack. It has no effect on the global window stacking order. Specifying <u>freeFamily</u>
                 raises the window to the top of its local family stack, if  obscured  by  another  window,  and
                 raises the family to the top of the global window stack; otherwise, it lowers the window to the
                 bottom  of  its  local  family  stack  and lowers the family to the bottom of the global window
                 stack.

       <b>f.refresh</b> This function causes all windows to be redrawn.

       <b>f.refresh_win</b>
                 This function causes a client window to be redrawn.

       <b>f.resize</b>  This function initiates an interactive resize of a client window.

       <b>f.restore</b> This function restores the previous state of an  icon's  associated  window.   If  a  maximized
                 window  is  iconified, then <b>f.restore</b> restores it to its maximized state. If a normal window is
                 iconified, then <b>f.restore</b> restores it to its normalized state.

       <b>f.restore_and_raise</b>
                 This function restores the previous state of an icon's associated window and raises the  window
                 to  the  top  of the window stack. If a maximized window is iconified, then <b>f.restore_and_raise</b>
                 restores it to its maximized state and raises it to the top of the window stack.  If  a  normal
                 window is iconified, then <b>f.restore_and_raise</b> restores it to its normalized state and raises it
                 to the top of the window stack.

       <b>f.restart</b> This  function  causes mwm to be restarted (effectively terminated and re-executed). Restart is
                 necessary for <b>mwm</b> to incorporate changes in both the <b>mwmrc</b> file and X resources.

       <b>f.screen</b> [ <u>next</u> | <u>prev</u> | <u>back</u> | <u>screen_number</u>]
                 This function causes the pointer to be warp to  a  specific  screen  number  or  to  the  <u>next</u>,
                 <u>previous</u>, or last visited (<u>back</u>) screen. The arguments to this function are mutually exclusive.
                 The  <u>screen_number</u>  argument  indicates  the  screen  number  that the pointer is to be warped.
                 Screens are numbered starting from screen 0. Specifying <u>next</u> cause the pointer to warp  to  the
                 next managed screen (skipping over any unmanaged screens). Specifying <u>prev</u> cause the pointer to
                 warp  to  the  previous  managed  screen (skipping over any unmanaged screens). Specifying <u>back</u>
                 cause the pointer to warp to the last visited screen.

       <b>f.send_msg</b> <u>message_number</u>
                 This function sends an <b>XClientMessageEvent</b> of type <b>_MOTIF_WM_MESSAGES</b> with <u>message_type</u> set  to
                 <u>message_number</u>.   The client message is sent only if <u>message_number</u> is included in the client's
                 <b>_MOTIF_WM_MESSAGES</b> property. A menu item label is grayed out if the menu item  is  used  to  do
                 <b>f.send_msg</b> of a message that is not included in the client's <b>_MOTIF_WM_MESSAGES</b> property.

       <b>f.separator</b>
                 This function causes a menu separator to be put in the menu pane at the specified location (the
                 label is ignored).

       <b>f.set_behavior</b>
                 This  function  causes  the  window  manager  to restart with the default behavior (if a custom
                 behavior is configured) or a custom behavior (if a default behavior is configured). By  default
                 this is bound to <u>Shift</u> <u>Ctrl</u> <u>Alt</u> <u>&lt;Key&gt;!</u>.

       <b>f.title</b>   This function inserts a title in the menu pane at the specified location.

       <b>f.version</b> This function causes the window manager to display its release version in a dialog box.

   <b>Function</b> <b>Constraints</b>
       Each  function  may be constrained as to which resource types can specify the function (for example, menu
       pane) and also what context the function can be used in  (for  example,  the  function  is  done  to  the
       selected client window).  Function contexts are:

       <u>root</u>      No client window or icon has been selected as an object for the function.

       <u>window</u>    A  client  window  has  been selected as an object for the function. This includes the window's
                 title bar and frame. Some functions are applied only when the window is in its normalized state
                 (for example, <b>f.maximize</b>) or its maximized state (for example, <b>f.normalize</b>).

       <u>icon</u>      An icon has been selected as an object for the function.

       If a function is specified in a type of resource where it is not supported or is  invoked  in  a  context
       that  does  not  apply  then the function is treated as <b>f.nop</b>. The following table indicates the resource
       types and function contexts in which window manager functions apply.

</pre><h4><b>WINDOW</b> <b>MANAGER</b> <b>EVENT</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       Events are indicated as part of the specifications for button and  key  binding  sets,  and  menu  panes.
       Button events have the following syntax:

       <b>button</b> =~[<b>modifier_list</b> ]<u>&lt;</u><b>button_event_name</b> <u>&gt;</u>
       <b>modifier_list</b> =~<b>modifier_name</b> { <b>modifier_name</b>}

       The  following  table indicates the values that can be used for <b>modifier_name</b>. Note that [Alt] and [Meta]
       can be used interchangeably on some hardware.

       Modifier      Description
       ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       Ctrl          Control Key
       Shift         Shift Key

       Mod3          Modifier3
       Mod4          Modifier4
       Mod5          Modifier5

       Locking modifiers are ignored when processing button and key bindings.  The following  table  lists  keys
       that are interpreted as locking modifiers.  The X server may map some of these symbols to the Mod1 - Mod5
       modifier  keys.  These keys may or may not be available on your hardware: Key Symbol Caps Lock Shift Lock
       Kana Lock Num Lock  Scroll  Lock  The  following  table  indicates  the  values  that  can  be  used  for
       <b>button_event_name</b>.

       Key  events  that  are  used  by  the window manager for menu mnemonics and for binding to window manager
       functions are single key presses; key releases are ignored. Key events have the following syntax:

       <b>key</b> =~[<b>modifier_list</b>] <b>&lt;Key&gt;key_name</b>
       <b>modifier_list</b> =~<b>modifier_name</b> { <b>modifier_name</b>}

       All modifiers specified are interpreted as being exclusive (this means that only the specified  modifiers
       can  be  present  when  the  key  event  occurs).  Modifiers for keys are the same as those that apply to
       buttons. The <b>key_name</b> is an X11 keysym name. Keysym names can be found in the  <b>keysymdef.h</b>  file  (remove
       the <b>XK_</b> prefix).

</pre><h4><b>BUTTON</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>buttonBindings</b>  resource  value  is  the name of a set of button bindings that are used to configure
       window manager behavior.  A window manager function can be done when  a  button  press  occurs  with  the
       pointer  over  a  framed  client window, an icon or the root window. The context for indicating where the
       button press applies is also the context for invoking the window manager function when the  button  press
       is done (significant for functions that are context sensitive). The button binding syntax is

       <u>Buttons</u> <b>bindings_set_name</b>
       <u>{</u>
           <b>button</b>    <b>context</b>    <b>function</b>
           <b>button</b>    <b>context</b>    <b>function</b>
           ...
           <b>button</b>    <b>context</b>    <b>function</b>
       <u>}</u>

       The  syntax for the <b>context</b> specification is: <b>context</b> = <b>object</b>[<u>|</u> <b>context</b>] <b>object</b> = <u>root</u> | <u>icon</u> | <u>window</u> |
       <u>title</u> | <u>frame</u> | <u>border</u> | <u>app</u> The context specification indicates where the pointer must be for the button
       binding to be effective. For example, a context of <u>window</u> indicates that  the  pointer  must  be  over  a
       client  window  or  window management frame for the button binding to be effective.  The <u>frame</u> context is
       for the window management frame around a client window (including the border and  titlebar),  the  <u>border</u>
       context  is  for  the  border part of the window management frame (not including the titlebar), the <u>title</u>
       context is for the title area of the window management frame, and the <u>app</u> context is for the  application
       window  (not  including  the  window  management  frame).  If an <b>f.nop</b> function is specified for a button
       binding, the button binding is not done.

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>keyBindings</b> resource value is the name of a set of key bindings that are  used  to  configure  window
       manager  behavior. A window manager function can be done when a particular key is pressed. The context in
       which the key binding applies is indicated in the key binding specification.  The valid contexts are  the
       same as those that apply to button bindings. The key binding syntax is:

       <u>Keys</u> <b>bindings_set_name</b>
       <u>{</u>
           <b>key</b>    <b>context</b>    <b>function</b>
           <b>key</b>    <b>context</b>    <b>function</b>
           ...
           <b>key</b>    <b>context</b>    <b>function</b>
       <u>}</u>

       If  an  <b>f.nop</b> function is specified for a key binding, the key binding is not done. If an <b>f.post_wmenu</b> or
       <b>f.menu</b> function is bound to a key, <b>mwm</b> automatically uses the same key for removing  the  menu  from  the
       screen  after  it has been popped up. The <b>context</b> specification syntax is the same as for button bindings
       with one addition. The context <u>ifkey</u> may be specified for binding keys that may not be available  on  all
       displays.   If  the  key  is  not  available  and if <u>ifkey</u> is in the context, then reporting of the error
       message to the error log is suppressed. This feature is useful for networked, heterogeneous environments.
       For key bindings, the <u>frame</u>, <u>title</u>, <u>border</u>, and <u>app</u> contexts are equivalent to the <u>window</u>  context.   The
       context  for  a  key  event is the window or icon that has the keyboard input focus (<u>root</u> if no window or
       icon has the keyboard input focus).

</pre><h4><b>MENU</b> <b>PANES</b></h4><pre>
       Menus can be popped up using the <b>f.post_wmenu</b> and <b>f.menu</b> window manager functions. The context for window
       manager functions that are done from a menu is <u>root</u>, <u>icon</u> or <u>window</u> depending on how the menu was  popped
       up.  In  the  case of the <u>window</u> menu or menus popped up with a key binding, the location of the keyboard
       input focus indicates the context. For menus popped up using a button binding, the context of the  button
       binding is the context of the menu. The menu pane specification syntax is:

       <u>Menu</u> <b>menu_name</b>
       <u>{</u>
           <b>label</b>  [<b>mnemonic</b>]  [<b>accelerator</b> ]   <b>function</b>
           <b>label</b>  [<b>mnemonic</b>]  [<b>accelerator</b> ]   <b>function</b>
           ...
           <b>label</b>  [<b>mnemonic</b>]  [<b>accelerator</b> ]   <b>function</b>
       <u>}</u>

       Each  line  in the <u>Menu</u> specification identifies the label for a menu item and the function to be done if
       the menu item is selected. Optionally a menu button mnemonic and a menu button keyboard  accelerator  may
       be  specified.  Mnemonics are functional only when the menu is posted and keyboard traversal applies. The
       <b>label</b> may be a string or a bitmap file. The label specification has the following syntax:

       <b>label</b> = <b>text</b> | <b>bitmap_file</b>
       <b>bitmap_file</b> = <u>@</u><b>file_name</b>
       <b>text</b> = <b>quoted_item</b> | <b>unquoted_item</b>

       The string encoding for labels must be compatible with the menu font that is used. Labels are greyed  out
       for  menu items that do the <b>f.nop</b> function or an invalid function or a function that doesn't apply in the
       current context. A <b>mnemonic</b> specification has the following syntax:

       <b>mnemonic</b> = <b>_</b> <b>character</b>

       The first matching <b>character</b> in the label is underlined.  If there is no matching <b>character</b> in the label,
       no mnemonic is registered with the window manager for that label. Although  the  <b>character</b>  must  exactly
       match  a character in the label, the mnemonic does not execute if any modifier (such as Shift) is pressed
       with the character key. The <b>accelerator</b> specification is a key event specification with the  same  syntax
       as is used for key bindings to window manager functions.

</pre><h4><b>INCLUDING</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       You may include other files into your mwmrc file by using the <u>include</u> construct. For example,

       INCLUDE
       {
           /usr/local/shared/mwm.menus
           /home/kmt/personal/my.bindings
       }

       causes  the  files  named to be read in and interpreted in order as an additional part of the mwmrc file.
       <u>Include</u> is a top-level construct. It cannot be nested inside another construct.

</pre><h4><b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Errors  that  occur  during  the  processing  of  the  resource  description  file   are   recorded   in:
       <b>$HOME/.mwm/errorlog</b>.  Be  sure  to  check  this file if the appearance or behavior of <b>mwm</b> is not what you
       expect.
