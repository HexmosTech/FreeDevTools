       aibs — ASUSTeK AI Booster ACPI ATK0110 voltage, temperature and fan sensor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your kernel configuration file:

             <b>device</b> <b>aibs</b>

       Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in <u><a href="../man5/loader.conf.5.html">loader.conf</a></u>(5):

             aibs_load="YES"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>aibs</b>  driver  provides  support  for  the voltage, temperature and fan sensors available through the
       ATK0110 ASOC ACPI device on ASUSTeK motherboards.  The number of sensors of each type,  as  well  as  the
       description of each sensor, varies according to the motherboard.

       The driver supports an arbitrary set of sensors, provides descriptions regarding what each sensor is used
       for,  and  reports the current values as well as the supposed range specifications of each sensor's input
       as defined by the motherboard manufacturer through ACPI.

       The range specifications are as follows:

       <b>•</b>   Voltage sensors have a lower and an upper range specification.

       <b>•</b>   Temperature sensors have two upper specifications.

       <b>•</b>   Fan sensors may either have only the lower specification, or, depending on the DSDT,  one  lower  and
           one upper specification.

       Sensor  readings and the range specifications are made available through the <u><a href="../man3/sysctl.3.html">sysctl</a></u>(3) interface, and can
       be monitored with <u><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></u>(8).  For example, on an ASUS V3-P5G965 barebone:

             &gt; sysctl dev.aibs.0.{volt,temp,fan}
             dev.aibs.0.volt.0: 1192 850 1600
             dev.aibs.0.volt.1: 3312 2970 3630
             dev.aibs.0.volt.2: 5017 4500 5500
             dev.aibs.0.volt.3: 12302 10200 13800
             dev.aibs.0.temp.0: 28.0C 80.0C 95.0C
             dev.aibs.0.temp.1: 55.0C 60.0C 95.0C
             dev.aibs.0.fan.0: 878 600 7200
             dev.aibs.0.fan.1: 0 700 7200

             &gt; sysctl -d dev.aibs.0.{volt,temp,fan}
             dev.aibs.0.volt:
             dev.aibs.0.volt.0: Vcore Voltage
             dev.aibs.0.volt.1:  +3.3 Voltage
             dev.aibs.0.volt.2:  +5 Voltage
             dev.aibs.0.volt.3:  +12 Voltage
             dev.aibs.0.temp:
             dev.aibs.0.temp.0: CPU Temperature
             dev.aibs.0.temp.1: MB Temperature
             dev.aibs.0.fan:
             dev.aibs.0.fan.0: CPU FAN Speed
             dev.aibs.0.fan.1: CHASSIS FAN Speed

       Generally, sensors provided by the <b>aibs</b> driver  may  also  be  supported  by  certain  other  drivers  or
       utilities  that  access  the  ISA  / LPC or I2C / SMBus devices directly.  The precise collection of <b>aibs</b>
       sensors is comprised of the sensors specifically  utilised  in  the  motherboard  design,  which  may  be
       supported through a combination of one or more physical hardware monitoring chips.

       The  <b>aibs</b>  driver,  however,  provides  the  following  advantages  when  compared to the native hardware
       monitoring drivers or other utilities:

       <b>•</b>   Sensor values from <b>aibs</b> are expected to be more reliable.   For  example,  voltage  sensors  in  many
           hardware monitoring chips can only sense voltage from 0 to 2 or 4 volts, and the excessive voltage is
           removed  by  the  resistors,  which  may vary with the motherboard and with the voltage that is being
           sensed.  In <b>aibs</b>, the required resistor factors are provided by the motherboard manufacturer  through
           ACPI;  in  the  native  drivers,  the  resistor factors are encoded into the driver based on the chip
           manufacturer's recommendations.  In essence, sensor values from <b>aibs</b> are very likely to be  identical
           to the readings from the Hardware Monitor screen in the BIOS.

       <b>•</b>   Sensor descriptions from <b>aibs</b> are more likely to match the markings on the motherboard.

       <b>•</b>   Sensor  range  specifications  are  supported  by <b>aibs</b>.  The range specification is reported for each
           individual sensor as suggested by the motherboard manufacturer.  For example, the threshold  for  the
           CPU  temperature  sensor  is  likely to be significantly higher than that for the chassis temperature
           sensor.

       <b>•</b>   Support for newer chips in <b>aibs</b>.  Newer chips may miss a  native  driver,  but  should  be  supported
           through <b>aibs</b> regardless.
