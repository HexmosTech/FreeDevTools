       active - List of newsgroups carried by the server

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The file <u>pathdb</u>/active lists the newsgroups carried by INN.  This file is generally maintained using
       <a href="../man8/ctlinnd.8.html">ctlinnd</a>(8) to create and remove groups, or by letting <a href="../man8/controlchan.8.html">controlchan</a>(8) do so on the basis of received
       control messages; this file is then updated and a backup stored in <u>pathdb</u>/active.old.  Note that the
       <a href="../man5/newsgroups.5.html">newsgroups</a>(5) file normally contains the descriptions of the newsgroups carried by the news server.

       The <u>active</u> file should not be edited directly without throttling <b>innd</b>, and must be reloaded using <b>ctlinnd</b>
       before <b>innd</b> is unthrottled.  Editing it directly even with those precautions may make it inconsistent
       with the overview database and won't update <u>active.times</u>, so <b>ctlinnd</b> should be used to make modifications
       whenever possible.

       Each newsgroup should be listed only once.  Each line specifies one group.  The order of groups does not
       matter.  Within each newsgroup, received articles for that group are assigned monotonically increasing
       numbers as unique names.  If an article is posted to newsgroups not mentioned in this file, those
       newsgroups are ignored.

       If none of the newsgroups listed in the Newsgroups header field body of an article are present in this
       file, the article is either rejected (if <u>wanttrash</u> is false in <u>inn.conf</u>), or is filed into the newsgroup
       "junk" and, when "Aj" is not set in the <u>newsfeeds</u> feed pattern, only propagated to sites that receive the
       "junk" newsgroup (if <u>wanttrash</u> is true).

       Each line of this file consists of four fields separated by a space:

           &lt;name&gt; &lt;high&gt; &lt;low&gt; &lt;status&gt;

       The first field is the name of the newsgroup.  The newsgroup "junk" is special, as mentioned above.  The
       newsgroup "control" and any newsgroups beginning with "control." are also special; control messages are
       filed into a control.* newsgroup named after the type of control message if that group exists, and
       otherwise are filed into the newsgroup "control" (without regard to what newsgroups are listed in the
       Newsgroups header field body).  If <u>mergetogroups</u> is set to true in <u>inn.conf</u>, newsgroups that begin with
       "to." are also treated specially; see <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8).

       The second field is the highest article number that has been used in that newsgroup.  The third field is
       the lowest article number in the group; this number is not guaranteed to be accurate, and should only be
       taken to be a hint.  It is normally updated nightly as part of the expire process; see <a href="../man8/news.daily.8.html">news.daily</a>(8) and
       look for "lowmark" or "renumber" for more details.  Note that because of article cancellations, there may
       be gaps in the numbering sequence.  If the lowest article number is greater than the highest article
       number, then there are no articles in the newsgroup.  In order to make it possible to update an entry in-
       place without rewriting the entire file, the second and third fields are padded out with leading zeros to
       make them a fixed width.

       The fourth field contains one of the following status:

           y         Local postings and articles from peers are allowed.
           m         The group is moderated and all postings must be approved.
           n         No local postings are allowed, only articles from peers.
           j         Articles from peers are filed in the junk group instead.
           x         No local postings, and articles from peers are ignored.
           =foo.bar  Articles are filed in the group foo.bar instead.

       If a newsgroup has the "j" status, no articles will be filed in that newsgroup.  Local postings are not
       accepted; if an article for that newsgroup is received from a remote site, and if it is not crossposted
       to some other valid group, it will be filed into the "junk" newsgroup instead.  This is different than
       simply not listing the group, since the article will still be accepted and can be propagated to other
       sites, and the "junk" group can be made available to readers if wished.

       If the &lt;status&gt; field begins with an equal sign, the newsgroup is an alias.  Articles cannot be posted to
       that newsgroup, but they can be received from other sites.  Any articles received from peers for that
       newsgroup are treated as if they were actually posted to the group named after the equal sign.  Note that
       the Newsgroups header field of the articles is not modified.  (Alias groups are typically used during a
       transition and are typically created manually with <a href="../man8/ctlinnd.8.html">ctlinnd</a>(8).)  An alias should not point to another
       alias.

       Note that <u>readers.conf</u> can be configured so that local posts to newsgroups with status "j", "n" or "x"
       are accepted.

</pre><h4><b>MINIMAL</b> <b>ACTIVE</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       For <b>innd</b> to be able to start, the three groups "control", "control.cancel" and "junk" need to be in the
       <u>active</u> file.  Besides, if <u>mergetogroups</u> is set to true in <u>inn.conf</u>, the newsgroup "to" also needs to
       exist.

       The minimal <u>active</u> file shipped with INN is:

           control 0000000000 0000000001 n
           control.cancel 0000000000 0000000001 n
           control.checkgroups 0000000000 0000000001 n
           control.newgroup 0000000000 0000000001 n
           control.rmgroup 0000000000 0000000001 n
           junk 0000000000 0000000001 n

       (Note that the second and the third field may differ if the news server has already been in use.)

       There are more control.* pseudogroups here than needed by <b>innd</b> to start; the corresponding control
       messages will be filed into them.  The "n" status is so that users cannot post directly to these groups
       (control messages should only be posted to the groups that they affect).  If you do not want these groups
       to be visible to clients, do not delete them but simply hide them in <a href="../man5/readers.conf.5.html">readers.conf</a>(5).

       To create additional groups after the server is running, you can use "ctlinnd newgroup".  You can also
       synchronize your newsgroup list to that of another server by using <a href="../man8/actsync.8.html">actsync</a>(8) or get the <u>active</u> file of
       another NNTP server with <a href="../man1/getlist.1.html">getlist</a>(1).  And do not forget to update your <u>newsgroups</u> file, which can be
       automatically done thanks to <b>docheckgroups</b> called with the <b>-u</b> flag.
