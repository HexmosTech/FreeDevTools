</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       machine-id - Local machine ID configuration file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> file contains the unique machine ID of the local system that is set during
       installation or boot. The machine ID is a single newline-terminated, hexadecimal, 32-character, lowercase
       ID. When decoded from hexadecimal, this corresponds to a 16-byte/128-bit value. This ID may not be all
       zeros.

       The machine ID is usually generated from a random source during system installation or first boot and
       stays constant for all subsequent boots. Optionally, for stateless systems, it is generated during
       runtime during early boot if necessary.

       The machine ID may be set, for example when network booting, with the <u>systemd.machine_id=</u> kernel command
       line parameter or by passing the option <b>--machine-id=</b> to systemd. An ID specified in this manner has
       higher priority and will be used instead of the ID stored in /etc/machine-id.

       The machine ID does not change based on local or network configuration or when hardware is replaced. Due
       to this and its greater length, it is a more useful replacement for the <b><a href="../man3/gethostid.3.html">gethostid</a></b>(3) call that POSIX
       specifies.

       This machine ID adheres to the same format and logic as the D-Bus machine ID.

       This ID uniquely identifies the host. It should be considered "confidential", and must not be exposed in
       untrusted environments, in particular on the network. If a stable unique identifier that is tied to the
       machine is needed for some application, the machine ID or any part of it must not be used directly.
       Instead the machine ID should be hashed with a cryptographic, keyed hash function, using a fixed,
       application-specific key. That way the ID will be properly unique, and derived in a constant way from the
       machine ID but there will be no way to retrieve the original machine ID from the application-specific
       one. The <b><a href="../man3/sd_id128_get_machine_app_specific.3.html">sd_id128_get_machine_app_specific</a></b>(3) API provides an implementation of such an algorithm.

</pre><h4><b>INITIALIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       Each machine should have a non-empty ID in normal operation. The ID of each machine should be unique. To
       achieve those objectives, <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> can be initialized in a few different ways.

       For normal operating system installations, where a custom image is created for a specific machine,
       <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> should be populated during installation.

       <b><a href="../man1/systemd-machine-id-setup.1.html">systemd-machine-id-setup</a></b>(1) may be used by installer tools to initialize the machine ID at install time,
       but <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> may also be written using any other means.

       For operating system images which are created once and used on multiple machines, for example for
       containers or in the cloud, <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> should be either missing or an empty file in the generic file
       system image (the difference between the two options is described under "First Boot Semantics" below). An
       ID will be generated during boot and saved to this file if possible. Having an empty file in place is
       recommended because it allows a temporary file to be bind-mounted over the real file, in case the image
       is used read-only and when <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a> is mounted read-only in the early boot. Also see <b>Safely</b> <b>Building</b>
       <b>Images</b>[1].

       <b><a href="../man1/systemd-firstboot.1.html">systemd-firstboot</a></b>(1) may be used to initialize <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> on mounted (but not booted) system images.

       When a machine is booted with <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) the ID of the machine will be established. If
       <u>systemd.machine_id=</u> or <b>--machine-id=</b> options (see first section) are specified, this value will be used.
       Otherwise, the value in <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> will be used. If this file is empty or missing, systemd will
       attempt to use the D-Bus machine ID from <a href="file:/var/lib/dbus/machine-id">/var/lib/dbus/machine-id</a>, the value of the kernel command line
       option <u>container_uuid</u>, the KVM DMI product_uuid or the devicetree vm,uuid (on KVM systems), the Xen
       hypervisor uuid, and finally a randomly generated UUID.  <u>systemd.machine_id=firmware</u> can be set to
       generate the machine ID from the firmware.

       After the machine ID is established, <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) will attempt to save it to /etc/machine-id. If this
       fails, it will attempt to bind-mount a temporary file over /etc/machine-id. It is an error if the file
       system is read-only and does not contain a (possibly empty) <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> file.

       <b><a href="../man8/systemd-machine-id-commit.service.8.html">systemd-machine-id-commit.service</a></b>(8) will attempt to write the machine ID to the file system if
       <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> or <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> are read-only during early boot but become writable later on.

</pre><h4><b>FIRST</b> <b>BOOT</b> <b>SEMANTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> is used to decide whether a boot is the first one. The rules are as follows:

        1. The kernel command argument <u>systemd.condition_first_boot=</u> may be used to override the autodetection
           logic, see <b><a href="../man7/kernel-command-line.7.html">kernel-command-line</a></b>(7).

        2. Otherwise, if <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> does not exist, this is a first boot. During early boot, <b>systemd</b> will
           write "uninitialized\n" to this file and overmount a temporary file which contains the actual machine
           ID. Later (after first-boot-complete.target has been reached), the real machine ID will be written to
           disk.

        3. If <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> contains the string "uninitialized", a boot is also considered the first boot. The
           same mechanism as above applies.

        4. If <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> exists and is empty, a boot is <u>not</u> considered the first boot.  <b>systemd</b> will still
           bind-mount a file containing the actual machine-id over it and later try to commit it to disk (if
           <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> is writable).

        5. If <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> already contains a valid machine-id, this is not a first boot.

       If according to the above rules a first boot is detected, units with <u>ConditionFirstBoot=yes</u> will be run
       and <b>systemd</b> will perform additional initialization steps, in particular presetting units.

</pre><h4><b>RELATION</b> <b>TO</b> <b>OSF</b> <b>UUIDS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that the machine ID historically is not an OSF UUID as defined by <b>RFC</b> <b>4122</b>[2], nor a Microsoft GUID;
       however, starting with systemd v30, newly generated machine IDs do qualify as Variant 1 Version 4 UUIDs,
       as per RFC 4122.

       In order to maintain compatibility with existing installations, an application requiring a strictly RFC
       4122 compliant UUID should decode the machine ID, and then (non-reversibly) apply the following
       operations to turn it into a valid RFC 4122 Variant 1 Version 4 UUID. With "id" being an unsigned
       character array:

           /* Set UUID version to 4 --- truly random generation */
           id[6] = (id[6] &amp; 0x0F) | 0x40;
           /* Set the UUID variant to DCE */
           id[8] = (id[8] &amp; 0x3F) | 0x80;

       (This code is inspired by "generate_random_uuid()" of drivers/char/random.c from the Linux kernel
       sources.)

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The simple configuration file format of <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> originates in the <a href="file:/var/lib/dbus/machine-id">/var/lib/dbus/machine-id</a> file
       introduced by D-Bus. In fact, this latter file might be a symlink to /etc/machine-id.
