</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       storage.conf - Syntax of Container Storage configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  STORAGE  configuration file specifies all of the available container storage options for tools using
       shared container storage, but in a TOML format that can be more easily modified and versioned.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The [TOML format][toml] is used as the encoding of the configuration file.   Every  option  and  subtable
       listed  here  is nested under a global "storage" table.  No bare options are used. The format of TOML can
       be simplified to:

       [table]
       option = value

       [table.subtable1]
       option = value

       [table.subtable2]
       option = value

</pre><h4><b>STORAGE</b> <b>TABLE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>storage</b> table supports the following options:

       <b>driver</b>=""
         Copy On Write (COW) container storage driver. Valid drivers are "overlay", "vfs", "aufs", "btrfs",  and
       "zfs".  Some  drivers (for example, "zfs", "btrfs", and "aufs") may not work if your kernel lacks support
       for the filesystem.  This field is required to guarantee proper operation.  Valid  rootless  drivers  are
       "btrfs",  "overlay", and "vfs".  Rootless users default to the driver defined in the system configuration
       when possible.  When the system configuration uses an unsupported rootless driver, rootless users default
       to "overlay" if available, otherwise "vfs".

       <b>graphroot</b>=""
         container storage graph dir (default: "/var/lib/containers/storage") Default  directory  to  store  all
       writable content created by container storage programs.  The rootless graphroot path supports environment
       variable  substitutions  (ie.  <b>$HOME/containers/storage</b>).   When  changing  the  graphroot location on an
       SELINUX system, ensure the labeling matches the default locations labels with the following commands:

       # semanage fcontext -a -e /var/lib/containers/storage /NEWSTORAGEPATH
       # restorecon -R -v /NEWSTORAGEPATH

       In rootless mode you would set

       # semanage fcontext -a -e $HOME/.local/share/containers NEWSTORAGEPATH
       $ restorecon -R -v /NEWSTORAGEPATH

       <b>rootless_storage_path</b>="$HOME/.local/share/containers/storage"
         Storage  path  for  rootless  users.  By  default  the  graphroot  for  rootless  users   is   set   to
       <b>$XDG_DATA_HOME/containers/storage</b>,         if        XDG_DATA_HOME        is        set.        Otherwise
       <b>$HOME/.local/share/containers/storage</b> is used. This field can be used if administrators  need  to  change
       the storage location for all users. The rootless storage path supports environment variable substitutions
       (ie. <b>$HOME/containers/storage</b>)

       A  common  use case for this field is to provide a local storage directory when user home directories are
       NFS-mounted (podman does not support container storage over NFS).

       <b>imagestore</b>=""
        The image storage path (the default is assumed to be the same as <b>graphroot</b>).  Path  of  the  imagestore,
       which is different from <b>graphroot</b>. By default, images in the storage library are stored in the <b>graphroot</b>.
       If  <b>imagestore</b>  is  provided,  newly  pulled  images will be stored in the <b>imagestore</b> location. All other
       storage continues to be stored in the <b>graphroot</b>. When using the <b>overlay</b> driver, images previously  stored
       in   the   <b>graphroot</b>   remain  accessible.  Internally,  the  storage  library  mounts  <b>graphroot</b>  as  an
       <b>additionalImageStore</b> to allow this behavior.

       A common use case for the  <b>imagestore</b>  field  is  users  who  need  to  split  filesystems  in  different
       partitions.  The  <b>imagestore</b> partition stores images and the <b>graphroot</b> partition stores container content
       created from the images.

       Imagestore, if set, must be different from <b>graphroot</b>.

       <b>runroot</b>=""
         container storage run dir (default: "/run/containers/storage") Default directory to store all temporary
       writable content created by container storage programs. The rootless runroot  path  supports  environment
       variable substitutions (ie. <b>$HOME/containers/storage</b>)

       <b>driver_priority</b>=[]
         Priority  list  for  the  storage  drivers  that will be tested one after the other to pick the storage
       driver if it is not defined. The first storage driver in this list that can be used, will  be  picked  as
       the  new  one and all subsequent ones will not be tried. If all drivers in this list are not viable, then
       <b>all</b> known drivers will be tried and the first working one will be picked.  By default, the storage driver
       is set via the <b>driver</b> option. If it is not defined, then the best driver will be picked according to  the
       current  platform.  This  option  allows you to override this internal priority list with a custom one to
       prefer certain drivers.  Setting this option only has an  effect  if  the  local  storage  has  not  been
       initialized yet and the driver name is not set.

       <b>transient_store</b> = "false"|"true"

       Transient  store  mode  makes  all container metadata be saved in temporary storage (i.e. runroot above).
       This is faster, but doesn't persist across reboots.  Additional garbage collection must also be performed
       at boot-time, so this option should remain disabled in most configurations. (default: false)

   <b>STORAGE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       The <b>storage.options</b> table supports the following options:

       <b>additionalimagestores</b>=[]
         Paths to additional container image stores. Usually these are read/only and stored  on  remote  network
       shares.

       <b>root-auto-userns-user</b>=""
         Root-auto-userns-user  is  a  user  name which can be used to look up one or more UID/GID ranges in the
       <a href="file:/etc/subuid">/etc/subuid</a> and <a href="file:/etc/subgid">/etc/subgid</a> file.  These ranges will be partitioned to containers  configured  to  create
       automatically a user namespace.  Containers configured to automatically create a user namespace can still
       overlap  with  containers  having  an  explicit  mapping  set.   This  setting is ignored when running as
       rootless.

       <b>auto-userns-min-size</b>=1024
         Auto-userns-min-size is the minimum size for a user namespace created automatically.

       <b>auto-userns-max-size</b>=65536
         Auto-userns-max-size is the maximum size for a user namespace created automatically.

       <b>disable-volatile</b>=true
         If disable-volatile is set, then the "volatile" mount optimization is disabled for all the containers.

   <b>STORAGE</b> <b>PULL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       The <b>storage.options.pull_options</b> table supports the following keys:

       <b>enable_partial_images="true"|"false"</b>
         Enable the "zstd:chunked" feature, which allows partial pulls, reusing
         content that already exists on the system. This is disabled by default,
         and must be explicitly enabled to be used. For more on zstd:chunked, see

       ⟨https://github.com/containers/storage/blob/main/docs/containers-storage-zstd-chunked.md⟩.
         This is a "string bool": "false"|"true" (cannot be native TOML boolean)

       <b>use_hard_links="false"|"true"</b>
         Tells containers/storage to use hard links rather then create new files in
         the image, if an identical file already existed in storage.
         This is a "string bool": "false"|"true" (cannot be native TOML boolean)

       <b>ostree_repos=""</b>
         Path to an ostree repository that might have
         previously pulled content which can be used when attempting to avoid
         pulling content from the container registry.

       <b>convert_images="false"|"true"</b>
         If set to "true", containers/storage will convert images that are
         not already in zstd:chunked format to that format before processing
         in order to take advantage of local deduplication and hard linking.
         It is an expensive operation so it is not enabled by default.
         This is a "string bool": "false"|"true" (cannot be native TOML boolean)

       <b>insecure_allow_unpredictable_image_contents="false"|"true"</b>
         This should <u>almost</u> <u>never</u> be set.
         It allows partial pulls of images without guaranteeing that "partial
         pulls" and non-partial pulls both result in consistent image contents.
         This allows pulling estargz images and early versions of zstd:chunked images;
         otherwise, these layers always use the traditional non-partial pull path.

       This option should be enabled <u>extremely</u> rarely, only if <u>all</u> images that could
         EVER be conceivably pulled on this system are <u>guaranteed</u> (e.g. using a signature policy)
         to come from a build system trusted to never attack image integrity.

       If this consistency enforcement were disabled, malicious images could be built
         in a way designed to evade other audit mechanisms, so presence of most other audit
         mechanisms is not a replacement for the above-mentioned need for all images to come
         from a trusted build system.

       As a side effect, enabling this option will also make image IDs unpredictable
         (usually not equal to the traditional value matching the config digest).

       This is a "string bool": "false"|"true" (cannot be native TOML boolean)

   <b>STORAGE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>AUFS</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       The <b>storage.options.aufs</b> table supports the following options:

       <b>mountopt</b>=""
         Comma separated list of default options to be used to mount container images.  Suggested value "nodev".
       Mount options are documented in the <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a>(8) man page.

   <b>STORAGE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>BTRFS</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       The <b>storage.options.btrfs</b> table supports the following options:

       <b>min_space</b>=""
         Specifies the min space in a btrfs volume.

       <b>size</b>=""
         Maximum size of a container image.   This flag can be used to  set  quota  on  the  size  of  container
       images. (format: [], where unit = b (bytes), k (kilobytes), m (megabytes), or g (gigabytes))

   <b>STORAGE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>OVERLAY</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       The <b>storage.options.overlay</b> table supports the following options:

       <b>ignore_chown_errors</b> = "false"
         ignore_chown_errors  can be set to allow a non privileged user running with a  single UID within a user
       namespace to run containers. The user can pull and use any image even those  with  multiple  uids.   Note
       multiple  UIDs  will  be  squashed  down  to the default uid in the container.  These images will have no
       separation between the users in the container. (default: "false")
         This is a "string bool": "false"|"true" (cannot be native TOML boolean)

       <b>inodes</b>=""
         Maximum inodes in a read/write layer.   This flag can be used to set a quota on  the  inodes  allocated
       for a read/write layer of a container.

       <b>force_mask</b> = "0000|shared|private"
         ForceMask  specifies  the  permissions  mask  that  is  used  for new files and directories. The values
       "shared" and "private" are accepted.  (default: ""). Octal permission masks are also accepted.

              • ``: Not set All files/directories, get set with the permissions identified within the image.

              • <b>private</b>: it is equivalent to 0700.  All files/directories get set with  0700  permissions.   The
                owner  has  rwx  access  to  the files. No other users on the system can access the files.  This
                setting could be used with networked based home directories.

              • <b>shared</b>: it is equivalent to 0755.  The owner has rwx access to the files and everyone  else  can
                read,  access and execute them. This setting is useful for sharing containers storage with other
                users.  For instance, a storage owned by root could be shared to rootless users as an additional
                store.  NOTE:  All files within the image are made readable and executable by any  user  on  the
                system. Even <a href="file:/etc/shadow">/etc/shadow</a> within your image is now readable by any user.

       <b>OCTAL</b>: Users can experiment with other OCTAL Permissions.

       Note:  The  force_mask Flag is an experimental feature, it could change in the future.  When "force_mask"
       is set the original permission mask is  stored  in  the  "user.containers.override_stat"  xattr  and  the
       "mount_program"  option  must  be  specified.  Mount  programs like "/usr/bin/fuse-overlayfs" present the
       extended attribute permissions to processes within containers rather than the "force_mask"  permissions.

       <b>mount_program</b>=""
         Specifies the path to a custom program to use instead of using kernel defaults for  mounting  the  file
       system.  In rootless mode, without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, many kernels prevent mounting of overlay
       file systems, requiring you to specify a mount_program. The mount_program  option  is  also  required  on
       systems where the underlying storage is btrfs, aufs, zfs, overlay, or ecryptfs based file systems.
         mount_program = "/usr/bin/fuse-overlayfs"

       <b>mountopt</b>=""
         Comma separated list of default options to be used to mount container images.  Suggested value "nodev".
       Mount options are documented in the <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a>(8) man page.

       <b>skip_mount_home="false"</b>
         Tell storage drivers to not create a PRIVATE bind mount on their home directory.
         This is a "string bool": "false"|"true" (cannot be native TOML boolean)

       <b>size</b>=""
         Maximum  size  of  a read/write layer.   This flag can be used to set quota on the size of a read/write
       layer of a container. (format:  [],  where  unit  =  b  (bytes),  k  (kilobytes),  m  (megabytes),  or  g
       (gigabytes))

       <b>use_composefs</b> = "false"
           Use  ComposeFS to mount the data layers image.  ComposeFS support is experimental and not recommended
       for production use.
           This is a "string bool": "false"|"true" (cannot be native TOML boolean)

   <b>STORAGE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VFS</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       The <b>storage.options.vfs</b> table supports the following options:

       <b>ignore_chown_errors</b> = "false"
         ignore_chown_errors can be set to allow a non privileged user running with a  single UID within a  user
       namespace  to  run  containers.  The user can pull and use any image even those with multiple uids.  Note
       multiple UIDs will be squashed down to the default uid in the  container.   These  images  will  have  no
       separation between the users in the container.
         This is a "string bool": "false"|"true" (cannot be native TOML boolean)

   <b>STORAGE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>ZFS</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       The <b>storage.options.zfs</b> table supports the following options:

       <b>fsname</b>=""
         File System name for the zfs driver

       <b>mountopt</b>=""
         Comma separated list of default options to be used to mount container images.  Suggested value "nodev".
       Mount options are documented in the <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a>(8) man page.

       <b>size</b>=""
         Maximum  size  of  a  container  image.    This  flag can be used to set quota on the size of container
       images. (format: [], where unit = b (bytes), k (kilobytes), m (megabytes), or g (gigabytes))

</pre><h4><b>SELINUX</b> <b>LABELING</b></h4><pre>
       When running on an SELinux system, if you move the containers storage graphroot directory, you must  make
       sure the labeling is correct.

       Tell  SELinux about the new containers storage by setting up an equivalence record. This tells SELinux to
       label content under the new path, as if it was stored under <b>/var/lib/containers/storage</b>.

       semanage fcontext -a -e /var/lib/containers NEWSTORAGEPATH
       restorecon -R -v NEWSTORAGEPATH

       In rootless mode, you would set

       semanage fcontext -a -e $HOME/.local/share/containers NEWSTORAGEPATH
       restorecon -R -v NEWSTORAGEPATH

       The semanage command above tells SELinux to  setup  the  default  labeling  of  <b>NEWSTORAGEPATH</b>  to  match
       <b>/var/lib/containers</b>.  The <b>restorecon</b> command tells SELinux to apply the labels to the actual content.

       Now all new content created in these directories will automatically be created with the correct label.

</pre><h4><b>QUOTAS</b></h4><pre>
       Container  storage  implements <b>XFS</b> <b>project</b> <b>quota</b> <b>controls</b> for overlay storage containers and volumes. The
       directory used to store the containers must be an <b>XFS</b> file system and be mounted with the <b>pquota</b> option.

       Example <a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a> entry:

       /dev/podman/podman-var <a href="file:/var">/var</a> xfs defaults,x-systemd.device-timeout=0,pquota 1 2

       Container storage generates project ids for each container and builtin volume, but these project ids need
       to be unique for the XFS file system.

       The xfs_quota tool can be used to assign a project id to the storage driver directory, e.g.:

       echo 100000:/var/lib/containers/storage/overlay &gt;&gt; /etc/projects
       echo 200000:/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes &gt;&gt; /etc/projects
       echo storage:100000 &gt;&gt; /etc/projid
       echo volumes:200000 &gt;&gt; /etc/projid
       xfs_quota -x -c 'project -s storage volumes' /&lt;xfs mount point&gt;

       In the example above, the storage directory project  id  will  be  used  as  a  "start  offset"  and  all
       containers  will  be assigned larger project ids (e.g. &gt;= 100000).  Then the volumes directory project id
       will be used as a "start offset" and all volumes will be assigned larger project ids  (e.g.  &gt;=  200000).
       This is a way to prevent xfs_quota management from conflicting with containers/storage.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Distributions   often  provide  a  <b>/usr/share/containers/storage.conf</b>  file  to  define  default  storage
       configuration. Administrators can override this file by creating <b>/etc/containers/storage.conf</b> to  specify
       their  own  configuration.  Likewise rootless users can create a storage.conf file to override the system
       storage.conf files. Files should be stored  in  the  <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/containers/storage.conf</b>  file.   If
       <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b> is not set then the file <b>$HOME/.config/containers/storage.conf</b> is used.

       Note: The storage.conf file overrides all other storage.conf files. Container engines run by users with a
       storage.conf file in their home directory do not use options in the system storage.conf files.

       /etc/projects - XFS persistent project root definition /etc/projid -  XFS project name mapping file
