</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       group.conf - configuration file for the pam_group module

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The pam_group PAM module does not authenticate the user, but instead it grants group memberships (in the
       credential setting phase of the authentication module) to the user. Such memberships are based on the
       service they are applying for.

       For this module to function correctly there must be a correctly formatted <a href="file:/etc/security/group.conf">/etc/security/group.conf</a> file
       present. White spaces are ignored and lines maybe extended with '\' (escaped newlines). Text following a
       '#' is ignored to the end of the line.

       The syntax of the lines is as follows:

       <u>services</u>;<u>ttys</u>;<u>users</u>;<u>times</u>;<u>groups</u>

       The first field, the <u>services</u> field, is a logic list of PAM service names that the rule applies to.

       The second field, the <u>tty</u> field, is a logic list of terminal names that this rule applies to.

       The third field, the <u>users</u> field, is a logic list of users, or a UNIX group, or a netgroup of users to
       whom this rule applies. Group names are preceded by a '%' symbol, while netgroup names are preceded by a
       '@' symbol.

       A logic list namely means individual tokens that are optionally prefixed with '!' (logical not) and
       separated with '&amp;' (logical and) and '|' (logical or).

       For these items the simple wildcard '*' may be used only once. With UNIX groups or netgroups no wildcards
       or logic operators are allowed.

       The <u>times</u> field is used to indicate "when" these groups are to be given to the user. The format here is a
       logic list of day/time-range entries. The days are specified by a sequence of two character entries,
       MoTuSa for example is Monday Tuesday and Saturday. Note that repeated days are unset MoMo = no day, and
       MoWk = all weekdays bar Monday. The two character combinations accepted are Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su Wk Wd
       Al, the last two being week-end days and all 7 days of the week respectively. As a final example, AlFr
       means all days except Friday.

       Each day/time-range can be prefixed with a '!' to indicate "anything but". The time-range part is two
       24-hour times HHMM, separated by a hyphen, indicating the start and finish time (if the finish time is
       smaller than the start time it is deemed to apply on the following day).

       The <u>groups</u> field is a comma or space separated list of groups that the user inherits membership of. These
       groups are added if the previous fields are satisfied by the user's request.

       For a rule to be active, ALL of service+ttys+users must be satisfied by the applying process.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       These are some example lines which might be specified in /etc/security/group.conf.

       Running 'xsh' on tty* (any ttyXXX device), the user 'us' is given access to the floppy (through
       membership of the floppy group)

           xsh;tty*&amp;!ttyp*;us;Al0000-2400;floppy

       Running 'xsh' on tty* (any ttyXXX device), the users 'sword', 'pike' and 'shield' are given access to
       games (through membership of the floppy group) after work hours.

           xsh; tty* ;sword|pike|shield;!Wk0900-1800;games, sound
           xsh; tty* ;*;Al0900-1800;floppy

       Any member of the group 'admin' running 'xsh' on tty*, is granted access (at any time) to the group
       'plugdev'

           xsh; tty* ;%admin;Al0000-2400;plugdev
