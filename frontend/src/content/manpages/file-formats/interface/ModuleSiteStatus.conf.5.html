</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ModuleSiteStatus.conf - Configuration file for the SvxLink server Site status module

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>svxlink</b>  is  a general purpose voice service system for ham radio use. This man-page describe the SvxLink
       server configuration for the SiteStatus module.

       The SiteStatus module is used to monitor auxiliary sensors that are triggered  by  either  a  GPIO  event
       (digital type sensors) or crossing a threshold outside the hysteresis (analog type sensors)

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  a  couple  of  configuration variables that are common to all modules.  The documentation for
       these can be found in the <b><a href="../man5/svxlink.conf.5.html">svxlink.conf</a></b>(5) manual page.

       Here is the description of all module specific configuration variables that the SvxLink SiteStatus module
       understands.

   <b>ModuleSiteStatus</b>
       <b>DIGITAL_GPIO_PATH</b>
              The absolute path to the digital gpio pins stopping  before  the  actual  pin  number.   Typically
              "/sys/class/gpio/gpio" for a raspberry pi, but may vary.

       <b>DIGITAL_SENSORS_COUNT</b>
              The  DIGITAL_SENSORS_COUNT  tells  the  module  how many digital type sensors are connected to the
              system that are to be monitored.

       <b>DIGITAL_#</b>
              The sensor number (increments from 0 by 1), value corresponds to  the  digital  gpio  pin  number.
              Example "DIGITAL_0=496". corresponds to sensor 0, which uses GPIO496 as the input pin to monitor.

       <b>DIGITAL_TYPE_#</b>
              The  DIGITAL_TYPE_# number (increments from 0 by 1), value corresponds to the type of sensor being
              monitored. Currently defined valid entries are: # DOOR_ACTIVE_HIGH -  Announces  a  door  is  open
              (open = true, closed = false) # DOOR_ACTIVE_LOW - Announces a door is open (open = false, closed =
              true)  #  FUEL_ACTIVE_HIGH  -  Announces  a  low fuel sensor is activated (active signal = true) #
              FUEL_ACTIVE_LOW - Announces a low fuel sensor is activated (active signal = false) # WATER  -  Not
              implemented yet # FIRE - Not implemented yet # SOLAR_ACTIVE_HIGH - Announces a Solar Charger state
              (active  signal  =  true)  #  SOLAR_ACTIVE_LOW  - Announces a Solar Charger state (active signal =
              false) # BATTERY - not implemented yet as an example:  DIGITAL_TYPE_0=DOOR_ACTIVE_HIGH  means  the
              sensor  that  is  attached  to  the  pin defined by DIGITAL_0 is a door sensor that when the value
              toggle from logic low to logic high indicates the door has been opened.

       <b>ANALOG_SENSORS_COUNT</b>
              The ANALOG_SENSORS_COUNT tells the module how many analog type sensors are connected to the system
              that are to be monitored.

       <b>ANALOG_GPIO_PATH</b>
              The absolute path to the analog sensor pins stopping before the actual pin number. The  functional
              tcl  file  may  need manipulated if the following structure does not reflect the final location of
              the raw data values in the system.  /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0/in_voltage&lt;number 0-N&gt;_raw

       <b>ANALOG_#</b>
              The sensor number (increments from 0 by 1),  value  corresponds  to  the  analog  channel  number.
              Example "ANALOG_0=0". corresponds to sensor channel 0

       <b>ANALOG_TYPE_#</b>
              The  ANALOG_TYPE_#  number (increments from 0 by 1), value corresponds to the type of sensor being
              monitored. Currently defined valid entries are: TEMPERATURE - Placeholder only, user to  configure
              based  on  scaling factors BATTERY_VOLTAGE  - Placeholder only, user to configure based on scaling
              factors as an example: # ANALOG_TYPE_0=TEMPERATURE

       <b>ANALOG_HYSTERISIS_#</b>
              The amount of signal "noise" that should be tolerated before an alarm is triggered.  For  example,
              during  development,  an  open analog pin had noise of +/- 35 counts from the mean value.  Setting
              the ANALOG_HYSTERISIS_#=40 would suppress the alarms from being triggered  every  second  for  in-
              range/out-of-range....   It  is  best  to  understand  the expected behavior of the circuit in the
              environment before locking down this value or the hysteresis may be too low  or  to  high  causing
              false alarms or missed alarms.

       <b>FILES</b>

       <u>/etc/svxlink/svxlink.conf</u> (or deprecated <u>/etc/svxlink.conf</u>)
              The system wide configuration file.

       <u><a href="file:~/.svxlink/svxlink.conf">~/.svxlink/svxlink.conf</a></u>
              Per user configuration file.

       <u>/etc/svxlink/svxlink.d/ModuleSiteStatus.conf</u>
              Global modularized configuration file. Depends on the CFG_DIR configuration variable setting.

       <u><a href="file:~/.svxlink/svxlink.d/ModuleSiteStatus.conf">~/.svxlink/svxlink.d/ModuleSiteStatus.conf</a></u>
              Per user modularized configuration file. Depends on the CFG_DIR configuration variable setting.
