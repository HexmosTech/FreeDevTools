</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       slapo-memberof - Reverse Group Membership overlay to slapd

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/ldap/slapd.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>memberof</b> overlay to <b><a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd</a></b>(8) allows automatic reverse group membership maintenance.  Any time a group
       entry  is  modified,  its members are modified as appropriate in order to keep a DN-valued "is member of"
       attribute updated with the DN of the group.

       Note that the <b>dynlist</b> overlay can also provide this functionality and may be suitable for less  demanding
       environments.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  config  directives that are specific to the <b>memberof</b> overlay must be prefixed by <b>memberof-</b>, to avoid
       potential conflicts with directives specific to the underlying database or to other stacked overlays.

       <b>overlay</b> <b>memberof</b>
              This directive adds the memberof overlay to the current database; see <b><a href="../man5/slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf</a></b>(5) for details.

       The following <b>slapd.conf</b> configuration options are defined for the memberof overlay.

       <b>memberof-group-oc</b> <u>&lt;group-oc&gt;</u>
              The value <u>&lt;group-oc&gt;</u> is the name of the objectClass that triggers  the  reverse  group  membership
              update.  It defaults to <u>groupOfNames</u>.

       <b>memberof-member-ad</b> <u>&lt;member-ad&gt;</u>
              The  value  <u>&lt;member-ad&gt;</u> is the name of the attribute that contains the names of the members in the
              group objects; it must be DN-valued.  It defaults to <u>member</u>.

       <b>memberof-memberof-ad</b> <u>&lt;memberof-ad&gt;</u>
              The value <u>&lt;memberof-ad&gt;</u> is the name of the attribute that contains the  names  of  the  groups  an
              entry  is member of; it must be DN-valued.  Its contents are automatically updated by the overlay.
              It defaults to <u>memberOf</u>.

       <b>memberof-dn</b> <u>&lt;dn&gt;</u>
              The value <u>&lt;dn&gt;</u> contains the DN that is used as <u>modifiersName</u> for internal modifications  performed
              to update the reverse group membership.  It defaults to the <u>rootdn</u> of the underlying database.

       <b>memberof-dangling</b> <b>{</b><u>ignore</u><b>,</b> <u>drop</u><b>,</b> <u>error</u><b>}</b>
              This  option  determines  the  behavior  of the overlay when, during a modification, it encounters
              dangling references.  The default is <u>ignore</u>, which may leave dangling references.   Other  options
              are  <u>drop</u>, which discards those modifications that would result in dangling references, and <u>error</u>,
              which causes modifications that would result in dangling references to fail.

       <b>memberof-dangling-error</b> <u>&lt;error-code&gt;</u>
              If <b>memberof-dangling</b> is set to <u>error</u>, this configuration parameter  can  be  used  to  modify  the
              response  code  returned  in  case of violation.  It defaults to "constraint violation", but other
              implementations are known to return "no such object" instead.

       <b>memberof-refint</b> <b>{</b><u>true</u><b>|</b><u>FALSE</u><b>}</b>
              This option determines whether the overlay will try to preserve referential integrity or not.   If
              set  to  <u>TRUE</u>,  when  an  entry containing values of the "is member of" attribute is modified, the
              corresponding groups are modified as well.

       <b>memberof-addcheck</b> <b>{</b><u>true</u><b>|</b><u>FALSE</u><b>}</b>
              This option determines whether the overlay will check newly added entries for  membership  in  any
              existing  groups. This check is useful if populated groups are created in the directory before the
              entries they reference. The situation often occurs during replication, which may replicate entries
              in random order.  If set to <u>TRUE</u>, every Add operation will search for groups referencing the added
              entry and populate its memberof attribute with the group DNs. Note that <b>memberof-dangling</b> must  be
              left on its default setting of <u>ignore</u> for this option to work.

       The  memberof overlay may be used with any backend that provides full read-write functionality, but it is
       mainly intended for use with local storage backends. The maintenance operations it performs are  internal
       to  the  server  on  which the overlay is configured and are never replicated. Consumer servers should be
       configured with their own instances of the memberOf overlay if it is desired to maintain  these  memberOf
       attributes  on  the  consumers.  Consumers must also be configured to exclude the <u>memberof</u> attribute from
       replication.  (See the <b>exattrs</b> option in the consumer configuration.)

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/ldap/slapd.conf
              default slapd configuration file

</pre><h4><b>BACKWARD</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The memberof overlay has been reworked with the 2.5 release to use a consistent namespace as  with  other
       overlays.  As  a  side-effect  the following cn=config parameters are deprecated and will be removed in a
       future release: <b>olcMemberOf</b> is replaced with olcMemberOfConfig

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>

The  <b><a href="../man5/slapo-memberof.5.html">slapo-memberof</a></b>(5)  overlay  supports
       dynamic configuration via <b>back-config</b>.
