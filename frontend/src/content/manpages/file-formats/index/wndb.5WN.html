</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       index.noun, data.noun, index.verb, data.verb, index.adj, data.adj, index.adv, data.adv - WordNet database
       files

       noun.exc, verb.exc. adj.exc adv.exc - morphology exception lists

       sentidx.vrb,  sents.vrb  -  files  used  by search code to display sentences illustrating the use of some
       specific verbs

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For each syntactic category, two files are needed to represent the contents of  the  WordNet  database  -
       <b>index.</b><u>pos</u>  and <b>data.</b><u>pos</u>, where <u>pos</u> is <b>noun</b>, <b>verb</b>, <b>adj</b> and <b>adv</b>.  The other auxiliary files are used by the
       WordNet library's searching functions and are needed to run the various WordNet browsers.

       Each index file is an alphabetized list of all the words found in WordNet in the  corresponding  part  of
       speech.   On  each  line,  following  the  word,  is  a  list  of  byte  offsets  (<u>synset_offset</u>s) in the
       corresponding data file, one for each synset containing the word.  Words in the index file are  in  lower
       case  only,  regardless  of  how  they  were  entered  in  the  lexicographer  files.  This folds various
       orthographic representations of the word into one line enabling database searches to be case insensitive.
       See <b><a href="../man5WN/wninput.5WN.html">wninput</a></b>(5WN) for a detailed description of the lexicographer files

       A data file for a syntactic  category  contains  information  corresponding  to  the  synsets  that  were
       specified  in  the  lexicographer  files, with relational pointers resolved to <u>synset_offset</u>s.  Each line
       corresponds to a synset.  Pointers are followed and hierarchies traversed by moving from  one  synset  to
       another via the <u>synset_offset</u>s.

       The  exception  list  files,  <u>pos</u><b>.exc</b>,  are used to help the morphological processor find base forms from
       irregular inflections.

       The files <b>sentidx.vrb</b> and <b>sents.vrb</b> contain sentences illustrating the use of  specific  senses  of  some
       verbs.  These files are used by the searching software in response to a request for verb sentence frames.
       Generic sentence frames are displayed when an illustrative sentence is not present.

       The  various  database  files are in ASCII formats that are easily read by both humans and machines.  All
       fields, unless otherwise noted, are separated by one space character, and all lines are terminated  by  a
       newline character.  Fields enclosed in italicized square brackets may not be present.

       See  <b><a href="../man7WN/wngloss.7WN.html">wngloss</a></b>(7WN)  for  a  glossary of WordNet terminology and a discussion of the database's content and
       logical organization.

   <b>Index</b> <b>File</b> <b>Format</b>
       Each index file begins with several lines containing a  copyright  notice,  version  number  and  license
       agreement.   These  lines all begin with two spaces and the line number so they do not interfere with the
       binary search algorithm that is used to look up entries in the index files.  All other lines are  in  the
       following  format.  In the field descriptions, <b>number</b> always refers to a decimal integer unless otherwise
       defined.

       <u>lemma</u>  <u>pos</u>  <u>synset_cnt</u>  <u>p_cnt</u>  <u>[ptr_symbol...]</u>  <u>sense_cnt</u>  <u>tagsense_cnt</u>   <u>synset_offset</u>  <u>[synset_offset...]</u>

       <u>lemma</u>          lower case ASCII text  of  word  or  collocation.   Collocations  are  formed  by  joining
                      individual words with an underscore (<b>_</b>) character.

       <u>pos</u>            Syntactic  category:  <b>n</b>  for  noun  files,  <b>v</b> for verb files, <b>a</b> for adjective files, <b>r</b> for
                      adverb files.

       All remaining fields are with respect to senses of <u>lemma</u> in <u>pos</u>.

       <u>synset_cnt</u>     Number of synsets that <u>lemma</u> is in.  This is the number of senses of the word in  WordNet.
                      See  <b>Sense</b>  <b>Numbers</b> below for a discussion of how sense numbers are assigned and the order
                      of <u>synset_offset</u>s in the index files.

       <u>p_cnt</u>          Number of different pointers that <u>lemma</u> has in all synsets containing it.

       <u>ptr_symbol</u>     A space separated list of <u>p_cnt</u> different types of pointers that <u>lemma</u> has in all  synsets
                      containing  it.  See  <b><a href="../man5WN/wninput.5WN.html">wninput</a></b>(5WN)  for a list of <u>pointer_symbol</u>s.  If all senses of <u>lemma</u>
                      have no pointers, this field is omitted and <u>p_cnt</u> is <b>0</b>.

       <u>sense_cnt</u>      Same as <u>sense_cnt</u> above.  This is redundant, but the field was preserved for compatibility
                      reasons.

       <u>tagsense_cnt</u>   Number of senses of <u>lemma</u> that are ranked according to their frequency  of  occurrence  in
                      semantic concordance texts.

       <u>synset_offset</u>  Byte offset in <b>data.</b><u>pos</u> file of a synset containing <u>lemma</u>.  Each <u>synset_offset</u> in the list
                      corresponds  to a different sense of <u>lemma</u> in WordNet.  <u>synset_offset</u> is an 8 digit, zero-
                      filled decimal integer that can be used with <b><a href="../man3/fseek.3.html">fseek</a></b>(3) to read a synset from the data file.
                      When passed to <b><a href="../man3WN/read_synset.3WN.html">read_synset</a></b>(3WN) along  with  the  syntactic  category,  a  data  structure
                      containing the parsed synset is returned.

   <b>Data</b> <b>File</b> <b>Format</b>
       Each  data  file  begins  with  several  lines  containing a copyright notice, version number and license
       agreement.  These lines all begin with two spaces and the line  number.   All  other  lines  are  in  the
       following format.  Integer fields are of fixed length, and are zero-filled.

       <u>synset_offset</u>  <u>lex_filenum</u>  <u>ss_type</u>  <u>w_cnt</u>  <u>word</u>  <u>lex_id</u>  <u>[word</u>  <u>lex_id...]</u>  <u>p_cnt</u>  <u>[ptr...]</u>  <u>[frames...]</u>  <b>|</b>  <u>gloss</u>

       <u>synset_offset</u>  Current byte offset in the file represented as an 8 digit decimal integer.

       <u>lex_filenum</u>    Two  digit  decimal  integer  corresponding  to the lexicographer file name containing the
                      synset.  See <b><a href="../man5WN/lexnames.5WN.html">lexnames</a></b>(5WN) for the list of filenames and their corresponding numbers.

       <u>ss_type</u>        One character code indicating the synset type:

                      <b>n</b>    NOUN
                      <b>v</b>    VERB
                      <b>a</b>    ADJECTIVE
                      <b>s</b>    ADJECTIVE SATELLITE
                      <b>r</b>    ADVERB

       <u>w_cnt</u>          Two digit hexadecimal integer indicating the number of words in the synset.

       <u>word</u>           ASCII form of a word as entered in the synset by the lexicographer, with  spaces  replaced
                      by  underscore characters (<b>_</b>).  The text of the word is case sensitive, in contrast to its
                      form in the corresponding  <b>index.</b><u>pos</u>  file,  that  contains  only  lower-case  forms.   In
                      <b>data.adj</b>,  a  <u>word</u>  is  followed  by  a  syntactic  marker  if  one  was  specified in the
                      lexicographer file.  A syntactic marker is appended, in parentheses, onto <u>word</u> without any
                      intervening spaces.  See <b><a href="../man5WN/wninput.5WN.html">wninput</a></b>(5WN) for a list of the syntactic markers for adjectives.

       <u>lex_id</u>         One digit hexadecimal integer that, when appended onto <u>lemma</u>, uniquely identifies a  sense
                      within  a lexicographer file.  <u>lex_id</u> numbers usually start with <b>0</b>, and are incremented as
                      additional senses of the word are added to the same file, although there is no requirement
                      that the numbers be consecutive or begin with <b>0</b>.  Note that a value of <b>0</b> is  the  default,
                      and therefore is not present in lexicographer files.

       <u>p_cnt</u>          Three  digit  decimal  integer indicating the number of pointers from this synset to other
                      synsets.  If <u>p_cnt</u> is <b>000</b> the synset has no pointers.

       <u>ptr</u>            A pointer from this synset to another.  <u>ptr</u> is of the form:

                      <u>pointer_symbol</u>  <u>synset_offset</u>  <u>pos</u>  <u>source/target</u>

                      where <u>synset_offset</u> is the byte offset of the target synset in the data file corresponding
                      to <u>pos</u>.

                      The <u>source/target</u> field distinguishes lexical and semantic pointers.  It is  a  four  byte
                      field,  containing two two-digit hexadecimal integers.  The first two digits indicates the
                      word number in the current (source) synset, the last two digits indicate the  word  number
                      in  the  target  synset.   A value of <b>0000</b> means that <u>pointer_symbol</u> represents a semantic
                      relation  between  the  current  (source)  synset  and  the  target  synset  indicated  by
                      <u>synset_offset</u>.

                      A  lexical  relation  between  two  words  in different synsets is represented by non-zero
                      values in the source and target word numbers.  The first and last two bytes of this  field
                      indicate  the  word  numbers in the source and target synsets, respectively, between which
                      the relation holds.  Word numbers are assigned to the <u>word</u> fields in a synset,  from  left
                      to right, beginning with <b>1</b>.

                      See  <b><a href="../man5WN/wninput.5WN.html">wninput</a></b>(5WN)  for  a  list  of  <u>pointer_symbol</u>s,  and  semantic  and  lexical pointer
                      classifications.

       <u>frames</u>         In <b>data.verb</b> only, a list of numbers corresponding to the generic verb sentence frames for
                      <u>word</u>s in the synset.  <u>frames</u> is of the form:

                      <u>f_cnt</u>   <b>+</b>   <u>f_num</u>  <u>w_num</u>  <u>[</u> <b>+</b>   <u>f_num</u>  <u>w_num...]</u>

                      where <u>f_cnt</u> a two digit decimal integer indicating the number of  generic  frames  listed,
                      <u>f_num</u>  is  a  two digit decimal integer frame number, and <u>w_num</u> is a two digit hexadecimal
                      integer indicating the word in the synset that the frame applies to.  As with pointers, if
                      this number is <b>00</b>, <u>f_num</u> applies  to  all  <u>word</u>s  in  the  synset.   If  non-zero,  it  is
                      applicable  only  to  the  word  indicated.   Word  numbers  are assigned as described for
                      pointers.  Each <u>f_num</u>  <u>w_num</u> pair is preceded by a <b>+</b>.  See <b><a href="../man5WN/wninput.5WN.html">wninput</a></b>(5WN) for  the  text  of
                      the generic sentence frames.

       <u>gloss</u>          Each synset contains a gloss.  A <u>gloss</u> is represented as a vertical bar (<b>|</b>), followed by a
                      text string that continues until the end of the line.  The gloss may contain a definition,
                      one or more example sentences, or both.

   <b>Sense</b> <b>Numbers</b>
       Senses  in  WordNet  are generally ordered from most to least frequently used, with the most common sense
       numbered <b>1</b>.  Frequency of use is determined by the number of times a  sense  is  tagged  in  the  various
       semantic  concordance  texts.   Senses  that  are not semantically tagged follow the ordered senses.  The
       <u>tagsense_cnt</u> field for each entry in the <b>index.</b><u>pos</u> files indicates how many of the  senses  in  the  list
       have been tagged.

       The  <b><a href="../man5WN/cntlist.5WN.html">cntlist</a></b>(5WN)  file  provided with the database lists the number of times each sense is tagged in the
       semantic concordances.  The data from <b>cntlist</b> is used by <b><a href="../man1WN/grind.1WN.html">grind</a></b>(1WN) to order the  senses  of  each  word.
       When the <b>index</b>.<u>pos</u> files are generated, the <u>synset_offset</u>s are output in sense number order, with sense 1
       first  in  the  list.   Senses  with the same number of semantic tags are assigned unique but consecutive
       sense numbers.  The WordNet <b>OVERVIEW</b> search displays all senses of the specified word, in  all  syntactic
       categories, and indicates which of the senses are represented in the semantically tagged texts.

   <b>Exception</b> <b>List</b> <b>File</b> <b>Format</b>
       Exception lists are alphabetized lists of inflected forms of words and their base forms.  The first field
       of  each  line  is an inflected form, followed by a space separated list of one or more base forms of the
       word.  There is one exception list file for each syntactic category.

       Note that the noun and  verb  exception  lists  were  automatically  generated  from  a  machine-readable
       dictionary,  and contain many words that are not in WordNet.  Also, for many of the inflected forms, base
       forms could be easily derived using  the  standard  rules  of  detachment  programmed  into  Morphy  (See
       <b><a href="../man7WN/morph.7WN.html">morph</a></b>(7WN)).  These anomalies are allowed to remain in the exception list files, as they do no harm.

   <b>Verb</b> <b>Example</b> <b>Sentences</b>
       For  some  verb  senses, example sentences illustrating the use of the verb sense can be displayed.  Each
       line of the file <b>sentidx.vrb</b> contains a <u>sense_key</u> followed by a space  and  a  comma  separated  list  of
       example  sentence  template  numbers,  in  decimal.  The file <b>sents.vrb</b> lists all of the example sentence
       templates.  Each line begins with the template number followed by a space.  The rest of the line  is  the
       text  of a template example sentence, with <b>%s</b> used as a placeholder in the text for the verb.  Both files
       are sorted alphabetically so that the <u>sense_key</u> and template sentence number can be used as indices,  via
       <b><a href="../man3WN/binsrch.3WN.html">binsrch</a></b>(3WN), into the appropriate file.

       When a request for <b>FRAMES</b> is made, the WordNet search code looks for the sense in <b>sentidx.vrb</b>.  If found,
       the  sentence  template(s)  listed is retrieved from <b>sents.vrb</b>, and the <b>%s</b> is replaced with the verb.  If
       the sense is not found, the applicable generic sentence frame(s) listed in <u>frames</u> is displayed.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Information in the <b>data.</b><u>pos</u> and <b>index.</b><u>pos</u> files represents all of the word  senses  and  synsets  in  the
       WordNet database.  The <u>word</u>, <u>lex_id</u>, and <u>lex_filenum</u> fields together uniquely identify each word sense in
       WordNet.  These can be encoded in a <u>sense_key</u> as described in <b><a href="../man5WN/senseidx.5WN.html">senseidx</a></b>(5WN).  Each synset in the database
       can  be  uniquely  identified by combining the <u>synset_offset</u> for the synset with a code for the syntactic
       category (since it is possible for synsets in different <b>data.</b><u>pos</u> files to have the same <u>synset_offset</u>).

       The WordNet system provide both command line and window-based browser interfaces to the  database.   Both
       interfaces  utilize  a common library of search and morphology code.  The source code for the library and
       interfaces is included in the WordNet package.  See <b><a href="../man3WN/wnintro.3WN.html">wnintro</a></b>(3WN) for an overview of  the  WordNet  source
       code.
