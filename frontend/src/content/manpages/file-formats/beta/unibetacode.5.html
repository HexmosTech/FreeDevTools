</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       unibetacode - Format for polytonic Beta Code files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>source_file.beta</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Unibetacode</b>  is  an  implementation  of  Beta  Code,  as  adopted by the University of California, Irvine
       Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) Program and the Tufts University Perseus  Project,  among  others.   Beta
       Code provides a way of encoding polytonic Greek characters using plain ASCII characters.  The <b>unibetacode</b>
       package contains three utility programs: <b><a href="../man1/unibetaprep.1.html">unibetaprep</a></b>(1) converts TLG-unique numeric codes to Unicode code
       points,  <b><a href="../man1/beta2uni.1.html">beta2uni</a></b>(1) converts a Beta Code file to UTF-8 Unicode, and <b><a href="../man1/uni2beta.1.html">uni2beta</a></b>(1) converts a UTF-8 Unicode
       file to Beta Code.  These programs can also process Coptic and some Hebrew, but historically the focus of
       Beta Code documents has been classical Greek.  The package also contains <b>libunibetacode</b>,  which  provides
       functions for conversion between Beta Code and UTF-8 Unicode.

       A  Unicode  <u>code</u>  <u>point</u>  is  an  assignment  to a specific numeric value for glyphs and other entities in
       Unicode fonts.  Throughout this document, Unicode code points are given by their Unicode  numeric  values
       in  the  form  U+xxxx,  where  "xxxx"  is a string of four hexadecimal digits representing a glyph in the
       Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane.  This  is  the  notational  convention  in  The  Unicode  Standard  and
       elsewhere.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>PUNCTUATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>PUNCTUATION</b> <b>COMMON</b> <b>TO</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>MODES</b>
       Regardless of the language mode (Greek, Latin, Coptic, or Hebrew), several punctuation marks are retained
       as is between the input file and the output file.  They are as follows:

               .        Full Stop (Period)

               ,        Comma

               ?        Question Mark (except in Greek mode, where it becomes a Combining Dot Below)

               !        Exclamation Mark

               ;        Semicolon / Greek Question Mark (see the Greek section below)

               [ ]      Square Brackets

   <b>QUOTATION</b> <b>MARK</b> <b>STYLES</b>
       The  TLG  Beta  Code  specification  supports  nine different styles of quotation mark.  While support of
       different styles is beneficial, this complicates round-trip conversion from  Beta  Code  to  Unicode  and
       back.   This is further complicated by the same Unicode character being used as an opening quotation mark
       in one style and as a closing quotation mark in another style.

       <b>Double</b> <b>quotes</b> in the <b>unibetacode</b> package just use ASCII quotation marks in a Beta Code source  file;  the
       quotation  style  is  determined  by  the  language  mode.  This greatly simplifies round-trip conversion
       between Beta Code and a Unicode UTF-8 document.  Double quotation marks  must  be  balanced.   The  first
       quotation  mark encountered will be interpreted as a left quotation mark for the chosen style, the second
       will be interpreted as a right quotation mark, and so  on.   Double  quotation  marks  are  converted  as
       follows:

               Greek, Coptic
                        The  opening  double  quotation  mark  is rendered as U+00AB, LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE
                        QUOTATION MARK.  The closing double quotation mark is rendered as U+00BB, RIGHT-POINTING
                        DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK.

               Hebrew   The opening double quotation mark is rendered as U+201E, DOUBLE  LOW-9  QUOTATION  MARK.
                        The closing double quotation mark is rendered as U+201D, RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK.

               Latin    The  opening  double  quotation  mark is rendered as U+201C, LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK.
                        The closing double quotation mark is rendered as U+201D, RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK.

       <b>Single</b> <b>quotes</b> are specified explicitly.  For Latin and Hebrew, they are specified  with  a  grave  accent
       (U+0060)  for  an  opening single quote and an apostrophe (U+0027) for a closing single quote.  For Greek
       and Coptic, they are specified with a "&lt;" for an opening single quote and a  "&gt;"  for  a  closing  single
       quote.  The use of "&lt;" and "&gt;" for Greek and Coptic was a compromise so that an ASCII apostrophe in Greek
       mode  would  render as U+02BC, MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE.  As with double quotation marks, the rendering
       of these characters is dependent on the language mode.  Single quotation marks are converted as follows:

               Greek, Coptic
                        The opening single quotation mark is rendered  as  U+2039,  SINGLE  LEFT-POINTING  ANGLE
                        QUOTATION  MARK.  The closing single quotation mark is rendered as U+203A, SINGLE RIGHT-
                        POINTING ANGLE QUOTATION MARK.

               Hebrew   The opening single quotation mark is rendered as U+201A, SINGLE  LOW-9  QUOTATION  MARK.
                        The closing single quotation mark is rendered as U+2018, LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK.

               Latin    The  opening  single  quotation  mark is rendered as U+2018, LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK.
                        The closing single quotation mark is rendered as U+2019, RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENSIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>ASCII</b> <b>AND</b> <b>UNICODE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>unibetacode</b> package includes two extensions to TLG Beta Code: one for efficiently inserting an  ASCII
       string into text when not in Latin mode, and the other for inserting a Unicode code point in any language
       mode.  These are described in the following two sub-sections.

   <b>ASCII</b> <b>STRING</b> <b>INSERTION</b>
       An  ASCII string can be enclosed in curly brackets when in a non-Latin language mode.  The string will be
       output verbatim.  This can be useful if a Greek text uses ASCII symbols, in  order  to  produce  a  Greek
       document  with  an  ASCII  colon  (':')  rather than a Unicode "GREEK ANO TELEIA" character, U+0387.  The
       format is as follows:

               {<u>ASCII-string</u>}

       <u>This</u> <u>is</u> <u>an</u> <u>extension</u> <u>to</u> <u>standard</u> <u>Beta</u> <u>Code;</u> <u>the</u> <u>TLG</u> <u>specification</u> <u>assigns</u> <u>a</u> <u>different</u>  <u>use</u>  <u>to</u>  <u>'{'.</u>   By
       itself,  the  use of '{' not followed by a decimal number is deprecated in the TLG specification, so this
       should avoid some conflict.  Curly brackets are not allowed in the string.

   <b>SPECIAL</b> <b>UNICODE</b> <b>CHARACTER</b> <b>INSERTION</b>
       The original Beta Code specification lists many numeric codes for producing special  symbols  that  today
       have  become  part  of  The  Unicode  Standard.   In the future, it will likely be most beneficial if any
       specialized numeric codes for characters use Unicode code points rather than the historical TLG Beta Code
       numeric assignments.

       The <b>unibetacode</b> package allows any Unicode code point to be specified in hexadecimal (which  is  how  The
       Unicode  Standard  provides  them)  as  a  string inside an ASCII '{'...'}' escape sequence.  The Unicode
       hexadecimal code point of one to six digits is preceded by "\u", taking the form "\u<u>x...x</u>".  For example,
       strings such as

               {\u3d8} or {\u3D8} or {\u03D8}

       can be used to insert the Unicode character U+03D8, GREEK LETTER ARCHAIC KOPPA, which does  not  have  an
       associated  Beta  Code  letter  assignment.   Such  Unicode  code  point  strings can be mixed with other
       characters in the same string, as long as any character that follows the Unicode  code  point  is  not  a
       hexadecimal digit of '0'-'9', 'A'-'F', or 'a'-'f'.

   <b>NUMERIC</b> <b>DIGITS</b>
       The  numeric  digits '0' through '9' are simply entered as '0' through '9', respectively, in any language
       mode.  The language modes are Coptic, Greek, Hebrew, and Latin.  They  are  described  in  the  following
       sections.

</pre><h4><b>GREEK</b></h4><pre>
   <b>LETTERS</b>
       Capital  and  small  letters  can  take  the  same  set of accent marks, but the order in which these are
       specified differs between capital and small.

       Small letters are given in Beta Code in this order: (1) letter, (2) breathing marks, (3) accents, and (4)
       iota subscript.  This follows the traditional typed appearance of small polytonic  Greek  letters,  where
       breathing marks and then accent marks appear on top of the small letter, and iota subscripts appear below
       small long vowels.

       Capital  letters are given in Beta Code in this order: (1) asterisk (which denotes a Capital letter), (2)
       breathing marks, (3) accents, (4) letter, and (5) iota subscript.  This  follows  the  traditional  typed
       appearance  of capital polytonic Greek letters, where breathing marks and then accent marks appear to the
       left of the capital letter, and iota subscripts appear to the right of capital long vowels.

       The letter mapping is as follows, in  Greek  alphabetical  order.   Letters  can  be  capital  or  small;
       generally speaking, small is easier to read, so it is the default output from <b><a href="../man1/uni2beta.1.html">uni2beta</a></b>(1):

               *a or a    Capital or Small Alpha, respectively

               *b or b    Capital or Small Beta, resp.

               *g or g    Capital or Small Gamma, resp.

               *d or d    Capital or Small Delta, resp.

               *e or e    Capital or Small Epsilon, resp.

               *z or z    Capital or Small Zeta, resp.

               *h or h    Capital or Small Eta, resp.

               *q or q    Capital or Small Theta, resp.

               *i or i    Capital or Small Iota, resp.

               *k or k    Capital or Small Kappa, resp.

               *l or l    Capital or Small Lambda, resp.

               *m or m    Capital or Small Mu, resp.

               *n or n    Capital or Small Nu, resp.

               *c or c    Capital or Small Xi, resp.

               *o or o    Capital or Small Omicron, resp.

               *p or p    Capital or Small Pi, resp.

               *r or r    Capital or Small Rho, resp.

               *s or s    Capital  or  Small  Sigma,  resp.  Note: a small "s" is interpreted as middle (medial)
                          sigma or final sigma depending upon the context.  To force one or the other,  see  the
                          following two entries.

               s1         Small Middle (Medial) Sigma

               s2 or j    Small Final Sigma

               *s3 or s3  Capital or Small Lunate Sigma, resp.

               *t or t    Capital or Small Tau, resp.

               *u or u    Capital or Small Upsilon, resp.

               *f or f    Capital or Small Phi, resp.

               *x or x    Capital or Small Chi, resp.

               *y or y    Capital or Small Psi, resp.

               *w or w    Capital or Small Omega, resp.

               *v or v    Capital or Small Digamma, resp.

       Example:  "*to  fws",  "the light" (without accent marks).  This could also be written as "*TO FWS"; both
       capital and small letters give the same conversion into UTF-8.

   <b>BREATHING</b> <b>MARKS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ACCENTS</b>
       These are the encodings of breathing marks and accents.  In Beta Code (as in  written  Greek),  breathing
       marks appear before accents.

               )        Smooth Breathing

               (        Rough Breathing

               \        Grave accent

               ?        Combining Dot Below

       Example:  "*to\  fw=s",  "the  light",  with  a grave accent, or <u>varia,</u> over the omicron and a circumflex
       accent, or <u>perispomeni,</u> over the omega.  This could also be written as "*TO\ FW=S".  <b>N.B.:</b> Note that  the
       case  of  the  Latin letter does not matter for accent placement; it is only the case of the Greek letter
       that matters.  Greek capital letters are encoded with a preceding asterisk, so in this example, "O\"  and
       "W=" will appear as small UTF-8.

   <b>IOTA</b> <b>SUBSCRIPT</b>
       The  iota  subscript  is the last character written after a long vowel with which it appears, whether the
       letter is capital or small.  It is denoted by a vertical bar:

               |        Iota subscript

   <b>GREEK</b> <b>PUNCTUATION</b>
       These are the punctuation symbols that the <b>unibetacode</b> package supports:

               .                  Period (<u>Teleia</u>)

               ,                  Comma

               :                  Middle Dot (<u>Ano</u> <u>Teleia</u>)

               ;                  Question Mark (<u>Epotematiko</u>)

               ´                  Apostrophe (<u>Apostrophos</u>)

               _ (underscore)     Em Dash

               #                  Greek Number Sign

   <b>UNICODE</b> <b>GREEK</b>
       The Greek Extended range of The Unicode Standard, U+1F00 - U+1FFF, contains 16 small and  capital  vowels
       that have identical representation in the Greek and Coptic range, U+0370 - U+03FF.  These are vowels with
       an  "oxia" (acute) accent in the Greek Extended range; they have equivalent glyphs with a "tonos" (acute)
       accent in the Greek and Coptic range.  Because of this duplication, the use of these  16  Greek  Extended
       glyphs  is  deprecated.   <b><a href="../man1/uni2beta.1.html">uni2beta</a></b>(1) will convert those 16 characters to Beta Code, but <b><a href="../man1/beta2uni.1.html">beta2uni</a></b>(1) will
       convert the resulting Beta Code into characters in the Greek and Coptic range (U+0370 - U+03FF); it  will
       <u>not</u>  convert them back into Greek Extended glyphs.  The default settings in the <b>libunibetacode</b> library <u>is</u>
       to employ these 16 deprecated Unicode code points, but that can be modified;  see  the  <b><a href="../man3/libunibetacode.3.html">libunibetacode</a></b>(3)
       man page for details.

       Also  in  the  Greek  Extended  Unicode range, the TLG Project considers U+1FBF to be the equivalent of a
       smooth breathing mark, and <b><a href="../man1/uni2beta.1.html">uni2beta</a></b>(1) will convert it as such.

</pre><h4><b>LATIN</b> <b>(ASCII)</b></h4><pre>
       To display ASCII characters, including the Latin letters 'A' through 'Z' and 'a' through 'z', begin  with
       an ampersand ('&amp;') character.  Switch back to Greek mode with a dollar sign ('$') character.

       ASCII  characters can also be surrounded with curly brackets; for example, "{Here is some ASCII!}".  This
       is non-standard though; the TLG specification uses '&amp;' and '$' to enter Latin and  then  switch  back  to
       Greek.

       For  efficiency,  <b><a href="../man1/beta2uni.1.html">beta2uni</a></b>(1)  is  conditioned  to  interpret  sequences that look like accented Greek as
       accented Greek.  Curly brackets can also be useful for overriding such interpretations.  For example,  if
       a document contained the text

               ...(this is an example)

       The  "e)"  could  be interpreted as a small epsilon with a smooth breathing mark above it.  To break this
       behavior, type

               ...(this is an example{}) <u>or</u> ...(this is an example{)}

       and the Unicode output from <b><a href="../man1/beta2uni.1.html">beta2uni</a></b>(1) will appear as intended.  This technique will appear familiar  to
       TeX users.

</pre><h4><b>COPTIC</b></h4><pre>
       To  display  Coptic  letters, begin with the character sequence "&amp;100".  Switch back to Greek mode with a
       dollar sign ('$') character.  As with Greek Beta Code, capital Coptic letters in Beta Code begin with  an
       asterisk ('*') and small Coptic letters do not.

       <u>Note</u>  <u>that</u>  <u>unlike</u>  <u>in</u>  <u>Greek</u>  <u>mode,</u> <u>the</u> <u>Coptic</u> <u>Beta</u> <u>Code</u> <u>letters</u> <u>are</u> <u>case-sensitive.</u>  In general, Coptic
       letters derived from Demotic use lowercase Beta Codes and map to the Greek and Coptic Unicode  script  in
       the  range  U+03E2  -  U+03EF;  the  rest  of  the Coptic letters use uppercase Beta Codes and map to the
       separate Coptic Unicode script in the range U+2C80 - U+2C8D.

       The encoding is as follows:

               *A or A    Capital or Small Alfa, respectively

               *B or B    Capital or Small Vida, resp.

               *G or G    Capital or Small Gamma, resp.

               *D or D    Capital or Small Dalda, resp.

               *E or E    Capital or Small Eie, resp.

               *V or V    Capital or Small Sou, resp.

               *Z or Z    Capital or Small Zata, resp.

               *H or H    Capital or Small Hate, resp.

               *Q or Q    Capital or Small Tethe, resp.

               *I or I    Capital or Small Iauda, resp.

               *K or K    Capital or Small Kapa, resp.

               *L or L    Capital or Small Laula, resp.

               *M or M    Capital or Small Mi, resp.

               *N or N    Capital or Small Ni, resp.

               *C or C    Capital or Small Ksi, resp.

               *O or O    Capital or Small O, resp.

               *P or P    Capital or Small Pi, resp.

               *R or R    Capital or Small Ro, resp.

               *S or S    Capital or Small Sima, resp.

               *T or T    Capital or Small Tau, resp.

               *Y or Y    Capital or Small Psi, resp.

               *W or W    Capital or Small Oou, resp.

               *s or s    Capital or Small Shei, resp.

               *g or g    Capital or Small Shima, resp.

               *t or t    Capital or Small Dei, resp.

               \          Jinma (Grave) Accent

       Switch back to Greek mode by ending with a dollar sign ('$') character.

</pre><h4><b>HEBREW</b></h4><pre>
       The TLG specification only covers the basic Hebrew letters aleph through tav.  These letters map  to  the
       Hebrew  Unicode script in the range U+05D0 - U+05EA.  Beta Codes are not defined in the specification for
       cantillation marks, Yiddish digraphs, etc.

       To display Hebrew letters, begin with the character sequence "&amp;300".

       <u>Note</u> <u>that</u> <u>unlike</u> <u>in</u> <u>Greek</u> <u>mode,</u> <u>the</u> <u>Hebrew</u> <u>Beta</u> <u>Codes</u> <u>are</u> <u>case-sensitive</u> <u>and</u> <u>they</u>  never  <u>begin</u>  <u>with</u>  <u>an</u>
       <u>asterisk</u> <u>('*').</u>

       The encoding is as follows:

              A    Alef

</pre><h4><b>SAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  directory  "examples"  in  the source distribution  contains samples with mappings from Beta Code to
       UTF-8 and vice versa.  The "genesis-1-1.beta" and "genesis-1-1.utf8" files show the verse Genesis 1:1  in
       Koine Greek (from the Septuagint), Hebrew, and Bohairic Coptic in Beta Code and UTF-8, respectively.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  format  is  very  straightforward and no known bugs exist.  However, Beta Code has been evolving for
       almost 50 years, especially since the advent of Unicode.  As a result, many Beta  Code-encoded  documents
       exist  in  versions  of  the  standard  much  older than the current version.  This version also does not
       implement many numbered codes that are contained in the TLG Beta Code specification.  There are no  plans
       to support the TLG Beta Code formatting codes, as that is beyond the scope of Unicode.
