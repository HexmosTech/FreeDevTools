       addresses - Specifying addresses within a Shorewall configuration

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In both Shorewall and Shorewall6, there are two basic types of addresses:

       Host Address
           This address type refers to a single host.

           In IPv4, the format is <u>i.j.k.l</u> where <u>i</u> through <u>l</u> are decimal numbers between 1 and 255.

           In IPv6, the format is <u>a:b:c:d:e:f:g:h</u> where <u>a</u> through <u>h</u> consist of 1 to 4 hexadecimal digits
           (leading zeros may be omitted). a single series of 0 addresses may be omitted. For example
           2001:227:e857:1:0:0:0:0:1 may be written 2001:227:e857:1::1.

       Network Address
           A network address refers to 1 or more hosts and consists of a host address followed by a slash ("/")
           and a Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM). This is known as Classless Internet Domain Routing (CIDR)
           notation.

           The VLSM is a decimal number. For IPv4, it is in the range 0 through 32. For IPv6, the range is 0
           through 128. The number represents the number of leading bits in the address that represent the
           network address; the remainder of the bits are a host address and are generally given as zero.

           Examples:

           IPv4: 192.168.1.0/24

           IPv6: 2001:227:e857:1:0:0:0:0:1/64

       In the Shorewall documentation and manpages, we have tried to make it clear which type of address is
       accepted in each specific case.

       Because Shorewall uses a colon (":") as a separator in many contexts, IPv6 addresses are best written
       using the standard convention in which the address itself is enclosed in square brackets:
           [2001:227:e857:1::1]
           [2001:227:e857:1::]/64

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>SOURCE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DEST</b></h4><pre>
       Entries in Shorewall configuration files often deal with the source (SOURCE) and destination (DEST) of
       connections and Shorewall implements a uniform way for specifying them.

       A SOURCE or DEST consists of one to three parts separated by colons (":"):

        1. ZONE — The name of a zone declared in /etc/shorewall/zones or /etc/shorewall6/zones. This part is
           only available in the rules file (/etc/shorewall/rules, /etc/shorewall/blrules,/etc/shorewall6/rules
           and /etc/shorewall6/blrules).

        2. INTERFACE — The name of an interface that matches an entry in /etc/shorewall/interfaces
           (/etc/shorewall6/interfaces).

           Beginning with Shorweall 5.2.1, the <u>interface</u> may be preceded with '!' which matches all interfaces
           except the one specified.

        3. ADDRESS LIST — A list of one or more addresses (host or network) or address ranges, separated by
           commas. In an IPv6 configuration, this list must be included in square or angled brackets ("[...]" or
           "&lt;...&gt;"). The list may have exclusion.

       Examples.

        1. All hosts in the <b>net</b> zone — <b>net</b>

        2. Subnet 192.168.1.0/29 in the <b>loc</b> zone — <b>loc:192.168.1.0/29</b>

        3. All hosts in the net zone connecting through ppp0 — <b>net:ppp0</b>

        4. All hosts interfaced by eth3 — <b>eth3</b>

        5. Subnet 10.0.1.0/24 interfacing through eth2 — <b>eth2:10.0.1.0/24</b>

        6. Host 2002:ce7c:92b4:1:a00:27ff:feb1:46a9 in the <b>loc</b> zone — <b>loc:[2002:ce7c:92b4:1:a00:27ff:feb1:46a9]</b>

        7. The primary IP address of eth0 in the $FW zone - <b>$FW:&amp;eth0</b>

        8. All hosts in Vatican City - <b>net:^VA</b> (Requires the <u>GeoIP</u> <u>Match</u> capability).

</pre><h4><b>IP</b> <b>ADDRESS</b> <b>RANGES</b></h4><pre>
       If you kernel and iptables have <u>IP</u> <u>Range</u> <u>match</u> <u>support</u>, you may use IP address ranges in Shorewall
       configuration file entries; IP address ranges have the syntax &lt;<u>low</u> <u>IP</u> <u>address</u>&gt;-&lt;<u>high</u> <u>IP</u> <u>address</u>&gt;.

       Example: 192.168.1.5-192.168.1.12.
