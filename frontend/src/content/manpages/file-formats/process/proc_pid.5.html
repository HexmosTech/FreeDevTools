       /proc/pid/, <a href="file:/proc/self/">/proc/self/</a> - process information

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/</u>
              There  is  a  numerical  subdirectory  for  each running process; the subdirectory is named by the
              process ID.  Each <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid subdirectory  contains  the  pseudo-files  and  directories  described
              below.

              The  files  inside each <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid directory are normally owned by the effective user and effective
              group ID of the process.  However, as a security measure, the ownership is made <u>root:root</u>  if  the
              process's "dumpable" attribute is set to a value other than 1.

              Before  Linux  4.11, <u>root:root</u> meant the "global" root user ID and group ID (i.e., UID 0 and GID 0
              in the initial user namespace).  Since Linux  4.11,  if  the  process  is  in  a  noninitial  user
              namespace  that  has  a  valid  mapping  for user (group) ID 0 inside the namespace, then the user
              (group) ownership of the files under <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid is instead made the same as the root  user  (group)
              ID  of  the  namespace.   This  means  that  inside  a  container, things work as expected for the
              container "root" user.

              The process's "dumpable" attribute may change for the following reasons:

              •  The attribute was explicitly set via the <b><a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</a></b>(2) <b>PR_SET_DUMPABLE</b> operation.

              •  The attribute was reset to the value in the file <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable">/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</a></u> (described  below),
                 for the reasons described in <b><a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</a></b>(2).

              Resetting  the  "dumpable"  attribute  to  1 reverts the ownership of the <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/*</u> files to the
              process's effective UID and GID.  Note, however, that if the effective UID or GID is  subsequently
              modified, then the "dumpable" attribute may be reset, as described in <b><a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</a></b>(2).  Therefore, it may
              be  desirable  to reset the "dumpable" attribute <u>after</u> making any desired changes to the process's
              effective UID or GID.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/self/">/proc/self/</a></u>
              This directory refers to the process accessing the <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u> filesystem, and is identical to the <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u>
              directory named by the process ID of the same process.
