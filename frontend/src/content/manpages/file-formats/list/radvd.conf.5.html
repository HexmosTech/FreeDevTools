</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       radvd.conf - configuration file of the router advertisement daemon <b>radvd</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  file  describes  the  information  which is included in the router advertisement (RA) of a specific
       interface.

       The file contains one or more interface definitions of the form:

       <b>interface</b> name <b>{</b>
            list of interface specific options
            list of prefix definitions
            list of clients (IPv6 addresses) to advertise to
            list of route definitions
            list of RDNSS definitions
            list of DNSSL definitions
            list of ABRO definitions
            list of NAT64 pref64 definitions
            list of auto-ignore prefixes
            list of acceptable RA source addresses
       <b>};</b>

       All the possible interface specific options are detailed below.  Each option has to be  terminated  by  a
       semicolon. Options are not case sensitive.

       Prefix definitions are of the form:

       <b>prefix</b> prefix<b>/</b>length <b>{</b>
            list of prefix specific options
       <b>};</b>

       Prefix  can  be  network prefix or the address of the interface.  The address of interface should be used
       when using Mobile IPv6 extensions.

       Special prefix "::/64" is also supported on  systems  that  implement  getifaddrs()  (on  other  systems,
       configuration  activation fails and radvd exits).  When configured, radvd picks all non-link-local prefix
       assigned to the interface and starts advertising it (unless ignored with autoignoreprefixes).   This  may
       be  applicable in non-6to4 scenarios where the upstream prefix might change.  This option is incompatible
       with Base6to4Interface option.  AdvRouterAddr option is always enabled when this configuration is used.

       All the possible prefix specific options are described below.  Each option has  to  be  terminated  by  a
       semicolon.

       Decimal values are allowed only for MinDelayBetweenRAs, MaxRtrAdvInterval and MinRtrAdvInterval.  Decimal
       values should be used only when using Mobile IPv6 extensions.

       Route definitions are of the form:

       <b>route</b> prefix<b>/</b>length <b>{</b>
            list of route specific options
       <b>};</b>

       The  prefix  of  a  route  definition should be network prefix; it can be used to advertise more specific
       routes to the hosts.

       RDNSS (Recursive DNS server) definitions are of the form:

       <b>RDNSS</b> ip [ip] [ip] <b>{</b>
            list of rdnss specific options
       <b>};</b>

       Each RDNSS definition block has a maximum length of 2040 bytes including the header, this accomodates  up
       to 127 addresses.

       If the length is exceeded, radvd will log a non-fatal error instead of sending the option.

       DNSSL (DNS Search List) definitions are of the form:

       <b>DNSSL</b> suffix [suffix] [suffix] [...] <b>{</b>
            list of dnssl specific options
       <b>};</b>

       Each  DNSSL  definition  block has a maximum length of 2040 bytes including the header, applied after the
       suffixes are encoded per RFC1035, section 3.1.

       If the length is exceeded, radvd will log a non-fatal error instead of sending the option.

       By default radvd will send multicast route advertisements so that every node on the link  can  use  them.
       The  list  of  clients  (IPv6  address)  to  advertise  to,  and  accept  route solicitations from can be
       configured.  If done, radvd does not send messages to the  multicast  addresses  but  to  the  configured
       unicast  addresses  only.   Solicitations  from other addresses are refused unless UnrestrictedUnicast is
       enabled.  This is similar to UnicastOnly but  includes  periodic  messages  and  incoming  client  access
       configuration.  See examples section for a use case of this.

       The definitions are of the form:

       <b>clients</b> <b>{</b>
               list of IPv6 addresses
       <b>};</b>

       Clients can be prefixed with "!" to ignore them completely and never send advertisements to them.

       By  default radvd will use the first link-local address for the interface as the source address for route
       advertisements. This can be overwritten by manually setting the list of acceptable source  addresses.  If
       done,  radvd  will  use  the  first  address  from the interface that is present in the configured source
       addresses only. This functionality will NOT spoof the source address, but may be  useful  in  combination
       with VRRP or other functionality that do a virtual/failover MAC.

       <b>AdvRASrcAddress</b> <b>{</b>
               list of IPv6 addresses
       <b>};</b>

       ABRO (Authoritative Border Router Option) definitions are of the form:

       <b>abro</b> IPv6-address <b>{</b>
               list of abro specific options
       <b>};</b>

       NAT64 pref64 (the NAT64 prefix included in the router advertisements):

       <b>nat64prefix</b> prefix<b>/</b>length <b>{</b>
            list of NAT64 prefix specific options
       <b>};</b>

       The value of <b>length</b> can only be one of /32, /40, /48, /56, /64, or /96.

       When  using  the  special prefix "::/64" this option forms an ignore list for prefixes that should not be
       automatically generated and advertised. Has no effect on any other prefix definition.

       The definitions are of the form:

       <b>autoignoreprefixes</b> <b>{</b>
               list of IPv6 prefixes
       <b>};</b>

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>IgnoreIfMissing</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              A flag indicating whether or not the interface is ignored if it does not exist at start-up.

              This is useful for dynamic interfaces which  are  not  active  when  radvd  starts  or  which  are
              dynamically disabled and re-enabled during the time radvd runs.

              Current versions of radvd automatically try to re-enable interfaces.

              Enabling  IgnoreIfMissing  also  quenches  certain  warnings  in  log messages relating to missing
              interfaces.

              Default: on

       <b>AdvSendAdvert</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              A flag indicating whether or not the router sends periodic router advertisements and  responds  to
              router solicitations.

              This  option no longer has to be specified first, but it needs to be <b>on</b> to enable advertisement on
              this interface.

              Default: off

       <b>UnicastOnly</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              Indicates that the interface link type only  supports  unicast.   This  will  prevent  unsolicited
              advertisements  from  being  sent,  and  will  cause solicited advertisements to be unicast to the
              soliciting node.  This option is necessary  for  non-broadcast,  multiple-access  links,  such  as
              ISATAP.

              Default: off

       <b>UnrestrictedUnicast</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              A  flag  indicating  whether  or  not  to  respond to router solicitations when there is a list of
              clients configured.

              This allows regular unsolicited advertisements to be sent to some clients without ignoring  router
              solicitations from unknown clients.

              Default: off

       <b>AdvRASolicitedUnicast</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              Indicates  that  router  solicitations will be responded to with unicast router advertisements, as
              recommended by RFC7772.  Large  networks  with  a  high  concentration  of  mobile  devices  might
              experience like battery depletion, when solicited Router Advertisement messages are multicast.

              This corresponds to the Cisco IOS option <b>ipv6</b> <b>nd</b> <b>ra</b> <b>solicited</b> <b>unicast</b>

              Default: on

       <b>MaxRtrAdvInterval</b> seconds

              The  maximum  time  allowed  between  sending unsolicited multicast router advertisements from the
              interface, in seconds.

              Must be no less than 4 seconds and no greater than 1800 seconds.

              Minimum when using Mobile IPv6 extensions: 0.07.

              For values less than 0.2 seconds, 0.02 seconds is added to account for scheduling granularities as
              specified in RFC3775.

              Default: 600 seconds

       <b>MinRtrAdvInterval</b> seconds

              The minimum time allowed between sending unsolicited  multicast  router  advertisements  from  the
              interface, in seconds.

              Must be no less than 3 seconds and no greater than 0.75 * MaxRtrAdvInterval.

              Minimum when using Mobile IPv6 extensions: 0.03.

              Default: 0.33 * MaxRtrAdvInterval

       <b>MinDelayBetweenRAs</b> seconds

              The  minimum  time  allowed between sending multicast router advertisements from the interface, in
              seconds.

              This  applies  to  solicited  multicast  RAs.   This  is  defined   as   the   protocol   constant
              MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_RAS  in  RFC4861.   MIPv6  redefines  this  parameter  to have a minimum of 0.03
              seconds.

              Minimum when using Mobile IPv6 extensions: 0.03.

              Default: 3

       <b>AdvManagedFlag</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              When set, hosts use the administered (stateful) protocol for address autoconfiguration in addition
              to any addresses autoconfigured using stateless address autoconfiguration.  The use of  this  flag
              is described in RFC 4862.

              Default: off

       <b>AdvOtherConfigFlag</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              When  set,  hosts  use  the  administered (stateful) protocol for autoconfiguration of other (non-
              address) information.  The use of this flag is described in RFC 4862.

              Default: off

       <b>AdvLinkMTU</b> integer

              The MTU option is used in  router advertisement messages to ensure that all nodes on  a  link  use
              the same MTU value in those cases where the link MTU is not well known.

              If  specified,  i.e.  not  0,  must  not be smaller than 1280 and not greater than the maximum MTU
              allowed for this link (e.g. ethernet has a maximum MTU of 1500. See RFC 4864).

              Default: 0

       <b>AdvReachableTime</b> milliseconds

              The time, in milliseconds, that a node assumes a neighbor is reachable  after  having  received  a
              reachability  confirmation.   Used by the Neighbor Unreachability Detection algorithm (see Section
              7.3 of RFC 4861).  A value of zero means unspecified (by this router).

              Must be no greater than 3,600,000 milliseconds (1 hour).

              Default: 0

       <b>AdvRetransTimer</b> milliseconds

              The time, in milliseconds, between retransmitted Neighbor Solicitation messages.  Used by  address
              resolution  and  the  Neighbor Unreachability Detection algorithm (see Sections 7.2 and 7.3 of RFC
              4861).  A value of zero means unspecified (by this router).

              Default: 0

       <b>AdvCurHopLimit</b> integer

              The default value that should be placed in the Hop Count field  of  the  IP  header  for  outgoing
              (unicast) IP packets.  The value should be set to the current diameter of the Internet.  The value
              zero means unspecified (by this router).

              Default: 64

       <b>AdvDefaultLifetime</b> seconds

              The  lifetime  associated  with  the  default  router  in  units  of  seconds.   The maximum value
              corresponds to 18.2 hours.  A lifetime of 0 indicates that the router is not a default router  and
              should  not  appear  on the default router list.  The router lifetime applies only to the router's
              usefulness as a default router; it does not apply to information contained in other message fields
              or options.  Options that need time limits  for  their  information  include  their  own  lifetime
              fields.

              Must be either zero or between MaxRtrAdvInterval and 9000 seconds.

              Default: 3 * MaxRtrAdvInterval (Minimum 1 second).

       <b>AdvDefaultPreference</b> <b>low</b>|<b>medium</b>|<b>high</b>

              The preference associated with the default router, as either "low", "medium", or "high".

              Default: medium

       <b>AdvSourceLLAddress</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              When set, the link-layer address of the outgoing interface is included in the RA.

              Default: on

       <b>RemoveAdvOnExit</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              Upon  shutdown, send a final advertisement with zero Router Lifetime. This should cause the router
              and routes to be immediately removed from the receiving end-nodes' route table. This may  need  to
              be disabled ("off") in an vrrp or carp setup.

              Default: on

       <b>AdvHomeAgentFlag</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              When  set,  indicates  that  sending router is able to serve as Mobile IPv6 Home Agent.  When set,
              minimum limits specified by Mobile IPv6 are used for MinRtrAdvInterval and MaxRtrAdvInterval.

              Default: off

       <b>AdvHomeAgentInfo</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              When set, Home Agent  Information  Option  (specified  by  Mobile  IPv6)  is  included  in  Router
              Advertisements.  AdvHomeAgentFlag must also be set when using this option.

              Default: off

       <b>HomeAgentLifetime</b> seconds

              The  length  of  time  in  seconds  (relative  to  the time the packet is sent) that the router is
              offering Mobile IPv6 Home Agent services.  A value 0 must not be used.  The  maximum  lifetime  is
              65520 seconds (18.2 hours).  This option is ignored, if AdvHomeAgentInfo is not set.

              If  both  HomeAgentLifetime  and  HomeAgentPreference  are set to their default values, Home Agent
              Information Option will not be sent.

              Default: AdvDefaultLifetime

       <b>HomeAgentPreference</b> integer

              The preference for the Home Agent sending  this  Router  Advertisement.   Values  greater  than  0
              indicate more preferable Home Agent, values less than 0 indicate less preferable Home Agent.  This
              option is ignored, if AdvHomeAgentInfo is not set.

              If  both  HomeAgentLifetime  and  HomeAgentPreference  are set to their default values, Home Agent
              Information Option will not be sent.

              Default: 0

       <b>AdvMobRtrSupportFlag</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              When set, the Home Agent signals it  supports  Mobile  Router  registrations  (specified  by  NEMO
              Basic).  AdvHomeAgentInfo must also be set when using this option.

              Default: off

       <b>AdvIntervalOpt</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              When  set,  Advertisement  Interval  Option  (specified  by  Mobile  IPv6)  is  included in Router
              Advertisements.  When set, minimum limits specified by Mobile IPv6 are used for  MinRtrAdvInterval
              and MaxRtrAdvInterval.

              The  advertisement  interval  is  based on the configured MaxRtrAdvInterval parameter except where
              this is less than 200ms.  In this case, the advertised interval is ( MaxRtrAdvInterval + 20ms ).

              Default: off

       <b>AdvCaptivePortalAPI</b> <b>"</b>URL<b>"</b>

              When set, advertise RFC8908 Captive-Portal API URL.

              See RFC8952 Captive Portal Architecture, RFC8910 Captive-Portal Identification in DHCP and  Router
              Advertisements (RAs) and RFC8908 Captive Portal API for more information.

              Most likely you do not need this.

              Default: not included

</pre><h4><b>PREFIX</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AdvOnLink</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              When  set,  indicates  that  this  prefix can be used for on-link determination.  When not set the
              advertisement makes no statement  about  on-link  or  off-link  properties  of  the  prefix.   For
              instance,  the prefix might be used for address configuration with some of the addresses belonging
              to the prefix being on-link and others being off-link.

              Default: on

       <b>AdvAutonomous</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              When set, indicates that this prefix can be used for autonomous address configuration as specified
              in RFC 4862.

              Default: on

       <b>AdvRouterAddr</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              When set, indicates that the address of interface  is  sent  instead  of  network  prefix,  as  is
              required  by  Mobile  IPv6.   When  set,  minimum  limits  specified  by  Mobile IPv6 are used for
              MinRtrAdvInterval and MaxRtrAdvInterval.

              Default: off

       <b>AdvValidLifetime</b> seconds|<b>infinity</b>

              The length of time in seconds (relative to the time the packet is sent) that the prefix  is  valid
              for the purpose of on-link determination.  The symbolic value <b>infinity</b> represents infinity (i.e. a
              value of all one bits (0xffffffff)).  The valid lifetime is also used by RFC 4862.

              Note  that clients will ignore AdvValidLifetime of an existing prefix if the lifetime is below two
              hours, as required in RFC 4862 Section 5.5.3 point e).

              Note: RFC4861's suggested default value is significantly longer: 30 days.

              Default: 86400 seconds (1 day)

       <b>AdvPreferredLifetime</b> seconds|<b>infinity</b>

              The length of time in seconds (relative to the time the packet is sent) that  addresses  generated
              from  the  prefix  via  stateless  address autoconfiguration remain preferred.  The symbolic value
              <b>infinity</b> represents infinity (i.e. a value of all one bits (0xffffffff)).  See RFC 4862.

              Note: RFC4861's suggested default value is significantly longer: 7 days.

              Default: 14400 seconds (4 hours)

       <b>DeprecatePrefix</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              Upon shutdown, this option will cause radvd to deprecate the prefix by announcing it in the  radvd
              shutdown  RA  with  a  zero preferred lifetime and a valid lifetime slightly greater than 2 hours.
              This will encourage end-nodes using this prefix to deprecate any associated addresses immediately.
              Note that this option should only be used when only one router is announcing the prefix  onto  the
              link, otherwise end-nodes will deprecate associated addresses despite the prefix still being valid
              for preferred use.

              See RFC4862, section 5.5.3., "Router Advertisement Processing", part (e).

              Default: off

       <b>DecrementLifetimes</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              This  option  causes  radvd  to  decrement the values of the preferred and valid lifetimes for the
              prefix over time. The lifetimes are decremented by the number of seconds since  the  last  RA.  If
              radvd  receives  a  SIGUSR1  signal, it will reset the values of the preferred and valid lifetimes
              back to the initial values used by radvd when it  started.  If  radvd  never  receives  a  SIGUSR1
              signal,  it  will  continue  to decrement the lifetimes until the preferred lifetime reaches zero.
              After a final RA with a zero value preferred lifetime, radvd will cease to announce the prefix. If
              a SIGUSR1 signal then causes the lifetimes to be reset, the prefix will then re-appear in the RAs.

              This option is intended to be used in conjunction with a DHCPv6 client that is using the  Identity
              Association  for Prefix Delegation (IA_PD) option to acquire a prefix from a Delegating Router for
              use by a Requesting Router. In this scenario, the prefix(es) from within the delegated prefix that
              are announced by radvd would age in parallel with and at the same rate as  the  delegated  prefix,
              and expire at approximately the same time, if the delegated prefix's life isn't extended.

              See RFC3633, "IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6".

              Default: off

       <b>Base6Interface</b> name

              If  this options is specified, this prefix will be combined with the IPv6 address of the interface
              specified by <b>name.</b>  The resulting prefix length will be 64.

       <b>Base6to4Interface</b> name

              If this option is specified, this prefix will be combined with the IPv4 address of interface  <b>name</b>
              to  produce a valid 6to4 prefix. The first 16 bits of this prefix will be replaced by <b>2002</b> and the
              next 32 bits of this prefix will be replaced by the IPv4 address assigned  to  interface  <b>name</b>  at
              configuration  time. The remaining 80 bits of the prefix (including the SLA ID) will be advertised
              as specified in the configuration file.  See the next section for an example.

              If interface <b>name</b> is not available at configuration time, a warning will be written to the log and
              this prefix will be disabled until radvd is reconfigured.

              This option enables systems with dynamic IPv4 addresses to update their advertised  6to4  prefixes
              simply by restarting radvd or sending a SIGHUP signal to cause radvd to reconfigure itself.

              Note that 6to4 prefixes derived from dynamically-assigned IPv4 addresses should be advertised with
              a significantly shorter lifetime (see the <b>AdvValidLifetime</b> and <b>AdvPreferredLifetime</b> options).

              For more information on 6to4, see RFC 3056.

              Default: 6to4 is not used

</pre><h4><b>ROUTE</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AdvRouteLifetime</b> seconds|<b>infinity</b>

              The  lifetime  associated  with  the  route  in  units  of  seconds.   The symbolic value <b>infinity</b>
              represents infinity (i.e. a value of all one bits (0xffffffff)).

              Default: 3 * MaxRtrAdvInterval

       <b>AdvRoutePreference</b> <b>low</b>|<b>medium</b>|<b>high</b>

              The preference associated with the default router, as either "low", "medium", or "high".

              Default: medium

       <b>RemoveRoute</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              Upon shutdown, announce this route with a zero second lifetime. This should cause the route to  be
              immediately removed from the receiving end-nodes' route table.

              Default: on

</pre><h4><b>RDNSS</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AdvRDNSSLifetime</b> seconds<b>|</b>infinity
              The  maximum duration how long the RDNSS entries are used for name resolution.  A value of 0 means
              the nameserver must no longer be used.  As described in RFC8106, the use of  default  value  or  a
              larger  value  ensures  the  reliability  of  an  entry even under the loss of RAs on links with a
              relatively high rate of packet loss.

              Default: 3*MaxRtrAdvInterval

       <b>FlushRDNSS</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              Upon shutdown, announce the RDNSS entries with a zero second lifetime. This should cause the RDNSS
              addresses to be immediately removed from the end-nodes' list of Recursive DNS Servers.

              Default: on

</pre><h4><b>DNSSL</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AdvDNSSLLifetime</b> seconds<b>|</b>infinity;
              The maximum duration how long the DNSSL entries are used for name resolution.  A value of 0  means
              the  suffix  should  no  longer  be  used.  As described in RFC8106, the use of default value or a
              larger value ensures the reliability of an entry even under the  loss  of  RAs  on  links  with  a
              relatively high rate of packet loss.

              Default: 3*MaxRtrAdvInterval

       <b>FlushDNSSL</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>

              Upon shutdown, announce the DNSSL entries with a zero second lifetime. This should cause the DNSSL
              entries to be immediately removed from the end-nodes' DNS search list.

              Default: on

</pre><h4><b>ABRO</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AdvValidLifetime</b> seconds
              The time in units of that the set of border router information is valid.  A value of all zero bits
              assumes a default value of 10,000(~one week).

       <b>AdvVersionLow,</b> <b>AdvVersionHigh</b> unsigned<b>integer</b>
              Both  forms 32-bit unsigned version number corresponding to the set of information contained in RA
              message.

</pre><h4><b>NAT64</b> <b>PREF64</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AdvValidLifetime</b> seconds

              The length of time in seconds (relative to the time the packet is sent) that the prefix  is  valid
              for  the  purpose  of NAT64 existence determination. In case the value is not a multiple of 8, the
              validity is rounded up to the next multiple of 8. The maximum is 65528 seconds.

              Default: the lesser value of 3 * MaxRtrAdvInterval, or 65528

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       interface eth0
       {
               AdvSendAdvert on;
               prefix 2001:db8:0:1::/64
               {
                       AdvOnLink on;
                       AdvAutonomous on;
               };
       };

       It says that router advertisement daemon should advertise (AdvSendAdvert on;) the  prefix  2001:db8:0:1::
       which  has  a  length  of  64  on  the  interface  eth0.   Also the prefix should be marked as autonomous
       (AdvAutonomous on;) and as on-link (AdvOnLink on;).  All the other options  are  left  on  their  default
       values.

       To  support  movement  detection  of  Mobile  IPv6  Mobile Nodes, the address of interface should be used
       instead of network prefix:

       interface eth0
       {
               AdvSendAdvert on;
               prefix 2001:db8:0:1::4/64
               {
                       AdvOnLink on;
                       AdvAutonomous on;
                       AdvRouterAddr on;
               };
       };

       For 6to4 support, include the <b>Base6to4Interface</b> option in each prefix section. When using a dynamic  IPv4
       address, set small prefix lifetimes to prevent hosts from retaining unreachable prefixes after a new IPv4
       address  has  been  assigned.   When  advertising  to  on a dynamic interface (e.g., Bluetooth), skip the
       interface if it is not active yet.

       interface bnep0
       {
               IgnoreIfMissing on;
               AdvSendAdvert on;

               # Advertise at least every 30 seconds
               MaxRtrAdvInterval 30;

               prefix 0:0:0:5678::/64
               {
                       AdvOnLink on;
                       AdvAutonomous on;
                       Base6to4Interface ppp0;

                       # Very short lifetimes for dynamic addresses
                       AdvValidLifetime 300;
                       AdvPreferredLifetime 120;
               };
       };

       Since 6to4 is enabled, the prefix will be advertised as 2002:WWXX:YYZZ:5678::/64,  where  WW.XX.YY.ZZ  is
       the  IPv4  address of ppp0 at configuration time. (IPv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal whereas IPv4
       addresses are written in decimal, so the IPv4 address WW.XX.YY.ZZ in the 6to4 prefix will be  represented
       in hex.)

       In  this  specific  case,  the configuration scripts may send HUP signal to radvd when taking bnep0 up or
       down to notify about the status; in the current radvd releases, sending HUP is no longer  mandatory  when
       the link comes back up.

       interface eth0
       {
               AdvSendAdvert on;
               prefix 2001:db8:0:1::/64
               {
                       AdvOnLink on;
                       AdvAutonomous on;
               };
               clients
               {
                       fe80::21f:16ff:fe06:3aab;
                       fe80::21d:72ff:fe96:aaff;
               };
       };

       This    configuration    would    only    announce    the    prefix   to   fe80::21f:16ff:fe06:3aab   and
       fe80::21d:72ff:fe96:aaff.  Furthermore, all RA requests of other clients are denied.

       This may come in handy if you want to roll out IPv6 only partially because some  clients  are  broken  or
       untested.

       For ABRO support
       interface lowpan0
       {
            AdvSendAdvert on;
            UnicastOnly on;
            AdvCurHopLimit 255;
            prefix 2001:0db8:0100:f101::/64 {
                 AdvOnLink on;
                 AdvAutonomous on;
                 AdvRouterAddr on;
            };
            abro fe80::a200:0:0:1/64 {
                 AdvVersionLow 10;
                 AdvVersionHigh 2;
                 AdvValidLifetime 2;
            };
       };

       The NAT64 pref64 support
       interface eth0
       {
            prefix 2001:db8:100::/64 {
                 AdvOnLink on;
                 AdvAutonomous on;
                 AdvRouterAddr on;
            };
            nat64prefix 64:ff9b::/96 {
                 AdvValidLifetime 1800;
            };
            RDNSS 2001:db8:100::64 {
                 AdvRDNSSLifetime 1800;
            };
