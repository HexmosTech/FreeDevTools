       nsswitch.conf - Name Service Switch configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Name  Service  Switch (NSS) configuration file, <u><a href="file:/etc/nsswitch.conf">/etc/nsswitch.conf</a></u>, is used by the GNU C Library and
       certain other applications to determine the sources from which to obtain name-service  information  in  a
       range of categories, and in what order.  Each category of information is identified by a database name.

       The  file  is  plain  ASCII  text,  with columns separated by spaces or tab characters.  The first column
       specifies the database name.  The remaining columns describe the order of sources to query and a  limited
       set of actions that can be performed by lookup result.

       The following databases are understood by the GNU C Library:

       <b>aliases</b>     Mail aliases, used by <b><a href="../man3/getaliasent.3.html">getaliasent</a></b>(3) and related functions.

       <b>ethers</b>      Ethernet numbers.

       <b>group</b>       Groups of users, used by <b><a href="../man3/getgrent.3.html">getgrent</a></b>(3) and related functions.

       <b>hosts</b>       Host names and numbers, used by <b><a href="../man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname</a></b>(3) and related functions.

       <b>initgroups</b>  Supplementary group access list, used by <b><a href="../man3/getgrouplist.3.html">getgrouplist</a></b>(3) function.

       <b>netgroup</b>    Network-wide  list  of  hosts and users, used for access rules.  C libraries before glibc 2.1
                   supported netgroups only over NIS.

       <b>networks</b>    Network names and numbers, used by <b><a href="../man3/getnetent.3.html">getnetent</a></b>(3) and related functions.

       <b>passwd</b>      User passwords, used by <b><a href="../man3/getpwent.3.html">getpwent</a></b>(3) and related functions.

       <b>protocols</b>   Network protocols, used by <b><a href="../man3/getprotoent.3.html">getprotoent</a></b>(3) and related functions.

       <b>publickey</b>   Public and secret keys for Secure_RPC used by NFS and NIS+.

       <b>rpc</b>         Remote procedure call names and numbers, used by <b><a href="../man3/getrpcbyname.3.html">getrpcbyname</a></b>(3) and related functions.

       <b>services</b>    Network services, used by <b><a href="../man3/getservent.3.html">getservent</a></b>(3) and related functions.

       <b>shadow</b>      Shadow user passwords, used by <b><a href="../man3/getspnam.3.html">getspnam</a></b>(3) and related functions.

       The GNU C Library ignores databases with unknown names.  Some applications use this to implement  special
       handling  for  their  own  databases.  For example, <b><a href="../man8/sudo.8.html">sudo</a></b>(8) consults the <b>sudoers</b> database.  Delegation of
       subordinate user/group IDs can be configured using the <b>subid</b> database.  Refer to <b><a href="../man5/subuid.5.html">subuid</a></b>(5) and  <b><a href="../man5/subgid.5.html">subgid</a></b>(5)
       for more details.

       Here is an example <u><a href="file:/etc/nsswitch.conf">/etc/nsswitch.conf</a></u> file:

           passwd:         compat
           group:          compat
           shadow:         compat

           hosts:          dns [!UNAVAIL=return] files
           networks:       nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
           ethers:         nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
           protocols:      nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
           rpc:            nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
           services:       nis [NOTFOUND=return] files

       The first column is the database name.  The remaining columns specify:

       •  One  or  more service specifications, for example, "files", "db", or "nis".  The order of the services
          on the line determines the order in which those services will be queried, in turn, until a  result  is
          found.

       •  Optional  actions  to  perform  if  a  particular  result  is obtained from the preceding service, for
          example, "[NOTFOUND=return]".

       The service specifications supported on your system depend on the presence of shared libraries,  and  are
       therefore  extensible.   Libraries  called <u>/lib/libnss_SERVICE.so.</u><b>X</b> will provide the named <u>SERVICE</u>.  On a
       standard installation, you can use "files", "db", "nis", and "nisplus".  For the <b>hosts</b> database, you  can
       additionally  specify  "dns".   For the <b>passwd</b>, <b>group</b>, and <b>shadow</b> databases, you can additionally specify
       "compat" (see <b>Compatibility</b> <b>mode</b> below).  The version number <b>X</b> may be 1 for glibc 2.0, or 2 for glibc 2.1
       and later.  On systems with additional libraries installed, you may have access to further services  such
       as "hesiod", "ldap", "winbind", and "wins".

       An  action  may  also  be  specified following a service specification.  The action modifies the behavior
       following a result obtained from the preceding data source.  Action items take the general form:

           [<u>STATUS</u>=<u>ACTION</u>]
           [!<u>STATUS</u>=<u>ACTION</u>]

       where

           <u>STATUS</u> =&gt; <b>success</b> | <b>notfound</b> | <b>unavail</b> | <b>tryagain</b>
           <u>ACTION</u> =&gt; <b>return</b> | <b>continue</b> | <b>merge</b>

       The ! negates the test, matching all possible results except the one specified.  The case of the keywords
       is not significant.

       The <u>STATUS</u> value is matched against the result of the lookup function called  by  the  preceding  service
       specification, and can be one of:

           <b>success</b>     No  error  occurred  and  the  requested  entry is returned.  The default action for this
                       condition is "return".

           <b>notfound</b>    The lookup succeeded, but the requested entry was not found.  The default action for this
                       condition is "continue".

           <b>unavail</b>     The service is permanently unavailable.  This can mean  either  that  the  required  file
                       cannot  be  read,  or, for network services, that the server is not available or does not
                       allow queries.  The default action for this condition is "continue".

           <b>tryagain</b>    The service is temporarily unavailable.  This could mean a file is  locked  or  a  server
                       currently  cannot  accept  more  connections.   The  default action for this condition is
                       "continue".

       The <u>ACTION</u> value can be one of:

           <b>return</b>      Return  a  result  now.   Do  not  call  any  further  lookup  functions.   However,  for
                       compatibility  reasons,  if  this  is  the selected action for the <b>group</b> database and the
                       <b>notfound</b> status, and the configuration file does not contain  the  <b>initgroups</b>  line,  the
                       next lookup function is always called, without affecting the search result.

           <b>continue</b>    Call the next lookup function.

           <b>merge</b>       <u>[SUCCESS=merge]</u>  is  used  between  two database entries.  When a group is located in the
                       first of the two group entries, processing will continue on to  the  next  one.   If  the
                       group  is  also  found in the next entry (and the group name and GID are an exact match),
                       the member list of the second entry will be added to the group  object  to  be  returned.
                       Available  since glibc 2.24.  Note that merging will not be done for <b><a href="../man3/getgrent.3.html">getgrent</a></b>(3) nor will
                       duplicate members be pruned when they occur in both entries being merged.

   <b>Compatibility</b> <b>mode</b> <b>(compat)</b>
       The NSS "compat" service is similar to "files" except that it additionally  permits  special  entries  in
       corresponding  files  for  granting  users  or  members of netgroups access to the system.  The following
       entries are valid in this mode:

           For <b>passwd</b> and <b>shadow</b> databases:

               <b>+</b><u>user</u>       Include the specified <u>user</u> from the NIS passwd/shadow map.

               <b>+</b><u>user::::::</u> Include the specified <u>user</u> from the NIS  passwd  map,  but  override  with  non-empty
                           passwd fields.

               <b>+@</b><u>netgroup</u>  Include all users in the given <u>netgroup</u>.

               <b>-</b><u>user</u>       Exclude the specified <u>user</u> from the NIS passwd/shadow map.

               <b>-@</b><u>netgroup</u>  Exclude all users in the given <u>netgroup</u>.

               <b>+</b>           Include every user, except previously excluded ones, from the NIS passwd/shadow map.

           For <b>group</b> database:

               <b>+</b><u>group</u>      Include the specified <u>group</u> from the NIS group map.

               <b>-</b><u>group</u>      Exclude the specified <u>group</u> from the NIS group map.

               <b>+</b>           Include every group, except previously excluded ones, from the NIS group map.

       By default, the source is "nis", but this may be overridden by specifying any NSS service except "compat"
       itself as the source for the pseudo-databases <b>passwd_compat</b>, <b>group_compat</b>, and <b>shadow_compat</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       A  service named <u>SERVICE</u> is implemented by a shared object library named <u>libnss_SERVICE.so.</u><b>X</b> that resides
       in <u><a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></u>.

           <u><a href="file:/etc/nsswitch.conf">/etc/nsswitch.conf</a></u>       NSS configuration file.
           <u>/lib/libnss_compat.so.</u><b>X</b>  implements "compat" source.
           <u>/lib/libnss_db.so.</u><b>X</b>      implements "db" source.
           <u>/lib/libnss_dns.so.</u><b>X</b>     implements "dns" source.
           <u>/lib/libnss_files.so.</u><b>X</b>   implements "files" source.
           <u>/lib/libnss_hesiod.so.</u><b>X</b>  implements "hesiod" source.
           <u>/lib/libnss_nis.so.</u><b>X</b>     implements "nis" source.
           <u>/lib/libnss_nisplus.so.</u><b>X</b> implements "nisplus" source.

       The following files are read when "files" source is specified for respective databases:

           <b>aliases</b>     <u>/etc/aliases</u>
           <b>ethers</b>      <u>/etc/ethers</u>
           <b>group</b>       <u><a href="file:/etc/group">/etc/group</a></u>
           <b>hosts</b>       <u><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></u>
           <b>initgroups</b>  <u><a href="file:/etc/group">/etc/group</a></u>
           <b>netgroup</b>    <u>/etc/netgroup</u>
           <b>networks</b>    <u><a href="file:/etc/networks">/etc/networks</a></u>
           <b>passwd</b>      <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u>
           <b>protocols</b>   <u><a href="file:/etc/protocols">/etc/protocols</a></u>
           <b>publickey</b>   <u>/etc/publickey</u>
           <b>rpc</b>         <u><a href="file:/etc/rpc">/etc/rpc</a></u>
           <b>services</b>    <u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u>
           <b>shadow</b>      <u><a href="file:/etc/shadow">/etc/shadow</a></u>

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Starting with glibc 2.33, <b>nsswitch.conf</b> is automatically reloaded if the file  is  changed.   In  earlier
       versions,  the  entire  file  was read only once within each process.  If the file was later changed, the
       process would continue using the old configuration.

       Traditionally, there was only a single source for service information, often in  the  form  of  a  single
       configuration file (e.g., <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u>).  However, as other name services, such as the Network Information
       Service  (NIS)  and the Domain Name Service (DNS), became popular, a method was needed that would be more
       flexible than fixed search orders coded into the C library.  The Name Service Switch mechanism, which was
       based on the mechanism used by Sun Microsystems in the Solaris 2 C library, introduced a cleaner solution
       to the problem.
