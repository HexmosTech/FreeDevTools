       pg_autoctl - pg_auto_failover Configuration

       Several defaults settings of pg_auto_failover can be reviewed and changed depending on the trade-offs you
       want  to  implement in your own production setup. The settings that you can change will have an impact of
       the following operations:

          • Deciding when to promote the secondary

            pg_auto_failover decides to implement a failover to the secondary node  when  it  detects  that  the
            primary  node  is  unhealthy.  Changing  the  following  settings  will  have  an impact on when the
            pg_auto_failover monitor decides to promote the secondary PostgreSQL node:

                pgautofailover.health_check_max_retries
                pgautofailover.health_check_period
                pgautofailover.health_check_retry_delay
                pgautofailover.health_check_timeout
                pgautofailover.node_considered_unhealthy_timeout

          • Time taken to promote the secondary

            At secondary promotion time, pg_auto_failover waits for the following timeout to make sure that  all
            pending writes on the primary server made it to the secondary at shutdown time, thus preventing data
            loss.:

                pgautofailover.primary_demote_timeout

          • Preventing promotion of the secondary

            pg_auto_failover  implements  a  trade-off where data availability trumps service availability. When
            the primary node of a PostgreSQL service is detected unhealthy, the secondary is only promoted if it
            was known to be eligible at the moment when the primary is lost.

            In the case when <u>synchronous</u> <u>replication</u> was in use at the moment when the  primary  node  is  lost,
            then we know we can switch to the secondary safely, and the wal lag is 0 in that case.

            In  the case when the secondary server had been detected unhealthy before, then the pg_auto_failover
            monitor switches it from the state SECONDARY to the state CATCHING-UP  and  promotion  is  prevented
            then.

            The following setting allows to still promote the secondary, allowing for a window of data loss:

                pgautofailover.promote_wal_log_threshold

</pre><h4><b>PG_AUTO_FAILOVER</b> <b>MONITOR</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration for the behavior of the monitor happens in the PostgreSQL database where the extension
       has been deployed:

          pg_auto_failover=&gt; select name, setting, unit, short_desc from pg_settings where name ~ 'pgautofailover.';
          -[ RECORD 1 ]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          -[ RECORD 8 ]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       You can edit the parameters as usual with PostgreSQL, either in the <b>postgresql.conf</b> file or  using  <b>ALTER</b>
       <b>DATABASE</b> <b>pg_auto_failover</b> <b>SET</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>=</b> <b>value;</b> commands, then issuing a reload.

</pre><h4><b>PG_AUTO_FAILOVER</b> <b>KEEPER</b> <b>SERVICE</b></h4><pre>
       For  an  introduction  to  the <b>pg_autoctl</b> commands relevant to the pg_auto_failover Keeper configuration,
       please see <u>pg_autoctl</u> <u>config</u>.

       An example configuration file looks like the following:

          [pg_autoctl]
          role = keeper
          monitor = postgres://<a href="mailto:autoctl_node@192.168.1.34">autoctl_node@192.168.1.34</a>:6000/pg_auto_failover
          formation = default
          group = 0
          hostname = node1.db
          nodekind = standalone

          [postgresql]
          pgdata = /data/pgsql/
          pg_ctl = /usr/pgsql-10/bin/pg_ctl
          dbname = postgres
          host = <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>
          port = 5000

          [replication]
          slot = pgautofailover_standby
          maximum_backup_rate = 100M
          backup_directory = /data/backup/node1.db

          [timeout]
          network_partition_timeout = 20
          postgresql_restart_failure_timeout = 20
          postgresql_restart_failure_max_retries = 3

       To output, edit and check entries of the configuration, the following commands are provided:

          pg_autoctl config check [--pgdata &lt;pgdata&gt;]
          pg_autoctl config get [--pgdata &lt;pgdata&gt;] section.option
          pg_autoctl config set [--pgdata &lt;pgdata&gt;] section.option value

       The <b>[postgresql]</b> section is discovered automatically by the <b>pg_autoctl</b> command and is not intended to  be
       changed manually.

       <b>pg_autoctl.monitor</b>

       PostgreSQL service URL of the pg_auto_failover monitor, as given in the output of the <b>pg_autoctl</b> <b>show</b> <b>uri</b>
       command.

       <b>pg_autoctl.formation</b>

       A  single  pg_auto_failover  monitor  may  handle several postgres formations. The default formation name
       <u>default</u> is usually fine.

       <b>pg_autoctl.group</b>

       This information is retrieved by the pg_auto_failover keeper when registering a node to the monitor,  and
       should not be changed afterwards. Use at your own risk.

       <b>pg_autoctl.hostname</b>

       Node  <u>hostname</u>  used  by  all the other nodes in the cluster to contact this node. In particular, if this
       node is a primary then its standby uses that address to setup streaming replication.

       <b>replication.slot</b>

       Name of the PostgreSQL replication slot used in the streaming replication setup automatically deployed by
       pg_auto_failover. Replication slots can't be renamed in PostgreSQL.

       <b>replication.maximum_backup_rate</b>

       When pg_auto_failover (re-)builds a standby node using the <b>pg_basebackup</b> command, this parameter is given
       to <b>pg_basebackup</b> to throttle the network bandwidth used. Defaults to 100Mbps.

       <b>replication.backup_directory</b>

       When pg_auto_failover (re-)builds a standby node using the <b>pg_basebackup</b> command, this parameter  is  the
       target  directory where to copy the bits from the primary server. When the copy has been successful, then
       the directory is renamed to <b>postgresql.pgdata</b>.

       The default value is computed from <b>${PGDATA}/../backup/${hostname}</b> and can be set to any  value  of  your
       preference. Remember that the directory renaming is an atomic operation only when both the source and the
       target of the copy are in the same filesystem, at least in Unix systems.

       <b>timeout</b>

       This section allows to setup the behavior of the pg_auto_failover keeper in interesting scenarios.

       <b>timeout.network_partition_timeout</b>

       Timeout  in  seconds  before  we  consider  failure  to  communicate with other nodes indicates a network
       partition. This check is only done on a PRIMARY server, so other nodes mean  both  the  monitor  and  the
       standby.

       When  a  PRIMARY  node  is detected to be on the losing side of a network partition, the pg_auto_failover
       keeper enters the DEMOTE state and stops the PostgreSQL instance in order to protect against split  brain
       situations.

       The default is 20s.

       <b>timeout.postgresql_restart_failure_timeout</b>

       <b>timeout.postgresql_restart_failure_max_retries</b>

       When PostgreSQL is not running, the first thing the pg_auto_failover keeper does is try to restart it. In
       case of a transient failure (e.g. file system is full, or other dynamic OS resource constraint), the best
       course  of  action  is  to  try again for a little while before reaching out to the monitor and ask for a
       failover.

       The pg_auto_failover keeper tries to  restart  PostgreSQL  <b>timeout.postgresql_restart_failure_max_retries</b>
       times  in  a  row (default 3) or up to <b>timeout.postgresql_restart_failure_timeout</b> (defaults 20s) since it
       detected that PostgreSQL is not running, whichever comes first.
