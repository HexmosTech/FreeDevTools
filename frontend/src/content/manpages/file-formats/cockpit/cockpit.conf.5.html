</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cockpit.conf - Cockpit configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Cockpit can be configured via /etc/cockpit/cockpit.conf. If $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is set, then the first path
       containing a ../cockpit/cockpit.conf is used instead. Other configuration files and directories are
       searched for in the same way.

       This file is not required and may need to be created manually. The file has a INI file syntax and thus
       contains key / value pairs, grouped into topical groups. See the examples below for details.

       Note: The port that cockpit listens on cannot be changed in this file. To change the port change the
       systemd cockpit.socket file.

</pre><h4><b>WEBSERVICE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Origins</b>
           By default cockpit will not accept crossdomain websocket connections. Use this setting to allow
           access from alternate domains. Origins should include scheme, host and port, if necessary. Wildcards
           and glob expressions are permitted.

               [WebService]
               Origins = https://somedomain1.com https://somedomain2.com:9090 https://*.somedomain3.com

       <b>ProtocolHeader</b>
           Configure cockpit to look at the contents of this header to determine if a connection is using tls.
           This should only be used when cockpit is behind a reverse proxy, and care should be taken to make
           sure that incoming requests cannot set this header.

               [WebService]
               ProtocolHeader = X-Forwarded-Proto

       <b>ForwardedForHeader</b>
           Configure cockpit to look at the contents of this header to determine the real origin of a
           connection. This should only be used when cockpit is behind a reverse proxy, and care should be taken
           to make sure that incoming requests cannot set this header.

               [WebService]
               ForwardedForHeader = X-Forwarded-For

       <b>LoginTitle</b>
           Set the browser title for the login screen.

       <b>LoginTo</b>
           When set to true the <u>Connect</u> <u>to</u> option on the login screen is visible and allows logging into another
           server. When set to false, direct remote logins are disallowed. If this option is not specified then
           it will be automatically detected based on whether the <b>cockpit-bridge</b> package is installed and the
           <b>ssh</b> program is available.

           If cockpit-ws is exposed to the public internet, and also has access to a private internal network,
           it is recommended to explicitly set LoginTo=false. This prevents unauthenticated remote attackers
           from scanning the internal network for existing machines and open ports.

       <b>RequireHost</b>
           When set to true cockpit will require users to use the <u>Connect</u> <u>to</u> option to specify the host to log
           into.

       <b>AllowMultiHost</b>
           When set to true, cockpit will allow users to connect to multiple hosts in one session. The default
           is OS specific.

           When connecting to multiple servers, JavaScript runs without isolation. All systems will be
           vulnerable to potential attacks from other connected hosts. Enable this option <u>only</u> when all hosts
           are trusted.

       <b>MaxStartups</b>
           Same as the <b>sshd</b> configuration option by the same name. Specifies the maximum number of concurrent
           login attempts allowed. Additional connections will be dropped until authentication succeeds or the
           connections are closed. Defaults to 10.

           Alternatively, random early drop can be enabled by specifying the three colon separated values
           start:rate:full (e.g. "10:30:60"). Cockpit will start refusing authentication attempts with a
           probability of rate/100 (30%) if there are currently start (10) unauthenticated connections. The
           probability increases linearly and all connection attempts are refused if the number of
           unauthenticated connections reaches full (60).

       <b>AllowUnencrypted</b>
           If true, cockpit will accept unencrypted HTTP connections. Otherwise, it redirects all HTTP
           connections to HTTPS. Exceptions are connections from localhost and for certain URLs (like /ping).
           Defaults to false.

       <b>UrlRoot</b>
           The root URL where you will be serving cockpit. When provided cockpit will expect all requests to be
           prefixed with the given url. This is mostly useful when you are using cockpit behind a reverse proxy,
           such as nginx.  /cockpit/ and /cockpit+ are reserved and should not be used. For example
           /cockpit-new/ is ok.  /cockpit/ and /cockpit+new/ are not.

       <b>ClientCertAuthentication</b>
           If true, enable TLS client certificates for authenticating users. Commonly these are provided by a
           smart card, but it's equally possible to import certificates directly into the web browser. Please
           see the <b>Certificate/smart</b> <b>card</b> <b>authentication</b>[1] section in the Cockpit guide for details.

       <b>Shell</b>
           The relative URL to top level component to display in Cockpit once logged in. Defaults to
           /shell/index.html

</pre><h4><b>LOG</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Fatal</b>
           The kind of log messages in the bridge to treat as fatal. Separate multiple values with spaces.
           Relevant values are: criticals and warnings.

</pre><h4><b>OAUTH</b></h4><pre>
       Cockpit can be configured to support the <b>implicit</b> <b>grant</b>[2] OAuth authorization flow. When successful the
       resulting oauth token will be passed to cockpit-ws using the Bearer auth-scheme. For a login to be
       successful, cockpit will also need a to be configured to verify and allow Bearer tokens.

       <b>URL</b>
           This is the url that cockpit will redirect the users browser to when it needs to obtain an oauth
           token. Cockpit will add a redirect_uri parameter to the url with the location of where the oauth
           provider should redirect to once a token has been obtained.

       <b>ErrorParam</b>
           When a oauth provider redirects a user back to cockpit, look for this parameter in the querystring or
           fragment portion of the url to find a error message. When not provided it will default to
           error_description

       <b>TokenParam</b>
           When a oauth provider redirects a user back to cockpit, look for this parameter in the querystring or
           fragment portion of the url to find the access token. When not provided it will default to
           access_token

</pre><h4><b>SESSION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Banner</b>
           The contents of the specified file (commonly <a href="file:/etc/issue">/etc/issue</a>) are shown on the login page. By default, no
           banner is displayed.

       <b>IdleTimeout</b>
           Time in minutes after which session expires and user is logged out if no user action has been
           performed in the given time. This idle timeout only applies to interactive password logins. With
           non-interactive authentication methods like Kerberos, OAuth, or certificate login, the browser cannot
           forget credentials, and thus automatic logouts are not useful for protecting credentials of forgotten
           sessions. Set to 0 to disable session timeout.

               [Session]
               IdleTimeout=15
           When not specified, there is no idle timeout by default.

       <b>WarnBeforeConnecting</b>
           Whether to warn before connecting to remote hosts from the Shell. Defaults to true.

               [Session]
               WarnBeforeConnecting=false
