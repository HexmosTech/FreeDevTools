</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       accounting - Grid Engine accounting file format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An  accounting  record is written to the Grid Engine accounting file <u>$SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/reporting</u>
       for each finished job if <b>accounting=true</b> is specified in the <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5) <b>reporting_params</b>.   This  occurs
       at  intervals of the <b>accounting_flush_time</b> specified in the same place.  The accounting file is processed
       by <u><a href="../man1/qacct.1.html">qacct</a></u>(1) to derive accounting statistics.

       If output to the <u><a href="../man5/reporting.5.html">reporting</a></u>(5) file is enabled, accounting records containing  similar  data  are  written
       there.   They  include  "intermediate"  records  written at midnight for long-running jobs, not just ones
       written at the end of the jobs, and so may be more appropriate to process  for  some  purposes  than  the
       accounting file.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Each  job  is  represented  by  a  line  in the accounting file. Empty lines, and lines which contain one
       character or less are ignored  by  <u>qacct</u>.   Accounting  record  entries  are  separated  by  colon  (':')
       characters. The entries denote in their order of appearance:

   <b>1.</b> <b>qname</b>
       Name of the cluster queue in which the job has run.

   <b>2.</b> <b>hostname</b>
       Name of the execution host.

   <b>3.</b> <b>group</b>
       The effective group id of the job owner when executing the job.

   <b>4.</b> <b>owner</b>
       Owner of the Grid Engine job.

   <b>5.</b> <b>job_name</b>
       Job name.

   <b>6.</b> <b>job_number</b>
       Job identifier (job number).

   <b>7.</b> <b>account</b>
       An account string as specified by the <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1) or <u><a href="../man1/qalter.1.html">qalter</a></u>(1) <b>-A</b> option.

   <b>8.</b> <b>priority</b>
       Priority  value  assigned  to the job, corresponding to the <b>priority</b> parameter in the queue configuration
       (see <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5)).

   <b>9.</b> <b>submission_time</b>
       Submission time in seconds since the Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).

   <b>10.</b> <b>start_time</b>
       Start time in seconds since the epoch.

   <b>11.</b> <b>end_time</b>
       End time in seconds since the epoch.

   <b>12.</b> <b>failed</b>
       Indicates the problem which occurred in case a job failed (at the system level, as  opposed  to  the  job
       script  or  binary having non-zero exit status, see below).  Possibly the job could not be started on the
       execution host (e.g. because the owner of the job did not have a  valid  account  on  that  machine),  or
       didn't finish successfully (e.g. because an execution host crashed).  If Grid Engine tries to start a job
       multiple  times,  there  may  be multiple entries in the reporting file corresponding to the same job ID.
       See <u><a href="../man5/sge_status.5.html">sge_status</a></u>(5) for a list.

   <b>13.</b> <b>exit_status</b>
       Exit status of the job script (or Grid Engine-specific status in case of certain error conditions).   The
       exit  status is determined by following the normal shell conventions.  If the command terminates normally
       the value of the command is its exit status.  However, in the case that the command exits  abnormally,  a
       value of 0200 (octal), 128 (decimal) is added to the value of the command to make up the exit status.

       For  example:  If a job dies through signal 9 (SIGKILL) - probably issued by Grid Engine through <u><a href="../man1/qdel.1.html">qdel</a></u>(1),
       or because the job exceeded time or memory hard limits - then the  exit  status  is  128 + 9 = 137.   The
       reason  Grid Engine killed a job is recorded in the execd <u>messages</u> file at "W" or "I" level, depending on
       why it was killed.

   <b>14.</b> <b>ru_wallclock</b>
       Difference between <b>end_time</b> and <b>start_time</b> (see above), except that if the job fails, it is zero.

   <b>15.</b> <b>ru_utime</b>
   <b>16.</b> <b>ru_stime</b>
   <b>17.</b> <b>ru_maxrss</b>
   <b>18.</b> <b>ru_ixrss</b>
   <b>19.</b> <b>ru_ismrss</b>
   <b>20.</b> <b>ru_idrss</b>
   <b>21.</b> <b>ru_isrss</b>
   <b>22.</b> <b>ru_minflt</b>
   <b>23.</b> <b>ru_majflt</b>
   <b>24.</b> <b>ru_nswap</b>
   <b>25.</b> <b>ru_inblock</b>
   <b>26.</b> <b>ru_oublock</b>
   <b>27.</b> <b>ru_msgsnd</b>
   <b>28.</b> <b>ru_msgrcv</b>
   <b>29.</b> <b>ru_nsignals</b>
   <b>30.</b> <b>ru_nvcsw</b>
   <b>31.</b> <b>ru_nivcsw</b>
       These entries follow the contents of the standard Unix rusage structure  as  described  in  <u><a href="../man2/getrusage.2.html">getrusage</a></u>(2).
       Depending on the operating system where the job was executed, some of the fields may be 0.

   <b>32.</b> <b>project</b>
       The project which was assigned to the job.

   <b>33.</b> <b>department</b>
       The department which was assigned to the job.

   <b>34.</b> <b>granted_pe</b>
       The parallel environment which was selected for the job.

   <b>35.</b> <b>slots</b>
       The number of slots which were dispatched to the job by the scheduler.

   <b>36.</b> <b>task_number</b>
       Array job task index number.

   <b>37.</b> <b>cpu</b>
       The CPU time usage in seconds.  The value may be affected by the ACCT_RESERVED_USAGE execd parameter (see
       <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5)).

   <b>38.</b> <b>mem</b>
       The  integral memory usage in Gbytes seconds.  The value may be affected by the ACCT_RESERVED_USAGE execd
       parameter (see <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5)).

   <b>39.</b> <b>io</b>
       The amount of data transferred in input/output operations in GB (if available, otherwise 0).   On  Linux,
       this  is summed over calls to <u><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></u>(2), <u><a href="../man2/pread.2.html">pread</a></u>(2), <u><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></u>(2), and <u><a href="../man2/pwrite.2.html">pwrite</a></u>(2); thus it includes i/o via cache,
       and may not reflect data actually written to filing system.

   <b>40.</b> <b>category</b>
       A string specifying the job category.  This contains a space-separated pseudo options list for  the  job,
       with components as follows:

       <b>-U</b> <u>user_list</u>
              An   owner/group   ACL   list   composed   from   <u><a href="../man5/host_conf.5.html">host_conf</a></u>(5),   <u><a href="../man5/sge_pe.5.html">sge_pe</a></u>(5),   And   <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5)
              <b>user_lists</b>/<b>xuser_lists</b> entries.  Entries from <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5) are not considered since they  can  only
              cause  a  job  to be accepted/rejected at submit time.  Omitted if there are no such configuration
              entries.

       <b>-P</b> <u>project_list</u>
              Like <b>-U</b>, but for <b>project</b>/<b>xproject</b> entries.

       <b>-u</b> <u>owner</u>
              The owner's user name, if it was referenced in any RQS (see  <u><a href="../man5/sge_resource_quota.5.html">sge_resource_quota</a></u>(5)).   Omitted  if
              there was no such reference.

       <b>-q</b> <u>queue_list</u>
              The hard queue list (only if one was specified).

       <b>-masterq</b> <u>queue_list</u>
              The master queue list (only if one was specified).

       <b>-pe</b> <u>pe_name</u> <u>pe_range</u>
              The parallel environment specified for the job (only for parallel jobs).

       <b>-ckpt</b> <u>ckpt_name</u>
              The job's checkpointing environment (only if one was specified).

       <b>-I</b> <u>y</u>   Present only for interactive jobs.

       <b>-ar</b> <u>ar_id</u>
              The advance reservation into which the job was submitted (only if one was specified).

   <b>41.</b> <b>iow</b>
       The input/output wait time in seconds (if available, otherwise 0).

   <b>42.</b> <b>pe_taskid</b>
       If  this  identifier  is  not  equal to <b>NONE</b>, the task was part of a parallel job, and was passed to Grid
       Engine via the <b>qrsh</b> <b>-inherit</b> interface.  Such records are not produced  if  the  PE's  <b>accounting_summary</b>
       parameter is false (see <u><a href="../man5/sge_pe.5.html">sge_pe</a></u>(5)).

   <b>43.</b> <b>maxvmem</b>
       The  maximum  vmem  size  in bytes.  The value may be affected by the ACCT_RESERVED_USAGE execd parameter
       (see <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5)).

   <b>44.</b> <b>arid</b>
       Advance reservation identifier. If the job used the resources of an advance reservation, then this  field
       contains a positive integer identifier; otherwise the value is "<b>0</b>".

   <b>45.</b> <b>ar_sub_time</b>
       Advance  reservation  submission  time if the job uses the resources of an advance reservation; otherwise
       "<b>0</b>".
