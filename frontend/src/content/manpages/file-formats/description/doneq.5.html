       doneq/q* - <u>HylaFAX</u> outbound job description

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Files  in  the  <b>doneq</b>  directory specify transmission job requests.  These files are created by <u><a href="../man8/hfaxd.8.html">hfaxd</a></u>(8),
       when submitting a job on behalf of <u><a href="../man1/sendfax.1.html">sendfax</a></u>(1) or <u><a href="../man1/sendpage.1.html">sendpage</a></u>(1).  Job description files also reside  in  the
       <b>sendq</b> directory; they are moved from there to the doneq directory by <u><a href="../man8/faxq.8.html">faxq</a></u>(8) when a job completes.

       Job description files are ASCII files with lines of the form
            <b>tag</b>: <u>value</u>
       where  a  <u>tag</u> is one of the identifiers described below and a <u>value</u> is either a string or number.  Values
       start at the first non-blank character after the ``:'' and continue to the end of the line.   Lines  that
       end  with  a  backslash  character  ``\''  are  continued  to  the next line.  Numeric values are decimal
       integers, except for <b>chophreshold</b> which is expressed as a floating point value.

       The following table lists the possible tags and the required type of the associated value.
              <b>Tag</b>             <b>Type</b>       <b>Description</b>

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that all files must be owned by the fax user.  Pathnames for document files must be relative to  the
       top of the <u>HylaFAX</u> spooling directory and not include ``..''.

       <b>chopthreshold</b> The  minimum  trailing  whitespace  (in  inches)  that  must  appear on a page for it to be
                     considered for ``page chopping''.  If this  parameter  is  not  specified  then  the  value
                     specified by the <b>PageChopThreshold</b> configuration parameter is used; see <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-config.5.html">hylafax-config</a></u>(5).

       <b>commid</b>        The  communication  identifier for the last outbound call placed for this job.  This string
                     is of the form ``XXXXXXXX'' where XXXXXXXX is  a  decimal  sequence  number  in  the  range
                     1-99999999.

       <b>client</b>        The  fully  qualified  hostname  for  the machine from which the job was submitted.  If the
                     hostname is unknown at the time the job is submitted, then the  host  address  in  Internet
                     standard ``.'' (dot) notation is supplied instead.

       <b>company</b>       The  receiver's  company name as specified with the <b>-x</b> option to <u><a href="../man1/sendfax.1.html">sendfax</a></u>(1).  This value is
                     used only when creating continuation cover pages.

       <b>cover</b>         The pathname of a <u>continuation</u> <u>cover</u> <u>page</u> to send.  The file must be TIFF/F (i.e.  it  must
                     already  be prepared for transmission).  This document will be transmitted before any other
                     documents listed in the file.  See <b>ContCoverPage</b> and <b>ContCoverCmd</b> in <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-config.5.html">hylafax-config</a></u>(5).

       <b>data</b>          The pathname of a document to send.  Once a document has been processed, it  is  marked  as
                     <b>!data</b> so that subsequent retries do not reprocess the document.

       <b>dataformat</b>    The  format  used  to transmit facsimile data.  This item is recorded by <u><a href="../man8/faxsend.8.html">faxsend</a></u>(8) so that
                     <u><a href="../man8/notify.8.html">notify</a></u>(8) can return it in a notification message.

       <b>desiredbr</b>     The desired signalling rate to use for page data transmissions: 0 for 2400 bps, 1 for  4800
                     bps, 2 for 7200 bps, 3 for 9600 bps, 4 for 12000 bps, and 5 for 14400 bps (default).

       <b>desireddf</b>     The  desired  data format to use for page data transmissions: 0 for 1-D MH, 1 for 2-D MR, 3
                     for 2-D MR with uncompressed data, and 4 for 2-D MMR (default).

       <b>desiredec</b>     Which type of Error Correction Mode (ECM) to use: 0 to disable, 1 for 64-byte ECM, or 2 for
                     256-byte ECM (default).

       <b>desiredst</b>     The desired minimum scanline time to use for page data transmissions: 0 for 0 ms (default),
                     1 for 5 ms, 2 for 10ms/5ms, 3 for 10ms, 4 for 20ms/10ms, 5 for 20ms, 6 for 40ms/20ms, and 7
                     for 40ms.  This value is used in selecting the negotiated session parameters.

       <b>desiredtl</b>     Whether or not to use the format string specified by the <b>tagline</b> job parameter when imaging
                     taglines on document pages.  If this value is non-zero then per-job format string is  used;
                     otherwise the tagline format string specified in the server configuration file is used; see
                     <b>TagLineFormat</b> in <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-config.5.html">hylafax-config</a></u>(5).

       <b>doneop</b>        The  treatment the job should be given when it is processed by the <u><a href="../man8/faxqclean.8.html">faxqclean</a></u>(8) job cleaner
                     program.  The may be one of <u>remove</u> (to expunge the job description file and all  associated
                     documents  that  are not referenced by another job) or <u>archive</u> (to request that the job and
                     associated documents be archived on the server machine).  Consult <u>faxqclean</u> more details on
                     other information that may be included in this string.

       <b>external</b>      The external form of the dialstring.  This string is used instead of the dialstring in  any
                     status and log messages.  Clients can protect private information such as access codes that
                     must be placed in dialstrings by supplying a ``cleansed'' version of the dialstring.

       <b>fax</b>           The  pathname  of a TIFF/F document that is ready for transmission.  If the pathname string
                     has a leading ``xx:'', then ``xx'' is interpreted to be the index of the first directory in
                     the file to transmit (directories are numbered starting at zero).

       <b>groupid</b>       The job group identifier, an integer number in the range 1 to 32000 assigned to each  group
                     of jobs by the <u>HylaFAX</u> software.  Each job in a group of jobs submitted at the same time is
                     assigned the same value by the <u>HylaFAX</u> software.

       <b>jobid</b>         The job identifier, a unique integer number in the range 1 to 32000 assigned to each job by
                     the <u>HylaFAX</u> software.

       <b>jobtag</b>        A  user-specified  string  that is intended for identification purposes.  If this string is
                     defined, it is returned to the user in notification messages instead of the job identifier.

       <b>killtime</b>      The time to kill this job, expressed in seconds since 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970.

       <b>location</b>      The receiver's location as specified with the <b>-y</b> option to <u><a href="../man1/sendfax.1.html">sendfax</a></u>(1).  This value is  used
                     only when creating continuation cover pages.

       <b>mailaddr</b>      The electronic mail address to which notification messages should be directed.

       <b>maxdials</b>      The  maximum  number  of  times  the  server  should  dial the phone.  If the job cannot be
                     completed in this number of calls, it is terminated.

       <b>maxtries</b>      The maximum number of times the server should attempt to send a job; where  an  attempt  is
                     defined  to  be  a  session  that  makes  it  past  Phase A of the CCITT T.30 protocol (for
                     facsimile), or similar.  If the job cannot be completed in this  number  of  tries,  it  is
                     terminated.

       <b>minsp</b>         The  minimum signalling rate to use for transmitting page data: 0 for 2400 bps (default), 1
                     for 4800 bps, 2 for 7200 bps, 3 for 9600 bps, 4 for 12000 bps, and 5 for 14400 bps.

       <b>modem</b>         The outgoing modem to use to send the job, or ``any'' if any available modem is acceptable.

       <b>owner</b>         The identity of the user that owns the job.  Typically the owner is the user  that  created
                     the  job,  though  clients with administrative privileges can change the ownership of jobs.
                     The value is the string specified in the USER command passed  to  <u><a href="../man8/hfaxd.8.html">hfaxd</a></u>(8)  when  a  client
                     logins in to the server.

       <b>notify</b>        A  specification  of  whether  the  sender wants notification: whenever the job is requeued
                     after a failed attempt to transmit (``<u>when</u> <u>requeued</u>''), when the job is  completed  (``<u>when</u>
                     <u>done</u>''), either of the above (``<u>when</u> <u>done+requeued</u>''), or not at all (``<u>none</u>'').

       <b>npages</b>        The number of pages in the facsimile, including the cover page, that have been successfully
                     transmitted.

       <b>ntries</b>        The number of unsuccessful attempts that have been made to transmit the current page.

       <b>ndials</b>        The  number  of  consecutive unsuccessful attempts to establish carrier with the the remote
                     device.

       <b>number</b>        The dialstring to use to call the destination device.

       <b>page</b>          a string with PIN and to use in processing a page transmit request.

       <b>pagechop</b>      Whether or  not  to  automatically  truncate  trailing  whitespace  on  pages  of  outbound
                     facsimile;  see <b>PageChop</b> in <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-config.5.html">hylafax-config</a></u>(5).  The possible values are: ``<u>default</u>'' to use
                     the setting of the <b>PageChop</b> configuration parameter, ``<u>none</u>''  to  disable  page  chopping,
                     ``<u>all</u>''  to  enable chopping of all pages, and ``<u>last</u>'' to enable chopping of the last page
                     of each document.

       <b>pagehandling</b>  A string that contains per-page information used during facsimile  transmission.   Most  of
                     the  information  is  used  in  the  negotiation  of  session  capabilities  with  optional
                     information used in the implementation of page chopping.  The string has three  characters,
                     say  <u>xxc</u>,  for  each  page  to  be  transmitted.   The  <u>xx</u>  characters  are  a  hex-encoded
                     specification of the session capabilities required to transmit the page.  The  <u>c</u>  character
                     is  one  of ``M'', ``S'', and ``P''; where: ``M'' indicates there is another page to follow
                     and that the page requires different T.30 session parameters be negotiated (an EOM code  is
                     to be transmitted).  ``S'' indicates there is another page to follow, but the page uses the
                     same  session parameters (an MPS.  code is to be transmitted).  ``P'' indicates this is the
                     last page to be transmitted (an EOP code is to  be  transmitted).   In  addition,  if  page
                     chopping  has  been  enabled and the page has enough trailing whitespace to be a candidate,
                     then each three character string will be followed by a string of the form ``<u>ZXXXX</u>'',  where
                     ``XXXX''  is  a  4  digit  hex-encoded  count  of the number of bytes of data to send for a
                     chopped page.

       <b>pagelength</b>    The desired page length in millimeters.

       <b>pagewidth</b>     The desired page width in millimeters.

       <b>pcl</b>           The pathname of a PCL document to send.  Once a PCL document has been processed by <u>faxsend</u>,
                     it is marked as <b>!pcl</b> so that subsequent retries do not reprocess the document.

       <b>poll</b>          The value is a Caller Identification String (CIS) to use in making a polling  request.   If
                     no CIS is specified then <u>faxsend</u> will form one from the <b>FAXNumber</b> configuration parameter.

       <b>postscript</b>    The  pathname  of  a  POSTSCRIPT®  document  to  send.  Once a POSTSCRIPT document has been
                     processed by <u>faxsend</u>, it is marked  as  <b>!postscript</b>  so  that  subsequent  retries  do  not
                     reprocess the document.

       <b>receiver</b>      The receiver's name.  This value is used only when creating continuation cover pages.

       <b>resolution</b>    The desired vertical resolution in lines per inch.  This value should be either 98 or 196.

       retrytime     The time, in seconds, to delay between each attempt to transmit a job that fails because of
                     a communication-oriented problem.  Normally jobs are scheduled according to a collection of
                     configuration  parameters  that are tuned for the specific reason of each failure; e.g. see
                     <b>JobReqProto</b> in <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-config.5.html">hylafax-config</a></u>(5).

       returned      Used internally to determine the last return value of the send command issued for this job.

       <b>sender</b>        The ``full name'' of the sender of the facsimile.

       <b>signalrate</b>    The signalling rate used to transmit facsimile data.  This item is recorded  by  <u><a href="../man8/faxsend.8.html">faxsend</a></u>(8)
                     so that <u><a href="../man8/notify.8.html">notify</a></u>(8) can return it in a notification message.

       <b>state</b>         The  job  scheduling  state.   Recognized values are: 1 (<u>suspended</u>, not being scheduled), 2
                     (<u>pending</u>, waiting for the time to send), 3 (<u>sleeping</u>, waiting for a scheduled  timeout),  4
                     (<u>blocked</u>,  waiting  for concurrent activity to the same destination to complete), 5 (<u>ready</u>,
                     ready to be processed except for available resources), 6 (<u>active</u>, actively being  processed
                     by  <u>HylaFAX</u>), 7 (<u>done</u>, processing completed with success).  8 (<u>failed</u>, processing completed
                     with a failure).

       <b>status</b>        Status information about the current state of the job.  Typically this is  the  reason  why
                     the last attempt to send the facsimile failed.

       <b>subaddr</b>       The  SubAddress  information  to  transmit when sending a facsimile.  This string should be
                     used by the receiver to route received facsimile documents.

       <b>tagline</b>       The format string to use in  imaging  taglines  on  outgoing  documents.   Note  that  this
                     parameter is only used if the <b>desiredtl</b> parameter is non-zero.

       <b>tiff</b>          The  pathname  of  a  TIFF/F  document to send.  Once a TIFF document has been processed by
                     <u>faxsend</u>, it is marked as <b>!tiff</b> so that subsequent retries do not reprocess the document.

       <b>totdials</b>      The total number of times the server has placed a call to the receiving phone number.

       <b>totpages</b>      The total number of pages to be transmitted.

       <b>tottries</b>      The total number of attempts to transmit a job; see <b>maxtries</b> above.

       <b>tts</b>           The time to send the job.  If this value  is  non-zero,  it  is  number  of  seconds  since
                     00:00:00  GMT,  January 1, 1970.  Otherwise, a value of 0 is interpreted to mean process as
                     soon as possible.

       <b>useccover</b>     1 if the job should use a continuation cover page during retransmission, 0 otherwise.

       <b>usexvres</b>      1 if the job should use  the  highest  possible  vertical  resolution,  0  otherwise.   See
                     <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-server.5.html">hylafax-server</a></u>(5) for a description of continuation cover pages.
