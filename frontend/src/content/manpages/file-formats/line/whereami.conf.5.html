</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       whereami.conf — configuration file for <b>whereami</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>whereami.conf</b>  file  specifies  what  <b>whereami</b>      does  on  leaving,  remaining  at or arriving at
       locations.

       (Locations are detected by <b>whereami</b> according to specifications in the <b>detect.conf</b> file.)

       Comments are lines starting with the  `#'  character.   Leading  whitespace  is  ignored  on  all  lines,
       including comment lines.

       Other lines are of the form:

       <b>-</b><u>location</u> <u>action</u>
                 The  action  is performed if your system was previously at this location, but is now at another
                 location.

       <b>=</b><u>location</u> <u>action</u>
                 The action is performed if your system is now at this location.

       <b>+</b><u>location</u> <u>action</u>
                 The action is performed if your system is now at this location, but was previously  at  another
                 location.

       <b>!</b><u>location</u> <u>action</u>
                 The action is performed if your system is not at this location.

</pre><h4><b>HELPER</b> <b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
       In  addition  to  the  normal  commands  available within any shell script, <b>whereami</b> includes a number of
       helper scripts which may be useful.

       setmailrelay <u>(none</u> <u>|</u> <u>queue</u> <u>[smarthost]</u> <u>|</u> <u>smarthost)</u>
                 Set the mail relay (i.e. smarthost) to "none" if you have a permanent connection, and can  send
                 e-mail directly to the recipient's mailserver.

                 If you are not connected, set the relay to "queue" (optionally for a specific smarthost).

                 Or send all mail to a specific smarthost, if that is what you need in this location.

       setresolver <u>&lt;resolv.conf</u> <u>stanza&gt;</u>
                 The  <u>&lt;resolv.conf</u>  <u>stanza&gt;</u>  should  be something like: <u>search</u> <u>localhost</u> <u>mydomain.com</u> <u>nameserver</u>
                 <u>1.2.3.4</u> (all on one line) to specify the domain search path and the nameserver to use.

                 If you have <b>resolvconf</b> installed, this script  will  interface  with  that  to  manupulate  the
                 <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> file and control DNS resolution.  This is recommended.

                 If  you  are  not using resolvconf, then this will directly rewrite your <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> file,
                 inserting a section similar to the manner in which DHCP works.

       setproxy <u>(start</u> <u>|</u> <u>stop</u> <u>|</u> <u>none</u> <u>|</u> <u>&lt;upstream_proxy&gt;)</u>
                 Use this script to reconfigure your local  <b>oops</b>            or  <b>squid</b>  proxy  server  to  use  a
                 specific upstream proxy, no upstream proxy, or to stop the proxy server completely.

                 The  upstream  proxy  should be specified as "&lt;name or ip&gt; &lt;port&gt;", e.g.: <b>setproxy</b> <b>192.168.55.3</b>
                 <b>3128</b>

                 For a local <b>squid</b> proxy you can optionally also provide a complete set of  parameters  for  the
                 "cache_peer"  directive  (without  the  "cache_peer" name itself).  See the squid.conf file for
                 full details of this syntax.  e.g.: <b>setproxy</b> <b>192.168.55.3</b> <b>parent</b> <b>3128</b> <b>3140</b> <b>login=user:password</b>

       settimezone <u>timezone</u>
                 Use this to set your timezone differently.

       masqmail_route <u>route_name</u>
                 Use this to reconfigure <b>masqmail</b> to use a different masqmail routing.

       <b>/etc/whereami/whereiam.sh</b>
                 The script that is built based on the information in this configuration file and then  executed

       There should be a configuration program so that the user does not have to do any script programming.
