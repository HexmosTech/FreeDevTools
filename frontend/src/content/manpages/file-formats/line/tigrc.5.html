</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tigrc - Tig configuration file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>set</b>   <u>variable</u> <b>=</b> <u>value</u>
       <b>bind</b>  <u>keymap</u> <u>key</u> <u>action</u>
       <b>color</b> <u>area</u> <u>fgcolor</u> <u>bgcolor</u> <u>[attributes]</u>
       <b>source</b> <u>path</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You can permanently set an option by putting it in the <a href="file:~/.tigrc">~/.tigrc</a> file. The file consists of a series of
       <u>commands</u>. Each line of the file may contain only one command. Commands can span multiple lines if each
       line is terminated by a backslash (<u>\</u>) character.

       The hash mark (<u>#</u>) is used as a <u>comment</u> character. All text after the comment character to the end of the
       line is ignored. You can use comments to annotate your initialization file.

       Certain options can be manipulated at runtime via the option menu. In addition, options can also be
       toggled with the :toggle prompt command or by entering the configuration command into the prompt.

       In some environments, a user’s configuration will be stored in the alternate location
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tig/config. For brevity, this document will refer only to <a href="file:~/.tigrc.">~/.tigrc.</a>

</pre><h4><b>GIT</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Alternatively to using <a href="file:~/.tigrc">~/.tigrc</a>, Tig options can be set by putting them in one of the Git configuration
       files, which are read by Tig on startup. See <u><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a>(1)</u> for which files to use. The following example
       show the basic syntax to use for settings, bindings and colors.

           [tig] show-changes = true
           [tig "color"] cursor = yellow red bold
           [tig "bind"] generic = P parent

       In addition to tig-specific options, the following Git options are read from the Git configuration:

       <u>color.*</u>
           Colors for the various UI types. Can be configured via the <u>git-colors</u> setting.

       <u>core.abbrev</u>
           The width of the commit ID. See also <u>id-width</u> option.

       <u>core.editor</u>
           The editor command. Can be overridden by setting TIG_EDITOR or GIT_EDITOR.

       <u>core.worktree</u>
           The path to the root of the working tree.

       <u>gui.encoding</u>
           The encoding to use for displaying of file content.

       <u>i18n.commitencoding</u>
           The encoding used for commits. The default is UTF-8.

</pre><h4><b>SET</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       A few selective variables can be configured via the set command. The syntax is:

           <b>set</b> variables <b>=</b> value

       Examples:

           set commit-order = topo         # Order commits topologically
           set git-colors = no             # Do not read Git's color settings.
           set horizontal-scroll = 33%     # Scroll 33% of the view width
           set blame-options = -C -C -C    # Blame lines from other files

           # Wrap branch names with () and tags with &lt;&gt;
           set reference-format = (branch) &lt;tag&gt;

           # Configure blame view columns using command spanning multiple lines.
           set blame-view = \
                   date:default \
                   author:abbreviated \
                   file-name:auto \
                   id:yes,color \
                   line-number:yes,interval=5 text

       Or in the Git configuration files:

           [tig]
                   line-graphics = no      # Disable graphics characters
                   tab-size = 8            # Number of spaces per tab

       The type of variables is either bool, int, string, or mixed.

       Valid bool values
           To set a bool variable to true use either "1", "true", or "yes". Any other value will set the
           variable to false.

       Valid int values
           A non-negative integer.

       Valid string values
           A string of characters. Optionally, use either ' or " as delimiters.

       Valid mixed values
           These values are composites of the above types. The valid values are specified in the description.

   <b>Variables</b>
       The following variables can be set:

       <u>diff-options</u> (string)
           A space-separated string of diff options to use in the diff view. <a href="../man1/git-show.1.html">git-show</a>(1) is used for formatting
           and always passes --patch-with-stat. Can control display of commit header metadata, passing option
           --format. This option overrides any options specified in the TIG_DIFF_OPTS environment variable
           (described in <b><a href="../man1/tig.1.html">tig</a></b>(1)), but is itself overridden by diff flags given on the command line invocation.

       <u>blame-options</u> (string)
           A space-separated string of default blame options. Can be used for telling <a href="../man1/git-blame.1.html">git-blame</a>(1) how to detect
           the origin of lines. The options are ignored when Tig is started in blame mode and given blame
           options on the command line.

       <u>log-options</u> (string)
           A space-separated string of default options that should be passed to the <a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a>(1) command used by
           the log view. Options can be overridden by command line options. Used internally override custom
           ‘pretty.format’ settings that break the log view.

       <u>main-options</u> (string)
           A space-separated string of default options that should be passed to the <a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a>(1) command used by
           the main view. Options can be overridden by command line options.

       <u>reference-format</u> (string)
           A space-separated string of format strings used for formatting reference names. Wrap the name of the
           reference type with the characters you would like to use for formatting, e.g.  [tag] and &lt;remote&gt;. If
           no format is specified for local-tag, the format for tag is used. Similarly, if no format is
           specified for tracked-remote the remote format is used. Prefix with hide: to not show that reference
           type, e.g.  hide:remote. Supported reference types are:

           •   head : The current HEAD.

           •   tag : An annotated tag.

           •   local-tag : A lightweight tag.

           •   remote : A remote.

           •   tracked-remote : The remote tracked by current HEAD.

           •   replace : A replaced reference.

           •   branch : A branch.

           •   stash : The stash.

           •   other : Any other reference.

       <u>line-graphics</u> (mixed) [ascii|default|utf-8|auto|&lt;bool&gt;]
           What type of character graphics for line drawing. "auto" means "utf-8" if the locale is UTF-8,
           "default" otherwise.

       <u>truncation-delimiter</u> (mixed) [utf-8|&lt;string&gt;]
           A single character to draw where columns are truncated. The default is "~". The special value "utf-8"
           refers to the character "..." ("Midline Horizontal Ellipsis").

       <u>horizontal-scroll</u> (mixed)
           Interval to scroll horizontally in each step. Can be specified either as the number of columns, e.g.
           <u>5</u>, or as a percentage of the view width, e.g.  <u>33%</u>, where the maximum is 100%. For percentages it is
           always ensured that at least one column is scrolled. The default is to scroll <u>50%</u> of the view width.

       <u>git-colors</u> (list)
           A space-separated list of "key=value" pairs where the key is a Git color name and the value is a Tig
           color name, e.g. "branch.current=main-head" and "grep.filename=grep.file". Set to "no" to disable.

       <u>show-notes</u> (mixed) [&lt;reference&gt;|&lt;bool&gt;]
           Whether to show notes for a commit. When set to a note reference the reference is passed to git show
           --notes=. Notes are enabled by default.

       <u>show-changes</u> (bool)
           Whether to show staged and unstaged changes in the main view.

       <u>show-untracked</u> (bool)
           Whether to show also untracked changes in the main view.

       <u>vertical-split</u> (mixed) [auto|&lt;bool&gt;]
           Whether to split the view horizontally or vertically. "auto" (which is the default) means that it
           will depend on the window dimensions. When true vertical orientation is used, and false sets the
           orientation to horizontal.

       <u>split-view-height</u> (mixed)
           The height of the bottom view in a horizontally split display. Can be specified either as the number
           of rows, e.g.  <u>5</u>, or as a percentage of the view height, e.g.  <u>80%</u>, where the maximum is 100%. It is
           always ensured that the smaller of the views is at least four rows high. The default is <u>67%</u>.

       <u>split-view-width</u> (mixed)
           Width of the right-most view in a vertically split display. Can be specified either as the number of
           column, e.g.  <u>5</u>, or as a percentage of the view width, e.g.  <u>80%</u>, where the maximum is 100%. It is
           always ensured that the smaller of the views is at least four columns wide. The default is <u>50%</u>.

       <u>status-show-untracked-dirs</u> (bool)
           Show untracked directories contents in the status view (analog to git ls-files --directory option).
           On by default.

       <u>status-show-untracked-files</u> (bool)
           Show untracked files in the status view (mirrors Git’s status.showUntrackedFiles option). On by
           default.

       <u>tab-size</u> (int)
           Number of spaces per tab. The default is 8 spaces.

       <u>diff-context</u> (int)
           Number of context lines to show for diffs.

       <u>diff-highlight</u> (mixed)
           Whether to highlight diffs using Git’s <u>diff-highlight</u> program. Defaults to false. When set to true
           then <u>diff-highlight</u> is used, else the option value is used as the path. When this option is in
           effect, highlighted regions are governed by color diff-add-highlight and color diff-del-highlight.

       <u>ignore-space</u> (mixed) [no|all|some|at-eol|&lt;bool&gt;]
           Ignore space changes in diff view. By default no space changes are ignored. Changing this to "all",
           "some" or "at-eol" is equivalent to passing "--ignore-all-space", "--ignore-space" or
           "--ignore-space-at-eol" respectively to git diff or git show.

           <b>Warning:</b> when ignore-space is set to some, all or at-eol, then the <b>status-update</b> and <b>status-revert</b>
           may fail when updating or reverting chunks containing lines with space changes. Similarly,
           <b>stage-update-line</b> may fail when updating a line adjacent to a line with space changes

       <u>commit-order</u> (enum) [auto|default|topo|date|author-date|reverse]
           Commit ordering using the default (chronological reverse) order, topological order, date order or
           reverse order. When set to "auto" (which is the default), topological order is automatically used in
           the main view when the commit graph is enabled. In repositories with a long commit history it is
           advised to set this option to "default" to speed up loading of the main view.

       <u>ignore-case</u> (enum) [no|yes|smart-case]
           Ignore case in searches. "smart-case" ignores case if the search string doesn’t contain any uppercase
           letters. By default, the search is case sensitive.

       <u>mailmap</u> (bool)
           Read canonical name and email addresses for authors and committers from .mailmap. Off by default. See
           <a href="../man1/git-shortlog.1.html">git-shortlog</a>(1).

       <u>wrap-lines</u> (bool)
           Wrap long lines. By default, lines are not wrapped. Not compatible with line numbers enabled.

       <u>focus-child</u> (bool)
           Whether to focus the child view when it is opened. When disabled the focus will remain in the parent
           view, avoiding reloads of the child view when navigating the parent view. True by default.

       <u>send-child-enter</u> (bool)
           Whether to send "enter" key presses to the child view, even if parent view is active. When disabled
           the child view has to be explicitly focused to receive the "enter" key presses. In practice only
           relevant when set focus-child = no. True by default.

       <u>editor-line-number</u> (bool)
           Whether to pass the selected line number to the editor command. The line number is passed as
           +&lt;line-number&gt; in front of the file name. Example: vim +10 tig.c

       <u>history-size</u> (int)
           Size of the persistent <a href="file:~/.tig_history">~/.tig_history</a> file when compiled with readline support. Default is 500. Set
           to 0 to disable.

       <u>mouse</u> (bool)
           Whether to enable mouse support. Off by default since it makes selecting text from the terminal less
           intuitive. When enabled hold down Shift (or Option on Mac) to select text. Mouse support requires
           that ncurses itself support mouse events.

       <u>mouse-scroll</u> (int)
           Interval to scroll up or down using the mouse. The default is 3 lines. Mouse support requires that
           ncurses itself support mouse events and that you have enabled mouse support in <a href="file:~/.tigrc">~/.tigrc</a> with set
           mouse = true.

       <u>mouse-wheel-cursor</u> (bool)
           Whether to prefer moving the cursor to scrolling the view when using the mouse wheel. Off by default.
           Combines well with set mouse-scroll = 1. Mouse support requires that ncurses itself support mouse
           events and that you have enabled mouse support in <a href="file:~/.tigrc">~/.tigrc</a> with set mouse = true.

       <u>pager-autoscroll</u> (bool)
           Whether to scroll automatically the pager view while loading. Move the cursor out of the last line to
           stop scrolling and back in to resume.

       <u>pgrp</u> (bool)
           Make tig process-group leader when starting and clean all processes when exiting. Off by default. Do
           not enable this option if you are using a Zsh version affected by zsh-workers/43379. Run xclip with
           setsid to keep clipboard content after exiting tig. If you are using git-credential-cache helper, set
           option credentialCache.ignoreSIGHUP.

       <u>start-on-head</u> (bool)
           Start with cursor on HEAD commit.

       <u>refresh-mode</u> (mixed) [manual|auto|after-command|periodic|&lt;bool&gt;]
           Configures how views are refreshed based on modifications to watched files in the repository. When
           set to <u>manual</u>, nothing is refreshed automatically. When set to <u>auto</u>, views are refreshed when a
           modification is detected in another view. When set to <u>after-command</u> only refresh after returning from
           an external command. When set to <u>periodic</u>, visible views are refreshed periodically using
           <u>refresh-interval</u>.

       <u>refresh-interval</u> (int)
           Interval in seconds between view refresh update checks when <u>refresh-mode</u> is set to <u>periodic</u>.

       <u>file-args</u> (args)
           Command line arguments referring to files. These are filtered using <a href="../man1/git-rev-parse.1.html">git-rev-parse</a>(1).

       <u>rev-args</u> (args)
           Command line arguments referring to revisions. These are filtered using <a href="../man1/git-rev-parse.1.html">git-rev-parse</a>(1).

   <b>View</b> <b>settings</b>
       The view settings define the order and options for the different columns of a view. Each view setting
       expects a space-separated list of column specifications. Column specifications starts with the column
       type, and can optionally be followed by a colon (:) and a list of column options. E.g. the following
       column specification defines an <u>author</u> column displaying the author email and with a fixed width of 20
       characters: author:email,width=20.

       The first option value in a column specification is always the <u>display</u> option. When no <u>display</u> value is
       given, <u>yes</u> is assumed. For <u>display</u> options expecting an enumerated value this will automatically resolve
       to the default enum value. For example, file-name will automatically have its <u>display</u> setting resolve to
       <u>auto</u>.

       Specifications can also be given for a single column, for example to override the defaults in the system
       tigrc file. To override a single column, use the column name as a suffix after the view setting name,
       e.g. main-view-date will allow to set the date in the main view.

       Examples:

           # Enable both ID and line numbers in the blame view
           set blame-view = date:default author:full file-name:auto id:yes,color \
                            line-number:yes,interval=5 text

           # Change grep view to be similar to `git grep` format
           set grep-view = file-name:yes line-number:yes,interval=1 text

           # Show file sizes as units
           set tree-view = line-number:no,interval=5 mode author:full \
                           file-size:units date:default id:no file-name

           # Show line numbers for every 10th line in the pager view
           set pager-view = line-number:yes,interval=10 text

           # Shorthands to change view settings for a previously defined column
           set main-view-date = custom
           set main-view-date-format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"
           set blame-view-line-number = no
           # Use Git's default commit order, even when the commit graph is enabled.
           set commit-order = default

       The following list shows which the available view settings and what column types they support:

       blob-view, diff-view, log-view, pager-view, stage-view
           line-number, text

       blame-view
           author, date, file-name, id, line-number, text

       grep-view
           file-name, line-number, text

       main-view, reflog-view
           author, date, commit-title, id, line-number, ref

       refs-view
           author, date, commit-title, id, line-number, ref

       stash-view
           author, date, commit-title, id, line-number

       status-view
           file-name, line-number, status

       tree-view
           author, date, id, file-name, file-size, line-number, mode

       Supported column types and their respective column options:

       author

           •   <u>display</u> (mixed) [full|abbreviated|email|email-user|&lt;bool&gt;]: How to display author names. If set
               to "abbreviated" author initials will be shown.

           •   <u>width</u> (int): Fixed width for the column. When set to a value between 1 and 10, the author name
               will be abbreviated to the author’s initials. When set to zero, the width is automatically sized
               to fit the content.

           •   <u>maxwidth</u> (int): Maximum width of the column. Permit automatically sizing content, up to this
               limit. Can be specified either as the number of columns, e.g.  <u>15</u>, or as a percentage of the view
               width, e.g.  <u>20%</u>, where the maximum is 100%.

       commit-title

           •   <u>graph</u> (mixed) [no|v2|v1]: Whether to show the revision graph in the main view on start-up. "v1"
               refers to the old graph rendering, which is less accurate but faster and thus recommended in
               large repositories. See also the <u>line-graphics</u> options.

           •   <u>refs</u> (bool): Whether to show references (branches, tags, and remotes) in the main view. Can be
               toggled.

           •   <u>overflow</u> (bool or int): Whether to highlight text in commit titles exceeding a given width. When
               set to a boolean, it enables or disables the highlighting using the default width of 50
               character. When set to an int, the assigned value is used as the maximum character width.

       date

           •   <u>display</u> (mixed) [relative|relative-compact|custom|default|&lt;bool&gt;]: How to display dates. If set
               to "relative" or "relative-compact" a relative date will be used, e.g. "2 minutes ago" or "2m".
               If set to "custom", the <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3) string format specified in the "format" option is used.

           •   <u>local</u> (bool): If true, use <a href="../man3/localtime.3.html">localtime</a>(3) to convert to local timezone. Note that relative dates
               always use local offsets.

           •   <u>format</u> (string): format string to pass to <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3) when <u>custom</u> display mode has been selected.

           •   <u>width</u> (int): Fixed width for the column. When set to zero, the width is automatically sized to
               fit the content.

       file-name

           •   <u>display</u> (mixed) [auto|always|&lt;bool&gt;]: When to display file names. If set to "auto" file names are
               shown only when needed, e.g. when running: tig blame -C &lt;file&gt;.

           •   <u>width</u> (int): Width of the column. When set to zero, the width is automatically sized to fit the
               content.

           •   <u>maxwidth</u> (int): Maximum width of the column. Permit automatically sizing content, up to this
               limit. Can be specified either as the number of columns, e.g.  <u>15</u>, or as a percentage of the view
               width, e.g.  <u>20%</u>, where the maximum is 100%.

       file-size

           •   <u>display</u> (mixed) [default|units|&lt;bool&gt;]: How to display file sizes. When set to "units", sizes are
               shown using binary prefixes, e.g. 12524 bytes is shown as "12.2K".

           •   <u>width</u> (int): Fixed width for the filename column. When set to zero, the width is automatically
               sized to fit the content.

       id

           •   <u>display</u> (bool): Whether to show commit IDs in the main view.

           •   <u>width</u> (int) : Fixed width for the commit ID column. When unset Tig will use the value of
               <u>core.abbrev</u> if found. See <a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a>(1) on how to set <u>core.abbrev</u>. When set to zero the width is
               automatically sized to fit the content of reflog (e.g.  ref/stash@{4}) IDs and otherwise default
               to 7.

       line-number

           •   <u>display</u> (bool): Whether to show line numbers.

           •   <u>interval</u> (int): Interval between line numbers.

           •   <u>width</u> (int): Fixed width for the column. When set to zero, the width is automatically sized to
               fit the content.

       mode

           •   <u>display</u> (bool): Whether to show file modes.

           •   <u>width</u> (int): Fixed width for the column. When set to zero, the width is automatically sized to
               fit the content.

       ref

           •   <u>display</u> (bool): Whether to show the reference name.

           •   <u>width</u> (int): Fixed width for the column. When set to zero, the width is automatically sized to
               fit the content.

           •   <u>maxwidth</u> (int): Maximum width of the column. Permit automatically sizing content, up to this
               limit. Can be specified either as the number of columns, e.g.  <u>15</u>, or as a percentage of the view
               width, e.g.  <u>20%</u>, where the maximum is 100%.

       status

           •   <u>display</u> (mixed) [no|short|long|&lt;bool&gt;]: How to display the status label.

       text

           •   <u>commit-title-overflow</u> (bool or int): Whether to highlight commit titles exceeding a given width
               in the diff view. When set to a boolean, it enables or disables the highlighting using the
               default width of 50 character. When set to an int, the assigned value is used as the maximum
               character width.

       All column options can be toggled. For <u>display</u> options, use the option name as the prefix followed by a
       dash and the column name. E.g. :toggle author-display will toggle the <u>display</u> option in the <u>author</u>
       column. For all other options use the column name followed by a dash and then the option name as the
       suffix. E.g. :toggle commit-title-graph will toggle the <u>graph</u> option in the <u>commit-title</u> column.
       Alternatively, use the option menu to manipulate options.

</pre><h4><b>BIND</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       Using bind commands, keys can be mapped to an action when pressed in a given key map. The syntax is:

           <b>bind</b> <u>keymap</u> <u>key</u> <u>action</u>

       Examples:

           # Add keybinding to quickly jump to the next diff chunk in the stage view
           bind stage &lt;Enter&gt; :/^@@

           # Disable the default mapping for running git-gc
           bind generic G none

           # User-defined external command to amend the last commit
           bind status + !git commit --amend

           # User-defined internal command that reloads <a href="file:~/.tigrc">~/.tigrc</a>
           bind generic S :source <a href="file:~/.tigrc">~/.tigrc</a>

           # UTF8-encoded characters can be used as key values.
           bind generic ø @sh -c "printf '%s' %(commit) | pbcopy"

       Or in the Git configuration files:

           [tig "bind"]
                   # 'unbind' the default quit key binding
                   main = Q none
                   # Cherry-pick current commit onto current branch
                   generic = C !git cherry-pick %(commit)

       Keys are mapped by first searching the keybindings for the current view, then the keybindings for the
       <b>generic</b> keymap, and last the default keybindings. Thus, the view keybindings override the generic
       keybindings which override the built-in keybindings.

       Keybindings at the line-entry prompt are typically governed by the readline library, and are configured
       separately in <a href="file:~/.inputrc.">~/.inputrc.</a> See <u><a href="../man1/readline.1.html">readline</a>(1)</u>. Tig respects but does not require an $if tig section in
       <a href="file:~/.inputrc.">~/.inputrc.</a>

       Keymaps
           Valid keymaps are: <b>main</b>, <b>diff</b>, <b>log</b>, <b>reflog</b>, <b>help</b>, <b>pager</b>, <b>status</b>, <b>stage</b>, <b>tree</b>, <b>blob</b>, <b>blame</b>, <b>refs</b>,
           <b>stash</b>, <b>grep</b> and <b>generic</b>. Use <b>generic</b> to set key mapping in all keymaps (which may still be overridden
           by a specific view keybinding). Use <b>search</b> to define keys for navigating search results during
           search.

       Key values
           Key values should never be quoted. Use either an ASCII or UTF8-encoded character or one of the
           following symbolic key names. Symbolic key names are case insensitive and starts with "&lt;" and ends
           with "&gt;". Use <b>&lt;Hash&gt;</b> to bind to the # key, since the hash mark is used as a comment character. Use
           <b>&lt;LessThan&gt;</b> to bind to the &lt; key.

       <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;Space&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;Backspace&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;Tab&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;Escape&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;Esc&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;Left&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;Right&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;Up&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;Down&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;Insert&gt;</b> or
       <b>&lt;Ins&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;Delete&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;Del&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;Hash&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;LessThan&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;LT&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;Home&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;End&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;PageUp&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;PgUp&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;PageDown&gt;</b> or
       <b>&lt;PgDown&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;ScrollBack&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;SBack&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;ScrollFwd&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;SFwd&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;ShiftTab&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;BackTab&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;ShiftLeft&gt;</b>,
       <b>&lt;ShiftRight&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;ShiftDelete&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;ShiftDel&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;ShiftHome&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;ShiftEnd&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;SingleQuote&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;DoubleQuote&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;F1&gt;</b>
       ... <b>&lt;F19&gt;</b>

       To define key mappings with the Ctrl key, use &lt;Ctrl-key&gt;. In addition, key combos consisting of an
       initial Escape key followed by a normal key value can be bound using &lt;Esc&gt;key.

       Examples:

           bind main R             refresh
           bind main &lt;Down&gt;        next
           bind main &lt;Ctrl-f&gt;      scroll-page-down
           bind main &lt;Esc&gt;o        options
           bind main &lt;ShiftTab&gt;    parent

       Notes

       •   Tig reads keystrokes via ncurses and is subject to various limitations. See <u><a href="../man3x/ncurses.3x.html">ncurses</a>(3x)</u> and
           <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a>(5)</u> (or termcap).

       •   Ctrl-m and Ctrl-i cannot be bound as they conflict with <u>Enter</u> and <u>Tab</u> respectively.

       •   Case differences cannot be distinguished in control sequences such as Ctrl-f and Ctrl-F.

       •   Ctrl-&lt;Space&gt; is typically translated to Ctrl-@, which is available for binding.

       •   Only some subset of special symbolic keys such as &lt;ShiftTab&gt; will be available in any given terminal
           emulator.

       •   Ctrl-z is automatically used for process control and will suspend Tig and open a subshell (use fg to
           reenter Tig).

           Actions
               Actions are either specified as user-defined commands (external or internal) or using action
               names as described in the following sections.

   <b>External</b> <b>user-defined</b> <b>command</b>
       These actions start with one or more of the following option flags followed by the command that should be
       executed.

       !   Run the command in the foreground
           with output shown.

       @   Run the command in the background
           with no output.

       +   Run the command synchronously, and
           echo the first line of output to the
           status bar.

       ?   Prompt the user before executing the
           command.

       &lt;   Exit Tig after executing the command.

       &gt;   Re-open Tig instantly in the last
           displayed view after executing the
           command.

       Unless otherwise specified, commands are run in the foreground with their console output shown (as if <u>!</u>
       was specified). When multiple command options are specified their behavior are combined, e.g. "?&lt;git
       commit" will prompt the user whether to execute the command and will exit Tig after completion.

       Note that if you want to use pipes or redirection in your commands then you must run them in a subshell,
       i.e. embed your commands in sh -c '&lt;commands&gt;'.

       <b>Browsing</b> <b>state</b> <b>variables</b>

           %(repo:worktree)              The worktree path, if defined.

           %(repo:is-inside-work-tree)   Whether Tig is running inside a work
                                         tree, either true or false.

           Examples:

               # Save the current commit as a patch file when the user selects a commit
               # in the main view and presses 'S'.
               bind main S !git format-patch -1 %(commit)

               # Create and checkout a new branch; specify custom prompt
               bind main B ?git checkout -b "%(prompt Enter new branch name: )"

               # Show commit statistics for the author under the cursor
               bind main U +sh -c 'git --no-pager shortlog -s --author="$(git show -s --format=%aE %(commit))" &lt;/dev/tty'

       <b>Advanced</b> <b>shell-like</b> <b>commands</b>

           If your command requires use of dynamic features, such as subshells, expansion of environment
           variables and process control, this can be achieved by using a shell command:

           <b>Example</b> <b>1.</b> <b>Configure</b> <b>a</b> <b>binding</b> <b>to</b> <b>copy</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>commit</b> <b>ID</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>clipboard.</b>

               bind generic I @sh -c "echo -n %(commit) | xclip -selection c"

           Or by using a combination of Git aliases and Tig external commands. The following example entries can
           be put in either the .gitconfig or .git/config file:

           <b>Example</b> <b>2.</b> <b>Git</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>which</b> <b>binds</b> <b>Tig</b> <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> <b>Git</b> <b>command</b> <b>aliases.</b>

               [alias]
                       gitk-bg = !"gitk HEAD --not $(git rev-parse --remotes) &amp;"
                       publish = !"for i in origin public; do git push $i; done"
               [tig "bind"]
                       generic = V @git gitk-bg
                       generic = &gt; !git publish

   <b>Internal</b> <b>user-defined</b> <b>commands</b>
       Actions beginning with a <u>:</u> will be run and interpreted as internal commands and act similar to commands
       run via Tig’s prompt. Valid internal commands are configuration file options (as described in this
       document) and pager view commands. Examples:

           # Reload <a href="file:~/.tigrc">~/.tigrc</a> when 'S' is pressed
           bind generic S :source .tigrc

           # Change diff view to show all commit changes regardless of file limitations
           bind diff F :set diff-options = --full-diff

           # Show the output of <a href="../man1/git-reflog.1.html">git-reflog</a>(1) in the pager view
           bind generic W :!git reflog

           # Search for previous diff (c)hunk and next diff header
           bind stage 2 :?^@@
           bind stage D :/^diff --(git|cc)

           bind main I :toggle id                          # Show/hide the ID column
           bind diff D :toggle diff-options --minimal      # Use minimal diff algorithm

       before the command is run.

   <b>Action</b> <b>names</b>
       Valid action names are described below. Note, all action names are case-insensitive, and you may use <u>-</u>,
       <b>_</b>, and <u>.</u> interchangeably, e.g. "view-main", "View.Main", and "VIEW_MAIN" are the same.

</pre><h4><b>COLOR</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       Color commands control highlighting and the user interface styles. If your terminal supports color, these
       commands can be used to assign foreground and background combinations to certain areas. Optionally, an
       attribute can be given as the last parameter. The syntax is:

           <b>color</b> <u>area</u> <u>fgcolor</u> <u>bgcolor</u> <u>[attributes]</u>

       Examples:

           # Override the default terminal colors to white on black.
           color default           white   black
           # Diff colors
           color diff-header       yellow  default
           color diff-index        blue    default
           color diff-chunk        magenta default
           color "Reported-by:"    green   default
           # View-specific color
           color tree.date         black   cyan    bold
           # Custom color
           color "/(note|warning|error):/" yellow  default bold

       Or in the Git configuration files:

           [tig "color"]
                   # A strange looking cursor line
                   cursor          = red   default underline
                   # UI colors
                   title-blur      = white blue
                   title-focus     = white blue    bold
           # View-specific color
           [tig "color.tree"]
                   date            = cyan  default bold

       Area names
           Can be either a built-in area name or a custom quoted string. The latter allows custom color rules to
           be added for lines matching a quoted string. Strings of the form "/.../" are interpreted as regular
           expressions. Valid built-in area names are described below. Note, all names are case-insensitive, and
           you may use <u>-</u>, and <b>_</b> interchangeably, e.g. "Diff-Header" and "DIFF_HEADER" are the same.
           View-specific colors can be defined by prefixing the view name to the area name, e.g.
           "stage.diff-chunk" and "diff.diff-chunk".

       Color names
           Valid colors include: <b>white</b>, <b>black</b>, <b>green</b>, <b>magenta</b>, <b>blue</b>, <b>cyan</b>, <b>yellow</b>, <b>red</b>, <b>default</b>. Use <b>default</b> to
           refer to the default terminal colors, for example, to keep the background transparent when you are
           using a terminal with a transparent background.

           Colors can also be specified using the keywords <b>color0</b>, <b>color1</b>, ..., <b>colorN-1</b> (where <b>N</b> is the number
           of colors supported by your terminal). This is useful when you remap the colors for your display or
           want to enable colors supported by 88-color and 256-color terminals. Note that the <u>color</u> prefix is
           optional. If you prefer, you can specify colors directly by their numbers <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, ..., <b>N-1</b> instead,
           just like in the configuration file of Git.

       Attribute names
           Valid attributes include: <b>normal</b>, <b>blink</b>, <b>bold</b>, <b>dim</b>, <b>reverse</b>, <b>standout</b>, and <b>underline</b>. Note, not all
           attributes may be supported by the terminal.

   <b>UI</b> <b>colors</b>
       The colors and attributes to be used for the text that is not highlighted or that specify the use of the
       default terminal colors can be controlled by setting the <b>default</b> color option.

       <b>Table</b> <b>1.</b> <b>General</b>

                       the status view. Use <u>help.header</u> to

                        ASCII colors, where the second half
                        of them have the bold attribute

</pre><h4><b>SOURCE</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       Source commands make it possible to read additional configuration files. Sourced files are included
       in-place, meaning when a <u>source</u> command is encountered the file will be immediately read. Any commands
       later in the current configuration file will take precedence.

       If the given path does not exist, tig will proceed with a warning. Give the -q parameter to suppress the
       warning.

       The syntax is:

           <b>source</b> <u>[-q]</u> <u>path</u>

       Examples:

           source <a href="file:~/.tig/colorscheme.tigrc">~/.tig/colorscheme.tigrc</a>
           source <a href="file:~/.tig/keybindings.tigrc">~/.tig/keybindings.tigrc</a>
