</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       log/* - session log files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Files  in  the  <b>log</b>  directory  in  the  <u>HylaFAX</u>  spooling area contain logging/tracing information about
       transmit and receive sessions.  One file exists for each inbound or outbound call, with the  filename  of
       the  form  ``cXXXXXXXX''  where  XXXXXXXX is a decimal sequence number termed a <u>communication</u> <u>identifier</u>.
       The amount and kind of tracing information that is recorded for a call is defined by  the  <b>SessionTracing</b>
       parameter specified in the modem configuration file; see <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-config.5.html">hylafax-config</a></u>(5).

       Note  that  logging/tracing  information  generated by the server outside of a session is directed to the
       <u><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></u>(3) service and is controlled by the <b>LogFacility</b> and  <b>ServerTracing</b>  parameters  specified  in  the
       modem configuration file.

       [<b>NB:</b> <b>The</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>manual</b> <b>page</b> <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>date.</b>]

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       The following messages may appear when server operation tracing (bit 1) is enabled:

       <b>MODEM:</b> <b>Unknown</b> <b>type</b> <b>"%s"</b> <b>ignored</b>.  The <b>ModemType</b> configuration parameter was not recognized.

       <b>MODEM</b> <b>%s</b> <b>%s/%s</b>.  This message is generated each time the modem is reset and made ready for use.

       <b>%s:</b>  <b>Can</b>  <b>not</b> <b>lock</b> <b>device.</b>.  The UUCP lockfile for the modem could not be created because another process
       has a lockfile already in place.

       <b>%s:</b> <b>Can</b> <b>not</b> <b>open</b> <b>modem</b> <b>(%m)</b>.  <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) on the special device file for the modem failed; the  error  status
       is presented; c.f.  <u><a href="../man2/intro.2.html">intro</a></u>(2).

       <b>%s:</b> <b>Can</b> <b>not</b> <b>open</b> <b>modem</b> <b>(timed</b> <b>out).</b>.  <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) on the special device file blocked and was timed out.  This
       typically  is because the system does not support a non-blocking mechanism for opening the device and the
       presented interface requires that carrier be present before the open can succeed.

       <b>%s:</b> <b>setuid</b> <b>root</b> <b>failed</b> <b>(%m)</b>.  The server process was  unable  to  establish  root  privileges.   This  is
       usually caused by server being improperly installed.

       <b>%s:</b>  <b>fcntl:</b>  <b>%m</b>.   The  server  was unable to turn off the O_NDELAY bit on the open modem file descriptor
       after doing a non-blocking open of the modem device special file.

       <b>schedctl:</b> <b>%m</b>.  (<u>Only</u> <u>on</u> <u>Silicon</u> <u>Graphics</u> <u>systems.</u>)  A <u><a href="../man2/schedctl.2.html">schedctl</a></u>(2) system call to set the  server  process
       priority failed.

       <b>sched</b>  <b>policy=%d,</b>  <b>priority=%d</b>.   (<u>Only</u>  <u>on</u> <u>POSIX</u> <u>compliant</u> <u>systems.</u>)  Describes a <u><a href="../man2/setscheduler.2.html">setscheduler</a></u>(2) system
       call to enhance real-time job scheduling.

       <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>%s</b> <b>scheduling</b> <b>parameters:</b> <b>%m</b>.  (<u>Only</u> <u>on</u> <u>SVR4-style</u> <u>systems.</u>)  A <u>priocntl</u> system call to set
       the server process priority failed.

       <b>priocntl(%s):</b> <b>%m</b>.  (<u>Only</u> <u>on</u> <u>SVR4-style</u> <u>systems.</u>)  A <u>priocntl</u> system  call  to  get  the  current  process
       scheduling information failed.

       <b>sched</b>  <b>policy=%d,</b>  <b>priority=%d</b>.   (<u>Only</u>  <u>on</u> <u>POSIX-compliant</u> <u>systems.</u>)  Indicates a possible change in the
       system job scheduling due to use of <b>PriorityScheduling</b>

       <b>%s:</b> <b>Can</b> <b>not</b> <b>deduce</b> <b>modem</b> <b>type.</b>.  The server was unable to reset and initialize the modem.   This  can  be
       caused  by  many  things:  wrong device filename, improper cabling, incorrect modem type, incorrect modem
       configuration, etc.

       <b>RECV:</b> <b>Permission</b> <b>denied</b> <b>(unacceptable</b> <b>client</b> <b>TSI)</b>.  A receive request was denied because the  client  was
       denied access through the TSI access control list mechanism; c.f.  <u><a href="../man5/tsi.5.html">tsi</a></u>(5).

       <b>RECV:</b>  <b>Unable</b>  <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>file</b> <b>"%s"</b> <b>for</b> <b>received</b> <b>data</b>.  The server was unable to create a file for writing
       the received facsimile data.  Check the permission on the  <b>recvq</b>  subdirectory.   Beware  also  that  the
       server  uses  <u><a href="../man3/tempnam.3.html">tempnam</a></u>(3)  to  create  these files and the presence of the TMPDIR environment variable may
       cause the server to try to create files in a directory other than the <b>recvq</b> directory.

       <b>RECV</b> <b>data</b> <b>in</b> <b>"%s"</b>.  This is an information message;  the  received  facsimile  is  being  placed  in  the
       specified filename.

       <b>RECV:</b>  <b>empty</b>  <b>file</b>  <b>"%s"</b>  <b>deleted</b>.  A receive operation terminated without any good pages being received;
       consequently the empty file is deleted.

       <b>ACCEPT</b> <b>TSI</b> <b>"%s"</b>.  The TSI received during a receive operation was accepted and the receive will continue.

       <b>REJECT</b> <b>TSI</b> <b>"%s"</b>.  The TSI received during a receive operation  was  rejected  and  the  receive  will  be
       aborted at the next opportunity.

       <b>POLL:</b>  <b>Unable</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>create</b>  <b>file</b>  <b>"%s"</b>  <b>for</b> <b>received</b> <b>data</b>.  The server was unable to create a file for the
       polled data.  See also above under ``<b>RECV:</b> <b>Unable...</b>''.

       <b>POLL:</b> <b>empty</b> <b>file</b> <b>"%s"</b> <b>deleted</b>.  A poll operation  terminated  without  any  good  pages  being  received;
       consequently the empty file is deleted.

       <b>internal</b>  <b>muckup,</b>  <b>lost</b> <b>polling</b> <b>request</b>.  This message should not appear; it indicates the server went to
       do a poll but did not find the user-specified poll request in its job description; c.f.  <u><a href="../man5/sendq.5.html">sendq</a></u>(5).

       <b>SEND</b> <b>FAILED:</b> <b>%s</b>.  A transmission failed for the reason shown.

       <b>SEND:</b> <b>Can</b> <b>not</b> <b>open</b> <b>document</b> <b>file</b> <b>"%s",</b> <b>dirnum</b> <b>%d</b>.  The server was unable to open the TIFF  document  file
       that was to be transmitted.

       <b>SEND:</b>  <b>Can</b>  <b>not</b> <b>set</b> <b>directory</b> <b>in</b> <b>document</b> <b>file</b> <b>"%s",</b> <b>dirnum</b> <b>%d</b>.  The server was unable to access the TIFF
       directory associated with the next page to transmit.  The document file and directory number for the page
       are shown.

       <b>SEND:</b> <b>%s</b> <b>"%s",</b> <b>dirnum</b> <b>%d</b>.  A transmission failed because three attempts were made to  transmit  the  same
       page.  The full reason for the failure is displayed along with the document filename and directory number
       of the page that failed.

       <b>SEND:</b>  <b>Document</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>not</b>  <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  <b>Group</b>  <b>3-compatible</b> <b>format</b> <b>(file</b> <b>%s,</b> <b>compression</b> <b>%d)</b>.  The TIFF document
       submitted for transmission was not was not compressed with CCITT T.4 compression;  the  TIFF  compression
       code number is shown.  This is treated as a fatal error and the job is aborted.

       <b>REJECT:</b> <b>Document</b> <b>was</b> <b>encoded</b> <b>with</b> <b>2DMR,</b> <b>but</b> <b>client</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>this</b> <b>data</b> <b>format</b>.  The document to be
       transmitted  was  encoded  using  the  optional  2DMR  form  of  the  CCITT  T.4 standard, but the client
       capabilities indicate this data format is not supported.  This is not a  fatal  error;  the  server  will
       disconnect and reimage the document using 1DMH encoding.

       <b>REJECT:</b>  <b>Client</b>  <b>does</b>  <b>not</b>  <b>support</b>  <b>document</b> <b>page</b> <b>width,</b> <b>max</b> <b>remote</b> <b>page</b> <b>width</b> <b>%u,</b> <b>image</b> <b>width</b> <b>%lu</b>.  The
       document to be transmitted was imaged using a page width that is not supported by the  client.   This  is
       not  a fatal error; the server will disconnect and reimage the document using the newly discovered client
       capabilities.

       <b>REJECT:</b> <b>High</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>document</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>client,</b> <b>image</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>%g</b> <b>line/mm</b>.   The  document
       to  be  transmitted was imaged using 7 line/mm, but the client only supports 3.85 line/mm.  This is not a
       fatal error; the server will disconnect and reimage  the  document  using  the  newly  discovered  client
       capabilities.

       <b>REJECT:</b> <b>Client</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>document</b> <b>page</b> <b>length,</b> <b>max</b> <b>remote</b> <b>page</b> <b>length</b> <b>%d</b> <b>mm,</b> <b>image</b> <b>length</b> <b>%lu</b> <b>rows</b>
       <b>(%.2f</b>  <b>mm)</b>.   The  document to be transmitted was imaged using a page length that is not supported by the
       client.  This is not a fatal error; the server will disconnect and reimage the document using  the  newly
       discovered client capabilities.

       <b>ABORT:</b>  <b>job</b>  <b>abort</b>  <b>requested</b>.  The server received a request on a command FIFO file to abort the current
       send/receive job.

       <b>ANSWER:</b> <b>Can</b> <b>not</b> <b>lock</b> <b>modem</b> <b>device</b>.  The server went to answer an incoming  call,  but  found  the  device
       locked  for use by another process.  This is the usual scenario that takes place when an outbound call is
       made through the modem: the echo from data written to the modem causes the fax server to wakeup, only  to
       discover  the  UUCP  lockfile for the outgoing call.  The fax server will discard its handle on the modem
       and wait for the lockfile to be removed.

       <b>ANSWER:</b> <b>FAX</b> <b>CONNECTION</b>.  The server is initiating service for an incoming facsimile call.

       <b>ANSWER:</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>CONNECTION</b>.  The server is initiating service for an incoming data call.

       <b>ANSWER:</b> <b>Data</b> <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>permitted</b>.  The server  rejected  an  incoming  data  call  because  the
       configured <b>GettyArgs</b> parameter is null.

       <b>ANSWER:</b>  <b>Could</b>  <b>not</b>  <b>switch</b>  <b>modem</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>data</b>  <b>service</b>.   The server was unable to initiate service for an
       incoming data call because of some problem in setting up the modem for data use.

       <b>ANSWER:</b> <b>VOICE</b> <b>CONNECTION</b>.  The server is initiating service for an incoming voice call.

       <b>ANSWER:</b> <b>Could</b> <b>not</b> <b>switch</b> <b>modem</b> <b>to</b> <b>voice</b> <b>service</b>.  The server  was  unable  to  initiate  service  for  an
       incoming voice call because of some problem in setting up the modem for voice use.

       <b>ANSWER:</b> <b>%s</b>.  An error was detected by the modem layer while setting up an incoming call.

       <b>GETTY:</b>  <b>could</b>  <b>not</b>  <b>create</b>.   The  server was unable to create an internal data structure used to track a
       getty process.

       <b>GETTY:</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>fork</b>.  The server was unable to <u><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></u>(2) a new  process  in  order  to  startup  the  getty
       program.

       <b>runGetty::setregid:</b> <b>%m</b>.
       <b>runGetty::setreuid:</b>  <b>%m</b>.   The  server  was  unable to change the process identity before starting up the
       getty program.

       <b>GETTY:</b> <b>start</b> <b>pid</b> <b>%u,</b> <b>"%s"</b>.  The server has started up a getty program to service the incoming data  call.
       The getty process identifier is displayed along with the arguments passed to the program.

       <b>GETTY:</b> <b>terminated,</b> <b>exit</b> <b>status</b> <b>%#o</b>.  The server has reaped a getty process which it started up.

       <b>Parse</b>  <b>error</b>  <b>in</b>  <b>dial</b>  <b>string</b>  <b>rules</b> <b>"%s"</b>.  The dial string rules in the specified file contain a syntax
       error.  The <u><a href="../man8/dialtest.8.html">dialtest</a></u>(8) program should be used to debug the problem.

       <b>Unknown</b> <b>answer</b> <b>type</b> <b>"%s"</b>.  The <b>AnswerRotary</b> configuration parameter has an invalid  answer  type  string;
       consult <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-config.5.html">hylafax-config</a></u>(5).

       <b>Syntax</b> <b>error,</b> <b>missing</b> <b>':'</b> <b>in</b> <b>"%s"</b>.
       <b>Syntax</b> <b>error,</b> <b>missing</b> <b>quote</b> <b>mark</b> <b>in</b> <b>"%s"</b>.

       file or in a message received through the FIFO special file.

</pre><h4><b>FAX</b> <b>PROTOCOL</b></h4><pre>
       The following messages may appear when the facsimile protocol tracing (bit 2) is enabled:

       <b>%s:</b> <b>%s</b> <b>(Phase</b> <b>B)</b>.  An error occurred during Phase B of Group 3 protocol processing.

       <b>Bad</b>  <b>HDLC</b>  <b>terminating</b>  <b>flag</b>  <b>received.</b>.   During  Class  1 ECM; a terminating flag for an HDLC frame was
       corrupt.

       <b>DELAY</b> <b>%u</b> <b>ms</b>.  A %u-millisecond delay was done on the host.

       <b>DIAL</b> <b>%s</b>.  The phone number %s was dialed.  Note that this is the phone number passed as  an  argument  to
       the <u>ModemDialCmd</u> parameter and so may not include additional dialing prefixes sent to the modem.

       <b>Error</b> <b>sending</b> <b>T.30</b> <b>prologue</b> <b>frames</b>.  An error occurred while trying to transmit the T.30 DCS frames.

       <b>HDLC</b> <b>frame</b> <b>length</b> <b>invalid</b>.  An ECM HDLC protocol message was excessively long.

       post-page response code in a ``+FPTS:'' status message.

       <b>MODEM</b> <b>protocol</b> <b>botch,</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>parse</b> <b>"%s"</b>.  The Class 2 modem driver  encountered  an  error  parsing  the
       displayed  session  capabilities string.  This is usually due to a communication problem between host and
       modem (though it can also be caused by bogus modem firmware).

       <b>MODEM</b> <b>protocol</b> <b>botch:</b> <b>OK</b> <b>without</b> <b>+FPTS:</b>.  The Class 2 modem driver encountered an error in the host-modem
       protocol for receiving facsimile.  While waiting for the post-page status (``+FPTS:''), an ``OK''  result
       was received first.  This should never happen.

       <b>MODEM</b>  <b>protocol</b>  <b>botch:</b> <b>+FET:</b> <b>without</b> <b>+FPTS:</b>.  The Class 2 modem driver encountered an error in the host-
       modem protocol for receiving facsimile.  While waiting for the post-page status (``+FPTS:''), a ``+FET:''
       status message was received first.  This should never happen.

       <b>POLL</b> <b>with</b> <b>CIG</b> <b>"%s"</b>.  A poll operation is beginning; the Calling Subscriber Identification string that  is
       transmitted to the peer is displayed.

       <b>POLL:</b> <b>begin</b>.  The server is beginning a polled receive operation.

       <b>RECV:</b> <b>bad</b> <b>code</b> <b>word</b> <b>0x%x,</b> <b>len</b> <b>%d,</b> <b>row</b> <b>%lu</b>.

       <b>RECV:</b> <b>begin</b> <b>page</b>.  During a receive operation a new page of data is about to received on the  high  speed
       message carrier.

       <b>RECV:</b>  <b>end</b>  <b>page</b>.   During a receive operation, receipt of page of data on the high speed message carrier
       just completed.

       <b>RECV</b> <b>frame</b> <b>FCS</b> <b>check</b> <b>failed</b>.  During ECM protocol, a received HDLC frame was received which fails the CRC
       check and the frame was marked as corrupt.

       <b>RECV:</b> <b>premature</b> <b>EOF</b>.  The server did not receive &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; to signal the end of a page of facsimile data
       during a page receive operation.

       <b>REMOTE</b> <b>supports</b> <b>POSTSCRIPT</b> <b>transfer</b>.
       <b>REMOTE</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>POSTSCRIPT</b> <b>transfer</b>.  The peer does or does  not  support  the  Adobe  POSTSCRIPT
       transfer extensions to the T.30 protocol.

       <b>RECV:</b>  <b>Missing</b>  <b>EOL</b>  <b>after</b> <b>5</b> <b>seconds</b>.  The server timed out while receiving page data.  This typically is
       caused by a flow control configuration problem that causes data from the modem to the host to be stopped.

       <b>RECV:</b> <b>%u</b> <b>bytes</b> <b>of</b> <b>data,</b> <b>%lu</b> <b>total</b> <b>lines</b>.  While receiving page data, %u bytes of raw data were  received;
       the current total number of rows in the page are also displayed.

       <b>RECV:</b>  <b>%lu</b> <b>bad</b> <b>lines</b> <b>%lu</b> <b>consecutive</b> <b>bad</b> <b>lines</b>.  After the completion of a page receive, the total number
       of rows received in error and the maximum consecutive rows that  were  received  in  error  are  printed.
       These numbers should always be zero unless copy quality checking is done in the host.

       <b>RECV</b>  <b>received</b>  <b>%u</b> <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>block</b> <b>%u</b> <b>of</b> <b>page</b> <b>%u</b>.  When the server does Class 1 ECM; a complete block has
       been received with a given number of frames for a named page.

       <b>RECV</b> <b>received</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>RCP</b> <b>frame</b> <b>with</b> <b>block</b> <b>end</b>.   When  the  server  does  Class  1  ECM;  the  block-end
       indicator  was  received without a proper RCP frame and the receipt of an RCP frame was therefore assumed
       or feigned.

       <b>RECV</b> <b>received</b> <b>frame</b> <b>number</b> <b>%u</b>.  When the server does Class 1 ECM;  the  numbered  image  frame  has  been
       received.

       <b>RECV</b>  <b>received</b>  <b>RCP</b>  <b>frame</b>.   When  the  server does Class 1 ECM; the first RCP frame was received, which
       signifies the end of the image block.

       <b>RECV:</b> <b>REJECT</b> <b>page</b> <b>quality,</b> <b>%u%%</b> <b>good</b> <b>lines</b> <b>(%u%%</b> <b>required)</b>.  When the server does copy quality  checking;
       the  received page is deemed to have unacceptable quality because the percentage of good rows in the page
       is too low.  This check is controlled by the <b>PercentGoodLines</b> configuration parameter.

       <b>RECV:</b> <b>REJECT</b> <b>page</b> <b>quality,</b> <b>%u-line</b> <b>run</b> <b>(max</b> <b>%u)</b>.   When  the  server  does  copy  quality  checking;  the
       received  page  is  deemed  to  have  unacceptable quality because the maximum consecutive rows that were
       received in error exceeds the threshold specified by the <b>MaxBadLines</b> configuration parameter.

       <b>RECV</b> <b>sent</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>PPR</b>.  During Class 1 ECM; the server has rejected a received image  block  consecutively
       four  times  at  which  point  the sender is allowed to either continue to retransmit the block or to end
       retransmissions.

       <b>REMOTE</b> <b>HANGUP:</b> <b>%s</b> <b>(code</b> <b>%s)</b>.  The modem returned a hangup status code (``+FHNG:'' or  ``+FHS:'')  to  the
       host.   This  indicates a protocol problem that was determined <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>modem</b>; there is usually nothing
       that the server can do to work around such errors.

       <b>REMOTE</b> <b>TSI</b> <b>"%s"</b>.  During a receive operation, the specified TSI was received.   This  string  is  checked
       against the TSI access control list described in <u><a href="../man5/tsi.5.html">tsi</a></u>(5).

       <b>REMOTE</b>  <b>best</b>  <b>format</b>  <b>%s</b>.  The peers' ``best'' data format according to the received DIS frame.  ``Best''
       here is based on the belief that 2DMMR data is better than  2DMR  with  optional  uncompressed  data,  is
       better than 2DMR data, is better than 1DMH data.

       <b>REMOTE</b> <b>best</b> <b>rate</b> <b>%s</b>.  The peers' best signalling rate according to the received DIS frame.

       <b>REMOTE</b> <b>best</b> <b>vres</b> <b>%s</b>.  The peers' best vertical resolution according to the received DIS frame.

       <b>REMOTE</b> <b>has</b> <b>document</b> <b>to</b> <b>POLL</b>.  The peer indicates it has a document that is available for retrieval.

       <b>REMOTE</b> <b>max</b> <b>%s</b>.  The peers' maximum page width/length according to the received DIS frame.

       <b>REMOTE</b>  <b>supports</b>  <b>error</b> <b>correction</b>.  The peer supports the optional Error Correct Mode (ECM) according to
       the received DIS frame.

       <b>REMOTE</b> <b>wants</b> <b>%s</b>.  The received DCS frame indicates the peer wants the specified capability.

       <b>SEND</b> <b>file</b> <b>"%s"</b>.  The specified file is about to be transmitted.

       <b>SEND</b> <b>1D</b> <b>RTC</b>.
       <b>SEND</b> <b>2D</b> <b>RTC</b>.  A 1D- or 2D-encoded Return To Control (RTC) packet was sent to terminate  the  transmission
       of a page of facsimile data.

       <b>SEND</b> <b>begin</b> <b>page</b>.  A page of facsimile data is about to be transmitted on the high speed message carrier.

       <b>SEND</b>  <b>end</b>  <b>page</b>.   The  transmission  of  a  page of facsimile data on the high speed message carrier was
       completed.

       <b>SEND</b> <b>training</b> <b>at</b> <b>%s</b> <b>%s</b>.  Training is about to be sent to the peer  using  the  specified  modulation  and
       signalling rate.

       <b>SENT</b> <b>%u</b> <b>bytes</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b>.  The specified amount of raw facsimile page data was transmitted on the high speed
       message carrier.

       <b>TRAINING</b> <b>failed</b>.
       <b>TRAINING</b> <b>succeeded</b>.  Peer training succeeded or failed.  When sending this is based on a message returned
       by the peer.  When receiving this is based on an analysis of the received TCF data.

       <b>USE</b>  <b>%s</b>.   Use the specified session capability during a send or receive.  The capability is based on the
       peers' best capabilities, the capabilities of the modem, and, when transmitting, the  characteristics  of
       the document.

</pre><h4><b>MODEM</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following messages may appear when modem operation tracing (bit 3) is enabled:

       <b>MODEM</b>  <b>set</b>  <b>baud</b> <b>rate:</b> <b>%d</b> <b>baud,</b> <b>input</b> <b>flow</b> <b>%s,</b> <b>output</b> <b>flow</b> <b>%s</b>.  The DTE-DCE communication rate was set %d
       bits/sec on the host and the specified flow control method was setup for data  received  from  the  modem
       (input) and transmitted to the modem (output).

       <b>MODEM</b>  <b>set</b>  <b>baud</b>  <b>rate:</b>  <b>%d</b>  <b>baud</b>  <b>(flow</b>  <b>control</b> <b>unchanged)</b>.  The DTE-DCE communication rate was changed
       without modifying the current flow control setup.

       <b>MODEM</b> <b>set</b> <b>XON/XOFF/NOW:</b> <b>input</b> <b>%s,</b> <b>output</b> <b>%s</b>.
       <b>MODEM</b> <b>set</b> <b>XON/XOFF/DRAIN:</b> <b>input</b> <b>%s,</b> <b>output</b> <b>%s</b>.
       <b>MODEM</b> <b>set</b> <b>XON/XOFF/FLUSH:</b> <b>input</b> <b>%s,</b> <b>output</b> <b>%s</b>.  The  software  flow  control  setup  for  data  exchanged
       between host and modem was changed.  The NOW , DRAIN , and FLUSH , actions indicate whether the operation
       is  done  immediately,  after  any  pending  data  is  transmitted to the modem, or after pending data is
       discarded.  On input XON/XOFF characters are either <u>ignored</u> (passed through to the server  uninterpreted)
       or  <u>interpreted</u>  (by  the  system's  terminal driver in order to control the flow of data).  Likewise, on
       output XON/XOFF characters are either <u>disabled</u> (not generated by the terminal driver), or  <u>generated</u>  (by
       the terminal driver to effect flow control of data from the modem to the host).

       <b>MODEM</b> <b>input</b> <b>buffering</b> <b>enabled</b>.
       <b>MODEM</b>  <b>input</b>  <b>buffering</b>  <b>disabled</b>.   On  systems  that  buffer  input data in the operating system before
       delivering it to applications the server will enable and disable buffering as best it can in those  cases
       where low input latency is critical.

       <b>TIMEOUT:</b>  <b>%s</b>.   A  timeout  occurred  while doing a modem-related operation; typically reading or writing
       data.

       <b>Error</b> <b>#%u</b> <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> <b>modem</b>.  An error was returned by a <u><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></u>(2) system call.  This usually happens when
       the modem prematurely drops the DCD signal.

</pre><h4><b>MODEM</b> <b>COMMUNICATION</b></h4><pre>
       The following messages may appear when modem communication tracing (bit 4) is enabled:

       <b>--&gt;</b> <b>[%d:%s]</b>.  A %d-byte line of data was received from the modem.  Printable data are displayed.

       <b>&lt;--</b> <b>data</b> <b>[%d]</b>.  %d bytes of unprintable data were sent to the modem, typically facsimile data.

       <b>&lt;--</b> <b>[%d:%s]</b>.  %d bytes of printable data were sent to the modem.  The data are displayed.

</pre><h4><b>TIMEOUTS</b></h4><pre>
       The following messages may appear when timeout tracing (bit 5) is enabled:
       <b>start</b> <b>%d</b> <b>second</b> <b>timer</b>,
       <b>stop</b> <b>timer</b> (stop the current timeout before it expires), and
       <b>stop</b> <b>timer</b> <b>-</b> <b>timer</b> <b>expired</b> (the current timeout expired.)

</pre><h4><b>HDLC</b> <b>FRAMES</b></h4><pre>
       When tracing of raw HDLC frames (bit  6)  is  enabled  each  frame  sent  and  received  is  logged:  <b>&lt;--</b>
       <b>HDLC&lt;%u:%.*s&gt;</b>  for sent frames and <b>--&gt;</b> <b>HDLC&lt;%u:%.*s&gt;</b> for received frames.  These messages indicate that a
       %u-byte long HDLC frame was sent or received.  The first byte should always be 0xff,  the  address  field
       specified  for  dialup  communication.  The second byte should be a frame control field.  The contents of
       the frame is displayed as sequence of bytes in hexadecimal.

</pre><h4><b>BINARY</b> <b>I/O</b></h4><pre>
       When binary input/output (bit 7) is traced there are two types of messages logged: <b>&lt;--</b> <b>&lt;%u:%.*s&gt;</b> for data
       sent to the modem and <b>--&gt;</b> <b>&lt;%u:%.*s&gt;</b> for data received from the modem.  Each  message  indicates  that  %u
       bytes of data were transferred.  The data is displayed as a sequence of bytes in hexadecimal.

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>STATE</b> <b>TRANSITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Bit  8  controls  the  tracing  of  state transitions in the facsimile server.  There are currently eight
       states:
              <b>State</b>        <b>Description</b>
              BASE         during startup and initialization
              RUNNING      normal operation
              MODEMWAIT    waiting for the modem to come ready after a reset
              LOCKWAIT     waiting for a UUCP lockfile to be removed
              GETTYWAIT    waiting for a <u>getty</u> process to terminate
              SENDING      transmitting a facsimile
              ANSWERING    answering an incoming telephone call
              RECEIVING    receiving a facsimile

       <b>STATE</b> <b>CHANGE:</b> <b>%s</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>%s</b> <b>(timeout</b> <b>%ld)</b>.  The server is  changing  its  internal  state.   The  timeout  (in
       seconds) is used when polling for asynchronous events such as a modem becoming ready.

       <b>STATE</b> <b>CHANGE:</b> <b>%s</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>%s</b>.  The server is changing its internal state without starting a timeout.

</pre><h4><b>QUEUE</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Bit 9 controls the tracing the management of the job queue.

       <b>SEND</b>  <b>NOT</b>  <b>READY:</b>  <b>"%s"</b>  <b>in</b>  <b>%s</b>.   It was not time to send the specified job; it will be requeued for the
       indicated time interval.

       <b>SEND</b> <b>BLOCKED</b> <b>BY</b> <b>CONCURRENT</b> <b>CALL:</b> <b>"%s"</b> <b>in</b> <b>%s</b>.  The specified job is blocked by another call  to  the  same
       phone number; it will be requeued for the indicated time interval.

       <b>SEND</b>  <b>BLOCKED</b>  <b>BY</b>  <b>CONCURRENT</b> <b>JOB:</b> <b>"%s"</b> <b>by</b> <b>"%s"</b>.  The specified job is blocked by another job to the same
       phone number; it will be requeued for the indicated time interval.

       <b>JOB</b> <b>"%s"</b>.  The specified job is about to be processed.

       <b>CONVERT</b> <b>POSTSCRIPT:</b> <b>"%s"</b>.  The server is about to invoke the POSTSCRIPT interpreter to image a  document;
       the shell command used is displayed.

       <b>JOB</b>  <b>TIMER</b>  <b>START</b>  <b>%s</b>.  The timer used to control scanning of the job queue is started with the displayed
       value.

       <b>JOB</b> <b>TIMER</b> <b>STOP</b> <b>(Q</b> <b>head</b> <b>%s</b> <b>tts</b> <b>%s)</b>.  The timer used to control scanning of the job queue is stopped.   The
       job at the head of the queue and that job's time-to-send are displayed.

       <b>JOB</b> <b>TIMER</b> <b>STOP</b> <b>(Q</b> <b>empty)</b>.  The timer used to control scanning of the job queue is stopped.  The job queue
       was found to be empty.

</pre><h4><b>COPY</b> <b>QUALITY</b></h4><pre>
       When  doing  copy quality checking during a receive operation the following messages may be logged if bit
       10 is set:

       <b>RECV/CQ:</b> <b>adjusting</b> <b>for</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>noise</b> <b>(%lu</b> <b>run)</b>.  The total number of rows of data in the  received  page
       is adjusted (downward) by %lu.  This is done to handle the case where garbage data are received after the
       RTC resulting in some number of consecutive bad rows after the page data.

       <b>RECV/CQ:</b> <b>Invalid</b> <b>%s</b> <b>code</b> <b>word,</b> <b>row</b> <b>%lu,</b> <b>x</b> <b>%d</b>.  An invalid 1D- or 2D- T.4 code word was encountered on the
       specified  row  and  horizontal  offset within the row.  When this occurs the server will scan for an EOL
       code and then regenerate the bad row with the last good row of data.

       <b>RECV/CQ:</b> <b>Premature</b> <b>EOL</b> <b>(%s),</b> <b>row</b> <b>%lu,</b> <b>x</b> <b>%d</b>.  An EOL code was encountered before a complete row of  pixels
       was received.  When this occurs the server will discard the bad row and replace it with the last good row
       that was received.

       <b>RECV/CQ:</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>%s</b> <b>pixel</b> <b>count,</b> <b>row</b> <b>%lu,</b> <b>x</b> <b>%d</b>.  A row of data was received with pixel count greater than the
       negotiated page width.  When this occurs the server will discard the bad row and replace it with the last
       good row that was received.

       <b>RECV/CQ:</b>  <b>Panic,</b>  <b>bad</b>  <b>%s</b>  <b>decoding</b>  <b>state,</b>  <b>row</b> <b>%lu,</b> <b>x</b> <b>%d</b>.  The decoder state machine was found in a bad
       internal state.  When this occurs the server will scan for an EOL code and regenerate the row  using  the
       last good received row.
