       TQSL - digitally sign amateur radio contact logs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tqsl</b> -i [<u>certificate-file</u>]...
       <b>tqsl</b> -s [<u>station</u>location<u>]...</u>

       <b>tqsl</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] [<u>log-file</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>TrustedQSL</b>  is  a  file  format  and  set  of  procedures  that is used to send digitally signed QSL
       information (logs of contacts between amateur radio operators).  One notable service that makes  use
       of TrustedQSL is ARRL's <u>Logbook</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>World.</u>

       The <b>tqsl</b> program is used to digitally sign contact log files using a digital certificate. It is also
       used  to  generate  requests  for  digital  certificates and to store the resulting received digital
       certificates.  (Certificates used to be handled by a separate program, <b>tqslcert</b>, but  all  functions
       are now handled by tqsl).

       This manual page briefly documents the <b>tqsl</b> program.  Complete documentation is also available:

         <b>tqsl</b>: file:///usr/share/TrustedQSL/help/tqslapp/main.htm

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tqsl</b> accepts these command line options:

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--action=</b> <u>action</u> <b>[abort</b>, <b>all</b>, <b>compliant</b>, or <b>ask</b> ]
              Specify  a  default  dialog action when non-compliant QSOs are detected (these are cases with
              invalid callsigns, QSOs already uploaded, for examples. The option value <u>abort</u> causes TQSL to
              abort signing when an invalid QSO is processed. <u>all</u> causes all QSOs to  be  signed,  ignoring
              errors.   <u>compliant</u>  indicates that invalid QSOs should be skipped, and <u>ask</u> asks the user how
              to proceed.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--begindate=</b> <u>begin_date</u> <b>and</b> <b>-e,</b> <b>--enddate=</b> <u>end_date</u>
              Supply a start date and end date for QSOs to be signed. If present, any QSOs before the begin
              date will be ignored, and any after the end date will be ignored. If either begin or end  are
              omitted,  then  the corresponding limit is ignored. You should specify <u>-d</u> with this option to
              suppress the normal date range dialog as these options will override the user-specified dates
              if given.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--callsign=</b> <u>callsign</u>
              Specify the default callsign for log signing.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--nodate</b>
              Suppress date-range dialog. If present, the QSO date-range dialog will not be shown for files
              that follow this option on the command line.

       <b>-f,--verify=</b><u>option</u> [<b>ignore</b>, <b>reportl</b>, or <b>update</b> ]
              Specify  QSO  verification  action  for  QTH  details.  This  option  controls  how  location
              information  in  an  ADIF  file  is  handled.  Using <u>ignore</u> indicates that TQSL should ignore
              location data.  Using <u>report</u> causes TQSL to report any discrepancies  between  the  currently
              selected  <u>Station</u>  <u>Location</u>  and the ADIF location information.  Using <u>updaate</u> causes the new
              location details from the ADIF file to be used, overriding the <u>Station</u> <u>Location</u> details.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Displays command line usage summary.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--import=</b> <b>filename</b>
              Import a certificate - either a signed response (.tq6) or a certificate stored with a private
              key in PKCS#12 format (.p12).

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--location=</b> <u>location_name</u>
              Selects an existing station location. This location  will  be  used  for  the  commands  that
              follow. If the station location doesn't exist, <b>tqsl</b> will just exit.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--updates</b>
              Check for updates to TQSL, the configuration file, and for certificate expiration.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--outut=</b> <u>output_file</u>
              Writes  the  resulting  signed log file to <u>output_file</u> instead of a default name based on the
              input <u>log-file</u> name.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--password=</b> <u>password</u>
              Specify the pasphrase for the callsign certificate being used to sign a log.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--editlocation</b> <b>location-name</b>
              Add or edit station location. If there is a preceding -l option the specified  location  will
              be edited. If there is no preceding -l option, a new station location is being added.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--diagnose=</b> <b>filename</b>
              Open  a diagnostic trace file at startup. This file will log internal TQSL function calls for
              debugging purposes.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--upload</b>
              Upload log file. If this argument is used, the input files will be signed then  automatically
              uploaded to the Logbook of the World web site for processing.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Display the version number of <b>tqsl</b> and exit.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--wipe</b>
              Delete  the  contact  upload database. This should be used only for cases where that database
              has become corrupted, typically due to Oracle BerkeleyDB misbehavior.

       <b>-x,</b>--batch <b>(or)</b> -q,<b>--quiet</b>
              Exit <b>tqsl</b>. If this argument is used it should be the last one on the command  line.  If  this
              argument  is  not present, <b>tqsl</b> will begin normal operation after successfully processing all
              command-line arguments.

       <b>log-files</b>
              Any command-line parameter that is not an option or an option's argument will be  treated  as
              the name of a log file (ADIF or Cabrillo) to be signed. The resulting signed file (.tq8) will
              be  placed  in  the same directory as the log file, overwriting any existing .tq8 file of the
              same name. (Note: If this option is not preceded by a -l  option  that  selects  the  station
              location  to  be  used  for  signing,  the Select Station Location for Signing dialog will be
              presented.) File names that contain spaces or other shell-special characters should be quoted
              in a manner suitable for the operating system and shell that's being used. If -u is used, the
              signed log is not saved to disk but is instead uploaded  and  submitted  to  Logbook  of  the
              World.

              N.B.:  If  the  private key needed to sign a log is protected by a password, the user will be
              prompted to supply that password for each file being signed.
