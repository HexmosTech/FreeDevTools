       moderators - Submission addresses for moderated groups

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When an unapproved article is posted locally to a moderated newsgroup, it is not passed off to <b>innd</b> for
       normal handling; instead, it is sent via e-mail to the submission address for that newsgroup.  The
       submission address is determined using this configuration file.

       The file <u>pathetc</u>/moderators is a list of associations between <u>uwildmat</u> patterns matching newsgroups and
       the submission address for those newsgroups.  Blank lines and lines starting with a number sign ("#") are
       ignored.  All other lines should consist of two fields separated by a colon:

           &lt;pattern&gt;:&lt;address&gt;

       The first field is a <u>uwildmat</u> pattern matching the group or groups to which this line applies.  The first
       matching line is used, so more specific patterns should be listed before general patterns.

       The second field, the submission address, should be a simple e-mail address with one exception: at most
       one "%s" may occur anywhere in the address.  If present, it will be replaced by the name of the
       newsgroup, with all periods in the name changed to dashes ("-").  If there is a literal "%" in the
       submission address, it must be written as "%%", even if not followed by an "s".

       With the "%s" syntax, periods are converted to dashes for historical reasons, from back in the days when
       periods in the local part of addresses were not always handled correctly.  It's probably no longer
       necessary, but so much now depends on it that it can't be easily changed.

       It's intended that the sample <u>moderators</u> file included in the INN distribution always be sufficient for
       all world-wide newsgroups.  The hosts behind "moderators.isc.org" have graciously volunteered to handle
       forwarding tasks for all world-wide newsgroups so that individual sites don't have to keep track of the
       submission addresses for moderated groups.  The forwarding database used by "moderators.isc.org" is
       coordinated by &lt;<a href="mailto:moderators-request@isc.org">moderators-request@isc.org</a>&gt;; if you know of a world-wide newsgroup hierarchy that is not
       correctly handled by "moderators.isc.org", please send the details to that address.

       Given that, the only thing you should have to add to the sample file under normal circumstances are the
       forwarding addresses for local or limited-distribution moderated groups.

       If this file doesn't exist, or if a post is made to a moderated group that has no matching entry in this
       file, <b>nnrpd</b> falls back on the value of <u>moderatormailer</u> set in <u>inn.conf</u> and, failing that, rejects the
       post.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a sample file:

           example.important:<a href="mailto:announce@example.com">announce@example.com</a>
           example.*:%<a href="mailto:s@smtp.example.com">s@smtp.example.com</a>
           *:%<a href="mailto:s@moderators.isc.org">s@moderators.isc.org</a>

       Using the above file, postings to the moderated newsgroup in the left column below will be sent to the
       address shown in the right column below:

           example.important   <a href="mailto:announce@example.com">announce@example.com</a>
           example.x-announce  <a href="mailto:example-x-announce@smtp.example.com">example-x-announce@smtp.example.com</a>
           alt.dev.null        <a href="mailto:alt-dev-null@moderators.isc.org">alt-dev-null@moderators.isc.org</a>

       Note that periods are changed to dashes and dashes are left alone with the "%s" syntax, so two moderated
       newsgroups whose names differ only by changing a period to a dash would go to the same address.  Such
       newsgroup pairs should therefore not be created.
