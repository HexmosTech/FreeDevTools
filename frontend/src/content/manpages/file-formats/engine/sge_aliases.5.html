       sge_aliases - Grid Engine path aliases file format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Grid  Engine  path  aliasing  facility  provides  administrators and users with the means to reflect
       complicated and inhomogeneous file system structures in  distributed  environments  (such  as  user  home
       directories  mounted  under different paths on different hosts) and to ensure that Grid Engine is able to
       locate the appropriate working directories for executing batch jobs.

       There is a system global path aliasing file and a user-local file.  <u>sge_aliases</u>  defines  the  format  of
       both:

       •  Blank lines, and lines with a '#' sign in the first column, are skipped.

       •  Each  line  other than a blank line or a line with a leading '#' has to contain four strings separated
          by any number of blanks or tabs.

       •  The first string specifies a source path, the second a submit host, the third an execution  host,  and
          the fourth the source path replacement.

       •  Both the submit and the execution host entries may consist of only a '*' sign which matches any host.

       If the <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1)
        <u>-cwd</u>  flag  is  specified  (and  only  if - otherwise the user's home directory on the execution host is
       selected to execute the job), the path aliasing mechanism is activated, and the files  are  processed  as
       follows:

       •  After  <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1)  has  retrieved  the  physical  current working directory path, the cluster global path
          aliasing file is read, if present. The user path aliases  file  is  read  afterwards  as  if  it  were
          appended to the global file.

       •  Lines  not to be skipped are read from the top of the file one by one while the translations specified
          by those lines are stored if necessary.

       •  A translation is stored only if the submit host entry matches the host <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1) is executed on  and  if
          the  source  path forms the initial part of either the current working directory or of the source path
          replacements already stored.

       •  As soon as both files are read the  stored,  path  aliasing  information  is  passed  along  with  the
          submitted job.

       •  On  the  execution  host,  the aliasing information will be evaluated. The leading part of the current
          working directory will be replaced by the source-path replacement if the execution-host entry  of  the
          path  alias  matches the executing host. <b>Note:</b> The current working directory string will be changed in
          this case, and subsequent path aliases must match the replaced working directory path to be applied.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following is a simple example of a path aliasing file resolving problems with inhomogeneous paths  if
       <u><a href="../man8/automount.8.html">automount</a></u>(8) is used:

       =====================================================
       # Path Aliasing File
       # src-path   sub-host   exec-host   replacement
       /tmp_mnt/    *          *           /
       # replaces any occurrence of /tmp_mnt/ by /
       # if submitting or executing on any host.
       # Thus paths on nfs server and clients are the same
       =====================================================

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>&lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/common/sge_aliases</u>
                     global aliases file
       <u>$HOME/.sge_aliases</u>   user local aliases file
