</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sge_conf - Grid Engine configuration files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>sge_conf</u>  defines  the  global and local Grid Engine configurations and can be shown/modified by <u><a href="../man1/qconf.1.html">qconf</a></u>(1)
       using the -sconf/-mconf options. Only root or the cluster administrator may modify <u>sge_conf.</u>

       At its initial start-up, <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8) checks to see if a valid Grid Engine configuration  is  available
       at  a  well  known  location  in  the  Grid  Engine  internal  directory hierarchy.  If so, it loads that
       configuration information and proceeds.  If not, <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8) writes a generic configuration containing
       default values to that same location.  The Grid  Engine  execution  daemons  <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8)  upon  start-up
       retrieve their configuration from <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8).

       The  actual  configuration  for  both  <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8)  and  <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8)  is  a superposition of a <u>global</u>
       configuration and a <u>local</u> configuration pertinent for the host on which  a  master  or  execution  daemon
       resides.   If  a local configuration is available, its entries overwrite the corresponding entries of the
       global configuration. <b>Note:</b> The local configuration does not have  to  contain  all  valid  configuration
       entries, but only those which need to be modified against the global entries.

       Note:  Grid  Engine  allows  backslashes  (\) be used to escape newline characters. The backslash and the
       newline are replaced with a space (" ") character before any interpretation.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The paragraphs that follow provide brief descriptions of  the  individual  parameters  that  compose  the
       global and local configurations for a Grid Engine cluster:

   <b>execd_spool_dir</b>
       The  execution  daemon spool directory path. Again, a feasible spool directory requires read/write access
       permission for root. The entry in the global configuration for  this  parameter  can  be  overwritten  by
       execution  host  local  configurations,  i.e. each <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) may have a private spool directory with a
       different path, in which case it needs to provide read/write permission  for  the  root  account  of  the
       corresponding execution host only.

       Under  <b>execd_spool_dir</b>  a directory named corresponding to the unqualified hostname of the execution host
       is opened and contains all information spooled to disk. Thus, it is possible for the <b>execd_spool_dir</b>s  of
       all  execution  hosts  to  physically  reference  the  same  directory path (the root access restrictions
       mentioned above need to be met, however).

       Changing the global <b>execd_spool_dir</b> parameter set at installation time is  not  supported  in  a  running
       system.  If  the  change  should  still be done it is required to restart all affected execution daemons.
       Please make sure running jobs have finished before doing so, otherwise running jobs will be lost.

       The default location for the execution daemon spool directory is $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/spool.

       The global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be  overwritten  by  the  execution  host  local
       configuration.

   <b>mailer</b>
       <b>mailer</b> is the absolute pathname to the electronic mail delivery agent on your system.  An optional prefix
       "user@"  specifies the user under which this procedure is to be started; the default is root.  The mailer
       must accept the following syntax:

              mailer -s &lt;subject-of-mail-message&gt; &lt;recipient&gt;

       Each <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) may use a private mail agent. Changing <b>mailer</b> will take immediate effect.

       The default for <b>mailer</b> depends on the operating system of the  host  on  which  the  Grid  Engine  master
       installation  was run. Common values are /bin/mail or /usr/bin/Mail.  Note that since the mail is sent by
       compute hosts, not the master, it may be necessary to take steps to route it appropriately, e.g. by using
       a cluster head node as a "smart host" for the private network.

       The global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be  overwritten  by  the  execution  host  local
       configuration.

   <b>xterm</b>
       <b>xterm</b> is the absolute pathname to the X Window System terminal emulator, <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1).

       Changing <b>xterm</b> will take immediate effect.

       The default for <b>xterm</b> is system-dependent.

       The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be  overwritten  by  the  execution  host local
       configuration.

   <b>load_sensor</b>
       A comma-separated list of executable shell script paths or programs to be started by <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) and  to
       be  used  in  order  to  retrieve  site-configurable  load information (e.g. free space on a certain disk
       partition).

       Each <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) may use a set of private <b>load_sensor</b> programs or  scripts.  Changing  <b>load_sensor</b>  will
       take  effect  after  two  load  report  intervals (see <b>load_report_time</b>). A load sensor will be restarted
       automatically if the file modification time of the load sensor executable changes.

       The global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be  overwritten  by  the  execution  host  local
       configuration.

       In  addition  to the load sensors configured via <b>load_sensor</b>, <u><a href="../man8/sge_exec.8.html">sge_exec</a></u>(8) searches for an executable file
       named <u>qloadsensor</u> in the execution host's Grid Engine binary directory path.  If such a file is found, it
       is treated like the configurable load sensors defined in <b>load_sensor</b>. This facility is intended for  pre-
       installing a default load sensor.  See <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) for information on writing load sensors.

   <b>prolog</b>
       The  path of an executable, with optional arguments, that is started before execution of Grid Engine jobs
       with the same environment setting as that for  the  Grid  Engine  jobs  to  be  started  afterwards  (see
       <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1)).   The prolog command is started directly, not in a shell.  An optional prefix "user@" specifies
       the user under which this procedure is to be started.  In  that  case  see  the  SECURITY  section  below
       concerning  security  issues running as a privileged user.  The procedure's standard output and the error
       output stream are written to the same file as used for the standard output and error output of each job.

       This procedure is intended as a means for the Grid Engine administrator  to  automate  the  execution  of
       general  site-specific  tasks,  like  the preparation of temporary file systems, with a need for the same
       context information as the job.  For a parallel job, only a single instance of the prolog is run, on  the
       master  node.  Each <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) may use a private prolog.  Correspondingly, the global or execution host
       local configuration can be overwritten by the queue configuration (see <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5)).   Changing  <b>prolog</b>
       will take immediate effect.

       The default for <b>prolog</b> is the special value NONE, which prevents execution of a prolog.

       The  following  special variables, expanded at runtime, can be used (besides any other strings which have
       to be interpreted by the procedure) to compose a command line:

       <u>$host</u>  The name of the host on which the prolog or epilog procedures are started.

       <u>$ja_task_id</u>
              The array job task index (0 if not an array job).

       <u>$job_owner</u>
              The user name of the job owner.

       <u>$job_id</u>
              Grid Engine's unique job identification number.

       <u>$job_name</u>
              The name of the job.

       <u>$processors</u>
              The <b>processors</b> string as contained in the queue configuration (see <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5))  of  the  master
              queue (the queue in which the prolog and epilog procedures are started).

       <u>$queue</u> The  cluster  queue  name of the master queue instance, i.e. the cluster queue in which the prolog
              and epilog procedures are started.

       <u>$stdin_path</u>
              The pathname of the stdin file. This is always /dev/null for prolog, pe_start, pe_stop and epilog.
              It is the pathname of the stdin file for the job in the job script. When delegated file staging is
              enabled, this path is set to $fs_stdin_tmp_path. When delegated file staging is not enabled, it is
              the stdin pathname given via DRMAA or qsub.

       <u>$stdout_path</u>

       <u>$stderr_path</u>
              The pathname of the stdout/stderr  file.  This  always  points  to  the  output/error  file.  When
              delegated  file  staging  is enabled, this path is set to $fs_stdout_tmp_path/$fs_stderr_tmp_path.
              When delegated file staging is not enabled, it is the stdout/stderr pathname given  via  DRMAA  or
              qsub.

       <u>$merge_stderr</u>
              If  this  flag  is  1,  stdout and stderr are merged in one file, the stdout file.  Otherwise (the
              default), no merging is done.  Merging of stderr and stdout can be requested  via  the  DRMAA  job
              template  attribute 'drmaa_join_files' (see <u><a href="../man3/drmaa_attributes.3.html">drmaa_attributes</a></u>(3)) or the qsub parameter '-j y' (see
              <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1)).

       <u>$fs_stdin_host</u>
              When delegated file staging is requested for the stdin file, this is the name of  the  host  where
              the stdin file has to be copied from before the job is started.

       <u>$fs_stdout_host</u>

       <u>$fs_stderr_host</u>
              When  delegated file staging is requested for the stdout/stderr file, this is the name of the host
              where the stdout/stderr file has to be copied to after the job has run.

       <u>$fs_stdin_path</u>
              When delegated file staging is requested for the stdin file, this is the  pathname  of  the  stdin
              file on the host $fs_stdin_host.

       <u>$fs_stdout_path</u>

       <u>$fs_stderr_path</u>
              When  delegated  file staging is requested for the stdout/stderr file, this is the pathname of the
              stdout/stderr file on the host $fs_stdout_host/$fs_stderr_host.

       <u>$fs_stdin_tmp_path</u>
              When delegated file staging is requested for the stdin file, this is the destination  pathname  of
              the   stdin   file   on   the   execution   host.  The  prolog  must  copy  the  stdin  file  from
              $fs_stdin_host:$fs_stdin_path to localhost:$fs_stdin_tmp_path to establish delegated file  staging
              of the stdin file.

       <u>$fs_stdout_tmp_path</u>

       <u>$fs_stderr_tmp_path</u>
              When  delegated  file staging is requested for the stdout/stderr file, this is the source pathname
              of the stdout/stderr file on the execution host.  The  epilog  must  copy  the  stdout  file  from
              localhost:$fs_stdout_tmp_path   to   $fs_stdout_host:$fs_stdout_path   (the   stderr   file   from
              localhost:$fs_stderr_tmp_path to  $fs_stderr_host:$fs_stderr_path)  to  establish  delegated  file
              staging of the stdout/stderr file.

       <u>$fs_stdin_file_staging</u>

       <u>$fs_stdout_file_staging</u>

       <u>$fs_stderr_file_staging</u>
              When delegated file staging is requested for the stdin/stdout/stderr file, the flag is set to "1",
              otherwise  it  is set to "0" (see in <b>delegated_file_staging</b> how to enable delegated file staging).
              These three flags correspond to the  DRMAA  job  template  attribute  'drmaa_transfer_files'  (see
              <u><a href="../man3/drmaa_attributes.3.html">drmaa_attributes</a></u>(3)).

       If  the  prolog  is  written  in shell script, the usual care must be exercised, e.g. when expanding such
       values from the command line or the environment which are user-supplied.  In particular,  note  that  the
       job name could be of the form "; evil doings;".  Also, use absolute path names for commands if inheriting
       the user's environment.

       The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be  overwritten  by  the  execution  host local
       configuration.

       See <u><a href="../man8/sge_shepherd.8.html">sge_shepherd</a></u>(8) for the significance of exit codes returned by the prolog.

   <b>epilog</b>
       The path of an executable, with optional argument, that is started after execution of  Grid  Engine  jobs
       with  the same environment setting as that for the Grid Engine job that has just completed (see <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1)),
       with the addition of the variable named <b>SGE_JOBEXIT_STAT</b> which holds the exit status  of  the  job.   The
       epilog  command is started directly, not in a shell.  An optional prefix "user@" specifies the user under
       which this procedure is to be started.  In that case see the SECURITY section below  concerning  security
       issues  running  as  a  privileged user.  The procedure's standard output and the error output stream are
       written to the same file used for the standard output and error output of each job.

       The same special variables can be used to compose a command line as for the prolog.

       This procedure is intended as a means for the Grid Engine administrator  to  automate  the  execution  of
       general  site-specific  tasks,  like the cleaning up of temporary file systems with the need for the same
       context information as the job.  For a parallel job, only a single instance of the epilog is run, on  the
       master  node.  Each <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) may use a private epilog.  Correspondingly, the global or execution host
       local configurations can be overwritten by the queue configuration (see <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5)).  Changing  <b>epilog</b>
       will take immediate effect.

       The  default  for  <b>epilog</b>  is  the  special  value NONE, which prevents execution of an epilog.  The same
       special variables as for <b>prolog</b> can be used to constitute a command line.

       The same considerations (above) apply as for a prolog when an epilog is written in shell script.

       See <u><a href="../man8/sge_shepherd.8.html">sge_shepherd</a></u>(8) for the significance of exit codes returned by the epilog.

   <b>shell_start_mode</b>
       <b>Note:</b> Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
       This parameter defines the mechanisms which are used to actually invoke the job scripts on the  execution
       hosts. The following values are recognized:

       <u>unix_behavior</u>
              If  a  user starts a job shell script under UNIX interactively by invoking it just with the script
              name the operating system's executable loader uses the information provided in a comment  such  as
              `#!/bin/csh'  in  the  first  line  of  the script to detect which command interpreter to start to
              interpret the script. This mechanism is used by Grid Engine when starting jobs if <u>unix_behavior</u> is
              defined as <b>shell_start_mode</b>.

       <u>posix_compliant</u>
              POSIX does not consider first script line comments such a `#!/bin/csh' as significant.  The  POSIX
              standard  for  batch queueing systems (P1003.2d) therefore requires a compliant queueing system to
              ignore such lines, but to use user-specified or configured default command  interpreters  instead.
              Thus,  if  <b>shell_start_mode</b>  is  set  to  <u>posix_compliant</u>  Grid Engine will either use the command
              interpreter indicated by the <b>-S</b> option of the <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1) command or the <b>shell</b> parameter of the  queue
              to be used (see <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5) for details).

       <u>script_from_stdin</u>
              Setting  the <b>shell_start_mode</b> parameter either to <u>posix_compliant</u> or <u>unix_behavior</u> requires you to
              set the umask in use for <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) such that every user has  read  access  to  the  active_jobs
              directory  in  the  spool directory of the corresponding execution daemon. In case you have <b>prolog</b>
              and <b>epilog</b> scripts configured, they also need to be readable by any user who may execute jobs.
              If this  violates  your  site's  security  policies  you  may  want  to  set  <b>shell_start_mode</b>  to
              <u>script_from_stdin</u>.  This  will  force Grid Engine to open the job script as well as the epilog and
              prolog scripts for reading into STDIN as  root  (if  <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8)  was  started  as  root)  before
              changing  to  the  job  owner's user account.  The script is then fed into the STDIN stream of the
              command interpreter indicated by the <b>-S</b> option of the <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1) command or the  <b>shell</b>  parameter  of
              the queue to be used (see <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5) for details).
              Thus  setting  <b>shell_start_mode</b>  to <u>script_from_stdin</u> also implies <u>posix_compliant</u> behavior. <b>Note</b>,
              however, that feeding scripts into the STDIN stream of a command interpreter may cause trouble  if
              commands  like <u><a href="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh</a></u>(1) are invoked inside a job script as they also process the STDIN stream of the
              command interpreter. These problems can usually be resolved by redirecting the  STDIN  channel  of
              those  commands  to  come  from  /dev/null  (e.g.  rsh host date &lt; /dev/null). <b>Note</b> <b>also</b>, that any
              command-line options associated with the job are passed to the executing  shell.  The  shell  will
              only forward them to the job if they are not recognized as valid shell options.

       Changes   to   <b>shell_start_mode</b>  will  take  immediate  effect.   The  default  for  <b>shell_start_mode</b>  is
       <u>posix_compliant</u>.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>login_shells</b>
       UNIX command interpreters like the Bourne-Shell (see <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1)) or the C-Shell (see <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1)) can  be  used  by
       Grid  Engine  to  start job scripts. The command interpreters can either be started as login-shells (i.e.
       all system and user default resource files like .login or .profile will  be  executed  when  the  command
       interpreter is started, and the environment for the job will be set up as if the user has just logged in)
       or just for command execution (i.e. only shell-specific resource files like .cshrc will be executed and a
       minimal default environment is set up by Grid Engine - see <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1)).  The parameter <b>login_shells</b> contains
       a comma-separated list of the executable names of the command interpreters to be started as login shells.
       Shells in this list are only started as login shells if the parameter <b>shell_start_mode</b> (see above) is set
       to <u>posix_compliant</u>.

       Changes   to   <b>login_shells</b>   will   take   immediate   effect.    The   default   for   <b>login_shells</b>  is
       sh,bash,csh,tcsh,ksh.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>min_uid</b>
       <b>min_uid</b> places a lower bound on user IDs that may use the cluster. Users whose user ID  (as  returned  by
       <u><a href="../man3/getpwnam.3.html">getpwnam</a></u>(3)) is less than <b>min_uid</b> will not be allowed to run jobs on the cluster.

       Changes  to <b>min_uid</b> will take immediate effect.  The default is 0 but, if CSP or MUNGE security is not in
       use, the installation script sets it to 100 to prevent unauthorized access by root or system accounts.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>min_gid</b>
       This parameter sets the lower bound on group IDs that may use the cluster.  Users whose default group  ID
       (as returned by <u><a href="../man3/getpwnam.3.html">getpwnam</a></u>(3)) is less than <b>min_gid</b> will not be allowed to run jobs on the cluster.

       Changes  to <b>min_gid</b> will take immediate effect.  The default is 0 but, if CSP security is not in use, the
       installation script sets it to 100 to prevent unauthorized access by root or system accounts.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>user_lists</b>
       The <b>user_lists</b>  parameter  contains  a  comma-separated  list  of  user  access  lists  as  described  in
       <u><a href="../man5/access_list.5.html">access_list</a></u>(5).   Each  user  contained in at least one of the access lists has access to the cluster. If
       the <b>user_lists</b> parameter is set to NONE (the default) any user has access if not explicitly excluded  via
       the <b>xuser_lists</b> parameter described below.  If a user is contained both in an access list <b>xuser_lists</b> and
       <b>user_lists</b>, the user is denied access to the cluster.

       Changes to <b>user_lists</b> will take immediate effect.

       This  value  is a global configuration parameter insofar as it restricts access to the whole cluster, but
       the execution host local configuration may define a value to restrict access to that host further.

   <b>xuser_lists</b>
       The <b>xuser_lists</b> parameter  contains  a  comma-separated  list  of  user  access  lists  as  described  in
       <u><a href="../man5/access_list.5.html">access_list</a></u>(5).  Each user contained in at least one of the access lists is denied access to the cluster.
       If  the  <b>xuser_lists</b>  parameter is set to NONE (the default) any user has access.  If a user is contained
       both in an access list in <b>xuser_lists</b> and <b>user_lists</b> (see  above)  the  user  is  denied  access  to  the
       cluster.

       Changes to <b>xuser_lists</b> will take immediate effect.

       This  value  is a global configuration parameter insofar as it restricts access to the whole cluster, but
       the execution host local configuration may define a value to restrict access to that host further.

   <b>administrator_mail</b>
       <b>administrator_mail</b> specifies a comma-separated list of the electronic mail  address(es)  of  the  cluster
       administrator(s)  to  whom internally-generated problem reports are sent. The mail address format depends
       on your electronic mail system and how it is configured; consult your system's  configuration  guide  for
       more information.

       Changing  <b>administrator_mail</b> takes immediate effect.  The default for <b>administrator_mail</b> is an empty mail
       list.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>projects</b>
       The <b>projects</b> list contains all projects which are granted access to Grid Engine. Users not  belonging  to
       one  of  these  projects  cannot  submit  jobs.  If users belong to projects in the <b>projects</b> list and the
       <b>xprojects</b> list (see below), they also cannot submit jobs.

       Changing <b>projects</b> takes immediate effect.  The default for <b>projects</b> is none.

       While globally-configured projects affect job submission, projects configured for queues or hosts  affect
       job execution in the appropriate context.

   <b>xprojects</b>
       The <b>xprojects</b> list contains all projects that are denied access to Grid Engine. Users belonging to one of
       these  projects  cannot use Grid Engine. If users belong to projects in the <b>projects</b> list (see above) and
       the <b>xprojects</b> list, they also cannot use the system.

       Changing <b>xprojects</b> takes immediate effect.  The default for <b>xprojects</b> is none.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>load_report_time</b>
       System load is  reported  periodically  by  the  execution  daemons  to  <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8).   The  parameter
       <b>load_report_time</b> defines the time interval between load reports.

       Each  <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8)  may  use  a different load report time. Changing <b>load_report_time</b> will take immediate
       effect.

       <b>Note:</b>  Be  careful  when  modifying  <b>load_report_time</b>.  Reporting  load  too   frequently   might   block
       <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8)  especially  if  the  number  of execution hosts is large. Moreover, since the system load
       typically increases and decreases smoothly, frequent load reports hardly offer any benefit.

       The default for <b>load_report_time</b> is 40 seconds.

       The global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be  overwritten  by  the  execution  host  local
       configuration.

   <b>reschedule_unknown</b>
       Determines whether jobs on hosts in an unknown state are rescheduled, and thus sent to other hosts. Hosts
       are  registered  as  unknown if <u><a href="../man8/sge_master.8.html">sge_master</a></u>(8) cannot establish contact to the <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) on those hosts
       (see <b>max_unheard</b>).  Likely reasons are a breakdown of the host or a breakdown of the  network  connection
       in between, but also <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) may not be executing on such hosts.

       In any case, Grid Engine can reschedule jobs running on such hosts to another system.  <b>reschedule_unknown</b>
       controls  the  time  which Grid Engine will wait before jobs are rescheduled after a host became unknown.
       The time format specification is hh:mm:ss. If the special value 00:00:00 is set, then jobs  will  not  be
       rescheduled from this host.

       Rescheduling  is  only  initiated  for  jobs  which have activated the rerun flag (see the <b>-r</b> <b>y</b> option of
       <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1) and the <b>rerun</b> option of <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5)).  Parallel jobs are only rescheduled if the host on  which
       their  master task executes is in unknown state. The behavior of <b>reschedule_unknown</b> for parallel jobs and
       for  jobs  without  the  rerun  flag  set   can   be   adjusted   using   the   <b>qmaster_params</b>   settings
       <b>ENABLE_RESCHEDULE_KILL</b> and <b>ENABLE_RESCHEDULE_SLAVE.</b>

       Checkpointing  jobs  will  only  be  rescheduled  when the <b>when</b> option of the corresponding checkpointing
       environment contains an appropriate flag. (see <u><a href="../man5/checkpoint.5.html">checkpoint</a></u>(5)).  Interactive jobs  (see  <u><a href="../man1/qsh.1.html">qsh</a></u>(1),  <u><a href="../man1/qrsh.1.html">qrsh</a></u>(1),
       <u><a href="../man1/qtcsh.1.html">qtcsh</a></u>(1)) are not rescheduled.

       The default for <b>reschedule_unknown</b> is 00:00:00

       The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be  overwritten  by  the  execution  host local
       configuration.

   <b>max_unheard</b>
       If <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8) could not contact, or was not  contacted  by,  the  execution  daemon  of  a  host  for
       <b>max_unheard</b>   seconds,  all  queues  residing  on  that  particular  host  are  set  to  status  unknown.
       <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8), at least, should be contacted by the execution daemons in order to get the load  reports.
       Thus, <b>max_unheard</b> should be greater than the <b>load_report_time</b> (see above).

       Changing <b>max_unheard</b> takes immediate effect.  The default for <b>max_unheard</b> is 5 minutes.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>loglevel</b>
       This  parameter  specifies  the  level  of  detail  that Grid Engine components such as <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8) or
       <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) use to produce informative, warning or error messages which are logged to the <u>messages</u> files
       in the master and execution  daemon  spool  directories  (see  the  description  of  the  <b>execd_spool_dir</b>
       parameter above). The following message levels are available:

       <u>log_err</u>
              All error events recognized are logged.

       <u>log_warning</u>
              All error events recognized, and all detected signs of potentially erroneous behavior, are logged.

       <u>log_info</u>
              All  error  events recognized, all detected signs of potentially erroneous behavior, and a variety
              of informative messages are logged.

       Changing <b>loglevel</b> will take immediate effect.

       The default for <b>loglevel</b> is <u>log_warning</u>.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>max_aj_instances</b>
       This parameter defines the maximum number of array tasks to be scheduled to run simultaneously per  array
       job.   An  instance  of an array task will be created within the master daemon when it gets a start order
       from the scheduler. The instance will be destroyed when the array  task  finishes.   Thus  the  parameter
       provides control mainly over the memory consumption of array jobs in the master daemon. It is most useful
       for  very  large clusters and very large array jobs.  The default for this parameter is 2000. The value 0
       will deactivate this limit and will allow the scheduler to start as many  array  job  tasks  as  suitable
       resources are available in the cluster.

       Changing <b>max_aj_instances</b> will take immediate effect.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>max_aj_tasks</b>
       This  parameter  defines  the maximum number of array job tasks within an array job.  <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8) will
       reject all array job submissions which request more than <b>max_aj_tasks</b> array job tasks.  The  default  for
       this parameter is 75000. The value 0 will deactivate this limit.

       Changing <b>max_aj_tasks</b> will take immediate effect.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>max_u_jobs</b>
       The  number  of  active  (not  finished)  jobs  which  each  Grid  Engine  user  can  have  in the system
       simultaneously is controlled by this parameter. A value greater than 0 defines  the  limit.  The  default
       value  0  means  "unlimited". If the <b>max_u_jobs</b> limit is exceeded by a job submission then the submission
       command exits with exit status 25 and an appropriate error message.

       Changing <b>max_u_jobs</b> will take immediate effect.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>max_jobs</b>
       The number of active (not finished) jobs simultaneously allowed in Grid  Engine  is  controlled  by  this
       parameter.  A  value  greater  than  0  defines the limit.  The default value 0 means "unlimited". If the
       <b>max_jobs</b> limit is exceeded by a job submission then the submission command exits with exit status 25  and
       an appropriate error message.

       Changing <b>max_jobs</b> will take immediate effect.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>max_advance_reservations</b>
       The  number  of  active  (not  finished)  Advance  Reservations  simultaneously allowed in Grid Engine is
       controlled by this parameter. A value greater than 0  defines  the  limit.  The  default  value  0  means
       "unlimited". If the <b>max_advance_reservations</b> limit is exceeded by an Advance Reservation request then the
       submission command exits with exit status 25 and an appropriate error message.

       Changing <b>max_advance_reservations</b> will take immediate effect.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>enforce_project</b>
       If  set  to <u>true</u>, users are required to request a project whenever submitting a job. See the <b>-P</b> option to
       <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1) for details.

       Changing <b>enforce_project</b> will take immediate effect.  The default for <b>enforce_project</b> is <u>false</u>.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>enforce_user</b>
       If set to <u>true</u>, a <u><a href="../man5/user.5.html">user</a></u>(5) must exist to allow for job submission. Jobs are rejected if  no  corresponding
       user exists.

       If  set  to  <u>auto</u>,  a  <u><a href="../man5/user.5.html">user</a></u>(5)  object  for  the submitting user will automatically be created during job
       submission,   if   one   does   not   already    exist.    The    <b>auto_user_oticket</b>,    <b>auto_user_fshare</b>,
       <b>auto_user_default_project</b>,  and  <b>auto_user_delete_time</b>  configuration  parameters will be used as default
       attributes of the new <u><a href="../man5/user.5.html">user</a></u>(5) object.

       Changing <b>enforce_user</b> will take immediate effect.  The default for <b>enforce_user</b> is <u>auto</u>.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>auto_user_oticket</b>
       The number of override tickets to assign to automatically  created  <u><a href="../man5/user.5.html">user</a></u>(5)  objects.  User  objects  are
       created automatically if the <b>enforce_user</b> attribute is set to <u>auto</u>.

       Changing  <b>auto_user_oticket</b>  will affect any newly created user objects, but will not change user objects
       created in the past.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>auto_user_fshare</b>
       The number of functional shares to assign to automatically created  <u><a href="../man5/user.5.html">user</a></u>(5)  objects.  User  objects  are
       created automatically if the <b>enforce_user</b> attribute is set to <u>auto</u>.

       Changing  <b>auto_user_fshare</b>  will  affect any newly created user objects, but will not change user objects
       created in the past.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>auto_user_default_project</b>
       The default project to assign  to  automatically  created  <u><a href="../man5/user.5.html">user</a></u>(5)  objects.  User  objects  are  created
       automatically if the <b>enforce_user</b> attribute is set to <u>auto</u>.

       Changing  <b>auto_user_default_project</b>  will affect any newly created user objects, but will not change user
       objects created in the past.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>auto_user_delete_time</b>
       The number of seconds of inactivity after which automatically created <u><a href="../man5/user.5.html">user</a></u>(5) objects  will  be  deleted.
       User  objects  are created automatically if the <b>enforce_user</b> attribute is set to <u>auto</u>. If the user has no
       active or pending jobs for the specified amount of time, the object will  automatically  be  deleted.   A
       value of 0 can be used to indicate that the automatically created user object is permanent and should not
       be automatically deleted.

       Changing <b>auto_user_delete_time</b> will affect the deletion time for all users with active jobs.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>set_token_cmd</b>
       <b>NB.</b>   <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>qmaster</b> <b>spool</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> <b>world-readable</b> <b>for</b> <b>non-admin</b> <b>users,</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>take</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>encrypt</b> <b>the</b>
       <b>credentials,</b> <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>there</b> <b>after</b> <b>job</b> <b>submission.</b>
       <b>Set_token_cmd</b> points to a command which sets and extends AFS tokens for Grid Engine jobs.  It is  run  by
       <u><a href="../man8/sge_coshepherd.8.html">sge_coshepherd</a></u>(8).  It expects two command line parameters:

              &lt;set_token_cmd&gt; &lt;user&gt; &lt;token_extend_after_seconds&gt;
       It  reads  the  token  from STDIN, extends its expiration time, and re-sets the token.  As a shell script
       this command will call the programs:

              - SetToken
              - forge

       which are provided by your distributor as source code. The script looks as follows:

              --------------------------------
              #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
              # set_token_cmd
              forge -u $1 -t $2 | SetToken
              --------------------------------

       Since it is necessary for <u>forge</u> to read the secret AFS server key, a  site  might  wish  to  replace  the
       <b>set_token_cmd</b> script by a command, which connects to a custom daemon at the AFS server. The token must be
       forged at the AFS server and returned to the local machine, where <u>SetToken</u> is executed.

       Changing <b>set_token_cmd</b> will take immediate effect.  The default for <b>set_token_cmd</b> is none.

       The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be  overwritten  by  the  execution  host local
       configuration.

   <b>pag_cmd</b>
       The path to your <u>pagsh</u> is specified via this parameter.  The <u><a href="../man8/sge_shepherd.8.html">sge_shepherd</a></u>(8) process and the job run in a
       <u>pagsh</u>. Please ask your AFS administrator for details.

       Changing <b>pag_cmd</b> will take immediate effect.  The default for <b>pag_cmd</b> is none.

       The global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be  overwritten  by  the  execution  host  local
       configuration.

   <b>token_extend_time</b>
       The <b>token_extend_time</b> is the time period for which AFS tokens are periodically extended. Grid Engine will
       call  the  token  extension  30  minutes  before  the  tokens  expire  until  jobs  have finished and the
       corresponding tokens are no longer required.

       Changing <b>token_extend_time</b> will take immediate effect.  The default for <b>token_extend_time</b> is 24:0:0, i.e.
       24 hours.

       The global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be  overwritten  by  the  execution  host  local
       configuration.

   <b>shepherd_cmd</b>
       Alternative  path  to  the  <b>shepherd_cmd</b>  binary. Typically used to call the shepherd binary by a wrapper
       script or command.  If used in production, this must take care to handle signals  the  way  the  shepherd
       would or, for instance, jobs will not be killed correctly.

       Changing <b>shepherd_cmd</b> will take immediate effect. The default for <b>shepherd_cmd</b> is none.

       The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be  overwritten  by  the  execution  host local
       configuration.

   <b>gid_range</b>
       The <b>gid_range</b> is a comma-separated list of range expressions of the form <u>m</u><b>-</b><u>n</u>, where <u>m</u> and <u>n</u>  are  integer
       numbers  greater  than  99,  and <u>m</u> is an abbreviation for <u>m</u><b>-</b><u>m</u>.  These numbers are used in <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) to
       identify processes belonging to the same job.

       Each <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) may use a separate set of group ids for this purpose.  All  numbers  in  the  group  id
       range have to be unused supplementary group ids on the system, where the <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) is started.

       Changing <b>gid_range</b> will take immediate effect.  There is no default for <b>gid_range</b>. The administrator will
       have to assign a value for <b>gid_range</b> during installation of Grid Engine.

       The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be  overwritten  by  the  execution  host local
       configuration.

   <b>qmaster_params</b>
       A list of additional parameters can be passed to the  Grid  Engine  qmaster.  The  following  values  are
       recognized:

       <u>ENABLE_ENFORCE_MASTER_LIMIT</u>
              If  this  parameter  is set then the <b>s_rt</b>, <b>h_rt</b> limits of a running job are tested and acted on by
              the <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8) when the <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) where the job was run is in an unknown state.

              After the <b>s_rt</b> or <b>h_rt</b> limit of a job is expired, the master  daemon  will  wait  additional  time
              defined by <b>DURATION_OFFSET</b> (see <u><a href="../man5/sched_conf.5.html">sched_conf</a></u>(5)).  If the execution daemon still cannot be contacted
              when  this  additional  time is elapsed, then the master daemon will force the deletion of the job
              (see <b>-f</b> of <u><a href="../man1/qdel.1.html">qdel</a></u>(1)).

              For jobs which will be deleted that way, an accounting record will be  created.   For  usage,  the
              record  will  contain  the  last  reported  online  value  when the execution daemon could contact
              qmaster. The <b>failed</b> state in the record will be set to 37 to indicate that the job was  terminated
              by a limit enforced by the master daemon.

              After  the  restart  of  <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8)  the  limit  enforcement will be triggered after twice the
              biggest <b>load_report_interval</b> interval defined in <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5)  has  elapsed.  This  will  give  the
              execution daemons enough time to re-register with the master daemon.

       <u>ENABLE_FORCED_QDEL_IF_UNKNOWN</u>
              If  this  parameter  is  set  then  a deletion request for a job is automatically interpreted as a
              forced deletion request (see <b>-f</b> of <u><a href="../man1/qdel.1.html">qdel</a></u>(1)) if the host where the job is running is in an  unknown
              state.

       <u>ENABLE_FORCED_QDEL</u>
              If this parameter is set, non-administrative users can force deletion of their own jobs via the <u>-f</u>
              option  of  <u><a href="../man1/qdel.1.html">qdel</a></u>(1).   Without this parameter, forced deletion of jobs is only allowed by the Grid
              Engine manager or operator.

              <b>Note:</b> Forced deletion for jobs is executed differently, depending on whether users are Grid Engine
              administrators or not. In the case of administrative users, the jobs are removed from the internal
              database of Grid Engine immediately. For regular users, the equivalent  of  a  normal  <u><a href="../man1/qdel.1.html">qdel</a></u>(1)  is
              executed first, and deletion is forced only if the normal cancellation was unsuccessful.

       <u>FORBID_RESCHEDULE</u>
              If this parameter is set, re-queueing of jobs cannot be initiated by the job script which is under
              control of the user. Without this parameter, jobs returning the value 99 are rescheduled. This can
              be  used  to  cause  the job to be restarted on a different machine, for instance if there are not
              enough resources on the current one.

       <u>FORBID_APPERROR</u>
              If this parameter is set, the application cannot set itself to  the  error  state.   Without  this
              parameter  jobs  returning the value 100 are set to the error state (and therefore can be manually
              rescheduled by clearing the error state).  This can be used to set the job to the error state when
              a starting condition of the application is not fulfilled before the application  itself  has  been
              started, or when a clean up procedure (e.g. in the epilog) decides that it is necessary to run the
              job again.  To do so, return 100 in the prolog, pe_start, job script, pe_stop or epilog script.

       <u>DISABLE_AUTO_RESCHEDULING</u>
              <b>Note:</b> Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
              If set to "true" or "1", the <u>reschedule_unknown</u> parameter is not taken into account.

       <u>ENABLE_RESCHEDULE_KILL</u>
              If  set  to "true" or "1", the <u>reschedule_unknown</u> parameter affects also jobs which have the rerun
              flag not activated (see the <b>-r</b> <b>y</b> option of <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1) and the <b>rerun</b>  option  of  <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5)),  but
              they are just finished as they can't be rescheduled.

       <u>ENABLE_RESCHEDULE_SLAVE</u>
              If  set  to "true" or "1" Grid Engine triggers job rescheduling also when the host where the slave
              tasks of a parallel job executes is in unknown  state,  if  the  <u>reschedule_unknown</u>  parameter  is
              activated.

       <u>MAX_DYN_EC</u>
              Sets the max number of dynamic event clients (as used by <b>qsub</b> <b>-sync</b> <b>y</b> and by Grid Engine DRMAA API
              library  sessions). The default is 1000.  The number of dynamic event clients should not be bigger
              than half of the number of file descriptors the system has. The number  of  file  descriptors  are
              shared  among  the  connections  to  all  exec hosts, all event clients, and file handles that the
              qmaster needs.

       <u>MONITOR_TIME</u>
              Specifies the time interval when the monitoring information should be printed. The  monitoring  is
              disabled  by  default  and can be enabled by specifying an interval.  The monitoring is per-thread
              and is written  to  the  messages  file  or  displayed  by  <u><a href="../man1/qping.1.html">qping</a></u>(1)  with  option  <b>-f</b>.   Example:
              MONITOR_TIME=0:0:10  generates  and  prints  the  monitoring  information  approximately  every 10
              seconds. The specified time is a guideline only and not a fixed interval.  The  interval  that  is
              actually  used  is printed.  In this example, the interval could be anything between 9 seconds and
              20 seconds.

       <u>LOG_MONITOR_MESSAGE</u>
              Monitoring information is logged into the messages files  by  default.  This  information  can  be
              accessed  via  by  <u><a href="../man1/qping.1.html">qping</a></u>(1).  If monitoring is always enabled, the messages files can become quite
              large.  This switch disables logging into the messages files, making <u>qping</u> <u>-f</u> the only  source  of
              monitoring data.

       Profiling  provides  the  user  with  the possibility to get system measurements.  This can be useful for
       debugging or optimization of the system. The profiling output will be done within the messages file.

       <u>PROF_SIGNAL</u>
              Enables profiling for the qmaster signal thread (e.g. PROF_SIGNAL=true).

       <u>PROF_WORKER</u>
              Enables profiling for the qmaster worker threads (e.g. PROF_WORKER=true).

       <u>PROF_LISTENER</u>
              Enables profiling for the qmaster listener threads (e.g. PROF_LISTENER=true).

       <u>PROF_DELIVER</u>
              Enables profiling for the qmaster event deliver thread (e.g. PROF_DELIVER=true).

       <u>PROF_TEVENT</u>
              Enables the profiling for the qmaster timed event thread (e.g. PROF_TEVENT=true).

       <u>PROF_SCHEDULER</u>
              Enables profiling for the qmaster scheduler thread (e.g. PROF_SCHEDULER=true).

       Please note that the CPU utime and stime values contained in the profiling output are not per-thread  CPU
       times.   These  CPU usage statistics are per-process statistics.  So the printed profiling values for CPU
       mean "CPU time consumed by sge_qmaster (all threads) while the reported profiling level was active".

       <u>STREE_SPOOL_INTERVAL</u>
              Sets the time interval for spooling the sharetree usage. The  default  is  set  to  00:04:00.  The
              setting  accepts  colon-separated  string  or  seconds.  There is no setting to turn the sharetree
              spooling off.  (e.g. STREE_SPOOL_INTERVAL=00:02:00)

       <u>MAX_JOB_DELETION_TIME</u>
              Sets the value of how long the qmaster will spend deleting jobs. After this time, the qmaster will
              continue with other tasks and schedule the deletion of remaining jobs at a later time. The default
              value is 3 seconds, and will be used if no value is entered. The range of valid values is &gt; 0  and
              &lt;= 5.  (e.g. MAX_JOB_DELETION_TIME=1)

       <u>gdi_timeout</u>
              Sets  how  long  the  communication  will  wait for GDI send/receive operations.  (GDI is the Grid
              Engine Database Interface for interacting with objects managed by the qmaster.)  The default value
              is set to 60 seconds. After this time, the communication library will retry, if  "gdi_retries"  is
              configured, receiving the GDI request. If not configured the communication will return with a "gdi
              receive  failure"  (e.g.  gdi_timeout=120  will  set the timeout time to 120 sec).  Configuring no
              gdi_timeout value, the value defaults to 60 sec.

       <u>gdi_retries</u>
              Sets how often the GDI receive call will be repeated until the  GDI  receive  error  appears.  The
              default  is  set to 0. In this case the call will be done 1 time with no retry.  Setting the value
              to -1 the call will be done permanently. In combination  with  the  gdi_timeout  parameter  it  is
              possible  to configure a system with, e.g. slow NFS, to make sure that all jobs will be submitted.
              (E.g. gdi_retries=4.)

       <u>cl_ping</u>
              Turns on/off a communication library ping. This parameter will  create  additional  debug  output.
              This  output shows information about the error messages which are returned by communication and it
              will give information about the application status of the qmaster.  For example, if  it's  unclear
              what's  the  reason for gdi timeouts, this may show you some useful messages. The default value is
              false (off) (i.e. cl_ping=false).

       <u>SCHEDULER_TIMEOUT</u>
              Setting this parameter  allows  the  scheduler  GDI  event  acknowledge  timeout  to  be  manually
              configured  to  a  specific  value.  Currently  the  default  value is 10 minutes with the default
              scheduler configuration and limited between 600 and 1200 seconds.  Value is limited only  in  case
              of  default  value.   The  default  value  depends  on  the  current  scheduler configuration. The
              <u>SCHEDULER_TIMEOUT</u> value is specified in seconds.

       <u>jsv_timeout</u>
              This parameter measures the response time of the server JSV. In the event that the  response  time
              of  the  JSV is longer than the timeout value specified, this will cause the JSV to be re-started.
              The default value for the timeout is 10 seconds and if modified, must be greater than  0.  If  the
              timeout  is  reached,  the JSV will only try to re-start once; if the timeout is reached again, an
              error will occur.

       <u>jsv_threshold</u>
              The threshold of a JSV is measured as the time it takes to perform a server job  verification.  If
              this  value is greater than the user-defined value, it will cause logging to appear in the qmaster
              messages file at the INFO level. By setting this value to 0,  all  jobs  will  be  logged  in  the
              qmaster messages file. This value is specified in milliseconds and has a default value of 5000.

       <u>OLD_RESCHEDULE_BEHAVIOR</u>
              Beginning  with  version  8.0.0  of  Grid Engine the scheduling behavior changed for jobs that are
              rescheduled by users. Rescheduled jobs will not be put at the beginning of the  pending  job  list
              anymore.  The  submit  time of those jobs is set to the end time of the previous run. Due to that,
              those rescheduled jobs will be appended to the  pending  job  list  as  if  a  new  job  had  been
              submitted.  To  achieve  the old behaviour, set the parameter <u>OLD_RESCHEDULE_BEHAVIOR</u>. Please note
              that this parameter is deprecated, so it might be removed with the next minor release.

       <u>OLD_RESCHEDULE_BEHAVIOR_ARRAY_JOB</u>
              Beginning with version 8.0.0 of Grid Engine the scheduling behavior changed for  array  job  tasks
              that  are  rescheduled  by  users.  As  soon  as an array job task gets rescheduled, all remaining
              pending tasks of that job will be put at the end of the pending  job  list.  To  achieve  the  old
              scheduling  behaviour  set  the parameter <u>OLD_RESCHEDULE_BEHAVIOR_ARRAY_JOB</u>. Please note that this
              parameter is deprecated, so it might be removed with the next minor release.

       <u>SIMULATE_EXECDS</u>
              Bypass execd communication in qmaster for (e.g. for throughput tests with fake hosts).   "Unknown"
              queue  states  are suppressed, but <b>load_thresholds=none</b> must be used to avoid queues going into an
              alarm state since load values are not simulated.  Submitted jobs are dispatched,  and  act  as  if
              they  are  run  for  a  time  determined  by  the  job's  first  argument,  after  3s spent in the
              "transferring" state.  I.e. there is a simulated 10s runtime for a command such as
                 qsub -b y sleep 10
              In this condition, job deletion works, but at least interactive jobs, tightly-integrated  parallel
              ones,  and  job  suspension  don't.   The execution hosts configured need not exist, but must have
              resolvable network names.

       <u>NO_AUTHENTICATION</u>
              Don't do authentication when GSSAPI security is  enabled.   This,  and  the  following  parameter,
              determine  the  GSS  global  configuration,  which  can be overridden with the execd_params of the
              global or host-specific configuration.

       <u>NO_SECURITY</u>
              Don't store and forward credentials if GSSAPI security is enabled.

       <u>ENABLE_MTRACE</u>
              If GNU malloc is in use (rather then jemalloc, which is usually  used  on  GNU/Linux)  enable  the
              facility for recording all memory allocation/deallocation.  Requires <u>MALLOC_TRACE</u> to be set in the
              environment (see <u><a href="../man3/mtrace.3.html">mtrace</a></u>(3)).

       <b>__</b><u>TEST_SLEEP_AFTER_REQUEST</u>
              Used  by  the  test  suite to block the worker thread for five seconds after handling a request to
              ensure another worker thread will handle a subsequent request.

       <u>print_malloc_info</u>
              Allow monitoring <u><a href="../man3/malloc.3.html">malloc</a></u>(3) statistics if Grid Engine is built to use the <u>jemalloc</u>((3))  allocator.
              The  information  is  usually  obtained with the <b>-info</b> option of <u><a href="../man1/qping.1.html">qping</a></u>(1), but is generated by the
              daemons and can't be controlled by the client.  The default is false since the output  is  verbose
              and  might  confuse  programs  parsing  the  traditional format.  The parameter can also be set in
              <b>execd_params</b> and affects both qmaster and execd daemons.

       Changing <b>qmaster_params</b> will take immediate effect, except that  gdi_timeout,  gdi_retries,  and  cl_ping
       will take effect only for new connections.  The default for <b>qmaster_params</b> is none.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>execd_params</b>
       This  is used for passing additional parameters to the Grid Engine execution daemon. The following values
       are recognized:

       <u>ACCT_RESERVED_USAGE</u>
              If this parameter is set to true, the usage of "reserved" (allocated) resources is reported in the
              accounting entries <b>cpu</b>, <b>mem</b>, and <b>maxvmem</b> instead of the measured usage.   The  live  usage  values
              reported by <u><a href="../man1/qstat.1.html">qstat</a></u>(1) are affected similarly.  This means that the "wall clock" time (end-start) is
              reported  instead  of  CPU time, memory usage is memory allocation times wall clock time (which is
              only computable if the job requests h_vmem or s_vmem), and maxvmem  is  the  requested  h_vmem  or
              s_vmem; the same scaling by slots is done as without this option.
              Note  that  both  the wall clock and CPU times are normally available (see <u><a href="../man5/accounting.5.html">accounting</a></u>(5)), so this
              option loses information, and "reserved" here has nothing to do with advance/resource reservation.
              See also <u>SHARETREE_RESERVED_USAGE</u> below.

       <u>ENABLE_WINDOMACC</u>
              If this parameter is set to true, Windows Domain accounts (WinDomAcc) are used on  Windows  hosts.
              These  accounts  require  the use of <u><a href="../man1/sgepasswd.1.html">sgepasswd</a></u>(1).  (See also <u><a href="../man5/sgepasswd.5.html">sgepasswd</a></u>(5).)  If this parameter is
              set to false, or is not set,  local  Windows  accounts  are  used.   On  non-Windows  hosts,  this
              parameter is ignored.

       <u>IGNORE_NGROUPS_MAX_LIMIT</u>
              If  a  user  is assigned to NGROUPS_MAX-1 supplementary groups, so that Grid Engine is not able to
              add one for job tracking, then  the  job  will  go  into  an  error  state  when  it  is  started.
              (NGROUPS_MAX  is  the system limit on supplementary groups; see <u><a href="../man7/limits.h.7.html">limits.h</a></u>(7).)  Administrators that
              want to prevent the system doing so can set this parameter.  In this case the NGROUPS_MAX limit is
              ignored and the additional group (see <u>gid_range</u>) is not set. As a result for those jobs no  online
              usage  will  be available. Also the parameter <u>ENABLE_ADDGRP_KILL</u> will have no effect.  Please note
              that it is not recommended to use this parameter. Instead the group membership of the submit  user
              should be reduced.

       <u>KEEP_ACTIVE</u>
              This  value  should  only be set for debugging purposes. If set to true, the execution daemon will
              not remove the spool directory maintained by <u><a href="../man8/sge_shepherd.8.html">sge_shepherd</a></u>(8) for a job, or cgroup  directories  if
              cgroups are in use under Linux.

       <u>PTF_MIN_PRIORITY</u>, <u>PTF_MAX_PRIORITY</u>
              The  maximum/minimum  priority  which  Grid  Engine  will  assign  to  a job.  Typically this is a
              negative/positive value in the range of -20 (maximum) to 19  (minimum)  for  systems  which  allow
              setting of priorities with the <u><a href="../man2/nice.2.html">nice</a></u>(2) system call. Other systems may provide different ranges.
              The  default  priority  range (which varies from system to system) is installed either by removing
              the parameters, or by setting a value of -999.
              See the "messages" file of the execution daemon for the predefined default value  on  your  hosts.
              The values are logged during the startup of the execution daemon.

       <u>PROF_EXECD</u>
              Enables the profiling for the execution daemon (e.g. PROF_EXECD=true).

       <u>NOTIFY_KILL</u>
              This  parameter  allows  you  to  change  the  notification signal for the signal SIGKILL (see the
              <u>-notify</u> option of <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1)).  The parameter either accepts signal  names  (use  the  <u>-l</u>  option  of
              <u><a href="../man1/kill.1.html">kill</a></u>(1))  or the special value <u>none</u>. If set to <u>none</u>, no notification signal will be sent. If it is
              set to <u>TERM</u>, for instance, or  another  signal  name,  then  this  signal  will  be  sent  as  the
              notification signal.

       <u>NOTIFY_SUSP</u>
              With  this  parameter it is possible to modify the notification signal for the signal SIGSTOP (see
              the <u>-notify</u> parameter of <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1)).  The parameter either accepts signal names (use the  <u>-l</u>  option
              of  <u><a href="../man1/kill.1.html">kill</a></u>(1)) or the special value <u>none</u>. If set to <u>none</u>, no notification signal will be sent. If it
              is set to <u>TSTP</u>, for  instance,  or  another  signal  name,  then  this  signal  will  be  sent  as
              notification signal.

       <u>SHARETREE_RESERVED_USAGE</u>
              If  this  parameter is set to true, the usage of "reserved" resources is taken for the Grid Engine
              share tree consumption instead of measured usage.   See  the  description  of  <u>ACCT_RESERVED_USAGE</u>
              above for details.
              <b>Note:</b>   When   running  tightly  integrated  jobs  with  <u>SHARETREE_RESERVED_USAGE</u>  set,  and  with
              <u>accounting_summary</u> enabled in the parallel environment, reserved usage will only  be  reported  by
              the  master  task of the parallel job.  No per-parallel task usage records will be sent from execd
              to qmaster, which can significantly reduce load on qmaster when running large  tightly  integrated
              parallel jobs.

       <u>USE_QSUB_GID</u>
              If  this  parameter  is set to true, the primary group id  active when a job was submitted will be
              set to become the primary group id for job execution. If the parameter is  not  set,  the  primary
              group id as defined for the job owner in the execution host passwd database is used.
              The  feature  is  only  available  for jobs submitted via <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man1/qrsh.1.html">qrsh</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man1/qmake.1.html">qmake</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/qtcsh.1.html">qtcsh</a></u>(1).
              Also, it only works for <u><a href="../man1/qrsh.1.html">qrsh</a></u>(1) jobs  (and  thus  also  for  <u><a href="../man1/qtcsh.1.html">qtcsh</a></u>(1)  and  <u><a href="../man1/qmake.1.html">qmake</a></u>(1))  if  builtin
              communication  is  used,  or  the rsh and rshd components which are provided with Grid Engine (see
              <u><a href="../man5/remote_startup.5.html">remote_startup</a></u>(5)).

       <u>S_DESCRIPTORS</u>, <u>H_DESCRIPTORS</u>, <u>S_MAXPROC</u>, <u>H_MAXPROC</u>, <u>S_MEMORYLOCKED</u>, <u>H_MEMORYLOCKED</u>, <u>S_LOCKS</u>, <u>H_LOCKS</u>
              Specifies soft and hard resource limits as implemented by the <u><a href="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</a></u>(2) system call.  See  that
              manual  page on your system for more information. These parameters complete the list of limits set
              by the RESOURCE LIMITS parameter of the queue configuration as described in <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5).  Unlike
              the resource limits in the queue configuration, these resource limits are set  for  every  job  on
              this  execution  host.  If  a  value  is  not  specified, the resource limit is inherited from the
              execution daemon process. Because this would lead to unpredictable results if only one limit of  a
              resource is set (soft or hard), the corresponding other limit is set to the same value.
              <u>S_DESCRIPTORS</u>  and  <u>H_DESCRIPTORS</u>  specify  a  value  one greater than the maximum file descriptor
              number that can be opened by any process of a job.
              <u>S_MAXPROC</u> and <u>H_MAXPROC</u> specify the maximum number of processes that can be  created  by  the  job
              user on this execution host.
              <u>S_MEMORYLOCKED</u>  and  <u>H_MEMORYLOCKED</u> specify the maximum number of bytes of virtual memory that may
              be locked into RAM.  This typically needs to be set to "unlimited" for use with openib Infiniband,
              and possibly similar transports.
              <u>S_LOCKS</u> and <u>H_LOCKS</u> specify the maximum number of file locks any process of a job may establish.
              All of these values can be specified using the multiplier letters  k,  K,  m,  M,  g  and  G;  see
              <u><a href="../man1/sge_types.1.html">sge_types</a></u>(1)  for  details.  Limits can be specified as "infinity" to remove limits (if possible),
              per <u><a href="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</a></u>(2).

       <u>INHERIT_ENV</u>
              This parameter indicates whether the shepherd  should  allow  the  environment  inherited  by  the
              execution  daemon  from  the shell that started it to be inherited by the job it's starting.  When
              true, any environment variable that is set in the shell which starts the execution daemon  at  the
              time  the  execution  daemon  is  started  will  be set in the environment of any jobs run by that
              execution daemon, unless the environment variable  is  explicitly  overridden,  such  as  PATH  or
              LOGNAME.  If set to false, each job starts with only the environment variables that are explicitly
              passed on by the execution daemon, such as PATH and LOGNAME.  The default value is true.

       <u>SET_LIB_PATH</u>
              This  parameter tells the execution daemon whether to add the Grid Engine shared library directory
              to the library path of executed jobs.  If set to true, and INHERIT_ENV is also set  to  true,  the
              Grid Engine shared library directory will be prepended to the library path which is inherited from
              the  shell  which  started the execution daemon.  If INHERIT_ENV is set to false, the library path
              will contain only the Grid Engine shared library directory.  If set to false, and  INHERIT_ENV  is
              set  to  true, the library path exported to the job will be the one inherited from the shell which
              started the execution daemon.  If INHERIT_ENV is also set to  false,  the  library  path  will  be
              empty.   After  the  execution  daemon  has set the library path, it may be further altered by the
              shell in which the job is  executed,  or  by  the  job  script  itself.   The  default  value  for
              SET_LIB_PATH is false.

       <u>ENABLE_ADDGRP_KILL</u>
              If  this  parameter  is  set  then Grid Engine uses the supplementary group ids (see <u>gid_range</u>) to
              identify all processes which are to be terminated when a job is deleted, or  when  <u><a href="../man8/sge_shepherd.8.html">sge_shepherd</a></u>(8)
              cleans  up  after  job  termination.   This  currently only works under GNU/Linux, Solaris, Tru64,
              FreeBSD, and Darwin.  The default value is on.  Irrelevant with cpuset  support  (see  USE_CGROUPS
              below).

       <u>PDC_INTERVAL</u>
              This parameter defines the interval (default 1s) between runs of the PDC (Portable Data Collector)
              by  the  execution  daemon. The PDC is responsible for enforcing the resource limits s_cpu, h_cpu,
              s_vmem and h_vmem (see <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5)) and job usage collection.  The parameter can  be  set  to  a
              time_specifier (see <u><a href="../man5/sge_types.5.html">sge_types</a></u>(5)), to <b>PER_LOAD_REPORT</b> or to <b>NEVER</b>.
              If  this  parameter  is  set  to  <b>PER_LOAD_REPORT</b>  the  PDC  is  triggered in the same interval as
              <b>load_report_time</b> (see above). If this parameter is set to <b>NEVER</b> the PDC run  is  never  triggered.
              The default is 1 second.
              <b>Note:</b>  A  PDC run is quite compute intensive, and may degrade the performance of the running jobs.
              However, if the PDC runs less often, or never, the online  usage  can  be  incomplete  or  totally
              missing  (for  example  online usage of very short running jobs might be missing) and the resource
              limit enforcement is less accurate or would not happen if PDC is turned off completely.

       <u>ENABLE_BINDING</u>
              If this parameter is set, then Grid Engine enables the core binding module  within  the  execution
              daemon  to apply binding parameters that are specified at submission time of a job. This parameter
              is set by default if  Grid  Engine  was  compiled  with  support  for  core  binding.   Find  more
              information for job to core binding in the section <u>-binding</u> of <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1).

       <u>SIMULATE_JOBS</u>
              Allow the simulation of jobs.  (Job spooling and execution on the execd side is disabled.)

       <u>NO_AUTHENTICATION</u>
              Turn  off  authentication for the relevant host(s) when the authentication GSSAPI security feature
              is enabled globally.

       <u>DO_AUTHENTICATION</u>
              Turn on authentication for the relevant host(s) when the authentication GSSAPI security feature is
              enabled globally.

       <u>NO_SECURITY</u>
              Turn off storing and forwarding of  credentials  when  the  GSSAPI  security  feature  is  enabled
              globally.

       <u>USE_SYSLOG</u>
              Write messages to the system logger (see <u><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></u>(3)) rather than into the spool directory.

       <u>USE_QIDLE</u>
              Automatically  start  any  executable  named  <u>qidle</u>  present  in the architecture-dependent binary
              directory as a load sensor, similarly to  <u>qloadsensor</u>  (which  is  run  unconditionally).   It  is
              intended  to  determine whether a workstation is "idle" or not, i.e. whether it has an interactive
              load.    See   e.g.   the   idle   time   HOWTO   ⟨<a href="http://arc.liv.ac.uk/SGE/howto/idle.html">http://arc.liv.ac.uk/SGE/howto/idle.html</a>⟩    or
              <u>sources/experimental/qidle</u>  in  the  source  repository,  but  it  may  be better to check the the
              screensaver state.

       <u>USE_CGROUPS</u>
              [Linux only.]  Use cgroups/cpusets for resource management if the system  supports  them  and  the
              necessary    directories    exist    in    the   relevant   filesystems   (possibly   created   by
              <u>util/resources/scripts/setup-cgroups-etc</u>).  Makes ENABLE_ADDGRP_KILL irrelevant.  This  option  is
              experimental, and at least the default is likely to change in future.  Default is no.

       <u>USE_SMAPS</u>
              [Linux  only.]   Read processes' <u>smaps</u> file in the <u><a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</a></u>(5) filesystem to obtain PSS usage for most
              accurate memory accounting, or to obtain the swap usage on older systems which don't  report  PSS.
              That  can  be  slow  when processes have very many maps (observed with an FEM code), significantly
              increasing the load from execd, so the default  is  no.   Without  <u>smaps</u>,  usage  is  reported  as
              RSS+swap, instead of PSS+swap, or simply as the VMsize if the swap value isn't available.

       <u>print_malloc_info</u>
              See <b>qmaster_params</b> above.

       <b>DEMAND_LS</b>
              If  true,  generate  load  sensor  reports just before sending them, making the data fresher.  The
              default is true.  The switch is provided in case slow sensors are found to have a  bad  effect  on
              the execd.

       Changing  <b>execd_params</b>  will take effect after it is propagated to the execution daemons. The propagation
       is done in one load report interval.  The default for <b>execd_params</b> is none.

       The global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be  overwritten  by  the  execution  host  local
       configuration.

   <b>reporting_params</b>
       Used  to  define  the  behavior  of  reporting  modules  in  the  Grid  Engine  qmaster.  Changes  to the
       <b>reporting_params</b> take immediate effect.  The following values are recognized:

       <u>accounting</u>
              If this parameter is set to true, the accounting file  is  written.   The  accounting  file  is  a
              prerequisite for <u><a href="../man1/qacct.1.html">qacct</a></u>(1).

       <u>reporting</u>
              If this parameter is set to true, the reporting file is written.  The reporting file contains data
              that  can  be  used  for  monitoring  and  analysis,  like  job accounting, job log, host load and
              consumables, queue status and consumables, and  sharetree  configuration  and  usage.   Attention:
              Depending  on  the  size  and load of the cluster, the reporting file can become quite large. Only
              activate the reporting file if you have a process running that will consume  the  reporting  file!
              See <u><a href="../man5/reporting.5.html">reporting</a></u>(5) for further information about the format and contents of the reporting file.

       <u>flush_time</u>
              The  contents of the reporting file are buffered in the Grid Engine qmaster and flushed at a fixed
              interval.  This interval can be configured with the <u>flush_time</u> parameter.  It is  specified  as  a
              time  value  in  the  format  HH:MM:SS  or  a number of seconds.  Sensible values range from a few
              seconds to a minute. Setting it too low may slow down the qmaster. Setting it too high  will  make
              the  qmaster consume large amounts of memory for buffering data.  The reporting file is opened and
              closed for each flush.  Default 15s.

       <u>accounting_flush_time</u>
              The contents of the accounting file are buffered in the Grid Engine qmaster and flushed at a fixed
              interval.  This interval can be  configured  with  the  <u>accounting_flush_time</u>  parameter.   It  is
              specified as a time value in the format HH:MM:SS.  Sensible values range from a few seconds to one
              minute.  Setting  it  too low may slow down the qmaster. Setting it too high will make the qmaster
              consume large amounts of memory for buffering data.  Setting it to 0 disables buffering;  as  soon
              as  a  record  is  generated, it will be written to the accounting file.  If this parameter is not
              set, the accounting data flush interval will default to the value  of  the  <u>flush_time</u>  parameter.
              The accounting file is opened and closed for each flush.

       <u>joblog</u> If  this  parameter  is  set to true, the reporting file will contain job logging information. See
              <u><a href="../man5/reporting.5.html">reporting</a></u>(5) for more information about job logging.

       <u>sharelog</u>
              The Grid Engine qmaster can  dump  information  about  sharetree  configuration  and  use  to  the
              reporting  file.   The  parameter <u>sharelog</u> sets an interval in which sharetree information will be
              dumped.  It is set in the format HH:MM:SS  or  a  number  of  seconds.  A  value  of  0  (default)
              configures qmaster not to dump sharetree information. Intervals of several minutes up to hours are
              sensible values for this parameter.  See <u><a href="../man5/reporting.5.html">reporting</a></u>(5) for further information about sharelog.

       <u>log_consumables</u>
              This  parameter  controls  writing  of  consumable  resources  to the reporting file.  When set to
              <b>log_consumables=true</b> information about all consumable resources (their  current  usage  and  their
              capacity)  will be written to the reporting file, whenever a consumable resource changes either in
              definition, or in capacity, or when the usage of an arbitrary consumable resource  changes.   When
              <b>log_consumables</b>  is  set to <b>false</b> (default), only those variables will be written to the reporting
              file that are configured in  the  <b>report_variables</b>  in  the  exec  host  configuration  and  whose
              definition  or  value  actually changed.  This parameter is deprecated and will get removed in the
              next major release.  See <u><a href="../man5/host_conf.5.html">host_conf</a></u>(5) for further information about <b>report_variables</b>.

   <b>finished_jobs</b>
       <b>Note:</b> Deprecated, may be removed in a future release.
       Grid Engine stores a certain number of <u>just</u> <u>finished</u> jobs to provide post mortem status  information  via
       <u>qstat</u>  <u>-s</u>  <u>z</u>.  The <b>finished_jobs</b> parameter defines the number of finished ("zombie") jobs stored. If this
       maximum number is reached, the eldest finished job will be discarded for  every  new  job  added  to  the
       finished job list.  (The zombie list is not spooled, and so will be lost by a qmaster re-start.)

       Changing <b>finished_jobs</b> will take immediate effect.  The default for <b>finished_jobs</b> is 100.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overwritten by the execution host local
       configuration.

   <b>qlogin_daemon</b>
   <b>qlogin_command</b>
   <b>rlogin_daemon</b>
   <b>rlogin_command</b>
   <b>rsh_daemon</b>
   <b>rsh_command</b>
       These  three pairs of entries are responsible for defining a remote startup method for either interactive
       jobs by <u><a href="../man1/qlogin.1.html">qlogin</a></u>(1) or <u><a href="../man1/qrsh.1.html">qrsh</a></u>(1) <b>without</b> a command, or an interactive <u><a href="../man1/qrsh.1.html">qrsh</a></u>(1) request  <b>with</b>  a  command.  The
       last  startup  method  is also used to startup tasks on a slave exechost of a tightly integrated parallel
       job.  Each pair for one startup method must contain  matching  communication  methods.  All  entries  can
       contain  the  value  <b>builtin</b>  (which is the default) or a full path to a binary which should be used, and
       additional arguments to this command if necessary.

       The entries for the three <b>..._command</b> definitions can, in addition, contain the  value  <b>NONE</b>  in  case  a
       particular startup method should be disabled.

       Changing any of these entries will take immediate effect.

       The  global  configuration  entries  for  these  values  may  be  overwritten  by  a execution host local
       configuration.

       See <u><a href="../man5/remote_startup.5.html">remote_startup</a></u>(5) for a detailed explanation of these settings.

   <b>delegated_file_staging</b>
       This flag must be set to "true" when the prolog and epilog are ready for delegated file staging, so  that
       the  DRMAA  attribute  'drmaa_transfer_files'  is supported. To establish delegated file staging, use the
       variables beginning with "$fs_..." in prolog and epilog to move the input, output and  error  files  from
       one  host  to  the  other.   When this flag is set to "false", no file staging is available for the DRMAA
       interface. File staging is currently implemented only via the DRMAA  interface.   When  an  error  occurs
       while  moving  the  input,  output  and  error  files,  return  error code 100 so that the error handling
       mechanism can handle the error correctly. (See also FORBID_APPERROR.)

   <b>reprioritize</b>
       <b>Note:</b> Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
       This flag  enables  or  disables  the  reprioritization  of  jobs  based  on  their  ticket  amount.  The
       <b>reprioritize_interval</b>  in <u><a href="../man5/sched_conf.5.html">sched_conf</a></u>(5) takes effect only if <b>reprioritize</b> is set to true. To turn off job
       reprioritization, the <b>reprioritize</b> flag must be set to false and the <b>reprioritize_interval</b> to 0, which is
       the default.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be overridden by the execution host  local
       configuration.

   <b>jsv_url</b>
       This  setting  defines  a  server  JSV instance which will be started and triggered by the <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8)
       process. This JSV instance will be used to verify job specifications of jobs before they are accepted and
       stored in the internal master database.   The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  cannot  be
       overwritten by execution host local configurations.

       Find more details concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/sge_request.1.html">sge_request</a></u>(1).

       The syntax of the <b>jsv_url</b> is specified in <u><a href="../man1/sge_types.1.html">sge_types</a></u>(1).

   <b>jsv_allowed_mod</b>
       If  there  is  a  server  JSV  script  defined  with the <b>jsv_url</b> parameter, then all <u><a href="../man1/qalter.1.html">qalter</a></u>(1) or <u><a href="../man1/qmon.1.html">qmon</a></u>(1)
       modification  requests  for  jobs  are  rejected  by  qmaster.  With  the  <b>jsv_allowed_mod</b>  parameter  an
       administrator  has  the  possibility  to  allow  a set of switches which can then be used with clients to
       modify certain job attributes. The value for this parameter has to be a comma-separated list of  JSV  job
       parameter  names  as  documented in <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1), or the value <b>none</b> to indicate that no modification should be
       allowed.  Please note that even if <b>none</b> is specified, the switches <b>-w</b> and <b>-t</b> are allowed for qalter.

   <b>libjvm_path</b>
       <b>libjvm_path</b> is usually set during qmaster installation and points to the absolute path of  libjvm.so  (or
       the corresponding library depending on your architecture - e.g. /usr/java/jre/lib/i386/server/libjvm.so).
       The  referenced libjvm version must be at least 1.5.  It is needed by the JVM qmaster thread only. If the
       Java VM needs additional starting parameters they can be set  in  <b>additional_jvm_args</b>.  Whether  the  JVM
       thread  is  started  at  all  can  be  defined  in  the <u><a href="../man5/bootstrap.5.html">bootstrap</a></u>(5) file. If libjvm_path is empty, or an
       incorrect path, the JVM thread fails to start.

       The global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be  overwritten  by  the  execution  host  local
       configuration.

   <b>additional_jvm_args</b>
       <b>additional_jvm_args</b>   is  usually  set  during  qmaster  installation.   Details  about  possible  values
       <b>additional_jvm_args</b> can be found in the help output of the accompanying Java  command.  This  setting  is
       normally not needed.

       The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be  overwritten  by  the  execution  host local
       configuration.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       If <b>prolog</b> or <b>epilog</b> is specified with a <u>user</u><b>@</b> prefix, security considerations apply.  The methods are run
       in a user-supplied environment (via <b>-V</b> or <b>-v</b>) which provides a mechanism to run arbitrary  code  as  <u>user</u>
       (which  might  well  be  root)  by setting variables such as <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> and <b>LD_PRELOAD</b> to affect the
       running of the dynamically linked programs, such as shells, which are used to implement the methods.

       To combat this, known problematic variables are removed from the environment before starting the  methods
       other  than  as the job owner, but this may not be foolproof on arbitrary systems with obscure variables.
       The environment can be safely controlled by running the methods  under  a  statically-linked  version  of
       <u><a href="../man1/env.1.html">env</a></u>(1), such as typically available using <u><a href="../man1/busybox.1.html">busybox</a></u>(1), for example.  Use

              <b><a href="file:/bin/busybox">/bin/busybox</a></b> <b>env</b> <b>-u</b> ...

       to unset sensitive variables, or

              <b><a href="file:/bin/busybox">/bin/busybox</a></b> <b>env</b> <b>-i</b> <b>name=value</b>...

       to set only specific variables.  On some systems, such as recent Solaris, it is essentially impossible to
       build  static  binaries.   In  that case it is typically possible to use a setuid wrapper, relying on the
       dynamic linker to do the right thing.  An example is the <u>safe_exec</u> wrapper which is available from
       ⟨<a href="http://arc.liv.ac.uk/downloads/SGE/support/">http://arc.liv.ac.uk/downloads/SGE/support/</a>⟩ at the time of writing.  When using a  non-shell  scripting
       language wrapper for the method daemon, try to use options which avoid interpreter-specific environmental
       damage,  such  as  Perl's  <b>-T</b>  and  Python's  <b>-E</b>.   Privileged shell script wrappers should be avoided if
       possible, and should be written carefully if they are used - e.g. invoke programs with full file names  -
       but if <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a></u>(1) is used, it should be run with the <b>-p</b> option.

       It  is  not  currently possible to specify the variables unset, e.g. as a host-dependent execd parameter,
       but certain system-dependent ones are selected.  The list of sensitive variables is taken mostly from GNU
       libc and <u><a href="../man1/sudo.1.html">sudo</a></u>(1).  It includes known system-dependent dynamic linker  ones,  sensitive  locale  ones  and
       others, like TMPDIR, but does not attempt to deal interpreter-specific variables such as PYTHONPATH.  The
