       butc_logs - Message logs from the Tape Coordinator process

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Backup System Tape Coordinator (<b>butc</b>) process generates two log files per device, one for error
       messages and one for actions.

   <b>Error</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Log</b>
       The <u>TE_device_name</u> file logs error messages generated by the Backup System Tape Coordinator that controls
       the tape device or backup data file indicated by <u>device_name</u>.

       As the Tape Coordinator initializes, it creates the file in ASCII format in the <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup</u>
       directory. If there is an existing file, the Tape Coordinator renames it to <u>TE_device_name.old</u>&gt;,
       overwriting the existing <u>TE_device_name.old</u>&gt; file if it exists.

       For a tape device, the Tape Coordinator derives the variable <u>device_name</u> portion of the filename from the
       device pathname listed in the local <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup/tapeconfig</u> file, by stripping off the initial
       "<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>" string and replacing any other slashes in the name with underscores. For example, the filename
       for a device called <u>/dev/rmt/4m</u> is <u>TE_rmt_4m</u>. Similarly, for a backup data file the Tape Coordinator
       strips off the initial slash ("/") and replaces any other slashes in the name with underscores. For
       example, the filename for a backup data file called <u>/var/tmp/FILE</u> is <u>TE_var_tmp_FILE</u>.

       The messages in the file describe the error and warning conditions the Tape Coordinator encounters as it
       operates. For instance, a message can list the volumes that are inaccessible during a dump operation, or
       warn that the Tape Coordinator is overwriting a tape or backup data file. The messages also appear in the
       <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup/TL_device_name</u> file, which traces most of the Tape Coordinator's actions.

   <b>Action</b> <b>Log</b>
       The <u>TL_device_name</u> file logs the actions performed by the Backup System Tape Coordinator that controls
       the tape device or backup data file indicated by <u>device_name</u>. It also records the same error and warning
       messages written to the <u>TE_device_name</u> file.

       As the Tape Coordinator initializes, it creates the file in ASCII format in the <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup</u>
       directory. If there is an existing file, the Tape Coordinator renames it to <u>TL_device_name.old</u>,
       overwriting the existing <u>TL_device_name.old</u> file if it exists.

       For a tape device, the Tape Coordinator derives the variable <u>device_name</u> portion of the filename from the
       device pathname listed in the local <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup/tapeconfig</u> file, by stripping off the initial
       "<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>" string and replacing any other slashes in the name with underscores. For example, the filename
       for a device called <u>/dev/rmt/4m</u> is <u>TL_rmt_4m</u>. Similarly, for a backup data file the Tape Coordinator
       strips off the initial slash ("/") and replaces any other slashes in the name with underscores. For
       example, the filename for a backup data file called <u>/var/tmp/FILE</u> is <u>TL_var_tmp_FILE</u>.
