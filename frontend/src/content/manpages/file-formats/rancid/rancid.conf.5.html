</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rancid.conf - rancid environment configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rancid.conf</b> contains environment configuration information for <b><a href="../man1/rancid-run.1.html">rancid-run</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/rancid-cvs.1.html">rancid-cvs</a></b>(1), including
       shell PATH, list of rancid groups, etc.  It is read by several scripts at run-time and others inherit the
       configuration from a parent process which has read it.

       The  syntax  of  <b>rancid.conf</b>  is that of <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1).  <b>rancid.conf</b> is used to set environment variables used by
       other rancid scripts to effect their run-time behavior or to enable them to find their resources.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following variables are used (listed alphabetically):

       <b>ACLFILTERREGEX</b>
              If non-empty, this is a semi-colon-separated (';') list of regexes.  The contents  of  ACLs  whose
              name  match a regex in this list will be filtered.  The purpose of this feature is to filter auto-
              generated lists, thereby reducing the churn within rancid.

              This option implies ACLFILTERSEQ=YES.

              Not all device types nor ACL types are supported by this feature.

              Default: undefined

       <b>ACLFILTERSEQ</b>
              Disables filtering of prefix-list/access-list sequence numbers.  This  option  implies  ACLSORT=NO
              for lists with sequence numbers.

              Default: YES

       <b>ACLSORT</b>
              Permits disabling of access-list sorting, which could alter statement order that had been cleverly
              crafted  by  the  administrator  for optimal performance, thus making recovery and comparison more
              difficult.

              Default: YES

       <b>BASEDIR</b>
              BASEDIR is  the  directory  where  <b>rancid-run's</b>  log  directory,  the  revision  control  system's
              repository, and rancid group directories will be placed.

              Its value is configure's localstatedir and should be modified if rancid is moved to a new location
              in the file system without re-installing from the distribution.

              Default: /var/lib/rancid

       <b>CVSROOT</b>
              <u><a href="../man1/cvs.1.html">cvs</a></u>(1)  and  <u><a href="../man1/rancid-cvs.1.html">rancid-cvs</a></u>(1)  use  this  environment variable to locate the CVS repository.  In some
              cases, particularly for Subversion and git, it is used as an argument to commands.  In general, it
              should not be necessary to alter it, but it could be set to a  remote  location  if  the  the  RCS
              system  supports  it.   If  it  is a remote location, any necessary authentication must be handled
              separately from RANCiD, which provides no means of interacting with the remote.

              Default: $BASEDIR/CVS

       <b>DIFFSCRIPT</b>
              Defines an alternate filter for the output of the RCS diff.  The filter should read from stdin and
              write to stdout.  The default is defined in control_rancid and only improves readability.

              Example: DIFFSCRIPT="sed -e '/^=/d' | expand"; export DIFFSCRIPT

       <b>FILTER_OSC</b>
              Determines if oscillating data such as keys, passwords, etc are filtered from configs.  The  value
              may  be  "NO",  "YES"  or  "ALL".   YES is less aggressive than ALL.  The <b>FILTER_PWDS</b> variable may
              override this.

              Default: YES

              Note: a value of "NO" will most likely produce large repositories and  frequent  diff  e-mail.   A
              value of "YES" is encouraged.

              Note:  <b>FILTER_OSC</b> does not currently affect the handling of SNMP community strings.  see <b>NOCOMMSTR</b>
              below.

       <b>FILTER_PWDS</b>
              Determines which passwords will be filtered from configs.  The value may be "NO", "YES", or  "ALL"
              to  filter  none of the passwords, only those which are reversable or plain-text, or all (plus ssh
              keys, etc), respectively.

              Default: YES

              Note: a value of "NO" could be a security issue since diffs are sent via e-mail.  A value of "ALL"
              is encouraged.

              Note: <b>FILTER_PWDS</b> does not affect the handling of SNMP community strings.  see <b>NOCOMMSTR</b> below.

              Note: passwords whose value cycles (oscillates) and would produce erroneous diffs may be  filtered
              (e.g.: Alteon passwords).  See the <b>FILTER_OSC</b> variable.

       <b>LC_COLLATE</b>
              See <a href="../man1/locale.1.html">locale</a>(1).

       <b>LIST_OF_GROUPS</b>
              Defines  a  list  of  group  names  of  routers  separated by white-space.  These names become the
              directory names in $BASEDIR which contain the data for that set of  devices.   <b><a href="../man1/rancid-run.1.html">rancid-run</a></b>(1)  also
              uses  this  variable to determine which device groups it should collect.  Choose these names to be
              descriptive of the set of devices and do not use spaces, unprintable characters, etc.

              Example: LIST_OF_GROUPS="UofO USFS"

              Two groups are defined; UofO (University of Oregon) and USFS (US Forest Service).  Each will  have
              a  directory  created (see <u><a href="../man1/rancid-cvs.1.html">rancid-cvs</a></u>(1)) $BASEDIR/UofO and $BASEDIR/USFS respectively, which will
              contain their data.

              Each group  must  also  have  aliases  for  the  administrative  and  diff  recipients  set-up  in
              <u>/etc/aliases</u>.  For example:

                        rancid-uofo:            frank
                        rancid-admin-uofo:      joe,bob
                        rancid-usfs:            frank
                        rancid-admin-usfs:      joe,bob

       <b>LOCKTIME</b>
              Defines  the  number of hours a group's lock file may age before rancid starts to complain about a
              hung collection.  The default is 4 hours.

       <b>LOGDIR</b> Directory where <b>rancid-run</b> places log files.  This can not be set  or  altered  effectively  in  a
              group-specific <b>rancid.conf.</b>

              Default: $BASEDIR/logs

       <b>MAILDOMAIN</b>
              Define  the  domain  part  of  addresses  for  administrative  and diff e-mail.  The value of this
              variable is simply appended to the normal mail addresses.  For example <a href="mailto:rancid-usfs@example.com">rancid-usfs@example.com</a>, if
              <b>MAILDOMAIN</b> had been set to "@example.com".

       <b>MAILHEADERS</b>
              Define additional mail headers to be added to rancid mail, such as Precedence or X- style headers.
              Individual headers must be separated by a \n (new line).

              Default: Precedence: bulk

              Example: Precedence: bulk\nX-clamation: beef cake

       <b>MAILOPTS</b>
              Define additional options used to invoke <b><a href="../man8/sendmail.8.html">sendmail</a></b>(8).  By default, this is not set.

              Example: MAILOPTS="-f <a href="mailto:bounces.go.here@example.com">bounces.go.here@example.com</a>"

       <b>MAILSPLIT</b>
              Defines the maximum BODY size of diffs in kilobytes, such that diffs  are  split  into  clunks  no
              larger than N kbytes.  The minimum is 0, which disables splitting.

              Default: 0.

       <b>MAX_ROUNDS</b>
              Defines how many times rancid should retry collection of devices that fail.  The minimum is 0.

              Default: 4.

       <b>NOCOMMSTR</b>
              If  set,  <u><a href="../man1/rancid.1.html">rancid</a></u>(1)  will  filter  SNMP  community  strings from configs.  Otherwise, they will be
              retained and may appear in clear-text in e-mail diffs.  By default, this is not set.

       <b>OLDTIME</b>
              Specified as a number of hours, OLDTIME defines how many hours  should  pass  since  a  successful
              collection  of  a device's configuration and when <u><a href="../man1/control_rancid.1.html">control_rancid</a></u>(1) should start complaining about
              failures.  The value should be greater than the number of hours between <b>rancid-run</b> cron runs.

              Default: 24

       <b>PAR_COUNT</b>
              Defines  the  number  of  rancid  processes  that  <u><a href="../man1/rancid_par.1.html">rancid_par</a></u>(1)  will  start  simultaneously   as
              <u><a href="../man1/control_rancid.1.html">control_rancid</a></u>(1) attempts to perform collections.  Raising this value will decrease the amount of
              time  necessary  for  a  complete  collection of a (or all) rancid groups at the expense of system
              load.  The default is relatively cautious.  If collections are not completing quickly  enough  for
              users, use trial and error of speed versus system load to find a suitable value.

              Default: 5

       <b>PATH</b>   Is  a  colon  separate list of directory pathnames in the the file system where rancid's <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1) and
              <u><a href="../man1/perl.1.html">perl</a></u>(1) scripts should look for the programs that it needs, such as <u><a href="../man1/telnet.1.html">telnet</a></u>(1).  Its value  is  set
              by   configure.    Should   it   be   necessary   to  modify  PATH,  note  that  it  must  include
              /usr/lib/rancid/bin.

       <b>RCSSYS</b> Sets which revision control system is in use.  Valid values are <b>cvs</b> for CVS, <b>git</b> for  Git  or  <b>svn</b>
              for Subversion.

              Default: cvs

       <b>SENDMAIL</b>
              The  filename  or FQPN of the sendmail executable (or script) that will accept the -t option, such
              that it will read recipients and other headers from stdin.

       <b>TERM</b>   Some Unix utilities require TERM, the terminal type, to be set to a  sane  value.   Some  clients,
              such  as <u><a href="../man1/telnet.1.html">telnet</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)<u>,</u> communicate this to the server (i.e.: the remote device), thus this
              can affect the behavior of login sessions on a device.  The default should suffice.

              Default: network

       <b>TMPDIR</b> Some Unix utilities recognize TMPDIR as a directory where temporary files can be stored.  In  some
              cases, rancid utilizes this directory for lock files and other temporary files.

              Default: <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>

       Each  of  these  are simply environment variables.  In order for them to be present in the environment of
       child processes, each must be exported.  See <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1) for more information on the built-in command export.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rancid.conf</b> is interpreted directly by <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1), so its syntax follows that of the bourne shell.  Errors may
       produce quite unexpected results.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/rancid/rancid.conf</b>
              Configuration file described here.

       <b>&lt;group&gt;/rancid.conf</b>
              Group-specific configuration file described here.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man1/control_rancid.1.html">control_rancid</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/rancid.1.html">rancid</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/rancid-cvs.1.html">rancid-cvs</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/rancid-run.1.html">rancid-run</a></b>(1)

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       In RANCID releases prior to 2.3, <b>rancid.conf</b> was named <b>env</b> and located in the bin  directory.   This  was
       changed to be more consistent with common file location practices.

                                                  20 July 2021                                    <u><a href="../man5/rancid.conf.5.html">rancid.conf</a></u>(5)
