</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sopwith.cfg - configuration file for SDL Sopwith

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>sopwith.cfg</u>  is  the  configuration  file for <b><a href="../man6/sopwith.6.html">sopwith</a></b>(6).  The settings stored in <u>sopwith.cfg</u> are usually
       modified in-game via the options menu.

       <u>sopwith.cfg</u> is normally stored in the user's home directory, as  <u><a href="file:~/.local/share/SDL">~/.local/share/SDL</a></u>  <u>Sopwith/default.cfg</u>.
       The  path  can  be  overridden  using  the <b>XDG_DATA_HOME</b> environment variable (see the XDG Base Directory
       Specification).

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The file is a plain-text file, consisting of a list of configuration options and their values,  separated
       by whitespace.  Each option is stored on a separate line.

       For example:

              integer_value                1
              integer_value2               1

       Lines  beginning  with "#" are interpreted as comments and will be ignored.  Invalid lines or comments in
       the file will generate a warning, but will otherwise be ignored.

       Some options are used for keyboard key bindings; these  are  stored  as  integer  values  containing  the
       keyboard  scan  code of the key to be bound to.  Boolean values are also stored as integers, with a value
       of zero usually indicating "false" and a non-zero value indicating "true".

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vid_fullscreen</b>
              If 1, the game runs full screen rather than in a window. By default this is 0.

       <b>conf_solidground</b>
              If 1, display the ground as a solid white block, reproducing the visual appearance of "Sopwith 1".
              If 0, the ground is displayed as a line, reproducing the visual  appearance  of  "Sopwith  2".  By
              default this is 0.

       <b>conf_video_palette</b>
              Video  palette  to  use  for  display.  Valid  values are 0 (CGA 1), 1 (CGA 2), 2 (CGA 3), 3 (Mono
              Amber), 4 (Mono Green), 5 (Mono Grey), 6 (Tosh LCD 1), 7 (Tosh LCD 2), 8  (Tosh  LCD  3),  9  (IBM
              LCD), 10 (Tandy LCD), 11 (Gas Plasma) or 12 (Atari).

       <b>conf_hudsplats</b>
              If  1,  "splats"  are shown on the screen when the plane takes damage: splatted birds are shown on
              the screen after a bird strike; windscreen "cracks" are shown if the plane is hit by bullets,  and
              the whole screen turns magenta after flying through an ox.  This feature was added by the original
              author of Sopwith in the "Network Edition" release.  By default this is 0.

       <b>conf_wounded</b>
              If  1, planes can take a single unit of damage without crashing. Your plane becomes slower to turn
              when wounded.  This feature was added by the original author of Sopwith in the  "Network  Edition"
              release.  By default this is 0.

       <b>conf_animals</b>
              If  1,  oxen and birds appear in the game. These were added in "Sopwith 2" but were not present in
              the original "Sopwith 1".  By default this is 1.

       <b>conf_harrykeys</b>
              If 1, the <b>key_pullup</b> and <b>key_pulldown</b> controls turn your plane relative to the screen, rather than
              your plane. It is a common point of confusion that the direction of turning appears  to  "reverse"
              when the plane is flipped / flying towards the left.  By default this is 0.

       <b>conf_big_explosions</b>
              If  1,  oil  tanks  produce a huge explosion when destroyed. This reproduces the behavior found in
              both "Sopwith 1" and "Sopwith 2", but the magnitude of the explosion was dialed back significantly
              in the "Network Edition" release.  The default is 1.

       <b>conf_medals</b>
              If 1, medals are sometimes awarded to the player on return to base. Some details can be  found  in
              the  "MEDALS"  section  of  <b><a href="../man6/sopwith.6.html">sopwith</a></b>(6). The medals do not have any effect on gameplay.  By default
              this is 1.

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The following settings determine the in-game controls. These are keyboard scancodes, so the  key  binding
       does  not change with keyboard layout. However, the name for the key as shown in the in-game options menu
       should match the current keyboard layout.  The values for  these  settings  are  scancodes  from  the USB
       standard for HID devices.

       <b>key_accelerate</b>
              Key to accelerate the plane. Default is "X" on a US layout keyboard.

       <b>key_decelerate</b>
              Key to decelerate the plane. Decelerating too much may cause the plane to stall. Default is "Z" on
              a US layout keyboard.

       <b>key_pullup</b>
              Key  to pull up (aim the plane towards the sky). Default is "," on a US layout keyboard. Note that
              <b>conf_harrykeys</b> may change the behavior of this key binding.

       <b>key_pulldown</b>
              Key to pull down (aim the plane towards the ground. Default is "/" on a US layout keyboard.   Note
              that <b>conf_harrykeys</b> may change the behavior of this key binding.

       <b>key_flip</b>
              Key to flip the plane upside down. Default is "." on a US layout keyboard.

       <b>key_fire</b>
              Key to fire the machine gun. Default on a US layout keyboard is the spacebar.

       <b>key_dropbomb</b>
              Key to drop a bomb. Default is "B" on a US layout keyboard.

       <b>key_home</b>
              Key to autopilot the plane home to base. Default is "H" on a US layout keyboard.

</pre><h4><b>HIDDEN</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following are "hidden settings": they cannot be edited in-game via the options menu, and editing the
       configuration file is the only way to change them.

       <b>snd_tinnyfilter</b>
              If 1, a filter is applied to the sound output so that it sounds  more  like  a  tinny  PC  speaker
              that's inside a metal PC case. By default this is 1.

       <b>conf_missiles</b>
              Enable missiles and starbursts (flares). This is a feature that was originally added by the author
              of  Sopwith  in the "Network Edition" release, but has been hidden as it significantly changes the
              gameplay in a way that doesn't fit the game's theme and also isn't particularly fun.

       <b>key_missile</b>
              Fire missile, if <b>conf_missiles</b> is enabled. Default key is "V" on a US layout keyboard.

       <b>key_starburst</b>
              Launch starburst (flare) if <b>conf_missiles</b> is enabled. Default key is "C" on a US layout keyboard.
