       /proc/pid/stat - status information

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/stat</u>
              Status  information about the process.  This is used by <b><a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a></b>(1).  It is defined in the kernel source
              file <u>fs/proc/array.c</u>.

              The fields, in order, with their proper <b><a href="../man3/scanf.3.html">scanf</a></b>(3) format specifiers, are listed below.  Whether  or
              not  certain  of  these  fields  display  valid  information  is  governed by a ptrace access mode
              <b>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS</b> | <b>PTRACE_MODE_NOAUDIT</b> check (refer to <b><a href="../man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace</a></b>(2)).  If  the  check  denies
              access,  then  the  field  value  is  displayed  as 0.  The affected fields are indicated with the
              marking [PT].

              (1) <u>pid</u>  %d
                     The process ID.

              (2) <u>comm</u>  %s
                     The filename of the executable, in parentheses.  Strings  longer  than  <b>TASK_COMM_LEN</b>  (16)
                     characters  (including  the terminating null byte) are silently truncated.  This is visible
                     whether or not the executable is swapped out.

              (3) <u>state</u>  %c
                     One of the following characters, indicating process state:

                     R      Running

                     S      Sleeping in an interruptible wait

                     D      Waiting in uninterruptible disk sleep

                     Z      Zombie

                     T      Stopped (on a signal) or (before Linux 2.6.33) trace stopped

                     t      Tracing stop (Linux 2.6.33 onward)

                     W      Paging (only before Linux 2.6.0)

                     X      Dead (from Linux 2.6.0 onward)

                     x      Dead (Linux 2.6.33 to 3.13 only)

              (4) <u>ppid</u>  %d
                     The PID of the parent of this process.

              (5) <u>pgrp</u>  %d
                     The process group ID of the process.

              (6) <u>session</u>  %d
                     The session ID of the process.

              (7) <u>tty_nr</u>  %d
                     The controlling terminal of the process.  (The minor device  number  is  contained  in  the
                     combination of bits 31 to 20 and 7 to 0; the major device number is in bits 15 to 8.)

              (8) <u>tpgid</u>  %d
                     The ID of the foreground process group of the controlling terminal of the process.

              (9) <u>flags</u>  %u
                     The  kernel flags word of the process.  For bit meanings, see the PF_* defines in the Linux
                     kernel source file <u>include/linux/sched.h</u>.  Details depend on the kernel version.

                     The format for this field was %lu before Linux 2.6.

              (10) <u>minflt</u>  %lu
                     The number of minor faults the process has made which have not required  loading  a  memory
                     page from disk.

              (11) <u>cminflt</u>  %lu
                     The number of minor faults that the process's waited-for children have made.

              (12) <u>majflt</u>  %lu
                     The  number  of major faults the process has made which have required loading a memory page
                     from disk.

              (13) <u>cmajflt</u>  %lu
                     The number of major faults that the process's waited-for children have made.

              (14) <u>utime</u>  %lu
                     Amount of time that this process has been scheduled in user mode, measured in  clock  ticks
                     (divide by <u>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</u>).  This includes guest time, <u>guest_time</u> (time spent running
                     a  virtual CPU, see below), so that applications that are not aware of the guest time field
                     do not lose that time from their calculations.

              (15) <u>stime</u>  %lu
                     Amount of time that this process has been scheduled in kernel mode, measured in clock ticks
                     (divide by <u>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</u>).

              (16) <u>cutime</u>  %ld
                     Amount of time that this process's waited-for children have been scheduled  in  user  mode,
                     measured  in  clock  ticks  (divide  by  <u>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</u>).  (See also <b><a href="../man2/times.2.html">times</a></b>(2).)  This
                     includes guest time, <u>cguest_time</u> (time spent running a virtual CPU, see below).

              (17) <u>cstime</u>  %ld
                     Amount of time that this process's waited-for children have been scheduled in kernel  mode,
                     measured in clock ticks (divide by <u>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</u>).

              (18) <u>priority</u>  %ld
                     (Explanation  for  Linux  2.6)  For processes running a real-time scheduling policy (<u>policy</u>
                     below; see <b><a href="../man2/sched_setscheduler.2.html">sched_setscheduler</a></b>(2)), this is the negated scheduling priority, minus one; that
                     is, a number in the range -2 to -100, corresponding to real-time priorities 1 to  99.   For
                     processes  running  under  a  non-real-time  scheduling  policy, this is the raw nice value
                     (<b><a href="../man2/setpriority.2.html">setpriority</a></b>(2)) as represented in the kernel.  The kernel stores nice values as numbers in
                     the range 0 (high) to 39 (low), corresponding to the user-visible nice range of -20 to 19.

                     Before Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on the scheduler weighting  given  to  this
                     process.

              (19) <u>nice</u>  %ld
                     The  nice  value  (see <b><a href="../man2/setpriority.2.html">setpriority</a></b>(2)), a value in the range 19 (low priority) to -20 (high
                     priority).

              (20) <u>num_threads</u>  %ld
                     Number of threads in this process (since Linux 2.6).  Before Linux 2.6, this field was hard
                     coded to 0 as a placeholder for an earlier removed field.

              (21) <u>itrealvalue</u>  %ld
                     The time in jiffies before the next <b>SIGALRM</b> is sent to  the  process  due  to  an  interval
                     timer.  Since Linux 2.6.17, this field is no longer maintained, and is hard coded as 0.

              (22) <u>starttime</u>  %llu
                     The time the process started after system boot.  Before Linux 2.6, this value was expressed
                     in  jiffies.   Since  Linux  2.6,  the  value  is  expressed  in  clock  ticks  (divide  by
                     <u>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</u>).

                     The format for this field was %lu before Linux 2.6.

              (23) <u>vsize</u>  %lu
                     Virtual memory size in bytes.

              (24) <u>rss</u>  %ld
                     Resident Set Size: number of pages the process has in real memory.  This is just the  pages
                     which  count toward text, data, or stack space.  This does not include pages which have not
                     been  demand-loaded  in,  or  which  are  swapped  out.   This  value  is  inaccurate;  see
                     <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/statm</u> below.

              (25) <u>rsslim</u>  %lu
                     Current soft limit in bytes on the rss of the process; see the description of <b>RLIMIT_RSS</b> in

                     process.

              (30) <u>kstkeip</u>  %lu  [PT]
                     The current EIP (instruction pointer).

              (31) <u>signal</u>  %lu
                     The bitmap of pending signals, displayed as a decimal number.  Obsolete,  because  it  does
                     not provide information on real-time signals; use <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/status</u> instead.

              (32) <u>blocked</u>  %lu
                     The  bitmap  of  blocked signals, displayed as a decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does

              (33) <u>sigignore</u>  %lu
                     The bitmap of ignored signals, displayed as a decimal number.  Obsolete,  because  it  does

              (34) <u>sigcatch</u>  %lu
                     The bitmap of caught signals, displayed as a decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not
                     provide information on real-time signals; use <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/status</u> instead.

              (35) <u>wchan</u>  %lu  [PT]
                     This  is the "channel" in which the process is waiting.  It is the address of a location in
                     the kernel where the process is sleeping.  The corresponding symbolic name can be found  in
                     <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/wchan</u>.
