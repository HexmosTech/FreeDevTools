</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       srec_mos_tech - MOS Technology file format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  MOS  Technology  format allows binary files to be uploaded and downloaded between between a computer
       system (such as a PC, Macintosh, or workstation) and an emulator or evaluation board for microcontrollers
       and microprocessors.

   <b>The</b> <b>Lines</b>
       Each line consists of 5 fields.  These are the length field, address field, data field, and the checksum.
       The lines always start with a semicolon (;) character.

   <b>The</b> <b>Fields</b>
                                  ┌───┬────────┬─────────┬──────┬──────────┬──────┐
                                  │ ; │ Length │ Address │ Data │ Checksum │ CRLF │
                                  └───┴────────┴─────────┴──────┴──────────┴──────┘

       Length  The record length field is a 2 character (1 byte) field that specifies the number of  data  bytes
               in the record.  Typically this is 24 or less.

       Address This is a 2‐byte address that specifies where the data in the record is to be loaded into memory,
               big‐endian.

       Data    The  data  field contains the executable code, memory‐loadable data or descriptive information to
               be transferred.

       Checksum
               The checksum is an 2‐byte field that represents the least significant two bytes of the the sum of
               the values represented by the pairs of characters making up the  record's  length,  address,  and
               data fields, big‐endian.

   <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>File</b>
       The  final  line  should  have  a data length of zero, and the data line count in the address field.  The
       checksum is not the usual checksum, it is instead a repeat of the data line count.

   <b>Size</b> <b>Multiplier</b>
       In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately  2.54  times  when  represented  with  this
       format.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Here  is  an  example  MOS  Technology  format file.  It contains the data “Hello, World” to be loaded at
       address 0.

       <u>(The</u>  <u>following</u>  <u>information</u> <u>is</u> <u>reproduced</u> <u>from</u> <u><a href="http://users.telenet.be/kim1">http://users.telenet.be/kim1</a>‐6502/6502/usrman.html#F</u> <u>just</u>

       The paper tape LOAD and DUMP routines store and retrieve data in a specific  format  designed  to  insure
       error  free  recovery.   Each  byte  of data to be stored is converted to two half bytes.  The half bytes
       (whose possible values are 0 to F HEX) are translated into their ASCII equivalents and written  out  onto
       paper tape in this form.

       Each  record  outputted  begins with a “;” character (ASCII 3B) to mark the start of a valid record.  The
       next byte transmitted (18HEX) or (24 decimal) is the number of data bytes contained in the  record.   The
       record's  starting  address  High (1 byte, 2 characters), starting address Lo (1 byte, 2 characters), and
       data (24 bytes, 48 characters) follow.  Each record is terminated by the record's check‐sum (2  bytes,  4
       characters),  a  carriage  return (ASCII 0D), line feed (ASCII 0A), and six “NULL” characters (ASCII 00).
       (NULL characters cause a blank area on the paper tape.)

       The last record transmitted has zero data bytes (indicated by ;00) The starting address field is replaced
       by a four digit Hex number representing the total number of data records contained in  the  transmission,
       followed by the records usual check‐sum digits.  An “XOFF” character ends the transmission.

              ;0000010001
       During a “LOAD” all incoming data is ignored until a “;” character is received.  The receipt of non ASCII
       data  or a mismatch between a records calculated check‐sum and the check‐sum read from tape will cause an
       error condition to be recognized by KIM.  The check‐sum is calculated by adding all data  in  the  record
       except the “;” character.

       The  paper  tape  format  described  is  compatible  with all other MOS Technology, Inc. software support
       programs.
