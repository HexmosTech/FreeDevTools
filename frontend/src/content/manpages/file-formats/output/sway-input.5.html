       sway-input - input configuration file and commands

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sway  allows  for  configuration  of  devices  within  the  sway  configuration file. To obtain a list of
       available device identifiers, run <b>swaymsg</b> <b>-t</b> <b>get_inputs</b>. Settings  can  also  be  applied  to  all  input
       devices  by  using  the  wildcard,  <u>*</u>,  in  place of <u>&lt;identifier&gt;</u> in the commands below. In addition, the
       settings can be applied to a type of device, by using <u>type:&lt;input_type&gt;</u> in place of <u>&lt;identifier&gt;</u>.

       In the configuration file, settings with a more specific selector take precedence over more general ones:
       <u>&lt;identifier&gt;</u> &gt; <u>type:&lt;input_type&gt;</u> &gt; <u>*</u>.  When executing input commands, however, the settings  are  applied
       to  all  matching  input  devices!   This  means  that  <u>type:&lt;input_type&gt;</u>  can  override  previously  set
       <u>&lt;identifier&gt;</u> settings, even though in a configuration file they would take precedence.  Similarly  <u>*</u>  can
       override both <u>&lt;identifier&gt;</u> and <u>type:&lt;input_type&gt;</u> settings, if applied later.

       Tip:  If  the  configuration settings do not appear to be taking effect, you could try using <u>*</u> instead of
       <u>&lt;identifier&gt;</u>. If it works with the wildcard, try using a different identifier from <b>swaymsg</b> <b>-t</b>  <b>get_inputs</b>
       until you find the correct input device.

       Current available input types are:

       •   touchpad
       •   pointer
       •   keyboard
       •   touch
       •   tablet_tool
       •   tablet_pad
       •   switch

       Note:  The  type  configurations are applied as the devices appear and get applied on top of the existing
       device configurations.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; repeat_delay &lt;milliseconds&gt;
           Sets the amount of time a key must be held before it starts repeating.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; repeat_rate &lt;characters per second&gt;
           Sets the frequency of key repeats once the repeat_delay has passed.

       For more information on these xkb configuration options, see <b><a href="../man7/xkeyboard-config.7.html">xkeyboard-config</a></b>(7).

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; xkb_file &lt;file_name&gt;
           Sets all xkb configurations from a complete .xkb file. This file can be dumped from <u>xkbcomp</u>  <u>$DISPLAY</u>
           <u>keymap.xkb</u>.  This  setting  overrides  xkb_layout, xkb_model, xkb_options, xkb_rules, and xkb_variant
           settings.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; xkb_layout &lt;layout_name&gt;
           Sets the layout of the keyboard like <u>us</u> or <u>de</u>.

           Multiple layouts can be specified by separating them with commas.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; xkb_model &lt;model_name&gt;
           Sets the model of the keyboard. This has an influence for some extra keys your keyboard might have.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; xkb_options &lt;options&gt;
           Sets extra xkb configuration options for the keyboard.

           Multiple options can be specified by separating them with commas.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; xkb_rules &lt;rules&gt;
           Sets files of rules to be used for keyboard mapping composition.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; xkb_switch_layout &lt;index&gt;|next|prev
           Changes the active keyboard layout to &lt;index&gt; counting from zero or to next or previous layout on the
           list. If there is no next or previous layout, this command hops to the other end of the list.

           This can be used when multiple layouts are configured with <b>xkb_layout</b>. A  list  of  layouts  you  can
           switch between can be obtained with <b>swaymsg</b> <b>-t</b> <b>get_inputs</b>.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; xkb_variant &lt;variant&gt;
           Sets the variant of the keyboard like <u>dvorak</u> or <u>colemak</u>.

       The following commands may only be used in the configuration file.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; xkb_capslock enabled|disabled
           Initially enables or disables CapsLock on startup, the default is disabled.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; xkb_numlock enabled|disabled
           Initially enables or disables NumLock on startup, the default is disabled.

   <b>TABLET</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; tool_mode &lt;tool&gt; &lt;absolute|relative&gt;
           Sets  whether  movement  of  a  tablet tool should be treated as absolute or relative; the default is
           absolute.

           Valid values for <u>&lt;tool&gt;</u> are  currently  "pen",  "eraser",  "brush",  "pencil",  "airbrush",  and  the
           wildcard <u>*</u>, which matches all tools.

           Mouse and lens tools ignore this setting and are always treated as relative.

   <b>MAPPING</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; map_to_output &lt;identifier&gt;
           Maps  inputs  from  this  device to the specified output. Only meaningful if the device is a pointer,
           touch, or drawing tablet device.

           The wildcard <u>*</u> can be used to map the input device to the whole desktop layout.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; map_to_region &lt;X&gt; &lt;Y&gt; &lt;width&gt; &lt;height&gt;
           Maps inputs from this device to the specified region of the global output layout. Only meaningful  if
           the device is a pointer, touch, or drawing tablet device.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; map_from_region &lt;X1xY1&gt; &lt;X2xY2&gt;
           Ignores  inputs from this device that do not occur within the specified region. Can be in millimeters
           (e.g. 10x20mm 20x40mm) or the fraction of the full available space in terms  of  0..1  (e.g.  0.5x0.5
           0.7x0.7).  Not  all  devices support millimeters. Only meaningful if the device is not a keyboard and
           provides events in absolute terms (such as a drawing tablet or touch screen - most  pointers  provide
           events relative to the previous frame).

           Commonly  used  to  maintain  the aspect ratio of the input device and screen. Cropping a 16:10 input
           region to match a 16:9 display can use 0x0 1x0.9 as the argument.

   <b>LIBINPUT</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; accel_profile adaptive|flat
           Sets the pointer acceleration profile for the specified input device.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; calibration_matrix &lt;6 space-separated floating point values&gt;
           Sets the calibration matrix.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; click_method none|button_areas|clickfinger
           Changes the click method for the specified device.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; clickfinger_button_map lrm|lmr
           Specifies which button mapping to use for clickfinger. <u>lrm</u> treats 1 finger as left click,  2  fingers
           as right click, and 3 fingers as middle click. <u>lmr</u> treats 1 finger as left click, 2 fingers as middle
           click, and 3 fingers as right click.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; drag enabled|disabled
           Enables or disables tap-and-drag for specified input device.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; drag_lock enabled|disabled
           Enables or disables drag lock for specified input device.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; dwt enabled|disabled
           Enables or disables disable-while-typing for the specified input device.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; dwtp enabled|disabled
           Enables or disables disable-while-trackpointing for the specified input device.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; events enabled|disabled|disabled_on_external_mouse|toggle [&lt;toggle-modes&gt;]
           Enables  or disables send_events for specified input device. Disabling send_events disables the input
           device.

           The <u>toggle</u> option cannot be used in the config. If no toggle modes are listed,  all  supported  modes
           for  the  device  will  be  toggled  through  in  the order: enabled,     disabled_on_external_mouse,
           disabled, (loop back). If toggle modes are listed, they will be cycled  through,  defaulting  to  the
           first  mode  listed  if  the current mode is not in the list. They will also not be checked to see if
           they are supported for the device and may fail.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; left_handed enabled|disabled
           Enables or disables left handed mode for specified input device.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; middle_emulation enabled|disabled
           Enables or disables middle click emulation.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; natural_scroll enabled|disabled
           Enables or disables natural (inverted) scrolling for the specified input device.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; pointer_accel [&lt;-1|1&gt;]
           Changes the pointer acceleration for the specified input device.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; rotation_angle &lt;angle&gt;
           Sets the rotation angle of the device to the given clockwise angle in  degrees.  The  angle  must  be
           between 0.0 (inclusive) and 360.0 (exclusive).

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; scroll_button disable|button[1-3,8,9]|&lt;event-code-or-name&gt;
           Sets  the  button  used for scroll_method on_button_down. The button can be given as an event name or
           code, which can be obtained from <b>libinput</b> <b>debug-events</b>, or as a x11 mouse  button  (button[1-3,8,9]).
           If set to <u>disable</u>, it disables the scroll_method on_button_down.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; scroll_button_lock enabled|disabled
           Enables or disables scroll button lock for specified input device.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; scroll_factor &lt;floating point value&gt;
           Changes  the  scroll  factor for the specified input device. Scroll speed will be scaled by the given
           value, which must be non-negative.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; scroll_method none|two_finger|edge|on_button_down
           Changes the scroll method for the specified input device.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; tap enabled|disabled
           Enables or disables tap for specified input device.

       <b>input</b> &lt;identifier&gt; tap_button_map lrm|lmr
           Specifies which button mapping to use for tapping. <u>lrm</u> treats 1 finger as left click,  2  fingers  as
           right  click,  and  3 fingers as middle click. <u>lmr</u> treats 1 finger as left click, 2 fingers as middle
           click, and 3 fingers as right click.

   <b>SEAT</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       Configure options for multiseat mode.

       A <b>seat</b> is a collection of input devices that act independently of each other.  Seats  are  identified  by
       name  and  the default seat is <u>seat0</u> if no seats are configured. While sway is running, <u>-</u> (hyphen) can be
       used as an alias for the current seat. Each seat has an independent keyboard focus and a separate  cursor
       that  is  controlled  by  the  pointer  devices of the seat. This is useful for multiple people using the
       desktop at the same time with their own  devices  (each  sitting  in  their  own  "seat").  The  wildcard
       character, <u>*</u>, can also be used in place of <u>&lt;identifier&gt;</u> to change settings for all seats.

       Tip:  If  the  configuration settings do not appear to be taking effect, you could try using <u>*</u> instead of
       <u>&lt;identifier&gt;</u>. If it works with the wildcard, try using a different identifier from <b>swaymsg</b>  <b>-t</b>  <b>get_seats</b>
       until you find the correct seat.

       <b>seat</b> &lt;name&gt; attach &lt;input_identifier&gt;
           Attach  an  input device to this seat by its input identifier. A special value of "*" will attach all
           devices to the seat.

       <b>seat</b> &lt;seat&gt; cursor move|set &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt;
           Move specified seat's cursor relative to current position  or  wrap  to  absolute  coordinates  (with
           respect  to  the  global  coordinate  space).  Specifying  either  value  as  0  will not update that
           coordinate.

           Deprecated: use the virtual-pointer Wayland protocol instead.

       <b>seat</b> &lt;seat&gt; cursor press|release button[1-9]|&lt;event-name-or-code&gt;
           Simulate pressing (or releasing) the specified mouse button on the specified  seat.  The  button  can
           either  be  provided as a button event name or event code, which can be obtained from <b>libinput</b> <b>debug-</b>
           <b>events</b>, or as an x11 mouse button (button[1-9]). If using button[4-7], which map  to  axes,  an  axis
           event will be simulated, however <u>press</u> and <u>release</u> will be ignored and both will occur.

           Deprecated: use the virtual-pointer Wayland protocol instead.

       <b>seat</b> &lt;name&gt; fallback true|false
           Set this seat as the fallback seat. A fallback seat will attach any device not explicitly attached to
           another seat (similar to a "default" seat).

       <b>seat</b> &lt;name&gt; hide_cursor &lt;timeout&gt;|when-typing [enable|disable]
           Hides the cursor image after the specified event occurred.

           If  <u>timeout</u>  is specified, then the cursor will be hidden after <u>timeout</u> (in milliseconds) has elapsed
           with no activity on the cursor. A timeout of 0 (default) disables  hiding  the  cursor.  The  minimal
           timeout is 100 and any value less than that (aside from 0), will be increased to 100.

           If <u>when-typing</u> is enabled, then the cursor will be hidden whenever a key is pressed.

           Be  aware  that this setting can interfere with input handling in games and certain types of software
           (Gimp, Blender etc) that rely on simultaneous input from mouse and keyboard.

       <b>seat</b> &lt;name&gt; idle_inhibit &lt;sources...&gt;
           Sets the set of input event sources which can prevent  the  seat  from  becoming  idle,  as  a  space
           separated  list  of  source  names.  Valid  names  are  "keyboard",  "pointer",  "touchpad", "touch",
           "tablet_pad", "tablet_tool", and "switch". The default behavior is to prevent idle on any event.

       <b>seat</b> &lt;name&gt; keyboard_grouping none|smart
           Set how the keyboards in the seat are grouped together. Currently, there are two options.  <u>none</u>  will
           disable  all keyboard grouping. This will make it so each keyboard device has its own isolated state.
           <u>smart</u> will group the keyboards in the seat by their keymap and repeat info. This is useful  for  when
           the keyboard appears as multiple separate input devices. In this mode, the effective layout is synced
           between  the  keyboards in the group. The default is <u>smart</u>. To restore the behavior of older versions
           of sway, use <u>none</u>.

       <b>seat</b> &lt;name&gt; pointer_constraint enable|disable|escape
           Enables or disables the ability for clients to capture the cursor (enabled by default) for the  seat.
           This  is primarily useful for video games. The "escape" command can be used at runtime to escape from
           a captured client.

       <b>seat</b> &lt;name&gt; shortcuts_inhibitor enable|disable|activate|deactivate|toggle
           Enables or disables the ability of clients to inhibit  keyboard  shortcuts  for  the  seat.  This  is
           primarily  useful  for  virtualization  and  remote  desktop software. Subcommands <u>enable</u> and <u>disable</u>
           affect whether future inhibitors are honoured by default, i.e. activated automatically,  the  default
           being  <u>enable</u>. When used at runtime, <u>disable</u> also disables any currently active inhibitors. <u>activate</u>,
           <u>deactivate</u> and <u>toggle</u> are only usable at runtime and change  the  state  of  a  potentially  existing
           inhibitor on the currently focused window. This can be used with the current seat alias (<u>-</u>) to affect
           only  the  currently focused window of the current seat. Subcommand <u>deactivate</u> is particularly useful
           in an <u>--inhibited</u> <b>bindsym</b> to escape a state where shortcuts are  inhibited  and  the  client  becomes
           uncooperative.  It  is  worth  noting  that whether disabled or deactivated inhibitors are removed is
           entirely up to the client. Depending on the client it may therefore be possible to (re-)activate them
           later. Any visual indication that an inhibitor is present is currently left to the client as well.

       <b>seat</b> &lt;name&gt; xcursor_theme &lt;theme&gt; [&lt;size&gt;]
           Override the system default XCursor theme. The default seat's (<u>seat0</u>)  theme  is  also  used  as  the
           default cursor theme in XWayland, and exported through the <u>XCURSOR_THEME</u> and <u>XCURSOR_SIZE</u> environment
           variables.
