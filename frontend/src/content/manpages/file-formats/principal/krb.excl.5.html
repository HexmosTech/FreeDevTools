       krb.excl - Lists exclusions for mapping kerberos principals to AFS identities

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/openafs/server/krb.excl</u> is an optional file that resides on an OpenAFS server and is used to list
       exceptions to the algorithm of mapping kerberos principals to AFS identities. It contains the name of one
       or more principals; each principal should be on a line by itself. If a principal appears in this file,
       that principal will never be recognized by an OpenAFS server as a local identity, even if the realm is
       specified as a local realm in <b><a href="../man5/krb.conf.5.html">krb.conf</a></b>(5).

       The principal names specified in this file must include the realm, and should be in Kerberos 4 format.
       That is, specify "user.inst@REALM", not "user/inst@REALM", "user.inst", nor "user/inst".

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       It is possible to use the <b><a href="../man5/krb.conf.5.html">krb.conf</a></b>(5) configuration file to specify that multiple Kerberos realms can be
       considered `local' realms by OpenAFS fileservers, and those realms can be used nearly interchangeably. A
       site may list "FOO.EXAMPLE.COM" and "BAR.EXAMPLE.COM" to allow users to access AFS by using Kerberos
       tickets from either "FOO.EXAMPLE.COM" or "BAR.EXAMPLE.COM", and be treated as AFS users local to that
       cell.

       In many setups, one realm is really a `local' realm that is managed by the AFS administrators, and
       another `foreign' realm is specified in <u>krb.conf</u> that is managed by someone else, but in the same
       organization.  In such a case, the principal names for users are the same, so users should be able to use
       either realm to authenticate to AFS.  However, the principals for administrators are not the same between
       the two realms, and so the administrators in the `foreign' realm should not be considered AFS
       administrators. Specifying the administrator principals in the `foreign' realm prevents this, but still
       allows users to use either realm.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The realms "FOO.EXAMPLE.COM" and "AD.EXAMPLE.COM" are configured to both be local realms, but
       "AD.EXAMPLE.COM" should not be used by AFS administrators. The AFS administrators are "admin" and
       "smith.admin".  <u>krb.excl</u> contains:

          <a href="mailto:admin@AD.EXAMPLE.COM">admin@AD.EXAMPLE.COM</a>
          <a href="mailto:smith.admin@AD.EXAMPLE.COM">smith.admin@AD.EXAMPLE.COM</a>

       Now if someone authenticates with tickets for "smith/<a href="mailto:admin@AD.EXAMPLE.COM">admin@AD.EXAMPLE.COM</a>", they will not be recognized
       as the "smith.admin" AFS identity. However, "<a href="mailto:smith@AD.EXAMPLE.COM">smith@AD.EXAMPLE.COM</a>" will be treated as the "smith" AFS
       identity, and "smith/<a href="mailto:admin@FOO.EXAMPLE.COM">admin@FOO.EXAMPLE.COM</a>" will still be treated as "smith.admin".
