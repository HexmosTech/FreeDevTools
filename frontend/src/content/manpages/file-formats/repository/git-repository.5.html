</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-repository — Git repository format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  Git  repository  stores  a  series  of  versioned  snapshots  of  a file hierarchy.  Conceptually, the
       repository's data model is a directed acyclic graph which contains four types of objects as nodes:

       Blobs    The content of tracked files is stored in objects of type <u>blob</u>.

       Trees    A <u>tree</u> object points to any number of such blobs, and also to other trees in order to  represent
                a hierarchy of files and directories.

       Commits  A  <u>commit</u>  object  points  to  the  root element of one tree, and thus records the state of this
                entire tree as a snapshot.  Commit objects are chained together to form lines of version control
                history.  Most commits have just one successor commit,  but  commits  may  be  succeeded  by  an
                arbitrary number of subsequent commits so that diverging lines of version control history, known
                as  <u>branches</u>, can be represented.  A commit which precedes another commit is referred to as that
                other commit's <u>parent</u> <u>commit</u>.  A commit with multiple parents unites disparate lines of  history
                and is known as a <u>merge</u> <u>commit</u>.

       Tags     A  <u>tag</u>  object  associates a user-defined label with another object, which is typically a commit
                object.  Tag objects also contain a tag message, as well as author and timestamp information.

       Each object is identified by an hash calculated over both the object's header and the data stored in  the
       object.   The  hashing  algorithm  used is specified in the repository <u>config</u> file for newer repositories
       while older ones use SHA1 implicitly.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>STORAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Loose objects are stored as individual files beneath  the  directory  <u>objects</u>,  spread  across  256  sub-
       directories  named  after  the 256 possible hexadecimal values of the first byte of an object identifier.
       The name of the loose object file corresponds to the remaining hexadecimal byte values  of  the  object's
       identifier.

       A  loose object file begins with a header which specifies the type of object as an ASCII string, followed
       by an ASCII space character, followed by the object data's size encoded as an ASCII number  string.   The
       header  is  terminated  by  a  <b>NUL</b>  character, and the remainder of the file contains object data.  Loose
       objects files are compressed with <u><a href="../man3/deflate.3.html">deflate</a></u>(3).

       Multiple objects can be bundled in a <u>pack</u> <u>file</u> for better disk space efficiency  and  increased  run-time
       performance.  The pack file format introduces two additional types of objects:

       Offset Delta Objects
               This  object  is represented as a delta against another object in the same pack file.  This other
               object is referred to by its offset in the pack file.

       Reference Delta Objects
               This object is represented as a delta against another object in the same pack  file.   The  other
               object is referred to by its object identifier.

       Pack  files  are self-contained and may not refer to loose objects or objects stored in other pack files.
       Deltified objects may refer to other deltified objects as their delta base,  forming  chains  of  deltas.
       The  ultimate  base  of  a delta chain must be an object of the same type as the original object which is
       stored in deltified form.

       Each pack file is accompanied by a corresponding <u>pack</u> <u>index</u> file, which lists the IDs and offsets of  all
       objects contained in the pack file.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       A  reference  associates  a  name with an object ID.  A prominent use of references is providing names to
       branches in the repository by pointing at commit objects which represent the  current  tip  commit  of  a
       branch.  Because references may point to arbitrary object IDs, their use is not limited to branches.

       The name is a UTF-8 string with the following disallowed characters: ‘ ’ (space), ~ (tilde), ^ (caret), :
       (colon),  ?  (question mark), * (asterisk), [ (opening square bracket), \ (backslash).  Additionally, the
       name may not contain the two-character sequences //, .. , and @{.

       Reference names may optionally have multiple components separated by the / (slash) character,  forming  a
       hierarchy of reference namespaces.  Got reserves the <u>refs/got/</u> reference namespace for internal use.

       A symbolic reference associates a name with the name of another reference.  The most prominent example is
       the <u>HEAD</u> reference which points at the name of the repository's default branch reference.

       References  are stored either as a plain file within the repository, typically under the <u>refs/</u> directory,
       or in the <u>packed-refs</u> file which contains one reference definition per line.

       Any object which is not directly or indirectly reachable via a reference is subject to deletion by  Git's
       garbage collector or <b>gotadmin</b> <b>cleanup</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>HEAD</u>         A  reference  to  the  current head commit of the Git work tree.  In bare repositories, this
                    file serves as a default reference.
       <u>ORIG_HEAD</u>    Reference to original head commit.  Set by some Git operations.
       <u>FETCH_HEAD</u>   Reference to a branch tip commit most recently fetched from another repository.
       <u>branches/</u>    Legacy directory used by the deprecated Gogito Git interface.
       <u>config</u>       Git configuration file.  See <u><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></u>(1).
       <u>description</u>  A human-readable description of the repository.
       <u>got.conf</u>     Configuration file for <u><a href="../man1/got.1.html">got</a></u>(1).  See <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5).
       <u>hooks/</u>       This directory contains hook scripts to run when certain events occur.
       <u>index</u>        The file index  used  by  <u><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></u>(1).   This  file  is  not  used  by  <u><a href="../man1/got.1.html">got</a></u>(1),  which  uses  the
                    <u><a href="../man5/got-worktree.5.html">got-worktree</a></u>(5) file index instead.
       <u>info</u>         Various configuration items.
       <u>logs/</u>        Directory where reflogs are stored.
       <u>objects/</u>     Loose and packed objects are stored in this directory.
       <u>packed-refs</u>  A file which stores references.  Corresponding on-disk references take precedence over those
                    stored here.
       <u>refs/</u>        The default directory to store references in.

       A typical Git repository exposes a work tree which allows the user to make changes to versioned files and
       create  new  commits.   When  a  Git work tree is present, the actual repository data is stored in a <u>.git</u>
       subfolder of the repository's root directory.  A Git repository without a work tree is known as a  “bare”
       repository.  <u><a href="../man1/got.1.html">got</a></u>(1) does not make use of Git's work tree and treats every repository as if it was bare.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The Git repository format was initially designed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has since been extended by
       various people involved in the development of the Git version control system.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The  particular  set  of disallowed characters in reference names is a consequence of design choices made
       for the command-line interface of <u><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></u>(1).  The same characters are disallowed by  Got  for  compatibility
       purposes.   Got  additionally  prevents  users  from  creating  reference  names  with a leading - (dash)
       character, because this is rarely intended and not considered useful.
