</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gvpe.conf - configuration file for the GNU VPE daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          # global options for all nodes
          udp-port = 407
          mtu = 1492
          ifname = vpn0

          # first node is named branch1 and is at 1.2.3.4
          node = branch1
          hostname = 1.2.3.4

          # second node uses dns to resolve the address
          node = branch2
          hostname = www.example.net
          udp-port = 500       # this host uses a different udp-port

          # third node has no fixed ip address
          node = branch3
          connect = ondemand

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The gvpe config file consists of a series of lines that contain variable = value pairs. Empty lines are
       ignored. Comments start with a # and extend to the end of the line. They can be used on their own lines,
       or after any directives. Whitespace is allowed around the = sign or after values, but not within the
       variable names or values themselves.

       All settings are applied "in order", that is, later settings of the same variable overwrite earlier ones.

       The only exceptions to the above are the following directives:

       node nodename
           Introduces  a node section. The nodename is used to select the right configuration section and is the
           same string as is passed as an argument to the gvpe daemon.

           Multiple node statements with the same node name are supported and will be merged together.

       global
           This statement switches back to the global section, which is mainly useful if you want to  include  a
           second config file, e..g for local customisations. To do that, simply include this at the very end of
           your config file:

              global
              include local.conf

       on nodename ...
       on !nodename ...
           You  can  prefix any configuration directive with on and a nodename. GVPE will will only "execute" it
           on the named node, or (if the nodename starts with !) on all nodes except the named one.

           Example: set the MTU to 1450 everywhere, loglevel to  noise  on  branch1,  and  connect  to  ondemand
           everywhere but on branch2.

              mtu = 1450
              on branch1 loglevel = noise
              on !branch2 connect = ondemand

       include relative-or-absolute-path
           Reads  the  specified  file  (the  path must not contain whitespace or = characters) and evaluate all
           config directives in it as if they were spelled out in place of the include directive.

           The path is a printf format string, that is, you must escape any % by doubling it, and you can have a
           single %s inside, which will be replaced by the current nodename.

           Relative paths are interpreted relative to the GVPE config directory.

           Example: include the file <u>local.conf</u> in the config directory on every node.

              include local.conf

           Example: include a file <u>conf/</u>nodename<u>.conf</u>

              include conf/%s.conf

</pre><h4><b>ANATOMY</b> <b>OF</b> <b>A</b> <b>CONFIG</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Usually, a config file starts with a few global settings (like the UDP port to listen  on),  followed  by
       node-specific sections that begin with a node = nickname line.

       Every  node  that is part of the network must have a section that starts with node = nickname. The number
       and order of the nodes is important and must be the same on all  nodes.  It  is  not  uncommon  for  node
       sections to be completely empty - if the default values are right.

       Node-specific  settings  can be used at any time. If used before the first node section they will set the
       default values for all following nodes.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIG</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>GLOBAL</b> <b>SETTINGS</b>
       Global settings will affect the behaviour of the running gvpe daemon, that is, they  are  in  some  sense
       node-specific  (config  files  can set different values on different nodes using on), but will affect the
       behaviour of the gvpe daemon and all connections it creates.

       chroot = path or /
           Tells GVPE to <u><a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</a></u>(2) to the specified path after reading all necessary files, binding  to  sockets
           and running the if-up script, but before running node-up or any other scripts.

           The  special  path <u>/</u> instructs GVPE to create (and remove) an empty temporary directory to use as new
           root. This is most secure, but makes it impossible to use any scripts other than the if-up one.

       chuid = numerical-uid
       chgid = numerical-gid
           These two options tell GVPE to change to the given user and/or group id after reading  all  necessary
           files, binding to sockets and running the if-up script.

           Other scripts, such as node-up, are run with the new user id or group id.

       chuser = username
           Alternative  to chuid and chgid: Sets both chuid and chgid to the user and (primary) group ids of the
           specified user (for example, nobody).

       dns-forw-host = hostname/ip
           The DNS server to forward DNS requests to for the DNS tunnel protocol (default:  127.0.0.1,  changing
           it is highly recommended).

       dns-forw-port = port-number
           The port where the dns-forw-host is to be contacted (default: 53, which is fine in most cases).

       dns-case-preserving = yes|true|on | no|false|off
           Sets whether the DNS transport forwarding server preserves case (DNS servers have to, but some access
           systems are even more broken than others) (default: true).

           Normally,  when  the  forwarding server changes the case of domain names then GVPE will automatically
           set this to false.

       dns-max-outstanding = integer-number-of-requests
           The maximum number of outstanding DNS transport requests (default: 100). GVPE will never  issue  more
           requests  then  the  given limit without receiving replies. In heavily overloaded situations it might
           help to set this to a low number (e.g. 3 or even 1) to limit the number of parallel requests.

           The default should be working OK for most links.

       dns-overlap-factor = float
           The DNS transport uses the minimum request latency (<b>min_latency</b>) seen during  a  connection  as  it's
           timing  base. This factor (default: 0.5, must be &gt; 0) is multiplied by <b>min_latency</b> to get the maximum
           sending rate (= minimum send interval), i.e. a factor  of  1  means  that  a  new  request  might  be
           generated every <b>min_latency</b> seconds, which means on average there should only ever be one outstanding
           request.   A  factor  of 0.5 means that GVPE will send requests twice as often as the minimum latency
           measured.

           For congested or picky DNS forwarders you could use a value nearer to or exceeding 1.

           The default should be working OK for most links.

       dns-send-interval = send-interval-in-seconds
           The minimum send interval (= maximum rate) that the DNS transport will use to send new DNS  requests.
           GVPE  will  not  exceed this rate even when the latency is very low. The default is 0.01, which means
           GVPE will not send more than 100 DNS requests per connection per second. For high-bandwidth links you
           could go lower, e.g. to 0.001 or so. For congested or  rate-limited  links,  you  might  want  to  go
           higher, say 0.1, 0.2 or even higher.

           The default should be working OK for most links.

       dns-timeout-factor = float
           Factor  to  multiply the min_latency (see dns-overlap-factor) by to get request timeouts. The default
           of 8 means that the DNS transport will resend the request when no reply has been received for  longer
           than eight times the minimum (= expected) latency, assuming the request or reply has been lost.

           For  congested  links  a  higher value might be necessary (e.g. 30). If the link is very stable lower
           values (e.g. 2) might work nicely. Values near or below 1 makes no sense whatsoever.

           The default should be working OK for most links but will result in low throughput if packet  loss  is
           high.

       if-up = relative-or-absolute-path
           Sets  the  path  of  a  script  that  should  be  called  immediately  after the network interface is
           initialized (but not necessarily up). The following environment  variables  are  passed  to  it  (the
           values are just examples).

           Variables that have the same value on all nodes:

           CONFBASE=/etc/gvpe
               The configuration base directory.

           IFNAME=vpn0
               The network interface to initialize.

           IFTYPE=native # or tincd
           IFSUBTYPE=linux # or freebsd, darwin etc..
               The interface type (native or tincd) and the subtype (usually the OS name in lowercase) that this
               GVPE  was  configured  for.  Can  be used to select the correct syntax to use for network-related
               commands.

           MTU=1436
               The MTU to set the interface to. You can use lower values (if done consistently  on  all  nodes),
               but this is usually either inefficient or simply ineffective.

           NODES=5
               The number of nodes in this GVPE network.

           Variables that are node-specific and with values pertaining to the node running this GVPE:

           IFUPDATA=string
               The value of the configuration directive if-up-data.

           MAC=fe:fd:80:00:00:01
               The MAC address the network interface has to use.

               Might  be  used  to initialize interfaces on platforms where GVPE does not do this automatically.
               Please see the <a href="../man5/gvpe.osdep.5.html">gvpe.osdep</a>(5) man page for platform-specific information.

           NODENAME=branch1
               The nickname of the node.

           NODEID=1
               The numerical node ID of the node running this instance of GVPE. The first node mentioned in  the
               config file gets ID 1, the second ID 2 and so on.

           In addition, all node-specific variables (except NODEID) will be available with a postfix of _nodeid,
           which  contains the value for that node, e.g. the MAC_1 variable contains the MAC address of node #1,
           while the NODENAME_22 variable contains the name of node #22.

           Here is a simple if-up script:

              #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
              ip link set $IFNAME up
              [ $NODENAME = branch1 ] &amp;&amp; ip addr add 10.0.0.1 dev $IFNAME
              [ $NODENAME = branch2 ] &amp;&amp; ip addr add 10.1.0.1 dev $IFNAME
              ip route add 10.0.0.0/8 dev $IFNAME

           More complicated examples (using routing to reduce ARP traffic) can be found in the <u>etc/</u> subdirectory
           of the distribution.

       ifname = devname
           Sets the tun interface name to the given name. The default is OS-specific and most probably something
           like tun0.

       ifpersist = yes|true|on | no|false|off
           Should the tun/tap device be made persistent, that is, should the  device  stay  up  even  when  gvpe
           exits?  Some  versions  of  the tunnel device have problems sending packets when gvpe is restarted in
           persistent mode, so if the connections can be established but you cannot send packets from the  local
           node, try to set this to off and do an ifconfig down on the device.

       ip-proto = numerical-ip-protocol
           Sets the protocol number to be used for the rawip protocol. This is a global option because all nodes
           must  use the same protocol, and since there are no port numbers, you cannot easily run more than one
           gvpe instance using the same protocol, nor can you share the protocol with other programs.

           The default is 47 (GRE), which has a good chance of tunneling through firewalls (but note that gvpe's
           rawip protocol is not GRE compatible). Other common choices are 50 (IPSEC, ESP), 51  (IPSEC,  AH),  4
           (IPIP tunnels) or 98 (ENCAP, rfc1241).

           Many  versions  of Linux seem to have a bug that causes them to reorder packets for some ip protocols
           (GRE, ESP) but not for others (AH), so choose wisely (that is, use 51, AH).

       http-proxy-host = hostname/ip
           The  http-proxy-*  family  of  options  are  only  available  if   gvpe   was   compiled   with   the
           --enable-http-proxy option and enable tunneling of tcp connections through a http proxy server.

           http-proxy-host  and http-proxy-port should specify the hostname and port number of the proxy server.
           See http-proxy-loginpw if your proxy requires authentication.

           Please note that gvpe will still try to resolve all hostnames in the configuration file,  so  if  you
           are behind a proxy without access to a DNS server better use numerical IP addresses.

           To  make  best  use of this option disable all protocols except TCP in your config file and make sure
           your routers (or all other nodes) are listening on a port that the proxy allows  (443,  https,  is  a
           common choice).

           If you have a router, connecting to it will suffice. Otherwise TCP must be enabled on all nodes.

           Example:

              http-proxy-host = proxy.example.com
              http-proxy-port = 3128       # 8080 is another common choice
              http-proxy-auth = schmorp:grumbeere

       http-proxy-port = proxy-tcp-port
           The port where your proxy server listens.

       http-proxy-auth = login:password
           The  optional  login  and  password  used to authenticate to the proxy server, separated by a literal
           colon (:). Only basic authentication is currently supported.

       keepalive = seconds
           Sets the keepalive probe interval in seconds (default: 60). After this many seconds of inactivity the
           daemon will start to send keepalive probe every 3 seconds until it receives a reply  from  the  other
           end. If no reply is received within 15 seconds, the peer is considered unreachable and the connection
           is closed.

       loglevel = noise|trace|debug|info|notice|warn|error|critical
           Set  the  logging level. Connection established messages are logged at level info, notable errors are
           logged with error. Default is info.

       mtu = bytes
           Sets the maximum MTU that should be used on outgoing packets  (basically  the  MTU  of  the  outgoing
           interface) The daemon will automatically calculate maximum overhead (e.g. UDP header size, encryption
           blocksize...) and pass this information to the if-up script.

           Recommended values are 1500 (ethernet), 1492 (pppoe), 1472 (pptp).

           This value must be the minimum of the MTU values of all nodes.

       nfmark = integer
           This  advanced  option, when set to a nonzero value (default: 0), tries to set the netfilter mark (or
           fwmark) value on all sockets gvpe uses to send packets.

           This can be used to make gvpe use a different set of routing rules. For example,  on  GNU/Linux,  the
           if-up  could  set nfmark to 1000 and then put all routing rules into table 99 and then use an ip rule
           to make gvpe traffic avoid that routing table, in effect routing normal traffic  via  gvpe  and  gvpe
           traffic via the normal system routing tables:

              ip rule add not fwmark 1000 lookup 99

       node-up = relative-or-absolute-path
           Sets  a  command  (default: none) that should be called whenever a connection is established (even on
           rekeying operations). Note that node-up/down scripts will be run  asynchronously,  but  execution  is
           serialised, so there will only ever be one such script running.

           In addition to all the variables passed to if-up scripts, the following environment variables will be
           set (values are just examples):

           DESTNODE=branch2
               The name of the remote node.

           DESTID=2
               The node id of the remote node.

           DESTSI=rawip/88.99.77.55:0
               The   "socket   info"  of  the  target  node,  protocol  dependent  but  usually  in  the  format
               protocol/ip:port.

           DESTIP=188.13.66.8
               The numerical IP address of the remote node (gvpe accepts connections from everywhere, as long as
               the other node can authenticate itself).

           DESTPORT=655 # deprecated
               The protocol port used by the other side, if applicable.

           STATE=up
               Node-up scripts get called with STATE=up, node-change scripts get called  with  STATE=change  and
               node-down scripts get called with STATE=down.

           Here is a nontrivial example that uses nsupdate to update the name =&gt; ip mapping in some DNS zone:

              #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
              {
                echo update delete $DESTNODE.lowttl.example.net. a
                echo update add $DESTNODE.lowttl.example.net. 1 in a $DESTIP
                echo
              } | nsupdate -d -k $CONFBASE:key.example.net.

       node-change = relative-or-absolute-path
           Same  as  node-change,  but  gets  called  whenever something about a connection changes (such as the
           source IP address).

       node-down = relative-or-absolute-path
           Same as node-up, but gets called whenever a connection is lost.

       pid-file = path
           The path to the pid file to check and create (default: LOCALSTATEDIR/run/gvpe.pid). The first  %s  is
           replaced by the nodename - any other use of % must be written as %%.

       private-key = relative-path-to-key
           Sets  the  path  (relative  to the config directory) to the private key (default: hostkey). This is a
           printf format string so every % must be doubled. A single %s is replaced  by  the  hostname,  so  you
           could use paths like hostkeys/%s to be able to share the same config directory between nodes.

           Since  only  the private key file of the current node is used and the private key file should be kept
           secret per-node to avoid spoofing, it is not recommended to use this feature this way though.

       rekey = seconds
           Sets the rekeying interval in seconds (default: 3607).  Connections  are  reestablished  every  rekey
           seconds, making them use a new encryption key.

       seed-device = path
           The  random  device  used  to  initially  and  regularly  seed  the random number generator (default:
           <u>/dev/urandom</u>). Randomness is of paramount importance to the security of the algorithms used in gvpe.

           On program start and every seed-interval, gvpe will read 64 octets.

           Setting this path to the empty string will disable  this  functionality  completely  (the  underlying
           crypto library will likely look for entropy sources on it's own though, so not all is lost).

       seed-interval = seconds
           The  number  of  seconds between reseeds of the random number generator (default: 3613). A value of 0
           disables this regular reseeding.

       serial = string
           The configuration serial number. This can be any string up to 16 bytes length. Only when  the  serial
           matches  on  both sides of a connection will the connection succeed. This is <u>not</u> a security mechanism
           and eay to spoof, this mechanism exists to alert users that their config is outdated.

           It's recommended to specify this is a date string such as 2013-05-05 or 20121205084417.

           The exact algorithm is as this: if a connection request is received form a  node  with  an  identical
           serial, then it succeeds normally.

           If the remote serial is lower than the local serial, it is ignored.

           If the remote serial is higher than the local serial, a warning message is logged.

   <b>NODE</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>SETTINGS</b>
       The  following  settings  are node-specific, that is, every node can have different settings, even within
       the same gvpe instance. Settings that are set before the first node section set  the  defaults,  settings
       that are set within a node section only apply to the given node.

       allow-direct = nodename
           Allow direct connections to this node. See deny-direct for more info.

       compress = yes|true|on | no|false|off
           For  the  current  node,  this specified whether it will accept compressed packets, and for all other
           nodes, this specifies whether to try to compress data packets  sent  to  this  node  (default:  yes).
           Compression is really cheap even on slow computers, has no size overhead at all and will only be used
           when the other side supports compression, so enabling this is often a good idea.

       connect = ondemand | never | always | disabled
           Sets  the  connect  mode  (default:  always).  It  can  be always (always try to establish and keep a
           connection to the given node), never (never initiate a connection  to  the  given  host,  but  accept
           connections), ondemand (try to establish a connection when there are outstanding packets in the queue
           and take it down after the keepalive interval) or disabled (node is bad, don't talk to it).

           Routers will automatically be forced to always unless they are disabled, to ensure all nodes can talk
           to each other.

       deny-direct = nodename | *
           Deny  direct  connections  to the specified node (or all nodes when * is given). Only one node can be
           specified, but you can use multiple allow-direct and deny-direct statements. This only makes sense in
           networks with routers, as routers are required for indirect connections.

           Sometimes, a node cannot reach some other nodes for reasons of network connectivity. For  example,  a
           node  behind  a  firewall that only allows connections to/from a single other node in the network. In
           this case one should specify deny-direct = * and allow-direct = othernodename (the other node <u>must</u> be
           a router for this to work).

           The algorithm to check whether a connection may be direct is as follows:

           1. Other node mentioned in an allow-direct? If yes, allow the connection.

           2. Other node mentioned in a deny-direct? If yes, deny direct connections.

           3. Allow the connection.

           That is, allow-direct takes precedence over deny-direct.

           The check is done in both directions, i.e. both nodes must allow a direct connection  before  one  is
           attempted, so you only need to specify connect limitations on one node.

       dns-domain = domain-suffix
           The DNS domain suffix that points to the DNS tunnel server for this node.

           The domain must point to a NS record that points to the <u>dns-hostname</u>, i.e.

              dns-domainname = tunnel.example.net
              dns-hostname   = tunnel-server.example.net

           Corresponds to the following DNS entries in the example.net domain:

              tunnel.example.net.         NS tunnel-server.example.net.
              tunnel-server.example.net.  A  13.13.13.13

       dns-hostname = hostname/ip
           The  address  to  bind  the  DNS  tunnel  socket  to, similar to the hostname, but for the DNS tunnel
           protocol only. Default: 0.0.0.0, but that might change.

       dns-port = port-number
           The port to bind the DNS tunnel socket to. Must be 53 on DNS tunnel servers.

       enable-dns = yes|true|on | no|false|off
           See <u><a href="../man7/gvpe.protocol.7.html">gvpe.protocol</a></u>(7) for a description of the DNS transport protocol. Avoid this protocol if you can.

           Enable the DNS tunneling protocol on this node, either as server  or  as  client.  Support  for  this
           transport protocol is only available when gvpe was compiled using the --enable-dns option.

       enable-icmp = yes|true|on | no|false|off
           See <u><a href="../man7/gvpe.protocol.7.html">gvpe.protocol</a></u>(7) for a description of the ICMP transport protocol.

           Enable the ICMP transport using ICMP packets of type icmp-type on this node.

       enable-rawip = yes|true|on | no|false|off
           See <u><a href="../man7/gvpe.protocol.7.html">gvpe.protocol</a></u>(7) for a description of the RAW IP transport protocol.

           Enable the RAW IPv4 transport using the ip-proto protocol (default: no).

       enable-tcp = yes|true|on | no|false|off
           See <u><a href="../man7/gvpe.protocol.7.html">gvpe.protocol</a></u>(7) for a description of the TCP transport protocol.

           Enable the TCPv4 transport using the tcp-port port (default: no). Support for this transport protocol
           is only available when gvpe was compiled using the --enable-tcp option.

       enable-udp = yes|true|on | no|false|off
           See <u><a href="../man7/gvpe.protocol.7.html">gvpe.protocol</a></u>(7) for a description of the UDP transport protocol.

           Enable the UDPv4 transport using the udp-port port (default: no).

       hostname = hostname | ip    [can not be defaulted]
           Forces  the  address  of  this  node  to  be  set to the given DNS hostname or IP address. It will be
           resolved before each connect request, so dyndns should work fine. If this setting  is  not  specified
           and  a  router is available, then the router will be queried for the address of this node. Otherwise,
           the connection attempt will fail.

           Note that DNS resolving is done synchronously, pausing the daemon. If that is an issue  you  need  to
           specify IP addresses.

       icmp-type = integer
           Sets the type value to be used for outgoing (and incoming) packets sent via the ICMP transport.

           The  default  is  0  (which is echo-reply, also known as "ping-reply"). Other useful values include 8
           (echo-request, a.k.a.  "ping") and 11 (time-exceeded), but any 8-bit value can be used.

       if-up-data = value
           The value specified using this directive will be passed  to  the  if-up  script  in  the  environment
           variable IFUPDATA.

       inherit-tos = yes|true|on | no|false|off
           Whether  to  inherit the TOS settings of packets sent to the tunnel when sending packets to this node
           (default: yes). If set to yes then outgoing tunnel packets will have the  same  TOS  setting  as  the
           packets sent to the tunnel device, which is usually what you want.

       low-power = yes|true|on | no|false|off
           If true, designates a node as a low-power node. Low-power nodes use larger timeouts and try to reduce
           cpu  time.  Other  nodes talking to a low-power node will also use larger timeouts, and will use less
           aggressive optimisations, in the hope of reducing load. Security is not compromised.

           The typical low-power node would be a mobile phone, where wakeups and  encryption  can  significantly
           increase power drain.

       max-retry = positive-number
           The  maximum  interval in seconds (default: 3600, one hour) between retries to establish a connection
           to this node. When a connection cannot be established, gvpe uses exponential back-off capped at  this
           value.  It's  sometimes useful to set this to a much lower value (e.g. 120) on connections to routers
           that usually are stable but sometimes are down, to  assure  quick  reconnections  even  after  longer
           downtimes.

       max-ttl = seconds
           Expire  packets that couldn't be sent after this many seconds (default: 60). Gvpe will normally queue
           packets for a node without an active connection, in the hope of establishing a connection soon.  This
           value specifies the maximum lifetime a packet will stay in the queue, if a packet gets older, it will
           be thrown away.

       max-queue = positive-number&gt;=1
           The  maximum  number of packets that will be queued (default: 512) for this node. If more packets are
           sent then earlier packets will be expired. See max-ttl, above.

       router-priority = 0 | 1 | positive-number&gt;=2
           Sets the router priority of the given node (default: 0, disabled).

           If some node tries to connect to another node but it doesn't have a hostname, it asks a  router  node
           for  it's  IP address. The router node chosen is the one with the highest priority larger than 1 that
           is currently reachable. This is called a <u>mediated</u> connection, as the connection itself will still  be
           direct, but it uses another node to mediate between the two nodes.

           The  value  0  disables  routing, that means if the node receives a packet not for itself it will not
           forward it but instead drop it.

           The special value 1 allows other hosts to route through the router host, but they  will  never  route
           through it by default (i.e. the config file of another node needs to specify a router priority higher
           than one to choose such a node for routing).

           The  idea behind this is that some hosts can, if required, bump the router-priority setting to higher
           than 1 in their local config to route through specific hosts. If router-priority is 0,  then  routing
           will be refused, so 1 serves as a "enable, but do not use by default" switch.

           Nodes  with router-priority set to 2 or higher will always be forced to connect = always (unless they
           are disabled).

       tcp-port = port-number
           Similar to udp-port (default: 655), but sets the TCP port number.

       udp-port = port-number
           Sets the port number used by the UDP protocol (default: 655, not officially assigned by IANA!).
