       xymonserver.cfg - Xymon environment variables

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Xymon  programs  use  multiple environment variables beside the normal set of variables.  The environment
       definitions are stored in the ~Xymon/server/etc/xymonserver.cfg file.  Each line in this file is  of  the
       form <b>NAME=VALUE</b> and defines one environment variable NAME with the value VALUE.

       You  can  also append data to existing variables, using the syntax <b>NAME+=VALUE</b>. VALUE is then appended to
       the existing value of the NAME variable. If NAME has not been defined, then this acts as  if  it  were  a
       normal definition.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>AREAS</b></h4><pre>
       In  some  cases it may be useful to have different values for an environment variable, depending on where
       it is used. This is possible by defining variables with an associated "area". Such definitions  have  the
       form <b>AREA/NAME=VALUE</b>.

       E.g.  to  define  a  special  setup  of  the XYMSERVERS variable when it is used by an application in the
       "management" area, you would do this:

                XYMSERVERS="127.0.0.1"            # Default definition
                management/XYMSERVERS="10.1.0.5"  # Definition in the "management" area

       Areas are invoked by using the "--area" option  for  all  tools,  or  via  the  ENVAREA  setting  in  the
       <u><a href="../man5/tasks.cfg.5.html">tasks.cfg</a>(5)</u> file.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       XYMONSERVERHOSTNAME
              The fully-qualified hostname of the server that is running Xymon.

       XYMONSERVERWWWNAME
              The  hostname  used  to  access  this  servers'  web-pages,  used  to construct URL's in the Xymon
              webpages. Default is the XYMONSERVERHOSTNAME.

       XYMONSERVERIP
              The public IP-address of the server that is running Xymon.

       XYMONSERVEROS
              A name identifying the operating system of  the  Xymon  server.  The  known  names  are  currently
              "linux", "freebsd", "solaris", "hpux", "aix" and "osf".

       FQDN   If  set  to TRUE, Xymon will use fully-qualified hostnames throughout.  If set to FALSE, hostnames
              are stripped of their domain-part before being processed. It is <b>highly</b> <b>recommended</b> that  you  keep
              this set to TRUE. Default: TRUE.

       XYMONLOGSTATUS
              Controls  how  the  HTML  page for a status log is generated. If set to DYNAMIC, the HTML logs are
              generated on-demand by the <u><a href="../man1/svcstatus.cgi.1.html">svcstatus.cgi</a>(1)</u> script. If  set  to  STATIC,  you  must  activate  the
              <u><a href="../man8/xymond_filestore.8.html">xymond_filestore</a>(8)</u>  module  (through  an  entry in the <u><a href="../man5/tasks.cfg.5.html">tasks.cfg</a>(5)</u> file) to create and store the
              HTML logs whenever a status update is received.  Setting  "XYMONLOGSTATUS=STATIC"  is  <b>discouraged</b>
              since the I/O load on the Xymon server will increase significantly.

       PINGCOLUMN
              Defines  the  name  of  the  column  for "ping" test status. The data from the "ping" test is used
              internally by Xymon, so it must be defined here so all of the Xymon tools  know  which  column  to
              watch for this data. The default setting is PINGCOLUMN=conn.

       INFOCOLUMN
              Defines the name of the column for the "info" pages.

       TRENDSCOLUMN
              Defines the name of the column for the RRD graph pages.

       RRDHEIGHT
              The default height (in pixels) of the RRD graph images.  Default: 120 pixels.

       RRDWIDTH
              The default width (in pixels) of the RRD graph images.  Default: 576 pixels.

       RRDGRAPHOPTS
              Extra  options for the RRD graph command. These are passed directly to the "rrdgraph" command used
              to generate graphs, see the <u><a href="../man1/rrdgraph.1.html">rrdgraph</a>(1)</u> man-page for details of the options.

       TRENDSECONDS
              The graphs on the "trends" page show data for  the  past  TRENDSECONDS  seconds.  Default:  172800
              seconds, i.e. 48 hours.

       HTMLCONTENTTYPE
              The  Content-type  reported  by  the  CGI  scripts  that  generate web pages.  By default, this it
              "text/html". If you have on-line help texts in character sets other than the  ISO-8859-1  (western
              european) character set, it may be necessary to modify this to include a character set.  E.g.
                 HTMLCONTENTTYPE="text/html; charset=euc-jp"
              for a Japanese character sets. Note: Some webservers will automatically add this, if configured to
              do so.

       XYMWEBREFRESH
              The  default  HTTP  page reload interval for many xymongen and status pages.  Note that while this
              can be overridden in the header template files for regular  pages,  dynamically  generated  status
              logs  displayed  with <a href="../man1/svcstatus.cgi.1.html">svcstatus.cgi</a>(1) use this value in the HTTP response header and for security
              reasons the value in hostsvc_header may be ignored on many modern  browsers.  (default  [seconds]:
              60)

       HOLIDAYS
              Defines the default set of holidays used if there is no "holidays" tag for a host in the hosts.cfg
              file.  Holiday  sets  are  defined  in  the <u><a href="../man5/holidays.cfg.5.html">holidays.cfg</a>(5)</u> file. If not defined, only the default
              holidays (those defined outside a named holiday set) will be considered as holidays.

       WEEKSTART
              Defines which day is the first day of the week. Set to "0" for Sunday, "1" for Monday. Default:  1
              (Monday).

       XYMONBODYHEADER
              Text   that   is   included   in   the   Xymon   web   pages   at   the   location   specified  by
              ~xymon/server/web/*_header templates. If this is set to a value beginning with "file:",  then  the
              contents of the specified file is included. Default: "file:$XYMONHOME/etc/xymonmenu.cfg"

       XYMONBODYFOOTER
              Text   that   is   included   in   the   Xymon   web   pages   at   the   location   specified  by
              ~xymon/server/web/*_footer templates. If this is set to a value beginning with "file:",  then  the
              contents of the specified file is included. Default: Empty.

       XYMONBODYMENUCSS
              URL for the Xymon menu CSS file. Default: "$XYMONMENUSKIN/xymonmenu.css"

       HOSTPOPUP
              Determines  what  is used as the host comment on the webpages. The comment by default appears as a
              pop-up when the mouse hovers over the hostname, and is also shown on the "info" status page.  This
              setting  must  be one or more of the letters "C" (COMMENT), "D" (DESCRIPTION) or "I" (IP-address).
              Including "C" uses the COMMENT setting for the host, including "D" uses the DESCR setting for  the
              host,  and  "I"  uses  the IP-address of the host.  If more than one of these is set, then COMMENT
              takes precedence over DESCR which again has precedence over IP.   Note  that  DESCR  and  IP  only
              appear  in pop-up windows (if enabled), whereas the COMMENT is always used - if pop-up's have been
              disabled, then the COMMENT value is displayed next to the hostname on the webpages.  Default: CDI

       STATUSLIFETIME
              The number of minutes that a status is considered valid after an update.  After this time elapses,
              the status will go purple.  Default: 30 minutes

</pre><h4><b>DIRECTORIES</b></h4><pre>
       XYMONSERVERROOT
              The top-level directory for the Xymon installation. The default is the home-directory for the user
              running Xymon.

       XYMONSNAPDIR
              Directory  for  Xymon snapshots. The $XYMONSNAPURL URL must map to this directory.  Note also that
              your webserver must have write-access to this directory, if you want to  use  the  <u><a href="../man1/snapshot.cgi.1.html">snapshot.cgi</a>(1)</u>
              CGI script to generate snapshots on-demand. Default: $XYMONHOME/www/snap/

       XYMONVAR
              Directory for all data stored about the monitored items.  Default: $XYMONSERVERROOT/data/

       XYMONRAWSTATUSDIR
              Directory for storing the raw status-logs. Not used unless "xymond_filestore --status" is running,
              which  is  <b>discouraged</b>  since  it  increases the load on the Xymon server significantly.  Default:
              $XYMONVAR/logs/

       XYMONHTMLSTATUSDIR
              Directory for storing HTML status-logs. Not used  unless  "xymond_filestore  --status  --html"  is

              Default: $XYMONHOME/www/html/

       XYMONHISTDIR
              Directory for storing the history of monitored items.  Default: $XYMONVAR/hist/

              Directory for storing the detailed status-log of historical events.  Default: $XYMONVAR/histlogs/

       XYMONACKDIR
              Directory  for  storing  information  about  alerts  that  have   been   acknowledged.    Default:
              $XYMONVAR/acks/

       XYMONDISABLEDDIR
              Directory   for   storing   information   about   tests   that   have   been  disabled.   Default:
              $XYMONVAR/disabled/

       XYMONDATADIR
              Directory for storing incoming "data" messages.  Default: $XYMONVAR/data/

       XYMONRRDS
              Top-level directory for storing RRD files (the databases with trend-information used  to  generate
              graphs).  Default: $XYMONVAR/rrd/

       CLIENTLOGS
              Directory  for  storing  the  data  sent  by  a Xymon client around the time a status changes to a
              warning (yellow) or critical (red)  state.   Used  by  the  <u><a href="../man8/xymond_hostdata.8.html">xymond_hostdata</a>(8)</u>  module.   Default:
              $XYMONVAR/hostdata/

       XYMONCGILOGDIR
              Directory  where  debug  output from CGI applications are stored. If not specified, it defaults to
              $XYMONSERVERLOGS, but this is often a directory that is not writable by the userid running the CGI
              applications. It is therefore recommended when using "--debug" on CGI applications that you create
              a separate directory owned by the user running your webserver, and point  XYMONCGILOGDIR  to  this
              directory.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>URLS</b></h4><pre>
       XYMONSERVERWWWURL
              The  root  URL  for  the  Xymon  webpages,  without  the  hostname. This URL must be mapped to the
              <a href="file:~/server/www/">~/server/www/</a> directory in your webserver configuration. See the sample  Apache  configuration  in
              <a href="file:~/server/etc/xymon-apache.conf.">~/server/etc/xymon-apache.conf.</a>

       XYMONSERVERCGIURL
              The root URL for the Xymon CGI-scripts, without the hostname. This directory must be mapped to the
              <a href="file:~/cgi-bin/">~/cgi-bin/</a>  directory  in  your webserver configuration, and must be flagged as holding executable
              scripts. See the sample Apache configuration in <a href="file:~/server/etc/xymon-apache.conf.">~/server/etc/xymon-apache.conf.</a>

       XYMONWEBHOST
              Initial  part  of  the  Xymon  URL,  including  just  the  protocol   and   the   hostname,   e.g.
              "<a href="http://www.foo.com">http://www.foo.com</a>"

       XYMONWEBHOSTURL
              Prefix for all of the static Xymon webpages, e.g. "<a href="http://www.foo.com/xymon">http://www.foo.com/xymon</a>"

       XYMONWEBHTMLLOGS
              URL  prefix  for the static HTML status-logs generated when XYMONLOGSTATUS=STATIC.  Note that this
              setting is <b>discouraged</b> so this setting should not be used.

       XYMONWEB
              URL prefix (without hostname) of the Xymon webpages. E.g. "/xymon".

       XYMONSKIN
              URL prefix (without hostname) of the Xymon graphics. E.g. "/xymon/gifs".

       CGIBINURL
              URL prefix (without hostname) of the Xymon CGI-scripts. Default: $XYMONSERVERCGIURL .

       COLUMNDOCURL
              Format string used to  build  a  link  to  the  documentation  for  a  column  heading.   Default:
              "$CGIBINURL/columndoc.sh?%s",  which  causes links to use the <u><a href="../man1/columndoc.sh.1.html">columndoc.sh</a>(1)</u> script to document a
              column.

       HOSTDOCURL
              Format string used to build a link to the documentation for a host.  If not set, then Xymon  falls
              back  to  scanning  the  XYMONNOTES  directory  for  files  matching the hostname, or the hostname
              together with a common filename extension (.php, .html, .doc and  so  on).  If  set,  this  string
              becomes  a  formatting  string for the documentation URL. E.g. for the host "myhost", a setting of
              HOSTDOCURL="/docs/%s.php" will generate a link to "/docs/myhost.php".  Default: Not set,  so  host
              documentation will be retrieved from the XYMONNOTES directory.

</pre><h4><b>SETTINGS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>SENDING</b> <b>MESSAGES</b> <b>TO</b> <b>XYMON</b></h4><pre>
       XYMSRV The  IP-address  used to contact the <u><a href="../man8/xymond.8.html">xymond</a>(8)</u> service. Used by clients and the tools that perform
              network tests.  Default: $XYMONSERVERIP

       XYMSERVERS
              List of IP-addresses. Clients and network test tools will try to send status reports  to  a  Xymon
              server running on each of these addresses. This setting is only used if XYMSRV=0.0.0.0.

       XYMONDPORT
              The  portnumber  for  used  to  contact  the <u><a href="../man8/xymond.8.html">xymond</a>(8)</u> service. Used by clients and the tools that
              perform network tests.  Default: 1984.

       MAXMSGSPERCOMBO
              The maximum number of status messages to combine into one combo message.  Default: 100.

       SLEEPBETWEENMSGS
              Length of a pause introduced between each successive transmission of a combo-message by  xymonnet,
              in microseconds. Default: 0 (send messages as quickly as possible).

</pre><h4><b>XYMOND</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       ALERTCOLORS
              Comma-separated   list  of  the  colors  that  may  trigger  an  alert-message.   The  default  is
              "red,yellow,purple". Note that alerts  may  further  be  generated  or  suppressed  based  on  the
              configuration in the <u><a href="../man5/alerts.cfg.5.html">alerts.cfg</a>(5)</u> file.

       OKCOLORS
              Comma-separated  list  of  the  colors  that  may  trigger  a  recovery-message.   The  default is
              "green,clear,blue".

       ALERTREPEAT
              How often alerts get repeated while a status is in an alert state.  This is the  default  setting,
              which may be changed in the <u><a href="../man5/alerts.cfg.5.html">alerts.cfg</a>(5)</u> file.

       MAXMSG_STATUS
              The maximum size of a "status" message in kB, default: 256.  Status messages are the ones that end
              up  as  columns  on  the  web display. The default size should be adequate in most cases, but some
              extension scripts can generate very large status messages - close to  1024  kB.  You  should  only
              change this if you see messages in the xymond log file about status messages being truncated.

       MAXMSG_CLIENT
              The  maximum  size  of a "client" message in kB, default: 512.  "client" messages are generated by
              the Xymon client, and often include large process-listings. You should only change this if you see
              messages in the xymond log file about client messages being truncated.

       MAXMSG_DATA
              The maximum size of a "data" message in kB, default: 256.  "data" messages are typically used  for
              client  reports  of  e.g.  netstat  or vmstat data. You should only change this setting if you see
              messages in the xymond log file about data messages being truncated.

       MAXMSG_NOTES
              The maximum size of a "notes" message in kB, default: 256.  "notes" messages  provide  a  way  for
              uploading documentation about a host to Xymon; it is not enabled by default. If you want to upload
              large documents, you may need to change this setting.

       MAXMSG_STACHG
              The  maximum  size of a "status change" message in kB, default: Current value of the MAXMSG_STATUS
              setting.  Status-change messages occur when a status changes color. There is no reason  to  change
              this setting.

       MAXMSG_PAGE
              The  maximum  size of a "page" message in kB, default: Current value of the MAXMSG_STATUS setting.
              "page" messages are alerts, and include the status message that triggers the alert.  There  is  no
              reason to change this setting.

       MAXMSG_ENADIS
              The maximum size of an "enadis" message in kB, default: 32.  "enadis" are small messages used when
              enabling or disabling hosts and tests, so the default size should be adequate.

       MAXMSG_CLICHG
              The  maximum  size of a "client change" message in kB, default: Current value of the MAXMSG_CLIENT
              setting.  Client-change messages occur when a status changes color to  one  of  the  alert-colors,
              usually red, yellow and purple. There is no reason to change this setting.

       MAXMSG_USER
              The  maximum  size of a "user" message in kB, default: 128.  "user" messages are for communication
              between custom Xymon modules you have installed, it is not used directly by Xymon.

</pre><h4><b>XYMOND_HISTORY</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       XYMONALLHISTLOG
              If set to TRUE, <u><a href="../man8/xymond_history.8.html">xymond_history</a>(8)</u> will update the $XYMONHISTDIR/allevents file logging all changes
              to a status. The allevents file is used by the <u><a href="../man1/eventlog.cgi.1.html">eventlog.cgi</a>(1)</u> tool to show  the  list  of  recent
              events on the "All non-green" webpage.

       XYMONHOSTHISTLOG
              If  set to TRUE, <u><a href="../man8/xymond_history.8.html">xymond_history</a>(8)</u> will update the host-specific eventlog that keeps record of all
              status changes for a host. This logfile is not used by any Xymon tool.

       SAVESTATUSLOG
              If set to TRUE, <u><a href="../man8/xymond_history.8.html">xymond_history</a>(8)</u> will save historical detailed status-logs to the  $XYMONHISTLOGS
              directory.

</pre><h4><b>XYMOND_ALERT</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       MAIL   Command  used to send alerts via e-mail, including a "Subject:" header in the mail. Default: "mail
              -s"

       MAILC  Command used to send alerts via e-mail in a form that does not  have  a  "Subject"  in  the  mail.
              Default: "mail"

       SVCCODES
              Maps  status-columns  to  numeric  service-codes. The numeric codes are used when sending an alert
              using a script, where the numeric code of the service is provided in the BBSVCNUM variable.

</pre><h4><b>XYMOND_RRD</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       TEST2RRD
              List of "COLUMNNAME[=RRDSERVICE]" settings, that define which status-  and  data-messages  have  a
              corresponding RRD graph. You will normally not need to modify this, unless you have added a custom
              TCP-based  test to the protocols.cfg file, and want to collect data about the response-time, OR if
              you are using the <u><a href="../man8/xymond_rrd.8.html">xymond_rrd</a>(8)</u> external script mechanism  to  collect  data  from  custom  tests.
              Note: All TCP tests are automatically added.

       GRAPHS_&lt;COLUMNAME&gt;
              List  of GRAPHs that should be displayed on the corresponding column page. Note this will override
              the  default,  so  to  add  multiple  graphs  you  should   include   the   original   one   (e.g.
              GRAPHS_cpu="la,vmstat1").

              These are used together by the <u><a href="../man1/svcstatus.cgi.1.html">svcstatus.cgi</a>(1)</u> script to determine if the detailed status view of
              a test should include a graph.

       GRAPHS List of the RRD databases, that should be shown as a graph on the "trends" column.

       NORRDDISKS
              This  is  used to disable the tracking of certain filesystems. By default all filesystems reported
              by a client are tracked. In some cases you may want to disable this for certain filesystems,  e.g.
              database  filesystems  since they are always completely full. This setting is a regular expression
              that is matched against the filesystem name (the Unix mount-point, or the Windows  disk-letter)  -
              if the filesystem name matches this expression, then it will not be tracked by Xymon.
              Note: Setting this does not affect filesystems that are already being tracked by Xymon - to remove
              them,    you   must   remove   the   RRD   files   for   the   unwanted   filesystems   from   the
              ~xymon/data/rrd/HOSTNAME/ directory.

       RRDDISKS
              This is used to enable tracking of only selected filesystems (see the NORRDDISKS  setting  above).
              By default all filesystems are being tracked, setting this changes that default so that only those
              filesystems that match this pattern will be tracked.

</pre><h4><b>XYMONNET</b> <b>NETWORK</b> <b>TEST</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       XYMONNETWORK
              If  this  variable  is defined, then only the hosts that have been tagged with "NET:$XYMONNETWORK"
              will be tested by the xymonnet tool.

       CONNTEST
              If set to TRUE, the connectivity (ping) test will be performed.

       IPTEST_2_CLEAR_ON_FAILED_CONN
              If set to TRUE, then failing network tests go CLEAR if the conn-test fails.

       NONETPAGE
              List of network services (separated with &lt;space&gt;) that should go yellow upon  failure  instead  of
              red.

       XYMONROUTERTEXT
              When  using  the "router" or "depends" tags for a host, a failure status will include text that an
              "Intermediate router is down".  With todays network topologies, the router could be  a  switch  or
              another network device; if you define this environment variable the word "router" will be replaced
              with  whatever  you  put  into the variable. So to inform the users that an intermediate switch or
              router is down, use XYMONROUTERTEXT="switch or router".  This can also be set on a per-host  basis
              using the "DESCR:hosttype:description" tag in the <u><a href="../man5/hosts.cfg.5.html">hosts.cfg</a>(5)</u> file.

       NETFAILTEXT
              When  a  network test fails, the status message reports "SERVICENAME not OK". The "not OK" message
              can be changed via this variable, e.g.  you can change it to "FAILED" or customize it as you like.

       FPING  The command used to run the <u><a href="../man1/xymonping.1.html">xymonping</a>(1)</u> tool for the connectivity test. (The name FPING is due to
              the fact that the "fping" utility was used until Xymon version 4.2). This  may  include  suid-root
              wrappers and xymonping options.  Default: "xymonping"

       FPINGOPTS
              Options  used  for the <u><a href="../man1/fping.1.html">fping</a>(1)</u> or <u><a href="../man1/xymonping.1.html">xymonping</a>(1)</u> tool for the connectivity test. Note that xymonnet
              will still expect the output to match the default format.  Default: "-Ae"

       TRACEROUTE

       TRACEROUTEOPTS
              Defines the location of the "traceroute" tool and any options needed to run it. traceroute is used
              by the connectivity test when the  ping  test  fails;  if  requested  via  the  "trace"  tag,  the
              TRACEROUTE  command  is  executed  to try to indicate the point in the network that is causing the
              problem. For backwards compatibility, with prior versions, if TRACEROUTEOPTS is unset,  TRACEROUTE
              is  assumed  to  have  whatever  options  are  desired  and no addl options are used.  Recommended
              defaults are:  "-n -q 2 -w 2 -m 15" (no DNS lookup, max. 2 probes, wait 2 seconds per hop, max  15
              hops).

              If  you  have the <u><a href="../man8/mtr.8.html">mtr</a>(8)</u> tool installed - available from <a href="http://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/">http://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/</a> - I strongly
              recommend using this instead. The recommended TRACEROUTEOPTS for mtr are "-c 2 -n  --report"  Note
              that mtr needs to be installed suid-root on most systems.

       NTPDATE
              Defines the <u><a href="../man1/ntpdate.1.html">ntpdate</a>(1)</u> program used for the "ntp" test.  Default: "ntpdate"

       NTPDATEOPTS
              Options used for the <u><a href="../man1/ntpdate.1.html">ntpdate</a>(1)</u> program.  Default: "-u -q -p 1"

       RPCINFO
              Defines the <u><a href="../man8/rpcinfo.8.html">rpcinfo</a>(8)</u> program used for "rpc" tests.  Default: "rpcinfo"

</pre><h4><b>XYMONGEN</b> <b>WEBPAGE</b> <b>GENERATOR</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       XYMONLOGO
              HTML  code that is inserted on all standard headers. The default is to add the text "Xymon" in the
              upper-left corner of the page, but you can easily replace this with e.g. a company  logo.  If  you
              do, I suggest that you keep it at about 30-35 pixels high, and 100-150 pixels wide.

       XYMONPAGELOCAL
              The  string  "Pages hosted locally" that appears above all of the pages linked from the main Xymon
              webpage.

       XYMONPAGESUBLOCAL
              The string "Subpages hosted locally" that appears above all of the  sub-pages  linked  from  pages
              below the main Xymon webpage.

       XYMONPAGEREMOTE
              The  string  "Remote  status display" that appears about the summary statuses displayed on the min
              Xymon webpage.

       XYMONPAGETITLE
              HTML tags designed to go in a &lt;FONT&gt; tag, to choose the font for titles of the webpages.

       XYMONPAGEROWFONT
              HTML tags designed to go in a &lt;FONT&gt; tag, to choose the font for row headings (hostnames)  on  the
              webpages.

       XYMONPAGECOLFONT
              HTML  tags  designed  to go in a &lt;FONT&gt; tag, to chose the font for column headings (test names) on
              the webpages.

       XYMONPAGEACKFONT
              HTML tags designed to go in a &lt;FONT&gt; tag, to chose the font for the acknowledgement text displayed
              on the status-log HTML page for an acknowledged status.

       ACKUNTILMSG
              When displaying the detailed status of an acknowledged test, Xymon will include the time that  the
              acknowledge  expires using the print-format defined in this setting. You can define the timeformat
              using the controls in your systems <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3)</u> routine, and add the text suitable for your setup.

       ACK_COOKIE_EXPIRATION
              The valid length of an acknowledgement cookie. You want to set this large enough so that  a  late-
              answered acknowledgement for an alert is still processed properly.  Default value: 86400

       XYMONDATEFORMAT
              On webpages generated by xymongen, the default header includes the current date and time. Normally
              this  looks  like  "Tue  Aug  24  21:59:47  2004". The XYMONDATEFORMAT controls the format of this
              timestamp - you can define the format using the controls in the <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3)</u> routine. E.g. to  have
              it show up as "2004-08-24 21:59:47 +0200" you would set XYMONDATEFORMAT="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z"

       HOLIDAYFORMAT
              How  holiday  dates  are  displayed. The default is "%d/%m" which show the day and month. American
              users may want to change this to "%m/%d" to suit their preferred date-display  style.  This  is  a
              formatting  string  for the system <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3)</u> routine, so any controls available for this routine
              may be used.

       XYMONPAGECOLREPEAT
              Inspired by Jeff Stoner's col_repeat_patch.tgz patch, this defines  the  maximum  number  of  rows
              before repeating the column headings on a webpage. This sets the default value for the <u><a href="../man1/xymongen.1.html">xymongen</a>(1)</u>
              "--maxrows"  option;  if  the  command-line  option  is  also  specified,  then  it overrides this
              environment variable. Note that unlike Jeff's patch, xymongen implements this for  both  the  "All
              non-green" page and all other pages (xymon.html, subpages, critical.html).

       SUMMARY_SET_BKG
              If set to TRUE, then summaries will affect the color of the main Xymon webpage. Default: FALSE.

       DOTHEIGHT
              The height (in pixels) of the icons showing the color of a status.  Default: 16, which matches the
              default icons.

       DOTWIDTH
              The  width (in pixels) of the icons showing the color of a status.  Default: 16, which matches the
              default icons.

       CLIENTSVCS
              List of the status logs fed by data from the Xymon client. These status logs will - if  there  are
              Xymon  client  data  available  for  the host - include a link to the raw data sent by the client.
              Default: cpu,disk,memory,procs,svcs.

       XYMONRSSTITLE
              If defined, this is the title of the RSS/RDF documents generated when <u><a href="../man1/xymongen.1.html">xymongen</a>(1)</u> is invoked  with
              the "--rss" option. The default value is "Xymon Alerts".

       WMLMAXCHARS
              Maximum size of a WAP/WML output "card" when generating these.  Default: 1500.

       XYMONNONGREENEXT
              List  of  scripts  to  run  as  extensions  to  the  "All  non-green" page. Note that two scripts,
              "eventlog.sh" and "acklog.sh" are handled specially: They are handled internally by xymongen,  but
              the script names must be listed in this variable for this function to be enabled.

       XYMONHISTEXT
              List of scripts to run as extensions to a history page.

       XYMONREPWARN
              Default   threshold  for  listing  the  availability  as  "critical"  (red)  when  generating  the
              availability report. This can be set on a per-host basis with the WARNPCT setting in <u><a href="../man5/hosts.cfg.5.html">hosts.cfg</a>(5).</u>
              Default: 97 (percent)

       XYMONGENREPOPTS
              Default  xymongen  options  used  for  reports.  This  will  typically  include  such  options  as
              "--subpagecolumns",  and  also "--ignorecolumns" if you wish to exclude certain tests from reports
              by default.

       XYMONGENSNAPOPTS
              Default xymongen options used by snapshots. This should be identical to the options  you  normally
              used when building Xymon webpages.
