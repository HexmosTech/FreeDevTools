       load_parameters - Grid Engine default load parameters

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The load parameters reported by the execution daemon <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) by default currently are:

       <b>arch</b>   An  architecture  string  compiled into the sge_execd describing the operating system architecture
              for which the execd is targeted.  Possible values include:
                   aix51          for IBM AIX 5.1, 5.3
                   darwin-x86     for Apple Mac OS/X x86
                   darwin-ppc     for Apple Mac OS/X PowerPC
                   hp11      for HP HP-UX 11.x 32-bit
                   hp11-64        for HP HP-UX 11.x 64-bit
                   lx-amd64  for GNU/Linux x86_64
                   lx-x86         for GNU/Linux x86
                   sol-sparc64    for Sun Solaris Sparc64
                   sol-x86        for Sun Solaris x86
                   sol-amd64 for Sun Solaris x86_64
                   win32-x86 for Windows x86
              Note that an sge_execd for a particular architecture may run on multiple  OS  versions.   In  this
              case, the architecture string delivered by the execution daemon may be misleading.

       <b>num_proc</b>
              The number of processors provided by the execution host.  The host is defined by a single Internet
              address,  i.e. rack mounted multi host systems are counted as a cluster rather than a single multi
              headed machine.  In the case of "hardware threads" ("CMT" or  "SMT"),  normally  num_proc  is  the
              number of such threads which are activated.

       The  following load information is only available under IBM AIX if Grid Engine is built with the perfstat
       library (which is now the default):

       <b>load_short</b>
              The short time average OS run queue length. It is the  first  of  the  value  triple  reported  by
              <u><a href="../man1/uptime.1.html">uptime</a></u>(1).  Many implementations provide a 1 minute average with this value.

       <b>load_medium</b>
              The  medium  time  average  OS  run queue length. It is the second of the value triple reported by
              <u><a href="../man1/uptime.1.html">uptime</a></u>(1).  Many implementations provide a 5 minute average with this value.

       <b>load_long</b>
              The long time average OS run queue length. It is  the  third  of  the  value  triple  reported  by
              <u><a href="../man1/uptime.1.html">uptime</a></u>(1).  Many implementations provide a 10 or 15 minute average with this value.

       <b>load_avg</b>
              The same as load_medium.

       <b>np_load_short</b>
              The  same  as  load_short but divided by the number of processors. This value allows comparing the
              load of single and multi-headed hosts.

       <b>np_load_medium</b>
              The same as load_medium but divided by the number of processors. This value allows  comparing  the
              load of single and multi-headed hosts.

       <b>np_load_long</b>
              The  same  as  load_long  but divided by the number of processors. This value allows comparing the
              load of single and multi-headed hosts.

       <b>np_load_avg</b>
              The same as load_avg but divided by the number of processors. This value allows comparing the load
              of single and multi-headed hosts.

       <b>cpu</b>    The percentage of CPU time not in idle state.

       The following load information is only available under IBM AIX if Grid Engine is built with the  perfstat
       library (which is now the default):

       <b>mem_free</b>
              The amount of free real memory.

       <b>swap_free</b>
              The amount of free swap memory.

       <b>virtual_free</b>
              The sum of mem_free and swap_free.

       <b>mem_used</b>
              The amount of memory used.

       <b>swap_used</b>
              The amount of swap space used.

       <b>virtual_used</b>
              The sum of mem_used and swap_used.

       <b>mem_total</b>
              The total amount of memory (free+used).

       <b>swap_total</b>
              The total amount of swap space (free+used).

       <b>virtual_total</b>
              The sum of mem_total and swap_total.

       The following load information is ONLY available under Windows:

       <b>display_win_gui</b>
              The host is capable of displaying the GUI of a Windows job.

       The  following  load  information  is only available if Grid Engine was built with the hwloc library (the
       default) and if hwloc supports the system.

       <b>m_topology_inuse</b>
              The host cpu topology string reported by an execution host.  This might be "NONE" if the  topology
              cannot  be determined; otherwise it is a string consisting of the upper and lowercase letters "S",
              "C", "T", "c", and "t". The sequence  of  letters  within  that  string  represents  the  hardware
              topology where "S" represents a socket, "C" or "c" a core, and "T" or "t" a hardware thread.

              The  string  "SCCSCCSCCSCC" will returned by a host that has 4 sockets where each of those sockets
              has two cores.  All cores are available because all "C"s appear in capital letters.

              If lowercase letters are used then this means that the corresponding core or thread is already  in
              use because there is at least one running Grid Engine job bound to it.

              "SCCSCcSCCscc" means that core 2 on socket 2 and also core 1 and core 2 on socket 4 are in use.

       <b>m_topology</b>
              Like  m_topology_inuse,  except  that  it  represents the architecture, not the use of it, i.e. it
              doesn't contain lower case letters.

       <b>m_socket</b>
              Number of sockets available on the reporting host (e.g. "SCCSCCSCCSCC" =&gt; m_socket=4)

       <b>m_core</b> Number of cores reported for all sockets on a host (e.g. "SCCSCCSCCSCC" =&gt; m_core=2)

       <b>m_thread</b>
              Number of hardware threads reported for all cores on a host, which should  be  equal  to  num_proc
              (e.g. "SCTTCTTCTTCTT" =&gt; m_thread=8)

   <b>Static</b> <b>Load</b> <b>Values</b>
       The  "static"  load  values  (which  may  be  selected with <b>qhost</b> <b>-l</b> or <b>qselect</b> <b>-l</b>) are:  arch, num_proc,
       mem_total, swap_total, virtual_total, m_topology, m_socket, m_core, m_thread.
