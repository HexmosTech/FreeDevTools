</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       srec_trs80 - Radio Shack TRS‐80 object file format specification

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This   document   describes  the  binary  object  file  format  for  the  Z80‐based  Radio  Shack  TRS‐80
       microcomputers, such as the Model I, II, III, 4, 4D, and 4P.  The binary format is generated by the disk‐
       based Assembler/Editor, and used for TRS‐DOS program files.

       The object file is blocked into records, each of which contains the  record  type,  length,  and  payload
       data.   For  Data  and End of File records, the payload starts with two bytes of address in little‐endian
       format.  There are four main types of records that are defined.  The record types are:

       • Data Record

       • End of File Record with Execution Transfer

       • End of File Record without Execution Transfer

       • Comment

       • Start Linear Address Record (32‐bit format only)

   <b>General</b> <b>Record</b> <b>Format</b>
       ┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
       │ Record  │ Record  │ Load    │ Data    │
       │ Type    │ Length  │ Address │         │
       └─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘

       Record Type.
               Each record begins with a single byte Record Type field which specifies the record type  of  this
               record.   The Record Type field is used to interpret the remaining information within the record.
               This field is one byte, represented as two hexadecimal characters.   The  encoding  for  all  the
               current record types are:

               1  Data Record

               2  End of File Record with Execution Transfer

               3  End of File Record without Execution Transfer

               5  Comment Record

       Record Length
               Each  record  has  a  single  byte  Record  Length  field  which specifies the number of bytes of
               information or data which follows the Record Length field of the record.  The  maximum  value  of
               the  Record  Length  field  is hexadecimal “FF” or 255.  In the case of Data Records only, Record
               Length byte values of zero to two are considered to be lengths of 256 to 258, respectively.

       Address Data and End records have a two‐byte  Address  field  in  little‐endian  byte  order.   For  Data
               records,  this  is the starting address at which to load the remaining payload of the record.  In
               End records, this is the address for the  start  of  execution  of  the  file,  or  zero  if  not
               applicable.

       Data    Each  record  has  a  variable  length  Data  field,  it  consists  of  zero  or more bytes.  The
               interpretation of this field depends on the Record Type field.
