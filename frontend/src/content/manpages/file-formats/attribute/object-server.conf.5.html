</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>object-server.conf</b> - configuration file for the OpenStack Swift object server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>object-server.conf</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  the configuration file used by the object server and other object background services, such as;
       replicator, reconstructor, updater, auditor, and expirer.

       The configuration file follows the python-pastedeploy syntax. The file is divided  into  sections,  which
       are enclosed by square brackets. Each section will contain a certain number of key/value parameters which
       are described later.

       Any line that begins with a '#' symbol is ignored.

       You    can    find    more    information    about    python-pastedeploy    configuration    format    at
       <u>https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pastedeploy/en/latest/#config-format</u>

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>

       section.

       <b>bind_ip</b>
              IP address the object server should bind to. The default is 0.0.0.0 which will make it bind to all
              available addresses.

       <b>bind_port</b>
              TCP port the object server should bind to. The default is 6200.

       <b>keep_idle</b>
              Value to set for socket TCP_KEEPIDLE. The default value is 600.

       <b>bind_timeout</b>
              Timeout to bind socket. The default is 30.

       <b>workers</b>
              The number of pre-forked processes that will accept connections.  Zero means no fork.  The default
              is  auto  which  will  make  the  server  try to match the number of effective cpu cores if python
              multiprocessing is available (included with most python distributions &gt;= 2.6) or fallback to  one.
              It's  worth  noting that individual workers will use many eventlet co-routines to service multiple
              concurrent requests.

       <b>max_clients</b>
              Maximum number of clients one worker can process simultaneously (it will actually  <a href="../man2/accept.2.html">accept</a>(2)  N  +

              from  0  to  7.  The  higher  the value, the lower the I/O priority of the process. Work only with
              ionice_class.  Ignored if IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE is set.

</pre><h4><b>PIPELINE</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is indicated by section name [pipeline:main]. Below are the parameters that  are  acceptable  within
       this section.

       <b>pipeline</b>
              It  is  used  when  you  need  to  apply  a number of filters. It is a list of filters ended by an
              application. The normal pipeline is "healthcheck recon object-server".

</pre><h4><b>APP</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is indicated by section name [app:object-server]. Below  are  the  parameters  that  are  acceptable
       within this section.

       <b>use</b>    Entry  point for paste.deploy for the object server. This is the reference to the installed python
              egg.  This is normally <b>egg:swift#object</b>.

       <b>set</b> <b>log_name</b>
              Label used when logging. The default is object-server.

       <b>set</b> <b>log_facility</b>
              Syslog log facility. The default is LOG_LOCAL0.

       <b>set</b> <b>log_level</b>
              Logging level. The default is INFO.

       <b>set</b> <b>log_requests</b>
              Enables request logging. The default is True.

       <b>set</b> <b>log_address</b>
              Logging address. The default is /dev/log.

       <b>max_upload_time</b>
              The default is 86400.

       <b>slow</b>   The default is 0.

       <b>keep_cache_size</b>
              Objects smaller than this are not evicted from the buffercache once read. The default is 5242880.

       <b>keep_cache_private</b>
              If true, objects for authenticated GET requests may be kept in buffer cache if small  enough.  The
              default is false.

       <b>mb_per_sync</b>
              On PUTs, sync data every n MB. The default is 512.

       <b>allowed_headers</b>
              Comma  separated  list  of  headers  that  can  be  set in metadata on an object.  This list is in
              addition to X-Object-Meta-* headers and cannot  include  Content-Type,  etag,  Content-Length,  or
              deleted.   The  default is 'Content-Disposition, Content-Encoding, X-Delete-At, X-Object-Manifest,
              X-Static-Large-Object, Cache-Control, Content-Language, Expires, X-Robots-Tag'.

       <b>replication_server</b>
              Configure parameter for creating specific server To handle all verbs, including replication verbs,
              do not specify "replication_server" (this is the default). To only handle replication,  set  to  a
              True  value (e.g. "True" or "1"). To handle only non-replication verbs, set to "False". Unless you
              have a separate replication network, you should not specify any value for "replication_server".

       <b>replication_concurrency</b>
              Set to restrict the number of concurrent incoming SSYNC requests  Set  to  0  for  unlimited  (the
              default  is  4).  Note that SSYNC requests are only used by the object reconstructor or the object
              replicator when configured to use ssync.

       <b>replication_concurrency_per_device</b>
              Set to restrict the number of concurrent  incoming  SSYNC  requests  per  device;  set  to  0  for
              unlimited  requests  per devices. This can help control I/O to each device. This does not override
              replication_concurrency described above, so you may need to adjust both  parameters  depending  on
              your hardware or network capacity. Defaults to 1.

       <b>replication_lock_timeout</b>
              Number of seconds to wait for an existing replication device lock before giving up. The default is
              15.

       <b>replication_failure_threshold</b>

       <b>replication_failure_ratio</b>
              These two settings control when the SSYNC subrequest handler will abort an incoming SSYNC attempt.
              An abort will occur if there are at least threshold number of failures and the value of failures /
              successes  exceeds the ratio. The defaults of 100 and 1.0 means that at least 100 failures have to
              occur and there have to be more failures than successes for an abort to occur.

       <b>splice</b> Use splice() for zero-copy object GETs. This requires Linux kernel version 3.0 or greater. If  you
              set  "splice  =  yes" but the kernel does not support it, error messages will appear in the object
              server logs at startup, but your object servers should  continue  to  function.   The  default  is
              false.

       <b>node_timeout</b>
              Request timeout to external services. The default is 3 seconds.

       <b>conn_timeout</b>
              Connection timeout to external services. The default is 0.5 seconds.

       <b>container_update_timeout</b>
              Time to wait while sending a container update on object update. The default is 1 second.

       <b>nice_priority</b>
              Modify  scheduling priority of server processes. Niceness values range from -20 (most favorable to
              the process) to 19 (least favorable to the process).  The default does not modify priority.

       <b>ionice_class</b>
              Modify I/O scheduling class of server processes. I/O niceness  class  values  are  IOPRIO_CLASS_RT
              (realtime),  IOPRIO_CLASS_BE  (best-effort)  and  IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE  (idle).  The default does not
              modify class and priority.  Work only with ionice_priority.

       <b>ionice_priority</b>
              Modify I/O scheduling priority of server processes. I/O niceness priority is a number  which  goes
              from  0  to  7.  The  higher  the value, the lower the I/O priority of the process. Work only with
              ionice_class.  Ignored if IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE is set.

</pre><h4><b>FILTER</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       Any section that has its name prefixed by "filter:" indicates a filter  section.   Filters  are  used  to
       specify  configuration  parameters  for  specific swift middlewares.  Below are the filters available and
       respective acceptable parameters.

       <b>[filter:healthcheck]</b>

          <b>use</b>    Entry point for paste.deploy for the healthcheck middleware.  This  is  the  reference  to  the
                 installed python egg.  This is normally <b>egg:swift#healthcheck</b>.

          <b>disable_path</b>
                 An  optional  filesystem  path which, if present, will cause the healthcheck URL to return "503
                 Service Unavailable" with a body of "DISABLED BY FILE".

       <b>[filter:recon]</b>

          <b>use</b>    Entry point for paste.deploy for the recon middleware. This is the reference to  the  installed
                 python egg.  This is normally <b>egg:swift#recon</b>.

          <b>recon_cache_path</b>
                 The  recon_cache_path  simply  sets  the  directory where stats for a few items will be stored.
                 Depending on the method of deployment you may need to create this directory manually and ensure
                 that swift has read/write. The default is /var/cache/swift.

          <b>recon_lock_path</b>
                 The default is /var/lock.

       <b>[filter:xprofile]</b>

          <b>use</b>    Entry point for paste.deploy for  the  xprofile  middleware.  This  is  the  reference  to  the
                 installed python egg.  This is normally <b>egg:swift#xprofile</b>.

          <b>profile_module</b>
                 This  option enable you to switch profilers which should inherit from python standard profiler.
                 Currently the supported value can be 'cProfile', 'eventlet.green.profile' etc.

          <b>log_filename_prefix</b>
                 This prefix will be used to combine process ID and timestamp to name  the  profile  data  file.
                 Make sure the executing user has permission to write into this path (missing path segments will
                 be  created,  if necessary).  If you enable profiling in more than one type of daemon, you must
                 override it with an unique value like, the default is /var/log/swift/profile/account.profile.

          <b>dump_interval</b>
                 The profile data will be dumped to local disk based on above naming rule in this interval.  The
                 default is 5.0.

          <b>dump_timestamp</b>
                 Be  careful,  this option will enable profiler to dump data into the file with time stamp which
                 means there will be lots of files piled up in the directory.  The default is false

          <b>path</b>   This is the path of the URL to access the mini web UI. The default is __profile__.

          <b>flush_at_shutdown</b>
                 Clear the data when the wsgi server shutdown. The default is false.

          <b>unwind</b> Unwind the iterator of applications. Default is false.

</pre><h4><b>ADDITIONAL</b> <b>SECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following sections are used by other swift-object services, such as replicator, updater, auditor.

       <b>[object-replicator]</b>

          <b>sync_method</b>
                 The sync method to use; default is rsync but you can use ssync to  try  the  EXPERIMENTAL  all-
                 swift-code-no-rsync-callouts  method.  Once  ssync is verified as having performance comparable
                 to, or better than, rsync, we plan to deprecate rsync so we can move on with more features  for
                 replication.

          <b>rsync_compress</b>
                 Allow  rsync  to  compress  data which is transmitted to destination node during sync. However,
                 this is applicable only when destination node is in a different  region  than  the  local  one.
                 NOTE:  Objects  that  are  already  compressed (for example: .tar.gz, .mp3) might slow down the
                 syncing process. The default is false.

          <b>rsync_module</b>
                 Format of the rsync module where the replicator will send data. See etc/rsyncd.conf-sample  for

          <b>rsync_error_log_line_length</b>
                 Limits how long rsync error log lines are. 0 (default) means to log the entire line.

          <b>recon_cache_path</b>
                 The recon_cache_path simply sets the directory where stats for a  few  items  will  be  stored.
                 Depending on the method of deployment you may need to create this directory manually and ensure
                 that swift has read/write.The default is /var/cache/swift.

          <b>handoffs_first</b>
                 The  flag  to replicate handoffs prior to canonical partitions.  It allows one to force syncing
                 and deleting handoffs quickly.  If set to a True value(e.g. "True" or "1"), partitions that are
                 not supposed to be on the node will be replicated first.  The default is false.

          <b>handoff_delete</b>
                 The number of replicas which are ensured in swift.  If the  number  less  than  the  number  of
                 replicas  is  set,  object-replicator  could delete local handoffs even if all replicas are not
                 ensured in the cluster. Object-replicator would  remove  local  handoff  partition  directories
                 after  syncing  partition  when  the number of successful responses is greater than or equal to
                 this number. By default(auto), handoff partitions will be removed   when  it  has  successfully
                 replicated to all the canonical nodes.

                 The  handoffs_first  and handoff_delete are options for a special case such as disk full in the
                 cluster. These two options SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED, except for such an extreme situations.  (e.g.
                 disks filled up or are about to fill up. Anyway, DO NOT let your drives fill up).
