       lowdown — Markdown reference for lowdown

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Markdown is a simple, plain-text formatting language.  “Plain-text” in this case means the document input
       looks  similar to the output, less the formatting niceties (boxed tables, italics, clickable links, etc.)
       provided by the output medium.  For example:

             # How to be a Picard fan

             ## Introduction

             In order to develop fandom skills one must first and foremost
             know *whom* one idolises. Therefore: **who is Captain Picard**?

             1. Picard was named the \*Best Star Trek Captain\*, according
             to a [5-week poll](poll.html).

                 &gt; Picard continued his winning ways in the final week,
                 &gt; with fans naming him the most inspiring captain.

             2. Picard is handsome. ![Picard](image.jpg)
             3. Picard knows how to code: `make engage`

             ---------------------------------

             ## Picard Fandom

             Here's why everyone wants to be a fan...

       This example consists of a series of block elements: section header, sub-section header,  paragraph,  set
       of  list  elements, horizontal rule, then another sub-section header.  Each block element contains inline
       elements: normal text, emphasised text (bold and italised), an image, a link, and a span of code.

       This document describes the Markdown syntax accepted by <u><a href="../man1/lowdown.1.html">lowdown</a></u>(1).

</pre><h4><b>TEXT</b></h4><pre>
       Text within Markdown documents must be UTF-8.  The document may have the byte-order mark (BOM),  although
       this practice is discouraged by the Unicode standard.  Lines of text may be UNIX terminated (‘\n’) or DOS
       (‘\r\n’).  In the latter case, carriage returns are stripped from input if detected at the first line.

</pre><h4><b>BLOCK</b> <b>ELEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       A  block  element  starts  on  a  new  line and extends to the next blank line or block element.  A block
       element contains inline elements.

   <b>Paragraphs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Breaks</b>
       A paragraph is made up of one or more lines of text possibly containing inline elements.  Paragraphs  are
       separated by blank lines.

       To  insert  a  hard line break (i.e., a line-break in the input that is reproduced in the output), insert
       two spaces at the end of the line.  If commonmark input parsing is enabled, this may also be effected  by
       escaping the newline:

             Darmok and Jalad...\
             at Tanagra.

   <b>Headers</b>
       There  are two styles of headers: underlined (“setext”) and hash-marked (“atx”).  For underlined headers,
       underline the given word using equal signs (“=”) for first-level headers and  dashes  (“-”)  for  second-
       level headers.

             This is an underlined header 1
             ==============================

       For  hash-marked  headers,  use the corresponding number of hash characters to the corresponding level of
       header, up to 6 levels, at the start of the line separated by one space followed by the header.

             ## This is a hash-marked header 2

       If commonmark input parsing is enabled, the space is required after the  hash-marks  in  any  hash-marked
       header.

       Both  types support PHP Extra attributes enclosed in curly braces.  These may begin at any point and must
       end at the end of the line.

             ## Star Trek: Enterprise { #stent }

             Star Trek: Enterprise { .reboots }
             ---------------------

       Non-empty values with a leading period are interpreted as HTML (CSS) or OpenDocument classes, and  values
       with a leading pound symbol are interpreted as in-document link identifiers.

       Extra  attribute identifiers override the default mechanism for creating header identifiers.  They should
       contain only ASCII alphanumeric characters.

   <b>Block</b> <b>Quotes</b>
       Block quoted sections are invoked with a single right-angle bracket (“&gt;”) followed  by  a  space  at  the
       start of each line and between paragraphs.

             &gt; The Prime Directive is not just a set of rules;
             &gt; it is a philosophy... and a very correct one.
             &gt;
             &gt; (It goes on for a few paragraphs).

       Block  quotes  may  also have a non-multiline invocation: you need only invoke the right-angle bracket at
       the start of a paragraph and omit it entirely between paragraphs.

             &gt; You cannot explain away a wantonly immoral act because
             you think it is connected to some higher purpose.

             &gt; Here is another paragraph about Picard wisdom.

       Consecutive blockquotes as above will be merged as paragraphs within a single block quote on output, even
       if styles (non-multiline and otherwise) are mixed.

       Block quotes may be nested within other block quotes, as may any other block elements  such  as  headers,
       ordered/unordered lists, and code blocks.

             &gt; ### hash-marked header 3
             &gt;
             &gt; &gt; I'd be delighted to offer any advice
             &gt; &gt; I have on understanding women.
             &gt; &gt; When I have some, I'll let you know.
             &gt;
             &gt; 1.  advice list item 1
             &gt; 2.  advice list item 2
             &gt;
             &gt; Here's the code to implement JLP's advice:

             &gt;     yes | read engage

   <b>Admonitions</b>
       Also  called  "callouts",  these  special  block  quotes call attention to contents.  These are generally
       rendered as-is, but some output modes will specially render admonitions to highlight the content.

             &gt; **Note**
             &gt;
             &gt; The computer is voiced by Majel Barrett.

       Callouts begin with a double-emphasis "Note" or "Warning", and omitting the  initial  newline  suppresses
       white-space  after  the  callout  type.   This  is GFM syntax.  The MDN syntax includes an initial phrase
       following the callout type and colon, and also supports the "Callout" type:

             &gt; **Warning:** red alert.
             &gt;
             &gt; Romulan warbird decloaking!

   <b>Lists</b>
       Lists may be specified as ordered (numbered) or unordered.  Ordered lists are invoked as numbers followed
       by periods (e.g., “1.”) and rendered in a similar format.  <u>Note</u>: it does not matter which order or  which
       numbers you use in your ordered lists, as all ordered lists start at one.

             1. Make.
             2. It.
             1. So. (Not 1. again!)

       If  commonmark  input  parsing  is  enabled,  list  items  may  alternatively  terminate  with  the right
       parenthesis:

             1) Live long
             2) Prosper

       To prevent lists erroneously started by a paragraph beginning with a number and period, use  a  backslash
       before the period.

             1987. The year TNG premiered.

             1987\. The year TNG premiered.

       Unordered  lists, on the other hand, can be invoked using either asterisk (“*”), pluses (“+”), or hyphens
       (“-”), and can be a mix of all three styles.  Regardless the style, list items are rendered the same way.

             - Earl Grey tea.
             * Shakespeare.
             + Exotic fish.

       All nested block elements need a new line break, otherwise they will be rendered on the same line as  the
       list  item  on  output.   To  insert  paragraphs into a list item, indent each paragraph with either four
       spaces or one tab.

             - First list item

                 Courage can be an emotion too.

                 Things are only impossible until they're not.
             + Second list item
             + Third list item

       To insert block quotes into a list item, indent the block quote with four spaces or one tab prior to  the
       right-angle bracket (“&gt;”).

             * List item 1
             * List item 2

                  &gt; I am Locutus of Borg.

                  &gt; That is the cutest of Borg.

       Code  blocks  need  to  be  indented  twice (two tabs or eight leading spaces): once for being recognised
       within the list item, another for the code block itself.

             * Here is a list item for an indented code block:

                     alias path='echo -e ${PATH//:/\n}'

       To make list elements occur in tight sequence — like a grocery list — don't have an  empty  line  between
       the items.

             - Phaser
             - Communicator

       On the other hand, if you want to render lists separated by white-space, use the following syntax:

             - A phaser is a type of weapon.

             - A communicator keeps Riker in contact with Troi.

       This applies to ordered and unordered list types.

   <b>Task</b> <b>lists</b>
       One  form  of  an unordered list is task lists, a GFM extension.  These begin with checkboxes (checked or
       not), rendered similarly in the output.

             Star Trek series with episodes in the Delta quadrant:

             - [ ] Original series
             - [x] TNG
             - [ ] DS9
             - [x] Voyager
             - [ ] Enterprise
             - [ ] Discovery

       The check may be upper or lower case.  A space must follow the right square bracket.

   <b>Definition</b> <b>Lists</b>
       Definition lists are a PHP Extra extension.  They're similar to lists except  in  having  key  and  value
       pairs, with keys being preceded by a blank line:

             Best understated characters:

             *Quark*
             : Armin Shimerman

             *Weyoun*
             : Jeffrey Combs

       Keys  consist  of a single line and may contain inline elements.  Like other lists, values may consist of
       arbitrary nested blocks.  There may be multiple consecutive values per key.  If the  key  and  value  are
       separated  by  a  blank  line,  the  list is emitted as if it contained block elements (usually output as
       spacing between key-value pairs).

   <b>Code</b> <b>Blocks</b>
       Code blocks consist of pre-formatted text, such as source code.  Each code block contains  opaque/literal
       text.   This  means  that new lines and white spaces are retained — they're not formatted in any way, and
       any text inside the code block is not interpreted.  To invoke a code block,  create  a  line  break  then
       indent each line with four spaces or one tab.

             Here is a paragraph about Bridge protocol

                 Here is a code block for the command "Engage"

       Within  a code block, text is escaped given the output format.  Therefore, characters that would normally
       need to be escaped in other text processing languages such as ampersands (“&amp;”) do not need to be escaped.

             Here is how you start the program xterm:

                 xterm &amp;

       Alternatively, code blocks are called “fenced” if they're surrounded in three or more matching  backticks
       or  tildes.  Code fences may optionally include the language used in the code fence following the header,
       such as in the following.

             ```c
             int main(void) {
               puts("Engage!");
               return 0;
             }
             ```

       The language, if provided, is usually passed into the output is auxiliary information  such  as  an  HTML
       class.

   <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Rules</b>
       A  horizontal  rule  is  a  line  that  goes across an output page.  These are invoked with three or more
       asterisks (“*”), hyphens (“-”), or underscores (“_”) on their own line.  Spaces between these  characters
       are disregarded.

             ***
             * * *
             ---
             - - -
             ___
             _ _ _
             ___________________________

   <b>Metadata</b>
       Documents  can include metadata that is not part of the main text.  The syntax follows the MMD and Pandoc
       specifications.

       In the MMD syntax, the block begins on the document's first line and  continues  until  the  first  blank
       line.   Keys and values are separated by a colon, and pairs separated by a newline.  A key (and following
       value) must exist on the line beginning the metadata pair, but the value may span multiple lines.

             Title: Captain's log
             Author: Captain J-L Picard
             Summary: As part of an exchange program, we're taking
              aboard a Klingon officer to return the recent visit
              of Commander Riker to the cruiser Pagh.
             Stardate: 43917.4

       Alternatively, a block of MMD metadata may begin with a line of "---" and end with "---" or "...".

       If there are multiple lines of text in a metadata value, subsequent lines should (but need not) be offset
       with whitespace.  Otherwise, they must not have a colon in the value, else they will be  construed  as  a
       subsequent pair's key.

       End  each  line  with  two spaces to ensure linebreaks are rendered on output for non-conforming Markdown
       renderers.  Moreover, beginning a document with a  regular  sentence  containing  a  colon  might  invoke
       metadata.  To escape this, add one blank line to the beginning of the document.

       Metadata  keys  must consist of alphanumeric ASCII characters, the hyphen ("-"), or the underscore ("_").
       They must have at least one character and are stripped of  white-space,  have  non-conforming  characters
       replaced with underscores, and converted to lower case.

       Metadata  values  are  opaque text: Markdown statements (e.g., italics, entities, etc.) are copied as-is.
       The values will have leading white-space stripped, i.e., space following the colon.

       If multiple metadata keys resolve to the same name, the last invocation is retained.  This check  happens
       after  canonicalising  the  name  by stripping spaces, converting to lower-case, and substituting unknown
       characters.

       In the Pandoc syntax, the block stops at the first line not  starting  with  a  percent  sign  or  space.
       Metadata  is limited to at most three keys: title, author(s), and date.  The first line is for title, the
       second (if provided) for author(s), and the third (also if provided) for date.   Lines  may  continue  by
       having  a subsequent line begin with a space.  If only one leading-percent line is included, the metadata
       is only for the title; if two, for a title and author(s); and so on.  If a leading-percent line is blank,
       the corresponding metadata is left empty (unspecified).

             % A Skin of Evil
             % Tasha Yar
               Armus
             % 1988-04-2525

             Wow what a day...

       Multiple authors may be separated by multiple white-space (including newlines), a semicolon, or both.

       The Pandoc title line is automatically scanned for whether it's a manpage-style title:

             % <a href="../man6/TREK.6.html">TREK</a>(6)

       <b>lowdown</b> recognises a manpage title from the open parenthesis followed by  a  number  (or  "n"),  optional
       following  characters,  then  a  closing  parenthesis.  If found, the title is broken down into title and
       section.  Any text following the title is further recognised as the source and,  if  a  vertical  bar  is
       detected, what comes after as the volume.

             % <a href="../man6/TREK.6.html">TREK</a>(6) OpenBSD | Games Manual

       These may be accessed with the <b>title</b> and <b>section</b> metadata keys, and optionally <b>volume</b> and <b>source</b>.

       Using either syntax, dates should be in the YYYY-MM-DD format, but can be in any format.  Metadata values
       may  be pasted into a document by referencing the <b>[%key]</b>, such as using the above example, again with the
       caveat that Markdown annotations (italics, etc.) are copied verbatim:

             date: 43917.4

             It's currently stardate [%date].

       Or using Pandoc:

             %
             %
             % 43917.4
             It's currently stardate [%date].

   <b>Mathematics</b>
       Mathematics support is an extension of Markdown.  The extension only describes how the math blocks  begin
       and  end:  the  contained  equations  are usually in LaTeX and implemented in the front-end (e.g., HTML).
       There are two types: inline and block.  Both may occur anywhere in a text stream.  Inline  equations  are
       rendered as part of the text; block equations are rendered on their own.

             This is an inline $f(x)$ function.
             This is a block $$f(x)$$ function.
             This is also an inline \\(f(x)\\) function.
             This is also a block \\[f(x)\\] function.

   <b>Tables</b>
       Tables  are  a  GFM  (GitHub-flavoured  Markdown) extension of the basic syntax.  They consist of a table
       header and body, and columns may be left, right, or centre justified.

             | Officer         | Rank                 |
             | --------------: | -------------------- |
             | Jean-Luc Picard | Captain              |
             | Worf            | Lieutenant Commander |
             | Data            | Lieutenant Commander |
             | William Riker   | Commander            |

       The table header must be followed by a line of hyphens with at  least  three  hyphen/colons  per  column.
       Columns  are  separated  by vertical bars.  The colon indicates alignment: a colon at the beginning means
       left justified; at the right for right justified, and both for centred.

       The leading and trailing column separator is superfluous.  Table data is not  necessary,  but  the  table
       header is.  The minimum table structure for the above is:

             Officer | Rank
             --:|---
             Jean-Luc Picard | Captain

       Table columns may contain arbitrary inline elements.

   <b>Footnote</b> <b>Definition</b>
       Footnotes  are  a MMD extension of the basic syntax.  Footnote definitions may occur anywhere in the text
       (except within blocks) and are “pointed to” by a “Footnote Reference”.  They consist of the footnote name
       (in square brackets, preceded by the caret), a colon, then everything  remaining  in  the  block  is  the
       footnote content.

             [^pt]:
                 Klingon insult, meaning something like "weirdo," deriving from
                 the verb "to be weird" (**taQ**), with and [sic] you (plural)
                 imperative prefix (**pe-**).

       Footnote contents may be on the same line as the colon.  The footnote name is rendered as a number.  If a
       footnote definition is not referred to, it is not printed.

   <b>HTML</b> <b>Blocks</b>
       Embedded  HTML  is  discouraged,  as  it inhibits formatting into non-HTML output, but is still accepted.
       Blocks of HTML must begin with a recognised HTML block-level element.

       In the original Markdown, block-level elements were well-defined  by  HTML4.   HTML5  elements  are  also
       accepted, but as there is no concept of block-level in HTML5, these are non-canonical.  Accepted elements
       are  <b>&lt;address&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;article&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;aside&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;blockquote&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;del&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;details&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;dialog&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;dd&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;div&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;dl&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;dt&gt;</b>,
       <b>&lt;fieldset&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;figcaption&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;figure&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;footer&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;form&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;h2&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;h3&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;h4&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;h5&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;h6&gt;</b>,  <b>&lt;header&gt;</b>,

       recognised, and need not be self-closed.

</pre><h4><b>INLINE</b> <b>ELEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Elements  within  a block element.  Sometimes called (inline) elements.  For example, normal text, a span
       of emphasised text, or a hyperlink.  An inline element cannot contain a block element,  but  can  contain
       other inline elements.

   <b>Emphasis</b>
       There  are  two  different  styles  of  emphasis: strong, usually rendered as bold; and emphasis, usually
       rendered as italics.  This is confusing, so sometimes the former is referred to  as  a  “double-emphasis”
       while the latter is a “single-emphasis”.

       Text  surrounded  by  a  single  asterisk  (“*”)  or  underscore  (“_”),  the single-emphasis variant, is
       traditionally rendered with italics.

             *Captain Picard*
             _Captain Picard_

       Text surrounded by a double asterisk  (“**”)  or  underscore  (“__”),  the  double-emphasis  variant,  is
       traditionally rendered as bold.

             **Jean-Luc Picard**
             __Jean-Luc Picard__

       Emphasis may occur within the middle of a word:

             En*ter*prise

       In  order  to produce a literal asterisk (“*”) or underscore (“_”) simply surround the character by white
       space.

             The ship * USS Enterprise * will not be emphasized

       Two additional types of double-emphasis are the strike-through and  highlight.   These  are  produced  by
       pairs of tilde and equal characters, respectively:

             ~~Kirk~~Picard is the best ==captain==.

       The  highlight  variant  may  be  enabled in <u><a href="../man1/lowdown.1.html">lowdown</a></u>(1) with highlight parsing enabled.  It's disabled by
       default because if used at the beginning of a line it may be erroneously interpreted as a section.

   <b>Links</b>
       There are two types of links: inline and reference.  In both cases, the linked text is denoted by  square
       brackets  (“[]”).   An  inline  link uses parentheses (“()”) containing the URL immediately following the
       linked text in square brackets to invoke the link.

             [text to link](https://bsd.lv)

       Local references may be absolute or relative paths:

             [Picard](/Picard)

       A reference link, on the other hand, keeps the URL outside of  the  text  —  usually  in  the  footnotes.
       Define  a  reference  link  anywhere  in a document by a title in square brackets (“[]”) followed a colon
       (“:”) followed by the corresponding URL or path, then an optional title.

             [link1]: https://www.bsd.lv/picard.jpg "Optional Title"

       The title may be delimited with single quotes, double quotes, or parenthesis.  It  is  only  rendered  in
       HTML  output.  It encompasses all text until the last delimiter before the end of line, so it may contain
       delimiters.  The title may be on its own line.

       Reference the link anywhere in your text using [text to the link] and the  same  [link  title],  both  in
       square brackets (“[]”) next to each other:

             Text about [Captain Picard][link1].

       References need not follow the definition: both may appear anywhere in relation to the other.

       Reference and inline links may be followed by PHP Extra attributes.

             Lowdown [homepage][home] or
             [github](https://github.com/kristapsdz/lowdown){ .gh #link1 }.

             [home]: https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown { .home #link2 }

       For  inline  links,  the  open  brace  must  immediately  follow the closing parenthesis.  Attributes are
       separated by spaces.

       Values with a leading period (".class") are interpreted as HTML (CSS) or OpenDocument classes, and values
       with a leading pound symbol ("#id") are interpreted as in-document link identifiers.

       Nested links are disallowed by CommonMark and will result in unportable behaviour if used.

   <b>Automatic</b> <b>Links</b>
       Automatic links are links to URLs or emails addresses that do not require text to links; rather, the full
       link or email address is inferred from the text.  To invoke an automatic link, surround the link or email
       address with angle brackets (“&lt;&gt;”), for example:

             &lt;https://bsd.lv/&gt;
             &lt;kristaps@localhost&gt;

   <b>Images</b>
       The image syntax resembles the links syntax.  The key difference is that images  require  an  exclamation
       mark (“!”) before the text to link surrounded by square brackets (“[]”).

             ![Image text](imageurl.jpg)

       Just like with links, there are both inline and reference image links.

       The  inline  style  consists  of  an  exclamation mark (“!”) followed by the alternate text (which may be
       empty) surrounded by square brackets “([])” followed by the URL or the path in parentheses “(())”.

       Unlike link text within square brackets, the alternate text is interpreted as-is.  Thus, passing Markdown
       or HTML entities will be passed directly to output (escaped according to output medium).  Alternate  text
       <u>may</u>  <u>not</u>  begin  with  the  caret  (“^”)  or  percent (“%”), else they will be interpreted as footnote or
       metadata references, respectively.

       The parentheses may contain optional dimensions (<u>width</u>x[<u>height</u>]) starting with an equal sign or a  quoted
       (single or double quotes) title in any order after the URL or path.  These dimensions are pixel sizes.

             ![Picard](https://bsd.lv/picard.jpg =250x250 'Engage!')

       The  reference  style  definition  consists  of  an image identifier surrounded by square brackets “([])”
       followed by a colon “(:)” followed by an image URL or path to  image  and  optional  title  attribute  in
       double quotation marks.

              [image1]: https://bsd.lv/picard.jpg "Picture of Picard"

       Invoking the image reference is as follows:

             A picture of the captain: ![Captain Picard][image1]

       As  with  regular  reference  links, the definition and references may occur anywhere in relation to each
       other.

       Images may also be followed by PHP Extra attributes for  classes,  identifiers,  and  width  and  height.
       Implementation of these depends on the output medium.

             ![Picard](https://bsd.lv/picard.jpg){width=20% .class}

       The open brace must immediately follow the closing parenthesis.  Attributes are separated by spaces.

       Value  pairs  "width=xx"  and "height=xx" are interpreted as HTML (CSS), OpenOffice, or LaTeX dimensions.
       These override set pixel dimensions.  Percentages are understood by all three media; otherwise, dimension
       units are interpreted according to the medium.

       Values with a leading period (".class") are interpreted as HTML (CSS) or OpenDocument classes, and values
       with a leading pound symbol ("#id") are interpreted as in-document link identifiers.

   <b>Code</b>
       In addition to code blocks, inline code spans may be specified within paragraphs or other block or inline
       elements.  To invoke a span of code, surround the code using backtick quotes (“`”).

             I need your IP address to scp you Picard pics.
             Use the `ifconfig iwm0` command.

       To include literal backticks (“`”) within a  code  span,  surround  the  code  using  multiple  backticks
       (“(``”).

             ``Here is a span of code with `backticks` inside it.``

       If you have a literal backtick at the start or end of the span of code, leave a space between the literal
       backtick and the delimiting backticks.

             `` `So many backticks.` ``

   <b>Footnote</b> <b>Reference</b>
       Footnotes  are  a  MMD  extension  of  the  basic  syntax.   Footnote references point into a block-level
       “Footnote Definition”.  They consist of the footnote name in square brackets, preceded by the caret.

             P'tahk[^pt], tell me who you are, or I will kill you right here!

       The footnote name is rendered as a number.  There may only be one footnote reference per definition.   If
       a  footnote  reference  refers to an unknown definition, or if it has already been used in referring to a
       definition, it is printed as-is.  Footnote  definitions  without  references  are  not  printed.   Nested
       footnotes are not allowed.

   <b>Superscripts</b>
       Uses  the  caret (“^”) to start a superscript, then another to end it.  Between these, white-space is not
       allowed.  This is the GFM style.

             Though a great book, Q^2^ isn't Star Trek canon.

       If "short" (traditional) style super-scripts are enabled, start with a caret, continuing to  white-space;
       or, if starting with an open parenthesis, continuing to the close parenthesis with possible white-space.

             Though a great book, Q^2 isn't Star Trek canon.

   <b>HTML</b> <b>Content</b>
       While  block-level  HTML must begin with a recognised block-level HTML element, span-level HTML need only
       begin and end with angle brackets, and not contain a hyperlink.

       Thus, <b>&lt;p&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;Leonard</b> <b>Nimoy&gt;</b>, and <b>&lt;span</b> <b>class="foo"&gt;</b> are all accepted.  Even  malformed  content,  such  as
       <b>&lt;span</b> <b>class="foo&gt;</b> is accepted, so long as it begins and ends with angle brackets.

</pre><h4><b>ESCAPES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Automatic</b> <b>Escapes</b>
       Output is automatically escaped depending upon the medium.  For example, HTML output will properly escape
       angle  brackets  “(&lt;)” and ampersands “(&amp;)” to produce conformant HTML.  The same goes with <u><a href="../man7/man.7.html">man</a></u>(7) output
       in escaping leading periods and so forth.

   <b>Backslash</b> <b>Escapes</b>
       Backslash escapes render literal characters that would otherwise invoke  a  particular  block  or  inline
       element.  For example, surrounding a phrase with single asterisks renders it as an emphasis:

             *Captain Picard*

       However,  if  you  want  to  invoke  those  italics  as  literal characters, escape those asterisks using
       backslashes (“\”).

             \*Captain Picard\*

       The following characters may be escaped to produce literal text:

             <b>*</b>       asterisk
             <b>\</b>       backslash
             <b>`</b>       backtick
             <b>{</b>       curly brace
             <b>!</b>       exclamation mark
             <b>#</b>       hash mark
             <b>-</b>       minus sign
             <b>(</b>       parentheses
             <b>.</b>       period
             <b>+</b>       plus sign
             <b>[</b>       square bracket
             <b>_</b>       underscore

</pre><h4><b>TYPOGRAPHY</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man1/lowdown.1.html">lowdown</a></u>(1) renders certain character sequences for easier reading.  This is  called  "smart  formatting".
       The  following  character sequences are converted to output-specific glyphs.  The table shows whether the
       sequences must be on word boundaries.

             "        left-double      left word boundary
             "        right-double     right word boundary
             '        left-single      left word boundary
             '        right-single     not left word boundary

       Word boundaries are defined by white-space (including the end of blocks, such as paragraphs,  or  end  of
       file)  or  punctuation.  Left word boundary refers to white-space or a left parenthesis or square bracket
       to the left of the sequence.  Right refers to white-space or punctuation to the right.

       Smart quotes (single and double) are not context aware: using a left or  right  quote  depends  upon  the
       characters surrounding the quote, not whether a prior quote mark has already been used.
