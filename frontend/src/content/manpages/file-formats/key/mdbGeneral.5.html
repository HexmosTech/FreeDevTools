       mdbGeneral - General Format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The mdatabase_load() function returns the data specified by tags in the form of plist if the first tag is
       not Mchartable nor Mcharset. The keys of the returned plist are limited to Minteger, Msymbol, Mtext, and
       Mplist. The type of the value is unambiguously determined by the corresponding key. If the key is
       Minteger, the value is an integer. If the key is Msymbol, the value is a symbol. And so on.

       A number of expressions are possible to represent a plist. For instance, we can use the form (K1:V1,
       K2:V2, ..., Kn:Vn) to represent a plist whose first property key and value are K1 and V1, second key and
       value are K2 and V2, and so on. However, we can use a simpler expression here because the types of plists
       used in the m17n database are fairly restricted.

       Hereafter, we use an expression, which is similar to S-expression, to represent a plist. (Actually, the
       default database loader of the m17n library is designed to read data files written in this expression.)

       The expression consists of one or more <u>elements</u>. Each element represents a property, i.e. a single
       element of a plist.

       Elements are separated by one or more <u>whitespaces</u>, i.e. a space (code 32), a tab (code 9), or a newline
       (code 10). Comments begin with a semicolon (;) and extend to the end of the line.

       The key and the value of each property are determined based on the type of the element as explained
       below.

       • INTEGER
       An  element that matches the regular expression -?[0-9]+ or 0[xX][0-9A-Fa-f]+ represents a property whose
       key is Minteger. An element matching the former expression  is  interpreted  as  an  integer  in  decimal
       notation,  and one matching the latter is interpreted as an integer in hexadecimal notation. The value of
       the property is the result of interpretation.
       For instance, the element 0xA0 represents a property whose value is 160 in decimal.
       • SYMBOL
       An element that matches the regular expression [^-(0-9]([^\()]|\.)+ represents a property  whose  key  is
       Msymbol.  In  the element, \t, \n, \r, and \e are replaced with tab (code 9), newline (code 10), carriage
       return (code 13),  and  escape  (code  27)  respectively.  Other  characters  following  a  backslash  is
       interpreted as it is. The value of the property is the symbol having the resulting string as its name.
       For  instance,  the element abc\ def represents a property whose value is the symbol having the name 'abc
       def'.
       • MTEXT
       An element that matches the regular expression '([^']|\')*' represents a property whose key is Mtext. The
       backslash escape explained above also applies here. r, each part in  the  element  matching  the  regular
       expression  \[xX][0-9A-Fa-f][0-9A-Fa-f] is replaced with its hexadecimal interpretation.
       After  having  resolved the backslash escapes, the byte sequence between the double quotes is interpreted
       as a UTF-8 sequence and decoded into an M-text. This M-text is the value of the property.
       • PLIST
       Zero or more elements surrounded by a pair of parentheses represent  a  property  whose  key  is  Mplist.
       Whitespaces before and after a parenthesis can be omitted. The value of the property is a plist, which is
       the result of recursive interpretation of the elements between the parentheses.
</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b> <b>NOTATION</b></h4><pre>
       In  an explanation of a plist format of data, a BNF-like notation is used. In the notation, non-terminals
       are represented by a string of uppercase letters (including '-' in the middle), terminals are represented
       by a string surrounded by '''. Special non-terminals INTEGER, SYMBOL, MTEXT and PLIST represents property
       integer, symbol, M-text, or plist respectively.
</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Here is an example of database data that is read into a plist of this simple format:
       DATA-FORMAT ::=
           [ INTEGER | SYMBOL | MTEXT | FUNC ] *

       FUNC ::=
           '(' FUNC-NAME FUNC-ARG * ')'

       FUNC-NAME ::=
           SYMBOL

       FUNC-ARG ::=
           INTEGER | SYMBOL | MTEXT | '(' FUNC-ARG ')'
       For instance, a data file that contains this text matches the above syntax:
       abc 123 (pqr 0xff) "m
       and is read into this plist:
       1st element: key: Msymbol,  value: abc
       2nd element: key: Minteger, value: 123
       3rd element: key: Mplist,   value: a plist of these elements:
           1st element: key Msymbol,  value: pgr
           2nd element: key Minteger, value: 255
       4th element: key: Mtext,    value: m"text
       5th element: key: Mplist,   value: a plist of these elements:
           1st element: key: Msymbol, value: __
           2nd element: key: Mplist,  value: a plist of these elements:
               1st element: key: Mtext,    value: string
           2nd element: key: Msymbol,  value: xyz
           3rd element: key: Minteger, value: -456
