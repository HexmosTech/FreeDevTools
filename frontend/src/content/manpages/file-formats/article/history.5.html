       history - Record of current and recently expired Usenet articles

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The file <u>pathdb</u>/history keeps a record of all articles currently stored in the news system, as well as
       those that have been received but since expired.  In a typical production environment, this file will be
       many megabytes.

       The file consists of text lines.  Each line corresponds to one article.  The file is normally kept sorted
       in the order in which articles are received, although this is not a requirement.  <b>innd</b> appends a new line
       each time it files an article, and <b>expire</b> builds a new version of the file by removing old articles and
       purging old entries.

       Each line consists of two or three fields separated by a tab, shown below as " \t ":

           [hash] \t date
           [hash] \t date \t @token@

       The <u>hash</u> field is the ASCII representation of the hash of the Message-ID.  This is directly used for the
       key of the <u>dbz</u>.

       The <u>date</u> field consists of three sub-fields separated by a tilde.  All sub-fields are the text
       representation of the number of seconds since the epoch, that is to say a <u>time_t</u> like in
       "<a href="../man2/gettimeofday.2.html">gettimeofday</a>(2)".  The first sub-field is the article's arrival date.  If copies of the article are
       still present, then the second sub-field is either the value of the article's Expires header field, or a
       hyphen if no expiration date was specified.  If an article has been expired, then the second sub-field
       will be a hyphen.  The third sub-field is the value of the article's Date header field, recording when
       the article was posted.

       The <u>token</u> field is a token of the article.  This field is empty if the article has been expired.

       For example, an article whose Message-ID was &lt;7q2saq$sal$<a href="mailto:1@isrv4.pa.vix.com">1@isrv4.pa.vix.com</a>&gt;, posted on 26 Aug 1999
       08:02:34 GMT and received at 26 Aug 1999 08:06:54 GMT, could have a history line (broken into three lines
       for display) like the following:

           [E6184A5BC2898A35A3140B149DE91D5C] \t
               935678987~-~935678821 \t
               @030154574F00000000000007CE3B000004BA@

       In addition to the text file, there is a <u>dbz</u> database associated with the file that uses the Message-ID
       field as a key to determine the offset in the text file where the associated line begins.  For historical
       reasons, the key includes the trailing "\0" byte (which is not stored in the text file).
