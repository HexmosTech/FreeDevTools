       Further options for FSVS. -

       List of settings that modify FSVS' behaviour.  List of settings that modify FSVS' behaviour.

       FSVS understands some options that modify its behaviour in various small ways.

</pre><h4><b>Overview</b></h4><pre>

       • waa - <b>waa</b>.
   <b>Priorities</b> <b>for</b> <b>option</b> <b>setting</b>
       The priorities are

       • Command line (highest)
       • Environment variables. These are named as FSVS_<u>{upper-case</u> <u>option</u> <u>name}</u>.
       • $HOME/.fsvs/wc-dir/config
       • $FSVS_CONF/wc-dir/config
       • $HOME/.fsvs/config
       • $FSVS_CONF/config
       • Default value, compiled in (lowest)
       <b>Note:</b>
           The $HOME-dependent configuration files are not implemented currently. Volunteers?
       Furthermore  there are 'intelligent' run-time dependent settings, like turning off colour output when the
       output is redirected. Their priority is just below the command line - so they can always be overridden if
       necessary.
   <b>Examples</b>
       Using the commandline:
            fsvs -o path=environment
            fsvs -opath=environment

        Using environment variables:
            FSVS_PATH=absolute fsvs st

        A configuration file, from $FSVS_CONF/config or in a WC-specific path below $FSVS_CONF:
            # FSVS configuration file
            path=wcroot

</pre><h4><b>Output</b> <b>settings</b> <b>and</b> <b>entry</b> <b>filtering</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Trimming</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>deleted</b> <b>entries</b>
       If you remove a directory, all entries below are implicitly known to be deleted, too. To make the  <b>status</b>
       output shorter there's the all_removed option which, if set to no, will cause children of removed entries
       to be omitted.
       Example for the config file:
           all_removed=no

   <b>Ignore</b> <b>mtime-metadata</b> <b>changes</b> <b>for</b> <b>directories</b>
       When this option is enabled, directories where only the mtime changed are not reported on <b>status</b> anymore.
       This  is  useful  in  situations  where  temporary files are created in directories, eg. by text editors.
       (Example: VIM swapfiles when no directory option is configured).
       Example for the config file:
           dir_exclude_mtime=yes

   <b>Directory</b> <b>sorting</b>
       If you'd like to have the output of <b>status</b> sorted, you can use the option dir_sort=yes. FSVS  will  do  a
       run  through  the  tree,  to  read the status of the entries, and then go through it again, but sorted by
       name.
       <b>Note:</b>
           If FSVS aborts with an error during <b>status</b> output, you might want to turn this option off  again,  to
           see where FSVS stops; the easiest way is on the command line with -odir_sort=no.
   <b>Filtering</b> <b>entries</b>
       Please see the command line parameter for <b>-f</b>, which is identical.
           fsvs -o filter=mtime
   <b>'fsvs</b> <b>log'</b> <b>revision</b> <b>limit</b>
       There are some defaults for the number of revisions that are shown on a 'fsvs log' command:

       • 2 revisions given (-rX:Y): abs(X-Y)+1, ie. all revisions in that range.
       • 1 revision given: exactly that one.
       • no revisions given: from HEAD to 1, with a maximum of 100.
       As  this  option  can  only  be  used to set an upper limit of revisions, it makes most sense for the no-
       revision-arguments case.
   <b>'fsvs</b> <b>log'</b> <b>output</b> <b>format</b>
       You can modify aspects of the <b>fsvs</b> <b>log</b> output format by setting the log_output option to a combination of
       these flags:

       • color: This uses color in the output, similar to cg-log (cogito-log); the header  and  separator  lines
         are highlighted.
       <b>Note:</b>
           This  uses  ANSI escape sequences, and tries to restore the default color; if you know how to do that
           better (and more compatible), please tell the developer mailing list.
       • indent: Additionally you can shift the log message itself a space to the right,  to  make  the  borders
         clearer.
       Furthermore the value normal is available; this turns off all special handling.
       <b>Note:</b>
           If  you  start  such  an option, the value is reset; so if you specify log_output=color,indent in the
           global config file, and use log_output=color on the  commandline,  only  colors  are  used.  This  is
           different to the <b>Filtering</b> <b>entries</b> option, which is cumulating.
   <b>Displaying</b> <b>paths</b>
       You  can  specify how paths printed by FSVS should look like; this is used for the entry status output of
       the various actions, and for the diff header lines.
       There are several possible settings, of which one can be chosen via the path option.
       •
          wcroot
          This is the old, traditional FSVS setting, where all paths are printed relative to  the  working  copy
         root.
       •
          parameter
          With  this  setting  FSVS  works  like most other programs - it uses the first best-matching parameter
         given by the user, and appends the rest of the path.
          This is the new default.
       <b>Note:</b>
           Internally FSVS still first parses all arguments, and then does a single run through the entries.  So
           if some entry matches more than one parameter, it is printed using the first match.
       •
          absolute
          All  paths  are printed in absolute form. This is useful if you want to paste them into other consoles
         without worrying whether the current directory matches, or for using them in pipelines.
       The next two are nearly identical to absolute, but the beginning of paths are substituted by  environment
       variables. This makes sense if you want the advantage of full paths, but have some of them abbreviated.

       •
          environment
          Match  variables to directories after reading the known entries, and use this cached information. This
         is faster, but might miss the best case if new entries are found (which would not  be  checked  against
         possible longer hits).
          Furthermore, as this works via associating environment variables to entries, the environment variables
         must at least match the working copy base - shorter paths won't be substituted.
       • full-environment
          Check for matches just before printing the path.
          This is slower, but finds the best fit.
       <b>Note:</b>
           The  string  of the environment variables must match a directory name; the filename is always printed
           literally, and partial string matches are not allowed. Feedback wanted.
           Only environment variables whose names start with WC  are  used  for  substitution,  to  avoid  using
           variables  like  $PWD,  $OLDPWD,  $HOME  and  similar  which might differ between sessions. Maybe the
           allowed prefixes for the environment variables should be settable in the configuration.  Opinions  to
           the users mailing list, please.
       Example, with / as working copy base:
       $ cd <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>

       $ fsvs -o path=wcroot st

       $ fsvs -o path=absolute st

       $ fsvs -o path=parameters st
       $ fsvs -o path=parameters st .
       $ fsvs -o path=parameters st /
       $ fsvs -o path=parameters st X11
       $ fsvs -o path=parameters st ..<a href="file:/dev/..">/dev/..</a>
       $ fsvs -o path=parameters st X11 ..<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>
       $ fsvs -o path=parameters st ..<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a> X11

       $ fsvs -o path=environ st
       $ WCBAR=<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a> fsvs -o path=wcroot st
       $ WCBAR=<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a> fsvs -o path=wcroot st /
       $ WCBAR=/e fsvs -o path=wcroot st
       $ WCBAR=<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a> WCFOO=<a href="file:/etc/X11">/etc/X11</a> fsvs -o path=wcroot st

       $ touch /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
       $ fsvs -o path=parameters st
       $ fsvs -o path=parameters st X11 /etc/X11/xinit

       <b>Note:</b>
           At  least  for  the  command  line  options  the strings can be abbreviated, as long as they're still
           identifiable. Please use the full strings in the configuration file,  to  avoid  having  problems  in
           future versions when more options are available.
   <b>Status</b> <b>output</b> <b>coloring</b>
       FSVS  can  colorize  the  output of the status lines; removed entries will be printed in red, new ones in
       green, and otherwise changed in blue. Unchanged (for -v) will be given in the default color.
       For this you can set stat_color=yes; this is turned off per default.
       As with the other colorizing options this gets turned off automatically if the output is not on a tty; on
       the command line you can override this, though.
   <b>Checking</b> <b>for</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>script</b>
       If you want to use FSVS in scripts, you might simply want to know whether anything was changed.
       In this case use the stop_on_change option, possibly combined with <b>Filtering</b> <b>entries</b>; this gives  you  no
       output on STDOUT, but an error code on the first change seen:
           fsvs -o stop_change=yes st <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>
               if fsvs status -o stop_change=yes -o filter=text <a href="file:/etc/init.d">/etc/init.d</a>
               then
                   echo No change found ...
               else
                   echo Changes seen.
               fi

   <b>Verbosity</b> <b>flags</b>
       If  you  want  a  bit  more control about the data you're getting you can use some specific flags for the
       verbose options.
       • none,veryquiet - reset the bitmask, don't display anything.
       • quiet - only a few output lines.
       • changes - the characters showing what has changed for an entry.
       • size - the size for files, or the textual description (like 'dir').
       • path - the path of the file, formatted according to <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>option</b>.
       • default - The default value, ie. changes, size and name.
       • meta - One more than the default so it can be used via a single '-v',  it  marks  that  the  mtime  and
         owner/group  changes  get  reported  as  two  characters.If  '-v' is used to achieve that, even entries
         without changes are reported, unless overridden by <b>Filtering</b> <b>entries</b>.
       • url - Displays the entries' top priority URL
       • copyfrom - Displays the URL this entry has been copied from (see <b>copy</b>).
       • group - The group this entry belongs to, see <b>group</b>
       • urls - Displays all known URLs of this entry
       • stacktrace - Print the full stacktrace when reporting errors; useful for debugging.
       • all - Sets all flags. Mostly useful for debugging.
       Please note that if you want to display <b>fewer</b> items than per default, you'll have to  clear  the  bitmask
       first, like this:
           fsvs status -o verbose=none,changes,path

</pre><h4><b>Diffing</b> <b>and</b> <b>merging</b> <b>on</b> <b>update</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Options</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>'diff'</b> <b>action</b>
       The  diff  is  not  done  internally  in  FSVS,  but  some  other  program  is called, to get the highest
       flexibility.
       There are several option values:

       • diff_prg: The executable name, default 'diff'.
       • diff_opt: The default options, default '-pu'.
       • diff_extra: Extra options, no default.
       The call is done as
           $diff_prg $diff_opt $file1 --label '$label1' $file2 --label '$label2' $diff_extra

       <b>Note:</b>
           In diff_opt you should use only use command line flags without  parameters;  in  diff_extra  you  can
           encode  a single flag with parameter (like '-U5'). If you need more flexibility, write a shell script
           and pass its name as diff_prg.
       Advanced users might be interested in <b>exported</b> <b>environment</b> <b>variables</b>, too; with their help  you  can  eg.
       start different diff programs depending on the filename.
   <b>Using</b> <b>colordiff</b>
       If you have colordiff installed on your system, you might be interested in the colordiff option.
       It can take one of these values:

       • no, off or false: Don't use colordiff.
       • empty  (default  value):  Try  to  use colordiff as executable, but don't throw an error if it can't be
         started; just pipe the data as-is to STDOUT. (<u>Auto</u> mode.)
       • anything else: Pipe the output of the diff program (see <b>Options</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>'diff'</b> <b>action</b>)  to  the
         given executable.
       Please note that if STDOUT is not a tty (eg. is redirected into a file), this option must be given on the
       command line to take effect.
   <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>on</b> <b>update</b>
       If you start an update, but one of the entries that was changed in the repository is changed locally too,
       you get a conflict.
       There are some ways to resolve a conflict:

       • local - Just take the local entry, ignore the repository.
       • remote - Overwrite any local change with the remote version.
       • both  -  Keep  the  local  modifications  in the file renamed to <u>filename</u>.mine<u>,</u> <u>and</u> <u>save</u> <u>the</u> <u>repository</u>
         <u>version</u> <u>as</u> <u>filename.rXXX,</u> <u>ie.</u> <u>put</u> <u>the</u> <u>revision</u> <u>number</u> <u>after</u> <u>the</u> <u>filename.</u>
       The conflict must be solved manually, and the solution made known to FSVS via the <b>resolve</b> command.
       <b>Note:</b>
           As there's no known <u>good</u> version after this renaming, a zero byte file gets created.
            Any <b>resolve</b> or  <b>revert</b>  command  would  make  that  current,  and  the  changes  that  are  kept  in
           <u>filename</u>.mine <u>would</u> <u>be</u> <u>lost!</u>
            <u>You</u> <u>should</u> <u>only</u> <b>revert</b> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>last</u> <u>repository</u> <u>version,</u> <u>ie.</u> <u>the</u> <u>data</u> <u>of</u> <u>filename.rXXX.</u>
       • merge - Call the program merge with the common ancestor, the local and the remote version.
       If  it  is a clean merge, no further work is necessary; else you'll get the (partly) merged file, and the
       two other versions just like with the both variant, and (again) have to tell FSVS that  the  conflict  is
       solved, by using the <b>resolve</b> command.
       <b>Note:</b>
           As in the subversion command line client svn the auxiliary files are seen as new, although that might
           change in the future (so that they automatically get ignored).
   <b>Options</b> <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>'merge'</b> <b>program</b>
       Like with <b>diff</b>, the merge operation is not done internally in FSVS.
       To have better control

       • merge_prg: The executable name, default 'merge'.
       • merge_opt: The default options, default '-A'.
       The option '-p' is always used:
           $merge_prg $merge_opt -p $file1 $common $file2

</pre><h4><b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>commit</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Author</b>
       You  can  specify  an  author  to  be  used  on commit. This option has a special behaviour; if the first
       character of the value is an '$', the value is replaced by the environment variable named.
       Empty strings are ignored; that allows an /etc/fsvs/config like this:
         author=unknown
         author=$LOGNAME
         author=$SUDO_USER

        where the last non-empty value is taken; and if your .authorized_keys has lines like
         environment='FSVS_AUTHOR=some_user' ssh-rsa ...

        that would override the config values.
       <b>Note:</b>
           Your sshd_config needs the PermitUserEnvironment setting; you can also take a look at  the  AcceptEnv
           and SendEnv documentation.
   <b>Destination</b> <b>URL</b> <b>for</b> <b>commit</b>
       If you defined multiple URLs for your working copy, FSVS needs to know which URL to commit to.
       For this you would set commit_to to the <b>name</b> of the URL; see this example:
               fsvs urls N:master,P:10,http://... N:local,P:20,file:///...
               fsvs ci <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> -m 'New user defined' -ocommit_to=local

   <b>Doing</b> <b>empty</b> <b>commits</b>
       In  the default settings FSVS will happily create empty commits, ie. revisions without any changed entry.
       These just have a revision number, an author and a timestamp; this is nice if FSVS is run via  CRON,  and
       you want to see when FSVS gets run.
       If you would like to avoid such revisions, set this option to no; then such commits will be avoided.
       Example:
               fsvs commit -o empty_commit=no -m 'cron' <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>

   <b>Avoid</b> <b>commits</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>commit</b> <b>message</b>
       If you don't like the behaviour that FSVS does commits with an empty message received from $EDITOR (eg if
       you found out that you don't want to commit after all), you can change this option to no; then FSVS won't
       allow empty commit messages.
       Example for the config file:
               empty_message=no

   <b>Creating</b> <b>directories</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>repository</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>URL</b>
       If  you  want  to  keep  some  data  versioned,  the  first  commit  is normally the creation of the base
       directories <b>above</b> the given URL (to keep that data separate from the other repository data).
       Previously this had to be done manually, ie. with a svn mkdir $URL --parents or similar command.
        With the mkdir_base option you can tell FSVS to create directories as needed; this is mostly  useful  on
       the first commit.
               fsvs urls ...
               fsvs group 'group:ignore,./**'

   <b>Waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>change</b> <b>after</b> <b>working</b> <b>copy</b> <b>operations</b>
       If you're using FSVS in automated systems, you might see that changes that happen in the same second as a
       commit are not seen with <b>status</b> later; this is because the timestamp granularity of FSVS is 1 second.
       For backward compatibility the default value is no (don't delay). You can set it to any combination of

       • commit,
       • update,
       • revert and/or
       • checkout;
       for yes all of these actions are delayed until the clock seconds change.
       Example how to set that option via an environment variable:
               export FSVS_DELAY=commit,revert

</pre><h4><b>Performance</b> <b>and</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>related</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Change</b> <b>detection</b>
       This options allows one to specify the trade-off between speed and accuracy.
       A  file  with  a  changed  size can immediately be known as changed; but if only the modification time is
       changed, this is not so easy. Per default FSVS does a MD5 check on the file in this case;  if  you  don't
       want  that, or if you want to do the checksum calculation for <b>every</b> file (in case a file has changed, but
       its mtime not), you can use this option to change FSVS' behaviour.
       On the command line there's a shortcut for that: for every '-C' another check in this option is chosen.
       The recognized specifications are noneResets the check bitmask to 'no checks'. file_mtimeCheck files  for
       modifications (via MD5) and directories for new entries, if the mtime is different - default dirCheck all
       directories  for  new  entries, regardless of the timestamp. allfilesCheck <b>all</b> files with MD5 for changes
       (tripwire -like operation). fullAll available checks.
       You can give multiple options; they're accumulated unless overridden by none.
           fsvs -o change_check=allfiles status

       <b>Note:</b>
           <u>commit</u> and <u>update</u> set a<b>ef</b>i<b>cpfd</b>a<b>'copyfrom-detect'</b>n, to avoid missing new files.
   <b>Avoiding</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>compares</b> <b>on</b>
       If you've got big files that are seen as new, doing the MD5 comparison can be time consuming. So  there's
       the option copyfrom_exp (for <u>'expensive'</u>, which takes the usual yes (default) and no arguments.
               fsvs copyfrom-detect -o copyfrom_exp=no some_directory
   <b>Getting</b> <b>grouping/ignore</b> <b>statistics</b>
       If  you need to ignore many entries of your working copy, you might find that the ignore pattern matching
       takes some valuable time.
        In order to optimize the order of your patterns you can specify this option to print the number of tests
       and matches for each pattern.
               $ fsvs status -o group_stats=yes -q

               Grouping statistics (tested, matched, groupname, pattern):

               4705  80   ignore   group:ignore,.
       For optimizing you'll want to put often matching patterns at the front (to make them  match  sooner,  and
       avoid  unnecessary  tests);  but  if you are using other groups than ignore (like take), you will have to
       take care to keep the patterns within a group together.
       Please note that the first line shows how many entries were tested, and that the next lines differ by the
       number of matches entries for the current line, as all entries being  tested  against  some  pattern  get
       tested for the next too, <b>unless</b> <b>they</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>pattern</b>.
       This option is available for <b>status</b> and the <b>ignore</b> <b>test</b> commands.
</pre><h4><b>Base</b> <b>configuration</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Path</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>config</b> <b>and</b> <b>WAA</b> <b>area</b>
       The paths given here are used to store the persistent configuration data needed by FSVS; please see <b>Files</b>
       <b>used</b>  <b>by</b>  <b>fsvs</b>  and  <b>Priorities</b>  <b>for</b>  <b>option</b>  <b>setting</b>  for  more details, and the <b>Using</b> <b>an</b> <b>alternate</b> <b>root</b>
       <b>directory</b> parameter as well as the <b>Recovery</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-booting</b> <b>system</b> for further discussion.
           FSVS_CONF=/home/user/.fsvs-conf fsvs -o waa=/home/user/.fsvs-waa st
       <b>Note:</b>
           Please note that these paths can be given <b>only</b> as environment variables ($FSVS_CONF resp.  $FSVS_WAA)
           or as command line parameter; settings in config files are ignored.
   <b>Configuration</b> <b>directory</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>subversion</b> <b>libraries</b>
       This  path  specifies  where the subversion libraries should take their configuration data from; the most
       important aspect of that is authentication data, especially for certificate authentication.
       The default value is $FSVS_CONF/svn/.
       /etc/fsvs/config could have eg.
           config_dir=/root/.subversion

       Please note that this directory can hold an auth directory, and the servers and config files.
   <b>Using</b> <b>an</b> <b>alternate</b> <b>root</b> <b>directory</b>
       This is a path that is prepended to $FSVS_WAA and $FSVS_CONF (or their default values, see <b>Files</b> <b>used</b>  <b>by</b>
       <b>fsvs</b>), if they do not already start with it, and it is cut off for the directory-name MD5 calculation.
       When  is  that needed? Imagine that you've booted from some Live-CD like Knoppix; if you want to setup or
       restore a non-working system, you'd have to transfer all files needed by the FSVS binary to it, and  then
       start in some kind of chroot environment.
       With  this parameter you can tell FSVS that it should load its libraries from the current filesystem, but
       use the given path as root directory for its administrative data.
       This is used for recovery; see the example in <b>Recovery</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-booting</b> <b>system</b>.
       So how does this work?

       • The internal data paths derived from $FSVS_WAA and $FSVS_CONF use the value given  for  softroot  as  a
         base directory, if they do not already start with it.
          (If  that  creates  a  conflict  for  you,  eg. in that you want to use <a href="file:/var">/var</a> as the softroot, and your
         $FSVS_WAA should be /var/fsvs, you can make the string comparison  fail  by  using  <a href="file:/./var">/./var</a>  for  either
         path.)
       • When  a  directory  name  for $FSVS_CONF or $FSVS_WAA is derived from some file path, the part matching
         softroot is cut off, so that the generated names match the situation after rebooting.
       Previously you'd have to <b>export</b> your data back to the filesystem and call <b>urls</b> 'fsvs urls' and FSVS <b>sync-</b>
       <b>repos</b> again, to get the WAA data back.
       <b>Note:</b>
           A plain chroot() would not work, as some needed programs (eg. the decoder  for  update,  see  <b>Special</b>
           <b>property</b> <b>names</b>) would not be available.
           The  easy  way  to  understand softroot is: If you want to do a chroot() into the given directory (or
           boot with it as /), you'll want this set.
           As this value is used for finding the correct working copy root (by trying to find  a  <b>conf-path</b>,  it
           cannot  be  set from a per-wc config file. Only the environment, global configuration or command line
           parameter make sense.
</pre><h4><b>Debugging</b> <b>and</b> <b>diagnosing</b></h4><pre>
       The next two options could be set in the global configuration file, to automatically get the  last  debug
       messages when an error happens.
       To  provide  an  easy way to get on-line debugging again, debug_output and debug_buffer are both reset to
       non-redirected, on-line output, if more than a single -d is specified on the command line, like this:
       fsvs commit -m '...'  -d -d filenames

       In this case you'll get a message telling you about that.
   <b>Destination</b> <b>for</b> <b>debug</b> <b>output</b>
       You can specify the debug output destination with the option debug_output. This can be a simple  filename
       (which gets truncated on open), or, if it starts with a |, a command that the output gets piped into.
       If  the  destination cannot be opened (or none is given), debug output goes to STDOUT (for easier tracing
       via less).
       Example:
       fsvs -o debug_output=/tmp/debug.out -d st <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>

       <b>Note:</b>
           That string is taken only once - at the first debug output line. So you have to use the correct order
           of parameters: -o debug_output=... -d.
       An example: writing the last 200 lines of debug output into a file.
       fsvs -o debug_output='| tail -200 &gt; /tmp/debug.log' -d ....

   <b>Using</b> <b>a</b> <b>debug</b> <b>buffer</b>
       With the debug_buffer option you can specify the size of a buffer (in kB) that is  used  to  capture  the
       output, and which gets printed automatically if an error occurs.
       This must be done <b>before</b> debugging starts, like with the <b>debug_output</b> specification.
       fsvs -o debug_buffer=128 ...
       <b>Note:</b>
           If  this  option  is  specified  in the configuration file or via the environment, only the buffer is
           allocated; if it is used on the command line, debugging is automatically turned on, too.
   <b>Setting</b> <b>warning</b> <b>behaviour</b>
       Please see the command line parameter <b>-W</b>, which is identical.
           fsvs -o warning=diff-status=ignore
