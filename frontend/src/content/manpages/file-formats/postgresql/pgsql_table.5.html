</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pgsql_table - Postfix PostgreSQL client configuration

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>postmap</b> <b>-q</b> <b>"</b><u>string</u><b>"</b> <b>pgsql:/etc/postfix/</b><u>filename</u>

       <b>postmap</b> <b>-q</b> <b>-</b> <b>pgsql:/etc/postfix/</b><u>filename</u> <b>&lt;</b><u>inputfile</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Postfix  mail  system  uses  optional tables for address rewriting or mail routing. These tables are
       usually in <b>dbm</b> or <b>db</b> format.

       Alternatively, lookup tables can be specified as  PostgreSQL  databases.   In  order  to  use  PostgreSQL
       lookups, define a PostgreSQL source as a lookup table in main.cf, for example:
           alias_maps = pgsql:/etc/postfix/pgsql-aliases.cf

       The  file  /etc/postfix/pgsql-aliases.cf has the same format as the Postfix main.cf file, and can specify
       the parameters described below.

</pre><h4><b>LIST</b> <b>MEMBERSHIP</b></h4><pre>
       When using SQL to store lists such as $mynetworks, $mydestination, $relay_domains, $local_recipient_maps,
       etc., it is important to understand that the table must store each list member as  a  separate  key.  The
       table   lookup  verifies  the  *existence*  of  the  key.  See  "Postfix  lists  versus  tables"  in  the
       DATABASE_README document for a discussion.

       Do NOT create tables that return the full list of domains in $mydestination or $relay_domains etc., or IP
       addresses in $mynetworks.

       DO create tables with each matching item as a key and with an arbitrary value. With SQL databases  it  is
       not uncommon to return the key itself or a constant value.

</pre><h4><b>PGSQL</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hosts</b>  The hosts that Postfix will try to connect to and query from. Besides a PostgreSQL connection URI,
              this   setting   supports   the  historical  forms  <b>unix:/</b><u>pathname</u>  for  UNIX-domain  sockets  and
              <b>inet:</b><u>host:port</u> for TCP connections, where the <b>unix:</b> and <b>inet:</b> prefixes are  accepted  and  ignored
              for backwards compatibility.  Examples:
                  hosts = postgresql://<a href="mailto:username@example.com">username@example.com</a>/<u>databasename</u>?sslmode=require
                  hosts = postgres://user:secret@localhost
                  hosts = inet:host1.some.domain inet:host2.some.domain:port
                  hosts = host1.some.domain host2.some.domain:port
                  hosts = unix:/file/name

              See  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html  for  the supported connection URI
              syntax.

              The hosts are tried in random order. The connections are automatically closed after being idle for
              about 1 minute, and are re-opened as necessary. See <b>idle_interval</b> for details.

              NOTE: if the <b>hosts</b> setting specifies a PostgreSQL connection URI, the  Postfix  PostgreSQL  client
              will ignore the <b>dbname</b>, <b>user</b>, and <b>password</b> settings for that connection.

              NOTE:  if  the  <b>hosts</b>  setting specifies one server, this client assumes that the target is a load
              balancer and will reconnect immediately after a single failure, instead of  failing  all  requests
              temporarily. With older versions of this client, specify the same server twice.

       <b>user</b>

       <b>password</b>
              The user name and password to log into the pgsql server.  Example:
                  user = someone
                  password = some_password

              The <b>user</b> and <b>password</b> settings are ignored for <b>hosts</b> connections that are specified as an URI.

       <b>dbname</b> The database name on the servers. Example:
                  dbname = customer_database

              The <b>dbname</b> setting is ignored for <b>hosts</b> connections that are specified as an URI.

              The  <b>dbname</b>  setting  is  required  with  Postfix 3.10 and later, when <b>hosts</b> specifies any non-URI
              connection; it is always required with earlier Postfix versions.

       <b>encoding</b>
              The encoding used by the database client. The default setting is:
                  encoding = UTF8

              Historically, the database client was hard coded to use LATIN1 in an attempt to disable  multibyte
              character support.

              This feature is available in Postfix 3.8 and later.

       <b>idle_interval</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>60)</b>
              The number of seconds after which an idle database connection will be closed.

              This feature is available in Postfix 3.9 and later.

       <b>retry_interval</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>60)</b>
              The number of seconds that a database connection will be skipped after an error.

              NOTE:  if  the  <b>hosts</b>  setting specifies one server, this client assumes that the target is a load
              balancer and will reconnect immediately after a single failure, instead of  failing  all  requests
              temporarily. With older versions of this client, specify the same server twice.

              This feature is available in Postfix 3.9 and later.

       <b>query</b>  The  SQL  query  template  used  to  search the database, where <b>%s</b> is a substitute for the address
              Postfix is trying to resolve, e.g.
                  query = SELECT replacement FROM aliases WHERE mailbox = '%s'

              This parameter supports the following '%' expansions:

              <b>%%</b>     This is replaced by a literal '%' character. (Postfix 2.2 and later)

              <b>%s</b>     This is replaced by the input key.  SQL quoting is used to make sure  that  the  input  key
                     does not add unexpected metacharacters.

              <b>%u</b>     When  the input key is an address of the form user@domain, <b>%u</b> is replaced by the SQL quoted
                     local part of the address.  Otherwise, <b>%u</b> is replaced by the entire search string.  If  the
                     localpart is empty, the query is suppressed and returns no results.

              <b>%d</b>     When  the input key is an address of the form user@domain, <b>%d</b> is replaced by the SQL quoted
                     domain part of the address.  Otherwise, the query is suppressed and returns no results.

              <b>%[SUD]</b> The  upper-case  equivalents  of  the  above  expansions  behave  in  the  <b>query</b>  parameter
                     identically  to  their  lower-case  counter-parts.   With  the <b>result_format</b> parameter (see
                     below), they expand the input key rather than the result value.

                     The above %S, %U and %D expansions are available with Postfix 2.2 and later

              <b>%[1-9]</b> The patterns %1, %2, ... %9 are replaced by the corresponding most significant component of
                     the input key's domain. If the input key is <u><a href="mailto:user@mail.example.com">user@mail.example.com</a></u>, then %1 is  <b>com</b>,  %2  is
                     <b>example</b>  and  %3  is  <b>mail</b>.  If the input key is unqualified or does not have enough domain
                     components to satisfy all the specified patterns, the query is suppressed  and  returns  no
                     results.

                     The above %1, ... %9 expansions are available with Postfix 2.2 and later

              The  <b>domain</b> parameter described below limits the input keys to addresses in matching domains. When
              the <b>domain</b> parameter  is  non-empty,  SQL  queries  for  unqualified  addresses  or  addresses  in
              non-matching domains are suppressed and return no results.

              The  precedence  of  this parameter has changed with Postfix 2.2, in prior releases the precedence
              was, from highest to lowest, <b>select_function</b>, <b>query</b>, <b>select_field</b>, ...

              With Postfix 2.2 the <b>query</b> parameter has highest precedence, see OBSOLETE QUERY INTERFACES below.

              NOTE: DO NOT put quotes around the <b>query</b> parameter.

       <b>result_format</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>%s</b>)
              Format template applied to result attributes. Most commonly used to append (or  prepend)  text  to
              the result. This parameter supports the following '%' expansions:

              <b>%%</b>     This is replaced by a literal '%' character.

              <b>%s</b>     This is replaced by the value of the result attribute. When result is empty it is skipped.

              <b>%u</b>     When  the  result  attribute value is an address of the form user@domain, <b>%u</b> is replaced by
                     the local part of the address. When the result has an empty localpart it is skipped.

              <b>%d</b>     When a result attribute value is an address of the form user@domain, <b>%d</b> is replaced by  the
                     domain part of the attribute value. When the result is unqualified it is skipped.

              <b>%[SUD1-9]</b>
                     The  upper-case  and decimal digit expansions interpolate the parts of the input key rather
                     than the result. Their behavior is identical to that described  with  <b>query</b>,  and  in  fact
                     because  the  input  key  is  known  in advance, queries whose key does not contain all the
                     information specified in the result template are suppressed and return no results.

              For example, using "result_format = smtp:[%s]" allows one to use a mailHost attribute as the basis
              of a <a href="../man5/transport.5.html">transport</a>(5) table. After applying the result format, multiple  values  are  concatenated  as
              comma  separated strings. The expansion_limit and parameter explained below allows one to restrict
              the number of values in the result, which is especially useful for maps that must return  at  most
              one value.

              The default value <b>%s</b> specifies that each result value should be used as is.

              This parameter is available with Postfix 2.2 and later.

              NOTE: DO NOT put quotes around the result format!

       <b>domain</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no</b> <b>domain</b> <b>list)</b>
              This  is  a  list of domain names, paths to files, or "type:table" databases. When specified, only
              fully qualified search keys with a *non-empty* localpart and a matching domain  are  eligible  for
              lookup:  'user'  lookups,  bare  domain  lookups and "@domain" lookups are not performed. This can
              significantly reduce the query load on the PostgreSQL server.
                  domain = postfix.org, hash:/etc/postfix/searchdomains

              It is best not to use SQL to store the domains eligible for SQL lookups.

              This parameter is available with Postfix 2.2 and later.

              NOTE: DO NOT define this parameter for  <a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a>(8)  aliases,  because  the  input  keys  are  always
              unqualified.

       <b>expansion_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
              A  limit  on  the total number of result elements returned (as a comma separated list) by a lookup
              against the map.  A setting of zero disables the limit. Lookups fail with a temporary error if the
              limit is exceeded.  Setting the limit to 1 ensures that lookups do not return multiple values.

</pre><h4><b>OBSOLETE</b> <b>MAIN.CF</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       For compatibility with other Postfix lookup tables, PostgreSQL parameters can also be defined in main.cf.
       In order to do that, specify as PostgreSQL source a name that doesn't begin with a slash or a  dot.   The
       PostgreSQL  parameters  will then be accessible as the name you've given the source in its definition, an
       underscore, and the name of the parameter.  For example, if the map is  specified  as  "pgsql:<u>pgsqlname</u>",
       the parameter "hosts" would be defined in main.cf as "<u>pgsqlname</u>_hosts".

       Note:  with this form, the passwords for the PostgreSQL sources are written in main.cf, which is normally
       world-readable.  Support for this form will be removed in a future Postfix version.

</pre><h4><b>OBSOLETE</b> <b>QUERY</b> <b>INTERFACES</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes query interfaces that are deprecated as of Postfix 2.2.  Please migrate to the new
       <b>query</b> interface as the old interfaces are slated to be phased out.

       <b>select_function</b>
              This parameter specifies a database function name. Example:
                  select_function = my_lookup_user_alias

              This is equivalent to:
                  query = SELECT my_lookup_user_alias('%s')

              This parameter overrides the legacy table-related fields (described below). With Postfix  versions
              prior  to  2.2,  it  also  overrides  the  <b>query</b>  parameter.  Starting with Postfix 2.2, the <b>query</b>
              parameter has highest precedence, and the <b>select_function</b> parameter is deprecated.

       The following parameters (with lower precedence than the <b>select_function</b> interface described  above)  can
       be used to build the SQL select statement as follows:

           SELECT [<b>select_field</b>]
           FROM [<b>table</b>]
           WHERE [<b>where_field</b>] = '%s'
                 [<b>additional_conditions</b>]

       The  specifier  %s is replaced with each lookup by the lookup key and is escaped so if it contains single
       quotes or other odd characters, it will not cause a parse error, or worse, a security problem.

       Starting with Postfix 2.2, this interface is obsoleted by the  more  general  <b>query</b>  interface  described
       above.  If  higher  precedence  the  <b>query</b> or <b>select_function</b> parameters described above are defined, the
       parameters described here are ignored.

       <b>select_field</b>
              The SQL "select" parameter. Example:
                  <b>select_field</b> = forw_addr

       <b>table</b>  The SQL "select .. from" table name. Example:
                  <b>table</b> = mxaliases

       <b>where_field</b>
              The SQL "select .. where" parameter. Example:
                  <b>where_field</b> = alias

       <b>additional_conditions</b>
              Additional conditions to the SQL query. Example:
                  <b>additional_conditions</b> = AND status = 'paid'
