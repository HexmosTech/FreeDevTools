</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       reporting - Grid Engine reporting file format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  Grid  Engine  system writes a reporting file <u>$SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/reporting</u> if <b>reporting=true</b> is
       specified in the <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5) <b>reporting_params</b>.  This occurs intervals of the <b>flush_time</b> specified in  the
       same  place.   The  reporting file contains data that can be used for accounting, monitoring and analysis
       purposes.  It contains information about the cluster (hosts, queues,  load  values,  consumables,  etc.),
       about  the  jobs  running in the cluster and about sharetree configuration and usage.  All information is
       time-related and events are dumped to the reporting file in a configurable  interval.   It  allows  "real
       time" monitoring of the cluster status as well as historical analysis.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The  reporting  file  is  an  ASCII  file.  Each line contains one record, and the fields of a record are
       separated by a delimiter (:).  The reporting file contains records of different type.  Each  record  type
       has a specific record structure.

       The first two fields are common to all reporting records:

       <b>time</b>   The  time  when  the record was created.  All time values described here are the number of seconds
              since the Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).

       <b>record</b> <b>type</b>
              Type of the accounting record.

       The different types of records and their structure are described below,  eliding  the  leading  <b>time</b>  and
       <b>record</b> <b>type</b> fields in each case.

   <b>new_job</b>
       The  new_job record is written whenever a new job enters the system (usually by a submission command). It
       has the following fields:

       <b>submission_time</b>
              Time when the job was submitted.

       <b>job_number</b>
              The job number.

       <b>task_number</b>
              The array task id. Always has the value -1 for  new_job  records  (as  array  tasks  haven't  been
              created at that stage).

       <b>pe_taskid</b>
              The task id of parallel tasks. Always has the value "none" for new_job records.

       <b>job_name</b>
              The job name (from <b>-N</b> submission option).

       <b>owner</b>  The job owner.

       <b>group</b>  The Unix group of the job owner.

       <b>project</b>
              The project the job is running in.

       <b>department</b>
              The department the job owner is in.

       <b>account</b>
              The account string specified for the job (from the <b>-A</b> submission option).

       <b>priority</b>
              The job priority (from the <b>-p</b> submission option).

   <b>job_log</b>
       If  <b>joblog=true</b>  is specified in the <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5) <b>reporting_params</b>, a job_log record is written whenever a
       job, an array task or a PE task changes status. A status change can be the  transition  from  pending  to
       running,  but  can  also  be  triggered  by user actions, like suspension of a job.  It has the following
       fields:

       <b>event_time</b>
              Time when the event was generated.

       <b>event</b>  A one word description of the event.

       <b>job_number</b>
              The job number.

       <b>task_number</b>
              The PE task id. Always has the value -1 for  new_job  records  (as  parallel  tasks  haven't  been
              created at that stage).

       <b>pe_taskid</b>
              The task id of parallel tasks. Always has the value "none" for new_job records.

       <b>state</b>  The state of the job after the event was processed.

       <b>user</b>   The  user  who  initiated  the  event (or special usernames "qmaster", "scheduler" and "execd" for
              actions of the system itself like scheduling jobs, executing jobs etc.).

       <b>host</b>   The host from which the action was initiated (e.g. the submit host, the qmaster host, etc.).

       <b>state_time</b>
              Reserved field for later use.

       <b>submission_time</b>
              Time when the job was submitted.

       <b>job_name</b>
              The job name (from the <b>-N</b> submission option).

       <b>owner</b>  The job owner.

       <b>group</b>  The Unix group of the job owner.

       <b>project</b>
              The project the job is running in.

       <b>department</b>
              The department the job owner is in.

       <b>account</b>
              The account string specified for the job (from the <b>-A</b> submission option).

       <b>priority</b>
              The job priority (from the <b>-p</b> submission option).

       <b>message</b>
              A message describing the reported action.

   <b>acct</b>
       Records of type acct are accounting records. Normally, they are written whenever a  job,  a  task  of  an
       array  job,  or  a task of a parallel job terminates. However, for long running jobs an intermediate acct
       record is created once a day after midnight. This results in multiple accounting records for a particular
       job and allows for fine-grained resource usage monitoring over time.

       Accounting records have the structure described in <u><a href="../man5/accounting.5.html">accounting</a></u>(5), with the addition of leading  time  and
       type fields (which are not used in the accounting file).

   <b>queue</b>
       Records  of  type  queue  contain state information for queues (queue instances).  A queue record has the
       following fields:

       <b>qname</b>  The cluster queue name.

       <b>hostname</b>
              The hostname of a specific queue instance.

       <b>report_time</b>
              The time when a state change was triggered.

       <b>state</b>  The new queue state.  The possible states are single-letter values, as reported by  <u><a href="../man1/qhost.1.html">qhost</a></u>(1)  with
              the <b>-q</b> option.

   <b>queue_consumable</b>
       A  queue_consumable  record contains information about queue consumable values in addition to queue state
       information:

       <b>qname</b>  The cluster queue name.

       <b>hostname</b>
              The hostname of a specific queue instance.

       <b>report_time</b>
              The time when a state change was triggered.

       <b>state</b>  The new queue state.

       <b>consumables</b>
              Description of consumable values. Information about multiple consumables is separated by space.  A
              consumable description has the format <u>name</u>=<u>actual_value</u>=<u>configured_value</u>.

       Consumables are only logged if <b>log_consumables=true</b> is specified in the <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5) <b>reporting_params</b>,  or
       the consumable is specified in the local or global <u><a href="../man5/host_conf.5.html">host_conf</a></u>(5) <b>report_variables</b>.

   <b>host</b>
       A  host  record  contains  information  about  hosts  and  host  load  values.  It contains the following
       information:

       <b>hostname</b>
              The name of the host.

       <b>report_time</b>
              The time when the reported information was generated.

       <b>state</b>  The new host state.  Currently, Grid Engine doesn't track a host state; the field is reserved  for
              future use. Always contains the value X.

       <b>load</b> <b>values</b>
              Description  of load values. Information about multiple load values is separated by space.  A load
              value description has the format <u>name</u>=<u>actual_value</u>.

   <b>host_consumable</b>
       A host_consumable record contains information about hosts and host consumables.   Host  consumables  can,
       for example, be licenses.  It contains the following information:

       <b>hostname</b>
              The name of the host.

       <b>report_time</b>
              The time when the reported information was generated.

       <b>state</b>  The  new host state.  Currently, Grid Engine doesn't track a host state; the field is reserved for
              future use. Always contains the value X.

       <b>consumables</b>
              Description of consumable values. Information about multiple consumables is separated by space.  A
              consumable description has the format <u>name</u>=<u>actual_value</u>=<u>configured_value</u>.

       Consumables are only logged if <b>log_consumables=true</b> is specified in the <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5) <b>reporting_params</b>,  or
       the consumable is specified in the local or global <u><a href="../man5/host_conf.5.html">host_conf</a></u>(5) <b>report_variables</b>.

   <b>sharelog</b>
       The Grid Engine qmaster can dump information about sharetree configuration and use to the reporting file.
       The  <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5)  <b>reporting_params</b>  can  specify  <b>sharelog</b>,  which  sets  an  interval in which sharetree
       information will be dumped.  It is set in the format HH:MM:SS. A value of 00:00:00 configures qmaster not
       to dump sharetree information. Intervals of several minutes up to hours  are  sensible  values  for  this
       parameter.  The record contains the following fields

       <b>current</b> <b>time</b>
