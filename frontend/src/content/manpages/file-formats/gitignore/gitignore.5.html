</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gitignore - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore, $GIT_DIR/info/exclude, .gitignore

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A <b>gitignore</b> file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by
       Git are not affected; see the NOTES below for details.

       Each line in a <b>gitignore</b> file specifies a pattern. When deciding whether to ignore a path, Git normally
       checks <b>gitignore</b> patterns from multiple sources, with the following order of precedence, from highest to
       lowest (within one level of precedence, the last matching pattern decides the outcome):

       •   Patterns read from the command line for those commands that support them.

       •   Patterns read from a <b>.gitignore</b> file in the same directory as the path, or in any parent directory
           (up to the top-level of the working tree), with patterns in the higher level files being overridden
           by those in lower level files down to the directory containing the file. These patterns match
           relative to the location of the <b>.gitignore</b> file. A project normally includes such <b>.gitignore</b> files in
           its repository, containing patterns for files generated as part of the project build.

       •   Patterns read from <b>$GIT_DIR/info/exclude</b>.

       •   Patterns read from the file specified by the configuration variable <b>core.excludesFile</b>.

       Which file to place a pattern in depends on how the pattern is meant to be used.

       •   Patterns which should be version-controlled and distributed to other repositories via clone (i.e.,
           files that all developers will want to ignore) should go into a <b>.gitignore</b> file.

       •   Patterns which are specific to a particular repository but which do not need to be shared with other
           related repositories (e.g., auxiliary files that live inside the repository but are specific to one
           user’s workflow) should go into the <b>$GIT_DIR/info/exclude</b> file.

       •   Patterns which a user wants Git to ignore in all situations (e.g., backup or temporary files
           generated by the user’s editor of choice) generally go into a file specified by <b>core.excludesFile</b> in
           the user’s <b><a href="file:~/.gitconfig">~/.gitconfig</a></b>. Its default value is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is
           either not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/ignore is used instead.

       The underlying Git plumbing tools, such as <u>git</u> <u>ls-files</u> and <u>git</u> <u>read-tree</u>, read <b>gitignore</b> patterns
       specified by command-line options, or from files specified by command-line options. Higher-level Git
       tools, such as <u>git</u> <u>status</u> and <u>git</u> <u>add</u>, use patterns from the sources specified above.

</pre><h4><b>PATTERN</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       •   A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for readability.

       •   A line starting with # serves as a comment. Put a backslash ("<b>\</b>") in front of the first hash for
           patterns that begin with a hash.

       •   Trailing spaces are ignored unless they are quoted with backslash ("<b>\</b>").

       •   An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern
           will become included again. It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that
           file is excluded. Git doesn’t list excluded directories for performance reasons, so any patterns on
           contained files have no effect, no matter where they are defined. Put a backslash ("<b>\</b>") in front of
           the first "!" for patterns that begin with a literal "!", for example, "<b>\</b>!important!.txt".

       •   The slash "<b>/</b>" is used as the directory separator. Separators may occur at the beginning, middle or
           end of the <b>.gitignore</b> search pattern.

       •   If there is a separator at the beginning or middle (or both) of the pattern, then the pattern is
           relative to the directory level of the particular <b>.gitignore</b> file itself. Otherwise the pattern may
           also match at any level below the <b>.gitignore</b> level.

       •   If there is a separator at the end of the pattern then the pattern will only match directories,
           otherwise the pattern can match both files and directories.

       •   For example, a pattern <b>doc/frotz/</b> matches <b>doc/frotz</b> directory, but not <b>a/doc/frotz</b> directory; however
           <b>frotz/</b> matches <b>frotz</b> and <b>a/frotz</b> that is a directory (all paths are relative from the <b>.gitignore</b>
           file).

       •   An asterisk "<b>*</b>" matches anything except a slash. The character "?" matches any one character except
           "<b>/</b>". The range notation, e.g. [<b>a-zA-Z</b>], can be used to match one of the characters in a range. See
           <a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a>(3) and the FNM_PATHNAME flag for a more detailed description.

       Two consecutive asterisks ("<b>**</b>") in patterns matched against full pathname may have special meaning:

       •   A leading "<b>**</b>" followed by a slash means match in all directories. For example, "<b>**/foo</b>" matches file
           or directory "<b>foo</b>" anywhere, the same as pattern "<b>foo</b>". "<b>**/foo/bar</b>" matches file or directory "<b>bar</b>"
           anywhere that is directly under directory "<b>foo</b>".

       •   A trailing "<b>/**</b>" matches everything inside. For example, "<b>abc/**</b>" matches all files inside directory
           "<b>abc</b>", relative to the location of the <b>.gitignore</b> file, with infinite depth.

       •   A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or more directories. For
           example, "<b>a/**/b</b>" matches "<b>a/b</b>", "<b>a/x/b</b>", "<b>a/x/y/b</b>" and so on.

       •   Other consecutive asterisks are considered regular asterisks and will match according to the previous
           rules.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The optional configuration variable <b>core.excludesFile</b> indicates a path to a file containing patterns of
       file names to exclude, similar to <b>$GIT_DIR/info/exclude</b>. Patterns in the exclude file are used in
       addition to those in <b>$GIT_DIR/info/exclude</b>.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The purpose of gitignore files is to ensure that certain files not tracked by Git remain untracked.

       To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked, use <u>git</u> <u>rm</u> <u>--cached</u> to remove the file from the index.
       The filename can then be added to the <b>.gitignore</b> file to stop the file from being reintroduced in later
       commits.

       Git does not follow symbolic links when accessing a <b>.gitignore</b> file in the working tree. This keeps
       behavior consistent when the file is accessed from the index or a tree versus from the filesystem.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       •   The pattern <b>hello.*</b>  matches any file or directory whose name begins with <b>hello.</b>. If one wants to
           restrict this only to the directory and not in its subdirectories, one can prepend the pattern with a
           slash, i.e.  <b>/hello.*</b>; the pattern now matches <b>hello.txt</b>, <b>hello.c</b> but not <b>a/hello.java</b>.

       •   The pattern <b>foo/</b> will match a directory <b>foo</b> and paths underneath it, but will not match a regular
           file or a symbolic link <b>foo</b> (this is consistent with the way how pathspec works in general in Git)

       •   The pattern <b>doc/frotz</b> and <b>/doc/frotz</b> have the same effect in any <b>.gitignore</b> file. In other words, a
           leading slash is not relevant if there is already a middle slash in the pattern.

       •   The pattern <b>foo/*</b>, matches <b>foo/test.json</b> (a regular file), <b>foo/bar</b> (a directory), but it does not
           match <b>foo/bar/hello.c</b> (a regular file), as the asterisk in the pattern does not match <b>bar/hello.c</b>
           which has a slash in it.

               $ git status
               [...]
               # Untracked files:
               [...]
               #       Documentation/foo.html
               #       Documentation/gitignore.html
               #       file.o
               #       lib.a
               #       src/internal.o
               [...]
               $ cat .git/info/exclude
               # ignore objects and archives, anywhere in the tree.
               *.[oa]
               $ cat Documentation/.gitignore
               # ignore generated html files,
               *.html
               # except foo.html which is maintained by hand
               !foo.html
               $ git status
               [...]
               # Untracked files:
               [...]
               #       Documentation/foo.html
               [...]

       Another example:

               $ cat .gitignore
               vmlinux*
               $ ls arch/foo/kernel/vm*
               arch/foo/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S
               $ echo '!/vmlinux*' &gt;arch/foo/kernel/.gitignore

       The second .gitignore prevents Git from ignoring <b>arch/foo/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S</b>.

       Example to exclude everything except a specific directory <b>foo/bar</b> (note the <b>/*</b> - without the slash, the
       wildcard would also exclude everything within <b>foo/bar</b>):

               $ cat .gitignore
               # exclude everything except directory foo/bar
               /*
               !/foo
               /foo/*
               !/foo/bar
