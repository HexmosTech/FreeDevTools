</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       autolog.conf - Configuration file for the autolog command

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration  file consists of multiple lines, each of which describes a class of processes subject
       (or not subject) to a certain auto logout procedure.  A line consists of any number of  switches.   Value
       switches are of the form: "name=value".  Boolean switches are of the form: "name" or "noname".

       Using these switches, you can define a username, a group, and a tty line.  These descriptions can contain
       wildcard  characters  (regular  expressions).  You can also define an idle time, a grace period and a few
       other options.  When reading the configuration file, the program creates a record for each  configuration
       line.   A  value  is assigned to each variable in the record regardless of whether or not you specify one
       explicitly.  Values for missing variables are provided by defaults which  are  compiled  in  and  can  be
       modified from the command line.

       If  no  entries  are found matching a given process, that process will be spared from an untimely demise.
       Therefore, it is a good idea to always have a "cleanup" line at the end  of  the  configuration  file  to
       catch  anything  that  might  have been missed by the more explicit definitions.  Since the default name,
       group, and line are all ".+", a simple line like:

               idle=30

       will do.  Actually, any one switch can be specified on the line and all the others will get  the  default
       values.

       If  no  configuration file is found, the program will create a single entry which has all values set from
       the defaults.  This entry will match any process on any port (name=.+ line=.+ group=.+).  Therefore,  the
       default action is to kill all processes.

</pre><h4><b>ENTRIES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>name=</b>  A regular expression specifying which username(s) to match.

       <b>group=</b> A regular expression specifying which group(s) to match.

       <b>line=</b>  A  regular expression specifying which tty line(s) to match.  Omit the "<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>" part of the special
              name.

       <b>idle=</b>  An integer specifying the number of  --minutes--  of  idle  (or  connect)  time  to  allow  before
              beginning automatic logoff.  An idle time of 0 exempts the process from automatic logoff.

       <b>grace=</b> An integer specifying the number of --seconds-- from the initial warning to killing the process.

       <b>ban=</b>   An  integer  specifying the number of --minutes-- from killing the process to the moment, the user
              may login again. (after exceeding his session).

       <b>hard</b>   A boolean value indicating total connect time will be considered rather than idle time.

       <b>mail</b>   A boolean value indicating that mail will be sent to the user explaining that he was killed.

       <b>clear</b>  A boolean value indicating that the screen will be cleared before a warning message is sent.

       <b>warn</b>   A boolean value indicating that a warning message will be sent at the  beginning  of  the  "grace"
              period.

       <b>log</b>    A boolean value indicating that activities will be logged to the logfile (if it exists).

</pre><h4><b>FURTHER</b> <b>ENTRIES</b></h4><pre>
       There  is  another  group  of entries, which allows one to set some general options. Each of them takes a
       whole line.  Don't mix them with the other entries from before.

       <b>nolostkill</b>
              A boolean value indicating whether lost processes should be killed.  If there is  a  process  with
              uid  between  500  and  60000  and  the  owner is not logged in, it is assumed as lost and will be
              killed.

       <b>ps=command</b>
              on some strange or old systems the ps-command has different parameters.  This makes it possible to
              set a completely different command. It is only important, that this command delivers  one  heading
              line and then lines with usernames and process-ids (pid). e.g.:  ps=ps aux

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
               name=root line=tty[1-7] idle=0
               name=guest idle=5 grace=60 nomail hard warn
               group=lynx-.* idle=10 grace=60 clear
               idle=60 grace=30
