</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mh-tailor, mts.conf - mail transport configuration for nmh message handler

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  file <u>/etc/nmh/mts.conf</u> defines run-time options for those <b>nmh</b> programs which interact (in some form)
       with the message transport system.  At present,  these  (user)  programs  are:  <b>ap</b>,  <b>inc</b>,  <b>msgchk</b>,  <b>post</b>,
       <b>rcvdist</b>, and <b>rcvpack</b>.

       Each  option  should  be given on a single line.  Blank lines and lines which begin with `#' are ignored.
       The options available along with default values and a description of their meanings are listed below:

       <b>mts</b>:
            The mail transport method to use.  The three acceptable options are <b>smtp</b>  (which  is  the  default),
            <b>sendmail/smtp</b>, and <b>sendmail/pipe</b>.

            If  you  use  <b>smtp</b>,  this will enable a direct SMTP interface in <b>nmh</b>.  When sending mail, instead of
            passing the message to the mail transport agent, <b>post</b> will open a socket connection to the mail port
            on the machine specified in the <b>servers</b> entry.

            If you use <b>sendmail/smtp</b>, then <b>post</b> will send messages by forking a local copy of <b>sendmail</b>.  It will
            still speak SMTP with this local copy of <b>sendmail</b>.  For backward compatibility, <b>sendmail/smtp</b> can be
            abbreviated to <b>sendmail</b>.

            The third alternative, <b>sendmail/pipe</b>, also forks a local copy of  <b>sendmail</b>  but  feeds  the  message
            directly  to it, using <b>sendmail</b> <b>-t</b>.  This replaces the old, undocumented <b>spost</b> mechanism and retains
            some of its limitations, such as lack of support for the “Dcc:” header field, as  described  in  the
            <b>send</b> and <b>post</b> manual pages.

       <b>localname</b>:
            The  hostname  <b>nmh</b>  considers local.  It should typically be a fully qualified hostname.  If this is
            not set, depending on the version of Unix you're running, <b>nmh</b> will query the system for  this  value
            (e.g. uname, gethostname, etc.), and attempt to fully qualify this value.

            If you are using POP to retrieve new messages, you may want to set this value to the name of the POP
            server, so that outgoing messages appear to have originated on the POP server.

       <b>localdomain</b>:
            If this is set, a `.' followed by this string will be appended to your hostname.

            This  should  only  be  needed,  if  for  some  reason <b>nmh</b> is not able to fully qualify the hostname
            returned by the system (e.g. uname, gethostname, etc.).

       <b>clientname</b>:
            This option specifies the host name that <b>nmh</b> will give in the SMTP <b>HELO</b>  (and  <b>EHLO</b>)  command,  when
            posting  mail.   If  not  set,  the  default  is  to use the host name that <b>nmh</b> considers local (see
            <b>localname</b> above).  If this option is set, but empty, no <b>HELO</b> command will be given.

            Although the <b>HELO</b> command is required by RFC 821, many  SMTP  servers  do  not  require  it.   Early
            versions  of  <u>SendMail</u> will fail if the hostname given in the <b>HELO</b> command is the local host.  Later
            versions of <u>SendMail</u> will complain if you omit the <b>HELO</b> command.  If you run <u>SendMail</u>, find out what
            your system expects and set this field if needed.

       <b>systemname</b>:
            This option is only used for UUCP mail.  It specifies the  name  of  the  local  host  in  the  UUCP
            “domain”.   If  not  set, depending on the version of Unix you're running, <b>nmh</b> will query the system
            for this value.  This has no equivalent in the <b>nmh</b> configuration file.

       <b>mmdfldir</b>: <a href="file:/var/mail">/var/mail</a>
            The directory where mail drops are kept.  If  this  option  is  set,  but  empty,  the  user's  home
            directory is used.  This overrides the default value chosen at the time of compilation.

       <b>mmdflfil</b>:
            The  name  of  the mail drop file in the directory where mail drops are kept.  If this is empty, the
            user's login name is used.  This overrides the default value (which is empty).

       <b>spoollocking</b>: fcntl
            The locking algorithm to use when opening the mail drop.  Can be any one of the following:

                 fcntl dot flock lockf

       <b>maildelivery</b>: /usr/lib/mh/maildelivery
            The name of the system-wide default <u>maildelivery</u> file.  See <u><a href="../man1/slocal.1.html">slocal</a></u>(1) for the details.

   <b>SMTP</b> <b>support</b>
       This option is only available if you set <b>mts</b> to <b>smtp</b>.

       <b>servers</b>: localhost
            A single hostname to be used when performing mail submission via SMTP.   Previous  versions  of  <b>nmh</b>
            supported  multiple  hostnames  for  <b>servers</b>,  but the current version of <b>nmh</b> only supports a single
            entry (the name is kept for backwards compatibility  reasons).   This  can  be  overridden  via  the
            <b>-server</b>  switch  to  <u><a href="../man1/send.1.html">send</a></u>(1).   It  is not possible to change the mail submission port number in the
            <b>servers</b> entry; see the <b>-port</b> switch to <u><a href="../man1/send.1.html">send</a></u>(1) for this functionality.

   <b>SendMail</b>
       This option is only available if you set <b>mts</b> to <b>sendmail/smtp</b> or <b>sendmail/pipe</b>.

       <b>sendmail</b>: /usr/sbin/sendmail
            The pathname to the <b>sendmail</b> program.

   <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Protocol</b>
       <b>pophost</b>:
            The name of the default POP service host.  If this is not set, then <b>nmh</b> looks in the  standard  mail
            drop areas for waiting mail, otherwise the named POP service host is consulted.

   <b>File</b> <b>Locking</b>
       A  few  words  on  locking:  <b>nmh</b>  has  two  main  uses  for  locking:  locking the mail spool during mail
       incorporation, and locking metadata files (sequence files, the context) during  updates.   These  locking
       methods can be configured separately from each other.

       For  locking the mail spool, the <b>spoollocking</b> entry in <u><a href="../man5/mh-tailor.5.html">mh-tailor</a></u>(5) will control the locking algorithm to
       use when <b>inc</b> incorporates mail from the spool file.  If no  entry  is  given,  a  default  based  on  the
       operating system type will be chosen.

       For  locking  all other files, the <b>datalocking</b> entry in <u><a href="../man5/mh-profile.5.html">mh-profile</a></u>(5) controls the locking algorithm used
       for all other file access.  If no entry is given, the <b>fcntl</b> lock method will be chosen.

       If you do not wish to use kernel-based locking, <u>dot</u>  locking  is  an  option  available.   If  “--enable-
       lockdir=directory”  is not specified at build time, lock files will be created in the directory where the
       file being locked resides.  Otherwise,  lock  files  will  be  created  in  the  directory  specified  by
       “--enable-lockdir”.

       Prior to installing <b>nmh</b>, you should see how locking is done at your site, and set the appropriate values.

       /etc/nmh/mts.conf   nmh mts configuration file

</pre><h4><b>PROFILE</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b></h4><pre>
       None

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man8/mh-mts.8.html">mh-mts</a></u>(8), <u><a href="../man8/post.8.html">post</a></u>(8) <u><a href="../man8/send.8.html">send</a></u>(8)

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULTS</b></h4><pre>
       As  listed  above.   The  path of the mail transport configuration file can be changed with the MHMTSCONF
       environment variable and augmented with the MHMTSUSERCONF environment variable, see <u><a href="../man5/mh-profile.5.html">mh-profile</a></u>(5).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Failure to open any mail transport configuration file is silently ignored.  Therefore, it's best to avoid
       dynamic creation of such a file with the intent of use via the  MHMTSCONF  or  MHMTSUSERCONF  environment
       variables.  If such use is necessary, the ability to successfully open the file should first be verified.
