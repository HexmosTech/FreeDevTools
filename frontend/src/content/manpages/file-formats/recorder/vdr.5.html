</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       vdr_files - the Video Disk Recorder Files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This page describes the formats of the various files <b>vdr</b> uses to store configuration data and recordings.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CHANNELS</b>
       The file <u>channels.conf</u> contains the channel configuration.  Each line defines either a <b>group</b> <b>delimiter</b> or
       a <b>channel</b>.

       A  <b>group</b> <b>delimiter</b> is a line starting with a ':' as the very first character, followed by arbitrary text.
       Example:

       <b>:First</b> <b>group</b>

       Group delimiters may also be used to specify the number of the next channel.  To do this,  the  character
       '@' and a number must immediately follow the ':', as in

       <b>:@201</b> <b>First</b> <b>group</b>

       The  given  number  must  be  larger  than  the  number of any previous channel (otherwise it is silently
       ignored).

       A group delimiter can also be used to just set the next channel's number, without an  explicit  delimiter
       text, as in

       <b>:@201</b>

       Such a delimiter will not appear in the Channels menu.

       A  <b>channel</b>  <b>definition</b>  is  a  line  with channel data, where the fields are separated by ':' characters.
       Example:

       <b>RTL</b> <b>Television,RTL;RTL</b> <b>World:12187:hC34M2O0S0:S19.2E:27500:163=2:104=deu;106=deu:105:0:12003:1:1089:0</b>

       The line number of a channel definition (not counting group separators, and based on a possible  previous
       '@...' parameter) defines the channel's number in OSD menus and the <u>timers.conf</u> file.

       The fields in a channel definition have the following meaning (from left to right):

       <b>Name</b>   The channel's name (if the name originally contains a ':' character it has to be replaced by '|').
              Some TV stations provide a way of deriving a "short name" from the channel name, which can be used
              in  situations  where  there  is  not  much  space  for displaying a long name. If a short name is
              available for this channel, it follows the full name and is delimited by a comma, as in

              <b>RTL</b> <b>Television,RTL:...</b>

              If the short name itself would contain a comma, it is replaced with a '.'.  Note  that  some  long
              channel names may contain a comma, so the delimiting comma is always the rightmost one.

              If  present,  the  name  of  the  service  provider  or "bouquet" is appended to the channel name,
              separated by a semicolon, as in

              <b>RTL</b> <b>Television,RTL;RTL</b> <b>World:...</b>

       <b>Frequency</b>
              The transponder frequency (as an integer). For DVB-S this value is in MHz. For DVB-C and DVB-T  it
              can  be given either in MHz, kHz or Hz (the actual value given will be multiplied by 1000 until it
              is larger than 1000000).

       <b>Parameters</b>
              Various parameters, depending on whether this is a DVB-S, DVB-C or DVB-T channel.  Each  parameter
              consist  of  a  key character, followed by an integer number that represents the actual setting of
              that parameter. The valid key characters, their meaning (and allowed values) are

              <b>Code</b> <b>rate</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority:</b> Forward Error Correction (FEC) of the high  priority  stream  (DVB-T/DVB-
              T2).   For  DVB-S/DVB-S2  this parameter specifies the inner FEC scheme.  12 = 1/2, 23 = 2/3, 34 =
              3/4, ...

              <b>Code</b> <b>rate</b> <b>low</b> <b>priority:</b> Forward Error Correction (FEC) of the low  priority  stream  (DVB-T/DVB-T2
              only).  If no hierarchy is used, set to 0.

              <b>Guard</b> <b>interval:</b> The guard interval value (DVB-T only): 4 = 1/4, 8 = 1/8, 16 = 1/16, 32 = 1/32, 128
              = 1/128, 19128 = 19/128, 19256 = 19/256.

              <b>Inversion:</b>  Specifies  whether  the  DVB frontend needs spectral inversion (DVB-T and DVB-C only).
              This is frontend specific, if in doubt, omit.

              <b>Modulation:</b> Specifies the modulation/constellation of the channel as follows:

              <b>64</b>    QAM64 (DVB-C, DVB-T, DVB-T2, ISDB-T)
              <b>128</b>   QAM128 (DVB-C)
              <b>256</b>   QAM256 (DVB-C, DVB-T2)

              <b>Pilot</b> <b>mode:</b> The pilot mode (0 = "off", 1 = "on", 999 = "auto") for DVB-S2 multiplex (DVB-S2 only).

              <b>Rolloff:</b> The Nyquist filter rolloff factor for DVB-S (<b>35</b>) and DVB-S2 (<b>35</b>, 25, 20), 35 = 0.35, 25 =
              0.25, 20 = 0.20, DVB-S/DVB-S2 default value is 0.35

              <b>Stream</b> <b>id:</b> Input Stream Identifier (ISI) (<b>0</b>-255) for DVB-S2 multiplex or Physical Layer Pipe (PLP)
              id (<b>0</b>-255) for DVB-T2 multiplex (DVB-S2/DVB-T2 only, with devices that support "multi streaming").

              <b>T2</b> <b>System</b> <b>id:</b> Unique identifier (<b>0</b>-65535) of T2 system within the DVB network (DVB-T2).

              <b>Transmission</b> <b>mode:</b> Number of DVB-T OFDM carriers, 32 = 32k, 16 = 16k, 8 = 8k, 4 = 4k, 2 = 2k, 1  =
              1k. If in doubt, try 8k.

              <b>SISO/MISO</b>  <b>mode:</b> Specifies the Single-Input/Multiple-Input Single-Output mode (<b>0</b> = SISO, 1 = MISO)
              (DVB-T2).

              <b>Hierarchy:</b> If set to 1, this transponder uses two streams, high priority and low priority.  If  in
              doubt, try 0 (off). (DVB-T/DVB-T2 only).

              <b>Delivery</b>  <b>System:</b>  The  delivery  system  (0  =  "first  generation"  (DVB-S/DVB-T),  1  = "second
              generation" (DVB-S2/DVB-T2).

              <b>Polarization:</b> Satellite antenna polarization.  H = horizontal, V = vertical, R = circular right, L
              = circular left.

              The polarization parameters have no integer numbers following them. This is for compatibility with
              files from older versions and also to keep the DVB-S entries as simple as possible.

              The special value <b>999</b> is used for "automatic", which means the driver will automatically determine
              the proper value (if possible).

              An example of a parameter field for a DVB-T channel might look like this: <b>B8C23D12G8M16T8Y0S0</b>

              An example of a parameter field for a DVB-T2 channel might look like this: <b>B8C23D12G8M16T8Y0P0S1</b>

              An example of a parameter field for a DVB-C channel might look like this: <b>C0M64</b>

              An example of a parameter field for a DVB-S channel might look like this: <b>HC56M2O35S0</b>

              An example of a parameter field for a DVB-S2 channel might look like this: <b>HC910M2O35S1</b>

              Plugins that implement devices that need their own set  of  parameters  may  store  those  in  the
              parameters  string  in  arbitrary  format  (not  necessarily  the "character/number" format listed
              above). The only condition is that the string may not contain colons (':') or newline characters.

       <b>Source</b> The signal source of this channel, as defined in the file <u>sources.conf</u>.

       <b>Srate</b>  The symbol rate of this channel (DVB-S and DVB-C only).

       <b>VPID</b>   The video PID (set to '0' for radio channels).  If this  channel  uses  a  separate  PCR  PID,  it
              follows the VPID, separated by a plus sign, as in

              <b>...:164+17:...</b>

              If  this  channel  has  a  video mode other than 0, the mode follows the pids, separated by an '='
              sign, as in

              <b>...:164+17=27:...</b>

       <b>APID</b>   The audio PID (either one number, or several, separated by commas).  If this channel also  carries
              Dolby Digital sound, the Dolby PIDs follow the audio PIDs, separated by a semicolon, as in

              <b>...:101,102;103,104:...</b>

              If  certain  audio  PIDs  broadcast  in  specific  languages,  the language codes for these can be
              appended to the individual audio or Dolby PID, separated by an '=' sign, as in

              <b>...:101=deu,102=eng;103=deu,104=eng:...</b>

              Some channels broadcast two different languages in the two stereo channels, which can be indicated
              by adding a second language code, delimited by a '+' sign, as in

              <b>...:101=deu,102=eng+spa;103=deu,104=eng:...</b>

              The audio type is appended with a separating '@' character, as in

              <b>...:101=deu@4,102=eng+spa@4,105=@4:...</b>

              Note that if there is no language code, there still is the separating '=' if  there  is  an  audio
              type.

       <b>TPID</b>   The  teletext PID.  If this channel also carries DVB subtitles, the DVB subtitling PIDs follow the
              teletext PID, separated by a semicolon, as in

              <b>...:201;2001,2002:...</b>

              If certain subtitling PIDs broadcast in specific languages, the language codes for  these  can  be
              appended to the individual subtitling PID, separated by an '=' sign, as in

              <b>...:201;2001=deu,2002=eng:...</b>

       <b>Conditional</b> <b>access</b>
              A hexadecimal integer defining how this channel can be accessed:
              <b>0000</b>          Free To Air
              <b>0001...000F</b>   explicitly requires the device with the given number
              <b>0010...00FF</b>   reserved for user defined assignments
              <b>0100...FFFF</b>   specific decryption methods as broadcast in the data stream
              Values  in  the  range 0001...00FF will not be overwritten, all other values will be automatically
              replaced by the actual CA system identifiers received from the data stream. If there is more  than
              one CA system id broadcast, they will be separated by commas, as in

              <b>...:1702,1722,1801:...</b>

              The  values  are in hex because that's the way they are defined in the "ETR 162" document. Leading
              zeros may be omitted.

       <b>SID</b>    The Service ID of this channel.

       <b>NID</b>    The Network ID of this channel.

       <b>TID</b>    The Transport stream ID of this channel.

       <b>RID</b>    The Radio ID of this channel (typically 0, may be used to distinguish channels where NID, TID  and
              SID are all equal).

       A  particular  channel  can  be  uniquely identified by its <b>channel</b> <b>ID</b>, which is a string that looks like
       this:

       <b>S19.2E-1-1089-12003-0</b>

       The components of this string are the <b>Source</b> (S19.2E), <b>NID</b> (1), <b>TID</b> (1089), <b>SID</b> (12003) and  <b>RID</b>  (0)  as
       defined  above.   The  last part can be omitted if it is <b>0</b>, so the above example could also be written as
       S19.2E-1-1089-12003).
       The <b>channel</b> <b>ID</b> is used in the <u>timers.conf</u> and <u>epg.data</u> files to properly identify the channels.

       If a channel has both <b>NID</b> and <b>TID</b> set to 0, the <b>channel</b> <b>ID</b> will use the <b>Frequency</b> instead of the <b>TID</b>. For
       satellite channels an additional offset of 100000, 200000, 300000 or 400000  is  added  to  that  number,
       depending  on the <b>Polarization</b> (<b>H</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>L</b> or <b>R</b>, respectively). This is necessary because on some satellites
       the same frequency is used for two different transponders, with opposite polarization.

   <b>TIMERS</b>
       The file <u>timers.conf</u> contains the timer setup.  Each line contains one timer definition, with  individual
       fields separated by ':' characters. Example:

       <b>1:10:-T-----:2058:2150:50:5:Quarks</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Co:</b>

       The fields in a timer definition have the following meaning (from left to right):

       <b>Flags</b>  The individual bits in this field have the following meaning:
              <b>0x0001</b>   the timer is active (and will record if it hits)
              <b>0x0002</b>   this is an instant recording timer
              <b>0x0004</b>   this timer uses VPS
              <b>0x0008</b>   this timer is currently recording (may only be up-to-date with SVDRP)
              <b>0x0010</b>   this timer was spawned from a pattern timer
              <b>0x0020</b>   this timer will store the recording's name in donerecs.data

              All other bits are reserved for future use.

       <b>Channel</b>
              The  channel to record from. This is either the channel number as shown in the on-screen menus, or
              a complete channel ID. When reading  <u>timers.conf</u>  any  channel  numbers  will  be  mapped  to  the
              respective channel ids and when the file is written again, there will only be channel ids. Channel
              numbers  are  accepted  as input in order to allow easier creation of timers when manually editing
              <u>timers.conf</u>. Also, when timers are listed via SVDRP commands, the channels are given as numbers.

       <b>Day</b>    The day when this timer shall record.

              If this is a `single-shot' timer, this is the date on which this timer shall record, given in  ISO
              notation (<b>YYYY-MM-DD</b>), as in:

              <b>2005-03-19</b>

              For  compatibility  with  earlier  versions of VDR this may also be just the day of month on which
              this timer shall record (must be in the range <b>1...31</b>).

              In case of a `repeating' timer this is a string consisting of exactly seven characters, where each
              character position corresponds to one day of the week (with  Monday  being  the  first  day).  The
              character  '-'  at a certain position means that the timer shall not record on that day. Any other
              character will cause the timer to record on that day. Example:


              <b>MTWTF--</b>
              will define a timer that records on Monday through Friday and does not record on  weekends.   Note
              that only letters may be used here, no digits.  For compatibility with timers created with earlier
              versions  of  VDR, the same result could be achieved with <b>ABCDE--</b> (which was used to allow setting
              the days with language specific characters).  Since version 1.5.3 VDR can use UTF-8 characters  to
              present data to the user, but the weekday encoding in the <u>timers.conf</u> file always uses single byte
              characters.

              The  day  definition  of a `repeating' timer may be followed by the date when that timer shall hit
              for the first time. The format for this is <b>@YYYY-MM-DD</b>, so a complete definition could  look  like
              this:

              <b>MTWTF--@2002-02-18</b>

              which  would implement a timer that records Monday through Friday, and will hit for the first time
              on or after February 18, 2002.  This <b>first</b> <b>day</b> feature can be used to disable  a  repeating  timer
              for a couple of days, or for instance to define a new Mon...Fri timer on Wednesday, which actually
              starts "Monday next week". The <b>first</b> <b>day</b> date given need not be that of a day when the timer would
              actually hit.

       <b>Start</b>  A  four digit integer defining when this timer shall <b>start</b> recording.  The format is <b>hhmm</b>, so <b>1430</b>
              would mean "half past two" in the afternoon.

       <b>Stop</b>   A four digit integer defining when this timer shall <b>stop</b> recording.  The format is the same as for
              the <b>start</b> time.

       <b>Priority</b>
              An integer in the range <b>0...99</b>, defining the <b>priority</b> of this timer and of recordings  created  by
              this  timer.  <b>0</b> represents the lowest value, <b>99</b> the highest.  The priority is used to decide which
              timer shall be started in case there are two or more timers with the exact same  <b>start</b>  time.  The
              first timer in the list with the highest priority will be used.

              This value is also stored with the recording and is later used to decide which recording to remove
              from  disk  in  order to free space for a new recording. If the disk runs full and a new recording
              needs more space, an existing recording with the lowest  priority  (and  which  has  exceeded  its
              guaranteed <b>lifetime</b>) will be removed.

              If  all  available DVB cards are currently occupied, a timer with a higher priority will interrupt
              the timer with the lowest priority in order to start recording.

       <b>Lifetime</b>
              The <b>guaranteed</b> <b>lifetime</b> (in days) of a recording  created  by  this  timer.   <b>0</b>  means  that  this
              recording  may  be  automatically  deleted at any time by a new recording with higher priority. <b>99</b>
              means that this recording will never be automatically deleted. Any  number  in  the  range  <b>1...98</b>
              means that this recording may not be automatically deleted in favour of a new recording, until the
              given number of days since the <b>start</b> time of the recording has passed by.

       <b>File</b>   The <b>file</b> <b>name</b> this timer will give to a recording.  If the name contains any ':' characters, these
              have  to be replaced by '|'.  If the name shall contain subdirectories, these have to be delimited
              by '~' (since the '/' character may be part of a regular programme name).

              The special keywords <b>TITLE</b> and <b>EPISODE</b>, if present, will be replaced  by  the  title  and  episode
              information from the EPG data at the time of recording (if that data is available). If at the time
              of  recording  either  of  these cannot be determined, <b>TITLE</b> will default to the channel name, and
              <b>EPISODE</b> will default to a blank.

              The file name can be prepended with a pattern, enclosed in curly braces, as in

              {Columbo}Movies~TITLE

              which makes this a "pattern timer". A pattern timer records every event on the given channel where
              the title contains the pattern (case sensitive).  The following special characters can be used  in
              a pattern:
              <b>^</b>   anchor to the beginning of the event's title
              <b>$</b>   anchor to the end of the event's title
              <b>*</b>   match every event
              <b>@</b>   avoid duplicate recordings

              If  <b>@</b>  is  used,  it must be the very first character of the pattern.  If both <b>@</b> and <b>^</b> are used, <b>@</b>
              must come first.  If <b>*</b> is used, it must be the only character in  the  pattern  and  may  only  be
              prepended with <b>@</b>.

              In  addition  to  TITLE and EPISODE you can use the following macros to compose the file name (the
              curly braces are part of the macros):
              {&lt;}   everything before the matching pattern
              {&gt;}   everything after the matching pattern
              {=}   the matching pattern itself (just for completeness)

       <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>data</b>
              An arbitrary string that can be used by external applications to store any kind of data related to
              this timer. The string must not contain any newline characters. If this field is  not  empty,  its
              contents will be written into the <u>info</u> file of the recording with the '@' tag.

   <b>SOURCES</b>
       The  file  <u>sources.conf</u> defines the codes to be used in the <b>Source</b> field of channels in <u>channels.conf</u> and
       assigns descriptive texts to them.  Example:

       <b>S19.2E</b>  <b>Astra</b> <b>1</b>

       Anything after (and including) a '#' character is comment.

       The first character of the <b>code</b> must be one of
       <b>A</b>   ATSC
       <b>C</b>   Cable
       <b>S</b>   Satellite
       <b>T</b>   Terrestrial

       and is followed by further data pertaining to that particular source. In case of <b>S</b>atellite  this  is  the
       orbital  position  in  degrees,  followed  by  <b>E</b>  for  east or <b>W</b> for west.  Plugins may define additional
       sources, using other characters in the range 'A'...'Z'.

   <b>DISEQC</b>
       The file <u>diseqc.conf</u> defines the <b>DiSEqC</b> control sequences to be sent to the DVB-S card in order to access
       a given satellite position and/or band.  Example:

       <b>S19.2E</b>  <b>11700</b> <b>V</b>  <b>9750</b>  <b>t</b> <b>v</b> <b>W15</b> <b>[E0</b> <b>10</b> <b>38</b> <b>F0]</b> <b>W15</b> <b>A</b> <b>W15</b> <b>t</b>

       Anything after (and including) a '#' character is comment.

       The first word in a parameter line must be one of the codes defined in the file  <u>sources.conf</u>  and  tells
       which satellite this line applies to.

       Following  is  the  "switch  frequency" of the LNB (slof), which is the transponder frequency up to which
       this entry shall be used; the first entry with an slof greater than the actual transponder frequency will
       be used. Typically there is only one slof per LNB, but the syntax allows any number of  frequency  ranges
       to  be  defined.   Note  that there should be a last entry with the value <b>99999</b> for each satellite, which
       covers the upper frequency range.

       The third parameter defines the polarization to which  this  entry  applies.  It  can  be  either  <b>H</b>  for
       horizontal, <b>V</b> for vertical, <b>L</b> for circular left or <b>R</b> for circular right.

       The  fourth  parameter  specifies  the "local oscillator frequency" (lof) of the LNB to use for the given
       frequency range. This number will be subtracted from the actual transponder frequency when tuning to  the
       channel.

       The rest of the line holds the actual sequence of DiSEqC actions to be taken.  The code letters used here
       are
       <b>t</b>          22kHz tone off
       <b>T</b>          22kHz tone on
       <b>v</b>          voltage low (13V)
       <b>V</b>          voltage high (18V)
       <b>A</b>          mini A
       <b>B</b>          mini B
       <b>Pn</b>         use positioner to move dish to satellite position n (or to the satellite's orbital position, if no position number is given)
       <b>Sn</b>         Satellite channel routing code sequence for bank n follows
       <b>Wnn</b>        wait nn milliseconds (nn may be any positive integer number)
       <b>[xx</b> <b>...]</b>   hex code sequence (max. 6)
       There  can  be  any number of actions in a line, including none at all - in which case the entry would be
       used only to set the LOF to use for the given frequency range and polarization.

       By default it is assumed that every DVB-S device can receive every satellite.  If this is not the case in
       a particular setup, lines of the form

       <b>1</b> <b>2</b> <b>4:</b>

       may be inserted in the <u>diseqc.conf</u> file, defining the devices that are able  to  receive  the  satellites
       following  thereafter.  In this case, only the devices 1, 2 and 4 would be able to receive any satellites
       following this line and up to the next such line, or the end of the file. Devices may be listed more than
       once.

   <b>SATELLITE</b> <b>CHANNEL</b> <b>ROUTING</b> <b>(SCR)</b>
       The file <u>scr.conf</u> contains the channel definitions of the SCR device in use.  The format is

       channel frequency [pin]

       where channel is the SCR device's channel index (0-7), frequency is the user band frequency of the  given
       channel,  and  pin  is  an  optional pin number (0-255). The actual values are device specific and can be
       found in the SCR device's manual.

       Examples:

       0 1284
       1 1400
       2 1516
       3 1632
       4 1748
       5 1864
       6 1980
       7 2096

       By default it is assumed that the SCR configurations apply to all devices, and each device will pick one.
       If you have several SCR sat cables connected to one VDR machine, or if you want to explicitly assign  the
       SCR channels to your devices, lines of the form

       <b>1</b> <b>2</b> <b>4:</b>

       may  be  inserted  in  the  <u>scr.conf</u>  file, defining the devices that are allowed to use the SCR channels
       thereafter. In this case, only the devices 1, 2 and 4 would be allowed to use the SCR channels  following
       this  line  and  up  to the next such line, or the end of the file. If a device is listed more than once,
       only its first appearance counts.

   <b>REMOTE</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>KEYS</b>
       The file <u>remote.conf</u> contains the key assignments for all remote control units. Each line consists of one
       key assignment in the following format:

       <b>name.key</b>  <b>code</b>

       where <b>name</b> is the name of the remote control (for instance KBD for the  PC  keyboard,  or  LIRC  for  the
       "Linux  Infrared Remote Control"), <b>key</b> is the name of the key that is defined (like Up, Down, Menu etc.),
       and <b>code</b> is a character string that this remote control delivers when the given key is pressed.

   <b>KEY</b> <b>MACROS</b>
       The file <u>keymacros.conf</u> contains user defined macros that will be executed  whenever  the  given  key  is
       pressed. The format is

       <b>macrokey</b>  <b>[@plugin]</b> <b>key1</b> <b>key2</b> <b>key3...</b>

       where  <b>macrokey</b>  is  the  key that shall initiate execution of this macro and can be one of <u>Up</u>, <u>Down</u>, <u>Ok</u>,
       <u>Back</u>, <u>Left</u>, <u>Right</u>, <u>Red</u>, <u>Green</u>, <u>Yellow</u>, <u>Blue</u>, <u>0</u>...<u>9</u> or <u>User1</u>...<u>User9</u>. The rest of the line consists  of  a
       set  of keys, which will be executed just as if they had been pressed in the given sequence. The optional
       <b>@plugin</b> can be used to automatically select the given plugin.  <b>plugin</b> is the name of the plugin,  exactly
       as given in the -P option when starting VDR. There can be only one <b>@plugin</b> per key macro.  For instance

       <b>User1</b> <b>@abc</b> <b>Down</b> <b>Down</b> <b>Ok</b>

       would  call  the  main  menu function of the "abc" plugin and execute two "Down" key presses, followed by
       "Ok".
       Note that the color keys will only execute their macro function in "normal viewing" mode  (i.e.  when  no
       other  menu or player is active). The <u>User1</u>...<u>User9</u> keys will always execute their macro function.  There
       may be up to 15 keys in such a key sequence.

   <b>FOLDERS</b>
       The file <u>folders.conf</u> contains the definitions of folders that can be used in the "Edit timer" menu. Each
       line contains one folder definition. Leading whitespace and everything  after  and  including  a  '#'  is
       ignored.  A  line ending with '{' defines a sub folder (i.e. a folder that contains other folders), and a
       line consisting of only '}' ends the definition of a sub folder.

       Example:

       Daily {
         News
         Soaps
         }
       Archive {
         Movies
         Sports
         Sci-Fi {
           Star Trek
           U.F.O.
           }
         }
       Comedy
       Science

       Note that these folder definitions are only used to set the file name under which a timer will store  its
       recording. Changing these definitions in any way has no effect on existing timers or recordings.

   <b>COMMANDS</b>
       The file <u>commands.conf</u> contains the definitions of commands that can be executed from the <b>vdr</b> main menu's
       "Commands" option.  Each line contains one command definition in the following format:

       <b>title</b> <b>:</b> <b>command</b>

       where  <b>title</b>  is  the  string  that  will  be displayed in the "Commands" menu, and <b>command</b> is the actual
       command string that will be executed when this option is selected. The delimiting ':' may  be  surrounded
       by  any  number  of  white  space  characters.  If  <b>title</b>  ends  with  the character '?', there will be a
       confirmation prompt before actually executing the command. This can be used for commands that might  have
       serious results (like deleting files etc) to make sure they are not executed inadvertently.

       Everything following (and including) a '#' character is considered to be comment.

       You  can  have  nested  layers  of command menus by surrounding a sequence of commands with '{'...'}' and
       giving it a title, as in

       My Commands {
         First list {
           Do something: some command
           Do something else: another command
           }
         Second list {
           Even more: yet another command
           So much more: and yet another one
           }
         }

       Command lists can be nested to any depth.

       By default the menu entries in the "Commands" menu will be numbered '1'...'9' to make them selectable  by
       pressing  the  corresponding  number  key.  If  you  want to use your own numbering scheme (maybe to skip
       certain numbers), just precede the <b>title</b>s with  the  numbers  of  your  choice.  <b>vdr</b>  will  suppress  its
       automatic  numbering  if  the  first  entry  in <u>commands.conf</u> starts with a digit in the range '1'...'9',
       followed by a blank.

       In order to avoid error messages to the console, every command should have <u>stderr</u> redirected  to  <u>stdout</u>.
       Everything the command prints to <u>stdout</u> will be displayed in a result window, with <b>title</b> as its title.

       Examples:

       Check for new mail?: /usr/local/bin/checkmail 2&gt;&amp;1
       CPU status: /usr/local/bin/cpustatus 2&gt;&amp;1
       Disk space: df -h | grep '/video' | awk '{ print 100 - $5 "% free"; }'
       Calendar: date;echo;cal

       Note  that  the  commands 'checkmail' and 'cpustatus' are only <b>examples</b>!  Don't send emails to the author
       asking where to find these ;-)
       The '?' at the end of the "Check for new mail?" entry will prompt the user  whether  this  command  shall
       really be executed.

   <b>RECORDING</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       The  file  <u>reccmds.conf</u>  can  be used to define commands that can be applied to the currently highlighted
       recording in the  "Recordings"  menu.  The  syntax  is  exactly  the  same  as  described  for  the  file
       <u>commands.conf</u>.  When  executing  a  command,  the directory name of the recording will be appended to the
       command string, separated by a blank and enclosed in single quotes.

   <b>SVDRP</b> <b>HOSTS</b>
       The file <u>svdrphosts.conf</u> contains the IP numbers of all hosts that are allowed to access the SVDRP  port.
       Each line contains one IP number in the format

       <b>IP-Address[/Netmask]</b>

       where  <b>IP-Address</b>  is  the  address  of  a  host  or a network in the usual dot separated notation (as in
       192.168.100.1). If the optional <b>Netmask</b> is given only the given number of bits of  <b>IP-Address</b>  are  taken
       into account. This allows you to grant SVDRP access to all hosts of an entire network. <b>Netmask</b> can be any
       integer  from 1 to 32. The special value of 0 is only accepted if the <b>IP-Address</b> is 0.0.0.0, because this
       will give access to any host (<b>USE</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>CARE!</b>).

       Everything following (and including) a '#' character is considered to be comment.

       Examples:

       127.0.0.1        # always accept localhost
       192.168.100.0/24 # any host on the local net
       204.152.189.113  # a specific host
       0.0.0.0/0        # any host on any net (<b>USE</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>CARE!</b>)

   <b>SETUP</b>
       The file <u>setup.conf</u> contains the basic configuration options for <b>vdr</b>.  Each line contains one  option  in
       the format "Name = Value".  See the MANUAL file for a description of the available options.

   <b>THEMES</b>
       The files <u>themes/&lt;skin&gt;-&lt;theme&gt;.theme</u> in the config directory contain the color theme definitions for the
       various  skins.  In  the  actual  file  names  <u>&lt;skin&gt;</u> will be replaced by the name if the skin this theme
       belongs to, and <u>&lt;theme&gt;</u> will be the name of this theme.  Each line in a theme file contains one option in
       the format "Name = Value".  Anything after (and including) a '#' character is comment.

       The definitions in a theme file are either <b>colors</b> or a <b>description</b>.
       <b>Colors</b> are in the form

       <b>clrTitle</b> <b>=</b> <b>FF123456</b>

       where the name (clrTitle) is one of the names defined in the source code  of  the  <b>skin</b>  that  uses  this
       theme,  through the <b>THEME_CLR()</b> macro.  The value (FF123456) is an eight digit hex number that consist of
       four bytes, representing alpha (transparency), red, green and blue component  of  the  color.   An  alpha
       value  of  00  means  the  color will be completely transparent, while FF means it will be opaque. An RGB
       value of 000000 results in black, while FFFFFF is white.

       A <b>description</b> can be given as

       <b>Description</b> <b>=</b> <b>Shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>blue</b>

       and will be used in the Setup/OSD menu to select a theme for a given skin.  The description  should  give
       the  user  an  idea what this theme will be like (for instance, in the given example it would use various
       shades of blue), and shouldn't be too long to make sure  it  fits  on  the  Setup  screen.   The  default
       description  always  should  be  given  in  English.  If  you  want,  you  can  provide language specific
       descriptions as

       <b>Description.eng</b> <b>=</b> <b>Shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>blue</b>
       <b>Description.ger</b> <b>=</b> <b>Blautöne</b>

       where the language code is added to the keyword "Description", separated by a dot. You can enter as  many
       language specific descriptions as you like, but only those that have a corresponding locale messages file
       will be actually used.  If a theme file doesn't contain a Description, the name of the theme (as given in
       the theme's file name) will be used.

   <b>AUDIO/VIDEO</b> <b>DATA</b>
       The  files  <u>00001.ts</u>...<u>65535.ts</u>  are  the  actual  recorded  data  files. In order to keep the size of an
       individual file below a given limit, a recording may be split into several files. The contents  of  these
       files is <b>Transport</b> <b>Stream</b> (TS) and contains data packets that are each 188 byte long and start with 0x47.
       Data  is  stored  exactly  as  it  is  broadcast,  with  a  generated PAT/PMT inserted right before every
       independent frame.

   <b>INDEX</b>
       The file <u>index</u> (if present in a recording directory) contains the (binary) index data into  each  of  the
       the  recording  files  <u>00001.ts</u>...<u>65535.ts</u>.  It  is  used during replay to determine the current position
       within the recording, and to implement skipping and fast forward/back functions.  See the  definition  of
       the <b>cIndexFile</b> class for details about the actual contents of this file.

   <b>INFO</b>
       The file <u>info</u> (if present in a recording directory) contains a description of the recording, derived from
       the EPG data at recording time (if such data was available). The <b>Aux</b> field of the corresponding timer (if
       given) is copied into this file, using the '@' tag.  This is a plain ASCII file and contains tagged lines
       like  the <b>EPG</b> <b>DATA</b> file (see the description of the <u>epg.data</u> file). Note that the lowercase tags ('c' and
       'e') will not appear in an <u>info</u> file.  Lines tagged with '#' are ignored and  can  be  used  by  external
       tools to store arbitrary information.

       In addition to the tags used in the <u>epg.data</u> file, the following tag characters are defined:
       <b>F</b>   &lt;frame rate&gt; &lt;frame width&gt; &lt;frame height&gt; &lt;scan type&gt; &lt;aspect ratio&gt;
       <b>L</b>   &lt;lifetime&gt;
       <b>P</b>   &lt;priority&gt;
       <b>O</b>   &lt;errors&gt;
       <b>@</b>   &lt;auxiliary data&gt;

       The  'O'  tag contains the number of errors that occurred during recording.  If it is zero, the recording
       can be safely considered error free. The higher the value, the more damaged the recording is.  If this is
       an edited recording, the number of errors is that of the original recording.

   <b>RESUME</b>
       The file <u>resume</u> (if present in a recording directory) contains the position within  the  recording  where
       the last replay session left off.  The file consists of tagged lines that describe the various parameters
       necessary to pick up replay where it left off.

       The following tag characters are defined:
       <b>I</b>   &lt;offset into the file <u>index</u>&gt;

   <b>MARKS</b>
       The  file  <u>marks</u>  (if  present  in  a  recording  directory)  contains the editing marks defined for this
       recording.  Each line contains the definition of one mark in the following format:

       <b>hh:mm:ss.ff</b> <b>comment</b>

       where <b>hh:mm:ss.ff</b> is a frame position within  the  recording,  given  as  "hours,  minutes,  seconds  and
       (optional)  frame number".  <b>comment</b> can be any string and may be used to describe this mark.  If present,
       <b>comment</b> must be separated from the frame position by at least one blank.

       The lines in this file need not necessarily appear  in  the  correct  temporal  sequence,  they  will  be
       automatically sorted by time index.

       If  a  frame  position  doesn't  point  to  an I-frame of the corresponding recording, it will be shifted
       towards the next I-frame (either up or down, whichever is closer).

       <b>CURRENT</b> <b>RESTRICTIONS:</b>

       - the comment is currently not used by VDR

   <b>SORT</b> <b>MODE</b>
       The file <u>.sort</u> (if present in a directory) contains an integer number defining the  mode  by  which  this
       directory shall be sorted when presented in a menu.

       The following values are defined:
       <b>0</b>   sort by name
       <b>1</b>   sort by time

   <b>RECORDING</b> <b>TIMER</b>
       The file <u>.timer</u> (if present in a recording directory) contains the full id of the timer that is currently
       recording into this directory.  Timer ids are of the form

       <b>id@hostname</b>

       where  <b>id</b>  is  the timer's numerical id on the VDR with the name <b>hostname</b>.  This file is created when the
       timer starts recording, and is deleted when it ends.

   <b>EPG</b> <b>DATA</b>
       The file <u>epg.data</u> contains the EPG data in an easily parsable format.  The first character of  each  line
       defines what kind of data this line contains.

       The following tag characters are defined:
       <b>C</b>   &lt;channel id&gt; &lt;channel name&gt;
       <b>E</b>   &lt;event id&gt; &lt;start time&gt; &lt;duration&gt; &lt;table id&gt; &lt;version&gt;
       <b>T</b>   &lt;title&gt;
       <b>S</b>   &lt;short text&gt;
       <b>D</b>   &lt;description&gt;
       <b>G</b>   &lt;genre&gt; &lt;genre&gt;...
       <b>R</b>   &lt;parental rating&gt;
       <b>X</b>   &lt;stream&gt; &lt;type&gt; &lt;language&gt; &lt;descr&gt;
       <b>V</b>   &lt;vps time&gt;
       <b>@</b>   &lt;auxiliary data&gt;
       <b>e</b>
       <b>c</b>

       Lowercase  characters  mark  the  end  of  a  sequence  that  was  started by the corresponding uppercase
       character. The outer frame consists of a sequence of one or more <b>C</b>...<b>c</b> (Channel)  entries.  Inside  these
       any  number  of  <b>E</b>...<b>e</b>  (Event)  entries  are allowed.  All other tags are optional (although every event
       should at least have a <b>T</b> entry).

       There may be several <b>X</b> tags, depending on the number of tracks (video, audio etc.)  the event provides.
       &lt;channel id&gt;        is the "channel ID", made up from the parameters defined in 'channels.conf'
       &lt;channel name&gt;      is the "name" as in 'channels.conf' (for information only, may be left out)
       &lt;event id&gt;          is a 32 bit unsigned int, uniquely identifying this event (see note)
       &lt;start time&gt;        is the time (as a time_t integer) in UTC when this event starts
       &lt;duration&gt;          is the time (in seconds) that this event will take
       &lt;table id&gt;          is a hex number that indicates the table this event is contained in (if this is left empty it will be set to 0x00; and value less than 0x4E it will be treated as if it were 0x4E)
       &lt;version&gt;           is a hex number that indicates the event's version number inside its table (optional, ignored when reading EPG data)
       &lt;title&gt;             is the title of the event
       &lt;short text&gt;        is the short text of the event (typically the name of the episode etc.)
       &lt;description&gt;       is the description of the event (any '|' characters will be interpreted as newlines)
       &lt;genre&gt;             is a two digit hex code, as defined in  ETSI EN 300 468, table 28 (up to 4 genre codes are supported)
       &lt;parental rating&gt;   is the minimum age of the intended audience
       &lt;stream&gt;            is the stream content (1 = MPEG2 video, 2 = MP2 audio, 3 = subtitles, 4 = AC3 audio, 5 = H.264 video, 6 = HEAAC audio, 0x09=H.265 video, 0x19 = AC4 audio)
       &lt;type&gt;              is the stream type according to ETSI EN 300 468
       &lt;language&gt;          is the three letter language code (optionally two codes, separated by '+')
       &lt;descr&gt;             is the description of this stream component
       &lt;vps time&gt;          is the Video Programming Service time of this event
       &lt;auxiliary data&gt;    is an arbitrary string that can be used by external applications to store data; newline characters will be replaced with '|' when writing the <u>epg.data</u> file.

       This file will be read at program startup in order to restore the results of previous EPG scans.

       Note that the <b>event</b> <b>id</b> that comes from the DVB data stream is actually just 16  bit  wide.  The  internal
       representation  in VDR allows for 32 bit to be used, so that external tools can generate EPG data that is
       guaranteed not to collide with the ids of existing data.  Also note that  some  broadcasters  change  the
       <b>event</b> <b>id</b> when an event is moved from one table to another.

       The  <b>auxiliary</b> <b>data</b> can be used for plugin specific purposes and has no meaning whatsoever to VDR itself.
       It will <b>not</b> be written into the <u>info</u> file of a recording that is made for such an event.

   <b>CAM</b> <b>DATA</b>
       The file <u>cam.data</u> contains information about which CAM in the system can decrypt  a  particular  channel.
       Each  line  in  this  file  contains  a  channel  id,  followed by one or more (blank separated) numbers,
       indicating the CAMs that have successfully decrypted this channel earlier.

       When tuning to an encrypted channel, this information is used to select the  proper  CAM  for  decrypting
       this  channel.  This  channel/CAM  relationship  is  not  hardcoded,  though. If a given channel can't be
       decrypted with a CAM listed in this file, other CAMs will be tried just as well. The main purpose of this
       file is to speed up channel switching in systems with more than one CAM.

       This file will be read at program startup and saved when the program ends.  If the file is read-only,  it
       will not be overwritten.

   <b>CAM</b> <b>AUTO</b> <b>RESPONSE</b>
       If  your  CAM  keeps popping up annoying messages or you want to make sure VDR can record programmes with
       parental rating without having to enter the PIN (in case you can't turn that off in your  CAM),  you  can
       set up auto responses in the file <u>camresponses.conf</u>.

       Each line in this file specifies one rule to apply to texts received from the CAM. If the CAM's menu text
       matches  the  text  in  one of these rules, the given action is taken and sent to the CAM as an automatic
       response, without any menu appearing on the screen. The first match wins.

       The format of these rules is:

       nr text action

       where
       nr          is the number of the CAM this action applies to (0 = all CAMs)
       text        is the text in the CAM menu to react on (must be quoted with '"' if it contains blanks, escape '"' with '\')
       action      is the action to take if the given text is encountered

       Possible actions are:
       DISCARD     simply discard the menu (equivalent to pressing 'Back' on the RC)
       CONFIRM     confirm the menu (equivalent to pressing 'OK' without selecting a particular item)
       SELECT      select the menu item containing the text (equivalent to positioning the cursor on the item and pressing 'OK')
       &lt;number&gt;    the given number is sent to the CAM as if it were tyed in by the user (provided this is an input field).

       Note that the text given in a rule must match exactly, including any leading or trailing  blanks.  If  in
       doubt, you can get the exact text from the log file.  Action keywords are case insensitive.

       Everything following (and including) a '#' character is considered to be comment.

   <b>COMMANDLINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       If  started  without any options, vdr tries to read any files in the directory /etc/vdr/conf.d with names
       that do not begin with a '.' and that end with '.conf'.  These files are read in alphabetical order.  The
       format of these files is

       # comment
       [name]
       -a
       -b 123
       --long
       --longarg=123

       Any  lines  that  begin  with  '#'  as the first non-whitespace character are considered comments and are
       ignored.  A command line option file consists of one or  more  sections,  indicated  by  '[name]',  where
       'name'  is either the fixed word 'vdr' (if this section contains options for the main VDR program) or the
       name of the plugin this section applies to.  Each option must be written on a  separate  line,  including
       the leading '-' (for a short option) or '--' (for a long option). If the option has additional arguments,
       they  have  to  be  written on the same line as the option itself, separated from the option with a blank
       (short option) or equal sign (long option).
