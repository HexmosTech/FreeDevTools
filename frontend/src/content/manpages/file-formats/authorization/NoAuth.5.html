       NoAuth - Disables authorization checking

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>NoAuth</u> file, if present in a server machine's <u>/var/lib/openafs/local</u> directory, indicates to the AFS
       server processes running on the machine that it is not necessary to perform authorization checking. They
       perform any action for any user who logs into the machine's local file system or issues a remote command
       that affects the machine's AFS server functioning, such as commands from the AFS command suites. Because
       failure to check authorization exposes the machine's AFS server functionality to attack, there are
       normally only two circumstances in which the file is present:

       •   During installation of the machine, as instructed in the <u>OpenAFS</u> <u>Quick</u> <u>Start</u> <u>Guide</u>.

       •   During  correction  of  a server encryption key emergency, as discussed in the <u>OpenAFS</u> <u>Administration</u>
           <u>Guide</u>.

       In all other circumstances, the absence  of  the  file  means  that  the  AFS  server  processes  perform
       authorization checking, verifying that the issuer of a command has the required privilege.

       Create the file in one of the following ways:

       •   By  issuing  the  bosserver initialization command with the <b>-noauth</b> flag, if the Basic OverSeer (BOS)
           Server is not already running.

       •   By issuing the <b>bos</b> <b>setauth</b> command with off as the value for the <b>-authrequired</b> argument, if  the  BOS
           Server is already running.

       To remove the file, issue the <b>bos</b> <b>setauth</b> command with "on" as the value for the <b>-authrequired</b> argument.

       The file's contents, if any, are ignored; an empty (zero-length) file is effective.
