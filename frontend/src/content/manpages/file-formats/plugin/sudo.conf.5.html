</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sudo.conf — configuration for sudo front-end

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sudo.conf</b>  file  is  used  to  configure  the <b>sudo</b> front-end.  It is used to configure sudo plugins,
       plugin-agnostic path names, debug flags, and other settings.

       The <b>sudo.conf</b> file supports the following directives, described in detail below.

       Plugin  an approval, audit, I/O logging, or security policy plugin

       Path    a plugin-agnostic path

       Set     a front-end setting, such as <u>disable_coredump</u> or <u>group_source</u>

       Debug   debug flags to aid in debugging <b>sudo</b>, <b>sudoreplay</b>, <b>visudo</b>, and the <b>sudoers</b> plugin.

       The pound sign (‘#’) is used to indicate a comment.  Both the comment character and any text after it, up
       to the end of the line, are ignored.

       Long lines can be continued with a backslash (‘\’) as the last character  on  the  line.   Leading  white
       space is removed from the beginning of lines even when a continuation character is used.

       Non-comment lines that don't begin with <u>Plugin</u>, <u>Path</u>, <u>Debug</u>, or <u>Set</u> are silently ignored.

       The <b>sudo.conf</b> file is always parsed in the ‘C’ locale.

   <b>Plugin</b> <b>configuration</b>
       <b>sudo</b>  supports  a  plugin architecture for security policies and input/output logging.  Third parties can
       develop and distribute their own policy and I/O logging plugins to work seamlessly with the  <b>sudo</b>  front-
       end.  Plugins are dynamically loaded based on the contents of <b>sudo.conf</b>.

       A  <u>Plugin</u>  line  consists  of the <u>Plugin</u> keyword, followed by the <u>symbol_name</u> and the <u>path</u> to the dynamic
       shared object that contains the plugin.  The <u>symbol_name</u> is  the  name  of  the  <u>struct</u>  <u>approval_plugin</u>,
       <u>struct</u>  <u>audit_plugin</u>,  <u>struct</u>  <u>io_plugin</u>,  or  <u>struct</u>  <u>policy_plugin</u>  defined by the plugin.  If a plugin
       implements multiple plugin types, there must be a <u>Plugin</u> line for each unique symbol name.  The <u>path</u>  may
       be fully qualified or relative.  If not fully qualified, it is relative to the directory specified by the
       <u>plugin_dir</u> <u>Path</u> setting, which defaults to <u><a href="file:/usr/libexec/sudo">/usr/libexec/sudo</a></u>.  In other words:

           Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so

       is equivalent to:

           Plugin sudoers_policy <a href="file:/usr/libexec/sudo/sudoers.so">/usr/libexec/sudo/sudoers.so</a>

       If the plugin was compiled statically into the <b>sudo</b> binary instead of being installed as a dynamic shared
       object,  the  <u>path</u>  should be specified without a leading directory, as it does not actually exist in the
       file system.  For example:

           Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so

       On AIX systems, the plugin may be either a shared object ending in ‘.so’ or an archive file containing  a
       shared object ending in ‘.a’ with the name of the shared object in parentheses at the end.

       Starting  with  <b>sudo</b>  1.8.5,  any  additional  parameters  after  the <u>path</u> are passed as arguments to the
       plugin's <u>open</u> function.  For example, to override the compile-time default sudoers file mode:

           Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so sudoers_mode=0440

       See the <u><a href="../man5/sudoers.5.html">sudoers</a></u>(5) manual for a list of supported arguments.

       The same dynamic shared object may contain multiple plugins, each with a different symbol name.  The file
       must be owned by user-ID 0 and only writable by its  owner.   Because  of  ambiguities  that  arise  from
       composite  policies, only a single policy plugin may be specified.  This limitation does not apply to I/O
       plugins.

       If no <b>sudo.conf</b> file is present, or if it contains no <u>Plugin</u> lines, the <b>sudoers</b> plugin will  be  used  as
       the  default  security  policy,  for  I/O  logging (if enabled by the policy), and for auditing.  This is
       equivalent to the following:

           Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so
           Plugin sudoers_io sudoers.so
           Plugin sudoers_audit sudoers.so

       Starting with <b>sudo</b> version 1.9.1, some of the logging functionality of the <b>sudoers</b> plugin has been  moved
       from  the  policy  plugin  to an audit plugin.  To maintain compatibility with <b>sudo.conf</b> files from older
       <b>sudo</b> versions, if <b>sudoers</b> is configured as the security policy, it will be used as  an  audit  plugin  as
       well.   This guarantees that the logging behavior will be consistent with that of <b>sudo</b> versions 1.9.0 and
       below.

       For more information on the <b>sudo</b> plugin architecture, see the <u><a href="../man5/sudo_plugin.5.html">sudo_plugin</a></u>(5) manual.

   <b>Path</b> <b>settings</b>
       A <u>Path</u> line consists of the <u>Path</u> keyword, followed by the name of the path to set  and  its  value.   For
       example:

           Path intercept <a href="file:/usr/libexec/sudo/sudo_intercept.so">/usr/libexec/sudo/sudo_intercept.so</a>
           Path noexec <a href="file:/usr/libexec/sudo/sudo_noexec.so">/usr/libexec/sudo/sudo_noexec.so</a>
           Path askpass /usr/bin/ssh-askpass

       If no path name is specified, features relying on the specified setting will be disabled.  Disabling <u>Path</u>
       settings is only supported in <b>sudo</b> version 1.8.16 and higher.

       The following plugin-agnostic paths may be set in the <u><a href="file:/etc/sudo.conf">/etc/sudo.conf</a></u> file:

       askpass
             The  fully  qualified path to a helper program used to read the user's password when no terminal is
             available.  This may be the case when <b>sudo</b> is executed from a graphical (as opposed to  text-based)
             application.   The  program  specified  by  <u>askpass</u> should display the argument passed to it as the
             prompt and write the user's password  to  the  standard  output.   The  value  of  <u>askpass</u>  may  be
             overridden by the SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable.

       devsearch
             An  ordered,  colon-separated search path of directories to look in for device nodes.  This is used
             when mapping the process's tty device number to a device name on systems that do not provide such a
             mechanism.  Sudo will <u>not</u> recurse into sub-directories.  If terminal devices may be  located  in  a
             sub-directory  of  <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u>,  that  path  must be explicitly listed in <u>devsearch</u>.  The default value is
             <u><a href="file:/dev/pts">/dev/pts</a>:/dev/vt:/dev/term:/dev/zcons:/dev/pty:<a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u>

             This option is ignored on systems that support either the <b>devname</b>()  or  <b>_ttyname_dev</b>()  functions,
             for example BSD, macOS and Solaris.

       intercept
             The  path  to  a  shared  library  containing  a  wrappers  for the <u><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></u>(2), <u><a href="../man3/execl.3.html">execl</a></u>(3), <u><a href="../man3/execle.3.html">execle</a></u>(3),
             <u><a href="../man3/execlp.3.html">execlp</a></u>(3), <u><a href="../man3/execv.3.html">execv</a></u>(3),  <u><a href="../man3/execvp.3.html">execvp</a></u>(3),  <u><a href="../man3/execvpe.3.html">execvpe</a></u>(3),  and  <u><a href="../man3/system.3.html">system</a></u>(3)  library  functions  that  intercepts
             attempts  to  run further commands and performs a policy check before allowing them to be executed.
             This is used to implement the <u>intercept</u> and  <u>log_subcmds</u>  functionality  on  systems  that  support
             LD_PRELOAD or the equivalent.

             The <u>intercept</u> path may be set to either a single fully-qualified path, or, for systems that support
             separate  LD_PRELOAD  environment variables for 32-bit and 64-bit executables, it may optionally be
             set to two fully-qualified paths separated by a colon (‘:’).  The first path should be  the  32-bit
             version  and  the second the 64-bit version.  This two-path form is currently only supported on AIX
             and Solaris systems.  The default value is <u><a href="file:/usr/libexec/sudo/sudo_intercept.so">/usr/libexec/sudo/sudo_intercept.so</a></u>.

       noexec
             The path to a shared library containing wrappers for the <u><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></u>(2), <u><a href="../man3/execl.3.html">execl</a></u>(3), <u><a href="../man3/execle.3.html">execle</a></u>(3), <u><a href="../man3/execlp.3.html">execlp</a></u>(3),
             <u><a href="../man3/exect.3.html">exect</a></u>(3),  <u><a href="../man3/execv.3.html">execv</a></u>(3),  <u><a href="../man3/execveat.3.html">execveat</a></u>(3),  <u><a href="../man3/execvP.3.html">execvP</a></u>(3),   <u><a href="../man3/execvp.3.html">execvp</a></u>(3),   <u><a href="../man3/execvpe.3.html">execvpe</a></u>(3),   <u><a href="../man3/fexecve.3.html">fexecve</a></u>(3),   <u><a href="../man3/popen.3.html">popen</a></u>(3),
             <u><a href="../man3/posix_spawn.3.html">posix_spawn</a></u>(3),  <u><a href="../man3/posix_spawnp.3.html">posix_spawnp</a></u>(3),  <u><a href="../man3/system.3.html">system</a></u>(3),  and  <u><a href="../man3/wordexp.3.html">wordexp</a></u>(3)  library  functions that prevent the
             execution of further commands.  This is used to implement the <u>noexec</u> functionality on systems  that
             support LD_PRELOAD or the equivalent.

             The  <u>noexec</u>  path  may be set to either a single fully-qualified path, or, for systems that support
             separate LD_PRELOAD environment variables for 32-bit and 64-bit executables, it may  optionally  be
             set  to  two fully-qualified paths separated by a colon (‘:’).  The first path should be the 32-bit
             version and the second the 64-bit version.  This two-path form is currently only supported  on  AIX
             and Solaris systems.  The default value is <u><a href="file:/usr/libexec/sudo/sudo_noexec.so">/usr/libexec/sudo/sudo_noexec.so</a></u>.

       plugin_dir
             The  default  directory  to  use  when  searching  for  plugins  that are specified without a fully
             qualified path name.  The default value is <u><a href="file:/usr/libexec/sudo">/usr/libexec/sudo</a></u>.

       sesh  The fully-qualified path to the <b>sesh</b> binary.  This setting is only used when  <b>sudo</b>  is  built  with
             SELinux support.  The default value is <u><a href="file:/usr/libexec/sudo/sesh">/usr/libexec/sudo/sesh</a></u>.

   <b>Other</b> <b>settings</b>
       The <b>sudo.conf</b> file also supports the following front-end settings:

       disable_coredump
             Core  dumps  of  <b>sudo</b>  itself  are  disabled  by  default  to prevent the disclosure of potentially
             sensitive information.  To aid in debugging <b>sudo</b> crashes, you may wish to re-enable core  dumps  by
             setting “disable_coredump” to false in <b>sudo.conf</b> as follows:

                 Set disable_coredump false

             All  modern operating systems place restrictions on core dumps from set-user-ID processes like <b>sudo</b>
             so this option can be enabled without compromising security.  To actually get a <b>sudo</b> core file  you
             will  likely need to enable core dumps for set-user-ID processes.  On BSD and Linux systems this is
             accomplished in the <u><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></u>(8) command.  On Solaris, the <u><a href="../man1m/coreadm.1m.html">coreadm</a></u>(1m) command is  used  to  configure
             core dump behavior.

             This setting is only available in <b>sudo</b> version 1.8.4 and higher.

       group_source
             <b>sudo</b>  passes  the invoking user's group list to the policy and I/O plugins.  On most systems, there
             is an upper limit to the number of groups that a user may belong to  simultaneously  (typically  16
             for compatibility with NFS).  On systems with the <u><a href="../man1/getconf.1.html">getconf</a></u>(1) utility, running:
                   <b>getconf</b> <b>NGROUPS_MAX</b>
             will return the maximum number of groups.

             However,  it  is  still  possible to be a member of a larger number of groups--they simply won't be
             included in the group list returned by the kernel for the user.  Starting with <b>sudo</b> version  1.8.7,
             if  the  user's  kernel  group  list has the maximum number of entries, <b>sudo</b> will consult the group
             database directly to determine the group list.  This makes it possible for the security  policy  to
             perform  matching  by  group name even when the user is a member of more than the maximum number of
             groups.

             The <u>group_source</u> setting allows the administrator  to  change  this  default  behavior.   Supported
             values for <u>group_source</u> are:

             static
                   Use  the  static  group  list that the kernel returns.  Retrieving the group list this way is
                   very fast but it is subject to an upper limit as described above.  It is “static” in that  it
                   does  not  reflect  changes  to the group database made after the user logs in.  This was the
                   default behavior prior to <b>sudo</b> 1.8.7.

             dynamic
                   Always query the group database directly.  It is “dynamic” in that changes made to the  group
                   database  after  the  user  logs  in  will  be reflected in the group list.  On some systems,
                   querying the group database for all of a user's groups can be time consuming when querying  a
                   network-based  group  database.   Most  operating  systems  provide  an  efficient  method of
                   performing such queries.  Currently, <b>sudo</b> supports  efficient  group  queries  on  AIX,  BSD,
                   Linux, macOS, and Solaris.  This is the default behavior on macOS in <b>sudo</b> 1.9.6 and higher.

             adaptive
                   Only query the group database if the static group list returned by the kernel has the maximum
                   number  of  entries.   This is the default behavior on systems other than macOS in <b>sudo</b> 1.8.7
                   and higher.

             For example, to cause <b>sudo</b> to only use the kernel's static list of groups for the user:

                 Set group_source static

             This setting is only available in <b>sudo</b> version 1.8.7 and higher.

       max_groups
             The maximum number of user groups to retrieve from the group database.  Values  less  than  one  or
             larger  than  1024  will  be  ignored.   This setting is only used when querying the group database
             directly.  It is intended to be used on systems where it is not possible to detect when  the  array
             to  be populated with group entries is not sufficiently large.  By default, <b>sudo</b> will allocate four
             times the system's maximum number of groups (see above) and retry with double that  number  if  the
             group database query fails.

             This setting is only available in <b>sudo</b> version 1.8.7 and higher.  It should not be required in <b>sudo</b>
             versions 1.8.24 and higher and may be removed in a later release.

       probe_interfaces
             By default, <b>sudo</b> will probe the system's network interfaces and pass the IP address of each enabled
             interface  to the policy plugin.  This makes it possible for the plugin to match rules based on the
             IP address without having to  query  DNS.   On  Linux  systems  with  a  large  number  of  virtual
             interfaces,  this  may take a non-negligible amount of time.  If IP-based matching is not required,
             network interface probing can be disabled as follows:

                 Set probe_interfaces false

             This setting is only available in <b>sudo</b> version 1.8.10 and higher.

   <b>Debug</b> <b>settings</b>
       <b>sudo</b> versions 1.8.4 and higher support a flexible debugging framework that can log  what  <b>sudo</b>  is  doing
       internally if there is a problem.

       A <u>Debug</u> line consists of the <u>Debug</u> keyword, followed by the name of the program, plugin, or shared object
       to  debug, the debug file name, and a comma-separated list of debug flags.  The debug flag syntax used by
       <b>sudo</b>, the <b>sudoers</b> plugin along with its associated programs and shared objects is <u>subsystem</u>@<u>priority</u>  but
       a third-party plugin is free to use a different format so long as it does not include a comma (‘,’).

       On  AIX  systems,  a  <u>Debug</u> line will match a plugin specified as either the name of an SVR4-style shared
       object file ending in ‘.so’, an archive file ending in ‘.a’, or an archive file ending in ‘.a’  with  the
       name of the shared object in parentheses.

       Examples:

           Debug sudo /var/log/sudo_debug all@warn,plugin@info

       would  log  all  debugging statements at the <u>warn</u> level and higher in addition to those at the <u>info</u> level
       for the plugin subsystem.

           Debug sudo_intercept.so /var/log/intercept_debug all@debug

       would log all debugging statements, regardless of level, for the <u>sudo_intercept.so</u>  shared  library  that
       implements <b>sudo</b>'s intercept functionality on some systems.

           Debug sudoers.so /var/log/sudoers_debug all@debug

       would  log all debugging statements, regardless of level, for the <b>sudoers</b> plugin.  See <u><a href="../man5/sudoers.5.html">sudoers</a></u>(5) for the
       full list of subsystems supported by the <b>sudoers</b> plugin.

       As of <b>sudo</b> 1.8.12, multiple <u>Debug</u> entries may be specified per program.   Older  versions  of  <b>sudo</b>  only
       support a single <u>Debug</u> entry per program.  Plugin-specific <u>Debug</u> entries are also supported starting with
       <b>sudo</b>  1.8.12  and  are  matched  by  either  the  base  name  of  the plugin that was loaded (for example
       <u>sudoers.so</u>) or by the plugin's fully-qualified path name.  Previously, the <b>sudoers</b> plugin shared the same
       <u>Debug</u> entry as the <b>sudo</b> front-end and could not be configured separately.

       The following priorities are supported, in order of decreasing severity: <u>crit</u>, <u>err</u>, <u>warn</u>,  <u>notice</u>,  <u>diag</u>,
       <u>info</u>, <u>trace</u>, and <u>debug</u>.  Each priority, when specified, also includes all priorities higher than it.  For
       example, a priority of <u>notice</u> would include debug messages logged at <u>notice</u> and higher.

       The  priorities  <u>trace</u> and <u>debug</u> also include function call tracing which logs when a function is entered
       and when it returns.  For example, the following trace is for the <b>get_user_groups</b>() function  located  in
       src/sudo.c:

           sudo[123] -&gt; get_user_groups @ src/sudo.c:385
           sudo[123] &lt;- get_user_groups @ src/sudo.c:429 := groups=10,0,5

       When  the function is entered, indicated by a right arrow ‘-&gt;’, the program, process ID, function, source
       file, and line number are logged.  When the function returns, indicated by a left arrow  ‘&lt;-’,  the  same
       information is logged along with the return value.  In this case, the return value is a string.

       The following subsystems are used by the <b>sudo</b> front-end:

       <u>all</u>         matches every subsystem

       <u>args</u>        command line argument processing

       <u>conv</u>        user conversation

       <u>edit</u>        sudoedit

       <u>event</u>       event subsystem

       <u>exec</u>        command execution

       <u>main</u>        <b>sudo</b> main function

       <u>netif</u>       network interface handling

       <u>pcomm</u>       communication with the plugin

       <u>plugin</u>      plugin configuration

       <u>pty</u>         pseudo-terminal related code

       <u>selinux</u>     SELinux-specific handling

       <u>util</u>        utility functions

       <u>utmp</u>        utmp handling

       The <u><a href="../man5/sudoers.5.html">sudoers</a></u>(5) plugin includes support for additional subsystems.

       #
       # An askpass helper program may be specified to provide a graphical
       # password prompt for "sudo -A" support.  Sudo does not ship with its
       # own askpass program but can use the OpenSSH askpass.
       #
       # Use the OpenSSH askpass
       #Path askpass /usr/bin/ssh-askpass

       #
       # A colon-separated list of paths to check when searching for a user's

       # Sudo command interception:
       #   Path intercept /path/to/sudo_intercept.so
       #
       # Path to a shared library containing replacements for the execv()
       # and execve() library functions that perform a policy check to verify
       # the command is allowed and simply return an error if not.  This is
       # used to implement the "intercept" functionality on systems that
       # support LD_PRELOAD or its equivalent.
       #
       # The compiled-in value is usually sufficient and should only be changed
       # if you rename or move the sudo_intercept.so file.
       #
       #Path intercept <a href="file:/usr/libexec/sudo/sudo_intercept.so">/usr/libexec/sudo/sudo_intercept.so</a>

       #
       # Sudo noexec:
       #   Path noexec /path/to/sudo_noexec.so
       #
       # Path to a shared library containing replacements for the execv()
       # family of library functions that just return an error.  This is
       # used to implement the "noexec" functionality on systems that support
       # LD_PRELOAD or its equivalent.
       #
       # The compiled-in value is usually sufficient and should only be changed

       # Sudo plugin directory:
       #   Path plugin_dir /path/to/plugins
       #
       # The default directory to use when searching for plugins that are
       # specified without a fully qualified path name.

       #Path plugin_dir <a href="file:/usr/libexec/sudo">/usr/libexec/sudo</a>

       #
       # Core dumps:
       #   Set disable_coredump true|false
       #
       # By default, sudo disables core dumps while it is executing (they
       # are re-enabled for the command that is run).
       # To aid in debugging sudo problems, you may wish to enable core
       # dumps by setting "disable_coredump" to false.
       #
       #Set disable_coredump false

       #
       # User groups:
       #   Set group_source static|dynamic|adaptive
       #
       # Sudo passes the user's group list to the policy plugin.
       # If the user is a member of the maximum number of groups (usually 16),
       # sudo will query the group database directly to be sure to include
       # the full list of groups.
       #
       # On some systems, this can be expensive so the behavior is configurable.
       # The "group_source" setting has three possible values:
       #   static   - use the user's list of groups returned by the kernel.
       #   dynamic  - query the group database to find the list of groups.
       #   adaptive - if user is in less than the maximum number of groups.
       #              use the kernel list, else query the group database.
       #
       #Set group_source static

       #
       # Sudo interface probing:
       #   Set probe_interfaces true|false
       #
       # By default, sudo will probe the system's network interfaces and
       # pass the IP address of each enabled interface to the policy plugin.
       # On systems with a large number of virtual interfaces this may take
       # a noticeable amount of time.
       #
       #Set probe_interfaces false

       #
       # Sudo debug files:
       #   Debug program /path/to/debug_log subsystem@priority[,subsyste@priority]
       #
       # Sudo and related programs support logging debug information to a file.
       # The program is typically sudo, sudoers.so, sudoreplay, or visudo.
       #
       # Subsystems vary based on the program; "all" matches all subsystems.
       # Priority may be crit, err, warn, notice, diag, info, trace, or debug.
       # Multiple subsystem@priority may be specified, separated by a comma.
       #
       #Debug sudo /var/log/sudo_debug all@debug
       #Debug sudoers.so /var/log/sudoers_debug all@debug
