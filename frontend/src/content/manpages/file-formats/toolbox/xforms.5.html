       xforms -   A GUI Toolkit for X Window Systems

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Forms</b>  <b>Library</b> <b>for</b> <b>X</b> (xforms) is a GUI toolkit and builder for the X Window Systems and runs on all major
       UNIX platforms as well as OpenVMS and OS2.  <b>Forms</b> <b>Library</b> is too complex to be  described  in  the  "man"
       page  format.   Ask your system administrator for the location of the HTML, PDF or PostScript document or
       follow the links on the <b>Forms</b> <b>Library</b>'s home page for an online version of the documentation.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Forms</b> <b>Library</b> is a graphical user interface toolkit based on Xlib for X Window Systems. It comes  with  a
       rich  set of objects such as buttons, browsers, sliders and menus integrated into an elegant event/object
       callback execution model that allows fast and easy construction  of  X  applications.  In  addition,  the
       library  has support for image read and write, format conversion and simple image processing. The library
       consists of a flexible set of C-routines that can be used in C and C++  programs  (As  of  this  writing,
       perl, ada95, pascal, scheme and Fortran bindings to the <b>Forms</b> <b>Library</b> are in beta.)

       The  library  is efficient and portable and runs on all major Unix platforms, including Sun, SGI, HP, DEC
       Alpha/OSF,  IBM  RS6000,  Convex,  Cray,  Linux,  FreeBSD,  NetBSD,  SCO,  Unixware,  OpenBSD   ,   BSDi,
       <a href="../manmips/DecSystem.mips.html">DecSystem</a>(mips)/Ultrix and others.  Non-unix platforms include OpenVMS, OS/2, and Window/NT.

       Bundled  with  the library is also a Form designer, <u>fdesign,</u> which can be used to build interaction forms
       in a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) way and to generate  the  corresponding  C  (or  any  of  the
       binding languages) code for you.  50+ demos in source code are distributed with the library.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All programs written using the <b>Forms</b> <b>Library</b> recognize the following command line options

       <b>-display</b> <u>host:dpy</u>
             specifies the server to connect to.

       <b>-bw</b> <u>borderwidth</u>
             specifies the border width to use for built-in objects.

       <b>-flversion</b>
             prints the xforms version information.

       <b>-visual</b> <u>visualName</u>
             requests  a  visual  by name such as TrueColor etc. By default the <b>Forms</b> <b>Library</b> always selects the
             visual that has the most depth.

       <b>-depth</b> <u>depth</u>
             requests a specific depth.

       <b>-fldebug</b> <u>level</u>
             generates some info about the state of the <b>XForms.</b>  where <u>level</u>  is  an  integer  between  1-5  and
             controls  the amount of information to output. Depending on the options used when the <b>Forms</b> <b>Library</b>
             was built, a level more than 3 might not be available.

       <b>-sync</b> runs the application in synchronous mode with debug level set to 4.

       <b>-private</b>
             requests a private colormap for the application.

       <b>-shared</b>
             requests a shared colormap even if the application needs more  colors  than  available.  For  those
             colors  that  can't  be  allocated  in  the  shared colormap, substitutions are made so the closest
             matching color is used.

       <b>-stdcmap</b>
             requests a standard colormap.

       <b>-name</b>  <b>newname</b>
             specifies the application name under which resources are to be obtained, rather  than  the  default
             executable file name.
