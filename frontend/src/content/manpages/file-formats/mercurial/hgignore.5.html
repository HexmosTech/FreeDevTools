       hgignore - syntax for Mercurial ignore files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The  Mercurial  system  uses a file called <b>.hgignore</b> in the root directory of a repository to control its
       behavior when it searches for files that it is not currently tracking.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The working directory of a Mercurial repository will often contain files that should not  be  tracked  by
       Mercurial.  These include backup files created by editors and build products created by compilers.  These
       files can be ignored by listing them in a <b>.hgignore</b> file in  the  root  of  the  working  directory.  The
       <b>.hgignore</b>  file must be created manually. It is typically put under version control, so that the settings
       will propagate to other repositories with push and pull.

       An untracked file is ignored if its path relative to the repository root directory, or any prefix path of
       that path, is matched against any pattern in <b>.hgignore</b>.

       For example, say we have an untracked file, <b>file.c</b>, at <b>a/b/file.c</b> inside our repository.  Mercurial  will
       ignore <b>file.c</b> if any pattern in <b>.hgignore</b> matches <b>a/b/file.c</b>, <b>a/b</b> or <b>a</b>.

       In  addition,  a Mercurial configuration file can reference a set of per-user or global ignore files. See
       the <b>ignore</b> configuration key on the <b>[ui]</b> section of <b>hg</b> <b>help</b> <b>config</b> for details of how to configure  these
       files.

       To  control  Mercurial's  handling of files that it manages, many commands support the <b>-I</b> and <b>-X</b> options;
       see <b>hg</b> <b>help</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> and <b>hg</b> <b>help</b> <b>patterns</b> for details.

       Files that are already tracked are not affected by .hgignore,  even  if  they  appear  in  .hgignore.  An
       untracked  file  X  can  be  explicitly  added with <b>hg</b> <b>add</b> <b>X</b>, even if X would be excluded by a pattern in
       .hgignore.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       An ignore file is a plain text file consisting of a list of patterns, with one pattern  per  line.  Empty
       lines  are  skipped. The <b>#</b> character is treated as a comment character, and the <b>\</b> character is treated as
       an escape character.

       Mercurial supports several pattern  syntaxes.  The  default  syntax  used  is  Python/Perl-style  regular
       expressions.

       To change the syntax used, use a line of the following form:

       syntax: NAME

       where <b>NAME</b> is one of the following:

       <b>regexp</b>

              Regular expression, Python/Perl syntax.

       <b>glob</b>

              Shell-style glob.

       <b>rootglob</b>

              A variant of <b>glob</b> that is rooted (see below).

       The  chosen  syntax  stays  in  effect  when  parsing  all  patterns that follow, until another syntax is
       selected.

       Neither <b>glob</b> nor regexp patterns are rooted. A glob-syntax pattern of the form  <b>*.c</b>  will  match  a  file
       ending  in  <b>.c</b> in any directory, and a regexp pattern of the form <b>\.c$</b> will do the same. To root a regexp
       pattern, start it with <b>^</b>. To get the same effect with glob-syntax, you have to use <b>rootglob</b>.

       Subdirectories can have their own .hgignore settings by adding <b>subinclude:path/to/subdir/.hgignore</b> to the
       root <b>.hgignore</b>. See <b>hg</b> <b>help</b> <b>patterns</b> for details on <b>subinclude:</b> and <b>include:</b>.

       Note   Patterns specified in other than <b>.hgignore</b> are always rooted.  Please  see  <b>hg</b>  <b>help</b>  <b>patterns</b> for
              details.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Here is an example ignore file.

       # use glob syntax.
       syntax: glob

       *.elc
       *.pyc
       *~

       # switch to regexp syntax.
       syntax: regexp
       ^\.pc/

</pre><h4><b>DEBUGGING</b></h4><pre>
       Use  the  <b>debugignore</b> command to see if and why a file is ignored, or to see the combined ignore pattern.
       See <b>hg</b> <b>help</b> <b>debugignore</b> for details.
