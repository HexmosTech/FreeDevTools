</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>account-server.conf</b> - configuration file for the OpenStack Swift account server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>account-server.conf</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the configuration file used by the account server and other account background services, such as;
       replicator, auditor and reaper.

       The  configuration  file  follows the python-pastedeploy syntax. The file is divided into sections, which
       are enclosed by square brackets. Each section will contain a certain number of key/value parameters which
       are described later.

       Any line that begins with a '#' symbol is ignored.

       You    can    find    more    information    about    python-pastedeploy    configuration    format    at
       <u>https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pastedeploy/en/latest/#config-format</u>

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  indicated  by section named [DEFAULT]. Below are the parameters that are acceptable within this
       section.

       <b>bind_ip</b>
              IP address the account server should bind to. The default is 0.0.0.0 which will make  it  bind  to
              all available addresses.

       <b>bind_port</b>
              TCP port the account server should bind to. The default is 6202.

       <b>keep_idle</b>
              Value to set for socket TCP_KEEPIDLE. The default value is 600.

       <b>bind_timeout</b>
              Timeout to bind socket. The default is 30.

       <b>backlog</b>

       <b>workers</b>
              The number of pre-forked processes that will accept connections.  Zero means no fork.  The default
              is  auto  which  will  make  the  server  try to match the number of effective cpu cores if python
              multiprocessing is available (included with most python distributions &gt;= 2.6) or fallback to  one.
              It's  worth  noting that individual workers will use many eventlet co-routines to service multiple
              concurrent requests.

       <b>max_clients</b>
              Maximum number of clients one worker can process simultaneously (it will actually  <a href="../man2/accept.2.html">accept</a>(2)  N  +
              1).  Setting  this  to  one  (1) will only handle one request at a time, without accepting another
              request concurrently.  The default is 1024.

</pre><h4><b>PIPELINE</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is indicated by section name [pipeline:main]. Below are the parameters that  are  acceptable  within
       this section.

       <b>pipeline</b>
              It  is  used  when  you  need  apply  a  number  of  filters.  It is a list of filters ended by an
              application. The normal pipeline is "healthcheck recon account-server".

</pre><h4><b>APP</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is indicated by section name [app:account-server]. Below are  the  parameters  that  are  acceptable

              Configure  parameter  for  creating  specific  server.  To handle all verbs, including replication
              verbs, do not specify "replication_server" (this is the default). To only handle replication,  set
              to a true value (e.g. "true" or "1"). To handle only non-replication verbs, set to "false". Unless
              you   have   a   separate   replication   network,   you   should   not   specify  any  value  for
              "replication_server". The default is empty.

       <b>nice_priority</b>

              ionice_class.  Ignored if IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE is set.

</pre><h4><b>FILTER</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       Any  section  that  has  its  name prefixed by "filter:" indicates a filter section.  Filters are used to
       specify configuration parameters for specific swift middlewares.  Below are  the  filters  available  and
       respective acceptable parameters.

       <b>[filter:healthcheck]</b>

          <b>use</b>    Entry  point  for  paste.deploy  for  the  healthcheck middleware. This is the reference to the
                 installed python egg.  This is normally <b>egg:swift#healthcheck</b>.

          <b>disable_path</b>
                 An optional filesystem path which, if present, will cause the healthcheck URL  to  return  "503
                 Service Unavailable" with a body of "DISABLED BY FILE".

       <b>[filter:recon]</b>

          <b>use</b>    Entry  point  for paste.deploy for the recon middleware. This is the reference to the installed
                 python egg.  This is normally <b>egg:swift#recon</b>.

          <b>recon_cache_path</b>
                 The recon_cache_path simply sets the directory where stats for a  few  items  will  be  stored.
                 Depending on the method of deployment you may need to create this directory manually and ensure
                 that swift has read/write. The default is /var/cache/swift.

       <b>[filter:xprofile]</b>

          <b>use</b>    Entry  point  for  paste.deploy  for  the  xprofile  middleware.  This  is the reference to the
                 installed python egg.  This is normally <b>egg:swift#xprofile</b>.

          <b>profile_module</b>
                 This option enable you to switch profilers which should inherit from python standard  profiler.
                 Currently the supported value can be 'cProfile', 'eventlet.green.profile' etc.

          <b>log_filename_prefix</b>
                 This  prefix  will  be  used to combine process ID and timestamp to name the profile data file.
                 Make sure the executing user has permission to write into this path (missing path segments will
                 be created, if necessary).  If you enable profiling in more than one type of daemon,  you  must
                 override it with an unique value like, the default is /var/log/swift/profile/account.profile.

          <b>dump_interval</b>
                 The  profile data will be dumped to local disk based on above naming rule in this interval. The
                 default is 5.0.

          <b>dump_timestamp</b>
                 Be careful, this option will enable profiler to dump data into the file with time  stamp  which
                 means there will be lots of files piled up in the directory.  The default is false

          <b>path</b>   This is the path of the URL to access the mini web UI. The default is __profile__.

          <b>flush_at_shutdown</b>
                 Clear the data when the wsgi server shutdown. The default is false.

          <b>unwind</b> Unwind the iterator of applications. Default is false.

                 removed.

          <b>reap_warn_after</b>
                 If the account fails to be reaped due to a persistent error, the  account  reaper  will  log  a

                 days). This is in addition to any time requested by delay_reaping.

          <b>nice_priority</b>
                 Modify  scheduling priority of server processes. Niceness values range from -20 (most favorable
                 to the process) to 19 (least favorable to the process).  The default does not modify priority.

          <b>ionice_class</b>
                 Modify I/O scheduling class of server processes. I/O niceness class values are  IOPRIO_CLASS_RT
                 (realtime),  IOPRIO_CLASS_BE  (best-effort) and IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE (idle).  The default does not
                 modify class and priority.  Work only with ionice_priority.

          <b>ionice_priority</b>
                 Modify I/O scheduling priority of server processes. I/O niceness priority  is  a  number  which
                 goes  from  0  to 7. The higher the value, the lower the I/O priority of the process. Work only
                 with ionice_class.  Ignored if IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE is set.
