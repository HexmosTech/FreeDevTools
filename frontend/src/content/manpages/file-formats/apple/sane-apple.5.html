</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-apple - SANE backend for Apple flatbed scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-apple</b> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to Apple
       flatbed scanners. At present, the following scanners are supported from this backend:

       --------------- ----- ------------------ ------
       AppleScanner    4bit  16 Shades of Gray
       OneScanner      8bit  256 Shades of Gray
       ColorOneScanner 24bit RGB color          3-pass

       If you own a Apple scanner other than the ones listed above that works with this backend, please  let  us
       know  by  sending  the  scanner's  model  name,  SCSI  id,  and  firmware  revision to <u>sane-devel@alioth-</u>
       <u>lists.debian.net</u>.  See <u><a href="http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html">http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html</a></u> for details on how to subscribe  to
       sane-devel.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              <u>special</u>

       where  <u>special</u>  is  the  path-name  for  the  special device that corresponds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI
       scanners, the special device name must be a generic SCSI device or a symlink to  such  a  device.   Under
       Linux, such a device name could be <u>/dev/sga</u> or <u>/dev/sge</u>, for example.  See <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5) for details.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>apple.conf</u> file is a list of options and device names that correspond to Apple scanners.  Empty lines
       and  lines  starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  See <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5) on details of what constitutes a
       valid device name.

       Options come in two flavors: global and positional ones.  Global options apply to all devices managed  by
       the backend, whereas positional options apply just to the most recently mentioned device.  Note that this
       means that the order in which the options appear matters!

</pre><h4><b>SCSI</b> <b>ADAPTER</b> <b>TIPS</b></h4><pre>
       SCSI scanners are typically delivered with an ISA SCSI adapter.  Unfortunately, that adapter is not worth
       much  since  it  is not interrupt driven.  It is sometimes possible to get the supplied card to work, but
       without an interrupt line, scanning will put so much load on the system that it becomes  almost  unusable
       for other tasks.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/apple.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file (see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-apple.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-apple.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This  environment  variable  is a list of directories where SANE looks for the configuration file.
              On *NIX systems, directory names are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2 by a semi-colon (`;').
              If SANE_CONFIG_DIR is not set, SANE defaults to searching the current working directory (".")  and
              then <u>/etc/sane.d</u>.  If the value of $SANE_CONFIG_DIR ends with the separator character, the default
              directories  are  searched  after  the  directory  list.   For example, setting <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to
              "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being searched (in  that
              order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_APPLE</b>
              Controls  the  debug  level.   A  value  of  255  prints  all debug output.  Smaller values reduce
              verbosity.  Requires a library compiled with debug support.

</pre><h4><b>CURRENT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The apple backend is now in version 0.3 (Tue Jul 21 1998). Since I only have the AppleScanner and not the
       other models (OneScanner, ColorOneScanner) I can only  develop/test  for  the  AppleScanner  effectively.
       However  with this release I almost completed the GUI part of all scanners.  Most of the functionality is
       there. At least OneScanner should  scan  at  the  AppleScanner's  compatible  modes  (LineArt,  HalfTone,
       Gray16).  My  personal  belief  is that with a slight touch of debugging the OneScanner could be actually
       usable. The ColorOneScanner needs more work. AppleScanner is of course almost fully supported.

</pre><h4><b>MISSING</b> <b>FUNCTIONALITY</b></h4><pre>
       Currently all three models lack upload/download support.

       <b>AppleScanner</b>
              Cannot up/download a halftone pattern.

       <b>OneScanner</b>
              Cannot up/download halftone patterns or calibration vectors.

       <b>ColorOneScanner</b>
              Cannot up/download halftone patterns, calibration vectors, custom Color  Correction  Tables  (CCT)
              and of course custom gamma tables.

       <b>Park/UnPark</b> <b>(OneScanner,</b> <b>ColorOneScanner)</b>
              Some capabilities are missing.

       The above functionalities are missing because I don't have the hardware to experiment on.  Another reason
       is my lack of understanding as to how or if the SANE API provide means to describe any array type besides
       gamma.

</pre><h4><b>UNSUPPORTED</b> <b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       The following "features" will never be supported, at least while I maintain the sane-apple backend.

       <b>NoHome</b> <b>(AppleScanner)</b>
              The scanner lamp stays on and the carriage assembly remains where it stops at the end of the scan.
              After two minutes, if the scanner does not receive another SCAN command, the lamp goes off and the
              carriage returns to the home position.

       <b>Compression</b> <b>(AppleScanner)</b>
              The  Scanner  can  compress data with CCITT Group III one dimensional algorithm (fax) and the Skip
              White Line algorithm.

       <b>Multiple</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>(AppleScanner)</b>
              AppleScanner may support multiple windows. It would be a cool feature and a challenge  for  me  to
              code  if it could intermix different options for different windows (scan areas). This way it could
              scan a document in LineArt mode but the figures in it in  Gray  and  at  a  different  resolution.
              Unfortunately this is impossible.

       <b>Scan</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>(OneScanner)</b>
              It controls the scan direction. (?)

       <b>Status/Reset</b> <b>Button</b> <b>(OneScanner)</b>
              This  option  controls  the  status  of the button on the OneScanner model. You can also reset the
              button status by software.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       SANE backend bugs are divided in two classes. We have <b>GUI</b> bugs and <b>scanner</b> <b>specific</b> bugs.

       We know we have a GUI bug when a parameter is not showing up when  it  should  (active)  or  vice  versa.
       Finding  out  which parameters are active across various Apple modes and models from the documentation is
       an interesting exercise. I may have missed some dependencies. For example of the threshold parameter  the
       Apple Scanners Programming Guide says nothing. I had to assume it is valid only in LineArt mode.

       Scanner  specific  bugs  are mostly due to mandatory round-offs in order to scan. In the documentation in
       one place states that the width of the scan area should be a byte multiple. In another place it says that
       the width of the scan area should be an even byte multiple. Go figure...

       Other sources of bugs are due to scsi communication, scsi connects and disconnects. However the classical
       bugs are still there. So you may encounter buffer overruns, null pointers, memory corruption and <b>SANE</b> API
       violations.

       <b>SIGSEGV</b> <b>on</b> <b>SliceBars</b>
              When you try to modify the scan area from the slice bar you have a nice little cute core  dump.  I
              don't  know why. If you select the scan area from the preview window or by hand typing the numbers
              everything is fine. The SIGSEGV happens deep in gtk library (gdk). I really cannot debug it.

       <b>Options</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b>
              It is possible, especially for the ColorOneScanner, for the  backend's  options  panel  to  extend
              beyond your screen. It happens with mine and I am running my X Server at 1024x768. What can I say?
              Try smaller fonts in the X server, or virtual screens.

       <b>Weird</b> <b>SCSI</b> <b>behaviour</b>
              I am quoting David Myers Here...

              &gt;&gt; OS: FreeBSD 2.2.6
              &gt;&gt; CC: egcs-1.02
              Just  wanted to follow up on this...  I recently changed my SCSI card from the Adaptec 2940UW to a
              dual-channel Symbios 786 chipset.  When I started up SANE with your driver, I managed to scan line
              art drawings okay, but Gray16 scans led to a  stream  of  SCSI  error  messages  on  the  console,
              ultimately  hanging  with a message saying the scanner wasn't releasing the SCSI bus.  This may be
              that the Symbios is simply less tolerant of ancient hardware, or may be bugs in your driver or  in
              SANE itself...

</pre><h4><b>DEBUG</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  encounter  a GUI bug please set the environmental variable <b>SANE_DEBUG_APPLE</b> to 255 and rerun the
       exact sequence of keystrokes and menu selections to reproduce it. Then send me  a  report  with  the  log
       attached.

       If you have an Apple Macintosh with the AppleScanners driver installed, reporting to me which options are
       grayed out (inactive) in what modes would be very helpful.

       If  you  want to offer some help but you don't have a scanner, or you don't have the model you would like
       to help with, or you are a SANE developer and you just want to take a look at how the apple backend looks
       like, goto to <u>apple.h</u> and #define the <b>NEUTRALIZE_BACKEND</b> macro. You can select the scanner model  through
       the <b>APPLE_MODEL_SELECT</b> macro. Available options are <b>APPLESCANNER</b>, <b>ONESCANNER</b>, and <b>COLORONESCANNER</b>.

       If  you encounter a SCSI bus error or trimmed and/or displaced images please set the environment variable
       <b>SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI</b> to 255 before sending me the report.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Non</b> <b>Blocking</b> <b>Support</b>
              Make   <b>sane-apple</b>   a   non   blocking   backend.   Properly   support   <b>sane_set_io_mode</b>()    and
              <b>sane_get_select_fd</b>().

       <b>Scan</b>   Make scanning possible for all models in all supported modes.

       Add other missing functionality.
