       mh-draft - draft folder facility for nmh message system

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       There are a number of interesting advanced facilities for the composition of outgoing mail.

   <b>The</b> <b>Draft</b> <b>Folder</b>
       The  <b>comp</b>,  <b>dist</b>,  <b>forw</b>,  <b>repl</b>,  <b>send</b>,  and <b>whom</b> commands each take the switches <b>-draftfolder</b> <u>+folder</u> and
       <b>-draftmessage</b> <u>msg</u>, which allow you to manipulate the various draft messages you are composing.

       If <b>-draftfolder</b> <u>+folder</u> is used, draft messages  will  be  constructed  in  the  indicated  folder.   The
       “<u>Draft-Folder</u>” profile entry may be used to specify a default draft folder.

       If  the  switch  <b>-draftmessage</b>  <u>msg</u>  is  given,  the  specified draft is used to compose the message.  If
       <b>-draftmessage</b> <u>msg</u> is not used, then the draft defaults to `new' (create a  new  draft)  unless  the  user
       invokes <b>comp</b> with <b>-use</b>, in which case the default is `cur'.

       Hence,  the  user  may have several message compositions in progress simultaneously.  Now, all of the <b>nmh</b>
       tools are available on each of the user's message drafts (e.g.  <b>show</b>, <b>scan</b>, <b>pick</b>, and  so  on).   If  the
       folder does not exist, the user is asked if it should be created (just like with <b>refile</b>).  The last draft
       message the user was composing is known as `cur' in the draft folder.

       Using  <b>send</b>,  the  user can send drafts using the standard <b>nmh</b> `msgs' convention with <b>-draftmessage</b> <u>msgs</u>.
       If no `msgs' are given, it defaults to `cur'.

       In addition, all of these programs have a <b>-nodraftfolder</b> switch, which  undoes  the  last  occurrence  of
       <b>-draftfolder</b> <u>folder</u> (useful if a default is specified in the user's <b>nmh</b> profile).

       If  the user does not give the <b>-draftfolder</b> <u>+folder</u> switch, then all these commands act “normally”.  Note
       that the <b>-draft</b> switch to <b>send</b> and <b>show</b> still refers to  the  file  called  `draft'  in  the  user's  <b>nmh</b>
       directory.   In  the interests of economy of expression, when using <b>comp</b> or <b>send</b>, the user needn't prefix
       the draft `msg' or `msgs' with <b>-draftmessage</b>.  Both of these commands accept a `file' or `files' argument
       and they will, if given <b>-draftfolder</b> <u>+folder</u>, treat these arguments as `msg' or `msgs'.  (This may appear
       to be inconsistent, at first, but it saves a lot of typing.)  Hence,

              send -draftfolder +drafts first

       is the same as

              send -draftfolder +drafts -draftmessage first

       To make all this a bit more clear, here are some examples.  Let's assume that the following  entries  are
       in the <b>nmh</b> profile:

            Draft-Folder: drafts
            sendf: -draftfolder +drafts

       Furthermore,  let's assume that the program <b>sendf</b> is a (symbolic) link in the user's <u>$HOME/bin/</u> directory
       to <b>send</b>.  Now,

            comp
            dist
            forw
            repl

       will construct the message draft in the `drafts' folder using the  `new'  message  number.   Furthermore,
       they  each define `cur' in this folder to be that message draft.  If the user were to use the <b>quit</b> option
       at the `What now?' prompt, then later on, if no other draft composition was done, the draft could be sent
       with simply

            sendf

       Or, if more editing was required, the draft could be edited with

            comp -use

       If other drafts had been composed in the meantime, so that this message draft  was  no  longer  known  as
       `cur'  in  the  `draft'  folder, then the user could <b>scan</b> the folder to see which message draft should be
       used for editing or sending.  Clever users could even employ a backquoted <b>pick</b> to do the work:

            comp -use `pick +drafts -to nmh-workers`

       or

            sendf `pick +drafts -to nmh-workers`

       Note that in the <b>comp</b> example, the output from <b>pick</b> must resolve to a single message draft (it  makes  no
       sense  to talk about composing two or more drafts with one invocation of <b>comp</b>).  In contrast, in the <b>send</b>
       example, as many message drafts as desired can appear, since <b>send</b> doesn't  mind  sending  more  than  one
       draft at a time.

       Note  that  the  argument  <b>-draftfolder</b> <u>+folder</u> is not included in the profile entry for <b>send</b>, since when
       <b>comp</b>, et al, invoke <b>send</b> directly, they supply <b>send</b> with the Unix pathname of the message  draft;  <u>not</u>  a
       <b>-draftmessage</b> <u>msg</u> argument.  As far as <b>send</b> is concerned, a draft folder is not being used.

       It  is  important  to  realize  that <b>nmh</b> treats the draft folder like a standard <b>nmh</b> folder in nearly all
       respects.  There are two exceptions:

       First, under no circumstances will the <b>-draftfolder</b> <u>folder</u> switch cause the named folder  to  become  the
       current  folder.   Obviously,  if the folder appeared in the context of a standard <u>+folder</u> argument to an
       <b>nmh</b> program, as in

            scan +drafts

       it might become the current folder, depending on the context changes of the <b>nmh</b> program in question.

       Second, although conceptually <b>send</b> deletes the `msgs' named  in  the  draft  folder,  it  does  not  call
       <u>delete-prog</u> to perform the deletion.

   <b>What</b> <b>Happens</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Draft</b> <b>Exists</b>
       When  the  <b>comp</b>,  <b>dist</b>,  <b>forw</b>,  and <b>repl</b> commands are invoked and the draft you indicated already exists,
       these programs will prompt the user for a response directing the program's action.  The prompt is

            Draft "/home/foobar/nmhbox/draft" exists (xx bytes).
            Disposition?

       The appropriate responses and their meanings are:

            <b>replace</b>   deletes the draft and starts afresh
            <b>list</b>      lists the draft
            <b>refile</b>    files the draft into a folder and starts afresh
            <b>quit</b>      leaves the draft intact and exits

       In addition, if you specified <b>-draftfolder</b> <u>folder</u> to  the  command,  then  one  other  response  will  be
       accepted:

            <b>new</b>       creates a new draft

       just as if <b>-draftmessage</b> <u>new</u> had been given.  Finally, the <b>comp</b> command will accept one more response:

            <b>use</b>       re-uses the draft

       just as if <b>-use</b> had been given.
