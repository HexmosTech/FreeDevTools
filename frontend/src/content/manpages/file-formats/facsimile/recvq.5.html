       recvq/fax* - received facsimile document format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Facsimile received by <u>HylaFAX</u> are placed in the <b>recvq</b> subdirectory.  Each facsimile document is stored as
       a single Class F Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) file.  This format includes the following information:
              • page width and length
              • horizontal and vertical resolution
              • page orientation
              • phone number of the sender
              • date and time document was received
              • number of scanlines received with errors
              • maximum number of consecutive scanlines received with errors
              • whether or not bad scanlines were regenerated by the receiver
              • make and model of the modem used to receive the document
              • name of the host computer on which the document was received

       Image  data is written using either CCITT T.4 or CCITT T.6 compression.  By default data is written using
       the compression scheme/data format negotiated by the sender and receiver.   However,  if  <u><a href="../man8/faxgetty.8.html">faxgetty</a></u>(8)  is
       configured  to  do copy quality checking then data is written using the compression scheme defined by the
       <b>RecvDataFormat</b> configuration parameter; see <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-config.5.html">hylafax-config</a></u>(5).

       A scanline that is regenerated by the receiver because of an error  is  typically  just  a  copy  of  the
       previous good scanline.

       The  files  in  the  <b>recvq</b>  directory  are  created  with  the  protection  mode  specified in the server
       configuration file(s).  By default, files are created with mode 0600 and owned by  the  <u>fax</u>  user,  which
       means that they are accessible only to the fax user.

       To print a facsimile on a POSTSCRIPT® printer, the <u><a href="../man1/fax2ps.1.html">fax2ps</a></u>(1) program can be used.
