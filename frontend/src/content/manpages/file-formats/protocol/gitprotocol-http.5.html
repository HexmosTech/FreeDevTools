</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gitprotocol-http - Git HTTP-based protocols

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       &lt;over-the-wire-protocol&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Git supports two HTTP based transfer protocols. A "dumb" protocol which requires only a standard HTTP
       server on the server end of the connection, and a "smart" protocol which requires a Git aware CGI (or
       server module). This document describes both protocols.

       As a design feature smart clients can automatically upgrade "dumb" protocol URLs to smart URLs. This
       permits all users to have the same published URL, and the peers automatically select the most efficient
       transport available to them.

</pre><h4><b>URL</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       URLs for Git repositories accessed by HTTP use the standard HTTP URL syntax documented by RFC 1738, so
       they are of the form:

           http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;?&lt;searchpart&gt;

       Within this documentation the placeholder <b>$GIT_URL</b> will stand for the http:// repository URL entered by
       the end-user.

       Servers SHOULD handle all requests to locations matching <b>$GIT_URL</b>, as both the "smart" and "dumb" HTTP
       protocols used by Git operate by appending additional path components onto the end of the user supplied
       <b>$GIT_URL</b> string.

       An example of a dumb client requesting a loose object:

           $GIT_URL:     <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>:8080/git/repo.git
           URL request:  <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>:8080/git/repo.git/objects/d0/49f6c27a2244e12041955e262a404c7faba355

       An example of a smart request to a catch-all gateway:

           $GIT_URL:     <a href="http://example.com/daemon.cgi">http://example.com/daemon.cgi</a>?svc=git&amp;q=
           URL request:  <a href="http://example.com/daemon.cgi">http://example.com/daemon.cgi</a>?svc=git&amp;q=/info/refs&amp;service=git-receive-pack

       An example of a request to a submodule:

           $GIT_URL:     <a href="http://example.com/git/repo.git/path/submodule.git">http://example.com/git/repo.git/path/submodule.git</a>
           URL request:  <a href="http://example.com/git/repo.git/path/submodule.git/info/refs">http://example.com/git/repo.git/path/submodule.git/info/refs</a>

       Clients MUST strip a trailing <b>/</b>, if present, from the user supplied <b>$GIT_URL</b> string to prevent empty path
       tokens (<b>//</b>) from appearing in any URL sent to a server. Compatible clients MUST expand <b>$GIT_URL/info/refs</b>
       as <b>foo/info/refs</b> and not <b>foo//info/refs</b>.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHENTICATION</b></h4><pre>
       Standard HTTP authentication is used if authentication is required to access a repository, and MAY be
       configured and enforced by the HTTP server software.

       Because Git repositories are accessed by standard path components server administrators MAY use directory
       based permissions within their HTTP server to control repository access.

       Clients SHOULD support Basic authentication as described by RFC 2617. Servers SHOULD support Basic
       authentication by relying upon the HTTP server placed in front of the Git server software.

       Servers SHOULD NOT require HTTP cookies for the purposes of authentication or access control.

       Clients and servers MAY support other common forms of HTTP based authentication, such as Digest
       authentication.

</pre><h4><b>SSL</b></h4><pre>
       Clients and servers SHOULD support SSL, particularly to protect passwords when relying on Basic HTTP
       authentication.

</pre><h4><b>SESSION</b> <b>STATE</b></h4><pre>
       The Git over HTTP protocol (much like HTTP itself) is stateless from the perspective of the HTTP server
       side. All state MUST be retained and managed by the client process. This permits simple round-robin
       load-balancing on the server side, without needing to worry about state management.

       Clients MUST NOT require state management on the server side in order to function correctly.

       Servers MUST NOT require HTTP cookies in order to function correctly. Clients MAY store and forward HTTP
       cookies during request processing as described by RFC 2616 (HTTP/1.1). Servers SHOULD ignore any cookies
       sent by a client.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>REQUEST</b> <b>PROCESSING</b></h4><pre>
       Except where noted, all standard HTTP behavior SHOULD be assumed by both client and server. This includes
       (but is not necessarily limited to):

       If there is no repository at <b>$GIT_URL</b>, or the resource pointed to by a location matching <b>$GIT_URL</b> does
       not exist, the server MUST NOT respond with <b>200</b> <b>OK</b> response. A server SHOULD respond with <b>404</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Found</b>,
       <b>410</b> <b>Gone</b>, or any other suitable HTTP status code which does not imply the resource exists as requested.

       If there is a repository at <b>$GIT_URL</b>, but access is not currently permitted, the server MUST respond with
       the <b>403</b> <b>Forbidden</b> HTTP status code.

       Servers SHOULD support both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1. Servers SHOULD support chunked encoding for both
       request and response bodies.

       Clients SHOULD support both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1. Clients SHOULD support chunked encoding for both
       request and response bodies.

       Servers MAY return ETag and/or Last-Modified headers.

       Clients MAY revalidate cached entities by including If-Modified-Since and/or If-None-Match request
       headers.

       Servers MAY return <b>304</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Modified</b> if the relevant headers appear in the request and the entity has not
       changed. Clients MUST treat <b>304</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Modified</b> identical to <b>200</b> <b>OK</b> by reusing the cached entity.

       Clients MAY reuse a cached entity without revalidation if the Cache-Control and/or Expires header permits
       caching. Clients and servers MUST follow RFC 2616 for cache controls.

</pre><h4><b>DISCOVERING</b> <b>REFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       All HTTP clients MUST begin either a fetch or a push exchange by discovering the references available on
       the remote repository.

   <b>Dumb</b> <b>Clients</b>
       HTTP clients that only support the "dumb" protocol MUST discover references by making a request for the
       special info/refs file of the repository.

       Dumb HTTP clients MUST make a <b>GET</b> request to <b>$GIT_URL/info/refs</b>, without any search/query parameters.

           C: GET $GIT_URL/info/refs HTTP/1.0

           S: 200 OK
           S:
           S: 95dcfa3633004da0049d3d0fa03f80589cbcaf31  refs/heads/maint
           S: d049f6c27a2244e12041955e262a404c7faba355  refs/heads/master

           S: a3c2e2402b99163d1d59756e5f207ae21cccba4c  refs/tags/v1.0^{}

       The Content-Type of the returned info/refs entity SHOULD be <b>text/plain</b>; <b>charset=utf-8</b>, but MAY be any
       content type. Clients MUST NOT attempt to validate the returned Content-Type. Dumb servers MUST NOT
       return a return type starting with <b>application/x-git-</b>.

       Cache-Control headers MAY be returned to disable caching of the returned entity.

       When examining the response clients SHOULD only examine the HTTP status code. Valid responses are <b>200</b> <b>OK</b>,
       or <b>304</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Modified</b>.

       The returned content is a UNIX formatted text file describing each ref and its known value. The file
       SHOULD be sorted by name according to the C locale ordering. The file SHOULD NOT include the default ref
       named <b>HEAD</b>.

           info_refs   =  *( ref_record )
           ref_record  =  any_ref / peeled_ref

           any_ref     =  obj-id HTAB refname LF
           peeled_ref  =  obj-id HTAB refname LF
                          obj-id HTAB refname "^{}" LF

   <b>Smart</b> <b>Clients</b>
       HTTP clients that support the "smart" protocol (or both the "smart" and "dumb" protocols) MUST discover
       references by making a parameterized request for the info/refs file of the repository.

       The request MUST contain exactly one query parameter, <b>service=$servicename</b>, where <b>$servicename</b> MUST be
       the service name the client wishes to contact to complete the operation. The request MUST NOT contain
       additional query parameters.

           C: GET $GIT_URL/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack HTTP/1.0

       The client may send Extra Parameters (see <b><a href="../man5/gitprotocol-pack.5.html">gitprotocol-pack</a></b>(5)) as a colon-separated string in the
       Git-Protocol HTTP header.

       Uses the <b>--http-backend-info-refs</b> option to <b><a href="../man1/git-upload-pack.1.html">git-upload-pack</a></b>(1).

       <b>Dumb</b> <b>Server</b> <b>Response</b>

           Dumb servers MUST respond with the dumb server reply format.

           See the prior section under dumb clients for a more detailed description of the dumb server response.

       <b>Smart</b> <b>Server</b> <b>Response</b>

           If the server does not recognize the requested service name, or the requested service name has been
           disabled by the server administrator, the server MUST respond with the <b>403</b> <b>Forbidden</b> HTTP status
           code.

           Otherwise, smart servers MUST respond with the smart server reply format for the requested service
           name.

           Cache-Control headers SHOULD be used to disable caching of the returned entity.

           The Content-Type MUST be <b>application/x-$servicename-advertisement</b>. Clients SHOULD fall back to the
           dumb protocol if another content type is returned. When falling back to the dumb protocol clients
           SHOULD NOT make an additional request to <b>$GIT_URL/info/refs</b>, but instead SHOULD use the response
           already in hand. Clients MUST NOT continue if they do not support the dumb protocol.

           Clients MUST validate the status code is either <b>200</b> <b>OK</b> or <b>304</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Modified</b>.

           Clients MUST validate the first five bytes of the response entity matches the regex <b>^</b>[<b>0-9a-f</b>]{4}#. If
           this test fails, clients MUST NOT continue.

           Clients MUST parse the entire response as a sequence of pkt-line records.

           Clients MUST verify the first pkt-line is # <b>service=$servicename</b>. Servers MUST set $servicename to be
           the request parameter value. Servers SHOULD include an LF at the end of this line. Clients MUST
           ignore an LF at the end of the line.

           Servers MUST terminate the response with the magic <b>0000</b> end pkt-line marker.

           The returned response is a pkt-line stream describing each ref and its known value. The stream SHOULD
           be sorted by name according to the C locale ordering. The stream SHOULD include the default ref named
           <b>HEAD</b> as the first ref. The stream MUST include capability declarations behind a NUL on the first ref.

           The returned response contains "version 1" if "version=1" was sent as an Extra Parameter.

               smart_reply     =  PKT-LINE("# service=$servicename" LF)
                                  "0000"
                                  *1("version 1")
                                  ref_list
                                  "0000"
               ref_list        =  empty_list / non_empty_list

               empty_list      =  PKT-LINE(zero-id SP "capabilities^{}" NUL cap-list LF)

               non_empty_list  =  PKT-LINE(obj-id SP name NUL cap_list LF)
                                  *ref_record

               cap-list        =  capability *(SP capability)
               capability      =  1*(LC_ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_")
               LC_ALPHA        =  %x61-7A

               ref_record      =  any_ref / peeled_ref
               any_ref         =  PKT-LINE(obj-id SP name LF)
               peeled_ref      =  PKT-LINE(obj-id SP name LF)
                                  PKT-LINE(obj-id SP name "^{}" LF

</pre><h4><b>SMART</b> <b>SERVICE</b> <b>GIT-UPLOAD-PACK</b></h4><pre>
       This service reads from the repository pointed to by <b>$GIT_URL</b>.

       Clients MUST first perform ref discovery with <b>$GIT_URL/info/refs</b>?service=git-upload-pack.

           C: POST $GIT_URL/git-upload-pack HTTP/1.0

       Clients MUST NOT reuse or revalidate a cached response. Servers MUST include sufficient Cache-Control
       headers to prevent caching of the response.

       Servers SHOULD support all capabilities defined here.

       Clients MUST send at least one "want" command in the request body. Clients MUST NOT reference an id in a
       "want" command which did not appear in the response obtained through ref discovery unless the server
       advertises capability <b>allow-tip-sha1-in-want</b> or <b>allow-reachable-sha1-in-want</b>.

           compute_request   =  want_list
                                have_list
                                request_end
           request_end       =  "0000" / "done"

       TODO: Document this further.

   <b>The</b> <b>Negotiation</b> <b>Algorithm</b>
       The computation to select the minimal pack proceeds as follows (C = client, S = server):

       <u>init</u> <u>step:</u>

       C: Use ref discovery to obtain the advertised refs.

       C: Place any object seen into set <b>advertised</b>.

       C: Build an empty set, <b>common</b>, to hold the objects that are later determined to be on both ends.

       C: Build a set, <b>want</b>, of the objects from <b>advertised</b> that the client wants to fetch, based on what it saw
       during ref discovery.

       C: Start a queue, <b>c_pending</b>, ordered by commit time (popping newest first). Add all client refs. When a
       commit is popped from the queue its parents SHOULD be automatically inserted back. Commits MUST only
       enter the queue once.

       <u>one</u> <u>compute</u> <u>step:</u>

       C: Send one <b>$GIT_URL/git-upload-pack</b> request:

           C: 0032want &lt;want-#1&gt;...............................
           C: 0032want &lt;want-#2&gt;...............................
           ....
           C: 0032have &lt;common-#1&gt;.............................
           C: 0032have &lt;common-#2&gt;.............................
           ....
           C: 0032have &lt;have-#1&gt;...............................
           C: 0032have &lt;have-#2&gt;...............................
           ....
           C: 0000

       The stream is organized into "commands", with each command appearing by itself in a pkt-line. Within a
       command line, the text leading up to the first space is the command name, and the remainder of the line
       to the first LF is the value. Command lines are terminated with an LF as the last byte of the pkt-line
       value.

       Commands MUST appear in the following order, if they appear at all in the request stream:

       •   "want"

       •   "have"

       The stream is terminated by a pkt-line flush (<b>0000</b>).

       A single "want" or "have" command MUST have one hex formatted object name as its value. Multiple object
       names MUST be sent by sending multiple commands. Object names MUST be given using the object format
       negotiated through the <b>object-format</b> capability (default SHA-1).

       The <b>have</b> list is created by popping the first 32 commits from <b>c_pending</b>. Fewer can be supplied if
       <b>c_pending</b> empties.

       If the client has sent 256 "have" commits and has not yet received one of those back from <b>s_common</b>, or
       the client has emptied <b>c_pending</b> it SHOULD include a "done" command to let the server know it won’t
       proceed:

           C: 0009done

       S: Parse the git-upload-pack request:

       Verify all objects in <b>want</b> are directly reachable from refs.

       The server MAY walk backwards through history or through the reflog to permit slightly stale requests.

       If no "want" objects are received, send an error: TODO: Define error if no "want" lines are requested.

       If any "want" object is not reachable, send an error: TODO: Define error if an invalid "want" is
       requested.

       Create an empty list, <b>s_common</b>.

       If "have" was sent:

       Loop through the objects in the order supplied by the client.

       For each object, if the server has the object reachable from a ref, add it to <b>s_common</b>. If a commit is
       added to <b>s_common</b>, do not add any ancestors, even if they also appear in <b>have</b>.

       S: Send the git-upload-pack response:

       If the server has found a closed set of objects to pack or the request ends with "done", it replies with
       the pack. TODO: Document the pack based response

           S: PACK...

       The returned stream is the side-band-64k protocol supported by the git-upload-pack service, and the pack
       is embedded into stream 1. Progress messages from the server side MAY appear in stream 2.

       Here a "closed set of objects" is defined to have at least one path from every "want" to at least one
       "common" object.

       If the server needs more information, it replies with a status continue response: TODO: Document the
       non-pack response

       C: Parse the upload-pack response: TODO: Document parsing response

       <u>Do</u> <u>another</u> <u>compute</u> <u>step.</u>
