       slapo-pcache - proxy cache overlay to slapd

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/ldap/slapd.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>pcache</b> overlay to <b><a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd</a></b>(8) allows caching of LDAP search requests (queries) in a local database.  For
       an  incoming  query, the proxy cache determines its corresponding <b>template</b>. If the template was specified
       as cacheable using the <b>pcacheTemplate</b> directive and the request is contained in a cached request,  it  is
       answered  from the proxy cache.  Otherwise, the search is performed as usual and cacheable search results
       are saved in the cache for use in future queries.

       A template is defined by a filter string and an index identifying  a  set  of  attributes.  The  <b>template</b>
       <b>string</b>  for  a query can be obtained by removing assertion values from the RFC 4515 representation of its
       search filter. A query belongs to a template if its template  string  and  set  of  projected  attributes
       correspond   to  a  cacheable  template.   Examples  of  template  strings  are  <b>(mail=)</b>,  <b>(|(sn=)(cn=))</b>,
       <b>(&amp;(sn=)(givenName=))</b>.

       The config directives that are specific to the <b>pcache</b> overlay  can  be  prefixed  by  <b>pcache-</b>,  to  avoid
       conflicts  with directives specific to the underlying database or to other stacked overlays.  This may be
       particularly useful for those directives that refer to the backend used for local storage.  The following
       cache specific directives can be used to configure the proxy cache:

       <b>overlay</b> <b>pcache</b>
              This directive adds the proxy cache overlay to the current backend. The proxy cache overlay may be
              used with any backend but is intended for use with the <b>ldap</b>, <b>meta</b>, and <b>sql</b> backends.  Please  note
              that the underlying backend must have a configured <b>rootdn.</b>

       <b>pcache</b> <b>&lt;database&gt;</b> <b>&lt;max_entries&gt;</b> <b>&lt;numattrsets&gt;</b> <b>&lt;entry_limit&gt;</b> <b>&lt;cc_period&gt;</b>
              The  directive  enables  proxy caching in the current backend and sets general cache parameters. A
              &lt;database&gt; backend will be used internally to maintain the cached  entries.  The  chosen  database
              will  need  to  be configured as well, as shown below. Cache replacement is invoked when the cache
              size grows to &lt;max_entries&gt; entries and continues till the  cache  size  drops  below  this  size.
              &lt;numattrsets&gt;  should  be  equal  to the number of following <b>pcacheAttrset</b> directives. Queries are
              cached only if they correspond to a cacheable template (specified by the <b>pcacheTemplate</b> directive)
              and the number of entries returned is less than  &lt;entry_limit&gt;.  Consistency  check  is  performed
              every  &lt;cc_period&gt;  duration  (specified  in  secs).  In  each cycle queries with expired "time to
              live(<b>TTL</b>)" are removed. A sample cache configuration is:

              pcache <b>mdb</b> <b>10000</b> <b>1</b> <b>50</b> <b>100</b>

       <b>pcacheAttrset</b> <b>&lt;index&gt;</b> <b>&lt;attrs...&gt;</b>
              Used to associate a set of attributes &lt;attrs..&gt; with an &lt;index&gt;. Each attribute set is  associated
              with  an integer from 0 to &lt;numattrsets&gt;-1. These indices are used by the <b>pcacheTemplate</b> directive
              to define cacheable templates.  A set of attributes cannot be empty.   A  set  of  attributes  can
              contain  the  special  attributes  "*"  (all user attributes), "+" (all operational attributes) or
              both; in the latter case, any other attribute is redundant and should be avoided for  clarity.   A
              set  of attributes can contain "1.1" as the only attribute; in this case, only the presence of the
              entries is cached.  Attributes prefixed by "undef:" need  not  be  present  in  the  schema.   The
              "undef" keyword cannot be used with the <b><a href="../man5/slapd-mdb.5.html">slapd-mdb</a>(5)</b> backend as it requires all schema elements be
              fully defined.

       <b>pcacheMaxQueries</b> <b>&lt;queries&gt;</b>
              Specify the maximum number of queries to cache. The default is 10000.

       <b>pcacheValidate</b> <b>{</b> <b>TRUE</b> <b>|</b> <b>FALSE</b> <b>}</b>
              Check  whether  the results of a query being cached can actually be returned from the cache by the
              proxy DSA.  When enabled, the entries being returned while caching the  results  of  a  query  are
              checked  to  ensure  consistency  with the schema known to the proxy DSA.  In case of failure, the
              query is not cached.  By default, the check is off.

       <b>pcacheOffline</b> <b>{</b> <b>TRUE</b> <b>|</b> <b>FALSE</b> <b>}</b>
              Set the cache to offline mode. While offline, the consistency  checker  will  be  stopped  and  no
              expirations  will occur. This allows the cache contents to be used indefinitely while the proxy is
              cut off from network access to the remote DSA.  The default is FALSE, i.e. consistency checks  and
              expirations will be performed.

       <b>pcachePersist</b> <b>{</b> <b>TRUE</b> <b>|</b> <b>FALSE</b> <b>}</b>
              Specify  whether  the  cached  queries  should  be  saved across restarts of the caching proxy, to
              provide hot startup of the cache.  Only non-expired queries are reloaded.  The default is FALSE.

              <b>CAVEAT</b>: of course, the configuration of the proxy cache  must  not  change  across  restarts;  the
              pcache  overlay  does  not  perform  any consistency checks in this sense.  In detail, this option
              should be disabled unless the existing <b>pcacheAttrset</b> and <b>pcacheTemplate</b> directives are not changed
              neither in order nor in contents.  If new sets and templates are added, or if other details of the
              pcache overlay configuration changed, this feature should not be affected.

       <b>pcacheTemplate</b> <b>&lt;template_string&gt;</b> <b>&lt;attrset_index&gt;</b> <b>&lt;ttl&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;negttl&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;limitttl&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;ttr&gt;]]]</b>
              Specifies a cacheable template and "time to live" &lt;ttl&gt; of queries belonging to the  template.  An
              optional  &lt;negttl&gt;  can be used to specify that negative results (i.e., queries that returned zero
              entries) should also be cached for the specified amount of time. Negative results are  not  cached
              by  default  (&lt;negttl&gt;  set  to  0).   An  optional &lt;limitttl&gt; can be used to specify that results
              hitting a sizelimit should also be cached for the specified amount of  time.   Results  hitting  a
              sizelimit  are  not  cached by default (&lt;limitttl&gt; set to 0).  An optional &lt;ttr&gt; "time to refresh"
              can be used to specify that cached entries should be automatically refreshed after a certain time.
              Entries will only be refreshed while they have not expired, so the &lt;ttl&gt; should be larger than the
              &lt;ttr&gt; for this option to be useful. Entries are not refreshed by default (&lt;ttr&gt; set to 0).

       <b>pcacheBind</b> <b>&lt;filter_template&gt;</b> <b>&lt;attrset_index&gt;</b> <b>&lt;ttr&gt;</b> <b>&lt;scope&gt;</b> <b>&lt;base&gt;</b>
              Specifies  a  template  for  caching  Simple  Bind  credentials  based  on  an   already   defined
              <b>pcacheTemplate</b>.  The  &lt;filter_template&gt;  is similar to a &lt;template_string&gt; except that it may have
              some values present. Its purpose is to allow the overlay to generate filters similar to what other
              applications do when they do a Search immediately before a Bind. E.g., if a client  like  nss_ldap
              is configured to search for a user with the filter "(&amp;(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=&lt;username&gt;))"
              then  the  corresponding  template "(&amp;(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=))" should be used here. When
              converted  to  a  regular  template  e.g.  "(&amp;(objectClass=)(uid=))"   this   template   and   the
              &lt;attrset_index&gt;  must  match an already defined <b>pcacheTemplate</b> clause. The "time to refresh" &lt;ttr&gt;
              determines the time interval after which the cached credentials may be refreshed. The  first  Bind
              request  that occurs after that time will trigger the refresh attempt. Refreshes are not performed
              when the overlay is Offline. There is no "time to live" parameter for the  Bind  credentials;  the
              credentials  will  expire according to the <b>pcacheTemplate</b> ttl. The &lt;scope&gt; and &lt;base&gt; should match
              the search scope and base used by the authentication  clients.  The  cached  credentials  are  not
              stored  in cleartext, they are hashed using the default password hash.  By default Bind caching is
              not enabled.

       <b>pcachePosition</b> <b>{</b> <b>head</b> <b>|</b> <b>tail</b> <b>}</b>
              Specifies whether the response callback should be placed at the <b>tail</b> (the default) or at the  <b>head</b>
              (actually,  wherever  the  stacking  sequence  would  make  it appear) of the callback list.  This
              affects how the overlay interacts with other overlays, since  the  proxycache  overlay  should  be
              executed as early as possible (and thus configured as late as possible), to get a chance to return
              the  cached  results;  however,  if executed early at response, it would cache entries that may be
              later "massaged" by other databases and thus returned <u>after</u> massaging the first time,  and  <u>before</u>
              massaging when cached.

       There are some constraints:

              all values must be positive;

              <b>&lt;entry_limit&gt;</b> must be less than or equal to <b>&lt;max_entries&gt;</b>;

              <b>&lt;numattrsets&gt;</b> attribute sets SHOULD be defined by using the directive <b>pcacheAttrset</b>;

              all attribute sets SHOULD be referenced by (at least) one <b>pcacheTemplate</b> directive;

       The following adds a template with filter string <b>(&amp;(sn=)(givenName=))</b> and attributes mail, postaladdress,
       telephonenumber and a TTL of 1 hour.

              pcacheAttrset <b>0</b> <b>mail</b> <b>postaladdress</b> <b>telephonenumber</b>
              pcacheTemplate <b>(&amp;(sn=)(givenName=))</b> <b>0</b> <b>3600</b>

       Directives for configuring the underlying database must also be given, as shown here:

              directory /var/tmp/cache
              maxsize   1073741824

       Any valid directives for the chosen database type may be used. Indexing should be used as appropriate for
       the  queries  being  handled.  In  addition,  an  equality index on the <b>pcacheQueryid</b> attribute should be
       configured, to assist in the removal of expired query data.

</pre><h4><b>BACKWARD</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration keywords have been renamed and the older form is deprecated. These older  keywords  are
       still recognized but may disappear in future releases.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Caching  data  is  prone to inconsistencies because updates on the remote server will not be reflected in
       the response of the cache at least (and at most) for the  duration  of  the  <b>pcacheTemplate</b>  <b>TTL</b>.   These
       inconsistencies can be minimized by careful use of the TTR.

       The  proxy cache overlay requires a full result set of data to properly function. Therefore it will strip
       out the paged results control if it is requested by the client.

       The remote server should expose the <b>objectClass</b> attribute because the underlying database  that  actually
       caches the entries may need it for optimal local processing of the queries.

       The proxy server should contain all the schema information required for caching.  Significantly, it needs
       the  schema  of  attributes used in the query templates.  If the objectClass attribute is used in a query
       template, it needs the definition of the objectClasses of the entries it is supposed to cache.  It is the
       responsibility of the proxy administrator to keep the proxy schema lined up  with  that  of  the  proxied
       server.

       Another  potential  (and subtle) inconsistency may occur when data is retrieved with different identities
       and specific per-identity access control is enforced by the remote server.  If data was retrieved with an
       identity that collected only partial results because of access rules enforcement on  the  remote  server,
       other  users  with  different  access privileges on the remote server will get different results from the
       remote server and from the cache.  If those users have higher access privileges  on  the  remote  server,
       they will get from the cache only a subset of the results they would get directly from the remote server;
       but  if  they  have  lower access privileges, they will get from the cache a superset of the results they
       would get directly from the remote server.  Either occurrence may or may not be acceptable, based on  the
       security  policy  of  the  cache and of the remote server.  It is important to note that in this case the
       proxy is violating the security of the remote server by disclosing to an identity data that was collected
       by another identity.  For this reason, it is suggested that, when using <b>back-ldap</b>, proxy caching be  used
       in  conjunction  with  the  <u>identity</u>  <u>assertion</u>  feature  of <b><a href="../man5/slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap</a></b>(5) (see the <b>idassert-bind</b> and the
       <b>idassert-authz</b> statements), so that remote server interrogation occurs with a vanilla identity  that  has
       some relatively high <b>search</b> and <b>read</b> access privileges, and the "real" access control is delegated to the
       proxy's ACLs.  Beware that since only the cached fraction of the real datum is available to the cache, it
       may  not  be  possible  to  enforce  the  same  access rules that are defined on the remote server.  When
       security is a concern, cached proxy access must be carefully tailored.
