       vim-registry - syntax for vim-addons registry files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>PACKAGE-NAME.yaml</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  registry  file  is  a  multi-document  YAML  file  (i.e.  it can be composed by several different YAML
       documents separated by “---” lines). Each  YAML  document  represents  a  registry  entry,  that  is  the
       information describing a single addon.

       Ideally, the registry directory contains one file per package shipping addons; with a filename obeying to
       the  convention  <u>PACKAGE-NAME.yaml</u>.   Hence a single package can contribute to the registry with multiple
       entries described in a single YAML file.

       For example, the “vim-scripts” package  should  ship  a  single  <u>/usr/share/vim/registry/vim-scripts.yaml</u>
       file,  containing  one  YAML  document  per shipped addon. The first lines of such file can look like the
       following:

           addon: alternate
           description: "alternate pairing files (e.g. .c/.h) with short ex-commands"
           basedir: <u>/usr/share/vim-scripts/</u>
           disabledby: "let loaded_alternateFile = 1"
           files:
             - <u>plugin/a.vim</u>
             - <u>doc/alternate.txt</u>
           ---
           addon: whatdomain
           description: "query the meaning of a Top Level Domain"
           basedir: <u>/usr/share/vim-scripts/</u>
           disabledby: "let loaded_whatdomain = 1"
           files:
             - <u>plugin/whatdomain.vim</u>
           ---

       Each registry entry may contain the following fields, to be typeset according to the YAML specification:

       addon (Required)
              Name of the addon.

       description (Required)
              Human understandable textual description of the addon.

       files (Required)
              List of the files which compose the addon and are required to be present in a component of the Vim
              runtime path for the addon to be enabled.  Each file is specified relative to a component  of  the
              Vim runtime path.

       basedir (Optional)
              Directory where the files shipped by the addon (i.e., where the symlinks of the user/sysadm should
              point to) reside on the filesystem.  Default is <u><a href="file:/usr/share/vim/addons">/usr/share/vim/addons</a></u>.

       disabledby (Optional)
              Vim  script  command that can be used (usually by adding it to <u><a href="file:~/.vimrc">~/.vimrc</a></u>) to prevent the addon from
              being used even when it is installed.  The intended usage of  this  field  is  to  “blacklist”  an
              undesired  addon  whose files are available, and hence automatically loaded by Vim, in a component
              of the Vim runtime path.
