       pagesizes - <u>HylaFAX</u> page size definitions

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pagesizes</u> database defines the page dimensions and guaranteed reproducible areas (GRA) for well-known
       page  sizes.   The  GRA  is  the  portion  of  the  page that is guaranteed to be imaged during facsimile
       transmission.  This region is typically less than the  full  page  dimensions  because  of  paper  roller
       contacts and other mechanical aspects of the printing process in a facsimile machine.

       All  <u>HylaFAX</u>  programs that require page size information read the information from this database using a
       page size name.  Documents should be prepared such that the full page dimensions are  employed  with  the
       imaged area contained within the GRA.

       The  system-wide  default  page  size  to  use  in  preparing  documents for transmission is given by the
       ``<u>default</u>'' entry in the database.  (NB: the default entry should be placed last so that inverse  matches
       find the real page size name and not the default entry.)

       The  page  size  database is an ASCII file with the following format.  Each entry consists of whitespace-
       separated fields:
       name  abbrev  width  height  gra-width  gra-height  top-margin  left-margin
       Fields have the following interpretation:

       <b>name</b>        the full name for the page size; e.g. ISO A4;

       <b>abbrev</b>      an abbreviated version of the full name for use in compact listings such as the receive queue
                   listing printed by <u><a href="../man1/faxstat.1.html">faxstat</a></u>(1);

       <b>width</b>       the full width of the page;

       <b>height</b>      the full height of the page;

       <b>gra-width</b>   the width of the GRA;

       <b>gra-height</b>  the height of the GRA;

       <b>top-margin</b>  the margin between the top of the full page and the top of the GRA;

       <b>left-margin</b> the margin between the left side of the full page the left side of the GRA.

       The first two fields must be separated from the subsequent fields by a tab character  (possibly  followed
       by  more  whitespace); this is done to easily permit blank characters to be included in names.  Otherwise
       fields can be separated by any amount of any kind of whitespace.  Numbers are all base 10  and  in  basic
       measurement  units  (BMU);  defined  as 1/1200 x 25.4 millimeters for paper output with a scale factor of
       one.  All fields must be present on a  single  line;  otherwise  the  entry  is  ignored.   Comments  are
       introduced by the ``#'' character and continue to the end the line.

       Page  size  database  lookups  are  either  by  name  or by page dimensions.  Lookups by name are done by
       sequentially scanning the entries in the database for the first entry that has a matching abbreviation or
       substring of the page size name field.  The string comparisons ignore case so, for example, ``a4''  would
       match  a full name of ``ISO A4''.  Lookups by dimension scan the entire database and return the page with
       the closest dimensions using a straightforward distance metric.  If the difference in dimensions  of  the
       closest  match  is  greater  than  1/2  inch on each side, then no page entry is returned for a lookup by
       dimension.
