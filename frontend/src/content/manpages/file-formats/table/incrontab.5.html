</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       incrontab - tables for driving inotify cron (incron)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An  incrontab  file contains instructions to the <u><a href="../man8/incrond.8.html">incrond</a></u>(8) daemon of the general form: "run this command
       on these file events". There are two categories of tables: system tables (with root privileges) and  user
       tables (with user privileges).

       System  tables are (by default) located in /etc/incron.d and may have any names. Each system table exists
       separately inside incron and their watches never collide.

       Each user has their own table, and commands in any given incrontab will be executed as the user who  owns
       the incrontab. System users (such as apache, postfix, nobody etc.) may have their own incrontab.

       incrontab files are read when the <u><a href="../man8/incrond.8.html">incrond</a></u>(8) daemon starts and after any change (incrontab file are being
       hooked when incrond is running).

       Blank lines are ignored. The general line format is the following:

       &lt;path&gt; &lt;mask&gt; &lt;command&gt;

       Where  <u>path</u>  is  an  absolute  filesystem  path,  <u>mask</u> is an event mask (in symbolic or numeric form) and
       <u>command</u> is an executable file (or a script) with its arguments. See below for  event  mask  symbols.  The
       executable  file  may  be  noted  as  an  absolute  path  or  only as the name itself (PATH locations are
       examined).

       Please remember that the same path may occur only once per table (otherwise  only  the  first  occurrence
       takes  effect  and  an  error  message  is emitted to the system log).  Please not that the * wildcard is
       allowed to observe a range of files.

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>SYMBOLS</b></h4><pre>
       These basic event mask symbols are defined:

       <b>IN_ACCESS</b>           File was accessed (read) (*)
       <b>IN_ATTRIB</b>           Metadata changed (permissions, timestamps, extended attributes, etc.) (*)
       <b>IN_CLOSE_WRITE</b>      File opened for writing was closed (*)
       <b>IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE</b>    File not opened for writing was closed (*)
       <b>IN_CREATE</b>           File/directory created in watched directory (*)
       <b>IN_DELETE</b>           File/directory deleted from watched directory (*)
       <b>IN_DELETE_SELF</b>           Watched file/directory was itself deleted
       <b>IN_MODIFY</b>           File was modified (*)
       <b>IN_MOVE_SELF</b>        Watched file/directory was itself moved
       <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b>       File moved out of watched directory (*)
       <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b>         File moved into watched directory (*)
       <b>IN_OPEN</b>             File was opened (*)

       When monitoring a directory, the events marked with an asterisk (*) above can  occur  for  files  in  the
       directory, in which case the name field in the returned event data identifies the name of the file within
       the directory.

       The  <b>IN_ALL_EVENTS</b> symbol is defined as a bit mask of all of the above events. Two additional convenience
       symbols are <b>IN_MOVE</b>, which is a combination of <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> and <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b>, and <b>IN_CLOSE</b> which combines
       <b>IN_CLOSE_WRITE</b> and <b>IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE</b>.

       The following further symbols can be specified in the mask:

       <b>IN_DONT_FOLLOW</b>      Don't dereference pathname if it is a symbolic link
       <b>IN_ONESHOT</b>          Monitor pathname for only one event
       <b>IN_ONLYDIR</b>          Only watch pathname if it is a directory

       Additionally, there is a symbol which doesn't appear in the inotify symbol set. It is <b>loopable=true</b>. This
       symbol disables monitoring events until the current one is completely handled (until  its  child  process
       exits).   Also,  there is the symbol <b>recursive=false</b>. This symbol limits the observation on the specified
       directory and does not include subdirectories.  Finally, there is  also  the  symbol  <b>dotdirs=true</b>.  This
       symbol will include the hidden directories (where the names starts with a dot) in the observation.

</pre><h4><b>WILDCARDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following wildards may be used inside command specification:

       <b>$$</b>   dollar sign
       <b>$@</b>   watched filesystem path (see above)
       <b>$#</b>   event-related file name
       <b>$%</b>   event flags (textually)
       <b>$&amp;</b>   event flags (numerically)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       These are some example rules which can be used in an incrontab file:

       <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> <b>IN_ALL_EVENTS</b> <b>abcd</b> <b>$@/$#</b> <b>$%</b>

       <b><a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a></b> <b>IN_ACCESS,loopable=true</b> <b>abcd</b> <b>$#</b>

       <b><a href="file:/home">/home</a></b> <b>IN_CREATE</b> <b>/usr/local/bin/abcd</b> <b>$#</b>

       <b><a href="file:/home">/home</a></b> <b>IN_CREATE,dotdirs=true</b> <b>/usr/local/bin/abcd</b> <b>$#</b>

       <b><a href="file:/home">/home</a></b> <b>IN_CREATE,recursive=false</b> <b>/usr/local/bin/abcd</b> <b>$#</b>

       <b><a href="file:/var/log">/var/log</a></b> <b>12</b> <b>abcd</b> <b>$@/$#</b>

       The  first  line  monitors  all  events on the <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> directory. When an event occurs it runs a application
       called 'abcd' with the full path of the file as the first arguments and the event  flags  as  the  second
       one.

       The  second line monitors accesses (readings) on the <a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a> directory. The application 'abcd' is run as
       a handler and the appropriate event watch is disabled until the program finishes. The file name  (without
       the directory path) is passed in as an argument.

       The  third  example  is used for monitoring the <a href="file:/home">/home</a> directory for newly create files or directories (it
       practically means an event is sent when a new user is added).  This  event  is  processed  by  a  program
       specified by an absolute path.

       The fourth example is the third example, but it will include hidden directories in the observation.

       The fifth example is the third example, but it will exclude sub-directories from the observation.

       And  the  final  line shows how to use numeric event mask instead of textual one. The value 12 is exactly
       the same as IN_ATTRIB,IN_CLOSE_WRITE.
