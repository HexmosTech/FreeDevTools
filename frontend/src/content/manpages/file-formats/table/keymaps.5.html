       keymaps - keyboard table descriptions for loadkeys and dumpkeys

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These  files  are used by <b><a href="../man1/loadkeys.1.html">loadkeys</a></b>(1) to modify the translation tables used by the kernel keyboard driver
       and generated by <b><a href="../man1/dumpkeys.1.html">dumpkeys</a></b>(1) from those translation tables.

       The format of these files is vaguely similar to the one accepted by <b><a href="../man1/xmodmap.1.html">xmodmap</a></b>(1).   The  file  consists  of
       charset or key or string definition lines interspersed with comments.

       Comments  are  introduced with <b>!</b>  or <b>#</b> characters and continue to the end of the line. Anything following
       one of these characters on that line is ignored. Note that comments need not begin  from  column  one  as
       with <b><a href="../man1/xmodmap.1.html">xmodmap</a></b>(1).

       The  syntax  of  keymap  files is line oriented; a complete definition must fit on a single logical line.
       Logical lines can, however, be split into multiple  physical  lines  by  ending  each  subline  with  the
       backslash character (\).

</pre><h4><b>INCLUDE</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       A keymap can include other keymaps using the syntax

              include "pathname"

</pre><h4><b>CHARSET</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A character set definition line is of the form:

              charset "iso-8859-x"

       It  defines  how  following  keysyms are to be interpreted.  For example, in iso-8859-1 the symbol mu (or
       micro) has code 0265, while in iso-8859-7 the letter mu has code 0354.

</pre><h4><b>COMPLETE</b> <b>KEYCODE</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Each complete key definition line is of the form:

              <b>keycode</b> <u>keynumber</u> <b>=</b> <u>keysym</u> <u>keysym</u> <u>keysym</u>...

       <u>keynumber</u> is the internal identification number of the key, roughly equivalent to the scan  code  of  it.
       <u>keynumber</u> can be given in decimal, octal or hexadecimal notation.  Octal is denoted by a leading zero and
       hexadecimal by the prefix <b>0x.</b>

       Each  of  the  <u>keysyms</u>  represent  keyboard actions, of which up to 256 can be bound to a single key. The
       actions available include outputting character  codes  or  character  sequences,  switching  consoles  or
       keymaps, booting the machine etc. (The complete list can be obtained from <b><a href="../man1/dumpkeys.1.html">dumpkeys</a></b>(1) by saying  <b>dumpkeys</b>
       <b>-l</b> .)

       Each  <u>keysym</u> may be prefixed by a '+' (plus sign), in which case this keysym is treated as a "letter" and
       therefore affected by the "CapsLock" the same way as by "Shift" (to be correct, the CapsLock inverts  the
       Shift  state).   The  ASCII  letters  ('a'-'z'  and  'A'-'Z')  are  made  CapsLock'able  by  default.  If
       Shift+CapsLock should not produce a lower case symbol, put lines like

              <b>keycode</b> <b>30</b> <b>=</b> <b>+a</b>  <b>A</b>

       in the map file.

       Which of the actions bound to a given key is taken when it is pressed depends on what  modifiers  are  in
       effect at that moment.  The keyboard driver supports 9 modifiers. These modifiers are labeled (completely
       arbitrarily)  Shift,  AltGr,  Control,  Alt,  ShiftL,  ShiftR, CtrlL, CtrlR and CapsShift.  Each of these
       modifiers has an associated weight of power of two according to the following table:

              <u>modifier</u>            <u>weight</u>

              Shift                  1
              AltGr                  2
              Control                4
              Alt                    8
              ShiftL                16
              ShiftR                32
              CtrlL                 64
              CtrlR                128
              CapsShift            256

       The effective action of a key is found out by adding up the weights of all the modifiers  in  effect.  By
       default,  no  modifiers  are  in effect, so action number zero, i.e. the one in the first column in a key
       definition line, is taken when the key is pressed or released. When e.g. Shift and Alt modifiers  are  in
       effect, action number nine (from the 10th column) is the effective one.

       Changing  the state of what modifiers are in effect can be achieved by binding appropriate key actions to
       desired keys. For example, binding the symbol Shift to a key sets the Shift modifier in effect when  that
       key  is pressed and cancels the effect of that modifier when the key is released. Binding AltGr_Lock to a
       key sets AltGr in effect when the key is pressed and cancels the effect when the key  is  pressed  again.
       (By  default  Shift,  AltGr,  Control  and Alt are bound to the keys that bear a similar label; AltGr may
       denote the right Alt key.)

       Note that you should be very careful when binding the modifier keys, otherwise you can  end  up  with  an
       unusable  keyboard mapping. If you for example define a key to have Control in its first column and leave
       the rest of the columns to be VoidSymbols, you're in trouble. This  is  because  pressing  the  key  puts
       Control  modifier  in effect and the following actions are looked up from the fifth column (see the table
       above). So, when you release the key, the action from the fifth column is taken. It has VoidSymbol in it,
       so nothing happens. This means that the Control modifier is still in effect, although you  have  released
       the  key.   Re-pressing  and releasing the key has no effect. To avoid this, you should always define all
       the columns to have the same modifier symbol. There is a handy short-hand notation for this, see below.

       <u>keysyms</u> can be given in decimal, octal, hexadecimal, unicode or symbolic notation.  The numeric notations
       use the same format as with <u>keynumber</u>.  Unicode notation is "U+" followed  by  four  hexadecimal  digits.
       The symbolic notation resembles that used by <b><a href="../man1/xmodmap.1.html">xmodmap</a></b>(1).  Notable differences are the number symbols. The
       numeric  symbols '0', ..., '9' of <b><a href="../man1/xmodmap.1.html">xmodmap</a></b>(1) are replaced with the corresponding words 'zero', 'one', ...
       'nine' to avoid confusion with the numeric notation.

       It should be noted that using numeric notation for the <u>keysyms</u> is highly unportable  as  the  key  action
       numbers  may  vary  from  one kernel version to another and the use of numeric notations is thus strongly
       discouraged. They are intended to be used only when you know there is a supported keyboard action in your
       kernel for which your current version of <b><a href="../man1/loadkeys.1.html">loadkeys</a></b>(1) has no symbolic name.

       There is a number of short-hand notations to add readability and reduce typing work and  the  probability
       of typing-errors.

       First of all, you can give a map specification line, of the form

              keymaps 0-2,4-5,8,12

       to  indicate  that the lines of the keymap will not specify all 256 columns, but only the indicated ones.
       (In the example: only the plain, Shift, AltGr, Control, Control+Shift, Alt and Control+Alt maps, that is,
       7 columns instead of 256.)  When no such line is given, the keymaps 0-M will be defined, where M+1 is the
       maximum number of entries found in any definition line.

       Next, you can leave off any trailing VoidSymbol entries from a key definition line. VoidSymbol denotes  a
       keyboard  action  which  produces  no  output and has no other effects either. For example, to define key
       number 30 to output 'a' unshifted, 'A' when pressed with Shift and do nothing when pressed with AltGr  or
       other modifiers, you can write

              keycode  30 = a     A

       instead of the more verbose

              keycode  30 = a     A    VoidSymbol     VoidSymbol \
                        VoidSymbol VoidSymbol VoidSymbol ...

       For  added  convenience,  you  can  usually get off with still more terse definitions. If you enter a key
       definition line with only and exactly one action code after the equals sign, it has a special meaning. If
       the code (numeric or symbolic) is not an ASCII letter, it means the code is implicitly replicated through
       all columns being defined.  If, on the other hand, the action code is an ASCII  character  in  the  range
       'a',  ...,  'z'  or 'A', ..., 'Z' in the ASCII collating sequence, the following definitions are made for
       the different modifier combinations, provided these are actually being defined.  (The table lists the two
       possible cases: either the single action code is a lower case letter, denoted by 'x'  or  an  upper  case
       letter, denoted by 'Y'.)

           <u>modifier</u>                <u>symbol</u>

           none                    x              Y
           Shift                   X              y
           AltGr                   x              Y
           Shift+AltGr             X              y
           Control                 Control_x      Control_y
           Shift+Control           Control_x      Control_y
           AltGr+Control           Control_x      Control_y
           Shift+AltGr+Control     Control_x      Control_y
           Alt                     Meta_x         Meta_Y
           Shift+Alt               Meta_X         Meta_y
           AltGr+Alt               Meta_x         Meta_Y
           Shift+AltGr+Alt         Meta_X         Meta_y
           Control+Alt             Meta_Control_x Meta_Control_y
           Shift+Control+Alt       Meta_Control_x Meta_Control_y
           AltGr+Control+Alt       Meta_Control_x Meta_Control_y
           Shift+AltGr+Control+Alt Meta_Control_x Meta_Control_y

</pre><h4><b>SINGLE</b> <b>MODIFIER</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All  the  previous forms of key definition lines always define all the M+1 possible modifier combinations
       being defined, whether the line actually contains that many action codes or not.  There  is,  however,  a
       variation  of the definition syntax for defining only single actions to a particular modifier combination
       of a key. This is especially useful, if you load a keymap which doesn't match your  needs  in  only  some
       modifier  combinations,  like  AltGr+function  keys. You can then make a small local file redefining only
       those modifier combinations and loading it after the main file.  The syntax of this form is:

       { <b>plain</b> | &lt;modifier sequence&gt; } <b>keycode</b> <u>keynumber</u> <b>=</b> <u>keysym</u>

       , e.g.,
              plain keycode 14 = BackSpace
              control alt keycode 83 = Boot
              alt keycode 105 = Decr_Console
              alt keycode 106 = Incr_Console
       Using "plain" will define only the base entry of a key (i.e. the one with no modifiers in effect) without
       affecting the bindings of other modifier combinations of that key.

</pre><h4><b>STRING</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to comments and key definition lines, a keymap can contain string definitions. These are used
       to define what each function key action code sends. The syntax of string definitions is:

              <b>string</b> <u>keysym</u> <b>=</b> <b>"</b><u>text</u><b>"</b>

       <u>text</u> can contain literal characters, octal character codes in the format of backslash followed by  up  to
       three  octal  digits,  and  the  three escape sequences <b>\n</b>, <b>\\</b>, and <b>\"</b>, for newline, backslash and quote,
       respectively.

</pre><h4><b>COMPOSE</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Then there may also be compose definitions. They have syntax

              <b>compose</b> <b>'</b><u>char</u><b>'</b> <b>'</b><u>char</u><b>'</b> <b>to</b> <b>'</b><u>char</u><b>'</b>
       and describe how two bytes are combined to form a third one (when a dead accent or compose key is  used).
       This is used to get accented letters and the like on a standard keyboard.

</pre><h4><b>ABBREVIATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Various abbreviations can be used with kbd-0.96 and later.

       <b>strings</b> <b>as</b> <b>usual</b>
              Defines the usual values of the strings (but not the keys they are bound to).

       <b>compose</b> <b>as</b> <b>usual</b> <b>for</b> <b>"iso-8859-1"</b>
              Defines the usual compose combinations.

       To find out what <u>keysyms</u> there are available for use in keymaps, use the command

              <b>dumpkeys</b> <b>--long-info</b>

       Unfortunately,  there is currently no description of what each symbol does. It has to be guessed from the
       name or figured out from the kernel sources.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       (Be careful to use a keymaps line, like the first line of `dumpkeys`, or "keymaps 0-15" or so.)

       The following entry exchanges the left Control key and the Caps Lock key on the keyboard:

              keycode  58 = Control
              keycode  29 = Caps_Lock

       Key number 58 is normally the Caps Lock key, and key number 29 is normally the Control key.

       The following entry sets the Shift and Caps Lock keys to behave more nicely, like in  older  typewriters.
       That  is,  pressing Caps Lock key once or more sets the keyboard in CapsLock state and pressing either of
       the Shift keys releases it.

              keycode  42 = Uncaps_Shift
              keycode  54 = Uncaps_Shift
              keycode  58 = Caps_On

       The following entry sets the layout of the edit pad in the enhanced keyboard to be more like that in  the
       VT200 series terminals:

              keycode 102 = Insert
              keycode 104 = Remove
              keycode 107 = Prior
              shift keycode 107 = Scroll_Backward
              keycode 110 = Find
              keycode 111 = Select
              control alt   keycode 111 = Boot
              control altgr keycode 111 = Boot

       Here's  an  example to bind the string "du\ndf\n" to the key AltGr-D. We use the "spare" action code F100
       not normally bound to any key.

              altgr keycode 32 = F100
              string F100 = "du\ndf\n"
