       hosts.hfaxd - <u>HylaFAX</u> client access control list

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  ASCII  file  <b>etc/hosts.hfaxd</b>  in  the  <u>HylaFAX</u>  spooling area specifies the hosts and users that are
       permitted to access services through the <u><a href="../man8/hfaxd.8.html">hfaxd</a></u>(8) process.  This file must exist for client access; if it
       is not present then <u>hfaxd</u> will deny all requests for service.  Note also that this file must be  readable
       only by the ``fax'' user; i.e.  it should have mode 600 and be owned by ``fax''.

       Each  newline-terminated  entry  is  a  set of colon (:) separated fields, all but the first of which are
       optional.  Trailing null fields and their separators may be omitted.  The most general form is:

            client:uid:passwd:adminwd

       <u>client</u> is a regular expression to be matched against a string ``<u>user</u>@<u>host</u>'' that is formed from the  <u>user</u>
       string  passed  to  <u>hfaxd</u> with the <b>USER</b> command and the official <u>host</u> name or the DARPA Internet address,
       specified in ``dot notation''.  If <u>client</u> does not contain an ``@'' then, for backwards compatibility, it
       is treated as a host for which any user may have access;  i.e.  it  is  automatically  converted  to  the
       regular expression ``^.*@<u>client</u>$''.

       Comments  are  introduced  with  the  ``#''  character and extend to the end of the line.  Any whitespace
       immediately preceding a comment is also ignored.

       If <u>client</u> has a leading ``!'', then it is interpreted as a class of hosts and users to which access is to
       be <b>disallowed</b>.  That is, if the pattern matches the client information, then access is denied.

       Note that regular expressions are <b>not</b> anchored.  That is, a regular expression may match a  substring  of
       the  ``<u>user</u>@<u>host</u>'' string.  Thus `<u>pb</u>@<u>.*\.cl\.cam\.ac\.uk</u>' matches `<u>cpb</u>@<u>mc.cl.cam.ac.uk.esd.sgi.com</u>'.  Use
       ``^'' to match the start of the string and ``$'' to match the end.

       Fields following <u>client</u> are optional and specify the following:

       <b>uid</b>       The numerical user ID to assign to clients that use the entry for access.  <u>hfaxd</u> uses  the  <u>uid</u>
                 to  control access to server resources such as jobs and documents (the value is used to set the
                 group ID of files created by a client).

                 Multiple clients/users may share the same <u>uid</u> or unique IDs may be  created  for  each  client.
                 User  IDs may be any number in the range [0..60002] with 60002 used, by convention, for entries
                 that do not have a <u>uid</u> specified.

       <b>passwd</b>    The encrypted password.  If this field is empty (null) then no password will be demanded when a
                 client logs in; i.e. the <b>USER</b> command does not need to be followed by a <b>PASS</b> command.

       <b>adminwd</b>   The encrypted password for this user to gain administrative privileges.  If this field is empty
                 (null) then the user is not permitted to have administrative privileges.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The following is a sample hosts.hfaxd file.  Note that the first entry that matches is  taken,  so  more-
       specific entries should be placed first.
              ^pb@[^.]*\.cl\.cam\.ac\.uk$:::hFy8zXq2KaG8s
                                     # pb on a machine directly in cl.cam.ac.uk can
                                     # administer if an admin pw is given
              127.0.0.1              # anyone on local host uses the default uid
              ^sam@flake.*sgi\.com$  # Sam on his work machine
              ^sam@oxford.*Berkeley.*# Sam on any machine starting oxford and containing
                                     # Berkeley, e.g. <a href="mailto:sam@oxfordberkeley.cl.cam.ac.uk">sam@oxfordberkeley.cl.cam.ac.uk</a>
              ^.*@.*.\.esd\.         # anyone in an esd domain
              !^tom@                 # Tom Davis is denied access
              .*\.sgi\.com$          # but anyone else at sgi is ok
