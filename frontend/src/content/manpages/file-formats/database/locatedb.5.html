       locatedb - front-compressed file name database

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  documents  the format of file name databases for the GNU version of <b>locate</b>.  The file
       name databases contain lists of files that were in particular directory trees  when  the  databases  were
       last updated.

       There  can  be multiple databases.  Users can select which databases <b>locate</b> searches using an environment
       variable or command line option; see <b><a href="../man1/locate.1.html">locate</a></b>(1).  The system administrator can choose the file name of the
       default database, the frequency with which the databases are updated, and the directories for which  they
       contain entries.  Normally, file name databases are updated by running the <b>updatedb</b> program periodically,
       typically nightly; see <b><a href="../man1/updatedb.1.html">updatedb</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>GNU</b> <b>LOCATE02</b> <b>database</b> <b>format</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  the  default  format  of  databases  produced by <b>updatedb</b>.  The <b>updatedb</b> program runs <b>frcode</b> to
       compress the list of file names using front-compression, which reduces the database size by a factor of 4
       to 5.  Front-compression (also known as incremental encoding) works as follows.

       The database entries are a sorted list (case-insensitively, for users' convenience).  Since the  list  is
       sorted,  each  entry is likely to share a prefix (initial string) with the previous entry.  Each database
       entry begins with an signed offset-differential count byte, which is the additional number of  characters
       of  prefix  of  the  preceding  entry  to  use beyond the number that the preceding entry is using of its
       predecessor.  (The counts can be negative.)  Following the count is a null-terminated ASCII  remainder  —
       the part of the name that follows the shared prefix.

       If  the  offset-differential count is larger than can be stored in a signed byte (±127), the byte has the
       value 0x80 (binary 10000000) and the actual count follows in a 2-byte word,  with  the  high  byte  first
       (network  byte  order).   This  count  can  also  be negative (the sign bit being in the first of the two
       bytes).

       Every database begins with a dummy entry for a file called `LOCATE02', which <b>locate</b> checks for to  ensure
       that the database file has the correct format; it ignores the entry in doing the search.

       Databases  cannot  be  concatenated together, even if the first (dummy) entry is trimmed from all but the
       first database.  This is because the offset-differential count in the  first  entry  of  the  second  and
       following databases will be wrong.

       In  the future, the data within the locate database may not be sorted in any particular order.  To obtain
       sorted results, pipe the output of <b>locate</b> through <b>sort</b> <b>-f</b>.

</pre><h4><b>slocate</b> <b>database</b> <b>format</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>slocate</b> program uses a database format similar to, but not quite the same as, GNU <b>locate</b>.  The  first
       byte  of the database specifies its <u>security</u> <u>level</u>.  If the security level is 0, <b>slocate</b> will read, match
       and print filenames on the basis of the information in the database only.  However, if the security level
       byte is 1, <b>slocate</b> omits entries from its output if the invoking user is  unable  to  access  them.   The
       second byte of the database is zero.  The second byte is followed by the first database entry.  The first
       entry in the database is not preceded by any differential count or dummy entry.  Instead the differential
       count for the first item is assumed to be zero.

       Starting  with  the  second  entry  (if any) in the database, data is interpreted as for the GNU LOCATE02
       format.

</pre><h4><b>Old</b> <b>Locate</b> <b>Database</b> <b>format</b></h4><pre>
       There is also an old database format, used by Unix <b>locate</b> and <b>find</b> programs and earlier releases  of  the
       GNU ones.  <b>updatedb</b> runs programs called <b>bigram</b> and <b>code</b> to produce old-format databases.  The old format
       differs from the above description in the following ways.  Instead of each entry starting with an offset-
       differential  count  byte  and  ending  with  a  null,  byte  values  from  0 through 28 indicate offset-
       differential counts from -14 through 14.  The byte value indicating that a long offset-differential count
       follows is 0x1e (30), not 0x80.  The long counts are stored in host byte order, which is not  necessarily
       network byte order, and host integer word size, which is usually 4 bytes.  They also represent a count 14
       less  than  their  value.   The  database  lines  have no termination byte; the start of the next line is
       indicated by its first byte having a value ≤ 30.

       In addition, instead of starting with a dummy entry, the old database format starts with a 256 byte table
       containing the 128 most common bigrams in the file list.  A bigram is a pair of adjacent bytes.  Bytes in
       the database that have the high bit set are indexes (with the high bit cleared) into  the  bigram  table.
       The bigram and offset-differential count coding makes these databases 20–25% smaller than the new format,
       but makes them not 8-bit clean.  Any byte in a file name that is in the ranges used for the special codes
       is replaced in the database by a question mark, which not coincidentally is the shell wildcard to match a
       single character.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Input to <b>frcode</b>:
       <a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a>
       /usr/src/cmd/aardvark.c
       /usr/src/cmd/armadillo.c
       /usr/tmp/zoo

       Length of the longest prefix of the preceding entry to share:
       0 <a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a>
       8 /cmd/aardvark.c
       14 rmadillo.c
       5 tmp/zoo

       Output from <b>frcode</b>, with trailing nulls changed to newlines and count bytes made printable:
       0 LOCATE02
       0 <a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a>
       8 /cmd/aardvark.c
       6 rmadillo.c
       -9 tmp/zoo

       (6 = 14 - 8, and -9 = 5 - 14)
