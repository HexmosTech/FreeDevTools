</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       groff_tmac - macro files in the GNU <u>roff</u> typesetting system

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Definitions  of  macros, strings, and registers for use in a <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) document can be collected into <u>macro</u>
       <u>files</u>, <u>roff</u> input files designed to produce no output themselves but  instead  ease  the  preparation  of
       other  <u>roff</u>  documents.   There  is  no  syntactical  difference  between a macro file and any other <u>roff</u>
       document; only its purpose distinguishes it.  When a macro file is  installed  at  a  standard  location,
       named according to a certain convention, and suitable for use by a general audience, it is termed a <u>macro</u>
       <u>package</u>.  Macro packages can be loaded by supplying the <b>-m</b> option to <u><a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff</a></u>(1) or a <u>groff</u> front end.

       Each  macro  package  stores its macro, string, and register definitions in one or more <u>tmac</u> files.  This
       name originated in early Unix culture as an abbreviation of “<u>troff</u> macros”.

       A macro file must have a name in the form name<u>.tmac</u> (or <u>tmac.</u>name) and be placed in a “<u>tmac</u> directory” to
       be loadable with  the  <b>-m</b><u>name</u>  option.   Section  “Environment”  of  <u><a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff</a></u>(1)  lists  these  directories.
       Alternatively, a <u>groff</u> document requiring a macro file can load it with the <b>mso</b> (“macro source”) request.

       Like  any  other  <u>roff</u>  document,  a macro file can use the “<b>so</b>” request (“source”) to load further files
       relative to its own location.

       Macro files are named for their most noteworthy application, but a macro file need not define any macros.
       It can restrict itself to defining registers and strings or invoking other <u>groff</u> requests.  It  can  even
       be empty.

</pre><h4><b>Macro</b> <b>packages</b></h4><pre>
       Macro  packages  come  in  two  varieties;  those  which  assume responsibility for page layout and other
       critical functions (“major” or “full-service”) and those which do not  (“supplemental”  or  “auxiliary”).
       GNU  <u>roff</u>  provides  most  major  macro  packages found in AT&amp;T and BSD Unix systems, an additional full-
       service package, and many supplemental packages.  Multiple full-service macro packages cannot be used  by
       the same document.  Auxiliary packages can generally be freely combined, though attention to their use of
       the  <u>groff</u> language name spaces for identifiers (particularly registers, macros, strings, and diversions)
       should be paid.  Name space management was a significant challenge in AT&amp;T  <u>troff</u>;  <u>groff</u>'s  support  for
       arbitrarily   long  identifiers  affords  few  excuses  for  name  collisions,  apart  from  attempts  at
       compatibility with the demands of historical documents.

   <b>Man</b> <b>pages</b>
       <u>an</u>
       <u>man</u>    <u>an</u> is used to compose man pages in the format originating in Version 7  Unix  (1979).   It  has  a
              small macro interface and is widely used; see <u><a href="../man7/groff_man.7.html">groff_man</a></u>(7).

       <u>doc</u>
       <u>mdoc</u>   <u>doc</u>  is  used  to  compose man pages in the format originating in 4.3BSD-Reno (1990).  It provides
              many more features than <u>an</u>, but is also larger, more complex,  and  not  as  widely  adopted;  see
              <u><a href="../man7/groff_mdoc.7.html">groff_mdoc</a></u>(7).

       Because  readers  of  man  pages  often  do  not  know in advance which macros are used to format a given
       document, a wrapper is available.

       <u>andoc</u>
       <u>mandoc</u> This macro file, specific to <u>groff</u>, recognizes whether a document uses  <u>man</u>  or  <u>mdoc</u>  format  and
              loads  the  corresponding  macro  package.   Multiple man pages, in either format, can be handled;
              <u>andoc</u> reloads each macro package as necessary.

   <b>Full-service</b> <b>packages</b>
       The packages in this section provide a complete set of macros for writing documents of any  kind,  up  to
       whole books.  They are similar in functionality; it is a matter of taste which one to use.

       <u>me</u>     The classical <u>me</u> macro package; see <u><a href="../man7/groff_me.7.html">groff_me</a></u>(7).

       <u>mm</u>     The semi-classical <u>mm</u> macro package; see <u><a href="../man7/groff_mm.7.html">groff_mm</a></u>(7).

       <u>mom</u>    The  <u>mom</u>  macro package, only available in groff.  As this was not based on other packages, it was
              freely designed as quite a nice, modern macro package.  See <u><a href="../man7/groff_mom.7.html">groff_mom</a></u>(7).

       <u>ms</u>     The classical <u>ms</u> macro package; see <u><a href="../man7/groff_ms.7.html">groff_ms</a></u>(7).

   <b>Localization</b> <b>packages</b>
       For Western languages, the localization file sets the hyphenation mode and loads hyphenation patterns and
       exceptions.  Localization files can also adjust the date format and provide translations of strings  used
       by  some  of the full-service macro packages; alter the input encoding (see the next section); and change
       the amount of additional inter-sentence space.  For Eastern  languages,  the  localization  file  defines
       character classes and sets flags on them.  By default, <u>troffrc</u> loads the localization file for English.

       <u>trans</u>  loads  localized  strings  used  by  various  macro packages after their localized forms have been
              prepared by a localization macro file.

       <u>groff</u> provides the following localization files.

       <u>cs</u>     Czech; localizes <u>man</u>, <u>me</u>, <u>mm</u>, <u>mom</u>, and  <u>ms</u>.   Sets  the  input  encoding  to  Latin-2  by  loading
              <u>latin2.tmac</u>.

       <u>de</u>
       <u>den</u>    German;  localizes  <u>man</u>,  <u>me</u>,  <u>mm</u>,  <u>mom</u>,  and  <u>ms</u>.   Sets the input encoding to Latin-1 by loading
              <u>latin1.tmac</u>.

              <u>de.tmac</u> selects hyphenation patterns for traditional orthography, and <u>den.tmac</u> does the  same  for
              the new orthography (“Rechtschreibreform”).

       <u>en</u>     English.

       <u>fr</u>     French;  localizes  <u>man</u>,  <u>me</u>,  <u>mm</u>,  <u>mom</u>,  and  <u>ms</u>.   Sets the input encoding to Latin-9 by loading
              <u>latin9.tmac</u>.

       <u>it</u>     Italian; localizes <u>man</u>, <u>me</u>, <u>mm</u>, <u>mom</u>, and <u>ms</u>.

       <u>ja</u>     Japanese.

       <u>sv</u>     Swedish; localizes <u>man</u>, <u>me</u>, <u>mm</u>, <u>mom</u>, and <u>ms</u>.  Sets  the  input  encoding  to  Latin-1  by  loading
              <u>latin1.tmac</u>.   Some of the localization of the <u>mm</u> package is handled separately; see <u><a href="../man7/groff_mmse.7.html">groff_mmse</a></u>(7)
              (only in Swedish locales).

       <u>zh</u>     Chinese.

   <b>Input</b> <b>encodings</b>
       <u>latin1</u>
       <u>latin2</u>
       <u>latin5</u>
       <u>latin9</u> are various ISO 8859  input  encodings  supported  by  <u>groff</u>.   On  systems  using  ISO  character
              encodings,  <u>groff</u>  loads  <u>latin1.tmac</u>  automatically  at  startup.   A document that uses Latin-2,
              Latin-5, or Latin-9 can specify one of these alternative encodings.

       <u>cp1047</u> provides  support  for  EBCDIC-based  systems.   On  those  platforms,  <u>groff</u>  loads   <u>cp1047.tmac</u>
              automatically at startup.

       Because  different  input character codes constitute valid GNU <u>troff</u> input on ISO and EBCDIC systems, the
       <u>latin</u> macro files cannot be used on EBCDIC systems, and <u>cp1047</u> cannot be used on ISO systems.

   <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>packages</b>
       The macro packages in this section are not intended for stand-alone use, but can add functionality to any
       other macro package or to plain (“raw”) <u>groff</u> documents.

       <u>62bit</u>  provides macros for addition, multiplication, and  division  of  62-bit  integers  (allowing  safe
              multiplication of signed 31-bit integers, for example).

       <u>hdtbl</u>  allows the generation of tables using a syntax similar to the HTML table model.  This Heidelberger
              table  macro  package  is not a preprocessor, which can be useful if the contents of table entries
              are determined by macro calls or string interpolations.  Compare to <u><a href="../man1/tbl.1.html">tbl</a></u>(1).  It  works  only  with
              the <b>ps</b> and <b>pdf</b> output devices.  See <u><a href="../man7/groff_hdtbl.7.html">groff_hdtbl</a></u>(7).

       <u>papersize</u>
              enables  the  paper  format  to be set on the command line by giving a “<b>-d</b> <b>paper=</b><u>format</u>” option to
              <u>troff</u>.  Possible values for <u>format</u> are the ISO and DIN  formats  “<b>A0</b>–<b>A6</b>”,  “<b>B0</b>–<b>B6</b>”,  “<b>C0</b>–<b>C6</b>”,  and
              “<b>D0</b>–<b>D6</b>”;  the  U.S.  formats “<b>letter</b>”, “<b>legal</b>”, “<b>tabloid</b>”, “<b>ledger</b>”, “<b>statement</b>”, and “<b>executive</b>”;
              and the envelope formats “<b>com10</b>”, “<b>monarch</b>”, and “<b>DL</b>”.  All formats, even those for envelopes, are
              in portrait orientation: the length measurement is vertical.  Appending “l” (ell) to any of  these
              denotes  landscape  orientation instead.  This macro file assumes one-inch horizontal margins, and
              sets registers recognized by the <u>groff</u> <u>man</u>, <u>mdoc</u>, <u>mm</u>, <u>mom</u>,  and  <u>ms</u>  packages  to  configure  them
              accordingly.   If  you want different margins, you will need to use those packages' facilities, or
              <u>troff</u> <b>ll</b> and/or <b>po</b> requests to adjust them.  An  output  device  typically  requires  command-line
              options  <b>-p</b>  and <b>-l</b> to override the paper dimensions and orientation, respectively, defined in its
              <u>DESC</u> file; see subsection “Paper format” of <u><a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff</a></u>(1).  This  macro  file  is  normally  loaded  at
              startup by the <u>troffrc</u> file when formatting for a typesetting device (but not a terminal).

       <u>pdfpic</u> provides  a single macro, <b>PDFPIC</b>, to include a PDF graphic in a document using features of the <b>pdf</b>
              output driver.  For other output devices, <b>PDFPIC</b> calls <b>PSPIC</b>, with which it  shares  an  interface
              (see below).  This macro file is normally loaded at startup by the <u>troffrc</u> file.

       <u>pic</u>    supplies  definitions  of  the  macros  <b>PS</b>, <b>PE</b>, and <b>PF</b>, usable with the <u><a href="../man1/pic.1.html">pic</a></u>(1) preprocessor.  They
              center each picture.  Use it if your document does not use a full-service macro package,  or  that
              package  does  not  supply working <u>pic</u> macro definitions.  Except for <u>man</u> and <u>mdoc</u>, those provided
              with <u>groff</u> already do so (exception: <u>mm</u> employs the name <b>PF</b> for a different purpose).

       <u>pspic</u>  provides a macro, <b>PSPIC</b>, that includes a PostScript graphic in a document.  The <b>ps</b>, <b>dvi</b>, <b>html</b>, and
              <b>xhtml</b> output devices support such inclusions; for all other drivers, the image is replaced with  a
              rectangular border of the same size.  <u>pspic.tmac</u> is loaded at startup by the <u>troffrc</u> file.

              Its syntax is as follows.

                     <b>.PSPIC</b> [<b>-L</b>|<b>-R</b>|<b>-C</b>|<b>-I</b> <u>n</u>] <u>file</u> [<u>width</u> [<u>height</u>]]

              <u>file</u> is the name of the PostScript file; <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> give the desired width and height of the
              image.  If neither a <u>width</u> nor a <u>height</u> argument is specified, the image's natural width (as given
              in  the file's bounding box) or the current line length is used as the width, whatever is smaller.
              The <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> arguments may have scaling units attached; the default  scaling  unit  is  <b>i</b>.
              <b>PSPIC</b> scales the graphic uniformly in the horizontal and vertical directions so that it is no more
              than <u>width</u> wide and <u>height</u> high.  Option <b>-C</b> centers the graphic horizontally; this is the default.
              <b>-L</b>  and  <b>-R</b>  left- and right-align the graphic, respectively.  <b>-I</b> indents the graphic by <u>n</u> (with a
              default scaling unit of <b>m</b>).

              To use <b>PSPIC</b> within a diversion, we recommend extending it with the following code, assuring  that
              the diversion's width completely covers the image's width.

                     .am PSPIC
                     .  vpt 0
                     \h'(\\n[ps-offset]u + \\n[ps-deswid]u)'
                     .  sp -1
                     .  vpt 1
                     ..

              Failure  to  load  <b>PSPIC</b>'s  image argument is not an error.  (The <b>psbb</b> request does issue an error
              diagnostic.)  To make such a failure fatal, append to the <b>pspic*error-hook</b> macro.

                     .am pspic*error-hook
                     .  ab
                     ..

       <u>ptx</u>    provides a macro, <b>xx</b>, to format permuted index entries as produced by the GNU <u><a href="../man1/ptx.1.html">ptx</a></u>(1) program.   If
              your formatting needs differ, copy the macro into your document and adapt it to your needs.

       <u>rfc1345</u>
              defines special character escape sequences named for the glyph mnemonics specified in RFC 1345 and
              the digraph table of the Vim text editor.  See <u><a href="../man7/groff_rfc1345.7.html">groff_rfc1345</a></u>(7).

       <u>sboxes</u> offers an interface to the “<b>pdf:</b> <b>background</b>” device control command supported by <u><a href="../man1/gropdf.1.html">gropdf</a></u>(1).  Using
              this package, <u>groff</u> <u>ms</u> documents can draw colored rectangles beneath any output.

              <b>.BOXSTART</b> <b>SHADED</b> <u>color</u> <b>OUTLINED</b> <u>color</u> <b>INDENT</b> <u>size</u> <b>WEIGHT</b> <u>size</u>
                     begins  a box, where the argument after <b>SHADED</b> gives the fill color and that after <b>OUTLINED</b>
                     the border color.  Omit the former to get a borderless filled box  and  the  latter  for  a
                     border with no fill.  The specified <b>WEIGHT</b> is used if the box is <b>OUTLINED</b>.

                     <b>INDENT</b>  precedes  a value which leaves a gap between the border and the contents inside the
                     box.

                     Each <u>color</u> must be a defined <u>groff</u>  color  name,  and  each  <u>size</u>  a  valid  <u>groff</u>  numeric
                     expression.  The keyword/value pairs can be specified in any order.

              Boxes  can be stacked, so you can start a box within another box; usually the later boxes would be
              smaller than the containing box, but this is not enforced.  When using <b>BOXSTART</b>, the left position
              is the current indent minus the <b>INDENT</b> in the command, and the right position is the left position
              (calculated above) plus the current line length and twice the indent.

              <b>.BOXSTOP</b>
                     takes no parameters.  It closes the most recently  started  box  at  the  current  vertical
                     position after adding its <b>INDENT</b> spacing.

              Your  <u>groff</u> documents can conditionally exercise the <u>sboxes</u> macros.  The register <b>GSBOX</b> is defined
              if the package is loaded, and interpolates a true value if the <b>pdf</b> output device is in use.

              <u>sboxes</u> furthermore hooks into the <u><a href="../man7/groff_ms.7.html">groff_ms</a></u>(7) package to receive notifications when footnotes  are
              growing,  so  that it can close boxes on a page before footnotes are printed.  When that condition
              obtains, <u>sboxes</u> will close open boxes two points above the footnote separator and re-open them  on
              the next page.  (This amount probably will not match the box's <b>INDENT</b>.)

              See “Using PDF boxes with <u>groff</u> and the <u>ms</u> macros” for a demonstration.

       <u>trace</u>  aids the debugging of <u>groff</u> documents by tracing macro calls.  See <u><a href="../man7/groff_trace.7.html">groff_trace</a></u>(7).

       <u>www</u>    defines macros corresponding to HTML elements.  See <u><a href="../man7/groff_www.7.html">groff_www</a></u>(7).

</pre><h4><b>Naming</b></h4><pre>
       AT&amp;T  <u>nroff</u> and <u>troff</u> were implemented before the conventions of the modern C <u><a href="../man3/getopt.3.html">getopt</a></u>(3) call evolved, and
       used a naming scheme for macro packages that looks odd to modern eyes.   Macro  packages  were  typically
       loaded  using  the  <b>-m</b>  option  to  the  formatter;  when  directly  followed  by its argument without an
       intervening space, this looked like a long option preceded by a single minus—a sensation in the  computer
       stone  age.   Macro  packages therefore came to be known by names that started with the letter “m”, which
       was omitted from the name of the macro file as stored on disk.  For example, the manuscript macro package
       was stored as <u>tmac.s</u> and loaded with the option <b>-ms</b>.

       <u>groff</u> commands permit space between an option and its argument.  The syntax “<b>groff</b> <b>-m</b> <b>s</b>” makes the  macro
       file  name  more  clear  but  may  surprise users familiar with the original convention, unaware that the
       package's “real” name was “s” all  along.   For  such  packages  of  long  pedigree,  <u>groff</u>  accommodates
       different  users'  expectations  by  supplying  wrapper  macro  files that load the desired file with <b>mso</b>
       requests.  Thus, all of “<b>groff</b> <b>-m</b> <b>s</b>”, “<b>groff</b> <b>-m</b> <b>ms</b>”, “<b>groff</b> <b>-ms</b>”, and “<b>groff</b>  <b>-mms</b>”  serve  to  load  the
       manuscript macros.

       Wrappers are not provided for packages of more recent vintage, like <u>www.tmac</u>.

       As  noted  in  passing  above,  AT&amp;T  <u>troff</u> named macro files in the form <u>tmac.</u>name.  It has since become
       conventional in operating systems to use a suffixed file name extension to suggest a file type or format.

</pre><h4><b>Inclusion</b></h4><pre>
       The traditional method of employing a macro package is to specify the <b>-m</b> <u>package</u> option to the formatter,
       which then reads <u>package</u>'s macro file prior to any input files.  Historically, <u>package</u> was  sought  in  a
       file  named  <u>tmac.</u>package  (that  is, with a “<b>tmac.</b>” prefix).  GNU <u>troff</u> searches for package<u>.tmac</u> in the
       macro path; if not found, it looks for <u>tmac.</u>package instead, and vice versa.

       Alternatively, one could include a macro file by using the request “<b>.so</b> <u>file-name</u>” in the document; <u>file-</u>
       <u>name</u> is resolved relative to the location of the input document.  GNU <u>troff</u> offers an improved feature in
       the similar request “<b>mso</b>  <u>package-file-name</u>”,  which  searches  the  macro  path  for  <u>package-file-name</u>.
       Because  its  argument  is  a file name, its “<b>.tmac</b>” component must be included for the file to be found;
       however, as a convenience, if opening it fails, <b>mso</b> strips any such suffix and tries again with a “<b>tmac.</b>”
       prefix, and vice versa.

       If a sourced file requires preprocessing, for example if it includes <u>tbl</u> tables  or  <u>eqn</u>  equations,  the
       preprocessor  <u><a href="../man1/soelim.1.html">soelim</a></u>(1)  must  be used.  This can be achieved with a pipeline or, in <u>groff</u>, by specifying
       the <b>-s</b> option to the  formatter  (or  front  end).   <u><a href="../man1/man.1.html">man</a></u>(1)  librarian  programs  generally  call  <u>soelim</u>
       automatically.  (Macro packages themselves generally do not require preprocessing.)

</pre><h4><b>Writing</b> <b>macros</b></h4><pre>
       A <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) document is a text file that is enriched by predefined formatting constructs, such as requests,
       escape  sequences,  strings,  numeric  registers,  and  macros  from a macro package.  These elements are

       To give a document a personal style, it is most useful to extend the existing elements by  defining  some
       macros  for  repeating  tasks;  the  best  place  for  this is near the beginning of the document or in a
       separate file.

       Macros without arguments are just like strings.  But the full power of macros occurs when  arguments  are
       passed  with  a  macro  call.   Within  the  macro  definition, the arguments are available as the escape
       sequences <b>\$1</b>, ..., <b>\$9</b>, <b>\$[</b>...<b>]</b>, <b>\$*</b>, and <b>\$@</b>, the name under which the macro was called is in <b>\$0</b>,  and
       the number of arguments is in register <b>\n[.$]</b>; see <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7).

   <b>Draft</b> <b>mode</b>
       Writing groff macros is easy when the escaping mechanism is temporarily disabled.  In groff, this is done
       by  enclosing  the macro definition(s) within a pair of <b>.eo</b> and <b>.ec</b> requests.  Then the body in the macro
       definition is just like a normal part of the document — text  enhanced  by  calls  of  requests,  macros,
       strings, registers, etc.  For example, the code above can be written in a simpler way by

              .eo
              .ds midpart was called with the following
              .de print_args
              \f[I]\$0\f[] \*[midpart] \n[.$] arguments:
              \$*
              ..
              .ec

       Unfortunately,  draft  mode  cannot  be used universally.  Although it is good enough for defining normal
       macros, draft mode fails with advanced applications, such as indirectly defined strings, registers,  etc.
       An  optimal  way  is  to define and test all macros in draft mode and then do the backslash doubling as a
       final step; do not forget to remove the <u>.eo</u> request.

   <b>Tips</b> <b>for</b> <b>macro</b> <b>definitions</b>
       •      Start every line with a dot, for example, by using the groff request <b>.nop</b> for text lines, or write
              your own macro that handles also text lines with a leading dot.

                     .de Text
                     .  if (\\n[.$] == 0) \
                     .    return
                     .  nop \)\\$*\)
                     ..

       •      Write a comment macro that works both for copy and draft modes; since the escape character is  off
              in  draft  mode,  trouble  might  occur  when comment escape sequences are used.  For example, the
              following macro just ignores its arguments, so it acts like a comment line:

                     .de c
                     ..
                     .c This is like a comment line.

       •      In long macro definitions, make ample use of comment lines or almost-empty lines (this  is,  lines
              which have a leading dot and nothing else) for a better structuring.

       •      To  increase readability, use groff's indentation facility for requests and macro calls (arbitrary
              whitespace after the leading dot).

   <b>Diversions</b>
       Diversions can be used to implement quite  advanced  programming  constructs.   They  are  comparable  to
       pointers to large data structures in the C programming language, but their usage is quite different.

       In  their  simplest  form,  diversions  are  multi-line strings, but diversions get their power when used
       dynamically within macros.  The (formatted) information stored in a diversion can be retrieved by calling
       the diversion just like a macro.

       Most of the problems arising with diversions can be avoided if you remember that diversions always  store
       complete lines.  Using diversions when the line buffer has not been flushed produces strange results; not
       knowing  this,  many  people  get desperate about diversions.  To ensure that a diversion works, add line
       breaks at the right places.  To be safe, enclose everything that has to do with diversions within a  pair
       of  line breaks; for example, by explicitly using <b>.br</b> requests.  This rule should be applied to diversion
       definition, both inside and outside, and to all calls of diversions.  This is a bit of overkill,  but  it
       works nicely.

       (If you really need diversions which should ignore the current partial line, use environments to save the
       current partial line and/or use the <b>.box</b> request.)

       The  most  powerful feature using diversions is to start a diversion within a macro definition and end it
       within another macro.  Then everything between each  call  of  this  macro  pair  is  stored  within  the
       diversion and can be manipulated from within the macros.
