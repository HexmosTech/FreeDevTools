</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pcp-htop</b> - pcp-htop configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pcp-htop</b>  is  a  customizable performance metrics reporting tool.  It has a dynamic architecture, where a
       set of configuration files provide additional, optional meters and columns to extend  the  fixed  set  of
       display options provided by regular <b>htop</b>.

       These  configuration  files  can  be  provided  from both system-wide locations (first <u>/etc/pcp/htop</u> then
       <u>/usr/share/pcp/htop</u>) and  below  the  user's  home  directory  (usually  <u><a href="file:~/.config/htop">~/.config/htop</a></u>).   Within  these
       locations the <u>meters</u> and <u>columns</u> are scanned for dynamic Meter and Column specifications.

       Meters are displayed in the top part of the <b>pcp-htop</b> window, and columns are displayed in the lower part.
       Meters tend to display system-wide metrics, and Columns display metrics about individual processes.

       The  formats  are  similar but have slightly different requirements.  Both formats follow the common ini-
       style. Blank lines are ignored.  Lines starting with the "#" character are treated as comments.

</pre><h4><b>METERS</b></h4><pre>
       The following is an example configuration for a new Redis meter:

            [redisclient]
            caption = Redis clients
            type = bar
            blocked.metric = redis.blocked_clients
            blocked.color = blue
            blocked.label = blk
            clients.metric = redis.connected_clients
            clients.color = green
            clients.label = conn

       A configuration file can contain multiple meter definitions.  Each definition begins with  a  identifying
       name  enclosed by square brackets - <u>redisclient</u> in this example.  The name is used internally within <b>pcp-</b>
       <b>htop</b> and must be unique, must begin with an alphabetic  character,  and  may  subsequently  only  contain
       alphanumeric characters or the underscore character.  No whitespace or other characters are allowed.

       There are several parameters that define the way the meter will be displayed to the user.

       <b>caption</b>
            This  value  is displayed on the Setup screen once the meter has been selected.  A truncated version
            of the <u>caption</u> will also be displayed (followed by a colon) on the primary display while  the  meter
            is updating.

       <b>description</b>
            This  can be used to provide more detail during the meter selection process on the Setup screen, and
            if present it is displayed in the "Available Meters" column.  If not present, the  <b>caption</b>  will  be
            used for this.  If neither is present, the internal (mandatory) <b>name</b> will be used.

       <b>type</b> This  setting  allows  a preferred default meter type to be specified.  The associated value must be
            one of <u>bar</u>, <u>text</u>, <u>graph</u>, or <u>led</u>.  If no value is provided for a dynamic meter, the default value  of
            <u>text</u> will be used.

       <b>maximum</b>
            A  numeric  value  can  also  be  set to size the meter, such that values (e.g. for a <u>bar</u> type meter
            display) will be scaled within range zero to <u>maximum</u>.

       The remaining definition syntax describes the individual metric(s) which will  be  used  to  animate  the
       meter.   One or more metrics must be specified for each meter and there are several properties associated
       with each.  Once again, these metrics must be named (the same rules  described  above  for  meters  apply
       here) and the following properties can be configured:

       <b>name.metric</b>
            This  is  the  only  mandatory field and associates a PCP metric with the meter.  Values sampled for
            each metric at  runtime  provide  the  animation  visible  in  the  <b>pcp-htop</b>  display.   The  metric
            specification  can  be  either  a  PCP  metric  name  as  listed  by <b><a href="../man1/pminfo.1.html">pminfo</a></b>(1) or a "derived" metric
            expression.  The format for derived metric expressions  is  described  on  the  <b><a href="../man3/pmRegisterDerived.3.html">pmRegisterDerived</a></b>(3)
            manual page.

       <b>name.color</b>
            Setting  color to be used when rendering metric values.  Possible values are <u>red</u>, <u>green</u>, <u>blue</u>, <u>cyan</u>,
            <u>magenta</u>, <u>yellow</u>, <u>gray</u>, <u>darkgray</u> or <u>white</u>.

       <b>name.label</b>
            An optional, short label to display before the metric value.  The ":" character will be appended  to
            the <u>label</u> before the metric value part of the display.

       <b>name.suffix</b>
            An  optional, short suffix to display after the metric value.  Commonly used to indicate values as a
            percentage using a "%" <u>suffix</u> value and to provide the base unit of measurement.   Note  that  since
            PCP maintains units for metrics, for those metrics that have dimension in "space" (bytes, kilobytes,
            megabytes, etc), a suffix will be automatically appended.

</pre><h4><b>COLUMNS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  is  an  example  configuration  for  a  new column showing open file descriptors for each
       process:

            [openfds]
            heading = FDS
            caption = FDCOUNT
            description = Open file descriptors
            metric = proc.fd.count
            width = 3

       A configuration file can contain multiple column definitions.  Each definition begins with a  identifying
       name  enclosed  by square brackets - <u>openfds</u> in this example, and the same rules apply as described above
       for meter names.

       Each column must specify a metric.  Optional parameters can also be set.

       <b>metric</b>
            As with meters, the metric value must be either a PCP metric  name  as  listed  by  <b><a href="../man1/pminfo.1.html">pminfo</a></b>(1)  or  a
            derived  metric.   The  metric must have an instance domain (set of values) and that instance domain
            must map to the set of processes with the instance  identifier  being  PIDs  (process  identifiers).
            Typically  this  will  be metrics from the <u>proc</u> or <u>hotproc</u> namespace (<b><a href="../man1/pmdaproc.1.html">pmdaproc</a></b>(1)), but metrics from
            other domains (<b><a href="../man1/pmdabcc.1.html">pmdabcc</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/pmdabpf.1.html">pmdabpf</a></b>(1), etc) that have per-process values are equally applicable.

       <b>width</b>
            Column width to use when displaying values for the metric.  A negative value can be used to  specify
            left  alignment.  An upper column limit of 28 characters is enforced.  The default column width is 5
            characters.

       <b>heading</b>
            The short title that will be displayed at the head of the column - usually  a  short,  cryptic,  all
            uppercase string.

       <b>caption</b>
            A  short identifying word presented to users on the Setup screen under both the Available and Active
            Columns lists.

       <b>description</b>
            Text that assists users to understand the meaning of this column when it is being presented via  the
            Setup screen in the Available Columns list.
