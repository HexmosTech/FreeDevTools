</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       main.conf - ConnMan configuration file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/connman/main.conf</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>main.conf</b>  is  a configuration file for ConnMan. The configuration file is optional but it can be used to
       set up various aspects of ConnMan's behavior. The location of the file may be changed through use of  the
       <b>--config=</b> argument for <b><a href="../man8/connman.8.html">connman</a></b>(8).

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration file consists of sections (groups) of key-value pairs.  Lines beginning with a '#' and
       blank lines are considered comments.  Sections are started  by  a  header  line  containing  the  section
       enclosed  in  '['  and ']', and ended implicitly by the start of the next section or the end of the file.
       Each key-value pair must be contained in a section.

       Description of sections and available keys follows:

   <b>[General]</b>
       This section is the only mandatory section of the configuration file.

       <b>InputRequestTimeout=</b><u>secs</u>
              Set input request timeout. Default is 120 seconds The request  for  inputs  like  passphrase  will
              timeout  after certain amount of time. Use this setting to increase the value in case of different
              user interface designs.

       <b>BrowserLaunchTimeout=</b><u>secs</u>
              Set browser launch timeout. Default is 300 seconds The request for launching a browser for  portal
              pages will timeout after certain amount of time. Use this setting to increase the value in case of
              different user interface designs.

       <b>BackgroundScanning=true</b> | <b>false</b>
              Enable  background  scanning.  Default  is true.  If wifi is disconnected, the background scanning
              will follow a simple backoff mechanism from 3s up to 5 minutes. Then, it will stay  in  5  minutes
              unless  user  specifically asks for scanning through a D-Bus call. If so, the mechanism will start
              again from 3s. This feature activates also the background scanning while being connected, which is
              required for roaming on wifi.  When BackgroundScanning is false, ConnMan will not perform any scan
              regardless of wifi is connected or not, unless it is requested by the user through a D-Bus call.

       <b>UseGatewaysAsTimeservers=true</b>| <b>false</b>
              Assume that service gateways also function as timeservers.  Default is false.

       <b>FallbackTimeservers=</b><u>server</u>[,...]
              List of Fallback timeservers separated by ",".  These timeservers are used for NTP sync when there
              are no timeservers set by the user or by the service, and when UseGatewaysAsTimeservers  =  false.
              These can contain a mixed combination of fully qualified domain names, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

       <b>FallbackNameservers=</b><u>server</u>[,...]
              List  of  fallback  nameservers  separated by "," appended to the list of nameservers given by the
              service. The nameserver entries must be in numeric format, host names are ignored.

       <b>DefaultAutoConnectTechnologies=</b><u>technology</u>[,...]
              List of technologies that are marked autoconnectable by default,  separated  by  commas  ",".  The
              default   value   for  this  entry  when  empty  is  ethernet,wifi,cellular.   Services  that  are
              automatically connected must have been set up and saved to storage beforehand.

       <b>DefaultFavoriteTechnologies=</b><u>technology</u>[,...]
              List of technologies that are marked favorite by default, separated by  commas  ",".  The  default
              value for this entry when empty is ethernet. Connects to services from this technology even if not
              setup and saved to storage.

       <b>AlwaysConnectedTechnologies=</b><u>technology</u>[,...]
              List  of  technoolgies  which  are  always  connected  regardless of PreferredTechnologies setting
              (AutoConnect = true). The default value is empty and this feature is  disabled  unless  explicitly
              enabled in the config file.

       <b>PreferredTechnologies=</b><u>technology</u>[,...]
              List of preferred technologies from the most preferred one to the least preferred one separated by
              commas  ",".   Services of the listed technology type will be tried one by one in the order given,
              until one of them gets connected or they are all tried. A service of a preferred  technology  type
              in  state  'ready' will get the default route when compared to another preferred type further down
              the list with state 'ready' or with a non-preferred type; a service of a preferred technology type
              in state 'online' will get the default route when compared to either a  non-preferred  type  or  a
              preferred type further down in the list.

       <b>NetworkInterfaceBlacklist=</b><u>interface</u>[,...]
              List of blacklisted network interfaces separated by ",".  Found interfaces will be compared to the
              list  and will not be handled by connman, if their first characters match any of the list entries.
              Default value is vmnet,vboxnet,virbr,ifb.

       <b>AllowHostnameUpdates=true</b> | <b>false</b>
              Allow connman to change the system hostname. This can  happen  for  example  if  we  receive  DHCP
              hostname option.  Default value is true.

       <b>AllowDomainnameUpdates=true</b> | <b>false</b>
              Allow  connman  to  change  the  system domainname. This can happen for example if we receive DHCP
              domainname option.  Default value is true.

       <b>SingleConnectedTechnology=true</b> | <b>false</b>
              Keep only a single connected technology at any time. When a new service is connected by  the  user
              or a better one is found according to PreferredTechnologies, the new service is kept connected and
              all the other previously connected services are disconnected. With this setting it does not matter
              whether  the  previously connected services are in 'online' or 'ready' states, the newly connected
              service is the only one that will be kept connected. A service connected by the user will be  used
              until  going  out  of  network  coverage.  With this setting enabled applications will notice more
              network breaks than normal. Note this options can't be used with VPNs.  Default value is false.

       <b>TetheringTechnologies=</b><u>technology</u>[,...]
              List of technologies that are allowed to enable tethering separated by ",".  The default value  is
              wifi,bluetooth,gadget. Only those technologies listed here are used for tethering. If one wants to
              tether  ethernet,  then  add  "ethernet" in the list.  NOTE that if ethernet tethering is enabled,
              then a DHCP server is started on all  ethernet  interfaces.  Tethered  ethernet  should  never  be
              connected  to corporate or home network as it will disrupt normal operation of these networks. Due
              to this ethernet is not tethered by default. Do not activate ethernet tethering unless you  really
              know what you are doing.

       <b>PersistentTetheringMode=true</b> | <b>false</b>
              Restore  earlier  tethering status when returning from offline mode, re-enabling a technology, and
              after restarts and reboots.  Default value is false.

       <b>Enable6to4=true</b> | <b>false</b>
              Automatically enable Anycast 6to4 if possible. This is not recommended, as the use  of  6to4  will
              generally  lead  to  a  severe  degradation of connection quality.  See RFC6343.  Default value is
              false (as recommended by RFC6343 section 4.1).

       <b>VendorClassID=</b><u>string</u>
              Set DHCP option 60 (Vendor Class ID) to the given string. This option can be used by DHCP  servers
              to identify specific clients without having to rely on MAC address ranges, etc

       <b>EnableOnlineCheck=true</b> | <b>false</b>
              Enable  or disable use of HTTP GET as an online status check.  When a service is in a READY state,
              and is selected as default, ConnMan will issue an HTTP  GET  request  to  verify  that  end-to-end
              connectivity  is  successful. Only then the service will be transitioned to ONLINE state.  If this
              setting is false, the default service will remain in READY state.  Default value is <b>true</b>.

              <b>NOTE:</b> <b>EnableOnlineCheck</b> is deprecated; please use <b>OnlineCheckMode</b> with a mode of  either  <b>one-shot</b>
              or <b>none</b>.

       <b>OnlineCheckMode=</b><u>mode</u>
              This  indicates  the  "online"  HTTP-based  Internet  reachability  check  mode and supercedes and
              deprecates <b>EnableOnlineCheck</b>. Possible values for <u>mode</u> are <b>none</b>,  <b>one-shot</b>,  and  <b>continuous</b>.  The
              default value of <u>mode</u> is <b>one-shot</b>.

              In <b>none</b> mode, there are no "online" HTTP-based Internet reachability checks. Any connected service
              and the manager state will terminate at the "ready" state and will not progress to "online".

              In  <b>one-shot</b> mode, there is a single, one-shot "online" HTTP-based Internet reachability check for
              the default service. When the check succeeds, the associated service and the  manager  state  will
              terminate  at  the  "online"  state.  When  the check fails, subsequent checks will be rescheduled
              according to <b>OnlineCheckIntervalStyle</b>, <b>OnlineCheckInitialInterval</b>, and <b>OnlineCheckMaxInterval</b>  and
              will continue indefinitely until one succeeds or unti the service is disconnected.

              In  <b>continuous</b>  mode,  there  are  ongoing "online" HTTP-based Internet reachability check for the
              default service. As with "one-shot" mode, when the first check succeeds,  the  associated  service
              and  the manager state will terminate at the "online" state. Thereafter, subsequent checks will be
              scheduled according to <b>OnlineCheckIntervalStyle</b> and <b>OnlineCheckMaxInterval</b>. When the check  fails,
              subsequent     checks    will    be    rescheduled    according    to    <b>OnlineCheckIntervalStyle</b>,
              <b>OnlineCheckInitialInterval</b>, and <b>OnlineCheckMaxInterval</b>. When and  if  <b>OnlineCheckFailuresThreshold</b>
              is  met,  the  service  and manager state will be demoted to "ready" and the service will have its
              "Error" property set to "online-check-failed"  while  subsequent  checks  will  continue.  In  the
              interim,  if  available,  another service may be promoted to the default service and online checks
              will be initiated for it. When and if, for the demoted service,  <b>OnlineCheckSuccessesThreshold</b>  is
              met,  the  service  "Error"  property  will be cleared and the service state promoted to "online",
              potentially causing it to become the default service again.

       <b>OnlineCheckIPv4URL=</b><u>url,</u><b>OnlineCheckIPv6URL=</b><u>url</u>
              Urls (IPv4 and IPv6 respectively) used during the online status check.  Please refer to the README
              for more detailed information.  Default values are <a href="http://ipv4.connman.net/online/status.html">http://ipv4.connman.net/online/status.html</a>  and
              <a href="http://ipv6.connman.net/online/status.html">http://ipv6.connman.net/online/status.html</a> respectively.

       <b>OnlineCheckConnectTimeout=</b><u>secs[.milliseconds]</u>
              The  time,  in decimal seconds (for example, 12.3), to wait for a successful TCP connection to the
              host associated with <b>OnlineCheckIPv4URL</b> or <b>OnlineCheckIPv6URL</b> (see above). Connections  that  take
              longer  than  <b>OnlineCheckConnectTimeout</b>  will  be  aborted.  The default value is zero ('0') which
              indicates that no explicit connection timeout will be used, leaving the timeout to the  underlying
              operating system and network stack.

       <b>OnlineCheckInitialInterval=</b><u>interval,</u><b>OnlineCheckMaxInterval=</b><u>interval</u>
              Range  of  intervals  between  two  online  check  requests.   Please refer to the README for more
              detailed information.  Default values are 1 and 12 respectively.

       <b>OnlineCheckIntervalStyle=fibonacci</b> | <b>geometric</b>
              The style or mathematical series function used to compute the actual time, in seconds, between two
              "ready" to "online" HTTP-based Internet reachability checks. The value  of  which  may  be  either
              "geometric" or "fibonacci" with a default value of "geometric".

              The  "geometric"  style  or  function  simply  takes  the square of the online check interval (see
              OnlineCheckInitialInterval and OnlineCheckMaxInterval above). For example, at a check interval  of
              6, the time, in seconds, is 36 (6^2) seconds.

              The  "fibonacci"  style  or function takes the value of the Fibonacci sequence at the online check
              interval. For example, at a check interval of 6, the time, in seconds, is 8 seconds.

              The "fibonacci" series and style is more aggressive in check rate up to 12 steps (its  equivalence
              point  with  "geometric" at 144 seconds) than "geometric" but backs off far more aggressively past
              that point reaching an hour at interval 19 which "geometric" does not reach until interval 60.

       <b>EnableOnlineToReadyTransition=true</b> | <b>false</b>
              In addition to EnableOnlineCheck setting, enable or disable use of HTTP GET to detect the loss  of
              end-to-end connectivity.  If this setting is false, when the default service transitions to ONLINE
              state,  the  HTTP GET request is no more called until next cycle, initiated by a transition of the
              default service to DISCONNECT state.  If this setting is true, the HTTP GET request  keeps  beeing
              called  to guarantee that end-to-end connectivity is still successful. If not, the default service
              will transition  to  READY  state,  enabling  another  service  to  become  the  default  one,  in
              replacement.  Default value is <b>false</b>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>  <b>EnableOnlineToReadyTransition</b>  is  deprecated;  please  use  <b>OnlineCheckMode</b> with a mode of
              either <b>continuous</b> or <b>none</b>.

       <b>OnlineCheckFailuresThreshold=</b><u>failures</u>
              When <b>OnlineCheckMode</b> is "continuous", this  is  the  number  of  failed  back-to-back  "ready"  to
              "online"  HTTP-based Internet reachability checks that will be allowed before marking a service as
              "failed" from a reachability perspective, sorting it at a lower priority than other  services  not
              so marked.

              Lower values may result in higher-frequency network service cycling while higher values may result
              in  a longer period of time before failing from a non-Internet reachable service to one that might
              be.

              See <b>OnlineCheckIntervalStyle</b>, <b>OnlineCheckInitialInterval</b>,  and  <b>OnlineCheckMaxInterval</b>  for  other
              values that influence network service failure/recovery transition time.  The default value is 6.

       <b>OnlineCheckSuccessesThreshold=</b><u>successes</u>
              When  <b>OnlineCheckMode</b>  is  "continuous",  this is the number of successful back-to-back "ready" to
              "online" HTTP-based Internet reachability checks that must be met before  clearing  a  service  as
              "failed"  from  a  reachability  perspective  and  allowing it to transition to the "online" state
              again, allowing it to sort back to a higher priority relative to other network services.

              Lower values may result in higher-frequency network service cycling while higher values may result
              in a longer period of time before transitioning back  to  more  a  preferred,  Internet  reachable
              network service.

              See  <b>OnlineCheckIntervalStyle</b>,  <b>OnlineCheckInitialInterval</b>,  and  <b>OnlineCheckMaxInterval</b> for other
              values that influence network service failure/recovery transition time.

              The default value is 6.

       <b>AutoConnectRoamingServices=true</b> | <b>false</b>
              Automatically connect roaming services. This is not recommended unless you know you won't have any
              billing problem.  Default value is false.

       <b>AddressConflictDetection=true</b> | <b>false</b>
              Enable or disable the implementation of IPv4 address  conflict  detection  according  to  RFC5227.
              ConnMan  will  send probe ARP packets to see if an IPv4 address is already in use before assigning
              the address to an interface.  If an address conflict occurs for a statically  configured  address,
              an IPv4LL address will be chosen instead (according to RFC3927). If an address conflict occurs for
              an  address  offered via DHCP, ConnMan send a DHCP DECLINE once and for the second conflict resort
              to finding an IPv4LL address.  Default value is false.

       <b>Localtime=</b><u>string</u>
              Path to localtime file. Defaults to /etc/localtime.

       <b>RegdomFollowsTimezone=</b><u>true</u> | <b>false</b>
              Enable regdomain to be changed along timezone changes. With this option set to true each time  the
              timezone    changes    the   first   present   ISO3166   country   code   is   being   read   from
              <a href="file:/usr/share/zoneinfo/zone1970.tab">/usr/share/zoneinfo/zone1970.tab</a> and set as regdom value.  Default value is false.

       <b>ResolvConf=</b><u>string</u>
              Path to resolv.conf file. If the file does not exist, but intermediate directories exist, it  will
              be  created.   If  this  option  is  not  set, it tries to write into /run/connman/resolv.conf and
              fallbacks to <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> if it fails (/run/connman does not exist or is not  writeable).   If
              you do not want to update resolv.conf, you can set /dev/null.
