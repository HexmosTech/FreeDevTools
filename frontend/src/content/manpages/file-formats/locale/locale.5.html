</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       locale - describes a locale definition file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>locale</b> definition file contains all the information that the <b><a href="../man1/localedef.1.html">localedef</a></b>(1) command needs to convert it
       into the binary locale database.

       The  definition files consist of sections which each describe a locale category in detail.  See <b><a href="../man7/locale.7.html">locale</a></b>(7)
       for additional details for these categories.

   <b>Syntax</b>
       The locale definition file starts with a header that may consist of the following keywords:

       <u>escape_char</u>
              is followed by a character that should be used as the escape-character for the rest of the file to
              mark characters that should be interpreted in a special way.  It defaults to the backslash (\).

       <u>comment_char</u>
              is followed by a character that will be used as the comment-character for the rest  of  the  file.
              It defaults to the number sign (#).

       The  locale  definition  has  one  part  for  each locale category.  Each part can be copied from another
       existing locale or can be defined from scratch.  If the category should be copied, the only valid keyword
       in the definition is <u>copy</u> followed by the name of the locale in double quotes  which  should  be  copied.
       The  exceptions  for  this  rule  are  <b>LC_COLLATE</b>  and <b>LC_CTYPE</b> where a <u>copy</u> statement can be followed by
       locale-specific rules and selected overrides.

       When defining a locale or a category from scratch, an existing system- provided  locale  definition  file
       should be used as a reference to follow common glibc conventions.

   <b>Locale</b> <b>category</b> <b>sections</b>
       The following category sections are defined by POSIX:

       •  <b>LC_CTYPE</b>

       •  <b>LC_COLLATE</b>

       •  <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>

       •  <b>LC_MONETARY</b>

       •  <b>LC_NUMERIC</b>

       •  <b>LC_TIME</b>

       In addition, since glibc 2.2, the GNU C library supports the following nonstandard categories:

       •  <b>LC_ADDRESS</b>

       •  <b>LC_IDENTIFICATION</b>

       •  <b>LC_MEASUREMENT</b>

       •  <b>LC_NAME</b>

       •  <b>LC_PAPER</b>

       •  <b>LC_TELEPHONE</b>

       See <b><a href="../man7/locale.7.html">locale</a></b>(7) for a more detailed description of each category.

   <b>LC_ADDRESS</b>
       The definition starts with the string <u>LC_ADDRESS</u> in the first column.

       The following keywords are allowed:

       <u>postal_fmt</u>
              followed by a string containing field descriptors that define the format used for postal addresses
              in the locale.  The following field descriptors are recognized:

              %n     Person's name, possibly constructed with the <b>LC_NAME</b> <u>name_fmt</u> keyword (since glibc 2.24).

              %a  Care of person, or organization.

              %f  Firm name.

              %d  Department name.

              %b  Building name.

              %s  Street or block (e.g., Japanese) name.

              %h  House number or designation.

              %N  Insert  an  end-of-line  if the previous descriptor's value was not an empty string; otherwise
                  ignore.

              %t  Insert a space if the previous descriptor's value was not an empty string; otherwise ignore.

              %r  Room number, door designation.

              %e  Floor number.

              %C  Country designation, from the <u>country_post</u> keyword.

              %l  Local township within town or city (since glibc 2.24).

              %z  Zip number, postal code.

              %T  Town, city.

              %S  State, province, or prefecture.

              %c  Country, as taken from data record.

              Each field descriptor may have an 'R' after the '%' to specify that the information is taken  from
              a Romanized version string of the entity.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The   collective  GNU  C  library  community  wisdom  regarding  <u>abday</u>,  <u>day</u>,  <u>week</u>,  <u>first_weekday</u>,  and
       <u>first_workday</u> states at https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Locales the following:

       •  The value of the second <u>week</u> list item specifies the base of the <u>abday</u> and <u>day</u> lists.

       •  <u>first_weekday</u> specifies the offset of the first day-of-week in the <u>abday</u> and <u>day</u> lists.

       •  For compatibility reasons, all glibc locales should set the value of the  second  <u>week</u>  list  item  to
          <b>19971130</b>  (Sunday)  and  base  the  <u>abday</u>  and  <u>day</u>  lists  appropriately,  and  set <u>first_weekday</u> and
          <u>first_workday</u> to <b>1</b> or <b>2</b>, depending on whether the week and work week  actually  starts  on  Sunday  or
          Monday for the locale.
