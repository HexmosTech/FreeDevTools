</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hosts_options - host access control language extensions

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes extensions to the language described in the <a href="../man5/hosts_access.5.html">hosts_access</a>(5) document.

       The extensible language uses the following format:

          daemon_list : client_list : option : option ...

       The  first  two fields are described in the <a href="../man5/hosts_access.5.html">hosts_access</a>(5) manual page.  The remainder of the rules is a
       list of zero or more options.  Any ":" characters within options should be protected with a backslash.

       An option is of the form "keyword" or "keyword value". Options are processed in the specified order. Some
       options are subjected to %&lt;letter&gt; substitutions. For the sake of backwards  compatibility  with  earlier
       versions, an "=" is permitted between keyword and value.

</pre><h4><b>LOGGING</b></h4><pre>
       severity mail.info

       severity notice
              Change  the  severity  level  at which the event will be logged. Facility names (such as mail) are
              optional, and are not supported on systems with older syslog implementations. The severity  option
              can be used to emphasize or to ignore specific events.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       allow

       deny   Grant (deny) service. These options must appear at the end of a rule.

       The  <u>allow</u>  and <u>deny</u> keywords make it possible to keep all access control rules within a single file, for
       example in the <u>hosts.allow</u> file.

       To permit access from specific hosts only:

          ALL: .friendly.domain: ALLOW
          ALL: ALL: DENY

       To permit access from all hosts except a few trouble makers:

          ALL: .bad.domain: DENY
          ALL: ALL: ALLOW

       Notice the leading dot on the domain name patterns.

</pre><h4><b>RUNNING</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       aclexec shell_command
              Execute, in a  child  process,  the  specified  shell  command,  after  performing  the  %&lt;letter&gt;
              expansions  described  in  the  <a href="../man5/hosts_access.5.html">hosts_access</a>(5)  manual page.  The command is executed with stdin,
              stdout and stderr connected to the null device, so that it won't mess up the conversation with the
              client host. Example:

                 smtp : ALL : aclexec checkdnsbl %a

              executes, in a background child process, the shell command "checkdnsbl %a" after replacing  %a  by
              the address of the remote host.

              The connection will be allowed or refused depending on whether the command returns a true or false
              exit status.

       spawn shell_command
              Execute,  in  a  child  process,  the  specified  shell  command,  after  performing the %&lt;letter&gt;
              expansions described in the <a href="../man5/hosts_access.5.html">hosts_access</a>(5) manual page.  The  command  is  executed  with  stdin,
              stdout and stderr connected to the null device, so that it won't mess up the conversation with the
              client host. Example:

                 spawn (/usr/sbin/safe_finger -l @%h | /usr/bin/mail root) &amp;

              executes,  in a background child process, the shell command "safe_finger -l @%h | mail root" after
              replacing %h by the name or address of the remote host.

              The example uses the "safe_finger" command instead of  the  regular  "finger"  command,  to  limit
              possible  damage  from  data  sent  by the finger server. The "safe_finger" command is part of the
              daemon wrapper package; it is a wrapper around the regular finger command that  filters  the  data
              sent by the remote host.

       twist shell_command
              Replace  the  current  process by an instance of the specified shell command, after performing the
              %&lt;letter&gt; expansions described in the <a href="../man5/hosts_access.5.html">hosts_access</a>(5) manual page.  Stdin, stdout and  stderr  are
              connected to the client process. This option must appear at the end of a rule.

              To send a customized bounce message to the client instead of running the real ftp daemon:

                 in.ftpd : ... : twist <a href="file:/bin/echo">/bin/echo</a> 421 Some bounce message

              For an alternative way to talk to client processes, see the <u>banners</u> option below.

              To run /some/other/in.telnetd without polluting its command-line array or its process environment:

                 in.telnetd : ... : twist PATH=/some/other; exec in.telnetd

              Warning:   in  case  of  UDP  services,  do not twist to commands that use the standard I/O or the
              <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a>(2)/<a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a>(2) routines  to  communicate  with  the  client  process;  UDP  requires  other  I/O
              primitives.

</pre><h4><b>NETWORK</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       keepalive
              Causes  the  server  to  periodically  send a message to the client.  The connection is considered
              broken when the client does not respond. The keepalive option can be useful when  users  turn  off
              their  machine  while  it  is still connected to a server.  The keepalive option is not useful for
              datagram (UDP) services.

       linger number_of_seconds
              Specifies how long the kernel will try to deliver not-yet delivered data after the server  process
              closes a connection.

</pre><h4><b>USERNAME</b> <b>LOOKUP</b></h4><pre>
       rfc931 [ timeout_in_seconds ]
              Look  up  the  client  user name with the RFC 931 (TAP, IDENT, RFC 1413) protocol.  This option is
              silently ignored in case of services based on transports other than TCP.   It  requires  that  the
              client  system  runs  an  RFC 931 (IDENT, etc.) -compliant daemon, and may cause noticeable delays
              with connections from non-UNIX clients.   The  timeout  period  is  optional.  If  no  timeout  is
              specified a compile-time defined default value is taken.

</pre><h4><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b></h4><pre>
       banners /some/directory
              Look  for  a  file  in  `/some/directoryÂ´  with  the  same name as the daemon process (for example
              in.telnetd for the telnet service), and copy its contents to the client.  Newline  characters  are
              replaced by carriage-return newline, and %&lt;letter&gt; sequences are expanded (see the <a href="../man5/hosts_access.5.html">hosts_access</a>(5)
              manual page).

              The  tcp  wrappers  source  code  distribution  provides  a sample makefile (Banners.Makefile) for
              convenient banner maintenance.

              Warning: banners are supported for connection-oriented (TCP) network services only.

       nice [ number ]
              Change the nice value of the process (default 10).  Specify a positive value  to  spend  more  CPU
              resources on other processes.

       setenv name value
              Place  a  (name,  value)  pair  into  the process environment. The value is subjected to %&lt;letter&gt;
              expansions and may contain whitespace (but leading and trailing blanks are stripped off).

              Warning: many network daemons reset their environment before spawning a login or shell process.

       umask 022
              Like the umask command that is built into the shell. An umask of  022  prevents  the  creation  of
              files with group and world write permission.  The umask argument should be an octal number.

       user nobody

       user nobody.kmem
              Assume  the  privileges of the "nobody" userid (or user "nobody", group "kmem"). The first form is
              useful with inetd implementations that run all services with root privilege. The  second  form  is
              useful for services that need special group privileges only.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       When  a  syntax  error  is  found  in an access control rule, the error is reported to the syslog daemon;
       further options will be ignored, and service is denied.
