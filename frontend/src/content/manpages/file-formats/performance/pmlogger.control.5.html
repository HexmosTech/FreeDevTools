       <b>pmlogger.control</b> - control files for Performance Co-Pilot archiving

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Historical  archiving of performance data for Performance Co-Pilot (see <b><a href="../man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro</a></b>(1)) uses <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1) and
       one or more instances of <b>pmlogger</b> may be managed by <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily</a></b>(1).

       <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check</a></b>(1) may be run at any time of the day and is intended to check  that  the  desired  set  of
       <b>pmlogger</b>  processes  are  running.   If  not,  it  (re-)starts any missing logger processes.  By default,
       <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check</a></b>(1) also calls  <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily</a></b>(1)  with  a  <b>-K</b>  option  to  execute  any  required  archive
       compression tasks.

       <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily</a></b>(1)  is  intended  to  be  run once per day, preferably in the early morning, as soon after
       midnight as practicable.  Its task is to aggregate, rotate and perform general housekeeping  for  one  or
       more sets of PCP archives.

       Both  <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check</a></b>(1)  and  <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily</a></b>(1)  operate  on a family of shared control files, namely the
       <u>$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH</u> file and files within the <u>$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH.d</u> directory.   These  files
       must not be writable by any user other than root.

       The  control  file(s)  should  be customized according to the following rules that define for the current
       version (1.1) of the control file format.

       1.  Lines beginning with a ``#'' are comments.  A special case is  lines  beginning  ``#!#'';  these  are
           control lines for a <b>pmlogger</b> that has been stopped using <b><a href="../man1/pmlogctl.1.html">pmlogctl</a></b>(1).
       2.  Lines  beginning  with a ``$'' are assumed to be assignments to environment variables in the style of
           <b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1), and all text following the ``$'' will be <b>eval</b>'ed by the script reading the control  file,  and
           the  corresponding  variable  exported  into the environment.  This is particularly useful to set and
           export variables into the environment of the administrative scripts, e.g.
               $ PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=20
           If the value to the right of the ``='' contains any white space, then the value should be enclosed in
           double (") or single (') quotes.
       3.  There <b>must</b> be a version line in the control file of the form:
               $version=1.1
       4.  Fields within a line of the control file(s) are usually separated by  one  or  more  spaces  or  tabs
           (although refer to the description of the <u>directory</u> field below for some important exceptions).
       5.  There  should be one line in the control file(s) for each <b>pmlogger</b> instance with at least 4 fields of
           the form:
               <u>host</u> <u>primary</u> <u>socks</u> <u>directory</u> <u>args</u> ...
       6.  The <u>host</u> field is the name of the host that is  the  source  of  the  performance  metrics  for  this
           <b>pmlogger</b> instance.  The reserved word <b>LOCALHOSTNAME</b> will be replaced by the name of the local host.
       7.  The <u>primary</u> field indicates if this is a primary <b>pmlogger</b> instance (<b>y</b>) or not (<b>n</b>).  Since the primary
           logger must run on the local host, and there may be at most one primary logger for a particular host,
           this  field  can be <b>y</b> for at most one <b>pmlogger</b> instance, in which case the host name must be the name
           of the local host (or <b>LOCALHOSTNAME</b>).
       8.  The <u>socks</u> field indicates if this <b>pmlogger</b>  instance  needs  to  be  started  under  the  control  of
           <b><a href="../man1/pmsocks.1.html">pmsocks</a></b>(1) to connect to a <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) through a firewall (<b>y</b> or <b>n</b>).
       9.  The  <u>directory</u>  field  is a directory name.  All archive files associated with this <b>pmlogger</b> instance
           will be created in this directory, and this will be the current directory for the  execution  of  any
           programs  required  to  maintain those archives.  A useful convention is that primary logger archives
           for the local host with hostname <u>myhost</u> are maintained in the directory <u>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/myhost</u> (this
           is where the default <b>pmlogger</b> start-up script in <u>$PCP_RC_DIR/pcp</u> will  create  the  archives),  while
           archives for the remote host <u>mumble</u> are maintained in <u>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/mumble</u>.
       10. The  <u>directory</u> field may contain embedded shell syntax that will be evaluated by <b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1) to produce the
           real directory name to be used.  The allowed constructs are:
           • Any text (including white space) enclosed with <b>$(</b> and <b>)</b> will be interpreted as a shell command.
           • Any text (including white space) enclosed with <b>`</b> and <b>`</b> (back quotes) will be interpreted as a shell
             command.
           • Within a single line only one style of embedded shell command is  allowed,  so  either  <b>$(</b>...<b>)</b>   or
             <b>`</b>...<b>`</b>, but not both.
           • An  initial  double  quote  (") followed by arbitrary text (including white space, but excluding an
             embedded double quote) and a final double quote.
           • An initial single quote (') followed by arbitrary text (including white  space,  but  excluding  an
             embedded single quote) and a final single quote.
           • Any word containing a <b>$</b> (assumed to introduce an environment variable name).
       11. In  the  <u>directory</u>  field,  the reserved word <b>LOCALHOSTNAME</b> will be replaced by the name of the local
           host.
       12. The optional <u>args</u> field and any remaining fields  are  interpreted  as  arguments  to  be  passed  to
           <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1).  Most typically this would be at least the <b>-c</b> option to specify the metrics to be logged
           and the logging frequencies.

       The  following  sample  control  lines specify a primary logger on the local host (<u>bozo</u>), and non-primary
       loggers to collect and log performance metrics from the hosts <u>wobbly</u>, <u>boing</u>  and  the  local  host  (i.e.
       <u>bozo</u>).

       $version=1.1
       bozo          y  n  $PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/bozo   -c config.default
       wobbly        n  n  "/store/wobbly/$(date +%Y)"  -c ./wobbly.config
       boing         n  n  $PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/boing   -c ./pmlogger.config
       LOCALHOSTNAME n  n /cluster/LOCALHOSTNAME   -c ./precious.config

</pre><h4><b>SCHEDULED</b> <b>EXECUTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  periodic  execution of <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily</a></b>(1) is controlled by either <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) or
       <b><a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron</a></b>(8).

       Typical <b><a href="../man5/crontab.5.html">crontab</a></b>(5) entries are provided in <u>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/crontab</u> (unless installed by default
       in <u><a href="file:/etc/cron.d">/etc/cron.d</a></u> already) and shown below.

       # daily processing of archives
       14      0       *       *       *       $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_daily
       # every 30 minutes, check pmlogger instances are running
       25,55   *       *       *       *       $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_check

       When using <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) on Linux, no <b>crontab</b> entries are needed as the timer mechanism provided by  <b>systemd</b>
       is used instead to achieve the same period execution as the crontab example above.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH</u>
            the PCP logger control file.  For a new installation this file contains no <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1) control lines
            (the  real  control  files  are  all in the <u>$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH.d</u> directory), but this file is
            still processed to support any legacy configurations therein from earlier PCP releases.
            <b>Warning</b>: this file must not be writable by any user other than root.

       <u>$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH.d</u>
            optional directory containing additional PCP logger control files, with one  or  more  per  <b>pmlogger</b>
            specification per file.
            <b>Warning</b>: the files herein must not be writable by any user other than root.

       <u>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/crontab</u>
            sample  crontab  for automated script execution by $PCP_USER (or root).  Exists only if the platform
            does not support the <a href="file:/etc/cron.d">/etc/cron.d</a> mechanism.

</pre><h4><b>PCP</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_</b> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used  by
       PCP.   On  each  installation, the file <u>/etc/pcp.conf</u> contains the local values for these variables.  The
       <b>$PCP_CONF</b> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <b><a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf</a></b>(5).

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
