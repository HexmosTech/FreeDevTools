       <a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/">/proc/sys/kernel/</a> - control a range of kernel parameters

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/">/proc/sys/kernel/</a></u>
              This directory contains files controlling a range of kernel parameters, as described below.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/acct">/proc/sys/kernel/acct</a></u>
              This  file  contains  three  numbers:  <u>highwater</u>,  <u>lowwater</u>,  and <u>frequency</u>.  If BSD-style process
              accounting is enabled, these values control its behavior.  If free space on filesystem  where  the
              log  lives  goes  below <u>lowwater</u> percent, accounting suspends.  If free space gets above <u>highwater</u>
              percent, accounting resumes.  <u>frequency</u> determines how often the kernel checks the amount of  free
              space  (value is in seconds).  Default values are 4, 2, and 30.  That is, suspend accounting if 2%
              or less space is free; resume it if 4% or more space is free; consider information about amount of
              free space valid for 30 seconds.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/auto_msgmni">/proc/sys/kernel/auto_msgmni</a></u> (Linux 2.6.27 to Linux 3.18)
              From Linux 2.6.27 to Linux 3.18, this file was  used  to  control  recomputing  of  the  value  in
              <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/msgmni">/proc/sys/kernel/msgmni</a></u>   upon   the   addition  or  removal  of  memory  or  upon  IPC  namespace
              creation/removal.  Echoing "1" into this file enabled <u>msgmni</u> automatic recomputing (and  triggered
              a  recomputation  of  <u>msgmni</u>  based  on  the  current amount of available memory and number of IPC
              namespaces).  Echoing  "0"  disabled  automatic  recomputing.   (Automatic  recomputing  was  also
              disabled  if  a  value  was explicitly assigned to <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/msgmni">/proc/sys/kernel/msgmni</a></u>.)  The default value in
              <u>auto_msgmni</u> was 1.

              Since Linux 3.19, the content of this file has no effect (because  <u>msgmni</u>  defaults  to  near  the
              maximum value possible), and reads from this file always return the value "0".

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/cap_last_cap">/proc/sys/kernel/cap_last_cap</a></u> (since Linux 3.2)
              See <b><a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</a></b>(7).

       <u>/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound</u> (from Linux 2.2 to Linux 2.6.24)
              This  file  holds  the  value of the kernel <u>capability</u> <u>bounding</u> <u>set</u> (expressed as a signed decimal
              number).  This set is ANDed against the capabilities permitted  to  a  process  during  <b><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></b>(2).
              Starting  with Linux 2.6.25, the system-wide capability bounding set disappeared, and was replaced
              by a per-thread bounding set; see <b><a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</a></b>(7).

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern">/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</a></u>
              See <b><a href="../man5/core.5.html">core</a></b>(5).

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/core_pipe_limit">/proc/sys/kernel/core_pipe_limit</a></u>
              See <b><a href="../man5/core.5.html">core</a></b>(5).

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid">/proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid</a></u>
              See <b><a href="../man5/core.5.html">core</a></b>(5).

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/ctrl-alt-del">/proc/sys/kernel/ctrl-alt-del</a></u>
              This file controls the handling of Ctrl-Alt-Del from the keyboard.  When the value in this file is
              0, Ctrl-Alt-Del is trapped and sent to the <b><a href="../man1/init.1.html">init</a></b>(1) program to handle a graceful restart.  When the
              value is greater than zero, Linux's reaction to a Vulcan Nerve Pinch (tm)  will  be  an  immediate
              reboot,  without  even  syncing  its  dirty  buffers.   Note: when a program (like dosemu) has the
              keyboard in "raw" mode, the Ctrl-Alt-Del is intercepted by the program before it ever reaches  the
              kernel tty layer, and it's up to the program to decide what to do with it.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict">/proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict</a></u> (since Linux 2.6.37)
              The  value  in this file determines who can see kernel syslog contents.  A value of 0 in this file
              imposes no restrictions.  If the value is 1, only privileged users can  read  the  kernel  syslog.
              (See  <b><a href="../man2/syslog.2.html">syslog</a></b>(2)  for more details.)  Since Linux 3.4, only users with the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability
              may change the value in this file.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/domainname">/proc/sys/kernel/domainname</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/hostname">/proc/sys/kernel/hostname</a></u>
              can be used to set the NIS/YP domainname and the hostname of your box in exactly the same  way  as
              the commands <b><a href="../man1/domainname.1.html">domainname</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/hostname.1.html">hostname</a></b>(1), that is:

                  # <b>echo</b> <b>'darkstar'</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/hostname">/proc/sys/kernel/hostname</a></b>
                  # <b>echo</b> <b>'mydomain'</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/domainname">/proc/sys/kernel/domainname</a></b>

              has the same effect as

                  # <b>hostname</b> <b>'darkstar'</b>
                  # <b>domainname</b> <b>'mydomain'</b>

              Note,  however,  that  the classic darkstar.frop.org has the hostname "darkstar" and DNS (Internet
              Domain Name Server) domainname "frop.org", not to be confused with the  NIS  (Network  Information
              Service) or YP (Yellow Pages) domainname.  These two domain names are in general different.  For a
              detailed discussion see the <b><a href="../man1/hostname.1.html">hostname</a></b>(1) man page.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug">/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug</a></u>
              This  file  contains the pathname for the hotplug policy agent.  The default value in this file is
              <u>/sbin/hotplug</u>.

       <u>/proc/sys/kernel/htab-reclaim</u> (before Linux 2.4.9.2)
              (PowerPC only) If this file is set  to  a  nonzero  value,  the  PowerPC  htab  (see  kernel  file
              <u>Documentation/powerpc/ppc_htab.txt</u>) is pruned each time the system hits the idle loop.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/keys/">/proc/sys/kernel/keys/</a></u>
              This  directory  contains  various  files that define parameters and limits for the key-management
              facility.  These files are described in <b><a href="../man7/keyrings.7.html">keyrings</a></b>(7).

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict">/proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict</a></u> (since Linux 2.6.38)
              The value in this file determines whether kernel addresses are exposed via <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u> files  and  other
              interfaces.   A  value  of  0  in  this  file  imposes no restrictions.  If the value is 1, kernel
              pointers printed using the <u>%pK</u> format specifier will be replaced with zeros unless  the  user  has
              the  <b>CAP_SYSLOG</b>  capability.   If  the  value  is  2, kernel pointers printed using the <u>%pK</u> format
              specifier will be replaced with zeros regardless of the user's capabilities.  The initial  default
              value  for  this  file  was 1, but the default was changed to 0 in Linux 2.6.39.  Since Linux 3.4,
              only users with the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability can change the value in this file.

       <u>/proc/sys/kernel/l2cr</u>
              (PowerPC only) This file contains a flag that controls the L2 cache of G3 processor boards.  If 0,
              the cache is disabled.  Enabled if nonzero.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe">/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe</a></u>
              This  file  contains  the  pathname  for  the  kernel  module  loader.   The  default   value   is
              <u><a href="file:/sbin/modprobe">/sbin/modprobe</a></u>.   The  file  is  present  only  if  the  kernel  is  built with the <b>CONFIG_MODULES</b>
              (<b>CONFIG_KMOD</b> in Linux 2.6.26 and earlier) option enabled.  It is described  by  the  Linux  kernel
              source file <u>Documentation/kmod.txt</u> (present only in Linux 2.4 and earlier).

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled">/proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled</a></u> (since Linux 2.6.31)
              A  toggle  value  indicating  if  modules are allowed to be loaded in an otherwise modular kernel.
              This toggle defaults to off (0), but can be set true (1).   Once  true,  modules  can  be  neither
              loaded  nor unloaded, and the toggle cannot be set back to false.  The file is present only if the
              kernel is built with the <b>CONFIG_MODULES</b> option enabled.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/msgmax">/proc/sys/kernel/msgmax</a></u> (since Linux 2.2)
              This file defines a system-wide limit specifying the maximum number of bytes in a  single  message
              written on a System V message queue.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/msgmni">/proc/sys/kernel/msgmni</a></u> (since Linux 2.4)
              This  file  defines  the  system-wide  limit on the number of message queue identifiers.  See also
              <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/auto_msgmni">/proc/sys/kernel/auto_msgmni</a></u>.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/msgmnb">/proc/sys/kernel/msgmnb</a></u> (since Linux 2.2)
              This file  defines  a  system-wide  parameter  used  to  initialize  the  <u>msg_qbytes</u>  setting  for
              subsequently created message queues.  The <u>msg_qbytes</u> setting specifies the maximum number of bytes
              that may be written to the message queue.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/ngroups_max">/proc/sys/kernel/ngroups_max</a></u> (since Linux 2.6.4)
              This  is  a  read-only  file  that  displays  the  upper  limit on the number of a process's group
              memberships.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid">/proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid</a></u> (since Linux 3.3)
              See <b><a href="../man7/pid_namespaces.7.html">pid_namespaces</a></b>(7).

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/ostype">/proc/sys/kernel/ostype</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease">/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease</a></u>
              These files give substrings of <u><a href="file:/proc/version">/proc/version</a></u>.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/overflowgid">/proc/sys/kernel/overflowgid</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/overflowuid">/proc/sys/kernel/overflowuid</a></u>
              These files duplicate the files <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/fs/overflowgid">/proc/sys/fs/overflowgid</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/fs/overflowuid">/proc/sys/fs/overflowuid</a></u>.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/panic">/proc/sys/kernel/panic</a></u>
              This file gives read/write access to the kernel variable <u>panic_timeout</u>.   If  this  is  zero,  the
              kernel will loop on a panic; if nonzero, it indicates that the kernel should autoreboot after this
              number  of  seconds.  When you use the software watchdog device driver, the recommended setting is
              60.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/panic_on_oops">/proc/sys/kernel/panic_on_oops</a></u> (since Linux 2.5.68)
              This file controls the kernel's behavior when an  oops  or  BUG  is  encountered.   If  this  file
              contains 0, then the system tries to continue operation.  If it contains 1, then the system delays
              a  few  seconds  (to  give  klogd  time  to  record  the  oops  output)  and  then panics.  If the
              <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/panic">/proc/sys/kernel/panic</a></u> file is also nonzero, then the machine will be rebooted.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max">/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max</a></u> (since Linux 2.5.34)
              This file specifies the value at which PIDs wrap around (i.e., the  value  in  this  file  is  one
              greater than the maximum PID).  PIDs greater than this value are not allocated; thus, the value in
              this  file  also  acts  as  a system-wide limit on the total number of processes and threads.  The
              default value for this file, 32768, results in the same range of PIDs as on earlier  kernels.   On
              32-bit  platforms,  32768 is the maximum value for <u>pid_max</u>.  On 64-bit systems, <u>pid_max</u> can be set
              to any value up to 2^22 (<b>PID_MAX_LIMIT</b>, approximately 4 million).

       <u>/proc/sys/kernel/powersave-nap</u> (PowerPC only)
              This file contains a flag.  If set, Linux-PPC will use the "nap" mode  of  powersaving,  otherwise
              the "doze" mode will be used.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/printk">/proc/sys/kernel/printk</a></u>
              See <b><a href="../man2/syslog.2.html">syslog</a></b>(2).

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/pty">/proc/sys/kernel/pty</a></u> (since Linux 2.6.4)
              This  directory  contains two files relating to the number of UNIX 98 pseudoterminals (see <b><a href="../man4/pts.4.html">pts</a></b>(4))
              on the system.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/pty/max">/proc/sys/kernel/pty/max</a></u>
              This file defines the maximum number of pseudoterminals.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/pty/nr">/proc/sys/kernel/pty/nr</a></u>
              This read-only file indicates how many pseudoterminals are currently in use.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/random/">/proc/sys/kernel/random/</a></u>
              This directory contains various parameters controlling the operation of the file <u>/dev/random</u>.  See
              <b><a href="../man4/random.4.html">random</a></b>(4) for further information.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid">/proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid</a></u> (since Linux 2.4)
              Each read from this read-only file returns a randomly generated 128-bit UUID, as a string  in  the
              standard UUID format.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space">/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space</a></u> (since Linux 2.6.12)
              Select  the address space layout randomization (ASLR) policy for the system (on architectures that
              support ASLR).  Three values are supported for this file:

              <b>0</b>      Turn ASLR off.  This is the default for architectures that don't support ASLR, and when the
                     kernel is booted with the <u>norandmaps</u> parameter.

              <b>1</b>      Make the addresses of <b><a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a></b>(2) allocations, the stack, and the VDSO page randomized.   Among
                     other things, this means that shared libraries will be loaded at randomized addresses.  The
                     text  segment  of  PIE-linked  binaries  will also be loaded at a randomized address.  This
                     value is the default if the kernel was configured with <b>CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK</b>.

              <b>2</b>      (Since Linux 2.6.25) Also support heap randomization.  This value is  the  default  if  the
                     kernel was not configured with <b>CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK</b>.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev">/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</a></u>
              This  file  is documented in the Linux kernel source file <u>Documentation/admin-guide/initrd.rst</u> (or
              <u>Documentation/initrd.txt</u> before Linux 4.10).

       <u>/proc/sys/kernel/reboot-cmd</u> (Sparc only)
              This file seems to be a way to give an argument to the SPARC ROM/Flash boot loader.  Maybe to tell
              it what to do after rebooting?

       <u>/proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-max</u>
              (Up to and including Linux 2.6.7; see <b><a href="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</a></b>(2)) This file can be  used  to  tune  the  maximum
              number of POSIX real-time (queued) signals that can be outstanding in the system.

       <u>/proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-nr</u>
              (Up  to  and  including  Linux  2.6.7.)   This  file  shows  the number of POSIX real-time signals
              currently queued.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/sched_autogroup_enabled</u> (since Linux 2.6.38)
              See <b><a href="../man7/sched.7.html">sched</a></b>(7).

       <u>/proc/sys/kernel/sched_child_runs_first</u> (since Linux 2.6.23)
              If this file contains the value zero, then, after a <b><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></b>(2), the parent is first scheduled on  the
              CPU.   If  the  file  contains a nonzero value, then the child is scheduled first on the CPU.  (Of
              course, on a multiprocessor system, the parent and the child might both immediately  be  scheduled
              on a CPU.)

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/sched_rr_timeslice_ms">/proc/sys/kernel/sched_rr_timeslice_ms</a></u> (since Linux 3.9)
              See <b><a href="../man2/sched_rr_get_interval.2.html">sched_rr_get_interval</a></b>(2).

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_period_us">/proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_period_us</a></u> (since Linux 2.6.25)
              See <b><a href="../man7/sched.7.html">sched</a></b>(7).

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us">/proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us</a></u> (since Linux 2.6.25)
              See <b><a href="../man7/sched.7.html">sched</a></b>(7).

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/seccomp/">/proc/sys/kernel/seccomp/</a></u> (since Linux 4.14)
              This  directory  provides  additional  seccomp  information and configuration.  See <b><a href="../man2/seccomp.2.html">seccomp</a></b>(2) for
              further details.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/sem">/proc/sys/kernel/sem</a></u> (since Linux 2.4)
              This file contains 4 numbers defining limits for System V IPC semaphores.  These  fields  are,  in
              order:

              SEMMSL The maximum semaphores per semaphore set.

              SEMMNS A system-wide limit on the number of semaphores in all semaphore sets.

              SEMOPM The maximum number of operations that may be specified in a <b><a href="../man2/semop.2.html">semop</a></b>(2) call.

              SEMMNI A system-wide limit on the maximum number of semaphore identifiers.

       <u>/proc/sys/kernel/sg-big-buff</u>
              This  file shows the size of the generic SCSI device (sg) buffer.  You can't tune it just yet, but
              you could change it at compile time  by  editing  <u>include/scsi/sg.h</u>  and  changing  the  value  of
              <b>SG_BIG_BUFF</b>.  However, there shouldn't be any reason to change this value.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/shm_rmid_forced">/proc/sys/kernel/shm_rmid_forced</a></u> (since Linux 3.1)
              If  this  file  is set to 1, all System V shared memory segments will be marked for destruction as
              soon as the number of attached processes falls to zero; in other words, it is no  longer  possible
              to create shared memory segments that exist independently of any attached process.

              The  effect is as though a <b><a href="../man2/shmctl.2.html">shmctl</a></b>(2) <b>IPC_RMID</b> is performed on all existing segments as well as all
              segments created in the future (until this file is reset to 0).  Note that existing segments  that
              are attached to no process will be immediately destroyed when this file is set to 1.  Setting this
              option  will  also destroy segments that were created, but never attached, upon termination of the
              process that created the segment with <b><a href="../man2/shmget.2.html">shmget</a></b>(2).

              Setting this file to 1 provides a way of ensuring that all System V  shared  memory  segments  are
              counted  against  the  resource  usage  and  resource  limits (see the description of <b>RLIMIT_AS</b> in
              <b><a href="../man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit</a></b>(2)) of at least one process.

              Because setting this file to 1 produces behavior that is nonstandard and could also break existing
              applications, the default value in this file is 0.  Set this file to 1 only if  you  have  a  good
              understanding of the semantics of the applications using System V shared memory on your system.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/shmall">/proc/sys/kernel/shmall</a></u> (since Linux 2.2)
              This file contains the system-wide limit on the total number of pages of System V shared memory.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax">/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax</a></u> (since Linux 2.2)
              This  file  can  be  used to query and set the run-time limit on the maximum (System V IPC) shared
              memory segment size that can be created.  Shared memory segments up to 1 GB are now  supported  in
              the kernel.  This value defaults to <b>SHMMAX</b>.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/shmmni">/proc/sys/kernel/shmmni</a></u> (since Linux 2.4)
              This  file specifies the system-wide maximum number of System V shared memory segments that can be
              created.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/sysctl_writes_strict">/proc/sys/kernel/sysctl_writes_strict</a></u> (since Linux 3.16)
              The value in this file determines how the file offset affects the behavior of updating entries  in
              files under <u><a href="file:/proc/sys">/proc/sys</a></u>.  The file has three possible values:

              -1  This  provides legacy handling, with no printk warnings.  Each <b><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></b>(2) must fully contain the
                  value to be written, and multiple writes on the same file descriptor will overwrite the entire
                  value, regardless of the file position.

              0   (default) This provides the same behavior as for -1,  but  printk  warnings  are  written  for
                  processes that perform writes when the file offset is not 0.

              1   Respect  the  file  offset  when  writing  strings into <u><a href="file:/proc/sys">/proc/sys</a></u> files.  Multiple writes will
                  <u>append</u> to the value buffer.  Anything written beyond the maximum length of  the  value  buffer
                  will  be ignored.  Writes to numeric <u><a href="file:/proc/sys">/proc/sys</a></u> entries must always be at file offset 0 and the
                  value must be fully contained in the buffer provided to <b><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></b>(2).

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq">/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq</a></u>
              This file controls the functions allowed to be invoked by the SysRq key.   By  default,  the  file
              contains  1  meaning that every possible SysRq request is allowed (in older kernel versions, SysRq
              was disabled by default, and you were required to specifically enable it at run-time, but this  is
              not the case any more).  Possible values in this file are:

              0    Disable sysrq completely

              1    Enable all functions of sysrq

              &gt; 1  Bit mask of allowed sysrq functions, as follows:
                     2  Enable control of console logging level
                     4  Enable control of keyboard (SAK, unraw)
                     8  Enable debugging dumps of processes etc.
                    16  Enable sync command
                    32  Enable remount read-only
                    64  Enable signaling of processes (term, kill, oom-kill)
                   128  Allow reboot/poweroff
                   256  Allow nicing of all real-time tasks

              This  file  is present only if the <b>CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ</b> kernel configuration option is enabled.  For
              further  details  see  the  Linux  kernel  source  file  <u>Documentation/admin-guide/sysrq.rst</u>   (or
              <u>Documentation/sysrq.txt</u> before Linux 4.10).

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/version">/proc/sys/kernel/version</a></u>
              This file contains a string such as:

                  #5 Wed Feb 25 21:49:24 MET 1998

              The "#5" means that this is the fifth kernel built from this source base and the date following it
              indicates the time the kernel was built.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/threads-max">/proc/sys/kernel/threads-max</a></u> (since Linux 2.3.11)
              This  file specifies the system-wide limit on the number of threads (tasks) that can be created on
              the system.

              Since Linux 4.1, the value that can be written to <u>threads-max</u> is bounded.  The minimum value  that
              can  be  written  is  20.   The  maximum  value  that  can  be  written  is  given by the constant
              <b>FUTEX_TID_MASK</b> (0x3fffffff).  If a value outside of this range  is  written  to  <u>threads-max</u>,  the
              error <b>EINVAL</b> occurs.

              The  value  written  is  checked  against the available RAM pages.  If the thread structures would
              occupy too much (more than 1/8th) of the available RAM pages, <u>threads-max</u> is reduced accordingly.

       <u>/proc/sys/kernel/zero-paged</u> (PowerPC only)
              This file contains a flag.  When enabled (nonzero), Linux-PPC will  pre-zero  pages  in  the  idle
              loop, possibly speeding up get_free_pages.
