       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="SnapToRegion"</b> <b>region="value"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Resize and move active window according to the given region.

           ToggleSnapToRegion  additionally  toggles the active window between tiled to the given region and its
           untiled position.

           See <a href="../man5/labwc-config.5.html">labwc-config</a>(5) for further information on how to define regions.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="UnSnap"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Resize and move the active window back to  its  untiled  or  unmaximized  position  if  it  had  been

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="PreviousWindow"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Cycle focus to next/previous window respectively.
                Default keybind for NextWindow is Alt-Tab.

           The arrow keys are used to move forwards/backwards while cycling.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="Reconfigure"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Re-load configuration and theme files.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="ShowMenu"</b> <b>menu="root-menu"/&gt;</b>

           Show a menu.

           &lt;action name="ShowMenu" menu="MENU"&gt;
             &lt;atCursor&gt;yes|no&lt;/atCursor&gt;
             &lt;position&gt;
               &lt;x&gt;X&lt;/x&gt;
               &lt;y&gt;Y&lt;/y&gt;
             &lt;/position&gt;
           &lt;/action&gt;

           <b>menu</b>  The  name  of the menu to show. The menus "root-menu", "client-menu", "client-send-to-menu" and
           "client-list-combined-menu" are guaranteed to exist, but others may be defined explicitly. See <a href="../man5/labwcmenu.5.html">labwc-</a>
           <a href="../man5/labwcmenu.5.html">menu</a>(5) for more information.

           <b>atCursor</b> [yes|no] When opening a menu, open the menu at the location of the mouse cursor. When set to
           no, the menu will appear at the upper-left corner  of  the  window  associated  with  the  action  or
           underneath the window button that opened the menu. Default is yes.

           <b>position</b> Show the menu in the specified position on the monitor that has cursor focus, see below.

           The  position tag has two sub-tags. &lt;x&gt; and &lt;y&gt; specify a position and take either a pixel value, the
           string "center" which will center the menu in that dimension, or a  relative  value  specified  as  a
           percentage  A  relative  value  is interpreted in terms of the monitor the menu will be shown on, and
           will be relative to the left/top edge of the menu window and monitor for positive values, and to  the
           right/bottom edge for negative values.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="SetDecorations"</b> <b>decorations="value"</b> <b>forceSSD="no"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Set decorations of focused window.

           <b>decorations</b>  [full|border|none] <b>full</b> enables the whole server side decorations. With <b>border</b>. only the
           borders and invisible resize area are enabled. <b>none</b> disables everything.

           <b>forceSSD</b> [yes|no] If this is no, this action will be  ignored  for  windows  that  have  client  side
           decorations if it would increase the amount of decoration. Default is no.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="ToggleDecorations"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Toggle decorations of focused window.

           This is a 3-state action which can be executed multiple times:
           •   Only the titlebar will be hidden, borders and resize area are kept
           •   Remaining decorations will be disabled
           •   Decorations will be shown normally

           By  disabling the theme configuration 'keepBorder' the first step will be removed and the action only
           toggles between on and off.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="ToggleFullscreen"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Toggle fullscreen state of focused window.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="ToggleMaximize"</b> <b>direction="value"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Toggle maximize state of focused window. Supported directions are "both" (default), "horizontal", and
           "vertical".

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="Maximize"</b> <b>direction="value"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Maximize focused window in the direction(s) specified. Supported  directions  are  "both"  (default),
           "horizontal", and "vertical".

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="UnMaximize"</b> <b>direction="value"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Unmaximize  focused  window  in  the  direction(s)  specified  and  return  it  to  its pre-maximized
           dimensions. Supported directions are "both" (default), "horizontal", and "vertical".

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="ToggleAlwaysOnTop"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Toggle always-on-top of focused window.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="ToggleAlwaysOnBottom"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Toggle between layers 'always-on-bottom' and 'normal'. When a window  is  in  the  'always-on-bottom'
           layer,  it  is rendered below all other top-level windows. It is anticipated that this action will be
           useful when defining window-rules for desktop-management tools that do  not  support  the  wlr-layer-
           shell protocol.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="ToggleOmnipresent"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Toggle omnipresent (visible on all workspaces / sticky) for the focused window.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="ToggleKeybinds"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Stop  handling keybinds other than ToggleKeybinds itself. This can be used to allow A-Tab and similar
           keybinds to be delivered to Virtual Machines, VNC clients or nested compositors. A second  call  will
           restore all original keybinds.

           This  action  will only affect the window that had keyboard focus when the binding was executed. Thus
           when switching to another window, all the usual keybinds will function again until switching back  to
           the original window. There can be multiple windows with this mode set.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="ToggleTearing"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Toggles  tearing  for  the focused window between enabled and disabled. This overrides the preference
           (tearing hint) from the focused window.

           Requires  the  config  option  'allowTearing'.  When  'allowTearing'  is  set  to   'fullscreen'   or
           'fullscreenForced', tearing will still only be enabled if the active window is in fullscreen mode.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="FocusOutput"</b> <b>output="HDMI-A-1"</b> <b>direction="value"</b> <b>wrap="no"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Give focus to topmost window on other output and warp the cursor to the center of the window.

           If  <b>output</b>  is  specified,  the  focus  is given to the specified output and <b>direction</b> is ignored. If
           <b>output</b> is omitted, <b>direction</b> may be one of "left", "right", "up" or "down" to indicate that the focus
           should be given to the next output in that direction (if one exists).

           <b>wrap</b> [yes|no] When using the direction attribute, wrap around from  right-to-left  or  top-to-bottom,
           and vice versa. Default is no.

           If the target output does not contain any windows, the cursor will be centered on the output.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="MoveToOutput"</b> <b>output="HDMI-A-1"</b> <b>direction="value"</b> <b>wrap="no"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Moves active window to other output, unless the window state is fullscreen.

           If  <b>output</b>  is  specified,  the window will be sent directly to the specified output and <b>direction</b> is
           ignored. If <b>output</b> is omitted, <b>direction</b> may be one of "left", "right", "up" or  "down"  to  indicate
           that the window should be moved to the next output in that direction (if one exists).

           <b>wrap</b>  [yes|no]  When  using the direction attribute, wrap around from right-to-left or top-to-bottom,
           and vice versa. Default no.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="FitToOutput"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Resizes active window size to width and height of the output when the window size exceeds the  output
           size.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="GoToDesktop"</b> <b>to="value"</b> <b>wrap="yes"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Switch to workspace.

           <b>to</b>  The  workspace  to switch to. Supported values are "current", "last", "left", "right" or the full
           name of a workspace or its index (starting at 1) as configured in rc.xml.

           <b>wrap</b> [yes|no] Wrap around from last desktop to first, and vice versa. Default yes.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="SendToDesktop"</b> <b>to="value"</b> <b>follow="yes"</b> <b>wrap="yes"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Send active window to workspace.

           <b>to</b> The workspace to send the window to. Supported values are the same as for GoToDesktop.

           <b>follow</b> [yes|no] Also switch to the specified workspace. Default yes.

           <b>wrap</b> [yes|no] Wrap around from last desktop to first, and vice versa. Default yes.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="VirtualOutputAdd"</b> <b>output_name="value"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Add virtual output (headless backend).

           For example, it can be used to overlay virtual output on real output, but with a different resolution
           (this can be done with `wlr-randr` or `wdisplays`). After that, virtual output can  be  selected  for
           screen sharing (casting), effectively sharing only the region of the screen.

           It  must  be  noted  that  overlaying  virtual  output  and real output is not endorsed or explicitly
           supported by wlroots. For example, after configuring virtual output, real output must be reconfigured
           as well (for the overlay configuration to work correctly). This is the example configuration:

           &lt;keybind key="W-v"&gt;
             &lt;action name="VirtualOutputAdd" output_name="ScreenCasting"/&gt;
             &lt;action name="Execute" command='sh -c "wlr-randr --output ScreenCasting --pos 0,0 --scale 2 --custom-mode 3840x2110; wlr-randr --output eDP-1 --pos 0,0 --scale 2 --mode 3840x2160"'/&gt;
           &lt;/keybind&gt;
           &lt;keybind key="W-c"&gt;
             &lt;action name="VirtualOutputRemove"/&gt;
           &lt;/keybind&gt;

           Note that the vertical resolution of "ScreenCasting" output is just 50px smaller than "eDP-1"  output
           to cut off bottom panel from screen sharing.

           Virtual  output  is  also  useful  for  extending  the  desktop to (maybe mobile) remote systems like
           tablets. E.g. simply adding a virtual output, attaching wayvnc to it and running a VNC client on  the
           remote system.

           <b>output_name</b>  The  name  of  virtual  output.  Providing virtual output name is beneficial for further
           automation. Default is "HEADLESS-X".

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="VirtualOutputRemove"</b> <b>output_name="value"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Remove virtual output (headless backend).

           <b>output_name</b> The name of virtual output. If not supplied, will remove the last virtual output added.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="AutoPlace"</b> <b>policy="value"/&gt;</b>
           Reposition the window according to the desired placement policy.

           <b>policy</b> [automatic|cursor|center|cascade] Use the specified policy, which has the same meaning as  the
           corresponding value for <b>&lt;placement&gt;&lt;policy&gt;</b>. Default is automatic.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="Shade"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="Unshade"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="ToggleShade"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Set,  unset,  or  toggle,  respectively, the "shaded" state of the active window. When shaded, window
           contents are hidden, leaving only the titlebar visible. Full-screen windows or those without  server-
           side  decorations  (including  those  for  which  the  server-side  titlebar has been hidden) are not
           eligible for shading.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="WarpCursor"</b> <b>to="output"</b> <b>x="center"</b> <b>y="center"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Warp the cursor to a position relative to the active output or window.

           <b>to</b> [output|window] Specifies the target area of  the  warp.  Default  is  "output"  <b>x</b>  [center|value]
           Specifies  the  horizontal  warp  position  within the target area. "center": Moves the cursor to the
           horizontal center of the target area. Positive or negative integers warp the  cursor  to  a  position
           offset by the specified number of pixels from the left or right edge of the target area respectively.
           Default  is  "center"  <b>y</b>  [center|value]  Equivalent for the vertical warp position within the target
           area. Default is "center"

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="EnableTabletMouseEmulation"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="DisableTabletMouseEmulation"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="ToggleTabletMouseEmulation"&gt;</b>
           Enable, disable or toggle mouse emulation for drawing tablets respectively.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="ToggleMagnify"&gt;</b>
           Toggle the screen magnifier on or off at the last magnification level used.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="ZoomIn"&gt;</b>
       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="ZoomOut"&gt;</b>
           Increase or decrease the magnification level for the screen magnifier. If the magnifier is  currently
           off,  ZoomIn will enable it at the lowest magnification, equal to (1 + the magnifier increment set in
           the theme). If the magnifier is on and at the lowest magnification, ZoomOut will turn it off.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="None"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           If used as the only action for a binding: clear an earlier defined binding.

</pre><h4><b>CONDITIONAL</b> <b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Actions that execute other actions. Used in keyboard/mouse bindings.

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="If"&gt;</b>
           This action will execute one set of actions if the focused window matches the criteria, or another if
           it does not.

           The arguments are as follows:

               &lt;action name="If"&gt;
                 &lt;query/&gt;
                 &lt;then&gt;&lt;action/&gt;&lt;/then&gt;
                 &lt;else&gt;&lt;action/&gt;&lt;/else&gt;
               &lt;/action&gt;

           <b>query</b>
               Define a query with zero or more conditions. All conditions must be evaluated as  true  in  order
               for the window to match this query. Multiple queries can be defined.

               Pattern matching is done according to <a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a>(7) and is case-insensitive.

               Conditions are as follows:

               <b>identifier</b>
                   XDG shell app_id for Wayland clients, WM_CLASS for XWayland clients.

               <b>title</b>
                   XDG shell title for Wayland clients, WM_NAME for XWayland clients.

               <b>type</b>
                   Internal heuristics for Wayland clients, NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE for XWayland clients.

               <b>shaded</b> [yes|no]
                   Whether or not the client is rolled up.

               <b>maximized</b> [both|horizontal|vertical|none]

           <b>then</b>

       <b>&lt;action</b> <b>name="ForEach"&gt;</b>
           Identical to "If" action, but applies to all windows, not just the focused one.

           The <b>ForEach</b> action has another optional <b>none</b> branch which gets  executed  when  no  window  has  been
           matched by the query. This allows for example to implement a run-or-raise functionality.
