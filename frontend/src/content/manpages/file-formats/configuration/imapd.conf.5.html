</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       imapd.conf - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       IMAP configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
          <b>/etc/imapd.conf</b>  is the configuration file for the Cyrus IMAP server.  It defines local parameters for
          IMAP.

          Each line of the <b>/etc/imapd.conf</b> file has the form
                 <u>option</u>: <u>value</u>

          where <u>option</u> is the name of the configuration option being  set  and  <u>value</u>  is  the  value  that  the
          configuration option is being set to.

          Although  there  is no limit to the length of a line, a ``\'' (backslash) character may be used as the
          last character on a line to force it to continue  on  the  next  one.   No  additional  whitespace  is
          inserted  before or after the ``\''.  Note that a line that is split using ``\'' character(s) is still
          considered a single line.

          <b>For</b> <b>example</b>
                 <u>option</u>:\
                     <u>value</u>1 <u>value</u>2 \
                        <u>value</u>3

          <b>is</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b>
                 <u>option</u>: <u>value</u>1 <u>value</u>2   <u>value</u>3

          Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.

          For boolean and enumerated options, the values ``yes'', ``on'', ``t'', ``true''  and  ``1''  turn  the
          option on, the values ``no'', ``off'', ``f'', ``false'' and ``0'' turn the option off.

          Duration  options  take  the form of a number followed by a unit, for example <b>32m</b> (32 minutes).  Units
          are <b>d</b> (days), <b>h</b> (hours), <b>m</b> (minutes) and <b>s</b> (seconds).  Multiple units can  be  combined  and  will  be
          summed  together, for example <b>1h30m</b> is equivalent to <b>90m</b>.  If no unit is specified, an option-specific
          backward-compatible default unit is assumed (documented on  an  option-by-option  basis).   These  are
          simple  time units: 1d=24h, 1h=60m, 1m=60s (daylight savings, timezones, leap adjustments, etc are not
          considered).

          Byte size options take the form of a number followed by a unit, for example <b>1KiB</b> (1 kibibyte).   Units
          are  <b>B</b> (bytes), <b>KiB</b> (kibibytes), <b>MiB</b> (mebibytes), and <b>GiB</b> (gibibytes), which may also be spelt <b>KB</b>, <b>MB</b>,
          and <b>GB</b>.  Units are parsed without regard to case.  Note that regardless of spelling, these  units  are
          always  powers  of 2, and never metric.  That is, 1GiB = 1024MiB, 1MiB = 1024KiB, 1KiB = 1024B.  If no
          unit is specified, an option-specific backward-compatible default unit is assumed  (documented  on  an
          option-by-option basis).

</pre><h4><b>FIELD</b> <b>DESCRIPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
          The  sections  below  detail  options  that  can  be placed in the <b>/etc/imapd.conf</b> file, and show each
          option's default value.  Some options have no default value, these are listed with  ``&lt;no  default&gt;''.
          Some options default to the empty string, these are listed with ``&lt;none&gt;''.

          <b>acl_admin_implies_write:</b> 0
              If  enabled, any user with the admin ACL on a mailbox implicitly gets the ability to write to that
              mailbox as well.

          <b>addressbookprefix:</b> #addressbooks
              The  prefix  for  the  addressbook  mailboxes  hierarchies.   The  hierarchy  delimiter  will   be
              automatically  appended.   The  public addressbook hierarchy will be at the toplevel of the shared
              namespace.  A user's personal addressbook hierarchy will be a child of their Inbox.

          <b>admins:</b> &lt;empty string&gt;
              The list of userids with administrative rights.  Separate each userid with a space.   Sites  using
              Kerberos authentication may use separate "admin" instances.

              Note that accounts used by users should not be administrators.  Administrative accounts should not
              receive mail.  That is, if user "jbRo" is a user reading mail, he should not also be in the admins
              line.   Some  problems  may  occur otherwise, most notably the ability of administrators to create
              top-level mailboxes visible to users, but not writable by users.

          <b>afspts_localrealms:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The list of realms which are  to  be  treated  as  local,  and  thus  stripped  during  identifier
              canonicalization  (for the AFSPTS ptloader module).  This is different from loginrealms in that it
              occurs later in the authorization process (as the user id is canonified for PTS lookup).

          <b>afspts_mycell:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Cell to use for AFS PTS lookups.  Defaults to the local cell.

          <b>allowallsubscribe:</b> 0
              Allow subscription to nonexistent mailboxes.  This option is typically used on backend servers  in
              a  Murder so that users can subscribe to mailboxes that don't reside on their "home" server.  This
              option can also be used as a workaround for IMAP clients which don't play well with nonexistent or
              unselectable mailboxes (e.g., Microsoft Outlook).

          <b>allowanonymouslogin:</b> 0
              Permit logins by the user "anonymous" using any password.  Also allows use of the  SASL  ANONYMOUS
              mechanism.

          <b>allowapop:</b> 1
              Allow use of the POP3 APOP authentication command.

              Note  that  this  command  requires  that  SASL  is compiled with APOP support, that the plaintext
              passwords are available in a SASL auxprop backend (e.g., sasldb), and that the system can  provide
              enough entropy (e.g., from /dev/urandom) to create a challenge in the banner.

          <b>allowdeleted:</b> 0
              Allow access to deleted and expunged data via vendor.cmu-* access.

          <b>allownewnews:</b> 0
              Allow use of the NNTP NEWNEWS command.

              Note that this is a very expensive command and should only be enabled when absolutely necessary.

          <b>allowplaintext:</b> 0
              If enabled, allows the use of cleartext passwords on the wire.

              By  default,  the  use of cleartext passwords requires a TLS/SSL encryption layer to be negotiated
              prior to any cleartext authentication mechanisms  being  advertised  or  allowed.   To  require  a
              TLS/SSL  encryption  layer  to  be  negotiated  prior  to ANY authentication, see the <u>tls_required</u>
              option.

          <b>allowsetacl:</b> 1
              Defaults to enabled.  If disabled, disallows the use of the SETACL command at all via IMAP.

          <b>allowstarttls:</b> 0
              If enabled, allows upgrading a plaintext connection to use TLS (a.k.a  opportunistic  TLS)  via  a
              protocol  specific command/mechanism.  IMAP, LMTP, NNTP, and ManageSieve use the STARTTLS command.
              POP3 uses the STLS command.  HTTP uses the Upgrade header field.

          <b>allowusermoves:</b> 0
              Allow moving user accounts (with associated meta-data) via RENAME or XFER.

              Note that measures should be taken to make sure that the user being moved is not  logged  in,  and
              cannot  login  during  the move.  Failure to do so may result in the user's meta-data (seen state,
              subscriptions, etc) being corrupted or out of date.

          <b>altnamespace:</b> 1
              Use the alternate IMAP namespace, where personal folders reside at the same level in the hierarchy
              as INBOX.

              This option ONLY applies where interaction takes place with the client/user.   Currently  this  is
              limited  to  the  IMAP  protocol (imapd) and Sieve scripts (lmtpd).  This option does NOT apply to
              admin tools such as cyradm (admins ONLY), reconstruct,  quota,  etc.,  NOR  does  it  affect  LMTP
              delivery  of  messages directly to mailboxes via plus-addressing.  The default changed in 3.0 from
              off to on.

          <b>altprefix:</b> Alt Folders
              Alternative INBOX spellings that can't be accessed in altnamespace otherwise go under here

          <b>annotation_db:</b> twoskip
              The cyrusdb backend to use for mailbox annotations.

              Allowed values: <u>skiplist</u>, <u>twoskip</u>, <u>zeroskip</u>

          <b>annotation_db_path:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The   absolute   path   to   the   annotations   db   file.    If   not   specified,    will    be
              configdirectory/annotations.db

          <b>anyoneuseracl:</b> 1
              Should  non-admin  users  be  allowed  to set ACLs for the 'anyone' user on their mailboxes?  In a
              large organization this can cause support problems, but it's enabled by default.

          <b>annotation_allow_undefined:</b> 0
              Allow clients to store values for entries which  are  not  defined  either  by  Cyrus  or  in  the
              annotations_definitions file.

          <b>annotation_definitions:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              File containing external (third-party) annotation definitions.

              Each line of the file specifies the properties of an annotation and has the following form:
                 <u>name</u>, <u>scope</u>, <u>attrib-type</u>, <u>proxy-type</u>, <u>attrib-names</u>, <u>acl</u>

              <u>name</u>   is  the  hierarchical  name  as  in  <u>RFC</u>  <u>5257</u> or <u>RFC</u> <u>5464</u> (in the latter case, without the
                     leading <b>/shared</b> or <b>/private</b>).  For example, /vendor/acme/blurdybloop.

              <u>scope</u>  specifies whether the annotation is for the <b>server</b>, a <b>mailbox</b>, or a <b>message</b>.

              <u>attrib-type</u>
                        specifies the attribute data type, which is used only to check the string  value  passed
                        by clients when setting annotations.  The <u>attrib-type</u> is one of:

                     <b>string</b> any value is accepted.

                     <b>content-type</b>
                            this  obsolete  data  type,  which  was  useful for early drafts of the standard, is
                            accepted but silently translated to <b>string</b>.

                     <b>boolean</b>
                            only the strings "true" or "false" are accepted.  Checking is  case-insensitive  but
                            the value is forced to lowercase.

                     <b>int</b>    integers are accepted.

                     <b>uint</b>   non-negative integers are accepted.

              <u>proxy-type</u>
                     specifies   whether   this   attribute  is  for  the  <b>backend</b>  or  <b>proxy</b>  servers  or  both
                     (<b>proxy_and_backend</b>)

              <u>attrib-names</u>
                     is the space-separated list of available attributes for the annotation. Possible  attribute
                     names   are  <b>value.shared</b>,  <b>value.priv</b>,  and  <b>value</b>  (which  permits  both  <b>value.priv</b>  and
                     <b>value.shared</b>).  The attribute names <b>size</b>,  <b>size.shared</b>,  and  <b>size.priv</b>  are  accepted  but
                     ignored;  these  attributes  are  automatically provided by the server if the corresponding
                     <b>value</b> attribute is specified.  Some obsolete attributes, which were defined early drafts of
                     the standard, are accepted and ignored with a warning.

              <u>extra-permissions</u>
                     is the extra ACL permission bits required for setting this annotation, in standard IMAP ACL
                     permission bit string format.  Note that  this  is  in  addition  to  the  permission  bits
                     specified  in  <u>RFC</u>  <u>5257</u>  and <u>RFC</u> <u>5464</u>, so leaving this field empty is harmless.  Note also
                     that there is no way to specify that an annotation can only be set by  an  admin  user;  in
                     particular the <b>a</b> permission bit does not achieve this.

                     Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.

          <b>annotation_callout:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The  pathname  of a callout to be used to automatically add annotations or flags to a message when
              it is appended to a mailbox.  The path can be either an executable (including a script), or a UNIX
              domain socket.

          <b>annotation_callout_disable_append:</b> 0
              Disables annotations on append with xrunannotator.

          <b>annotation_enable_legacy_commands:</b> 0
              Whether to enable the legacy GETANNOTATION/SETANNOTATION commands.  These commands are  deprecated
              and  will be removed in the future, but might be useful in the meantime for supporting old clients
              that do not implement the <u>RFC</u> <u>5464</u> IMAP METADATA extension.

          <b>aps_topic:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Topic for Apple Push Service registration.

          <b>aps_topic_caldav:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Topic for Apple Push Service registration for CalDAV.

          <b>aps_topic_carddav:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Topic for Apple Push Service registration for CardDAV.

          <b>aps_expiry:</b> 1d
              Time after which a CalDAV/CardDAV push subscription will expire.  A client will  have  to  refresh
              the subscription in order to continue to receive push notifications.

          <b>archive_enabled:</b> 0
              Is  archiving enabled for this server.  You also need to have an archivepartition for the mailbox.
              Archiving allows older email to be stored on slower, cheaper disks - even within the same mailbox,
              as distinct from partitions.

          <b>archive_days:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Deprecated in favour of <u>archive_after</u>.

          <b>archive_after:</b> 7d
              The duration after which to move messages to the archive partition if archiving is enabled.

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, days is assumed.

          <b>archive_maxsize:</b> 1024 K
              The size of the largest message that won't be archived immediately.

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, kibibytes is assumed.

          <b>archive_keepflagged:</b> 0
              If set, messages with the \Flagged system flag won't be archived, provided they are  smaller  than
              <b>archive_maxsize</b>.

          <b>archivepartition-name:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The  pathname of the archive partition <u>name</u>, corresponding to spool partition <b>partition-name</b>.  For
              any mailbox residing in a directory on <b>partition-name</b>, the archived messages will be stored  in  a
              corresponding  directory  on  <b>archivepartition-name</b>.  Note that not every <b>partition-name</b> option is
              strictly required to have a corresponding  <b>archivepartition-name</b>  option,  but  that  without  one
              there's no benefit to enabling archiving.

          <b>auditlog:</b> 0
              Should  cyrus output log entries for every action taken on a message file or mailboxes list entry?
              It's noisy so disabled by default, but can be very useful  for  tracking  down  what  happened  if
              things look strange.

          <b>auth_mech:</b> unix
              The authorization mechanism to use.

              Allowed values: <u>unix</u>, <u>pts</u>, <u>krb</u>, <u>krb5</u>

          <b>autocreateinboxfolders:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Deprecated in favor of <u>autocreate_inbox_folders</u>.

          <b>autocreatequota:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Deprecated in favor of <u>autocreate_quota</u>.

          <b>autocreatequotamsg:</b> -1
              Deprecated in favor of <u>autocreate_quota_messages</u>.

          <b>autosievefolders:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Deprecated in favor of <u>autocreate_sieve_folders</u>.

          <b>generate_compiled_sieve_script:</b> 0
              Deprecated in favor of <u>autocreate_sieve_script_compile</u>.

          <b>autocreate_sieve_compiled_script:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Deprecated in favor of <u>autocreate_sieve_script_compiled</u>.

          <b>autosubscribeinboxfolders:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Deprecated in favor of <u>autocreate_subscribe_folders</u>.

          <b>autosubscribesharedfolders:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Deprecated in favor of <u>autocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders</u>.

          <b>autosubscribe_all_sharedfolders:</b> 0
              Deprecated in favor of <u>autocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders_all</u>.

          <b>autocreate_acl:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              If  folders  are  to  be  created  by  <u>autocreate_inbox_folders</u>, this setting can be used to apply
              additional ACLs to the autocreated folders.   The  syntax  is  "autocreate_acl  folder  identifier
              rights", where <u>folder</u> must match one of the <u>autocreate_inbox_folders</u> folders, <u>identifier</u> must be a
              valid   cyrus   identifier,   and   <u>rights</u>   must  be  a  valid  cyrus  rights  string.   Multiple
              identifier|rights pairs can be assigned to a single folder  by  providing  this  setting  multiple
              times.

              For example, "autocreate_acl Plus anyone p" would allow lmtp delivery to a folder named "Plus".

          <b>autocreate_inbox_folders:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              If  a  user  does  not  have  an INBOX already, and the INBOX is to be created, create the list of
              folders in this setting as  well.   <u>autocreate_inbox_folders</u>  is  a  list  of  INBOX's  subfolders
              separated  by  a  "|",  that  are  automatically  created  by  the  server under the following two
              scenarios. Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped, so "Junk | Trash" results in two  folders:
              "Junk"  and "Trash".  See also the <u>xlist-flag</u> option, for setting special-use flags on autocreated
              folders.

              INBOX folders are created under both the following conditions:

              1. The user logins via the IMAP or the POP3 protocol.  <u>autocreate_quota</u> option must have  a  value
                 of zero or greater.

              2. A message arrives for the user through the <u><a href="../man8/lmtpd.8.html">lmtpd</a>(8)</u>.  <u>autocreate_post</u> option must be enabled.

          <b>autocreate_post:</b> 0
              If  enabled,  when  <u><a href="../man8/lmtpd.8.html">lmtpd</a>(8)</u>  receives an incoming mail for an INBOX that does not exist, then the
              INBOX is automatically created by <u><a href="../man8/lmtpd.8.html">lmtpd</a>(8)</u> and delivery of the message continues.

          <b>autocreate_quota:</b> -1
              If set to a value of zero or higher, users have their INBOX  folders  created  upon  a  successful

              did not yet already exist.

              The user's quota is set to the value if it is greater than zero, otherwise the user has  unlimited
              quota.

              Note  that quota has kibibyte granularity.  Values specified here will be truncated to the nearest
              whole kibibyte.

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, kibibytes is assumed.

          <b>autocreate_quota_messages:</b> -1
              If set to a value of zero or higher, users who have their INBOX folders created upon a  successful

              enabled, receive the message quota configured in this option.

              The default of -1 disables assigning message quota.

              For consistency with <u>autocreate_quota</u>, a value of zero is  treated  as  unlimited  message  quota,
              rather than a message quota of zero.

          <b>autocreate_sieve_folders:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              A  "|" separated list of subfolders of INBOX that will be automatically created, if requested by a
              sieve filter, through the "fileinto" action. The default is to create no folders automatically.

              Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from each folder, so a setting of "Junk | Trash"  will
              create two folders: "Junk" and "Trash".

          <b>autocreate_sieve_script:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The  full  path of a file that contains a sieve script. This script automatically becomes a user's
              initial default sieve filter script.

              When this option is not defined, no default sieve filter is created.  The file must be readable by
              the Cyrus daemon.

          <b>autocreate_sieve_script_compile:</b> 0
              If set to yes and no compiled sieve script file exists, the sieve script which is compiled on  the
              fly will be saved in the file name that autocreate_sieve_compiledscript option points to. In order
              a  compiled  script  to  be generated, autocreate_sieve_script and autocreate_sieve_compiledscript
              must have valid values.

          <b>autocreate_sieve_script_compiled:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The full path of  a  file  that  contains  a  compiled  in  bytecode  sieve  script.  This  script
              automatically  becomes  a  user's  initial  default  sieve  filter  script.  If this option is not
              specified, or the filename doesn't exist then the script  defined  by  autocreate_sieve_script  is
              compiled on the fly and installed as the user's default sieve script.

              option of the imapd.conf.

          <b>autocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              A  list  of  shared  folders (bulletin boards), separated by "|", that the users get automatically
              subscribed to, after their INBOX is created. The shared folder must have been created and the user
              must have the required permissions to get subscribed to it. Otherwise, subscribing to  the  shared
              folder fails.

          <b>autocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders_all:</b> 0
              If  set  to yes, the user is automatically subscribed to all shared folders, one has permission to

          <b>backup_compact_minsize:</b> 0
              The minimum size of chunks in each backup.  The compact tool will try to combine  adjacent  chunks
              that are smaller than this.

              Setting this value to zero or negative disables combining of chunks.

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, kibibytes is assumed.

          <b>backup_compact_maxsize:</b> 0
              The  maximum size of chunks in each backup.  The compact tool will try to split chunks larger than
              this into smaller chunks.

              Setting this value to zero or negative disables splitting of chunks.

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, kibibytes is assumed.

          <b>backup_compact_work_threshold:</b> 1
              The number of chunks that must obviously need compaction before the compact  tool  will  go  ahead

              file.   The  original  file  will  be  named with a timestamped suffix.  This is mostly useful for
              debugging.

              Note that with this enabled, compacting a backup will  actually  increase  the  disk  used  by  it
              (because there will now be an extra copy: the original version, and the compacted version).

          <b>boundary_limit:</b> 1000
              messages  are  parsed recursively and a deep enough MIME structure can cause a stack overflow.  Do
              not parse deeper than this many layers of MIME structure.  The default of 1000 is much higher than
              any sane message should have.

          <b>caldav_accept_invalid_rrules:</b> 0
              Accept invalid RRULEs (e.g. FREQ=WEEKLY;BYMONTHDAY=15) rather than rejecting them as errors.

              How  long  after  an occurrence of event or task has concluded that it is considered 'historical'.
              Changes to historical occurrences of events or tasks WILL NOT have invite or reply  messages  sent
              for them.  A negative value means that events and tasks are NEVER considered historical.

              expanding non-terminating recurrence rules.

              Note that increasing this value will require the DAV databases for calendars to  be  reconstructed
              with the <b>dav_reconstruct</b> utility in order to see its effect on serer-side time-based queries.

          <b>caldav_mindatetime:</b> 19011213T204552Z

              Cyrus should not use other services' interfaces.

              If not enabled (the default), no bind will be performed.  Client connections will use an IP chosen

              The hierarchy delimiter will be automatically appended.

          <b>delete_mode:</b> delayed
              The  manner  in which mailboxes are deleted. In the default <u>delayed</u> mode, mailboxes that are being
              deleted are renamed to a special mailbox hierarchy under the <b>deletedprefix</b>, to be removed later by
              <b><a href="../man8/cyr_expire.8.html">cyr_expire</a>(8)</b>.

              In <u>immediate</u> mode, the mailbox is removed from the filesystem immediately.

              Allowed values: <u>immediate</u>, <u>delayed</u>

          <b>delete_unsubscribe:</b> 0
              Whether to also unsubscribe from mailboxes when  they  are  deleted.   Note  that  this  behaviour
              contravenes <u>RFC</u> <u>3501</u> section 6.3.9, but may be useful for avoiding user/client software confusion.
              The default is 'no'.

          <b>deleteright:</b> c
              Deprecated - only used for backwards compatibility with existing installations.  Lists the old <u>RFC</u>
              <u>2086</u>  right  which was used to grant the user the ability to delete a mailbox.  If a user has this
              right, they will automatically be given the new 'x' right.

          <b>disable_user_namespace:</b> 0
              Preclude list command on user namespace.  If set to 'yes', the LIST response  will  never  include
              any other user's mailbox.  Admin users will always see all mailboxes.  The default is 'no'

          <b>disable_shared_namespace:</b> 0
              Preclude  list command on shared namespace.  If set to 'yes', the LIST response will never include
              any non-user mailboxes.  Admin users will always see all mailboxes.  The default is 'no'

          <b>disconnect_on_vanished_mailbox:</b> 0
              If enabled, IMAP/POP3/NNTP clients will be disconnected by the server if  the  currently  selected
              mailbox is (re)moved by another session.  Otherwise, the missing mailbox is treated as empty while
              in use by the client.

          <b>ischedule_dkim_domain:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The domain to be reported as doing iSchedule DKIM signing.

          <b>ischedule_dkim_key_file:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              File containing the private key for iSchedule DKIM signing.

          <b>ischedule_dkim_required:</b> 1
              A DKIM signature is required on received iSchedule requests.

          <b>ischedule_dkim_selector:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Name  of  the  selector  subdividing the domain namespace.  This specifies the actual key used for

          <b>duplicate_db_path:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The absolute path to the duplicate db file.  If not specified, will be configdirectory/deliver.db

          <b>duplicatesuppression:</b> 1
              If  enabled,  lmtpd  will  suppress  delivery of a message to a mailbox if a message with the same
              message-id (or resent-message-id) is recorded as having already been  delivered  to  the  mailbox.
              Records the mailbox and message-id/resent-message-id of all successful deliveries.

          <b>event_content_inclusion_mode:</b> standard
              The  mode  in  which message content may be included with MessageAppend and MessageNew. "standard"
              mode is the default behavior in which message is included up to a size with the  notification.  In
              "message"  mode,  the  message  is  included  and may be truncated to a size. In "header" mode, it
              includes headers truncated to a size. In "body" mode, it includes body truncated  to  a  size.  In

              <u>jmap</u>

          <b>event_notifier:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              <a href="../man8/Notifyd.8.html">Notifyd</a>(8) method to use for "EVENT" notifications which are based on the <u>RFC</u> <u>5423</u>.  If  not  set,
              "EVENT" notifications are disabled.

          <b>expunge_mode:</b> delayed
              The  mode  in  which messages (and their corresponding cache entries) are expunged.  "semidelayed"
              mode is the old behavior in which the message files are purged at the time  of  the  EXPUNGE,  but
              index  and  cache  records  are  retained  to facilitate QRESYNC.  In "delayed" mode, which is the
              default since Cyrus 2.5.0, the message files are also retained, allowing unexpunge to rescue them.
              In "immediate" mode, both the message files and the index records are removed as soon as possible.
              In all cases, nothing will be finally purged until all other processes have closed the mailbox  to
              ensure  they never see data disappear under them.  In "semidelayed" or "delayed" mode, a later run
              of "cyr_expire" will clean out the retained records (and possibly message  files).   This  reduces
              the  amount  of  I/O  that  takes  place  at  the  time  of  EXPUNGE  and should result in greater
              responsiveness for the client, especially when expunging a  large  number  of  messages.   Allowed
              values: <u>immediate</u>, <u>semidelayed</u>, <u>delayed</u>

          <b>failedloginpause:</b> 3s
              Time to pause after a failed login.

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, seconds is assumed.

          <b>flushseenstate:</b> 1
              Deprecated. No longer used.

          <b>foolstupidclients:</b> 0
              If  enabled, only list the personal namespace when a LIST "*" is performed (it changes the request
              to a LIST "INBOX*").

          <b>force_sasl_client_mech:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Force preference of a given SASL mechanism for client side operations (e.g., murder environments).
              This is separate from (and overridden by) the ability to use the &lt;host shortname&gt;_mechs option  to
              set preferred mechanisms for a specific host.

          <b>fulldirhash:</b> 0
              If  enabled, uses an improved directory hashing scheme which hashes on the entire username instead
              of using just the first letter as the hash.  This changes hash algorithm used for quota  and  user
              directories and if <u>hashimapspool</u> is enabled, the entire mail spool.

              Note  that  this  option CANNOT be changed on a live system.  The server must be quiesced and then
              the directories moved with the <b>rehash</b> utility.

          <b>hashimapspool:</b> 0
              If enabled, the partitions will also be hashed, in addition to the hashing done  on  configuration
              directories.  This is recommended if one partition has a very bushy mailbox tree.

          <b>hostname_mechs:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Force  a  particular  list of SASL mechanisms to be used when authenticating to the backend server
              hostname (where hostname is the short hostname of the server in question). If it is not  specified
              it will query the server for available mechanisms and pick one to use. - Cyrus Murder

          <b>hostname_password:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The password to use for authentication to the backend server hostname (where hostname is the short
              hostname of the server) - Cyrus Murder

          <b>httpallowcompress:</b> 1
              If  enabled, the server will compress response payloads if the client indicates that it can accept
              them.  Note that the compressed data will appear in telemetry  logs,  leaving  only  the  response
              headers as human-readable.

          <b>httpallowcors:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              A  wildmat  pattern  specifying  a list of origin URIs ( scheme "://" host [ ":" port ] ) that are
              allowed to make Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests on the  server.   By  default,  CORS
              requests are disabled.

              Note  that  the  scheme and host should both be lowercase, the port should be omitted if using the
              default for the scheme (80 for http, 443 for https), and there should be no trailing '/' (e.g.: "‐
              <u><a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a>:8080</u>", "<u>https://example.org</u>").

          <b>httpallowtrace:</b> 0
              Allow use of the TRACE method.

              Note that sensitive data might be disclosed by the response.

          <b>httpallowedurls:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Space-separated list of relative URLs (paths) rooted at "httpdocroot" (see below) to be served  by
              httpd.   If  set,  this  option  will  limit  served  static content to only those paths specified
              (returning "404 Not Found" to any other client requested URLs).  Otherwise, httpd will  serve  any
              content found in "httpdocroot".

              Note that any path specified by "rss_feedlist_template" is an exception to this rule.

          <b>httpcontentmd5:</b> 0
              If  enabled,  HTTP  responses  will  include  a Content-MD5 header for the purpose of providing an
              end-to-end message integrity check (MIC) of the payload body.  Note that enabling this option will
              use additional CPU to generate the MD5 digest, which may be ignored by clients anyways.

          <b>httpdocroot:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              If set, http will serve  the  static  content  (html/text/jpeg/gif  files,  etc)  rooted  at  this
              directory.  Otherwise, httpd will not serve any static content.

          <b>httpkeepalive:</b> 20s
              Set  the length of the HTTP server's keepalive heartbeat.  The default is 20 seconds.  The minimum
              value is 0, which will disable the keepalive heartbeat.  When enabled, if a request  takes  longer
              than  <u>httpkeepalive</u>  to  process,  the  server  will  send  the client provisional responses every
              <u>httpkeepalive</u> until the final response can be sent.

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, seconds is assumed.

          <b>httplogheaders:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Space-separated list of HTTP header fields that  will  be  included  in  the  requests  logged  by
              <a href="../man8/httpd.8.html">httpd</a>(8).

          <b>httpmodules:</b> &lt;empty string&gt;
              Space-separated  list of HTTP modules that will be enabled in <a href="../man8/httpd.8.html">httpd</a>(8).  This option has no effect
              on modules that are disabled at compile time due to missing dependencies (e.g. libical).

              Note that "domainkey"  depends  on  "ischedule"  being  enabled,  and  that  both  "freebusy"  and
              "ischedule"  depend  on  "caldav"  being  enabled.   Allowed  values: <u>admin</u>, <u>caldav</u>, <u>carddav</u>, <u>cgi</u>,
              <u>domainkey</u>, <u>freebusy</u>, <u>ischedule</u>, <u>jmap</u>, <u>prometheus</u>, <u>rss</u>, <u>tzdist</u>, <u>webdav</u>

          <b>httpprettytelemetry:</b> 0
              If enabled, HTTP response payloads including server-generated markup languages  (HTML,  XML)  will
              utilize  line  breaks and indentation to promote better human-readability in telemetry logs.  Note
              that enabling this option will increase the amount of data sent across the wire.

          <b>httppts_uri:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The URL endpoint to use when for querying group membership, in URI Template (level 1) format  [<u>RFC</u>
              <u>6570</u>].  The URL MUST contain a variable called "groupId"

          <b>httptimeout:</b> 5m
              Set  the  length of the HTTP server's inactivity autologout timer.  The default is 5 minutes.  The
              minimum value is 0, which will disable persistent connections.

              For backwards compatibility, if no unit is specified, minutes is assumed.

          <b>http_h2_altsvc:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              If set, HTTP/2 (over TLS) will be advertised as being available on the specified [host]:port.

          <b>http_jwt_key_dir:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The absolute path to a directory containing one or more key files to authenticate JSON Web  Tokens
              (<u>RFC</u>  <u>7519</u>)  for  HTTP connections.  Keys for the following JWS algorithms are supported: "HS256",
              "HS384", "HS512", "RS256", "RS384", "RS512".

              A key file consists of one or more keys encoded in PEM format.  RSA keys must be embedded  between
              the  lines  "-----BEGIN  PUBLIC  KEY-----" and "-----END PUBLIC KEY-----" HMAC digest keys must be
              embedded between the lines "-----BEGIN HMAC KEY-----" and "-----END  HMAC  KEY-----",  encoded  in
              base64.   Any  lines  before  or  after  a PEM key definition are ignored, empty lines are ignored
              anywhere in the file.

              The JSON Web Token must be the value of  the  HTTP  "Authorization"  header,  using  the  "Bearer"
              authentication  scheme.  The  JWS Header must include the "alg" and "typ" parameter. A header with
              any other parameter is rejected.  The JWS Payload must include the "sub" claim with the Cyrus user
              identifier as value. It may include the "iat" claim (see <u>http_jwt_max_age</u>).  A  payload  with  any
              other claim is rejected.

          <b>http_jwt_max_age:</b> 0s
              Defines the timespan in which a JSON Web Token is valid (see <u>http_jwt_key</u>). The value must be zero
              or positive.

              If  non-zero,  the  timespan  starts  at the point in time specified in the "iat" claim of the JWS
              Payload and ends after the duration of this option value  has  passed.  Tokens  without  an  "iat"
              claim,  or  with  an  issue  date  in the future, are rejected. There is no leeway for clock skew.
              Starting from Cyrus version 3.8, the "iat" claim only is validated if no "exp" claim is present.

              The zero value disables validation of the "iat" JWS claim.

              Starting from Cyrus 3.8, the "nbf" and "exp" claims always are validated.

          <b>icalendar_max_size:</b> 0
              Maximum allowed iCalendar size. CalDAV and JMAP will reject storage of resources  whose  iCalendar
              representation is larger than this.

              If set to 0 (the default), a large internally-defined limit will be applied.

              If no unit is specified, bytes is assumed.

          <b>idlesocket:</b> {configdirectory}/socket/idle
              Unix domain socket that idled listens on.

          <b>ignorereference:</b> 0
              For backwards compatibility with Cyrus 1.5.10 and earlier -- ignore the reference argument in LIST
              or LSUB commands.

          <b>imapidlepoll:</b> 60s
              The  interval  for  polling  for  mailbox changes and ALERTs while running the IDLE command.  This
              option is used when idled is not enabled or cannot be contacted.  The minimum value is  1  second.
              A value of 0 will disable IDLE.

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, seconds is assumed.

          <b>imapidresponse:</b> 1
              If  enabled,  the  server  responds  to  an  ID command with a parameter list containing: version,
              vendor, support-url, os,  os-version,  command,  arguments,  environment.   Otherwise  the  server
              returns NIL.

          <b>imapmagicplus:</b> 0
              Only  list  a  restricted  set  of  mailboxes  via  IMAP  by  using userid+namespace syntax as the
              authentication/authorization  id.   Using  userid+  (with  an  empty  namespace)  will  list  only
              subscribed mailboxes.

          <b>implicit_owner_rights:</b> lkxan
              The implicit Access Control List (ACL) for the owner of a mailbox.

          <b>@include:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Directive which includes the specified file as part of the configuration.  If the path to the file
              is not absolute, CYRUS_PATH is prepended.

          <b>improved_mboxlist_sort:</b> 0
              If enabled, a special comparator will be used which will correctly sort mailbox names that contain
              characters such as ' ' and '-'.

              Note that this option SHOULD NOT be changed on a live system.  The mailboxes  database  should  be
              dumped  (ctl_mboxlist) before the option is changed, removed, and then undumped after changing the
              option.  When not using flat files for the  subscriptions  databases  the  same  has  to  be  done
              (cyr_dbtool) for each subscription database See improved_mboxlist_sort.html.

          <b>jmap_emailsearch_db_path:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The  absolute  path  to  the JMAP email search cache file.  If not specified, JMAP Email/query and
              Email/queryChanges will not cache email search results.

          <b>jmap_querycache_max_age:</b> 0m
              The duration after which unused cached JMAP query results must be evicted from process memory.  If
              non-zero,  then  the  full  result  of  the  last  query  (before  windowing) is stored in-memory.
              Subsequent queries with the same expression and query state  can  then  page  through  the  cached

              two entries, where the first entry denotes the width and the second entry the height of the image.
              Any additional values are ignored.

              For  example, if message part 1.2 contains an image of width 300 and height 200, then the value of
              this annotation would be:

              For  example, if message part 1.2 contains HTML and references an inlined image at "<u>cid:foo</u>", then
              the value of this annotation would be:

              { "&lt;foo&gt;" : "1.2" }

              ldap_version will be automatically set to 3.

          <b>literalminus:</b> 0
              if  enabled,  CAPABILITIES  will  reply  with  LITERAL-  rather than LITERAL+ (<u>RFC</u> <u>7888</u>).  Doesn't
              actually size-restrict uploads though.

          <b>lmtp_downcase_rcpt:</b> 1
              If enabled, lmtpd will convert the recipient addresses to lowercase (up to  a  '+'  character,  if
              present).

          <b>lmtp_exclude_specialuse:</b> \Snoozed
              Don't allow delivery to folders with given special-use attributes.

              Note  that  "snoozing"  of  emails  can  currently only be done via the JMAP protocol, so delivery
              directly to the Snoozed mailbox is prohibited by default as it will not be moved back  into  INBOX
              automatically.

          <b>lmtp_fuzzy_mailbox_match:</b> 0
              If  enabled,  and  the mailbox specified in the detail part of the recipient (everything after the
              '+') does not exist, lmtpd will try to find the closest match (ignoring case, ignoring whitespace,
              falling back to parent) to the specified mailbox name.

          <b>lmtp_over_quota_perm_failure:</b> 0
              If enabled, lmtpd returns a permanent failure code when  a  user's  mailbox  is  over  quota.   By
              default, the failure is temporary, causing the MTA to queue the message and retry later.

          <b>lmtp_preparse:</b> 0
              If  enabled,  lmtpd will map in the email and parse the xapian data for jmapsearch.  The advantage
              is that the parsing is done without holding any locks.  The disadvantage is that  the  parsing  is
              done even if it winds up not being needed.

          <b>lmtp_strict_quota:</b> 0
              If  enabled,  lmtpd returns a failure code when the incoming message will cause the user's mailbox
              to exceed its quota.  By default, the failure won't occur until the mailbox is already over quota.

          <b>lmtp_strict_rfc2821:</b> 1
              By default, lmtpd will be strict (per <u>RFC</u> <u>2821</u>) with  regards  to  which  envelope  addresses  are
              allowed.   If this option is set to false, 8bit characters in the local-part of envelope addresses
              are changed to 'X' instead.  This is useful to avoid generating backscatter with certain MTAs like
              Postfix or Exim which accept such messages.

          <b>lmtpsocket:</b> {configdirectory}/socket/lmtp
              Unix domain socket that lmtpd listens on, used by <a href="../man8/deliver.8.html">deliver</a>(8). This should match the path specified
              in <a href="../man5/cyrus.conf.5.html">cyrus.conf</a>(5).

          <b>lmtptxn_timeout:</b> 5m
              Timeout used during a lmtp transaction to a remote backend (e.g. in a murder environment).  Can be
              used to prevent hung lmtpds on proxy hosts when a backend server  becomes  unresponsive  during  a
              lmtp transaction.  The default is 5 minutes - change to zero for infinite.

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, seconds is assumed.

          <b>lock_debugtime:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              A  floating  point  number of seconds.  If set, time how long we wait for any lock, and syslog the
              filename and time if it's longer than this value.  The default of NULL means not to time locks.

          <b>loginrealms:</b> &lt;empty string&gt;
              The  list  of  remote  realms  whose  users  may  authenticate  using  cross-realm  authentication

              identity returned by SASL with an "@" in it.).

          <b>loginuseacl:</b> 0
              If enabled, any authentication identity which has <b>a</b> rights on a user's INBOX may log  in  as  that
              user.

          <b>logtimestamps:</b> 0
              Include  notations  in the protocol telemetry logs indicating the number of seconds since the last
              command or response.

          <b>mailbox_default_options:</b> 0
              Default "options" field for the mailbox on create.  You'll want to know what you're  doing  before
              setting this, but it can apply some default annotations like duplicate suppression.

          <b>mailbox_initial_flags:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              space-separated  list of permanent flags which will be pre-set in every newly created mailbox.  If
              you know you will require particular flag names then this avoids a possible race condition against
              a client that fills the entire 128 available slots.  Default is NULL, which is no flags.  Example:
              $Label1 $Label2 $Label3 NotSpam Spam

          <b>mailbox_legacy_dirs:</b> 0
              If enabled, new mailboxes without parents will be created with legacy  paths.   sub  mailboxes  of
              users will still inherit the parent legacy setting.

          <b>mailbox_maxmessages_addressbook:</b> 0
              Limit the number of messages that may exist in a single mailbox of "addressbook" type. Default (0)
              means no limit.  This limit applies after quotas are checked, so if you have both quota limits and
              this set, then you will be denied if you are either over quota or over this per-mailbox count.

          <b>mailbox_maxmessages_calendar:</b> 0
              Limit  the  number  of messages that may exist in a single mailbox of "calendar" type. Default (0)
              means no limit.  This limit applies after quotas are checked, so if you have both quota limits and
              this set, then you will be denied if you are either over quota or over this per-mailbox count.

          <b>mailbox_maxmessages_email:</b> 0
              Limit the number of messages that may exist in a single mailbox of "email" (normal) type.  Default
              (0) means no limit.  This limit applies after quotas are checked, so if you have both quota limits
              and this set, then you will be denied if you are either over quota or over this per-mailbox count.

          <b>mailnotifier:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              <a href="../man8/Notifyd.8.html">Notifyd</a>(8) method to use for "MAIL" notifications.  If not set, "MAIL" notifications are disabled.

          <b>master_bind_errors_fatal:</b> 0
              If  enabled,  failure to bind a port during startup is treated as a fatal error, causing master to
              shut down immediately.  The default is to keep running, with the affected service  disabled  until
              the next SIGHUP causes it to retry.

              Note  that  this  only applies during startup.  New services that fail to come up in response to a
              reconfig+SIGHUP will just be logged and disabled  like  the  default  behaviour,  without  causing
              master to exit.

          <b>master_pid_file:</b> {configdirectory}/master.pid
              The path to a file that <a href="../man8/master.8.html">master</a>(8) will write its PID to when running as a daemon.

          <b>master_ready_file:</b> {configdirectory}/master.ready
              The  path  to  a  file  that  <a href="../man8/master.8.html">master</a>(8)  will update to indicate that it is ready to accept client
              connections.  This file will be created if it does not already exist, or truncated if it does.

          <b>maxheaderlines:</b> 1000
              Maximum number of lines of header that will be processed into cache records.   Default  1000.   If
              set  to  zero, it is unlimited.  If a message hits the limit, an error will be logged and the rest
              of the lines in the header will be skipped.  This is to avoid  malformed  messages  causing  giant
              cache records.

          <b>maxlogins_per_host:</b> 0
              Maximum number of logged in sessions allowed per host, zero means no limit.

          <b>maxlogins_per_user:</b> 0
              Maximum number of logged in sessions allowed per user, zero means no limit.

          <b>maxargssize:</b> 0
              Maximum  total size of arguments to an IMAP command that will be accepted by Cyrus.  Commands with
              arguments that exceed this limit will be rejected.

              If set to 0 (the default), a large internally-defined limit will be applied.

              If no unit is specified, bytes is assumed.

          <b>maxmessagesize:</b> 0
              Maximum size of messages that will be accepted by  Cyrus.   This  affects  LMTP  deliveries,  IMAP
              appends, DAV uploads, etc.  Messages larger than this will be rejected.

              If set to 0 (the default), a large internally-defined limit will be applied.

              If no unit is specified, bytes is assumed.

          <b>maxliteral:</b> 128K
              Maximum size of a single literal allowed by the IMAP parser.

              If set to 0, a large internally-defined limit will be applied.

              If no unit is specified, bytes is assumed.

              Literals used for message [part] data in APPEND are only limited by the 'maxmessagesize' option.

              If  the  'literalminus' option is enabled, non-synchonizing literals will be limited to the lesser
              of 4K and either 'maxliteral' or 'maxmessagesize', depending on the use-case.

          <b>maxquoted:</b> 128K
              Maximum size of a single quoted string allowed by the IMAP parser.

              If set to 0, a large internally-defined limit will be applied.

              If no unit is specified, bytes is assumed.

          <b>maxword:</b> 128K
              Maximum size of a single word allowed by the IMAP parser.

              If set to 0, a large internally-defined limit will be applied.

              If no unit is specified, bytes is assumed.

          <b>mboxkey_db:</b> twoskip
              The cyrusdb backend to use for mailbox keys.

              Allowed values: <u>skiplist</u>, <u>twoskip</u>, <u>zeroskip</u>

              <u>annotations</u>, <u>lock</u>, <u>dav</u>, <u>archivecache</u>

          <b>metapartition-name:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The pathname of the metadata partition <u>name</u>, corresponding to spool partition <b>partition-name</b>.  For
              any  mailbox  residing  in  a  directory  on  <b>partition-name</b>,  the  metadata   files   listed   in
              <u>metapartition_files</u> will be stored in a corresponding directory on <b>metapartition-name</b>.   Note that
              not  every <b>partition-name</b> option is required to have a corresponding <b>metapartition-name</b> option, so
              that you can selectively choose which spool partitions will have separate metadata partitions.

          <b>mupdate_authname:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The SASL username (Authentication Name) to use when  authenticating  to  the  mupdate  server  (if
              needed).

          <b>mupdate_config:</b> standard
              The  configuration  of  the  mupdate servers in the Cyrus Murder.  The "standard" config is one in
              which there are discreet frontend (proxy) and backend servers.  The "unified"  config  is  one  in
              which  a  server  can  be  both  a  frontend and backend.  The "replicated" config is one in which
              multiple backend servers all share the same mailspool, but each have their own  "replicated"  copy
              of mailboxes.db.  Allowed values: <u>standard</u>, <u>unified</u>, <u>replicated</u>

          <b>munge8bit:</b> 1
              If  enabled, lmtpd munges messages with 8-bit characters in the headers.  The 8-bit characters are
              changed to `X'.  If <b>reject8bit</b> is enabled, setting <b>munge8bit</b> has no effect.  (A proper solution to
              non-ASCII characters in headers is offered by <u>RFC</u> <u>2047</u> and its predecessors.)

          <b>mupdate_connections_max:</b> 128
              The max number of connections that a mupdate process will allow, this is related to the number  of
              file  descriptors  in  the  mupdate  process.   Beyond this number connections will be immediately
              issued a BYE response.

          <b>mupdate_password:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The SASL password (if needed) to use when authenticating to the mupdate server.

          <b>mupdate_workers_max:</b> 50
              The maximum number of mupdate worker threads (overall).

          <b>mupdate_workers_maxspare:</b> 10

          <b>mupdate_workers_minspare:</b> 2
              The minimum number of idle mupdate worker threads.

          <b>mupdate_workers_start:</b> 5
              The number of mupdate worker threads to start.

          <b>netscapeurl:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              If enabled at compile time, this specifies a URL to reply when Netscape asks the server where  the
              mail administration HTTP server is.  Administrators should set this to a local resource.

          <b>newsaddheaders:</b> to
              Space-separated  list  of headers to be added to incoming usenet articles.  Added <u>To:</u> headers will
              contain email delivery addresses corresponding to each newsgroup in the <u>Newsgroups:</u> header.  Added
              <u>Reply-To:</u> headers will contain email delivery addresses corresponding to  each  newsgroup  in  the
              <u>Followup-To:</u>  or  <u>Newsgroups:</u> header.  If the specified header(s) already exist in an article, the
              email delivery addresses will be appended to the original header body(s).

              This option applies if and only if the <b>newspostuser</b> option is set.  Allowed values: <u>to</u>, <u>replyto</u>

          <b>newsgroups:</b> *
              A wildmat pattern specifying which mailbox hierarchies should  be  treated  as  newsgroups.   Only
              mailboxes  matching the wildmat will accept and/or serve articles via NNTP.  If not set, a default
              wildmat of "*" (ALL shared mailboxes) will be used.  If the <u>newsprefix</u> option  is  also  set,  the
              default wildmat will be translated to "&lt;newsprefix&gt;.*"

          <b>newsmaster:</b> news
              Userid  that  is  used  for  checking access controls when executing Usenet control messages.  For
              instance, to allow articles to be automatically deleted by cancel messages, give the  "news"  user
              the  'd' right on the desired mailboxes.  To allow newsgroups to be automatically created, deleted
              and renamed by the corresponding control messages, give the "news"  user  the  'c'  right  on  the
              desired mailbox hierarchies.

          <b>newspeer:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              A  list  of whitespace-separated news server specifications to which articles should be fed.  Each
              server specification is a string of the form [user[:pass]@]host[:port][/wildmat] where  'host'  is
              the  fully  qualified hostname of the server, 'port' is the port on which the server is listening,
              'user' and 'pass' are the authentication credentials and 'wildmat' is  a  pattern  that  specifies
              which  groups  should  be  fed.   If no 'port' is specified, port 119 is used.  If no 'wildmat' is
              specified, all groups are fed.  If 'user' is specified (even if empty), then the NNTP POST command
              will be used to feed the article to the server, otherwise the IHAVE command will be used.

              A '@' may be used in place of '!' in the wildmat to prevent feeding articles cross-posted  to  the
              given  group,  otherwise  cross-posted  articles  are fed if any part of the wildmat matches.  For
              example, the string "peer.example.com:*,!control.*,@local.*" would feed all groups except  control
              messages  and  local  groups  to  peer.example.com.  In the case of cross-posting to local groups,
              these articles would not be fed.

          <b>newspostuser:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Userid used to deliver usenet articles to newsgroup folders (usually via lmtp2nntp).  For example,
              if set to "post", email sent to "post+comp.mail.imap" would be delivered to  the  "comp.mail.imap"
              folder.

              When  set,  the Cyrus NNTP server will add the header(s) specified in the <b>newsaddheaders</b> option to
              each incoming  usenet  article.   The  added  header(s)  will  contain  email  delivery  addresses
              corresponding to each relevant newsgroup.  If not set, no headers are added to usenet articles.

          <b>newsprefix:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Prefix to be prepended to newsgroup names to make the corresponding IMAP mailbox names.

          <b>newsrc_db_path:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The absolute path to the newsrc db file.  If not specified, will be configdirectory/fetchnews.db

          <b>nntptimeout:</b> 3m
              Set  the length of the NNTP server's inactivity autologout timer.  The minimum value is 3 minutes,
              also the default.

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, minutes is assumed.

          <b>notesmailbox:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The top level mailbox in each user's account which is used to store * Apple-style Notes.   Default
              is blank (disabled).

          <b>notifysocket:</b> {configdirectory}/socket/notify
              Unix domain socket that the mail notification daemon listens on.

          <b>notify_external:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Path to the external program that <a href="../man8/notifyd.8.html">notifyd</a>(8) will call to send mail notifications.

              The external program will be called with the following command line options:

                 <b>-c</b> <b>class</b>

                 <b>-p</b> <b>priority</b>

                 <b>-u</b> <b>user</b>

                 <b>-m</b> <b>mailbox</b>

                 And the notification message will be available on <u>stdin</u>.

          <b>partition-name:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The  pathname  of  the partition <u>name</u>.  At least one partition pathname MUST be specified.  If the
              <b>defaultpartition</b> option is used, then its pathname MUST be specified.  For example, if  the  value
              of the <b>defaultpartion</b> option is <b>part1</b>, then the <b>partition-part1</b> field is required.

          <b>partition_select_mode:</b> freespace-most
              Partition selection mode.

              <u>random</u> (pseudo-)random selection

              <u>freespace-most</u>
                     partition with the most free space (KiB)

              <u>freespace-percent-most</u>
                     partition with the most free space (%)

              <u>freespace-percent-weighted</u>
                     each  partition  is  weighted  according  to  its  free  space (%); the more free space the
                     partition has, the more chances it has to be selected

              <u>freespace-percent-weighted-delta</u>
                     each partition is weighted according to its difference of free space (%)  compared  to  the
                     most  used partition; the more the partition is lagging behind the most used partition, the
                     more chances it has to be selected

                     Note that actually even the most used partition has a few chances to be selected, and those
                     chances increase when other partitions get closer

                     Allowed values: <u>random</u>, <u>freespace-most</u>, <u>freespace-percent-most</u>, <u>freespace-percent-weighted</u>,
                     <u>freespace-percent-weighted-delta</u>

          <b>partition_select_exclude:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              List of partitions to exclude from selection mode.

          <b>partition_select_usage_reinit:</b> 0
              For a given session, number of <b>operations</b> (e.g. partition selection) for  which  partitions  usage
              data are cached.

          <b>partition_select_soft_usage_limit:</b> 0
              Limit of partition usage (%): if a partition is over that limit, it is automatically excluded from
              selection mode.

              If all partitions are over that limit, this feature is not used anymore.

          <b>plaintextloginpause:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Time to pause after a successful plaintext login.  For systems that support strong authentication,
              this permits users to perceive a cost of using plaintext passwords.  (This does not affect the use
              of PLAIN in SASL authentications.)

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, seconds is assumed.

          <b>plaintextloginalert:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Message to send to client after a successful plaintext login.

          <b>popexpiretime:</b> -1
              The  duration advertised as being the minimum a message may be left on the POP server before it is
              deleted (via the CAPA command, defined in the POP3 Extension Mechanism,  which  some  clients  may
              support).   This  duration  has  a granularity of whole days, with partial days truncated (so e.g.
              "45m" is effectively "0d").  "NEVER", the default, may be specified with a negative number.

              The Cyrus POP3 server never deletes mail, no matter what the value of this parameter is.  However,
              if a site implements a less liberal policy, it needs to change this parameter accordingly.

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, days is assumed.

          <b>popminpoll:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Set the minimum amount of time the server forces users to wait between successive POP logins.

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, minutes is assumed.

          <b>popsubfolders:</b> 0
              Allow  access  to  subfolders  of  INBOX  via  POP3  by  using  userid+subfolder  syntax  as   the
              authentication/authorization id.

          <b>poppollpadding:</b> 1
              Create  a  softer  minimum poll restriction.  Allows <u>poppollpadding</u> connections before the minpoll
              restriction is triggered.  Additionally, one padding entry is recovered every <u>popminpoll</u>  minutes.
              This  allows  for  the  occasional  polling  rate  faster than popminpoll, (i.e., for clients that
              require a send/receive to send mail)  but  still  enforces  the  rate  long-term.   Default  is  1
              (disabled).

              The  easiest  way  to  think  of it is a queue of past connections, with one slot being filled for
              every connection, and one slot being cleared every <u>popminpoll</u> minutes. When the queue is full, the
              user will not be able to check mail again until a slot is cleared.  If the user waits a sufficient

          <b>popuseacl:</b> 0
              Enforce  IMAP  ACLs  in  the  pop server.  Due to the nature of the POP3 protocol, the only rights
              which are used by the pop server are 'r', 't', and 's' for the owner  of  the  mailbox.   The  'r'
              right  allows  the  user to open the mailbox and list/retrieve messages.  The 't' right allows the
              user to delete messages.  The 's' right allows messages retrieved by the user to  have  the  \Seen
              flag set (only if <u>popuseimapflags</u> is also enabled).

          <b>popuseimapflags:</b> 0
              If  enabled,  the  pop server will set and obey IMAP flags.  Messages having the \Deleted flag are
              ignored as if they do not exist.  Messages that are retrieved by the client will  have  the  \Seen
              flag set.  All messages will have the \Recent flag unset.

          <b>postuser:</b> &lt;empty string&gt;
              Userid  used  to  deliver  messages to shared folders.  For example, if set to "bb", email sent to
              "bb+shared.blah" would be delivered to the "shared.blah" folder.  By default, an email address  of
              "+shared.blah" would be used.

              Set  to  true  to  allow  proxyd  to issue referrals to clients that support it when answering the
              STATUS command.  This is disabled by default since some clients issue many STATUS  commands  in  a
              row, and do not cache the connections that these referrals would cause, thus resulting in a higher
              authentication load on the respective backend server.

          <b>proxyd_disable_mailbox_referrals:</b> 0
              Set to true to disable the use of mailbox-referrals on the proxy servers.

          <b>sasl_minimum_layer:</b> 0
              The minimum SSF that the server will allow a client to negotiate.  A value of 1 requires integrity
              protection; any higher value requires some amount of encryption.

          <b>sasl_option:</b> 0

          <b>search_attachment_extractor_url:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              A  HTTP  or  HTTPS  URL  to  extract search text from rich text attachments and other media during
              search indexing. The server at this URL must implement the following protocol:

              1.  For  each   attachment   of   an   email,   Cyrus   sends   a   GET   request   to   the   URL
              &lt;extractor-url&gt;/&lt;cyrus-id&gt;,  where  &lt;extractor-url&gt;  is  the  configured  URL  and &lt;cyrus-id&gt; is a
              Cyrus-chosen path segment that uniquely identifies this attachment.

              2. If the extractor already has a cached plain  text  extract  of  the  attachment  identified  by
              &lt;cyrus-id&gt;  then  it  may  return  HTTP  status  code  200  (OK) and the plain text extract with a
              Content-Type "text/plain" header. Otherwise it must return HTTP status 404 (Not Found).

              3. If Cyrus receives the HTTP status code 404 (Not Found), then it sends a PUT request to the same
              URL as previously. The PUT request body contains the decoded, binary body of the  attachment.  The
              Content-Type request header has the same value as declared in the MIME part headers, including any
              type parameters.

              4.  The  extractor  must  return  the  plain  text extract with either HTTP status 200 (OK) or 201
              (Created) and a Content-Type "text/plain" header.  If no text can be extracted, then the extractor
              may return any return code in the range 4xx, or 200 and an empty response body.

              Any other HTTP status code is treated as an error. For  performance  reasons,  the  Cyrus  indexer
              attempts to keep-alive the TCP connection to the extractor.  Xapian only.

          <b>search_attachment_extractor_request_timeout:</b> 5m
              Defines  the  duration  after  which  to  cancel  non-responding requests to the search attachment
              extractor service.

          <b>search_attachment_extractor_idle_timeout:</b> 5m
              Defines the duration after which to close unused connections to the  search  attachment  extractor
              service.  If the idle timeout is less than search_attachment_extractor_request_timeout, then it is
              ignored and request timeout used instead.

              If no unit is specified, seconds is assumed.

          <b>search_index_language:</b> 0

          <b>search_index_headers:</b> 1
              Whether to index headers other than From, To, Cc, Bcc, and Subject.  Experiment  shows  that  some
              headers  such  as  Received  and  DKIM-Signature can contribute up to 2/3rds of the index size but
              almost nothing to the utility of searching.  Note that if header indexing is disabled, headers can
              still be searched, the searches will just be slower.

          <b>search_indexed_db:</b> twoskip
              The cyrusdb backend to use for the search latest indexed uid state.  Xapian only.

              When searching, how whitespace should be handled.  Options are: "skip" (default in 2.3 and earlier
              series) - where a search for "equi" would match "the quick brown fox".   "merge"  -  the  default,
              where  "he   qu"  would  match  "the  quick    brownfox",  and "keep", where whitespace must match
              exactly.  The default of "merge" is recommended for most cases -  it's  a  good  compromise  which
              keeps words separate.  Allowed values: <u>skip</u>, <u>merge</u>, <u>keep</u>

          <b>search_snippet_length:</b> 255
              The  maximum  byte  length  of a snippet generated by the XSNIPPETS command. Only supported by the
              Xapian search backend, which attempts to always fill search_snippet_length bytes in the  generated
              snippet.

          <b>search_stopword_path:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The  absolute base path to the search stopword lists. If not specified, no stopwords will be taken
              into account during search indexing. Currently, the only supported and default stop word  file  is
              english.txt.

          <b>searchpartition-name:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The  pathname  where  to  store the xapian search indexes of <u>searchtier</u> for mailboxes of partition
              <u>name</u>. This must be configured for the  <u>defaultsearchtier</u>  and  any  additional  search  tier  (see
              squatter for details).

              For  example:  if  <u>defaultpartition</u>  is  defined  as part1 and <u>defaultsearchtier</u> as tier1 then the
              configuration must contain an entry <u>tier1searchpartition-part1</u> that  defines  the  path  where  to
              store this tier1's search index for the part1 partition.

              This option MUST be specified for xapian search.

              If all backends are over that limit, this feature is not used anymore.

          <b>servername:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              This  is the hostname visible in the greeting messages of the POP, IMAP and LMTP daemons. If it is
              unset, then the result returned from <a href="../man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname</a>(2) is used.  This  is  also  the  value  used  by
              murder  clusters  to  identify the host name.  It should be resolvable by DNS to the correct host,
              and unique within an active cluster.  If you are using low level replication (e.g. drbd)  then  it
              should  be  the  same  on  each  copy  and  the DNS name should also be moved to the new master on
              failover.

          <b>serverinfo:</b> on
              The server information to display  in  the  greeting  and  capability  responses.  Information  is

          <b>singleinstancestore:</b> 1
              If enabled, imapd, lmtpd and nntpd attempt to only write one copy of a message per  partition  and
              create hard links, resulting in a potentially large disk savings.

          <b>skiplist_always_checkpoint:</b> 1
              If  enabled,  this  option  forces  the skiplist cyrusdb backend to always checkpoint when doing a
              recovery.  This causes slightly more IO, but on the other hand leads to more efficient  databases,
              and the entire file is already "hot".

          <b>skiplist_unsafe:</b> 0
              If  enabled,  this  option  forces  the  skiplist  cyrusdb backend to not sync writes to the disk.
              Enabling this option is NOT RECOMMENDED.

          <b>smtp_backend:</b> sendmail
              The SMTP backend to use for sending email.

              The "host" backend sends message submissions via a TCP socket to the  SMTP  host  defined  in  the
              config option smtp_host.

              The  "sendmail"  backend  forks the Cyrus process into the executable defined in the config option
              sendmail.  The executable must accept "-bs" as command line argument, read  from  stdin  and  must
              implement the minimum SMTP protocol as defined in section 4.5.1 of <u>RFC</u> <u>5321</u>.

              If  the  SMTP  EHLO  command  reports AUTH (<u>RFC</u> <u>4954</u>) as a supported extension, then the MAIL FROM
              command includes the AUTH parameter, with its value set to the  name  of  any  authenticated  user
              which  triggered  the  email.  The AUTH parameter is omitted if the user is unknown to the calling
              process.

              If the directory  <u>configdirectory</u>/log/smtpclient.<u>smtp_backend</u>  exists,  then  telemetry  logs  for
              outgoing SMTP sessions will be created in this directory.

              Authentication  is enabled if smtp_auth_authname is set. Authentication can be explicitly disabled
              by appending "/noauth" to the host address.

          <b>smtp_auth_authname:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The authentication name to use when authenticating to the SMTP server defined in smtp_host.

              currently  lists  what  special-use  attributes can be set. This allows extending that list in the
              future or adding your own if needed.

          <b>specialuse_nochildren:</b> \Scheduled \Snooze
              Whitespace separated list of special-use attributes that may not contain child folders.   If  set,
              mailboxes  with  any  of these attributes may not have child folders created, and these attributes

              Enable replication action logging by sync_server as well, allowing chaining of replicas.  Use this
              on 'B' for A =&gt; B =&gt; C replication layout.

          <b>sync_log_channels:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              If  specified,  log  all  events to multiple log files in directories specified by each "channel".
              Each channel can then be processed separately, such as  by  multiple  <a href="../man8/sync_client.8.html">sync_client</a>(8)s  in  a  mesh
              replication scheme, or by <a href="../man8/squatter.8.html">squatter</a>(8) for rolling search index updates.

              You can use "" (the two-character string U+22 U+22) to mean the default sync channel.

          <b>sync_log_unsuppressable_channels:</b> squatter
              If  specified,  the  named channels are exempt from the effect of setting sync_log_chain:off, i.e.
              they are always logged to by the sync_server process.  This is only really useful to allow rolling
              search indexing on a replica.

          <b>sync_password:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The default password to use when authenticating to a sync server.  Prefix with a channel  name  to
              only apply for that channel.

          <b>sync_port:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Name  of  the  service (or port number) of the replication service on replica host.  Prefix with a
              channel name to only apply for that channel.  If not specified, and if  sync_try_imap  is  set  to
              "yes"  (the  default),  then  the  replication client will first try "imap" (port 143) to check if
              imapd supports replication.  Otherwise it will default to "csync" (usually port 2005).

          <b>sync_realm:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              The authentication realm to use when authenticating to a sync server.  Prefix with a channel  name
              to only apply for that channel.

          <b>sync_reconnect_maxwait:</b> 20m
              When sync_client cannot connect to the replica, it enters a retry loop with an exponential backoff
              between  attempts.   This  option  sets the upper limit on that exponential backoff: no matter how
              long  the  replica  has  been  down  so   far,   sync_client   will   never   wait   longer   than
              sync_reconnect_maxwait between retries.

              If  this  is  zero or negative, the backoff duration will be allowed to increase indefinitely (not
              recommended).

              If no unit is specified, seconds is assumed.

          <b>sync_repeat_interval:</b> 1s
              Minimum interval between replication runs in rolling replication mode. If a replication run  takes
              longer  than  this time, we repeat immediately.  Prefix with a channel name to only apply for that
              channel.

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, seconds is assumed.

          <b>sync_rightnow_channel:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              if set, run sync_client to this channel immediately.  As with channels, set this value to '""'  to
              sync the default channel!

          <b>sync_shutdown_file:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Simple  latch  used to tell <a href="../man8/sync_client.8.html">sync_client</a>(8) that it should shut down at the next opportunity. Safer
              than sending signals to running processes.  Prefix with a channel name  to  only  apply  for  that
              channel.

          <b>sync_timeout:</b> 30m
              How  long  to wait for a response before returning a timeout failure when talking to a replication
              peer (client or server).  The minimum duration is 3 seconds, the default is 30 minutes.

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, seconds is assumed.

          <b>sync_try_imap:</b> 1
              Whether sync_client should try to perform an IMAP connection before falling  back  to  csync.   If
              this  is  set  to "no", sync_client will only use csync.  Prefix with a channel name to apply only
              for that channel.

          <b>syslog_prefix:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              String to be prepended to the process name in syslog entries. Can be further overridden by setting
              the $CYRUS_SYSLOG_PREFIX environment variable.

              Using the $CYRUS_SYSLOG_PREFIX environment variable has the additional advantage that  it  can  be
              set  before  the <b>imapd.conf</b> is read, so errors while reading the config file can be syslogged with
              the correct prefix.

          <b>syslog_facility:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Configure a syslog facility.  The default is whatever is compiled in.  Allowed values are: DAEMON,
              MAIL, NEWS, USER, and LOCAL0 through to LOCAL7

          <b>tcp_keepalive:</b> 0
              Enable keepalive on TCP connections.

          <b>tcp_keepalive_cnt:</b> 0
              Number of TCP keepalive probes to send before declaring the connection dead (0 == system default).

          <b>tcp_keepalive_idle:</b> 0
              How long a connection must be idle before keepalive probes are sent (0 == system default).

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, seconds is assumed.

          <b>tcp_keepalive_intvl:</b> 0
              Time between keepalive probes (0 == system default).

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, seconds is assumed.

          <b>temp_path:</b> <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>
              The pathname to store temporary files in. It is recommended to use an in-memory filesystem such as
              tmpfs for this path.

          <b>telemetry_bysessionid:</b> 0
              If true, log by sessionid instead of PID for telemetry.

          <b>timeout:</b> 32m
              The length of the IMAP server's inactivity autologout timer.  The minimum  value  is  30  minutes.
              The default is 32 minutes, to allow a bit of leeway for clients that try to NOOP every 30 minutes.

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, minutes is assumed.

          <b>imapidletimeout:</b> &lt;none&gt;
              Timeout  for  idling clients (<u>RFC</u> <u>2177</u>).  If not set (the default), the value of "timeout" will be
              used instead.

              For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, minutes is assumed.
