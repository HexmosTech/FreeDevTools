</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cvsgraph.conf - CVS/RCS repository grapher configuration

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration  file is a context free grammar where empty lines and whitespace are ignored. Comments
       start with '#' and everything until end of line is ignored.
       A configuration parameter is written as:
            &lt;keyword&gt; = &lt;argument&gt; ;

       Keywords are defined in <b>PARAMETERS</b>. The argument can be either numerical or string typed.

       Numbers may be entered as octal, decimal or hex as in 0117, 79  and  0x4f  respectively.  Floating  point
       numbers contain a single '.', but must start with a digit. Integer numbers are automagically converted to
       floats if required.

       Strings  are  C-style  strings, enclosed in double quotes in which characters may be escaped with '\' and
       written in octal and hex escapes. Note that '\' must be escaped if it is to be entered  as  a  character.
       Escapes recognized are '\[abfnrtv]', '\[xX][0-9a-fA-F]{2}' and '\[012][0-7]{0,2}'.
       Some  strings  are  expanded with printf like conversions which start with '%'. Not all are applicable at
       all times, in which case they will expand to nothing.
       Note that expansions of paths are available with and without trailing '/'. The  distinction  is  required
       for  path  construction  to ensure that empty expansions will not redirect the path to root and no double
       '/' in a path is generated.

       %c     CVS root including a trailing '/' if non-empty

       %C     CVS root without trailing '/', regardless of how it was entered on the command line

       %m     CVS module including trailing '/' if non-empty

       %M     CVS module without trailing '/', regardless of how it was entered on the command line

       %f     filename without path (<u>basename</u> <u>&lt;name&gt;</u> functionality)

       %F     filename without path and with ",v" stripped (<u>basename</u> <u>&lt;name&gt;</u> <u>,v</u> functionality)

       %p     path part of filename. This includes a trailing '/' if the path is non-empty

       %r     number of revisions

       %b     number of branches

       %%     literal '%'

       %R     the revision number (e.g. '1.2.4.4')

       %P     previous revision number

       %B     the branch number (e.g. '1.2.4')

       %d     date of revision

       %a     author of revision

       %s     state of revision

       %l     The log entry of the revision. You need to enable <b>parse_logs</b> for this to work. You may  append  an
              optional truncate length by writing '[num]' (with num the maximum length) directly after %l. If no
              truncation  is specified, then all will be expanded. Specifying a negative truncation length means
              that newlines should be replaced by spaces. If truncation occurs, then "..." will be appended. The
              expansion is scanned for possible HTML entities and are replaced by &amp;#...; equivalents.
              For example: "%l[25]" will expand up to 25 characters of the log.
              Note: This expansion is obsolete. Please use "%(%L%)"; see comment below.

       %L     Same as %l, but no HTML entity translations are performed.

       %t     current tag of branch or revision

       %0..%9 command-line argument -0 .. -9

       %(...%)
              HTMLize the string withing the parenthesis. This is  useful  to  prevent  a  possible  cross  site
              scripting  bug  when  expanding tags into the map generation.  For an exploit, you need to have an
              attack on your CVS server, or you need to be a complete idiot to enter a tag with '&lt;', '&gt;' or  '"'
              characters.
              Example:  a  string  "%(%t%)",  with  tag  <b>&gt;&lt;script</b>  <b>xxx="..."&gt;&lt;</b>  will  expand  to  <b>&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script</b>
              <b>xxx=&amp;#34;...&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;</b> and not into the execution of a script.
              Note: This method is preferred to the %l expansion, because it is more generic solution (i.e.  use
              "%(%L%)" for log expansions).

       Fonts are numbered 0..4 (as defined in libgd) where 0 = tiny, 1 = small, 2 = medium (bold), 3 = large and
       4 = giant.

       Colors are strings, similar to HTML type colors in the form "#rrggbb" with parts written in hex, where rr
       = red (00-ff), gg = green (00-ff) and bb = blue (00-ff).

       Colors and some strings can also be defined as conditional expressions so that revision/branch conditions
       can be repesented visually:
         color/string = [ "key" op "content" truecase falsecase ];
       Operator 'op' can be one of:

       =~     contained in regex

       =*     contained in regex, case insensitive

       !~     not contained in regex

       !*     not contained in regex, case insensitive

       &lt;      less than string, timestamp or rev/branch number

       &lt;=     less or equal than string, timestamp or rev/branch number

       &gt;      greater than string, timestamp or rev/branch number

       &gt;=     greater or equal than string, timestamp or rev/branch number

       ==     equal than string, timestamp or rev/branch number

       !=     not equal than string, timestamp or rev/branch number

       The 'content' is one of:
           * POSIX 1003.2 extended regular expression
           * timestamp in UTC format: YYYY[.MM[.DD[.hh[.mm[.ss]]]]]
           * revision or branch number

       The 'key' can be one of:

       state  State of the revision

       author The auther of a revision

       tag    both revision- and branch-tags

       date   date of the revision

       rev    numeric revision- or branch-number

       Both  'truecase' and 'falsecase' can be either a (color-)string, as described above, or a new conditional
       expression.  Examples:
           rev_bgcolor = [ "state" =~ "dead" "#e08080" "#f0f0f0" ];
           branch_color= [ "rev" &lt; "2.1.2" "#000000" [ "tag" =~ "XyZ.*" "#123456" "#654321" ] ];
           rev_idtext  = [ "state" == "dead" "Dead %R" "%R" ]
       Note that not all colors can be changed on the fly. For example, branch_color cannot be be changed  based
       on  revision  identification  (i.e.  author, date or state). The color_bg is always unique and fixed (all
       expressions will evaluate to the  false  case).   Also,  only  string  rev_text  and  rev_idtext  can  be
       conditional expressions as other do not make much sense to be dynamic.

       Booleans  have three possible arguments: true, false and not. `Not' means inverse of what it was (logical
       negation) and is represented by the value -1.  For the configuration file that  means  that  the  default
       value is negated.  However, the not possibility is a very handy tool for command line overrides generated
       from (CGI) scripts.

       There  are  several  reserved  words  besides of the keywords.  These additional reserved words expand to
       numerical values:
       Booleans:
            false  = 0
            true   = 1
            not    = -1
       Alignment specifiers:
            left   = 0
            center = 1
            right  = 2
       Image specifiers:
            gif    = 0
            png    = 1
            jpeg   = 2
       Font specifiers:
            tiny   = 0
            small  = 1
            medium = 2
            large  = 3
            giant  = 4
       HTML level specifiers:
            HTML3  = 1
            HTML4  = 2
            XHTML  = 3

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cvsroot</b> <u>string</u>
              The absolute base directory where the CVS/RCS repository can be found.  A '/' will be appended  to
              the string if it is not empty and does not contain a trailing '/'.
              Default is an empty string.

       <b>cvsmodule</b> <u>string</u>
              The  module  name  in  the  CVS/RCS  repository. This is converted into a subdirectory name with a
              trailing '/'.
              Default is an empty string.

       <b>color_bg</b> <u>color</u>
              The background color of the image.
              Default is white ("#ffffff").

       <b>transparent_bg</b> <u>boolean</u>
              The background color of the image is to be the transparent color. This  is  only  useful  for  PNG
              images.  Be  sure  to set <b>color_bg</b> to something reasonable to make sure that the image is viewable
              with programs that do not support transparency.
              Default is false.

       <b>date_format</b> <u>string</u>
              The <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3)</b> format string for date and time representation in the '%d' expansion.
              Default is "%d-%b-%Y %H:%M:%S".

       <b>box_shadow</b> <u>boolean</u>
              A boolean whether or not to draw a shadow for the boxes of revisions and branches.
              Default is false.

       <b>upside_down</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Draw the entire tree upside down if set. I.e. highest revisions are at the top of the  image.  See
              also <b><a href="../man1/cvsgraph.1.html">cvsgraph</a>(1)</b> option '<b>-u</b>'.
              Default is false.

       <b>left_right</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Draw the entire tree from left to right instead of top down if set.  I.e. highest revisions are at
              the right of the image. You can also draw the tree right to left when <b>upside_down</b> is set too.
              Default is false.

       <b>strip_untagged</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Omit  all revisions that do not have tags and are not a branch point. This reduces the image-size,
              but can be confusing when looking for a specific revision. See also <b><a href="../man1/cvsgraph.1.html">cvsgraph</a>(1)</b> option '<b>-s</b>'.
              Default is false.

       <b>strip_first_rev</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Also omit the first revision in a branch if it does not have tags and is not a branch point.  This
              has only effect if <b>strip_untagged</b> is set. See also <b><a href="../man1/cvsgraph.1.html">cvsgraph</a>(1)</b> option '<b>-S</b>'.
              Default is false.

       <b>auto_stretch</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Try  to  stretch  the  inter-revision  spacing  to  move  the trunks more to the left, effectively
              reducing the image's size. See also <b><a href="../man1/cvsgraph.1.html">cvsgraph</a>(1)</b> option '<b>-k</b>'.
              Default is false.

       <b>use_ttf</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Enable TrueType rendering of strings using  the  FreeType  interface  of  libgd.   Note  that  ttf
              rendering is significantly slower than libgd's bitmap fonts.
              Default is false.

       <b>anti_alias</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Enable  antialias  rendering  of  TrueType fonts. This has only effect if <b>use_ttf</b> is set. Enabling
              anti_alias gives very nice results.  However, that is at the expense of 8-bit vs.  4-bit  colormap
              images, which can be a major drawback because the size of 8-bit images is 3..4 times that of 4-bit
              images (with compressed PNG as output).
              Default is true.

       <b>thick_lines</b> <u>number</u>
              Set  the thickness of connector lines between boxes. Normally, lines are drawn one pixel wide, but
              can look somewhat thin. Setting the thickness to anything over 5 would be plain ugly (but hey, who
              is to debate taste :-).  Values less than 1 and over 11 are clipped.
              Default is 1.

       <b>parse_logs</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Enable the parsing of the <u>entire</u> ,v file to  read  the  log-entries  between  revisions.  This  is
              necessary for the %l expansion to work, but slows down parsing by a very large factor. You've been
              warned.
              Default is false.

       <b>html_level</b> <u>number</u>
              Set  the  compliance to different types of HTML. The generated image map is slightly different for
              version 3.x, 4.x and XHTML. You can use the predefined identifiers (HTML3, HTML4 and XHTML) to set
              this value. Command line option '<b>-x</b>' overrides the setting.
              Default is HTML3 (3.x compatibility).

       <b>branch_ttfont</b> <u>string</u>

       <b>branch_tag_ttfont</b> <u>string</u>

       <b>rev_ttfont</b> <u>string</u>

       <b>rev_text_ttfont</b> <u>string</u>

       <b>tag_ttfont</b> <u>string</u>

       <b>title_ttfont</b> <u>string</u>

       <b>msg_ttfont</b> <u>string</u>
              Set the TrueType font face or filename for the individual elements. Gd's bitmap fonts are used  as
              a fallback if the font cannot be found or contains errors.
              Default none.

       <b>branch_ttsize</b> <u>float</u>

       <b>branch_tag_ttsize</b> <u>float</u>

       <b>rev_ttsize</b> <u>float</u>

       <b>rev_text_ttsize</b> <u>float</u>

       <b>tag_ttsize</b> <u>float</u>

       <b>title_ttsize</b> <u>float</u>

       <b>msg_ttsize</b> <u>float</u>
              Set the TrueType font size for the individual elements. See also *_ttfont.
              Default 0.0.

       <b>tag_font</b> <u>number</u>
              The font used to draw tags in the revision boxes.
              Default is tiny.

       <b>tag_color</b> <u>color</u>
              The color used to draw tags in the revision boxes.
              Default is black ("#000000").

       <b>tag_ignore</b> <u>string</u>
              An  extended  regular  expression  as  described  in <b><a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex</a>(7)</b> to match all tags that should not be
              displayed  in  the  graph.  Note  that  a  tag  will  always  be  displayed  if  it  matches   the
              <b>merge_from</b>/<b>merge_to</b> expressions regardless to it being set to ignore here.
              Example: tag_ignore = "(test|alpha)_release.*";
              Default is empty (no matching occurs).

       <b>tag_nocase</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Ignore the case in regex matching in <b>tag_ignore</b>.
              Default is false.

       <b>tag_negate</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Negate  the  matching  criteria  of the <b>tag_ignore</b> setting. If set, tags that match the <b>tag_ignore</b>
              will be shown, instead of matches being ignored. In any case, tags that match  <b>merge_from</b>/<b>merge_to</b>
              expressions will never be suppressed.
              Default is false.

       <b>tag_ignore_merge</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If  set, then tags matched with <b>tag_ignore</b> will no longer be considered for matching by <b>merge_from</b>
              and <b>merge_to</b>.
              Default is false.

       <b>rev_font</b> <u>number</u>
              Default is tiny.

       <b>rev_color</b> <u>color</u>
              The color of revision boxes, including the revision number.
              Default is black ("#000000").

       <b>rev_bgcolor</b> <u>color</u>
              Revision box background color. This is the interior fill of the box.
              Default is white ("#ffffff").

       <b>rev_separator</b> <u>number</u>
              Space between tags in revision boxes.
              Default is 0.

       <b>rev_minline</b> <u>number</u>
              The minimum vertical distance between revision boxes.
              Default is 0.

       <b>rev_maxline</b> <u>number</u>
              The maximum vertical distance between revision boxes.  This has only effect if <b>auto_stretch</b> is set
              to true (or option '<b>-k</b>' is specified).
              Default is 5 times <b>rev_minline</b>.

       <b>rev_lspace</b> <u>number</u>

       <b>rev_rspace</b> <u>number</u>

       <b>rev_tspace</b> <u>number</u>

       <b>rev_bspace</b> <u>number</u>
              Interior spacing in revision boxes of left, right, top and bottom respectively. Note that the left
              right spacing is not used separately because text is center aligned.
              Default is 0.

       <b>rev_idtext</b> <u>conditional</u> <u>string</u>
              The revision ID or revision number in a revision box.
              Default is "%R".

       <b>rev_text</b> <u>conditional</u> <u>string</u>
              The additional text in a revision box under the revision number.
              Default is "%d".

       <b>rev_text_font</b> <u>number</u>
              The font of the additional text in a revision box under the revision number.
              Default is tiny.

       <b>rev_text_color</b> <u>color</u>
              The font color of the additional text in a revision box under the revision number.
              Default is black ("#000000").

       <b>rev_maxtags</b> <u>number</u>
              Limit the number of tags in a revision box. Old trees tend to have some revisions  with  extremely
              many  tags attached, which would generate a huge revision box when drawn. Limiting the number is a
              fair solution. Note that tag sorting is not specified in the <b><a href="../man7/rcsfile.7.html">rcsfile</a>(7)</b>, but <b><a href="../man1/cvs.1.html">cvs</a>(1)</b> will  normally
              have  the newest tags located before older ones. Therefore, limiting the number of tags would most
              likely only affect older tags to be stripped.  However, no guarantees are given  that  a  specific
              tag  is present when the limit is imposed. An ellipsis (...) is shown in the revision box when the
              number of tags got truncated.
              Default is 0, meaning all tags shown.

       <b>rev_hidenumber</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If set, then no revision number is displayed in the revisionboxes. This  reduces  size  for  those
              graphs where the actual revision-number is irrelevant.
              Default is false.

       <b>msg_font</b> <u>number</u>
              The font used to draw error and warning messages at the bottom of the graph.
              Default is tiny.

       <b>msg_color</b> <u>color</u>
              The color used to draw error and warning messages.
              Default is black ("#000000").

       <b>merge_color</b> <u>color</u>
              The color of the lines to show merges.
              Default is black ("#000000").

       <b>merge_front</b> <u>boolean</u>
              The  merge  lines  are  drawn  on  top  of  the  image  if  true. Otherwise, merge lines are drawn
              underneath.
              Default is false.

       <b>merge_nocase</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Ignore the case in regex matching in <b>merge_from</b> and <b>merge_to</b>.
              Default is false.

       <b>merge_from</b> <u>string</u>
              The <b>merge_from</b> is an extended regular expression as described in <b><a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex</a>(7)</b> and  POSIX  1003.2  (see
              also  Single  Unix  Specification at <a href="http://www.opengroup.com">http://www.opengroup.com</a> ). The matching tags describe source
              revisions of merges. Each match is subsequently used in  a  search  for  the  destination  tag  as
              described by the <b>merge_to</b> parameter.
              Note: normal string rules apply. Therefore, all backslashes '\' must be escaped, e.g. "\." must be
              written as "\\.".
              Example: merge_from = "^from_(.*)";
              Default is empty (no matching occurs).

       <b>merge_to</b> <u>string</u>
              The  <b>merge_to</b>  is  an  extended  regular  expression  with  a  twist.  All subexpressions from the
              <b>merge_from</b> are expanded into <b>merge_to</b> using %[1-9] (in contrast  to  \[1-9]  for  backreferences).
              Care  is  taken  to escape the constructed expression. A '$' at the end of the <b>merge_to</b> expression
              can be important to prevent 'near match' references. Normally, you want the destination  to  be  a
              good  representation  of the source. However, this depends on how well you defined the tags in the
              first place.
              Example: merge_to = "^merge_%1$";
              Above example, combined with the merge_from example would match a tag  "from_BugFix_2002"  to  the
              merge-destination with tag "merge_BugFix_2002".
              Default is empty (no matching occurs).

       <b>merge_findall</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Normally,  <b>merge_from</b>/m<b>erge_to</b>  will  only find the first matching tag-combination and draw a line
              between them, If <b>merge_findall</b> is set, then all matching <b>merge_to</b>s will result in lines  from  the
              from-tag to the to-tag.
              Default is false.

       <b>merge_arrows</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Enable the use of arrows pointing to the merge destination.
              Default is true.

       <b>merge_on_tag</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Draw  merge lines originating from/to the actual tags that are matched when <b>left_right</b> is enabled.
              This improves the usability of the lines  drawn  but  can  under  circumstances  be  difficult  to
              visualize without revision boxes overlapping the lines and arrows.
              Default is false.

       <b>merge_cvsnt</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Enable drawing of mergepoints as used by CVSNT.
              Default is true.

       <b>merge_cvsnt_color</b> <u>color</u>
              The color of the lines to show merges from mergepoints.
              Default is black ("#000000").

       <b>arrow_width</b> <u>number</u>

       <b>arrow_length</b> <u>number</u>
              Specifies the size of the arrow pointing to the merge destination.
              Default is arrow_width=3, arrow_length=12.

       <b>branch_font</b> <u>number</u>
              The font of the number in a branch box.
              Default is tiny.

       <b>branch_tag_font</b> <u>number</u>
              The font of the tags in a branch box.
              Default is tiny.

       <b>branch_color</b> <u>color</u>
              All branch element's color excluding tags.
              Default is black ("#000000").

       <b>branch_bgcolor</b> <u>color</u>
              Branch box background color. This is the interior fill of the box.
              Default is white ("#ffffff").

       <b>branch_tag_color</b> <u>color</u>
              All branch tags' color.
              Default is black ("#000000").

       <b>branch_lspace</b> <u>number</u>

       <b>branch_rspace</b> <u>number</u>

       <b>branch_tspace</b> <u>number</u>

       <b>branch_bspace</b> <u>number</u>
              Interior spacing of branch boxes.
              Default is 0.

       <b>branch_margin</b> <u>number</u>
              Exterior spacing of branches. Each branch will be spaced with a minimum of this value.
              Default is 0.

       <b>branch_connect</b> <u>number</u>
              Length of the vertical connector from a revision to the branch box.
              Default is 0.

       <b>branch_dupbox</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Add  an extra branch box at the end of the trunk. Useful for upside down drawn trees. If there are
              no commits on a branch, then no extra box is added, regardless of the setting of this option.
              Default is false.

       <b>branch_fold</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Fold branches that have no commits into one branch-box. This helps  to  reduce  the  size  of  the
              overall  image by a huge factor (5..10 in most cases). Many applications of CVS use many branches,
              but not all files in  the  repository  change  for  each  branch.  Especially  stable  files  line
              .cvsignore  or  older  code  tend  to accumulate many empty branches at one and the same revision.
              Folding these branches into one box reduces the width of these images considerably.
              Default is true.

       <b>branch_foldall</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Fold all empty branches that sprout from the save revision in one box. If this option is not  set,
              then  multiple  boxes  will  be  created if the empty branches are interspaced with ones that have
              revisions attached. When this option is set, then all empty branches will  be  collected  and  put
              into  the  box  of  the first occurring empty branch on the revision's branch point.  Setting this
              option will reduce image size with interspaced commits to the a maximum.
              Default is false.

       <b>branch_resort</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Resort the branches according to the number of revisions they  have,  where  less  revisions  will
              stick  closer  to  the sprouting trunk. This will reduce image size under circumstances where many
              branches have significant different number of revisions.
              Default is false.

       <b>branch_subtree</b> <u>string</u>
              Reduce the tree only to include the subtree from the branch-number given in the argument.  If  the
              argument  is  a revision which is the root of branches, then all those branches will be shown. The
              argument can also be a symbolic tag (either a branch- or revision-tag).  You  normally  would  set
              this option from the command line with the -O option for interactive flexibility.
              Example: branch_subtree = "1.2.4";
              Default is empty (all branches shown).

       <b>title</b> <u>string</u>
              The title of the image.
              Default is empty string.

       <b>title_x</b> <u>number</u>

       <b>title_y</b> <u>number</u>
              Position of title.
              Default is 0.

       <b>title_font</b> <u>number</u>
              The font of the title.
              Default is tiny.

       <b>title_align</b> <u>number</u>
              Horizontal alignment of the title.
              Default is left.

       <b>title_color</b> <u>color</u>
              The color of the title.
              Default is black ("#000000").

       <b>margin_top</b> <u>number</u>

       <b>margin_bottom</b> <u>number</u>

       <b>margin_left</b> <u>number</u>

       <b>margin_right</b> <u>number</u>
              Margins of the image. Note: the title position is not affected by the margin.
              Default is 0.

       <b>image_type</b> <u>number</u>
              Image  types are available if they can be found in the gd library. Some versions of gd do not have
              gif, although newer version have it implemented again.  CvsGraph will automatically  generate  png
              images if gif is not available.
              Default is dependent on availability and is prioritized in the order png, gif and jpeg.

       <b>image_quality</b> <u>number</u>
              The quality of a jpeg image (1..100)
              Default is 100.

       <b>image_compress</b> <u>number</u>
              Set  the compression level of png images (-1..9). Zero means no compression. A higher number means
              higher compression. Minus one selects the default library setting.
              Default is -1.

       <b>image_interlace</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Write png and jpeg images in interlaced format. This enables progressive loading in  your  browser
              (if supported).
              Default is false.

       <b>map_name</b> <u>string</u>
              The name= attribute in &lt;map name="mapname"&gt;...&lt;/map&gt; in the generated HTML map.
              Default is "CvsGraphImageMap".

       <b>map_branch_href</b> <u>string</u>

       <b>map_rev_href</b> <u>string</u>

       <b>map_diff_href</b> <u>string</u>

       <b>map_merge_href</b> <u>string</u>
              These are the href= attributes in the &lt;area&gt; tags of HTML.
              Default are:
              branch: "href=\"unset: conf.map_branch_href\""
              revision: "href=\"unset: conf.map_rev_href\""
              diff: "href=\"unset: conf.map_diff_href\""
              merge: "href=\"unset: conf.map_merge_href\""

       <b>map_branch_alt</b> <u>string</u>

       <b>map_rev_alt</b> <u>string</u>

       <b>map_diff_alt</b> <u>string</u>

       <b>map_merge_alt</b> <u>string</u>
              These are the alt= attributes in the &lt;area&gt; tags of HTML.
              Default  are  "alt=\"%B\"",  "alt=\"%R\"", "alt=\"%P &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; %R\"" and "alt=\"%P &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; %R\""
              respectively.
