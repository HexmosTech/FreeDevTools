</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lg.conf - looking glass configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lg.conf</b> contains configuration for the looking glass scripts.

       The  syntax  is  that  of  <u><a href="../man1/perl.1.html">perl</a></u>(1).   It is used to set variables that affect run-time behavior and/or to
       locate resources.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following variables are used (alphabetically):

       <b>LG_AS_REG</b>
              *** not implemented.

       <b>LG_BGP_RT</b>
              Allows show ip bgp neighbor commands that can produce heavy output, such as  sh  ip  bgp  neighbor
              &lt;ip&gt;  advertised-routes  for  a  transit  customer  when  the  neighbor  address  is  followed  by
              'advertised-routes' for the sh ip bgp neighbor query.

       <b>LG_CACHE_DIR</b>
              Sets the location of the cache directory.  The looking glass uses this to  hold  lock  files,  log
              files, and output from cached commands.

              Default: .<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>

              Note that the default is relative to the directory where <u>lg.cgi</u> runs in the server's document root
              (e.g.: /usr/local/www/data/lg/tmp).

       <b>LG_CACHE_TIME</b>
              Sets  the  number of seconds that the looking glass should cache output from commands that tend to
              produce a lot of output, such as 'show ip bgp dampened-paths'.

              Default: 600

       <b>LG_CLOGINRC</b>
              Defines the location of the <b><a href="../man5/cloginrc.5.html">cloginrc</a></b>(5) that the looking  glass  should  use.   The  path  may  be
              relative to the directory where the CGI scripts run in the server's document root.

              Default: $HOME/.cloginrc

              Note  that  the  .cloginrc  must be readable by the user or group that will be running the CGI and
              that <b><a href="../man1/clogin.1.html">clogin</a></b>(1) will not allow a world readable <u>.cloginrc</u>.  The user is normally that of  the  http
              server (httpd).

       <b>LG_IMAGE</b>
              Defines  a  html  image  tag (&lt;img&gt;) which, if defined, will be included at the top of the looking
              glass pages.  It may contain any html as it is simply handed off to print().

              Example: $LG_IMAGE="&lt;img src=/icons/rancid.gif hspace=0&gt;\n &lt;font size=+2&gt;FOO&lt;/font&gt;";

       <b>LG_INFO</b>
              Defines information in html format which, if defined, will  be  included  at  the  bottom  of  the
              looking glass form page.  It may contain any html as it is simply handed off to print().

              Example: $LG_INFO="For Support contact &lt;a href=mailto:webmaster@localhost&gt;webmaster&lt;/a&gt;";

       <b>LG_LOG</b> Defines  the  fully  qualified path name (i.e.: begins with '/') for the log file or the <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3)
              facility to use for logging.  For syslog, the argument is the lowercase name of a syslog  facility
              (see syslog.h) without the 'LOG_' prefix.

              Example: local0

              Default: $LG_CACHE_DIR/lg.log

       <b>LG_ROUTERDB</b>
              Sets  the  location  for the <u>router.db</u> file in rancid's <b><a href="../man5/router.db.5.html">router.db</a></b>(5) format.  It lists the devices
              that should be available to the looking glass users.  Only those devices of  supported  types  and
              with  state  'up'  are  made  available.   If not defined and the default file does not exist, the
              looking glass will compile a list from the router.db files of all the groups  present  in  rancid,
              that is, the list will be a concatenation of the available <u><a href="../man5/router.db.5.html">router.db</a></u>(5) files.

              Note  that  if  the  concatenation  method  is  used, it may be necessary to alter the mode of the
              router.db files in the rancid  group  directories,  since  rancid's  default  umask  is  027  (see
              <b><a href="../man5/rancid.conf.5.html">rancid.conf</a></b>(5)).

       <b>LG_STRIP</b>
              Causes  the  LG  to  strip  login  information from the looking glass results.  Since Expect often
              munges disabling echo when passwords are entered, this  is  a  SECURITY  CONCERN!   However,  this
              output can be very useful for debugging clogin problems.

       <b>LG_STYLE</b>
              Defines the URL of a style sheet to be used for HTML formatting.

       <b>PATH</b>   Is  a colon separated list of directory pathnames in the file system where rancid's login scripts,
              <u><a href="../man1/clogin.1.html">clogin</a></u>(1) etc.)  and programs needed within these, such as <u><a href="../man1/telnet.1.html">telnet</a></u>(1), are located.  Its  value  is
              set  by  configure.  Should it be necessary to modify PATH, note that it must include $BASEDIR/bin
              (see above).

       Queries        ...................................

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>LG_CONF</b>
              Location of <b>lg.conf</b> file.  See the <u>FILES</u> section for more information.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lg.conf</b> is interpreted directly by <u><a href="../man1/perl.1.html">perl</a></u>(1), so its syntax  follows  that  of  perl.   Syntax  errors  may
       produce quite unexpected results.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/rancid/lg.conf</b>
              Configuration file described here.

              <b>lg.conf</b>  is  located by the value of the environment variable LG_CONF, in the CWD (current working
              directory), or the sysconfdir defined when rancid was installed, in that order.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man5/cloginrc.5.html">cloginrc</a></b>(5), <b><a href="../man7/lg_intro.7.html">lg_intro</a></b>(7), <b><a href="../man5/router.db.5.html">router.db</a></b>(5)

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       In RANCID releases prior to 2.3, <b>lg.conf</b> was located in the util/lg sub-directory of  the  install  path.
       This was changed to be more consistent with common file location practices.
