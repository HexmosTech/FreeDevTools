</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       teamd.conf — libteam daemon configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       teamd uses JSON format configuration.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>device</b> (string)
              Desired name of new team device.

       <b>debug_level</b> (int)
              Level  of debug messages. The higher it is the more debug messages will be printed. It is the same
              as adding "-g" command line options.

              Default: <b>0</b> (disabled)

       <b>hwaddr</b> (string)
              Desired hardware address of new team device. Usual MAC address format is accepted.

       <b>runner.name</b> (string)
              Name of team device. The following runners are available:

              <b>broadcast</b> — Simple runner which directs the team device to transmit packets via all ports.

              <b>roundrobin</b> — Simple runner which directs the team device to transmits  packets  in  a  round-robin
              fashion.

              <b>random</b>  —  Simple runner which directs the team device to transmits packets on a randomly selected
              port.

              <b>activebackup</b> — Watches for link changes and selects active port to be used for data transfers.

              <b>loadbalance</b> — To do passive load balancing, runner only sets  up  BPF  hash  function  which  will
              determine  port  for  packet  transmit.  To  do  active  load balancing, runner moves hashes among
              available ports trying to reach perfect balance.

              <b>lacp</b> — Implements 802.3ad  LACP  protocol.  Can  use  same  Tx  port  selection  possibilities  as
              loadbalance runner.

              Default: <b>roundrobin</b>

       <b>notify_peers.count</b> (int)
              Number  of  bursts  of  unsolicited  NAs  and gratuitous ARP packets sent after port is enabled or
              disabled.

              Default: <b>0</b> (disabled)

              Default for activebackup runner: <b>1</b>

       <b>notify_peers.interval</b> (int)
              Value is positive number in milliseconds. Specifies an  interval  between  bursts  of  notify-peer
              packets.

              Default: <b>0</b>

       <b>mcast_rejoin.count</b> (int)
              Number of bursts of multicast group rejoin requests sent after port is enabled or disabled.

              Default: <b>0</b> (disabled)

              Default for activebackup runner: <b>1</b>

       <b>mcast_rejoin.interval</b> (int)
              Value  is positive number in milliseconds. Specifies an interval between bursts of multicast group
              rejoin requests.

              Default: <b>0</b>

       <b>link_watch.name</b> | <b>ports.PORTIFNAME.link_watch.name</b> (string)
              Name of link watcher to be used. The following link watchers are available:

              <b>ethtool</b> — Uses Libteam lib to get port ethtool state changes.

              <b>arp_ping</b> — ARP requests are sent through a port.  If  an  ARP  reply  is  received,  the  link  is
              considered to be up.

              <b>nsna_ping</b>  —  Similar  to  the previous, except that it uses IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation / Neighbor
              Advertisement mechanism. This is an  alternative  to  arp_ping  and  becomes  handy  in  pure-IPv6
              environments.

       <b>ports</b> (object)
              List of ports, network devices, to be used in a team device.

              <b>by_active</b> — Team device adopts the hardware address of the currently active port. This  is  useful
              when the port device is not able to change its hardware address.

              <b>only_active</b> — Only the active port adopts the hardware address of the team device. The others have
              their own.

              Default: <b>same_all</b>

       <b>ports.PORTIFNAME.prio</b> (int)

       <b>ports.PORTIFNAME.sticky</b> (bool)
              Flag  which  indicates if the port is sticky. If set, it means the port does not get unselected if

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       {
         "device": "team0",
         "runner": {"name": "roundrobin"},
         "ports": {"eth1": {}, "eth2": {}}
       }

       Very basic configuration.

       {
         "device": "team0",
         "runner": {"name": "activebackup"},
         "link_watch": {"name": "ethtool"},
         "ports": {
           "eth1": {
             "prio": -10,
             "sticky": true
           },
           "eth2": {
             "prio": 100
           }
         }
       }

       This  configuration  uses  active-backup runner with ethtool link watcher. Port eth2 has higher priority,
       but the sticky flag ensures that if eth1 becomes active, it stays active while the link remains up.

       {
         "device": "team0",
         "runner": {"name": "activebackup"},
         "link_watch": {
           "name": "ethtool",
           "delay_up": 2500,
           "delay_down": 1000
         },
         "ports": {
           "eth1": {
             "prio": -10,
             "sticky": true
           },
           "eth2": {
             "prio": 100
           }
         }
       }

       Similar to the previous one. Only difference is that link  changes  are  not  propagated  to  the  runner
       immediately, but delays are applied.

       {
         "device": "team0",
         "runner": {"name": "activebackup"},
         "link_watch":  {
           "name": "arp_ping",
           "interval": 100,
           "missed_max": 30,
           "target_host": "192.168.23.1"
         },
         "ports": {
           "eth1": {
             "prio": -10,
             "sticky": true
           },
           "eth2": {
             "prio": 100
           }
         }
       }

       This configuration uses ARP ping link watch.

       {
       "device": "team0",
       "runner": {"name": "activebackup"},
       "link_watch": [
         {
           "name": "arp_ping",
           "interval": 100,
           "missed_max": 30,
           "target_host": "192.168.23.1"
         },
         {
           "name": "arp_ping",
           "interval": 50,
           "missed_max": 20,
           "target_host": "192.168.24.1"
         }
       ],
       "ports": {
         "eth1": {
           "prio": -10,
           "sticky": true
         },
         "eth2": {
           "prio": 100
           }
         }
       }

       Similar to the previous one, only this time two link watchers are used at the same time.

       {
         "device": "team0",
         "runner": {
           "name": "loadbalance",
           "tx_hash": ["eth", "ipv4", "ipv6"]
         },
         "ports": {"eth1": {}, "eth2": {}}
       }

       Configuration for hash-based passive Tx load balancing.

       {
         "device": "team0",
         "runner": {
           "name": "loadbalance",
           "tx_hash": ["eth", "ipv4", "ipv6"],
           "tx_balancer": {
             "name": "basic"
           }
         },
         "ports": {"eth1": {}, "eth2": {}}
       }

       Configuration for active Tx load balancing using basic load balancer.

       {
         "device": "team0",
         "runner": {
           "name": "lacp",
           "active": true,
           "fast_rate": true,
           "tx_hash": ["eth", "ipv4", "ipv6"]
         },
         "link_watch": {"name": "ethtool"},
         "ports": {"eth1": {}, "eth2": {}}
       }

       Configuration for connection to LACP capable counterpart.
