</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       html2psrc - configuration file format for <a href="../man1/html2ps.1.html">html2ps</a>(1)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration  files are used for layout control, resource information etc. Normally, there should always
       exist a global configuration file.  In this file one typically specify things like: what image conversion
       packages are available on the system, the default paper size, the default text fonts and sizes, etc.

       For Unix and Windows systems, the installation script 'install' can be  used  to  automatically  build  a
       global  configuration  file  with all necessary definitions, and install all files. The files replaced by
       the installation are saved. If you for some reason are not satisfied with the new  version:  execute  the
       script 'backout' to reinstall your earlier version.

       On  other  systems,  you will have to manually create a global configuration file, and insert the name of
       this file into the html2ps script (close to the  beginning,  the  line  starting  with  "$globrc=").  The
       configuration  file  should  contain a package block, and perhaps paper and hyphenation blocks, described
       below.

       Each  user  can  then  have  a  personal  configuration   file   (by   default   $HOME/.html2psrc)   that
       complements/overrides the definitions made in the global file. It is also possible to specify alternative
       files on the command line, using the -f option.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       A configuration file can include other configuration files. This is done with:

          @import "<u>filename</u>";

       The  rest  of  the configuration file consists of zero or more blocks.  A block is given by a block name,
       followed by the block definition, as in:

          BODY {
            font-size: 12pt;
            font-family: Helvetica;
            text-align: justify
          }

       The block definition, enclosed by curly braces: { }, consists of key-value pairs and/or other  blocks.  A
       key-value  pair consists of the key name followed by a colon, followed by the value. Blocks and key-value
       pairs are separated by semicolons. The semicolon may be omitted after a block.

       Several blocks can share the same definition. The block names are then separated be commas, as in:

          H2, H4, H6 { font-style: italic }

       A comment in a configuration file starts with the characters "/*" and ends with "*/":

          @html2ps {
            seq-number: 1;  /* Automatic numbering of headings */
          }

       Notations

       Here are some definitions of terms used below:

              <b>Flag:</b>  A value of either 0 (absence, inactive etc) or 1 (presence, active etc).
              <b>Absolute</b> <b>size:</b>
                     A real number optionally followed by one of the following two-letter unit  identifiers:  cm
                     (centimeters),  mm (millimeters), in (inches), pt (points, 1pt = 1/72 inch), pc (picas, 1pc
                     = 12pt). The default unit is centimeters.
              <b>Relative</b> <b>size:</b>
                     A size relative to current fontsize. The default and currently only recognized unit is  em.
                     One  em  equals  the size of the current font.  The value should be given as a real number,
                     optionally followed by 'em', as in '0.25em'.
              <b>Whitespace:</b>
                     Any one of the characters: space, tab, newline, or carriage return.

       CSS2 blocks

       All blocks, except one: the @html2ps block, coincides with a subset of the Cascading Style Sheets,  level
       2  CSS2  Specification  (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/</a>).   The  following  default  settings for html2ps
       illustrate just about everything that currently can be used from the CSS2 specification:

          BODY {
            font-family: Times;
            font-size: 11pt;
            text-align: left;
            background: white;
          }

          H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 {
            font-weight: bold;
            margin-top: 0.8em;
            margin-bottom: 0.5em;
          }
          H1 { font-size: 19pt }
          H2 { font-size: 17pt }
          H3 { font-size: 15pt }
          H4 { font-size: 13pt }
          H5 { font-size: 12pt }
          H6 { font-size: 11pt }

          P, OL, UL, DL, BLOCKQUOTE, PRE {
            margin-top: 1em;
            margin-bottom: 1em;
          }

          P {
            line-height: 1.2em;
            text-indent: 0;
          }

          OL, UL, DD { margin-left: 2em }

          TT, KBD, PRE { font-family: Courier }

          PRE { font-size: 9pt }

          BLOCKQUOTE {
            margin-left: 1em;
            margin-right: 1em;
          }

          ADDRESS {
            margin-top: 0.5em;
            margin-bottom: 0.5em;
          }

          TABLE {
            margin-top: 1.3em;
            margin-bottom: 1em;
          }

          DIV.noprint { display: none }

          DEL { text-decoration: line-through }

          A:link, HR { color: black }

          @page {
            margin-left: 2.5cm;
            margin-right: 2.5cm;
            margin-top: 3cm;
            margin-bottom: 3cm;
          }

       The program specific block <u>@html2ps</u>:

       This block is used to specify parameters that are specific to html2ps,  and  not  covered  by  CSS2.  The
       @html2ps  block has several sub-blocks and key-value pairs, these are described in this section.

       The <u>package</u> block
            This block is used to specify which program packages are installed on the system. Typically, this is
            done in the global configuration file.

            <b>PerlMagick</b>
                   A flag specifying whether the Perl module PerlMagick is installed or not. The default is 0.

            <b>ImageMagick</b>
                   A flag specifying whether the ImageMagick package is installed or not. The default is 0.

            <b>pbmplus</b>
                   A flag specifying whether the pbmplus package is installed or not. The default is 0.

            <b>netpbm</b> A flag specifying whether the netpbm package is installed or not. The default is 0.

            <b>djpeg</b>  A flag specifying whether djpeg is installed or not.  The default is 0.

            <b>Ghostscript</b>
                   A flag specifying whether Ghostscript is installed or not.  The default is 0.

            <b>TeX</b>    A flag specifying whether the TeX package is installed or not.  The default is 0.

            <b>dvips</b>  A flag specifying whether dvips is installed or not.  The default is 0.

            <b>libwww-perl</b>
                   A  flag  specifying  whether  the  Perl  module  library libwww-perl is installed or not. The
                   default is 0.

            <b>geturl</b> When neither of the Perl packages for  retrieving  remote  documents  are  available,  it  is
                   possible  to  use some other program like wget or lynx. This value should be set to a command
                   that retrieves a document with a complete MIME header, such as "wget  -s  -q  -O-"  or  "lynx
                   -source -mime_header".

            <b>check</b>  The  name of a program used for syntax checking HTML documents.  No default, a good choice is
                   weblint.

            <b>path</b>   A colon separated list of directories where the executables from the program packages are. It
                   is only necessary to include directories that are not in the PATH for a typical user.

       The <u>paper</u> block
            The paper size is defined in this block. The size can either be given as one of the recognized paper
            types or by giving explicit values for the paper height and width. As of version 1.0 beta2, one  can
            also  use  the  @page  block  in  CSS2  for  the  paper  size. The paper block is kept for backwards
            compatibility.  Also, one can only specify explicit dimensions in @page,  not  any  paper  types  by
            name.

            <b>type</b>   Paper  type, possible choices are: A0, A1, A2, A3, A4,...,A10, B0, B1,...,B10, letter, legal,
                   arche, archd, archc, archb, archa, flsa, flse, halfletter, 11x17, and  ledger  (this  set  of
                   paper types is taken from Aladdin Ghostscript). The default is A4.

            <b>height</b> An absolute size specifying the paper height.

            <b>width</b>  An absolute size specifying the paper width.

       The <u>option</u> block
            This block is used to set default values for the command line options. The key in the key-value pair
            is the option name, in either its long or short form.

            <b>twoup</b>  Two column (2-up) output. The default is one column per page.

            <b>base</b>   Use  <u>URL</u>  as  a  base to expand relative references for in-line images. This is useful if you
                   have downloaded a document to a local file.  The <u>URL</u> should then be the <u>URL</u> of  the  original
                   document.

            <b>check</b>  Check  the  syntax of the HTML file (using an external syntax checker). The default is to not
                   make a syntax check.

            <b>toc</b>    Generate a table of contents (ToC). The value should be a string consisting  of  one  of  the
                   letters 'f', 'h', or 't', optionally combined with the letter 'b':

                   <b>b</b>      The ToC will be printed first. This requires that Ghostscript is installed.
                   <b>f</b>      The ToC will be generated from the links in the converted document.
                   <b>h</b>      The  ToC  will  be generated from headings and titles in the converted documents. Note
                          that if the document author for some strange reason has chosen to use some other means
                          to represent the headings than the HTML elements H1,...,H6, you are out of luck!
                   <b>t</b>      The ToC will be generated from links having the attribute  rev=TOC  in  the  converted
                          document.

            <b>debug</b>  Generate  debugging  information.  You  should always use this option when reporting problems
                   with html2ps.

            <b>DSC</b>    Generate DSC compliant PostScript. This requires Ghostscript and can take quite some time  to
                   do. Note that a PostScript file generated with this option cannot be used as input to html2ps
                   for reformatting later.

            <b>encoding</b>
                   The  document  encoding.  Currently  recognized values are ISO-8859-1, EUC-JP, SHIFT-JIS, and
                   ISO-2022-JP (other EUC-xx encodings may also work). The default is ISO-8859-1.

            <b>rcfile</b> A colon separated list of configuration file names to use instead  of  the  default  personal
                   configuration  file  $HOME/.html2psrc.   Definitions made in one file override definitions in
                   previous files (the last file in the list has highest precedence). An empty file name (as  in
                   ':file',  'file1::file3',  or  'file:')  will  expand  to  the  default  personal  file.  The
                   environment variable HTML2PSPATH is used to specify the directories where to search for these
                   files. (Note: this is only supposed to be used on the command line, not  in  a  configuration
                   file.)

            <b>frame</b>  Draw a frame around the text on each page. The default is to not draw a frame.

            <b>grayscale</b>
                   Convert colour images to grayscale images. Note that the PostScript file will be smaller when
                   the images are converted to grayscale. The default is to generate colour images.

            <b>help</b>   Show usage information.

            <b>hyphenate</b>
                   Hyphenate the text. This requires TeX hyphenation pattern files.

            <b>scaleimage</b>
                   Scale in-line images with a factor <u>num</u>.  The default is 1.

            <b>cookie</b> Enable cookie support, using a netscape formatted cookie <u>file</u> (requires libwww-perl).

            <b>language</b>
                   Specifies  the  language  of  the  document (overrides an eventual LANG attribute of the BODY
                   element).      The     language     should     be     given     according     to      RFC1766
                   (<a href="ftp://ftp.nordu.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt">ftp://ftp.nordu.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt</a>)                and                ISO               639
                   (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm">http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm</a>).

            <b>landscape</b>
                   Generate code for printing in landscape mode. The default is portrait mode.

            <b>scalemath</b>
                   Scale mathematical formulas with a factor <u>num</u>.  The default is 1.

            <b>mainchapter</b>
                   Specifies the start number for automatic numbering of headings  (by  setting  the  seq-number
                   parameter), the default is 1.

            <b>number</b> Insert page numbers. The default is to not number the pages.

            <b>startno</b>
                   Specifies the starting page number, the default is 1.

            <b>output</b> Write the PostScript code to <u>file.</u> The default is to write to standard output.

            <b>original</b>
                   Use  PostScript  original  images if they exist. For example, if a document contains an image
                   figure.gif, and an encapsulated PostScript file named figure.ps exists in the same directory,
                   that file will be use instead. This only work for documents read as local files. Note: if the
                   PostScript file is large or contains bitmap images, this must be combined with the -D option.
                   In HTML 4.0 this can be achieved in a much better way with:

               &lt;OBJECT data="figure.ps" type="application/postscript"&gt;
                &lt;OBJECT data="figure.gif" type="image/gif"&gt;
                 &lt;PRE&gt;[Maybe some ASCII art for text browsers]&lt;/PRE&gt;
                &lt;/OBJECT&gt;
               &lt;/OBJECT&gt;

            <b>rootdir</b>
                   When a document is read from a  local  file,  this  value  specifies  a  base  directory  for
                   resolving  relative  links  starting with "/".  Typically, this should be the directory where
                   your web server's home page resides.

            <b>xref</b>   Insert cross references at every link to within the set of converted documents.

            <b>scaledoc</b>
                   Scale the entire document with a factor <u>num</u>.  The default is 1.

            <b>style</b>  This option complements/overrides definitions made in the  configuration  files.  The  <u>string</u>
                   must  follow  the  configuration  file syntax. (Note: this is only supposed to be used on the
                   command line, not in a configuration file.)

            <b>titlepage</b>
                   Generate a title page. The default is to not generate one.

            <b>text</b>   Text mode, ignore images. The default is to include the images.

            <b>underline</b>
                   Underline text that constitutes a hypertext link. The default is to not underline.

            <b>colour</b> Produce colour output for text and background, when specified.  The default is black text  on
                   white background (mnemonic: coloUr ;-).

            <b>version</b>
                   Print information about the current version of html2ps.

            <b>web</b>    Process  a web of documents by recursively retrieve and convert documents that are referenced
                   with hyperlinks. When dealing with remote documents it will of course be necessary to  impose
                   restrictions,  to avoid downloading the entire web... The value should be a string consisting
                   of one of the letters 'a', 'b', 'l', 'r', or 's', optionally combined with a  combination  of
                   the letters 'p', 'L', and a positive integer:

                   <b>a</b>      Follow all links.
                   <b>b</b>      Follow only links to within the same directory, or below, as the start document.
                   <b>l</b>      Follow only links specified with "&lt;LINK rel=NEXT&gt;" in the document.
                   <b>p</b>      Prompt  for  each  remote  document. This mode will automatically be entered after the
                          first 50 documents.
                   <b>r</b>      Follow only relative links.
                   <b>s</b>      Follow only links to within the same server as the start document.
                   <b>L</b>      With this option, the order in which the documents are processed will  be:  first  all
                          top  level documents, then the documents linked to from these etc. For example, if the
                          document A has links to B and C, and B has a link to D, the order will be A-B-C-D.  By
                          default, each document will be followed by the first document it links to etc; so  the
                          default order for the example is A-B-D-C.
                   <b>#</b>      A  positive  integer giving the number of recursive levels. The default is 4 (when the
                          option is present).

            <b>duplex</b> Generate postscript code for single or double sided printing.  No default, valid values are:

                   <b>0</b>      Single sided.
                   <b>1</b>      Double sided.
                   <b>2</b>      Double sided, opposite page reversed (tumble mode).

       The <u>margin</u> block
            This block is used to specify page margins. The left, right,  top  and  bottom  margins,  previously
            defined with this block, should now be defined using the @page construction from CSS2.

            <b>middle</b> An  absolute  size  for  the distance between the columns when printing two columns per page,
                   default is 2cm.

       The <u>xref</u> block
            At every hyperlink (to within the set of converted  documents)  it  is  possible  to  have  a  cross
            reference inserted. The <u>xref</u> block is used to control this function.

            <b>text</b>   This  defines  the cross reference text to be inserted; the symbol $N will expand to the page
                   number, default is "[p $N]".

            <b>passes</b> The number of passes used to insert the cross references.  Normally, only one  pass  is  run.
                   But  since  the  insertion of the page numbers may effect the page breaks, it might for large
                   documents with many links be necessary with more than one pass to get  the  cross  references
                   right. The default is 1.

       The <u>quote</u> block
            Language  specific  quotation  marks are defined in this block.  These quotation marks are used with
            the HTML 4.01 element Q for short quotations. Quotation marks are predefined  for  a  few  languages
            (English, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian (also Nynorsk and Bokmål), Finnish, Spanish, French, German and
            Italian). It is possible to define different quotation marks for quotes within quotes.

            A quotation mark is defined as a string, using the same encoding as the converted document (normally
            ISO-8859-1),  and/or  with  character  entities.   Note  that  quotation mark characters for several
            languages are not included in ISO-8859-1, and their corresponding character entities were  not  been
            defined prior to HTML 4.0.

            Quotation  marks for a language can be defined explicitly in a sub-block of the quote block. One can
            also identify the set of quotation marks with another previously defined language, using a key-value
            pair.  The sub-block/key name should equal the language code as defined in  ISO  639.  The  language
            sub-block can have the following key-values:

                   <b>open</b>   The quote opening character(s).
                   <b>close</b>  The quote closing character(s). If undefined, it will equal open.
                   <b>open2</b>  The  quote  opening character(s) for quotes within quotes. If undefined, it will equal
                          open.
                   <b>close2</b> The quote closing character(s) for quotes within quotes. If undefined, it  will  equal
                          close.

            Example:  English and Spanish use the same set of quotation marks - at least according to my book on
            typography. These (already known to html2ps) are defined with:

               quote {
                 en {
                   open: "&amp;ldquo;";
                   close: "&amp;rdquo;";
                   open2: "`";
                   close2: "'";
                 }
                 es: en;
               }

       The <u>toc</u> block
            When a table of contents (ToC) is generated from document headings and  titles,  the  appearance  is
            controlled by this block.

            <b>heading</b>
                   A string with HTML code specifying a heading used on the first ToC page.

            <b>level</b>  The  maximum  heading level used for building the ToC. The default is 6, which means that all
                   headings will generate ToC entries.

            <b>indent</b> The ToC entries are indented proportional to the  corresponding  heading  level.  This  value
                   specifies the size of the indentation.  The default is 1em.

       The <u>titlepage</u> block
            When a title page is generated, its appearance is controlled by this block.

            <b>content</b>
                   A  string  with  HTML  code specifying a heading used on the title page, The default is "&lt;DIV
                   align=center&gt; &lt;H1&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;$T&lt;/BIG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt; &lt;H2&gt;$[author]&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;".

            <b>margin-top</b>
                   The size of the top margin on the title page, The default is 4cm.

       The <u>font</u> block
            Currently, html2ps recognizes the fonts: Times, New-Century-Schoolbook, Helvetica, Helvetica-Narrow,
            Palatino, Avantgarde, Bookman, and Courier. To add a new font (family), choose a name (consisting of
            letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores) for the font. Then define a sub-block to the font  block,
            with the same name as the chosen font name. This block can contain two key-value pairs:

                   <b>names</b>  A string containing four PostScript font names, separated by whitespace, corresponding
                          to  the font styles normal, italic, bold, and bold-italic. If less than four names are
                          given, the first is used for the missing names. Note that PostScript  font  names  are
                          case sensitive.
                   <b>files</b>  A  string  of  four  file  names,  separated  by whitespace, for files containing font
                          definitions for the four font styles as specified above.

            Example: A font 'myfont' has its four font styles defined in local files.  To use this font  in  all
            tables in the converted documents, one can use something like:

               TABLE { font-family: myfont }

               @html2ps {
                 font {
                   myfont {
                     names: "MyFont-Roman MyFont-Italic MyFont-Bold MyFont-BoldItalic";
                     files: "/x/y/myfr.pfa /x/y/myfi.pfa /x/y/myfb.pfa /x/y/myfbi.pfa";
                   }
                 }
               }

       The <u>hyphenation</u> block
            Hyphenation pattern files for different languages are specified in sub-blocks within this block. The
            blocks names should equal the language code as defined in ISO 639. These language blocks can contain
            the following two key-values:

                   <b>file</b>   A hyphenation pattern file in TeX format for this language.
                   <b>extfile</b>
                          A  file  containing a list of hyphenation exceptions for this language.  The exception
                          file should contain words, separated  by  whitespaces,  with  hyphens  inserted  where
                          hyphenation is allowed, as in: "in-fra-struc-ture white-space".

            For example, for English (with language code 'en') one can have a block like:

                   en {
                     file: "/opt/tex/lib/macros/hyphen.tex";
                     extfile: "/opt/tdb/lib/html2ps/enhyphext";
                   }

            The hyphenation block itself can furthermore have these key-values:

            <b>min</b>    A  positive  integer  defining the minimum number of letters a word must contain to make it a
                   candidate for hyphenation.  The default is 8.

            <b>start</b>  A positive integer defining the minimum number of letters that must precede the hyphen when a
                   word is hyphenated.  The default is 4.

            <b>end</b>    A positive integer defining the minimum number of letters that must follow the hyphen when  a
                   word is hyphenated.  The default is 3.

       The <u>header</u> block
            This  block  is  used  to  specify  page  headers.  It is possible to define left, center, and right

              routine. The default is "%e %b %Y  %R", which gives a date string like " 7 May 2010  13:22".

       <b>locale</b> The  locale  (language  code)  used  for  formating  language  dependent parts of the date/time in
              datefmt. If unspecified, the value is taken  from  environment  variables,  see  <a href="../man3/setlocale.3.html">setlocale</a>(3).  No
              default.

       <b>doc-sep</b>

              link. The default is 0.

       <b>seq-number</b>
              When this flag is set, the headings in the document will be  sequentially  numbered:  H1  headings
              will  be  numbered  1, 2,..., H2 headings 1.1, 1.2, etc. The starting number for H1 can be changed
              using the -M (--mainchapter) option. The default is 0.

       <b>extrapage</b>
              A flag specifying whether an extra (empty) page should be printed, when necessary, to ensure  that
              the  title  page,  the table of contents, and the document itself will start on odd pages. This is
              typically desirable for double sided printing. The default is 1.

       <b>break-table</b>
              A flag specifying if a table should be broken across two pages when it does not fit on the current
              page, but it does on a page of its own.  The default is 0 (avoid breaking tables when possible).

       <b>forms</b>  This flag is used to specify whether FORM elements in the document should be processed or ignored.
              Some forms may be suitable for printing out and be filled out (with a pen), others  are  not.  The
              default is 1.

       <b>textarea-data</b>
              When  a  TEXTAREA element contains prefilled data, the text will be used as labels if this flag is
              set, otherwise ignored. The default is 0.

       <b>page-break</b>
              Set this flag to 0 to suppress the normal behavior of generating  page  breaks  from  the  comment
              &lt;!--NewPage--&gt; etc, as specified below. The default is 1.

       <b>expand-acronyms</b>
              A  flag  specifying whether acronyms, given by the ACRONYM element, should be expanded or not. The
              default is 0.

       <b>spoof</b>  Some web servers return different documents depending on which user agent is used to retrieve  the
              document. You can fool the web server that a certain browser is used, by setting this value to the
              identification used by the browser, such as "Mozilla/4.0". This only works if you are using one of
              the Perl packages to retrieve remote documents.

       <b>ssi</b>    When  this flag is set, some Server Side Includes will be processed when the document is read from
              a local file. Examples are &lt;!--#include  file=...&gt;,  &lt;!--#echo  var="LAST_MODIFIED"&gt;,  &lt;!--#config
              timefmt=...&gt;. The default is 0.

       <b>prefilled</b>
              This  flag  controls whether the content of form elements should be rendered or not. That is, when
              this flag is set, the content of TEXTAREA elements, and the value of the value attribute  of  text
              INPUT  elements  will  be  shown.  Also, checked radio buttons and checkboxes will be marked.  The
              default is 0.

</pre><h4><b>SYMBOLS</b></h4><pre>
       The following symbols can be used on the title page, the page headers/footers, and in the heading for the
       table of contents:

       Symbols of the form "$[<u>name</u>]" will expand to the value of the content attribute of META elements,  having
       either  of  the  attributes  "name=<u>name</u>"  or  "http-equiv=<u>name</u>"  (case insensitive string matching).  For
       example, when a document containing:

          &lt;META name="expires" content="31 Dec 2011"&gt;

       is converted, using a configuration file with:

          footer { left: "Expires: $[expires]" }

       this left footer will be inserted:

          Expires: 31 Dec 2011

       In addition, these symbols are defined:

              <b>$T</b>     Current document title.
              <b>$A</b>     Author of current document, as specified with &lt;META  name="Author"  content="..."&gt;  in  the
                     document head.
              <b>$U</b>     The URL, or file name, of current document.
              <b>$N</b>     Page number.
              <b>$H</b>     Current document heading (level 1-3).
              <b>$D</b>     Current date/time. The format is given by the datefmt key.

       So $A is equivalent to $[author], but kept for backwards compatibility.

       To avoid symbol expansion, precede the dollar sign with a backslash, as in "\$T".

       I imagine that a typical use of configuration files can be something along the following lines.

       System specific definitions (e.g. specification of available program packages) and global defaults (paper
       type etc) are defined in the global configuration file.

       If  there  is  more  than  one  user  of  the  program  on the system, each user can also have a personal
       configuration file with his/hers own personal preferences.  (On a single user  system  one  can  use  the
       global configuration file for this purpose as well.)

       One  may  also develop a collection of configuration files for typical situations. These files are placed
       in a directory that is searched by html2ps (the search path is  defined  with  the  environment  variable
       HTML2PSPATH).   For  example,  to  print  a  document  as  slides - in landscape mode, with large text in
       Helvetica, and a thick frame - one can create a configuration file, called 'slides' say, containing:

          @html2ps {
            option {
              landscape: 1;
              frame: 1;
            }
            frame { width: 3pt }
          }
          BODY {
            font-family: Helvetica;
            font-size: 20pt;
          }
          H1 { font-size: 35pt }
          H2 { font-size: 32pt }
          H3 { font-size: 29pt }
          H4 { font-size: 26pt }
          H5 { font-size: 23pt }
          H6 { font-size: 20pt }
          PRE { font-size: 18pt }

       Then use the command:

          html2ps -f slides ...

       to convert the document. Note that with this command the file 'slides' is used instead  of  the  personal
       configuration  file.  If  you  want  both  to  be used, giving precedence to definitions made in the file
       'slides', use the command:

          html2ps -f :slides ...

       (The page breaks between the slides can for example be generated by adding '&lt;HR class=PAGE-BREAK&gt;' to the
       HTML document.)

       For features that are frequently turned on and off,  and  that  cannot  be  controlled  by  command  line
       options,  it  may  be a good idea to create small configuration files as "building blocks". For example a
       file 'A4' for printing on A4 paper (if you have some other default paper type):

          @html2ps { paper { type: A4 } }

       and a file 'hnum' for automatic numbering of headings:

          @html2ps { seq-number: 1 }

       Combining this with the previous example: to convert a document for printing on A4 sized slides with  all
       headings numbered, use the command:

          html2ps -f :slides:A4:hnum ...
