</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dhcp6s.conf — DHCPv6 server configuration file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/wide-dhcpv6/dhcp6s.conf</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>dhcp6s.conf</b>  file  contains  configuration  information  for  KAME's  DHCPv6  server,  <b>dhcp6s</b>.   The
       configuration file consists of a sequence of statements terminated by a semi-colon (`;').  Statements are
       composed of tokens separated by white space, which can be any combination of blanks, tabs  and  newlines.
       In  some  cases  a  set  of statements is combined with a pair of brackets, which is regarded as a single
       token.  Lines beginning with ‘#’ are comments.

</pre><h4><b>Interface</b> <b>specification</b></h4><pre>
       There are some statements that may or have to specify interface.  Interfaces are specified in the form of
       "name unit", such as <u>fxp0</u> and <u>gif1.</u>

</pre><h4><b>Include</b> <b>statement</b></h4><pre>
       An include statement specifies another configuration file to be  included.   The  format  of  an  include
       statement is as follows:
       <b>include</b> <u>"filename"</u>;
               Where <u>"filename"</u> is the name (full path) of the file to be included.

</pre><h4><b>Option</b> <b>statement</b></h4><pre>
       An  option  statement  specifies  configuration  parameters provided for every client.  The format of the
       statement is as follows.
       <b>option</b> <u>option-name</u> [<u>option-value</u>] ;
               The following options can be specified in an option statement.
               <b>domain-name-servers</b> <u>dns-address</u> [<u>dns-addresses...</u>];
                       provides DNS server address(es).  Each  <u>dns-address</u>  must  be  a  numeric  IPv6  address.
                       Multiple server addresses can also be specified by a sequence of these statements.
               <b>domain-name</b> <u>"dns-name"</u>;
                       provides a domain name of a DNS search path.  Multiple names in the path can be specified
                       by a sequence of these statements.
               <b>ntp-servers</b> <u>ntp-address</u> [<u>ntp-addresses...</u>];
                       provides  NTP  server  address(es).   Each  <u>ntp-address</u>  must  be a numeric IPv6 address.
                       Multiple server addresses can also be specified by a sequence of these statements.

                       provides a domain name of a SIP server.  Multiple names in the path can be specified by a
                       sequence of these statements.
               <b>nis-server-address</b> <u>nis-server-address</u> [<u>nis-server-addresses...</u>];
                       provides NIS server address(es).  Each <u>nis-server-address</u> must be a numeric IPv6 address.
                       Multiple server addresses can also be specified by a sequence of these statements.
               <b>nis-domain-name</b> <u>"nis-domain-name"</u>;
                       provides a NIS domain name.  Multiple names in the path can be specified by a sequence of
                       these statements.
               <b>nisp-server-address</b> <u>nisp-server-address</u> [<u>nisp-server-addresses...</u>];
                       provides NIS+ server address(es).   Each  <u>nisp-server-address</u>  must  be  a  numeric  IPv6
                       address.   Multiple  server  addresses  can  also  be  specified  by  a sequence of these

               <b>refreshtime</b> <u>interval</u>;
                       specifies  the  refresh time of stateless information that does not have particular lease
                       duration in seconds.  This option  is  only  applicable  to  stateless  configuration  by
                       information-request and reply exchanges.

</pre><h4><b>Interface</b> <b>statement</b></h4><pre>
       An  interface  statement  specifies  configuration parameters on the interface.  The generic format of an
       interface statement is as follows:
       <b>interface</b> <u>interface</u> { <u>substatements</u> };
               The followings are possible <u>substatements</u> in an interface statement.
               <b>allow</b> <u>allow-options</u> ;
                       This  statement  specifies  DHCPv6  options  accepted  by  the  server.   Currently  only
                       <u>rapid-commit</u> can be specified in an <b>allow</b> statement, which specifies the server to accept
                       a rapid-commit option in solicit messages.
               <b>preference</b> <u>pref</u>;
                       This  statement  sets  the  server's preference value on the interface to the value <u>pref</u>.
                       The specified value will be contained in a preference option of advertise messages.   The
                       preference value must be a decimal integer and be between 0 and 255 (inclusive.)
               <b>address-pool</b> <u>pool</u> <u>pltime</u> [<u>vltime</u>];
                       This statement assigns an address pool <u>pool</u> to the interface. When <b>dhcp6s.conf</b> receives a
                       allocation  request  for  an  IA-NA,  it  assigns  one  IPv6 address from this pool.  The
                       specified pool name will be defined in a pool statement.  Regarding the <u>pltime</u> and <u>vltime</u>
                       , please see the explanation in the <u>prefix</u> substatement in host statement section.

</pre><h4><b>Host</b> <b>statement</b></h4><pre>
       A host statement specifies configuration parameters for a particular client.  The  generic  format  of  a
       host statement is as follows:
       <b>host</b> <u>name</u> { <u>substatements</u> };
               <u>name</u>  is  an  arbitrary  string.   It  does  not  affect  server's  behavior  but is provided for
               readability of log messages.  Possible substatements are as follows.
               <b>duid</b> <u>ID</u>;
                       This statement defines the client's DHCP  unique  identifier  (DUID).   <u>ID</u>  is  a  colon-
                       separated  hexadecimal  sequence  where  each  separated  part  must  be  composed of two
                       hexadecimal values.  This statement is used to identify a particular host by  the  server
                       and must be included in a host statement.
               <b>prefix</b> <u>ipv6-prefix</u> <u>pltime</u> [<u>vltime</u>];
                       This  statement specifies an IPv6 prefix to be delegated to the client.  <u>ipv6-prefix</u> is a
                       string representing a valid IPv6 prefix (see the example below).  <u>pltime</u> and  <u>vltime</u>  are
                       preferred  and  valid lifetimes of the prefix, respectively.  When the latter is omitted,
                       it will be set to the same value of <u>pltime.</u> A positive decimal number or a special string
                       <b>infinity</b> can be specified as a lifetime.  A  decimal  number  provides  the  lifetime  in
                       seconds,  while  <b>infinity</b>  means  the  corresponding  lifetime  never expires.  When both
                       lifetimes are specified, <u>pltime</u> must not be larger than <u>vltime</u>.  Multiple prefixes can be
                       specified, each of which is given by a single <b>prefix</b> statement.  In  that  case,  all  or
                       some  of  the  specified  prefixes  will  be  delegated  to the client, based on required
                       parameters by the client.
               <b>address</b> <u>ipv6-address</u> <u>pltime</u> [<u>vltime</u>];
                       This statement specifies an IPv6 address to be assigned to  the  client.   Everything  is
                       same as <u>prefix</u> option, except that you do not need specify prefix length.
               <b>delayedkey</b> <u>keyname</u>;
                       This  statement  specifies  a  secret  key  shared with the client for the DHCPv6 delayed
                       authentication protocol.  <u>keyname</u> is a string that identifies a  particular  set  of  key
                       parameters.    A  separate  <b>keyinfo</b>  statement  for  <u>keyname</u>  must  be  provided  in  the
                       configuration file.  When  this  statement  is  specified  and  the  client  includes  an
                       authentication  option  for  the  delayed  authentication  protocol in a Solicit message,
                       <b>dhcp6s</b> will perform the authentication protocol for succeeding message exchanges.

</pre><h4><b>Pool</b> <b>statement</b></h4><pre>
       A pool statement specifies an address pool for a particular interface.  The  generic  format  of  a  pool
       statement is as follows:
       <b>pool</b> <u>name</u> { <u>substatements</u>; };
               <u>name</u>  is  an  arbitrary  string.   It  does  not  affect  server's  behavior  but is provided for
               readability of log messages.  Possible substatements are as follows.
               <b>range</b> <u>min-addr</u> <b>to</b> <u>max-addr</u>
                       This substatement defines the range of  addresses  allocated  for  the  pool,  i.e.  from
                       <u>min-addr</u> to <u>max-addr.</u>

</pre><h4><b>Keyinfo</b> <b>statement</b></h4><pre>
       This statement defines a secret key shared with a client to authenticate DHCPv6 messages.  The format and
       the  description of this statement is provided in <u><a href="../man5/dhcp6c.conf.5.html">dhcp6c.conf</a></u>(5).  One important difference in the server
       configuration is, however, the <u>keyname</u> is referred from a <b>host</b> statement as described above.

</pre><h4><b>Examples</b></h4><pre>
       The followings are a sample configuration to provide a DNS server address for every client as well as  to
       delegate a permanent IPv6 prefix 2001:db8:1111::/48 to a client whose DUID is 00:01:00:01:aa:bb.

       option domain-name-servers 2001:db8::35;

       host kame {
               duid 00:01:00:01:aa:bb;
               prefix 2001:db8:1111::/48 infinity;
       };

       If  a  shared secret should be configured in both the server and the client for DHCPv6 authentication, it
       would be specified in the configuration file as follows:

       keyinfo kame {
               realm "kame.net";
               keyid 1;
               secret "5pvW2g48OHPvkYMJSw0vZA==";
       };

       And the <b>host</b> statement would be modified as follows:

       host kame {
               duid 00:01:00:01:aa:bb;
               prefix 2001:db8:1111::/48 infinity;
               delayedkey kame;
       };
