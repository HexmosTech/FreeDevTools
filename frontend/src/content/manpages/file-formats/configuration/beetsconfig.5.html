       beetsconfig - beets configuration file

       Beets has an extensive configuration system that lets you customize nearly every aspect of its operation.
       To  configure  beets,  you  create  a  file  called <b>config.yaml</b>. The location of the file depends on your
       platform (type <b>beet</b> <b>config</b> <b>-p</b> to see the path on your system):

       • On Unix-like OSes, write <b><a href="file:~/.config/beets/config.yaml">~/.config/beets/config.yaml</a></b>.

       • On   Windows,   use   <b>%APPDATA%\beets\config.yaml</b>.   This   is   usually   in    a    directory    like
         <b>C:\Users\You\AppData\Roaming</b>.

       • On OS X, you can use either the Unix location or <b><a href="file:~/Library/Application">~/Library/Application</a></b> <b>Support/beets/config.yaml</b>.

       You can launch your text editor to create or update your configuration by typing <b>beet</b> <b>config</b> <b>-e</b>. (See the
       <u>config</u>  command for details.) It is also possible to customize the location of the configuration file and
       even use multiple layers of configuration. See <u>Configuration</u> <u>Location</u>, below.

       The config file uses <u>YAML</u> syntax. You can use the full power of YAML, but most configuration options  are
       simple key/value pairs. This means your config file will look like this:

          option: value
          another_option: foo
          bigger_option:
              key: value
              foo: bar

       In  YAML,  you will need to use spaces (not tabs!) to indent some lines. If you have questions about more
       sophisticated syntax, take a look at the <u>YAML</u> documentation.

       The rest of this page enumerates the dizzying litany of configuration options  available  in  beets.  You
       might also want to see an <u>example</u>.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These options control beets’ global operation.

   <b>library</b>
       Path  to  the  beets  library  file.  By  default, beets will use a file called <b>library.db</b> alongside your
       configuration file.

   <b>directory</b>
       The directory to which files will be copied/moved when adding them to the library. Defaults to  a  folder
       called <b>Music</b> in your home directory.

   <b>plugins</b>
       A space-separated list of plugin module names to load. See <u>Using</u> <u>Plugins</u>.

   <b>include</b>
       A  space-separated list of extra configuration files to include.  Filenames are relative to the directory
       containing <b>config.yaml</b>.

   <b>pluginpath</b>
       Directories to search for plugins.  Each Python file or directory in a plugin path  represents  a  plugin
       and  should  define a subclass of <b>BeetsPlugin</b>.  A plugin can then be loaded by adding the filename to the
       <u>plugins</u> configuration.  The plugin path can either be a single string or a list  of  strings—so,  if  you
       have multiple paths, format them as a YAML list like so:

          pluginpath:
              - /path/one
              - /path/two

   <b>ignore</b>
       A  list  of  glob  patterns specifying file and directory names to be ignored when importing. By default,
       this consists of <b>.*</b>,  <b>*~</b>,  <b>System</b> <b>Volume</b> <b>Information</b>, <b>lost+found</b> (i.e., beets ignores  Unix-style  hidden
       files, backup files, and directories that appears at the root of some Linux and Windows filesystems).

   <b>ignore_hidden</b>
       Either  <b>yes</b>  or  <b>no</b>;  whether to ignore hidden files when importing. On Windows, the “Hidden” property of
       files is used to detect whether or not a file is hidden. On OS X, the file’s “IsHidden” flag is  used  to
       detect  whether or not a file is hidden. On both OS X and other platforms (excluding Windows), files (and
       directories) starting with a dot are detected as hidden files.

   <b>replace</b>
       A set of regular expression/replacement pairs to be applied to all filenames created by beets. Typically,
       these replacements are used to avoid confusing problems or  errors  with  the  filesystem  (for  example,
       leading  dots,  which  hide  files  on  Unix,  and  trailing whitespace, which is illegal on Windows). To
       override these substitutions, specify a mapping from  regular  expression  to  replacement  strings.  For
       example, <b>[xy]:</b> <b>z</b> will make beets replace all instances of the characters <b>x</b> or <b>y</b> with the character <b>z</b>.

       If  you  do change this value, be certain that you include at least enough substitutions to avoid causing
       errors on your operating system. Here are the default substitutions used by beets, which  are  sufficient
       to avoid unexpected behavior on all popular platforms:

          replace:
              '[\\/]': _
              '^\.': _
              '[\x00-\x1f]': _
              '[&lt;&gt;:"\?\*\|]': _
              '\.$': _
              '\s+$': ''
              '^\s+': ''
              '^-': _

       These substitutions remove forward and back slashes, leading dots, and control characters—all of which is
       a good idea on any OS. The fourth line removes the Windows “reserved characters” (useful even on Unix for
       compatibility  with  Windows-influenced  network  filesystems  like  Samba).   Trailing dots and trailing
       whitespace, which can cause problems on Windows clients, are also removed.

       When replacements other than the defaults are used, it is possible that they will increase the length  of
       the  path.  In  the scenario where this leads to a conflict with the maximum filename length, the default
       replacements will be used to resolve the conflict and beets will display a warning.

       Note  that  paths  might  contain  special  characters  such  as  typographical  quotes  (<b>“”</b>).  With  the
       configuration  above,  those  will  not be replaced as they don’t match the typewriter quote (<b>"</b>). To also
       strip these special characters, you can either add them to the replacement list or use the  <u>asciify_paths</u>
       configuration option below.

   <b>path_sep_replace</b>
       A  string  that replaces the path separator (for example, the forward slash <b>/</b> on Linux and MacOS, and the
       backward slash <b>\\</b> on Windows) when generating filenames with beets.  This option is related  to  <u>replace</u>,
       but is distinct from it for technical reasons.

       <b>WARNING:</b>
          Changing  this  option  is potentially dangerous. For example, setting it to the actual path separator
          could create directories in unexpected locations. Use caution when changing it and always try  it  out
          on a small number of files before applying it to your whole library.

       Default: <b>_</b>.

   <b>asciify_paths</b>
       Convert all non-ASCII characters in paths to ASCII equivalents.

       For  example,  if  your  path  template  for  singletons is <b>singletons/$title</b> and the title of a track is
       “Café”, then the track will be saved as <b>singletons/Cafe.mp3</b>.  The changes take place before applying  the
       <u>replace</u>  configuration  and  are roughly equivalent to wrapping all your path templates in the <b>%asciify{}</b>
       <u>template</u> <u>function</u>.

       This uses the <u>unidecode</u> <u>module</u> which is language agnostic, so some characters may be transliterated  from
       a different language than expected.  For example, Japanese kanji will usually use their Chinese readings.

       Default: <b>no</b>.

   <b>art_filename</b>
       When  importing  album  art, the name of the file (without extension) where the cover art image should be
       placed. This is a template string, so you can use any of the syntax available to <u>Path</u>  <u>Formats</u>.  Defaults
       to <b>cover</b> (i.e., images will be named <b>cover.jpg</b> or <b>cover.png</b> and placed in the album’s directory).

   <b>threaded</b>
       Either  <b>yes</b>  or  <b>no</b>,  indicating  whether  the  autotagger should use multiple threads. This makes things
       substantially faster by overlapping work: for example, it can copy files for one album in  parallel  with
       looking  up  data  in  MusicBrainz  for  a  different  album. You may want to disable this when debugging
       problems with the autotagger.  Defaults to <b>yes</b>.

   <b>format_item</b>
       Format to use when listing <u>individual</u> <u>items</u> with the <u>list</u> command and other commands that need  to  print
       out items. Defaults to <b>$artist</b> <b>-</b> <b>$album</b> <b>-</b> <b>$title</b>. The <b>-f</b> command-line option overrides this setting.

       It used to be named <u>list_format_item</u>.

   <b>format_album</b>
       Format to use when listing <u>albums</u> with <u>list</u> and other commands. Defaults to <b>$albumartist</b> <b>-</b> <b>$album</b>. The <b>-f</b>
       command-line option overrides this setting.

       It used to be named <u>list_format_album</u>.

   <b>sort_item</b>
       Default sort order to use when fetching items from the database. Defaults to <b>artist+</b> <b>album+</b> <b>disc+</b> <b>track+</b>.
       Explicit sort orders override this default.

   <b>sort_album</b>
       Default  sort  order  to  use  when  fetching  albums from the database. Defaults to <b>albumartist+</b> <b>album+</b>.
       Explicit sort orders override this default.

   <b>sort_case_insensitive</b>
       Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, indicating whether the case should be ignored when sorting lexicographic  fields.  When
       set  to <b>no</b>, lower-case values will be placed after upper-case values (e.g., <u>Bar</u> <u>Qux</u> <u>foo</u>), while <b>yes</b> would
       result in the more expected <u>Bar</u> <u>foo</u> <u>Qux</u>. Default: <b>yes</b>.

   <b>original_date</b>
       Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, indicating whether matched albums should have their <b>year</b>, <b>month</b>, and <b>day</b> fields set  to
       the  release  date  of  the <u>original</u> version of an album rather than the selected version of the release.
       That is, if this option is turned on, then <b>year</b> will always equal <b>original_year</b> and so on. Default: <b>no</b>.

   <b>overwrite_null</b>
       This confusingly-named option indicates which fields have meaningful <u>null</u> values.  If an album  or  track
       field  is in the corresponding list, then an existing value for this field in an item in the database can
       be overwritten with <u>null</u>.  By default, however, <u>null</u> is interpreted as information about the field  being
       unavailable, so it would not overwrite existing values.  For example:

          overwrite_null:
              album: ["albumid"]
              track: ["title", "date"]

   <b>artist_credit</b>
       Either  <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, indicating whether matched tracks and albums should use the artist credit, rather than
       the artist. That is, if this option is turned on, then <b>artist</b> will contain the artist as credited on  the
       release.

   <b>per_disc_numbering</b>
       A  boolean  controlling the track numbering style on multi-disc releases. By default (<b>per_disc_numbering:</b>
       <b>no</b>), tracks are numbered per-release, so the first track on the second disc has track number N+1 where  N
       is  the  number  of  tracks  on  the  first  disc.  If this <b>per_disc_numbering</b> is enabled, then the first
       (non-pregap) track on each disc always has track number 1.

       If you enable <b>per_disc_numbering</b>, you will likely want to change your <u>Path</u> <u>Format</u> <u>Configuration</u>  also  to
       include <b>$disc</b> before <b>$track</b> to make filenames sort correctly in album directories. For example, you might
       want to use a path format like this:

          paths:
              default: $albumartist/$album%aunique{}/$disc-$track $title

       When  this  option  is off (the default), even “pregap” hidden tracks are numbered from one, not zero, so
       other track numbers may appear to be bumped up by one. When it is on, the pregap track for each disc  can
       be numbered zero.

   <b>aunique</b>
       These  options  are  used  to  generate  a string that is guaranteed to be unique among all albums in the
       library who share the same set of keys.

       The defaults look like this:

          aunique:
              keys: albumartist album
              disambiguators: albumtype year label catalognum albumdisambig releasegroupdisambig
              bracket: '[]'

       See <u>Album</u> <u>Disambiguation</u> for more details.

   <b>sunique</b>
       Like <u>aunique</u> above for albums, these options control the generation of a unique  string  to  disambiguate
       <u>singletons</u> that share similar metadata.

       The defaults look like this:

          sunique:
              keys: artist title
              disambiguators: year trackdisambig
              bracket: '[]'

       See <u>Singleton</u> <u>Disambiguation</u> for more details.

   <b>terminal_encoding</b>
       The text encoding, as <u>known</u> <u>to</u> <u>Python</u>, to use for messages printed to the standard output. It’s also used
       to  read  messages from the standard input.  By default, this is determined automatically from the locale
       environment variables.

   <b>clutter</b>
       When beets imports all the files in a directory, it tries to  remove  the  directory  if  it’s  empty.  A
       directory  is  considered empty if it only contains files whose names match the glob patterns in <u>clutter</u>,
       which should be a list of strings. The default list consists of “Thumbs.DB” and “.DS_Store”.

       The importer only removes recursively searched subdirectories—the top-level directory you specify on  the
       command line is never deleted.

   <b>max_filename_length</b>
       Set  the  maximum  number  of  characters in a filename, after which names will be truncated. By default,
       beets tries to ask the filesystem for the correct maximum.

   <b>id3v23</b>
       By default, beets writes MP3 tags using the ID3v2.4 standard, the latest  version  of  ID3.  Enable  this
       option  to  instead  use the older ID3v2.3 standard, which is preferred by certain older software such as
       Windows Media Player.

   <b>va_name</b>
       Sets the albumartist for various-artist compilations. Defaults  to  <b>'Various</b>  <b>Artists'</b>  (the  MusicBrainz
       standard). Affects other sources, such as <u>Discogs</u> <u>Plugin</u>, too.

</pre><h4><b>UI</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options that allow for customization of the visual appearance of the console interface.

       These options are available in this section:

   <b>color</b>
       Either  <b>yes</b>  or  <b>no</b>;  whether to use color in console output (currently only in the <b>import</b> command). Turn
       this off if your terminal doesn’t support ANSI colors.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The <u>color</u> option was previously a top-level configuration. This is still respected, but a  deprecation
          message will be shown until your top-level <u>color</u> configuration has been nested under <u>ui</u>.

   <b>colors</b>
       The colors that are used throughout the user interface. These are only used if the <b>color</b> option is set to
       <b>yes</b>. For example, you might have a section in your configuration file that looks like this:

          ui:
              colors:
                  text_success: ['bold', 'green']
                  text_warning: ['bold', 'yellow']
                  text_error: ['bold', 'red']
                  text_highlight: ['bold', 'red']
                  text_highlight_minor: ['white']
                  action_default: ['bold', 'cyan']
                  action: ['bold', 'cyan']
                  # New colors after UI overhaul
                  text: ['normal']
                  text_faint: ['faint']
                  import_path: ['bold', 'blue']
                  import_path_items: ['bold', 'blue']
                  added:   ['green']
                  removed: ['red']
                  changed: ['yellow']
                  added_highlight:   ['bold', 'green']
                  removed_highlight: ['bold', 'red']
                  changed_highlight: ['bold', 'yellow']
                  text_diff_added:   ['bold', 'red']
                  text_diff_removed: ['bold', 'red']
                  text_diff_changed: ['bold', 'red']
                  action_description: ['white']

       Available  colors:  black,  darkred,  darkgreen, brown (darkyellow), darkblue, purple (darkmagenta), teal
       (darkcyan), lightgray, darkgray, red, green, yellow, blue, fuchsia (magenta), turquoise (cyan), white

       Legacy UI colors config directive used strings. If any colors value is still a string instead of a  list,
       it will be translated to list automatically. For example <b>blue</b> will become <b>['blue']</b>.

   <b>terminal_width</b>
       Controls  line  wrapping  on  non-Unix  systems.  On  Unix systems, the width of the terminal is detected
       automatically. If this fails, or on non-Unix systems, the specified value is used as a fallback. Defaults
       to <b>80</b> characters:

          ui:
              terminal_width: 80

   <b>length_diff_thresh</b>
       Beets compares the length of the imported track with the length the  metadata  source  provides.  If  any
       tracks  differ  by  at  least <b>length_diff_thresh</b> seconds, they will be colored with <b>text_highlight</b>. Below
       this threshold, different track lengths are colored with <b>text_highlight_minor</b>.   <b>length_diff_thresh</b>  does
       not  impact  which  releases  are  selected  in  autotagger  matching  or distance score calculation (see
       <u>Autotagger</u> <u>Matching</u> <u>Options</u>, <b>distance_weights</b> and <u>colors</u>):

          ui:
              length_diff_thresh: 10.0

   <b>import</b>
       When importing, beets will read several options to configure the visuals of the  import  dialogue.  There
       are two layouts controlling how horizontal space and line wrapping is dealt with: <b>column</b> and <b>newline</b>. The
       indentation  of  the  respective  elements of the import UI can also be configured. For example setting <b>4</b>
       for <b>match_header</b> will indent the very first block of a proposed match by five characters in the terminal:

          ui:
              import:
                  indentation:
                      match_header: 4
                      match_details: 4
                      match_tracklist: 7
                  layout: newline

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options that control the <u>import</u> command are indented under the <b>import:</b> key. For  example,  you  might
       have a section in your configuration file that looks like this:

          import:
              write: yes
              copy: yes
              resume: no

       These options are available in this section:

   <b>write</b>
       Either  <b>yes</b>  or  <b>no</b>,  controlling  whether metadata (e.g., ID3) tags are written to files when using <b>beet</b>
       <b>import</b>. Defaults to <b>yes</b>. The <b>-w</b> and <b>-W</b> command-line options override this setting.

   <b>copy</b>
       Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, indicating whether to <b>copy</b> files into the library directory  when  using  <b>beet</b>  <b>import</b>.
       Defaults to <b>yes</b>.  Can be overridden with the <b>-c</b> and <b>-C</b> command-line options.

       The option is ignored if <b>move</b> is enabled (i.e., beets can move or copy files but it doesn’t make sense to
       do both).

   <b>move</b>
       Either  <b>yes</b>  or  <b>no</b>,  indicating whether to <b>move</b> files into the library directory when using <b>beet</b> <b>import</b>.
       Defaults to <b>no</b>.

       The effect is similar to the <b>copy</b> option but you end  up  with  only  one  copy  of  the  imported  file.
       (“Moving”  works  even  across  filesystems;  if necessary, beets will copy and then delete when a simple
       rename is impossible.) Moving files can be risky—it’s a good idea to keep a backup in case beets  doesn’t
       do what you expect with your files.

       This  option  <u>overrides</u>  <b>copy</b>, so enabling it will always move (and not copy) files. The <b>-c</b> switch to the
       <b>beet</b> <b>import</b> command, however, still takes precedence.

   <b>link</b>
       Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, indicating whether to use symbolic links  instead  of  moving  or  copying  files.  (It
       conflicts with the <b>move</b>, <b>copy</b> and <b>hardlink</b> options.) Defaults to <b>no</b>.

       This option only works on platforms that support symbolic links: i.e., Unixes.  It will fail on Windows.

       It’s  likely  that you’ll also want to set <b>write</b> to <b>no</b> if you use this option to preserve the metadata on
       the linked files.

   <b>hardlink</b>
       Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, indicating whether to use hard links instead of moving, copying, or  symlinking  files.
       (It conflicts with the <b>move</b>, <b>copy</b>, and <b>link</b> options.) Defaults to <b>no</b>.

       As with symbolic links (see <u>link</u>, above), this will not work on Windows and you will want to set <b>write</b> to
       <b>no</b>.  Otherwise, metadata on the original file will be modified.

   <b>reflink</b>
       Either  <b>yes</b>, <b>no</b>, or <b>auto</b>, indicating whether to use copy-on-write <u>file</u> <u>clones</u> (a.k.a. “reflinks”) instead
       of copying or moving files.  The <b>auto</b> option uses reflinks when possible and falls back to plain  copying
       when necessary.  Defaults to <b>no</b>.

       This  kind  of  clone  is  only  available  on certain filesystems: for example, btrfs and APFS. For more
       details on filesystem support, see the <u>pyreflink</u> documentation. Note that you need to install  <b>pyreflink</b>,
       either through <b>python</b> <b>-m</b> <b>pip</b> <b>install</b> <b>beets[reflink]</b> or <b>python</b> <b>-m</b> <b>pip</b> <b>install</b> <b>reflink</b>.

       The option is ignored if <b>move</b> is enabled (i.e., beets can move or copy files but it doesn’t make sense to
       do both).

   <b>resume</b>
       Either  <b>yes</b>, <b>no</b>, or <b>ask</b>. Controls whether interrupted imports should be resumed. “Yes” means that imports
       are always resumed when possible; “no” means resuming is disabled entirely;  “ask”  (the  default)  means
       that  the  user should be prompted when resuming is possible. The <b>-p</b> and <b>-P</b> flags correspond to the “yes”
       and “no” settings and override this option.

   <b>incremental</b>
       Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, controlling whether imported  directories  are  recorded  and  whether  these  recorded
       directories are skipped.  This corresponds to the <b>-i</b> flag to <b>beet</b> <b>import</b>.

   <b>incremental_skip_later</b>
       Either  <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, controlling whether skipped directories are recorded in the incremental list. When set
       to <b>yes</b>, skipped directories won’t be recorded, and beets will try to import them again later. When set to
       <b>no</b>, skipped directories will be recorded, and skipped later. Defaults to <b>no</b>.

   <b>from_scratch</b>
       Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (default), controlling whether existing metadata is discarded when a match  is  applied.
       This corresponds to the <b>--from-scratch</b> flag to <b>beet</b> <b>import</b>.

   <b>quiet</b>
       Either  <b>yes</b>  or  <b>no</b>  (default),  controlling  whether to ask for a manual decision from the user when the
       importer is unsure how to proceed. This corresponds to the <b>--quiet</b> flag to <b>beet</b> <b>import</b>.

   <b>quiet_fallback</b>
       Either <b>skip</b> (default) or <b>asis</b>, specifying what should happen in quiet mode (see the <b>-q</b>  flag  to  <b>import</b>,
       above) when there is no strong recommendation.

   <b>none_rec_action</b>
       Either  <b>ask</b>  (default),  <b>asis</b>  or <b>skip</b>. Specifies what should happen during an interactive import session
       when there is no recommendation. Useful when you are only interested  in  processing  medium  and  strong
       recommendations interactively.

   <b>timid</b>
       Either  <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, controlling whether the importer runs in <u>timid</u> mode, in which it asks for confirmation
       on every autotagging match, even the ones that seem very close. Defaults to <b>no</b>. The <b>-t</b> command-line  flag
       controls the same setting.

   <b>log</b>
       Specifies a filename where the importer’s log should be kept.  By default, no log is written. This can be
       overridden with the <b>-l</b> flag to <b>import</b>.

   <b>default_action</b>
       One of <b>apply</b>, <b>skip</b>, <b>asis</b>, or <b>none</b>, indicating which option should be the <u>default</u> when selecting an action
       for  a  given match. This is the action that will be taken when you type return without an option letter.
       The default is <b>apply</b>.

   <b>languages</b>
       A list of locale names to search for preferred  aliases.  For  example,  setting  this  to  <b>en</b>  uses  the
       transliterated  artist  name “Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky” instead of the Cyrillic script for the composer’s
       name when tagging from MusicBrainz. You can use a space-separated list of language abbreviations, like <b>en</b>
       <b>jp</b> <b>es</b>, to specify a preference order. Defaults to an empty list, meaning that no language is preferred.

   <b>ignored_alias_types</b>
       A list of alias types to be ignored when importing new items.

       See the <u>MusicBrainz</u> <u>Documentation</u> for more information on aliases.

       .._MusicBrainz Documentation: <u>https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Aliases</u>

   <b>detail</b>
       Whether the importer UI should show detailed information about each match it finds.  When  enabled,  this
       mode  prints  out  the title of every track, regardless of whether it matches the original metadata. (The
       default behavior only shows changes.) Default: <b>no</b>.

   <b>group_albums</b>
       By default, the beets importer groups tracks into albums based on the directories they  reside  in.  This
       option  instead uses files’ metadata to partition albums. Enable this option if you have directories that
       contain tracks from many albums mixed together.

       The <b>--group-albums</b> or <b>-g</b> option to the <u>import</u> command is equivalent, and the <u>G</u> interactive option invokes
       the same workflow.

       Default: <b>no</b>.

   <b>autotag</b>
       By default, the beets importer always attempts to autotag new music. If most of your collection  consists
       of  obscure  music, you may be interested in disabling autotagging by setting this option to <b>no</b>. (You can
       re-enable it with the <b>-a</b> flag to the <u>import</u> command.)

       Default: <b>yes</b>.

   <b>duplicate_keys</b>
       The fields used to find duplicates when importing.  There are two sub-values here: <b>album</b> and <b>item</b>.   Each
       one is a list of field names; if an existing object (album or item) in the library matches the new object
       on all of these fields, the importer will consider it a duplicate.

       Default:

          album: albumartist album
          item: artist title

   <b>duplicate_action</b>
       Either  <b>skip</b>,  <b>keep</b>,  <b>remove</b>,  <b>merge</b> or <b>ask</b>.  Controls how duplicates are treated in import task.  “skip”
       means that new item(album or track) will be skipped; “keep” means keep both old and new  items;  “remove”
       means  remove  old  item; “merge” means merge into one album; “ask” means the user should be prompted for
       the action each time. The default is <b>ask</b>.

   <b>duplicate_verbose_prompt</b>
       Usually when duplicates are detected during import, information about the existing and the newly imported
       album is summarized. Enabling this option also  lists  details  on  individual  tracks.  The  <u>format_item</u>
       <u>setting</u> is applied, which would, considering the default, look like this:

          This item is already in the library!
          Old: 1 items, MP3, 320kbps, 5:56, 13.6 MiB
            Artist Name - Album Name - Third Track Title
          New: 2 items, MP3, 320kbps, 7:18, 17.1 MiB
            Artist Name - Album Name - First Track Title
            Artist Name - Album Name - Second Track Title
          [S]kip new, Keep all, Remove old, Merge all?

       Default: <b>no</b>.

   <b>bell</b>
       Ring the terminal bell to get your attention when the importer needs your input.

       Default: <b>no</b>.

   <b>set_fields</b>
       A dictionary indicating fields to set to values for newly imported music.  Here’s an example:

          set_fields:
              genre: 'To Listen'
              collection: 'Unordered'

       Other  field/value pairs supplied via the <b>--set</b> option on the command-line override any settings here for
       fields with the same name.

       Values support the same template syntax as beets’ <u>path</u> <u>formats</u>.

       Fields are set on both the album and each individual track of the album.  Fields  are  persisted  to  the
       media files of each track.

       Default: <b>{}</b> (empty).

   <b>singleton_album_disambig</b>
       During  singleton  imports  and  if  the  metadata  source  provides  it, album names are appended to the
       disambiguation string of matching track candidates. For example: <b>The</b> <b>Artist</b> <b>-</b> <b>The</b> <b>Title</b>  <b>(Discogs,</b>  <b>Index</b>
       <b>3,</b>  <b>Track</b>  <b>B1,</b>  <b>[The</b>  <b>Album]</b>.   This feature is currently supported by the <u>Discogs</u> <u>Plugin</u> and the <u>Spotify</u>
       <u>Plugin</u>.

       Default: <b>yes</b>.

</pre><h4><b>MUSICBRAINZ</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       You can instruct beets to use <u>your</u> <u>own</u> <u>MusicBrainz</u> <u>database</u> instead of the <u>main</u>  <u>server</u>.  Use  the  <b>host</b>,
       <b>https</b> and <b>ratelimit</b> options under a <b>musicbrainz:</b> header, like so:

          musicbrainz:
              host: localhost:5000
              https: no
              ratelimit: 100

       The  <b>host</b>  key, of course, controls the Web server hostname (and port, optionally) that will be contacted
       by beets (default: musicbrainz.org).  The <b>https</b> key makes the client use  HTTPS  instead  of  HTTP.  This
       setting applies only to custom servers. The official MusicBrainz server always uses HTTPS. (Default: no.)
       The server must have search indices enabled (see <u>Building</u> <u>search</u> <u>indexes</u>).

       The <b>ratelimit</b> option, an integer, controls the number of Web service requests per second (default: 1). <b>Do</b>
       <b>not</b>  <b>change</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>rate</b>  <b>limit</b>  <b>setting</b> if you’re using the main MusicBrainz server—on this public server,
       you’re <u>limited</u> to one request per second.

   <b>enabled</b>
       This option allows you to disable using MusicBrainz as a metadata source. This applies if you use plugins
       that fetch data from alternative sources and should make the import process quicker.

       Default: <b>yes</b>.

   <b>searchlimit</b>
       The number of matches returned when sending search queries to the MusicBrainz server.

       Default: <b>5</b>.

   <b>extra_tags</b>
       By default, beets will use only the artist, album, and track count to query MusicBrainz. Additional  tags
       to be queried can be supplied with the <b>extra_tags</b> setting. For example:

          musicbrainz:
              extra_tags: [year, catalognum, country, media, label]

       This setting should improve the autotagger results if the metadata with the given tags match the metadata
       returned by MusicBrainz.

       Note that the only tags supported by this setting are the ones listed in the above example.

       Default: <b>[]</b>

   <b>genres</b>
       Use  MusicBrainz  genre tags to populate (and replace if it’s already set) the <b>genre</b> tag.  This will make
       it a list of all the genres tagged for the release and the release-group on MusicBrainz, separated by  “;
       “ and sorted by the total number of votes.  Default: <b>no</b>

   <b>external_ids</b>
       Set  any  of  the  <b>external_ids</b>  options  to  <b>yes</b> to enable the MusicBrainz importer to look for links to
       related metadata sources. If such a link is available the release ID  will  be  extracted  from  the  URL
       provided and imported to the beets library:

          musicbrainz:
              external_ids:
                  discogs: yes
                  spotify: yes
                  bandcamp: yes
                  beatport: yes
                  deezer: yes
                  tidal: yes

       The library fields of the corresponding <u>Autotagger</u> <u>Extensions</u> are used to save the data (<b>discogs_albumid</b>,
       <b>bandcamp_album_id</b>,  <b>spotify_album_id</b>,  <b>beatport_album_id</b>, <b>deezer_album_id</b>, <b>tidal_album_id</b>). On re-imports
       existing data will be overwritten.

       The default of all options is <b>no</b>.

</pre><h4><b>AUTOTAGGER</b> <b>MATCHING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       You can configure some aspects of the logic beets uses when automatically  matching  MusicBrainz  results
       under  the  <b>match:</b>  section.  To  control  how  <u>tolerant</u>  the  autotagger  is  of  differences,  use  the
       <b>strong_rec_thresh</b> option, which reflects the distance threshold below which beets  will  make  a  “strong
       recommendation”  that  the metadata be used. Strong recommendations are accepted automatically (except in
       “timid” mode), so you can use this to make beets ask your opinion more or less often.

       The threshold is a <u>distance</u> value between 0.0 and 1.0, so you can think  of  it  as  the  opposite  of  a
       <u>similarity</u> value. For example, if you want to automatically accept any matches above 90% similarity, use:

          match:
              strong_rec_thresh: 0.10

       The default strong recommendation threshold is 0.04.

       The  <b>medium_rec_thresh</b>  and  <b>rec_gap_thresh</b>  options  work  similarly.  When  a match is below the <u>medium</u>
       recommendation threshold or the distance between it and the next-best match is above the  <u>gap</u>  threshold,
       the  importer  will  suggest that match but not automatically confirm it. Otherwise, you’ll see a list of
       options to choose from.

   <b>max_rec</b>
       As mentioned above, autotagger matches have <u>recommendations</u> that control how the UI behaves for a certain
       quality of match. The recommendation for a certain match is based on the  overall  distance  calculation.
       But  you  can  also  control  the  recommendation when a specific distance penalty is applied by defining
       <u>maximum</u> recommendations for each field:

       To define maxima, use keys under <b>max_rec:</b> in the <b>match</b> section. The defaults are “medium” for missing and
       unmatched tracks and “strong” (i.e., no maximum) for everything else:

          match:
              max_rec:
                  missing_tracks: medium
                  unmatched_tracks: medium

       If a recommendation is higher than the configured maximum and  the  indicated  penalty  is  applied,  the
       recommendation  is downgraded. The setting for each field can be one of <b>none</b>, <b>low</b>, <b>medium</b> or <b>strong</b>. When
       the maximum recommendation is <b>strong</b>, no “downgrading” occurs. The available penalty names here are:

       • source

       • artist

       • album

       • media

       • mediums

       • year

       • country

       • label

       • catalognum

       • albumdisambig

       • album_id

       • tracks

       • missing_tracks

       • unmatched_tracks

       • track_title

       • track_artist

       • track_index

       • track_length

       • track_id

   <b>preferred</b>
       In addition to comparing the tagged metadata with the match metadata for similarity, you can also specify
       an ordered list of preferred countries and media types.

       A distance penalty will be applied if the country or media type from the match  metadata  doesn’t  match.
       The  specified  values  are  preferred in descending order (i.e., the first item will be most preferred).
       Each item may be a regular expression, and will be matched case insensitively. The number of  media  will
       be stripped when matching preferred media (e.g. “2x” in “2xCD”).

       You  can also tell the autotagger to prefer matches that have a release year closest to the original year
       for an album.

       Here’s an example:

          match:
              preferred:
                  countries: ['US', 'GB|UK']
                  media: ['CD', 'Digital Media|File']
                  original_year: yes

       By default, none of these options are enabled.

   <b>ignored</b>
       You can completely avoid matches that have certain penalties applied by adding the penalty  name  to  the
       <b>ignored</b> setting:

          match:
              ignored: missing_tracks unmatched_tracks

       The available penalties are the same as those for the <u>max_rec</u> setting.

       For  example,  setting  <b>ignored:</b>  <b>missing_tracks</b>  will  skip any album matches where your audio files are
       missing some of the tracks. The importer will not attempt to display these matches. It  does  not  ignore
       the  fact  that  the album is missing tracks, which would allow these matches to apply more easily. To do
       that, you’ll want to adjust the penalty for missing tracks.

   <b>required</b>
       You can avoid matches that lack certain required information. Add the tags you want  to  enforce  to  the
       <b>required</b> setting:

          match:
              required: year label catalognum country

       No tags are required by default.

   <b>ignored_media</b>
       A  list of media (i.e., formats) in metadata databases to ignore when matching music. You can use this to
       ignore all media that usually contain video instead of audio, for example:

          match:
              ignored_media: ['Data CD', 'DVD', 'DVD-Video', 'Blu-ray', 'HD-DVD',
                              'VCD', 'SVCD', 'UMD', 'VHS']

       No formats are ignored by default.

   <b>ignore_data_tracks</b>
       By default, audio files contained in data tracks within a release are included in the album’s  tracklist.
       If you want them to be included, set it <b>no</b>.

       Default: <b>yes</b>.

   <b>ignore_video_tracks</b>
       By  default,  video tracks within a release will be ignored. If you want them to be included (for example
       if you would like to track the audio-only versions of the video tracks), set it to <b>no</b>.

       Default: <b>yes</b>.

</pre><h4><b>PATH</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       You can also configure the directory hierarchy beets uses to store music.  These  settings  appear  under
       the  <b>paths:</b>  key.  Each  string  is  a  template string that can refer to metadata fields like <b>$artist</b> or
       <b>$title</b>. The filename extension is added automatically. At the  moment,  you  can  specify  three  special
       paths:  <b>default</b>  for  most  releases,  <b>comp</b>  for  “various  artist” releases with no dominant artist, and
       <b>singleton</b> for non-album tracks. The defaults look like this:

          paths:
              default: $albumartist/$album%aunique{}/$track $title
              singleton: Non-Album/$artist/$title
              comp: Compilations/$album%aunique{}/$track $title

       Note the use of <b>$albumartist</b> instead of <b>$artist</b>; this ensures that albums  will  be  well-organized.  For
       more  about these format strings, see <u>Path</u> <u>Formats</u>. The <b>aunique{}</b> function ensures that identically-named
       albums are placed in different directories; see <u>Album</u> <u>Disambiguation</u> for details.

       In addition to <b>default</b>, <b>comp</b>, and <b>singleton</b>, you can condition path queries based on beets  queries  (see
       <u>Queries</u>). This means that a config file like this:

          paths:
              albumtype:soundtrack: Soundtracks/$album/$track $title

       will  place soundtrack albums in a separate directory. The queries are tested in the order they appear in
       the configuration file, meaning that if an item matches multiple queries, beets will use the path  format
       for the <u>first</u> matching query.

       Note  that  the  special  <b>singleton</b>  and <b>comp</b> path format conditions are, in fact, just shorthand for the
       explicit queries <b>singleton:true</b> and  <b>comp:true</b>.  In  contrast,  <b>default</b>  is  special  and  has  no  query
       equivalent: the <b>default</b> format is only used if no queries match.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>LOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       The beets configuration file is usually located in a standard location that depends on your OS, but there
       are a couple of ways you can tell beets where to look.

   <b>Environment</b> <b>Variable</b>
       First,  you  can set the <b>BEETSDIR</b> environment variable to a directory containing a <b>config.yaml</b> file. This
       replaces your configuration in the default location. This also affects where auxiliary  files,  like  the
       library  database, are stored by default (that’s where relative paths are resolved to).  This environment
       variable is useful if you need to manage multiple beets libraries with separate configurations.

   <b>Command-Line</b> <b>Option</b>
       Alternatively, you can use the <b>--config</b> command-line option to indicate a YAML  file  containing  options
       that  will  then  be  merged with your existing options (from <b>BEETSDIR</b> or the default locations). This is
       useful if you want to keep your configuration mostly the same but modify a few options as  a  batch.  For
       example,  you  might have different strategies for importing files, each with a different set of importer
       options.

   <b>Default</b> <b>Location</b>
       In the absence of a <b>BEETSDIR</b> variable, beets searches a few places for your configuration,  depending  on
       the platform:

       • On  Unix  platforms,  including OS X:<b><a href="file:~/.config/beets">~/.config/beets</a></b> and then <b>$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/beets</b>, if the environment
         variable is set.

       • On OS X, we also search <b><a href="file:~/Library/Application">~/Library/Application</a></b> <b>Support/beets</b> before the Unixy locations.

       • On Windows: <b>~\AppData\Roaming\beets</b>, and then <b>%APPDATA%\beets</b>, if the environment variable is set.

       Beets uses the first directory in your platform’s list that  contains  <b>config.yaml</b>.  If  no  config  file
       exists, the last path in the list is used.

       Here’s an example file:

          directory: /var/mp3
          import:
              copy: yes
              write: yes
              log: beetslog.txt
          art_filename: albumart
          plugins: bpd
          pluginpath: <a href="file:~/beets/myplugins">~/beets/myplugins</a>
          ui:
              color: yes

          paths:
              default: $genre/$albumartist/$album/$track $title
              singleton: Singletons/$artist - $title
              comp: $genre/$album/$track $title
              albumtype:soundtrack: Soundtracks/$album/$track $title
