</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dput.cf - Debian package upload tool configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manpage gives a brief overview of dput’s configuration file and the available options in it. dput is
       a tool to upload Debian packages to the archive.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dput</b> reads, in order, these files:

        1. <u>/etc/dput.cf</u>

        2. <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dput/dput.cf</u>, or if that does not exist <u><a href="file:~/.dput.cf">~/.dput.cf</a></u>

        3. The file supplied via command line argument

       By default <b>all</b> configuration file locations are parsed, and overlaid in a additive manner. This way both,
       entire profiles and actual settings within a profile is inherited from any parent location defining a key
       within the current scope.

       dput.cf consists of different groups of configuration options, one for each host where you want to be
       able to upload packages. Hosts are defined using an identifier header with a short name for the host,
       enclosed in square brackets. Note that only if multiple such headers are encountered in the
       configuration, only the group following the last header is considered. This is done to avoid confusion
       when overriding a global configuration file with a user-specific one. There’s a special identifier,
       [DEFAULT], which holds default parameters for all the hosts. The defaults can be overridden by redefining
       them again in each host section.

   <b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>KEYS</b>
       These keys are supported in dput.cf files. For their meaning refer to <b><a href="../man5/dput.5.html">dput</a>(5)</b>.

       <b>allow_dcut</b>, <b>allow_unsigned_uploads</b>, <b>allowed_distributions</b>, <b>default_host_main</b>, <b>default_keyid</b>, <b>fqdn</b>,
       <b>distributions</b>, <b>hash</b>, <b>incoming</b>, <b>method</b>, <b>login</b>, <b>passive_ftp</b>, <b>post_upload_command</b>, <b>pre_upload_command</b>,
       <b>run_lintian</b>.

   <b>UNSUPPORTED</b> <b>LEGACY</b> <b>KEYS</b>
       These keys known and understood to the original dput implementation are not understood by dput-ng:

       <b>delayed</b>
           This key is not supported. Use the <b>--delayed</b> switch from the command line, or set <b>incoming</b> to the
           actual delayed directory if you really rely on this key.

       <b>run_dinstall</b>
           Not supported. Please submit a post-upload hook if you’d like to run <b>dinstall</b>.

       <b>check_version</b>
           Not supported.

       <b>progress_indicator</b>
           Not supported yet.

       <b>scp_compress</b>
           SCP compression is enabled by default. This is, however not configurable currently.

       <b>ssh_config_options</b>
           Not supported. Please switch to the <u>sftp</u> method which supports your options from <b><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a>(5)</b>
           natively.

   <b>UNSUPPORTED</b> <b>KEYS</b>
       These keys are not supported in old-style configuration files. However, their values are inherited from
       their new-style defaults. See <b><a href="../man5/dput.5.html">dput</a>(5)</b> for details:

       <b>default_keyid</b>, <b>hooks</b>, <b>interface</b>, <b>meta</b>, <b>full_upload_log</b>.
