</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       horst.conf - configuration file for <b><a href="../man8/horst.8.html">horst</a>(8)</b>

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/horst.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  file  <u>/etc/horst.conf</u>  is the default configuration file. The configuration file consists of zero or
       more lines.  Each line must be either <b>EMPTY</b>, <b>COMMENT</b> or <b>OPTION</b> and must end with  a  new  line  character
       ('\n', ASCII 0xa).

       <b>EMPTY</b> lines must have zero or more spaces (' ', ASCII 0x20).

       <b>COMMENT</b> lines must begin with a hash sign ('#', ASCII 0x23).

       <b>OPTION</b> lines must be in the following form:

              option[=value]

       Options and their acceptable values are described below in section <b>OPTIONS</b>.

       Lines not matching the format described above will cause <b>horst</b> to exit with non-zero status.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       channel=CHANNEL_NUMBER
              Set the initial channel number to which <b>horst</b> tunes the radio at startup.

       channel_dwell=MILLISECONDS
              Set the time <b>horst</b> scans each channel when channel_scan=1 is defined.

       channel_scan
              Make <b>horst</b> change/scan channels automatically in ascending numeric order.

       channel_scan_rounds=N
              Set  the  number of rounds <b>horst</b> scans the channel range when channel_scan=1 is defined. When N is
              reached, <b>horst</b> exits with zero status. If N is a negative number, <b>horst</b> scans  the  channel  range
              infinitely.

       channel_upper=CHANNEL_NUMBER
              Set  the  highest channel <b>horst</b> will change to when channel_scan=1 is defined. When CHANNEL_NUMBER
              is reached, the next channel will be 1.

       client=SERVER_ADDRESS
              Run <b>horst</b> in client mode and connect to a server running in SERVER_ADDRESS.

       control_pipe=FILEPATH
              Accept control commands on a named pipe.

       display_interval=MILLISECONDS
              Set the refresh interval of the user interface display. This option can be used to reduce CPU load
              by using longer intervals.

       display_view=history|essid|statistics|spectrum
              Set the initial display view.

       filter_bssid=BSSID[,BSSID]...
              Ignore all packets except packets belonging to BSSID.

       filter_mac=MAC_ADDRESS[,MAC_ADDRESS]...
              Ignore all packets except packets originating from MAC_ADDRESS.

       filter_mode=MODE[,MODE]...
              Ignore all packets/nodes except packets/nodes of mode MODE.

       filter_packet=PACKET_TYPE[,PACKET_TYPE]...
              Ignore all packets except packets of type PACKET_TYPE.

       interface=INTERFACE_NAME
              Set the wireless  interface  which  <b>horst</b>  uses  to  monitor  the  radio  spectrum.  If  interface
              INTERFACE_NAME  is  not already in monitor mode at startup, <b>horst</b> first tries to put the interface
              in monitor mode and if it fails, a temporary virtual monitor interface is added and used  instead.
              The  name  of  the  temporary  virtual  monitor  interface is in the form horst[0-9]+. The virtual
              interface created by <b>horst</b> is deleted at exit.

       add_monitor
              Always add virtual monitor interface. Don't try to set existing interface to monitor mode.

       mac_names=FILEPATH
              The file containing a mapping from MAC  addresses  to  host  names.  The  file  can  either  be  a
              dhcp.leases   file   from  dnsmasq  or  contain  mappings  in  the  form  "MAC&lt;space&gt;name"  (e.g.:
              "00:01:02:03:04:05 test") line by line.

       node_timeout=SECONDS
              Set the time after nodes will be removed if no frames have been received from them.

       outfile=FILEPATH
              Write information about each received packet to FILEPATH.

       port=PORT_NUMBER
              Set the port <b>horst</b> listens to when run in server mode or the port which <b>horst</b> connects to when run
              in client mode.

       quiet  Make <b>horst</b> less verbose and suppress the user interface.

       receive_buffer=BYTES
              Set the size of the receive buffer. This option can be used to tune memory consumption and  reduce
              packet loss under high load.

       server Run <b>horst</b> in server mode.
