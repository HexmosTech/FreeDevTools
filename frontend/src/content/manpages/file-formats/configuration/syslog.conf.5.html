       syslog.conf — configuration file for <u><a href="../man8/syslogd.8.html">syslogd</a></u>(8)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>syslog.conf</b> file is the configuration file for the <u><a href="../man8/syslogd.8.html">syslogd</a></u>(8) program.  It consists of lines with two
       fields:  the  <u>selector</u>  field  which  specifies  the  types  of messages and priorities to which the line
       applies, and an <u>action</u> field which specifies the action to be taken if a message <u>syslogd</u> receives matches
       the selection criteria.  The <u>selector</u> field is separated from the <u>action</u> field by  one  or  more  tab  or
       space characters. A rule can be split in several lines if all lines except the last are terminated with a
       backslash ("

       The <u>Selectors</u> function are encoded as a <u>facility</u>, a period ("."), and a <u>level</u>, with no intervening white-
       space.  Both the <u>facility</u> and the <u>level</u> are case insensitive.

       The  <u>facility</u>  describes  the  part  of  the  system  generating the message, and is one of the following
       keywords: auth, authpriv, cron, daemon, kern, lpr, mail,  mark,  news,  syslog,  user,  uucp  and  local0
       through  local7.   These  keywords  (with  the exception of mark) correspond to the similar “LOG_” values
       specified to the <u><a href="../man3/openlog.3.html">openlog</a></u>(3) and <u><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></u>(3) library routines.

       The <u>level</u> describes the severity of the message, and is a keyword from the following ordered list (higher
       to lower): emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice and debug.  These keywords correspond to the  similar
       (LOG_) values specified to the <u>syslog</u> library routine.

       See <u><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></u>(3) for a further descriptions of both the <u>facility</u> and <u>level</u> keywords and their significance.

       If  a  received message matches the specified <u>facility</u> and is of the specified <u>level</u> <u>(or</u> <u>a</u> <u>higher</u> <u>level)</u>,
       the action specified in the <u>action</u> field will be taken.

       Multiple <u>selectors</u> may be specified  for  a  single  <u>action</u>  by  separating  them  with  semicolon  (";")
       characters.  It is important to note, however, that each <u>selector</u> can modify the ones preceding it.

       Multiple <u>facilities</u> may be specified for a single <u>level</u> by separating them with comma (",") characters.

       An asterisk ("*") can be used to specify all <u>facilities</u> or all <u>levels</u>.

       By default, a <u>level</u> applies to all messages with the same or higher <u>level</u>.  The equal ("=") character can
       be  prepended  to  a <u>level</u> to restrict this line of the configuration file to messages with the very same
       <u>level</u>.

       An exclamation mark ("!") prepended to a <u>level</u> or the asterisk means that this line of the  configuration
       file does <u>not</u> apply to the specified level (and higher ones). In conjunction with the equal sign, you can
       exclude single <u>levels</u> as well.

       The  special  <u>facility</u>  "mark"  receives  a message at priority "info" every 20 minutes (see <u><a href="../man8/syslogd.8.html">syslogd</a></u>(8)).
       This is not enabled by a <u>facility</u> field containing an asterisk.

       The special <u>level</u> "none" disables a particular <u>facility</u>.

       The <u>action</u> field of each line specifies the action to be taken when the <u>selector</u> field selects a message.
       There are five forms:

       <b>•</b>   A pathname (beginning with a leading slash).  Selected messages are appended to the file.

           You may prepend a minus ("-") to the path to omit syncing the file after each message log.  This  can
           cause  data  loss  at  system  crashes,  but  increases  performance  for  programs which use logging
           extensively.

       <b>•</b>   A named pipe (fifo), beginning with a vertical bar ("|") followed by a pathname.  The  pipe  must  be
           created  with  <u><a href="../man8/mkfifo.8.html">mkfifo</a></u>(8)  before  syslogd  reads  its configuration file.  This feature is especially
           useful fo debugging.

       <b>•</b>   A hostname (preceded by an at ("@") sign).  Selected messages are forwarded to the <u>syslogd</u> program on
           the named host.

       <b>•</b>   A comma separated list of users.  Selected messages are written to those users if they are logged in.

       <b>•</b>   An asterisk.  Selected messages are written to all logged-in users.

       Blank lines and lines whose first non-blank character is a hash ("#") character are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       A configuration file might appear as follows:

       # Log all kernel messages, authentication messages of
       # level notice or higher and anything of level err or
       # higher to the console.
       # Don't log private authentication messages!
       *.err;kern.*;auth.notice;authpriv.none  /dev/console

       # Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.
       # Don't log private authentication messages!
       *.info;mail.none;authpriv.none          /var/log/messages

       # The authpriv file has restricted access.
       authpriv.*                                              /var/log/secure

       # Log all the mail messages in one place.
       mail.*                                                  /var/log/maillog

       # Everybody gets emergency messages, plus log them on another
       # machine.
       *.emerg                                                 *
       *.emerg                                                 @arpa.berkeley.edu

       # Root and Eric get alert and higher messages.
       *.alert                                                 root,eric

       # Save mail and news errors of level err and higher in a
       # special file.
       uucp,news.crit                                          /var/log/spoolerr

       <u>/etc/syslog.conf</u>  The <u><a href="../man8/syslogd.8.html">syslogd</a></u>(8) configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The effects of multiple selectors are sometimes not intuitive.  For example "mail.crit,*.err" will select
       "mail" facility messages at the level of "err" or higher, not at the level of "crit" or higher.
