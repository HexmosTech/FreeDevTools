</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ssh_config — OpenSSH client configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) obtains configuration data from the following sources in the following order:

             1.   command-line options
             2.   user's configuration file (<u><a href="file:~/.ssh/config">~/.ssh/config</a></u>)
             3.   system-wide configuration file (<u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_config">/etc/ssh/ssh_config</a></u>)

       Unless  noted  otherwise,  for  each parameter, the first obtained value will be used.  The configuration
       files contain sections separated by <b>Host</b> specifications, and that section is only applied for hosts  that
       match  one of the patterns given in the specification.  The matched host name is usually the one given on
       the command line (see the <b>CanonicalizeHostname</b> option for exceptions).

       Since the first obtained value for each parameter is used,  more  host-specific  declarations  should  be
       given near the beginning of the file, and general defaults at the end.

       Note that the Debian <b>openssh-client</b> package sets several options as standard in <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_config">/etc/ssh/ssh_config</a></u> which
       are not the default in <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1):

             <b>•</b>   <b>Include</b> <b><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/">/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/</a>*.conf</b>
             <b>•</b>   <b>SendEnv</b> LANG LC_* COLORTERM NO_COLOR
             <b>•</b>   <b>HashKnownHosts</b> yes
             <b>•</b>   <b>GSSAPIAuthentication</b> yes

       <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/">/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/</a>*.conf</u>  files  are  included at the start of the system-wide configuration file, so
       options set there will override those in <u>/etc/ssh/ssh_config.</u>

       The file contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line.  Lines starting with  ‘#’  and  empty  lines  are
       interpreted as comments.  Arguments may optionally be enclosed in double quotes (") in order to represent
       arguments containing spaces.  Configuration options may be separated by whitespace or optional whitespace
       and  exactly  one  ‘=’; the latter format is useful to avoid the need to quote whitespace when specifying
       configuration options using the <b>ssh</b>, <b>scp</b>, and <b>sftp</b> <b>-o</b> option.

       The possible keywords and their meanings are as follows (note  that  keywords  are  case-insensitive  and
       arguments are case-sensitive):

       <b>Host</b>    Restricts  the following declarations (up to the next <b>Host</b> or <b>Match</b> keyword) to be only for those
               hosts that match one of the patterns given after the  keyword.   If  more  than  one  pattern  is
               provided,  they  should  be  separated  by  whitespace.  A single ‘*’ as a pattern can be used to
               provide global defaults for all hosts.  The host is usually the <u>hostname</u> argument  given  on  the
               command line (see the <b>CanonicalizeHostname</b> keyword for exceptions).

               A  pattern  entry  may  be  negated by prefixing it with an exclamation mark (‘!’).  If a negated
               entry is matched, then the <b>Host</b> entry is ignored, regardless of whether any other patterns on the
               line match.  Negated matches are therefore useful to provide exceptions for wildcard matches.

               See “PATTERNS” for more information on patterns.

       <b>Match</b>   Restricts the following declarations (up to the next <b>Host</b> or <b>Match</b> keyword) to be used only  when
               the  conditions  following the <b>Match</b> keyword are satisfied.  Match conditions are specified using
               one or more criteria or the single token  <b>all</b>  which  always  matches.   The  available  criteria
               keywords  are:  <b>canonical</b>,  <b>final</b>, <b>exec</b>, <b>localnetwork</b>, <b>host</b>, <b>originalhost</b>, <b>tagged</b>, <b>command</b>, <b>user</b>,
               <b>localuser</b>, and <b>version</b>.  The <b>all</b> criteria must appear alone or  immediately  after  <b>canonical</b>  or
               <b>final</b>.   Other  criteria may be combined arbitrarily.  All criteria but <b>all</b>, <b>canonical</b>, and <b>final</b>
               require an argument.  Criteria may be negated by prepending an exclamation mark (‘!’).

               The <b>canonical</b> keyword matches only when the configuration file is being re-parsed after  hostname
               canonicalization (see the <b>CanonicalizeHostname</b> option).  This may be useful to specify conditions
               that work with canonical host names only.

               The   <b>final</b>  keyword  requests  that  the  configuration  be  re-parsed  (regardless  of  whether
               <b>CanonicalizeHostname</b>  is   enabled),   and   matches   only   during   this   final   pass.    If
               <b>CanonicalizeHostname</b> is enabled, then <b>canonical</b> and <b>final</b> match during the same pass.

               The <b>exec</b> keyword executes the specified command under the user's shell.  If the command returns a
               zero  exit  status  then  the  condition  is  considered  true.   Commands  containing whitespace
               characters must be quoted.  Arguments to  <b>exec</b>  accept  the  tokens  described  in  the  “TOKENS”
               section.

               The  <b>localnetwork</b>  keyword  matches  the addresses of active local network interfaces against the
               supplied list of networks in CIDR format.  This may  be  convenient  for  varying  the  effective
               configuration  on  devices  that  roam  between  networks.   Note  that  network address is not a
               trustworthy criteria in many situations (e.g. when the network is automatically configured  using
               DHCP) and so caution should be applied if using it to control security-sensitive configuration.

               The  other  keywords'  criteria  must  be single entries or comma-separated lists and may use the
               wildcard and negation operators described in the “PATTERNS” section.

               The criteria for the <b>host</b> keyword are matched against the target hostname, after any substitution
               by the <b>Hostname</b> or <b>CanonicalizeHostname</b> options.  The <b>originalhost</b> keyword  matches  against  the
               hostname as it was specified on the command-line.

               The  <b>tagged</b>  keyword  matches  a  tag  name  specified  by a prior <b>Tag</b> directive or on the <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)
               command-line using the <b>-P</b> flag.  The <b>command</b> keyword matches the remote  command  that  has  been
               requested,  or  the  subsystem name that is being invoked (e.g. "sftp" for an SFTP session).  The
               empty string will match the case where a command or tag has not been specified, i.e.  ‘Match  tag
               ""’.    The   <b>version</b>  keyword  matches  against  the  version  string  of  <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1),  for  example
               “OpenSSH_10.0”.

               The <b>user</b> keyword matches against the target username on the remote host.  The  <b>localuser</b>  keyword
               matches  against the name of the local user running <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) (this keyword may be useful in system-
               wide <b>ssh_config</b> files).

               Finally, the <b>sessiontype</b> keyword matches the requested session type, which may be  one  of  <b>shell</b>
               for   interactive  sessions,  <b>exec</b>  for  command  execution  sessions,  <b>subsystem</b>  for  subsystem
               invocations such as <u><a href="../man1/sftp.1.html">sftp</a></u>(1), or <b>none</b> for transport-only sessions, such as when <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) is  started
               with the <b>-N</b> flag.

       <b>AddKeysToAgent</b>
               Specifies  whether  keys should be automatically added to a running <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1).  If this option
               is set to <b>yes</b> and a key is loaded from a file, the key and its passphrase are added to the  agent
               with  the  default  lifetime,  as  if  by  <u><a href="../man1/ssh-add.1.html">ssh-add</a></u>(1).  If this option is set to <b>ask</b>, <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) will
               require confirmation using the SSH_ASKPASS program  before  adding  a  key  (see  <u><a href="../man1/ssh-add.1.html">ssh-add</a></u>(1)  for
               details).   If this option is set to <b>confirm</b>, each use of the key must be confirmed, as if the <b>-c</b>
               option was specified to <u><a href="../man1/ssh-add.1.html">ssh-add</a></u>(1).  If this option is set to <b>no</b>, no keys are added to the agent.
               Alternately, this option may be specified as a time interval using the format  described  in  the
               “TIME  FORMATS”  section  of  <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5) to specify the key's lifetime in <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1), after
               which it will automatically be removed.  The argument must be  <b>no</b>  (the  default),  <b>yes</b>,  <b>confirm</b>
               (optionally followed by a time interval), <b>ask</b> or a time interval.

       <b>AddressFamily</b>
               Specifies  which  address  family to use when connecting.  Valid arguments are <b>any</b> (the default),
               <b>inet</b> (use IPv4 only), or <b>inet6</b> (use IPv6 only).

       <b>BatchMode</b>
               If set to <b>yes</b>, user interaction such as password prompts and host key confirmation requests  will
               be  disabled.   In addition, the <b>ServerAliveInterval</b> option will be set to 300 seconds by default
               (Debian-specific).  This option is useful in scripts and  other  batch  jobs  where  no  user  is
               present  to  interact  with <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1), and where it is desirable to detect a broken network swiftly.
               The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).

       <b>BindAddress</b>
               Use the specified address on the local machine as the source address  of  the  connection.   Only
               useful on systems with more than one address.

       <b>BindInterface</b>
               Use  the  address  of  the  specified interface on the local machine as the source address of the
               connection.

       <b>CanonicalDomains</b>
               When <b>CanonicalizeHostname</b> is enabled, this option specifies the list of domain suffixes in  which
               to search for the specified destination host.

       <b>CanonicalizeFallbackLocal</b>
               Specifies  whether to fail with an error when hostname canonicalization fails.  The default, <b>yes</b>,
               will attempt to look up the unqualified hostname using the system  resolver's  search  rules.   A
               value of <b>no</b> will cause <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) to fail instantly if <b>CanonicalizeHostname</b> is enabled and the target
               hostname cannot be found in any of the domains specified by <b>CanonicalDomains</b>.

       <b>CanonicalizeHostname</b>
               Controls  whether  explicit  hostname  canonicalization is performed.  The default, <b>no</b>, is not to
               perform any name rewriting and let the system resolver handle all hostname lookups.   If  set  to
               <b>yes</b>  then,  for  connections  that do not use a <b>ProxyCommand</b> or <b>ProxyJump</b>, <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) will attempt to
               canonicalize the hostname specified on the command line using the <b>CanonicalDomains</b>  suffixes  and
               <b>CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs</b>   rules.    If   <b>CanonicalizeHostname</b>   is   set   to   <b>always</b>,  then
               canonicalization is applied to proxied connections too.

               If this option is enabled, then the configuration files are processed again using the new  target
               name  to  pick  up  any  new  configuration  in matching <b>Host</b> and <b>Match</b> stanzas.  A value of <b>none</b>
               disables the use of a <b>ProxyJump</b> host.

       <b>CanonicalizeMaxDots</b>
               Specifies the maximum number of dot characters in a hostname before canonicalization is disabled.
               The default, 1, allows a single dot (i.e. hostname.subdomain).

       <b>CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs</b>
               Specifies rules to determine whether CNAMEs should be  followed  when  canonicalizing  hostnames.
               The  rules  consist  of  one  or  more  arguments of <u>source_domain_list</u>:<u>target_domain_list</u>, where
               <u>source_domain_list</u> is a pattern-list of domains that may follow CNAMEs in  canonicalization,  and
               <u>target_domain_list</u> is a pattern-list of domains that they may resolve to.

               For  example,  "*.a.example.com:*.b.example.com,*.c.example.com"  will  allow  hostnames matching
               "*.a.example.com" to be canonicalized to names  in  the  "*.b.example.com"  or  "*.c.example.com"
               domains.

               A  single argument of "none" causes no CNAMEs to be considered for canonicalization.  This is the
               default behaviour.

       <b>CASignatureAlgorithms</b>
               Specifies which algorithms are allowed for signing of  certificates  by  certificate  authorities
               (CAs).  The default is:

                     ssh-ed25519,ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,
                     ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
                     <a href="mailto:sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com">sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com</a>,
                     <a href="mailto:sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com">sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com</a>,
                     rsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256

               If the specified list begins with a ‘+’ character, then the specified algorithms will be appended
               to the default set instead of replacing them.  If the specified list begins with a ‘-’ character,
               then  the specified algorithms (including wildcards) will be removed from the default set instead
               of replacing them.

               <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) will not accept host certificates signed using algorithms other than those specified.

       <b>CertificateFile</b>
               Specifies a file from which the user's certificate is read.  A corresponding private key must  be
               provided  separately in order to use this certificate either from an <b>IdentityFile</b> directive or <b>-i</b>
               flag to <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1), via <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1), or via a <b>PKCS11Provider</b> or <b>SecurityKeyProvider</b>.

               Arguments to <b>CertificateFile</b> may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's  home  directory,  the
               tokens  described  in  the  “TOKENS”  section  and  environment  variables  as  described  in the
               “ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES” section.

               It is possible to have  multiple  certificate  files  specified  in  configuration  files;  these
               certificates will be tried in sequence.  Multiple <b>CertificateFile</b> directives will add to the list
               of certificates used for authentication.

       <b>ChannelTimeout</b>
               Specifies  whether and how quickly <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) should close inactive channels.  Timeouts are specified
               as one or more “type=interval” pairs separated by  whitespace,  where  the  “type”  must  be  the
               special  keyword  “global”  or  a  channel  type  name from the list below, optionally containing
               wildcard characters.

               The timeout value “interval” is specified in seconds or may use any of the  units  documented  in
               the  “TIME  FORMATS”  section.   For  example,  “session=5m”  would cause interactive sessions to
               terminate after five minutes of inactivity.  Specifying a  zero  value  disables  the  inactivity
               timeout.

               The  special  timeout  “global”  applies  to all active channels, taken together.  Traffic on any
               active channel will reset the timeout, but when the timeout expires then all open  channels  will
               be  closed.   Note  that  this  global  timeout is not matched by wildcards and must be specified
               explicitly.

               The available channel type names include:

               <b>agent-connection</b>
                       Open connections to <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1).

               <b>direct-tcpip</b>, <b><a href="mailto:direct-streamlocal@openssh.com">direct-streamlocal@openssh.com</a></b>
                       Open TCP or Unix socket (respectively) connections that  have  been  established  from  a
                       <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) local forwarding, i.e. <b>LocalForward</b> or <b>DynamicForward</b>.

               <b>forwarded-tcpip</b>, <b><a href="mailto:forwarded-streamlocal@openssh.com">forwarded-streamlocal@openssh.com</a></b>
                       Open  TCP  or  Unix  socket  (respectively)  connections  that have been established to a
                       <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) listening on behalf of a <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) remote forwarding, i.e. <b>RemoteForward</b>.

               <b>session</b>
                       The interactive  main  session,  including  shell  session,  command  execution,  <u><a href="../man1/scp.1.html">scp</a></u>(1),
                       <u><a href="../man1/sftp.1.html">sftp</a></u>(1), etc.

               <b>tun-connection</b>
                       Open <b>TunnelForward</b> connections.

               <b>x11-connection</b>
                       Open X11 forwarding sessions.

               Note  that  in  all the above cases, terminating an inactive session does not guarantee to remove
               all resources associated with the session, e.g. shell processes or X11 clients  relating  to  the
               session may continue to execute.

               Moreover,  terminating  an  inactive  channel  or  session  does  not  necessarily  close the SSH
               connection, nor does it prevent a client from requesting another channel of the  same  type.   In
               particular, expiring an inactive forwarding session does not prevent another identical forwarding
               from being subsequently created.

               The default is not to expire channels of any type for inactivity.

       <b>CheckHostIP</b>
               If  set to <b>yes</b>, <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) will additionally check the host IP address in the <u>known_hosts</u> file.  This
               allows it to detect if a host key  changed  due  to  DNS  spoofing  and  will  add  addresses  of
               destination   hosts   to  <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a></u>  in  the  process,  regardless  of  the  setting  of
               <b>StrictHostKeyChecking</b>.  If the option is set to <b>no</b> (the default), the check will not be executed.

       <b>Ciphers</b>
               Specifies the ciphers allowed and their order of preference.  Multiple  ciphers  must  be  comma-
               separated.  If the specified list begins with a ‘+’ character, then the specified ciphers will be
               appended  to  the default set instead of replacing them.  If the specified list begins with a ‘-’
               character, then the specified ciphers (including wildcards) will be removed from the default  set
               instead of replacing them.  If the specified list begins with a ‘^’ character, then the specified
               ciphers will be placed at the head of the default set.

               The supported ciphers are:

               The list of available ciphers may also be obtained using "ssh -Q cipher".

       <b>ClearAllForwardings</b>
               Specifies  that  all  local,  remote, and dynamic port forwardings specified in the configuration
               files or on the command line be cleared.  This option is primarily  useful  when  used  from  the
               <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)  command  line  to clear port forwardings set in configuration files, and is automatically
               set by <u><a href="../man1/scp.1.html">scp</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/sftp.1.html">sftp</a></u>(1).  The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).

       <b>Compression</b>
               Specifies whether to use compression.  The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).

       <b>ConnectionAttempts</b>
               Specifies the number of tries (one per second) to make before exiting.  The argument must  be  an
               integer.  This may be useful in scripts if the connection sometimes fails.  The default is 1.

       <b>ConnectTimeout</b>
               Specifies  the  timeout (in seconds) used when connecting to the SSH server, instead of using the
               default system TCP timeout.  This timeout is applied both to establishing the connection  and  to
               performing  the  initial  SSH  protocol  handshake  and  key exchange.  <b>SetupTimeOut</b> is a Debian-
               specific compatibility alias for this option.

       <b>ControlMaster</b>
               Enables the sharing of multiple sessions over a single network  connection.   When  set  to  <b>yes</b>,
               <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)  will listen for connections on a control socket specified using the <b>ControlPath</b> argument.
               Additional sessions can connect to this socket using the same <b>ControlPath</b> with <b>ControlMaster</b>  set
               to  <b>no</b>  (the default).  These sessions will try to reuse the master instance's network connection
               rather than initiating new ones, but will fall back to connecting normally if the control  socket
               does not exist, or is not listening.

               Setting this to <b>ask</b> will cause <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) to listen for control connections, but require confirmation
               using  <u><a href="../man1/ssh-askpass.1.html">ssh-askpass</a></u>(1).   If  the  <b>ControlPath</b>  cannot  be  opened,  <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)  will continue without
               connecting to a master instance.

               X11 and <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1) forwarding is supported over  these  multiplexed  connections,  however  the
               display  and  agent  forwarded  will be the one belonging to the master connection i.e. it is not
               possible to forward multiple displays or agents.

               Two additional options allow for opportunistic multiplexing: try to use a master  connection  but
               fall  back  to  creating  a  new  one if one does not already exist.  These options are: <b>auto</b> and
               <b>autoask</b>.  The latter requires confirmation like the <b>ask</b> option.

       <b>ControlPath</b>
               Specify the path to  the  control  socket  used  for  connection  sharing  as  described  in  the
               <b>ControlMaster</b>  section  above  or  the  string  <b>none</b> to disable connection sharing.  Arguments to
               <b>ControlPath</b> may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory, the tokens described in
               the “TOKENS” section and environment  variables  as  described  in  the  “ENVIRONMENT  VARIABLES”
               section.   It  is  recommended  that  any  <b>ControlPath</b>  used for opportunistic connection sharing
               include at least %h, %p, and %r (or alternatively %C) and be placed in a directory  that  is  not
               writable by other users.  This ensures that shared connections are uniquely identified.

       <b>ControlPersist</b>
               When  used  in conjunction with <b>ControlMaster</b>, specifies that the master connection should remain
               open in the  background  (waiting  for  future  client  connections)  after  the  initial  client
               connection  has  been closed.  If set to <b>no</b> (the default), then the master connection will not be
               placed into the background, and will close as soon as the initial client  connection  is  closed.
               If  set to <b>yes</b> or 0, then the master connection will remain in the background indefinitely (until
               killed or closed via a mechanism such as the "ssh -O exit").  If set to a time in seconds,  or  a
               time  in any of the formats documented in <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5), then the backgrounded master connection
               will automatically terminate after it has remained idle (with  no  client  connections)  for  the
               specified time.

       <b>DynamicForward</b>
               Specifies  that  a  TCP  port  on the local machine be forwarded over the secure channel, and the
               application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.

               The argument must be [<u>bind_address</u>:]<u>port</u>.  IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing addresses
               in square brackets.  By default, the local port is bound  in  accordance  with  the  <b>GatewayPorts</b>
               setting.   However,  an  explicit  <u>bind_address</u>  may be used to bind the connection to a specific
               address.  The <u>bind_address</u> of <b>localhost</b> indicates that the listening port be bound for local  use
               only,  while  an  empty  address  or  ‘*’  indicates  that  the port should be available from all
               interfaces.

               Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) will act as a  SOCKS  server.
               Multiple  forwardings  may  be  specified, and additional forwardings can be given on the command
               line.  Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.

       <b>EnableEscapeCommandline</b>
               Enables the command line option in the <b>EscapeChar</b> menu for interactive sessions  (default  ‘~C’).
               By default, the command line is disabled.

       <b>EnableSSHKeysign</b>
               Setting  this  option  to <b>yes</b> in the global client configuration file <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_config">/etc/ssh/ssh_config</a></u> enables
               the use of the helper program <u><a href="../man8/ssh-keysign.8.html">ssh-keysign</a></u>(8) during <b>HostbasedAuthentication</b>.  The  argument  must
               be  <b>yes</b>  or <b>no</b> (the default).  This option should be placed in the non-hostspecific section.  See
               <u><a href="../man8/ssh-keysign.8.html">ssh-keysign</a></u>(8) for more information.

       <b>EscapeChar</b>
               Sets the escape character (default: ‘~’).  The escape character can also be set  on  the  command
               line.   The  argument  should be a single character, ‘^’ followed by a letter, or <b>none</b> to disable
               the escape character entirely (making the connection transparent for binary data).

       <b>ExitOnForwardFailure</b>
               Specifies whether <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) should terminate the connection  if  it  cannot  set  up  all  requested
               dynamic,  tunnel,  local,  and remote port forwardings, (e.g. if either end is unable to bind and
               listen on a specified port).  Note that <b>ExitOnForwardFailure</b> does not apply to  connections  made
               over  port  forwardings and will not, for example, cause <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) to exit if TCP connections to the
               ultimate forwarding destination fail.  The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).

       <b>FingerprintHash</b>
               Specifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key fingerprints.  Valid options are:  <b>md5</b>  and
               <b>sha256</b> (the default).

       <b>ForkAfterAuthentication</b>
               Requests  <b>ssh</b>  to go to background just before command execution.  This is useful if <b>ssh</b> is going
               to ask for passwords or passphrases, but the user wants it in the background.  This  implies  the
               <b>StdinNull</b>  configuration option being set to “yes”.  The recommended way to start X11 programs at
               a remote site is with something like <b>ssh</b> <b>-f</b> <b>host</b> <b>xterm</b>, which is the same as <b>ssh</b>  <b>host</b>  <b>xterm</b>  if
               the <b>ForkAfterAuthentication</b> configuration option is set to “yes”.

               If  the <b>ExitOnForwardFailure</b> configuration option is set to “yes”, then a client started with the
               <b>ForkAfterAuthentication</b> configuration option being set to “yes” will wait  for  all  remote  port
               forwards to be successfully established before placing itself in the background.  The argument to
               this keyword must be <b>yes</b> (same as the <b>-f</b> option) or <b>no</b> (the default).

       <b>ForwardAgent</b>
               Specifies  whether  the  connection to the authentication agent (if any) will be forwarded to the
               remote machine.  The argument may be <b>yes</b>, <b>no</b> (the default), an explicit path to an  agent  socket
               or the name of an environment variable (beginning with ‘$’) in which to find the path.

               Agent  forwarding  should  be  enabled  with  caution.   Users  with  the  ability to bypass file
               permissions on the remote host (for the agent's Unix-domain socket) can access  the  local  agent
               through the forwarded connection.  An attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent, however
               they  can  perform  operations  on the keys that enable them to authenticate using the identities
               loaded into the agent.

       <b>ForwardX11</b>
               Specifies whether X11 connections will be automatically redirected over the  secure  channel  and
               DISPLAY set.  The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).

               X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the ability to bypass file permissions
               on  the  remote host (for the user's X11 authorization database) can access the local X11 display
               through the forwarded connection.  An attacker may then be able to  perform  activities  such  as
               keystroke monitoring if the <b>ForwardX11Trusted</b> option is also enabled.

       <b>ForwardX11Timeout</b>
               Specify  a  timeout for untrusted X11 forwarding using the format described in the “TIME FORMATS”
               section of <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5).  X11 connections received by <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) after this time will  be  refused.
               Setting <b>ForwardX11Timeout</b> to zero will disable the timeout and permit X11 forwarding for the life
               of  the  connection.  The default is to disable untrusted X11 forwarding after twenty minutes has
               elapsed.

       <b>ForwardX11Trusted</b>
               If this option is set to <b>yes</b>, (the Debian-specific default), remote X11 clients  will  have  full
               access to the original X11 display.

               If  this  option  is  set  to  <b>no</b>  (the  upstream default), remote X11 clients will be considered
               untrusted and prevented from stealing or tampering with data belonging to  trusted  X11  clients.
               Furthermore,  the  <u><a href="../man1/xauth.1.html">xauth</a></u>(1)  token  used  for the session will be set to expire after 20 minutes.
               Remote clients will be refused access after this time.

               See the X11 SECURITY extension specification for full details  on  the  restrictions  imposed  on
               untrusted clients.

       <b>GatewayPorts</b>
               Specifies  whether  remote  hosts  are  allowed to connect to local forwarded ports.  By default,
               <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) binds local port forwardings to the loopback address.  This prevents  other  remote  hosts
               from  connecting  to  forwarded  ports.  <b>GatewayPorts</b> can be used to specify that ssh should bind
               local port forwardings to the  wildcard  address,  thus  allowing  remote  hosts  to  connect  to
               forwarded ports.  The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).

       <b>GlobalKnownHostsFile</b>
               Specifies  one  or  more  files to use for the global host key database, separated by whitespace.
               The default is <u>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</u>, <u>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts2</u>.

       <b>GSSAPIAuthentication</b>
               Specifies whether user authentication based on GSSAPI is allowed.  The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>GSSAPIClientIdentity</b>
               If set, specifies the GSSAPI client identity that ssh should use when connecting to  the  server.
               The default is unset, which means that the default identity will be used.

       <b>GSSAPIDelegateCredentials</b>
               Forward (delegate) credentials to the server.  The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>GSSAPIKeyExchange</b>
               Specifies  whether  key  exchange based on GSSAPI may be used. When using GSSAPI key exchange the
               server need not have a host key.  The default is “no”.

       <b>GSSAPIRenewalForcesRekey</b>
               If set to “yes” then renewal of the client's GSSAPI credentials will force the  rekeying  of  the
               ssh connection. With a compatible server, this will delegate the renewed credentials to a session
               on the server.

               Checks are made to ensure that credentials are only propagated when the new credentials match the
               old  ones  on  the originating client and where the receiving server still has the old set in its
               cache.

               The default is “no”.

               For this to work <b>GSSAPIKeyExchange</b> needs to be enabled in the server and also used by the client.

       <b>GSSAPIServerIdentity</b>
               If set, specifies the GSSAPI server identity that  ssh  should  expect  when  connecting  to  the
               server.  The  default  is  unset,  which  means  that the expected GSSAPI server identity will be
               determined from the target hostname.

       <b>GSSAPITrustDns</b>
               Set to “yes” to indicate that the DNS is trusted to securely canonicalize the name  of  the  host
               being connected to. If “no”, the hostname entered on the command line will be passed untouched to
               the GSSAPI library.  The default is “no”.

       <b>GSSAPIKexAlgorithms</b>
               The list of key exchange algorithms that are offered for GSSAPI key exchange. Possible values are

                  gss-gex-sha1-,
                  gss-group1-sha1-,
                  gss-group14-sha1-,
                  gss-group14-sha256-,
                  gss-group16-sha512-,
                  gss-nistp256-sha256-,

                  gss-curve25519-sha256-
               The                                           default                                          is
               “gss-group14-sha256-,gss-group16-sha512-,gss-nistp256-sha256-,gss-curve25519-sha256-,gss-gex-sha1-,gss-group14-sha1-”.
               This option only applies to connections using GSSAPI.

       <b>HashKnownHosts</b>
               Indicates  that  <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)  should  hash  host  names  and  addresses  when  they   are   added   to
               <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a></u>.   These  hashed names may be used normally by <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8), but they do
               not visually reveal identifying information if the file's contents are disclosed.  The default is
               <b>no</b>.  Note that existing  names  and  addresses  in  known  hosts  files  will  not  be  converted
               automatically,  but  may  be  manually  hashed using <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></u>(1).  Use of this option may break
               facilities such as tab-completion that rely on being  able  to  read  unhashed  host  names  from
               <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a></u>.

       <b>HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms</b>
               Specifies  the  signature  algorithms  that will be used for hostbased authentication as a comma-
               separated list of patterns.  Alternately if the specified list begins with a ‘+’ character,  then
               the specified signature algorithms will be appended to the default set instead of replacing them.
               If  the  specified  list  begins  with  a  ‘-’ character, then the specified signature algorithms
               (including wildcards) will be removed from the default set instead of  replacing  them.   If  the
               specified  list  begins  with  a  ‘^’  character, then the specified signature algorithms will be
               placed at the head of the default set.  The default for this option is:

               The <b>-Q</b> option of <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) may be used to list supported signature algorithms.   This  was  formerly
               named HostbasedKeyTypes.

       <b>HostbasedAuthentication</b>
               Specifies  whether  to  try  rhosts  based  authentication  with  public key authentication.  The
               argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).

       <b>HostKeyAlgorithms</b>
               Specifies the host key signature algorithms that the client wants to use in order of  preference.
               Alternately  if  the  specified  list  begins  with a ‘+’ character, then the specified signature
               algorithms will be appended to the default set instead of replacing them.  If the specified  list
               begins  with  a ‘-’ character, then the specified signature algorithms (including wildcards) will
               be removed from the default set instead of replacing them.  If the specified list begins  with  a
               ‘^’  character, then the specified signature algorithms will be placed at the head of the default
               set.  The default for this option is:

               If hostkeys are known for the destination host then this default  is  modified  to  prefer  their
               algorithms.

               The list of available signature algorithms may also be obtained using "ssh -Q HostKeyAlgorithms".

       <b>HostKeyAlias</b>
               Specifies  an  alias  that should be used instead of the real host name when looking up or saving
               the host key in the host key database files and when validating host certificates.   This  option
               is useful for tunneling SSH connections or for multiple servers running on a single host.

       <b>Hostname</b>
               Specifies the real host name to log into.  This can be used to specify nicknames or abbreviations
               for  hosts.   Arguments to <b>Hostname</b> accept the tokens described in the “TOKENS” section.  Numeric
               IP addresses are also permitted (both on the command line and in <b>Hostname</b>  specifications).   The
               default is the name given on the command line.

       <b>IdentitiesOnly</b>
               Specifies  that  <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)  should  only  use the configured authentication identity and certificate
               files (either the default files, or those explicitly configured in the <b>ssh_config</b> files or passed
               on the <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) command-line), even if <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1)  or  a  <b>PKCS11Provider</b>  or  <b>SecurityKeyProvider</b>
               offers  more  identities.   The  argument  to this keyword must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).  This
               option is intended for situations where ssh-agent offers many different identities.

       <b>IdentityAgent</b>
               Specifies the Unix-domain socket used to communicate with the authentication agent.

               This option overrides the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable and can be used to select a specific
               agent.  Setting the socket name to <b>none</b> disables the use of  an  authentication  agent.   If  the
               string  "SSH_AUTH_SOCK"  is  specified,  the  location  of  the  socket  will  be  read  from the
               SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment  variable.   Otherwise  if  the  specified  value  begins  with  a  ‘$’
               character,  then  it  will  be  treated as an environment variable containing the location of the
               socket.

               Arguments to <b>IdentityAgent</b> may use the tilde syntax to refer to  a  user's  home  directory,  the
               tokens  described  in  the  “TOKENS”  section  and  environment  variables  as  described  in the
               “ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES” section.

       <b>IdentityFile</b>
               Specifies a file from which the user's ECDSA, authenticator-hosted ECDSA, Ed25519, authenticator-
               hosted Ed25519 or RSA authentication identity is read.  You can also specify a public key file to
               use the corresponding private key that is loaded in <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1) when the private key file is not
               present  locally.    The   default   is   <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_rsa">~/.ssh/id_rsa</a></u>,   <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ecdsa">~/.ssh/id_ecdsa</a></u>,   <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk">~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk</a></u>,
               <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ed25519">~/.ssh/id_ed25519</a></u>  and  <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk">~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk</a></u>.   Additionally,  any  identities represented by the
               authentication agent will be used  for  authentication  unless  <b>IdentitiesOnly</b>  is  set.   If  no
               certificates  have  been  explicitly  specified  by  <b>CertificateFile</b>,  <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)  will  try  to load
               certificate information from the filename obtained by  appending  <u>-cert.pub</u>  to  the  path  of  a
               specified <b>IdentityFile</b>.

               Arguments  to  <b>IdentityFile</b>  may  use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory or the
               tokens described in the “TOKENS” section.  Alternately  an  argument  of  <b>none</b>  may  be  used  to
               indicate no identity files should be loaded.

               It  is  possible  to  have  multiple  identity  files specified in configuration files; all these
               identities will be tried in sequence.  Multiple <b>IdentityFile</b> directives will add to the  list  of
               identities tried (this behaviour differs from that of other configuration directives).

               <b>IdentityFile</b>  may  be  used  in  conjunction with <b>IdentitiesOnly</b> to select which identities in an
               agent are offered during authentication.  <b>IdentityFile</b> may  also  be  used  in  conjunction  with
               <b>CertificateFile</b>  in  order  to  provide  any  certificate also needed for authentication with the
               identity.

       <b>IgnoreUnknown</b>
               Specifies  a  pattern-list  of  unknown  options  to  be  ignored  if  they  are  encountered  in
               configuration  parsing.   This may be used to suppress errors if <b>ssh_config</b> contains options that
               are unrecognised by <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).  It  is  recommended  that  <b>IgnoreUnknown</b>  be  listed  early  in  the
               configuration file as it will not be applied to unknown options that appear before it.

       <b>Include</b>
               Include  the  specified  configuration  file(s).   Multiple  pathnames  may be specified and each
               pathname may contain <u><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></u>(7) wildcards, tokens as described in the “TOKENS” section,  environment
               variables  as  described  in  the  “ENVIRONMENT  VARIABLES” section and, for user configurations,
               shell-like ‘~’ references to user home directories.  Wildcards will be expanded and processed  in
               lexical  order.   Files  without absolute paths are assumed to be in <u><a href="file:~/.ssh">~/.ssh</a></u> if included in a user
               configuration file or <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh">/etc/ssh</a></u> if included from the system configuration file.  <b>Include</b> directive
               may appear inside a <b>Match</b> or <b>Host</b> block to perform conditional inclusion.

       <b>IPQoS</b>   Specifies the IPv4 type-of-service or DSCP class for  connections.   Accepted  values  are  <b>af11</b>,
               <b>af12</b>,  <b>af13</b>,  <b>af21</b>, <b>af22</b>, <b>af23</b>, <b>af31</b>, <b>af32</b>, <b>af33</b>, <b>af41</b>, <b>af42</b>, <b>af43</b>, <b>cs0</b>, <b>cs1</b>, <b>cs2</b>, <b>cs3</b>, <b>cs4</b>, <b>cs5</b>,
               <b>cs6</b>, <b>cs7</b>, <b>ef</b>, <b>le</b>, <b>lowdelay</b>, <b>throughput</b>,  <b>reliability</b>,  a  numeric  value,  or  <b>none</b>  to  use  the
               operating  system  default.   This option may take one or two arguments, separated by whitespace.
               If one argument is specified, it is used as the packet class unconditionally.  If two values  are
               specified,  the  first is automatically selected for interactive sessions and the second for non-
               interactive sessions.  The default is <b>lowdelay</b> for interactive sessions and <b>throughput</b>  for  non-
               interactive sessions.

       <b>KbdInteractiveAuthentication</b>
               Specifies  whether to use keyboard-interactive authentication.  The argument to this keyword must
               be <b>yes</b> (the default) or <b>no</b>.  <b>ChallengeResponseAuthentication</b> is a deprecated alias for this.

       <b>KbdInteractiveDevices</b>
               Specifies the list of methods to use in  keyboard-interactive  authentication.   Multiple  method
               names  must  be  comma-separated.   The default is to use the server specified list.  The methods
               available vary depending on what the server supports.  For an OpenSSH server, it may be  zero  or
               more of: <b>bsdauth</b> and <b>pam</b>.

       <b>KexAlgorithms</b>
               Specifies  the  permitted  KEX  (Key  Exchange) algorithms that will be used and their preference
               order.  The selected algorithm will be the first algorithm in this  list  that  the  server  also
               supports.  Multiple algorithms must be comma-separated.

               If the specified list begins with a ‘+’ character, then the specified algorithms will be appended
               to the default set instead of replacing them.  If the specified list begins with a ‘-’ character,
               then  the specified algorithms (including wildcards) will be removed from the default set instead
               of replacing them.  If the specified list  begins  with  a  ‘^’  character,  then  the  specified
               algorithms will be placed at the head of the default set.

               The default is:

                     mlkem768x25519-sha256,
                     sntrup761x25519-sha512,<a href="mailto:sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com">sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com</a>,

                     diffie-hellman-group18-sha512,
                     diffie-hellman-group14-sha256

               The list of supported key exchange algorithms may also be obtained using "ssh -Q kex".

       <b>KnownHostsCommand</b>
               Specifies  a  command  to  use  to  obtain  a  list  of host keys, in addition to those listed in
               <b>UserKnownHostsFile</b> and <b>GlobalKnownHostsFile</b>.  This command is executed after the files have  been
               read.   It  may  write  host  key lines to standard output in identical format to the usual files
               (described in the “VERIFYING HOST KEYS”  section  in  <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)).   Arguments  to  <b>KnownHostsCommand</b>
               accept  the  tokens described in the “TOKENS” section.  The command may be invoked multiple times
               per connection: once when preparing the preference list of host key algorithms to use,  again  to
               obtain  the host key for the requested host name and, if <b>CheckHostIP</b> is enabled, one more time to
               obtain the host key matching the server's address.  If the command exits abnormally or returns  a
               non-zero exit status then the connection is terminated.

       <b>LocalCommand</b>
               Specifies  a command to execute on the local machine after successfully connecting to the server.
               The command string extends to the end of the  line,  and  is  executed  with  the  user's  shell.
               Arguments to <b>LocalCommand</b> accept the tokens described in the “TOKENS” section.

               The  command  is  run  synchronously  and  does not have access to the session of the <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) that
               spawned it.  It should not be used for interactive commands.

               This directive is ignored unless <b>PermitLocalCommand</b> has been enabled.

       <b>LocalForward</b>
               Specifies that a TCP port or Unix-domain socket on the local machine be forwarded over the secure
               channel to the specified host and port (or Unix-domain socket) from the remote  machine.   For  a
               TCP  port,  the  first  argument  must  be [<u>bind_address</u>:]<u>port</u> or a Unix domain socket path.  The
               second argument is the destination and may be <u>host</u>:<u>hostport</u> or a Unix domain socket path  if  the
               remote host supports it.

               IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing addresses in square brackets.

               If  either  argument  contains  a  '/'  in it, that argument will be interpreted as a Unix-domain
               socket (on the corresponding host) rather than a TCP port.

               Multiple forwardings may be specified, and additional forwardings can be  given  on  the  command
               line.   Only  the superuser can forward privileged ports.  By default, the local port is bound in
               accordance with the <b>GatewayPorts</b> setting.  However, an explicit <u>bind_address</u> may be used to  bind
               the connection to a specific address.  The <u>bind_address</u> of <b>localhost</b> indicates that the listening
               port be bound for local use only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates that the port should be
               available  from  all  interfaces.   Unix  domain socket paths may use the tokens described in the
               “TOKENS” section and environment variables as described in the “ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES” section.

       <b>LogLevel</b>
               Gives the verbosity level that is used when logging messages from <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).   The  possible  values
               are: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.  The default is INFO.
               DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent.  DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher levels of verbose output.

       <b>LogVerbose</b>
               Specify  one  or  more  overrides to LogLevel.  An override consists of one or more pattern lists
               that matches the source file, function and line  number  to  force  detailed  logging  for.   For
               example, an override pattern of:

                     kex.c:*:1000,*:kex_exchange_identification():*,packet.c:*

               would    enable    detailed    logging    for   line   1000   of   <u>kex.c</u>,   everything   in   the
               <b>kex_exchange_identification</b>() function, and all code  in  the  <u>packet.c</u>  file.   This  option  is
               intended for debugging and no overrides are enabled by default.

       <b>MACs</b>    Specifies  the  MAC  (message  authentication  code)  algorithms in order of preference.  The MAC
               algorithm is used for data integrity protection.  Multiple algorithms  must  be  comma-separated.
               If the specified list begins with a ‘+’ character, then the specified algorithms will be appended
               to the default set instead of replacing them.  If the specified list begins with a ‘-’ character,
               then  the specified algorithms (including wildcards) will be removed from the default set instead
               of replacing them.  If the specified list  begins  with  a  ‘^’  character,  then  the  specified
               algorithms will be placed at the head of the default set.

               The  algorithms that contain "-etm" calculate the MAC after encryption (encrypt-then-mac).  These
               are considered safer and their use recommended.

               The default is:

                     <a href="mailto:umac-64-etm@openssh.com">umac-64-etm@openssh.com</a>,<a href="mailto:umac-128-etm@openssh.com">umac-128-etm@openssh.com</a>,

                     hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha1

               The list of available MAC algorithms may also be obtained using "ssh -Q mac".

       <b>NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost</b>
               Disable host authentication for localhost (loopback addresses).  The  argument  to  this  keyword
               must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).

       <b>NumberOfPasswordPrompts</b>
               Specifies  the number of password prompts before giving up.  The argument to this keyword must be
               an integer.  The default is 3.

       <b>ObscureKeystrokeTiming</b>
               Specifies whether <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) should try to obscure inter-keystroke timings from passive observers  of
               network traffic.  If enabled, then for interactive sessions, <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) will send keystrokes at fixed
               intervals  of a few tens of milliseconds and will send fake keystroke packets for some time after
               typing ceases.  The argument to this keyword must be <b>yes</b>, <b>no</b> or an interval specifier of the form
               <b>interval:milliseconds</b> (e.g.  <b>interval:80</b>  for  80  milliseconds).   The  default  is  to  obscure
               keystrokes  using a 20ms packet interval.  Note that smaller intervals will result in higher fake
               keystroke packet rates.

       <b>PasswordAuthentication</b>
               Specifies whether to use password authentication.  The argument to this keyword must be <b>yes</b>  (the
               default) or <b>no</b>.

       <b>PermitLocalCommand</b>
               Allow  local  command execution via the <b>LocalCommand</b> option or using the <b>!</b><u>command</u> escape sequence
               in <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).  The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).

       <b>PermitRemoteOpen</b>
               Specifies the destinations to which remote TCP port forwarding is permitted when <b>RemoteForward</b> is
               used as a SOCKS proxy.  The forwarding specification must be one of the following forms:

                     <b>PermitRemoteOpen</b> <u>host</u>:<u>port</u>
                     <b>PermitRemoteOpen</b> <u>IPv4_addr</u>:<u>port</u>
                     <b>PermitRemoteOpen</b> <u>[IPv6_addr]</u>:<u>port</u>

               Multiple forwards may be specified by separating them with whitespace.  An argument of <b>any</b> can be
               used to remove all restrictions and permit any forwarding requests.  An argument of <b>none</b>  can  be
               used to prohibit all forwarding requests.  The wildcard ‘*’ can be used for host or port to allow
               all hosts or ports respectively.  Otherwise, no pattern matching or address lookups are performed
               on supplied names.

       <b>PKCS11Provider</b>
               Specifies  which PKCS#11 provider to use or <b>none</b> to indicate that no provider should be used (the
               default).  The argument to this keyword is a path to the PKCS#11 shared library <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) should use
               to communicate with a PKCS#11 token providing keys for user authentication.

       <b>Port</b>    Specifies the port number to connect on the remote host.  The default is 22.

       <b>PreferredAuthentications</b>
               Specifies the order in which the client should try authentication methods.  This allows a  client
               to  prefer  one  method  (e.g.  <b>keyboard-interactive</b>)  over  another method (e.g. <b>password</b>).  The
               default is:

                     gssapi-with-mic,hostbased,publickey,
                     keyboard-interactive,password

       <b>ProxyCommand</b>
               Specifies the command to use to connect to the server.  The command string extends to the end  of
               the  line,  and  is  executed  using the user's shell ‘exec’ directive to avoid a lingering shell
               process.

               Arguments to <b>ProxyCommand</b> accept the tokens described in the “TOKENS” section.  The  command  can
               be  basically anything, and should read from its standard input and write to its standard output.
               It should eventually connect an <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) server running  on  some  machine,  or  execute  <b>sshd</b>  <b>-i</b>
               somewhere.   Host  key  management  will  be  done using the <b>Hostname</b> of the host being connected
               (defaulting to the name typed by the user).  Setting the command to  <b>none</b>  disables  this  option
               entirely.  Note that <b>CheckHostIP</b> is not available for connects with a proxy command.

               This  directive  is  useful  in  conjunction  with <u><a href="../man1/nc.1.html">nc</a></u>(1) and its proxy support.  For example, the
               following directive would connect via an HTTP proxy at 192.0.2.0:

                  ProxyCommand <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?nc">/usr/bin/nc</a> -X connect -x 192.0.2.0:8080 %h %p

       <b>ProxyJump</b>
               Specifies one or more jump proxies as either [<u>user</u>@]<u>host</u>[:<u>port</u>] or an ssh URI.  Multiple  proxies
               may  be separated by comma characters and will be visited sequentially.  Setting this option will
               cause <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) to connect to the target host by first making a <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) connection to  the  specified
               <b>ProxyJump</b> host and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate target from there.  Setting
               the host to <b>none</b> disables this option entirely.

               Note  that  this  option will compete with the <b>ProxyCommand</b> option - whichever is specified first
               will prevent later instances of the other from taking effect.

               Note also that the configuration for the destination host (either supplied via  the  command-line
               or  the configuration file) is not generally applied to jump hosts.  <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/config">~/.ssh/config</a></u> should be used
               if specific configuration is required for jump hosts.

       <b>ProxyUseFdpass</b>
               Specifies that <b>ProxyCommand</b> will pass a connected file  descriptor  back  to  <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)  instead  of
               continuing to execute and pass data.  The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms</b>
               Specifies  the  signature  algorithms that will be used for public key authentication as a comma-
               separated list of patterns.  If the  specified  list  begins  with  a  ‘+’  character,  then  the
               algorithms  after  it  will be appended to the default instead of replacing it.  If the specified
               list begins with a ‘-’ character, then the specified algorithms  (including  wildcards)  will  be
               removed  from the default set instead of replacing them.  If the specified list begins with a ‘^’
               character, then the specified algorithms will be placed at the head  of  the  default  set.   The
               default for this option is:

               The   list   of   available   signature   algorithms   may   also   be  obtained  using  "ssh  -Q
               PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms".

       <b>PubkeyAuthentication</b>
               Specifies whether to try public key authentication.  The argument to this  keyword  must  be  <b>yes</b>
               (the default), <b>no</b>, <b>unbound</b> or <b>host-bound</b>.  The final two options enable public key authentication
               while respectively disabling or enabling the OpenSSH host-bound authentication protocol extension
               required for restricted <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1) forwarding.

       <b>RekeyLimit</b>
               Specifies  the  maximum amount of data that may be transmitted or received before the session key
               is renegotiated, optionally followed by a maximum amount of time that may pass before the session
               key is renegotiated.  The first argument is specified in bytes and may have a suffix of ‘K’, ‘M’,
               or ‘G’ to indicate Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively.  The default is between ‘1G’
               and ‘4G’, depending on the cipher.  The optional second value is specified in seconds and may use
               any of the units documented in the TIME FORMATS section of <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5).  The default value for
               <b>RekeyLimit</b> is <b>default</b> <b>none</b>, which means that rekeying is performed  after  the  cipher's  default
               amount of data has been sent or received and no time based rekeying is done.

       <b>RemoteCommand</b>
               Specifies a command to execute on the remote machine after successfully connecting to the server.
               The  command  string  extends  to  the  end  of  the line, and is executed with the user's shell.
               Arguments to <b>RemoteCommand</b> accept the tokens described in the “TOKENS” section.

       <b>RemoteForward</b>
               Specifies that a TCP port or Unix-domain socket on the  remote  machine  be  forwarded  over  the
               secure  channel.   The  remote port may either be forwarded to a specified host and port or Unix-
               domain socket from the local machine, or may act as a SOCKS 4/5 proxy that allows a remote client
               to connect to arbitrary destinations from the local machine.  The first argument is the listening
               specification and may be [<u>bind_address</u>:]<u>port</u> or, if the remote host supports it,  a  Unix  domain
               socket  path.   If  forwarding  to  a  specific  destination  then  the  second  argument must be
               <u>host</u>:<u>hostport</u> or a Unix domain socket path, otherwise if no  destination  argument  is  specified
               then  the  remote forwarding will be established as a SOCKS proxy.  When acting as a SOCKS proxy,
               the destination of the connection can be restricted by <b>PermitRemoteOpen</b>.

               IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing addresses in square brackets.

               If either argument contains a '/' in it, that argument  will  be  interpreted  as  a  Unix-domain
               socket (on the corresponding host) rather than a TCP port.

               Multiple  forwardings  may  be  specified, and additional forwardings can be given on the command
               line.  Privileged ports can be forwarded only when logging in as  root  on  the  remote  machine.
               Unix  domain  socket  paths  may use the tokens described in the “TOKENS” section and environment
               variables as described in the “ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES” section.

               If the <u>port</u> argument is 0, the listen port will  be  dynamically  allocated  on  the  server  and
               reported to the client at run time.

               If  the <u>bind_address</u> is not specified, the default is to only bind to loopback addresses.  If the
               <u>bind_address</u> is ‘*’ or an empty string, then  the  forwarding  is  requested  to  listen  on  all
               interfaces.   Specifying  a  remote  <u>bind_address</u>  will only succeed if the server's <b>GatewayPorts</b>
               option is enabled (see <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5)).

       <b>RequestTTY</b>
               Specifies whether to request a pseudo-tty for the session.  The argument may be one of: <b>no</b> (never
               request a TTY), <b>yes</b> (always request a TTY when standard input is a TTY), <b>force</b> (always request  a
               TTY)  or  <b>auto</b>  (request  a TTY when opening a login session).  This option mirrors the <b>-t</b> and <b>-T</b>
               flags for <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).

       <b>RequiredRSASize</b>
               Specifies the minimum RSA key size (in bits) that <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) will accept.  User  authentication  keys
               smaller  than this limit will be ignored.  Servers that present host keys smaller than this limit
               will cause the connection to be terminated.  The default is <b>1024</b> bits.  Note that this limit  may
               only be raised from the default.

       <b>RevokedHostKeys</b>
               Specifies  revoked  host  public  keys.   Keys  listed  in  this  file  will  be refused for host
               authentication.  Note  that  if  this  file  does  not  exist  or  is  not  readable,  then  host
               authentication  will be refused for all hosts.  Keys may be specified as a text file, listing one
               public key per line, or as an OpenSSH Key Revocation List (KRL) as  generated  by  <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></u>(1).
               For  more  information on KRLs, see the KEY REVOCATION LISTS section in <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></u>(1).  Arguments
               to <b>RevokedHostKeys</b> may use the tilde syntax to refer to  a  user's  home  directory,  the  tokens
               described  in  the  “TOKENS”  section  and environment variables as described in the “ENVIRONMENT
               VARIABLES” section.

       <b>SecurityKeyProvider</b>
               Specifies a path to a library that will be used when loading any FIDO authenticator-hosted  keys,
               overriding the default of using the built-in USB HID support.

               If  the  specified  value  begins with a ‘$’ character, then it will be treated as an environment
               variable containing the path to the library.

       <b>SendEnv</b>
               Specifies what variables from the local <u><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></u>(7) should be sent to the server.  The server must
               also support it, and the server must be configured to accept these environment  variables.   Note
               that  the  TERM environment variable is always sent whenever a pseudo-terminal is requested as it
               is required by the protocol.  Refer to <b>AcceptEnv</b> in  <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5)  for  how  to  configure  the
               server.   Variables  are  specified  by  name,  which  may contain wildcard characters.  Multiple
               environment  variables  may  be  separated  by  whitespace  or  spread  across  multiple  <b>SendEnv</b>
               directives.

               See “PATTERNS” for more information on patterns.

               It  is possible to clear previously set <b>SendEnv</b> variable names by prefixing patterns with <u>-</u>.  The
               default is not to send any environment variables.

       <b>ServerAliveCountMax</b>
               Sets the number of server alive messages (see below) which may be sent without  <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)  receiving
               any  messages back from the server.  If this threshold is reached while server alive messages are
               being sent, ssh will disconnect from the server, terminating the session.   It  is  important  to
               note  that  the  use  of  server alive messages is very different from <b>TCPKeepAlive</b> (below).  The
               server alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable.
               The TCP keepalive option enabled by <b>TCPKeepAlive</b> is spoofable.  The  server  alive  mechanism  is
               valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.

               The  default  value  is  3.   If,  for  example, <b>ServerAliveInterval</b> (see below) is set to 15 and
               <b>ServerAliveCountMax</b> is left at  the  default,  if  the  server  becomes  unresponsive,  ssh  will
               disconnect after approximately 45 seconds.

       <b>ServerAliveInterval</b>
               Sets  a  timeout  interval  in  seconds after which if no data has been received from the server,
               <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from  the  server.
               The  default  is  0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the server, or 300 if the
               <b>BatchMode</b> option is set (Debian-specific).  <b>ProtocolKeepAlives</b> is a Debian-specific compatibility
               alias for this option.

       <b>SessionType</b>
               May be used to either request invocation of a subsystem on the remote system, or to  prevent  the
               execution  of  a  remote  command  at  all.  The latter is useful for just forwarding ports.  The
               argument to this keyword must be <b>none</b> (same as the <b>-N</b> option), <b>subsystem</b> (same as the <b>-s</b>  option)
               or <b>default</b> (shell or command execution).

       <b>SetEnv</b>  Directly specify one or more environment variables and their contents to be sent to the server in
               the form “NAME=VALUE”.  Similarly to <b>SendEnv</b>, with the exception of the TERM variable, the server
               must be prepared to accept the environment variable.

               The  “VALUE”  may  use  the tokens described in the “TOKENS” section and environment variables as
               described in the “ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES” section.

       <b>StdinNull</b>
               Redirects stdin from <u>/dev/null</u> (actually, prevents reading  from  stdin).   Either  this  or  the
               equivalent  <b>-n</b>  option  must  be  used  when  <b>ssh</b> is run in the background.  The argument to this
               keyword must be <b>yes</b> (same as the <b>-n</b> option) or <b>no</b> (the default).

       <b>StreamLocalBindMask</b>
               Sets the octal file creation mode mask (umask) used when creating a Unix-domain socket  file  for
               local  or  remote port forwarding.  This option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain
               socket file.

               The default value is 0177, which creates a Unix-domain socket file that is readable and  writable
               only by the owner.  Note that not all operating systems honor the file mode on Unix-domain socket
               files.

       <b>StreamLocalBindUnlink</b>
               Specifies  whether  to  remove  an  existing  Unix-domain  socket  file  for local or remote port
               forwarding  before  creating  a   new   one.    If   the   socket   file   already   exists   and
               <b>StreamLocalBindUnlink</b>  is  not enabled, <b>ssh</b> will be unable to forward the port to the Unix-domain
               socket file.  This option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.

               The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).

       <b>StrictHostKeyChecking</b>
               If  this  flag  is  set  to  <b>yes</b>,  <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)  will  never  automatically  add  host  keys   to   the
               <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a></u>  file,  and  refuses  to  connect  to  hosts whose host key has changed.  This
               provides maximum protection against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, though it can  be  annoying
               when  the <u>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</u> file is poorly maintained or when connections to new hosts are
               frequently made.  This option forces the user to manually add all new hosts.

               If this flag is set to <b>accept-new</b> then ssh will automatically add new host  keys  to  the  user's
               <u>known_hosts</u>  file, but will not permit connections to hosts with changed host keys.  If this flag
               is set to <b>no</b> or <b>off</b>, ssh will automatically add new host keys to the user known hosts  files  and
               allow  connections  to  hosts with changed hostkeys to proceed, subject to some restrictions.  If
               this flag is set to <b>ask</b> (the default), new host keys will be added to the user known  host  files
               only  after  the  user  has confirmed that is what they really want to do, and ssh will refuse to
               connect to hosts whose host key has changed.  The host keys  of  known  hosts  will  be  verified
               automatically in all cases.

       <b>SyslogFacility</b>
               Gives the facility code that is used when logging messages from <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).  The possible values are:
               DAEMON,  USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2, LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7.  The default
               is USER.

       <b>TCPKeepAlive</b>
               Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the other side.  If  they  are
               sent,  death  of  the  connection or crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed.  This
               option only uses TCP keepalives (as opposed to using ssh level keepalives), so takes a long  time
               to notice when the connection dies.  As such, you probably want the <b>ServerAliveInterval</b> option as
               well.   However,  this means that connections will die if the route is down temporarily, and some
               people find it annoying.

               The default is <b>yes</b> (to send TCP keepalive messages), and the client will notice  if  the  network
               goes down or the remote host dies.  This is important in scripts, and many users want it too.

               To  disable  TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to <b>no</b>.  See also <b>ServerAliveInterval</b>
               for protocol-level keepalives.

       <b>Tag</b>     Specify a configuration tag name that may be later used by a <b>Match</b> directive to select a block of
               configuration.

       <b>Tunnel</b>  Request <u><a href="../man4/tun.4.html">tun</a></u>(4) device forwarding between the client and the server.  The argument  must  be  <b>yes</b>,
               <b>point-to-point</b>  (layer  3), <b>ethernet</b> (layer 2), or <b>no</b> (the default).  Specifying <b>yes</b> requests the
               default tunnel mode, which is <b>point-to-point</b>.

       <b>TunnelDevice</b>
               Specifies the <u><a href="../man4/tun.4.html">tun</a></u>(4) devices to open on the client (<u>local_tun</u>) and the server (<u>remote_tun</u>).

               The argument must be <u>local_tun</u>[:<u>remote_tun</u>].  The devices may be specified by numerical ID or the
               keyword <b>any</b>, which uses the next available tunnel device.  If <u>remote_tun</u>  is  not  specified,  it
               defaults to <b>any</b>.  The default is <b>any:any</b>.

       <b>UpdateHostKeys</b>
               Specifies  whether <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) should accept notifications of additional hostkeys from the server sent
               after authentication has completed and add them to <b>UserKnownHostsFile</b>.  The argument must be <b>yes</b>,
               <b>no</b> or <b>ask</b>.  This option allows learning alternate hostkeys for a server and supports graceful key
               rotation by allowing a server to send replacement public keys before old ones are removed.

               Additional hostkeys are only accepted if the key  used  to  authenticate  the  host  was  already
               trusted  or  explicitly  accepted  by the user, the host was authenticated via <b>UserKnownHostsFile</b>
               (i.e. not <b>GlobalKnownHostsFile</b>) and the host was authenticated  using  a  plain  key  and  not  a
               certificate.

               <b>UpdateHostKeys</b>   is   enabled   by   default   if   the  user  has  not  overridden  the  default
               <b>UserKnownHostsFile</b> setting and has not enabled <b>VerifyHostKeyDNS</b>, otherwise <b>UpdateHostKeys</b> will be
               set to <b>no</b>.

               If <b>UpdateHostKeys</b> is set to <b>ask</b>, then the user is asked  to  confirm  the  modifications  to  the
               known_hosts  file.   Confirmation  is  currently  incompatible  with  <b>ControlPersist</b>, and will be
               disabled if it is enabled.

               Presently, only <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) from OpenSSH 6.8 and greater support the "<a href="mailto:hostkeys@openssh.com">hostkeys@openssh.com</a>"  protocol
               extension used to inform the client of all the server's hostkeys.

       <b>User</b>    Specifies  the  user  to  log  in  as.   This can be useful when a different user name is used on
               different machines.  This saves the trouble of having to remember to give the user  name  on  the
               command  line.   Arguments to <b>User</b> may use the tokens described in the “TOKENS” section (with the
               exception of %r and %C) and environment variables as described  in  the  “ENVIRONMENT  VARIABLES”
               section.

       <b>UserKnownHostsFile</b>
               Specifies one or more files to use for the user host key database, separated by whitespace.  Each
               filename  may  use  tilde notation to refer to the user's home directory, the tokens described in
               the “TOKENS” section and environment  variables  as  described  in  the  “ENVIRONMENT  VARIABLES”
               section.   A  value  of  <b>none</b>  causes  <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) to ignore any user-specific known hosts files.  The
               default is <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a></u>, <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts2">~/.ssh/known_hosts2</a></u>.

       <b>VerifyHostKeyDNS</b>
               Specifies whether to verify the remote key using DNS and SSHFP resource records.  If this  option
               is  set  to  <b>yes</b>, the client will implicitly trust keys that match a secure fingerprint from DNS.
               Insecure fingerprints will be handled as if this option was set to <b>ask</b>.  If this option is set to
               <b>ask</b>, information on fingerprint match will be displayed, but the user will still need to  confirm
               new host keys according to the <b>StrictHostKeyChecking</b> option.  The default is <b>no</b>.

               See also “VERIFYING HOST KEYS” in <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).

       <b>VersionAddendum</b>
               Optionally specifies additional text to append to the SSH protocol banner sent by the client upon
               connection.  The default is <b>none</b>.

       <b>VisualHostKey</b>
               If  this  flag  is  set to <b>yes</b>, an ASCII art representation of the remote host key fingerprint is
               printed in addition to the fingerprint string at login and for unknown host keys.  If  this  flag
               is  set to <b>no</b> (the default), no fingerprint strings are printed at login and only the fingerprint
               string will be printed for unknown host keys.

       <b>XAuthLocation</b>
               Specifies the full pathname of the <u><a href="../man1/xauth.1.html">xauth</a></u>(1) program.  The default is <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?xauth">/usr/bin/xauth</a></u>.

</pre><h4><b>PATTERNS</b></h4><pre>
       A <u>pattern</u> consists of zero or more non-whitespace characters, ‘*’ (a wildcard that matches zero  or  more
       characters),  or  ‘?’  (a wildcard that matches exactly one character).  For example, to specify a set of
       declarations for any host in the ".co.uk" set of domains, the following pattern could be used:

             <b>Host</b> <b>*.co.uk</b>

       The following pattern would match any host in the 192.168.0.[0-9] network range:

             <b>Host</b> <b>192.168.0.?</b>

       A <u>pattern-list</u> is a comma-separated list of patterns.  Patterns within pattern-lists may  be  negated  by
       preceding  them  with  an  exclamation  mark (‘!’).  For example, to allow a key to be used from anywhere
       within an organization except from the "dialup" pool, the following entry (in authorized_keys)  could  be
       used:

             <b>from="!*.dialup.example.com,*.example.com"</b>

       Note  that  a  negated  match will never produce a positive result by itself.  For example, attempting to
       match "host3" against the following pattern-list will fail:

             <b>from="!host1,!host2"</b>

       The solution here is to include a term that will yield a positive match, such as a wildcard:

             <b>from="!host1,!host2,*"</b>

</pre><h4><b>TOKENS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to some keywords can make use of tokens, which are expanded at runtime:

             %%    A literal ‘%’.
             %C    Hash of %l%h%p%r%j.
             %d    Local user's home directory.
             %f    The fingerprint of the server's host key.
             %H    The <u>known_hosts</u> hostname or address that is being searched for.
             %h    The remote hostname.
             %I    A string describing the reason for a <b>KnownHostsCommand</b> execution: either <b>ADDRESS</b> when looking
                   up a host by address (only when <b>CheckHostIP</b> is enabled), <b>HOSTNAME</b> when searching by hostname,
                   or <b>ORDER</b> when preparing the host key algorithm preference list to  use  for  the  destination
                   host.
             %i    The local user ID.
             %j    The contents of the ProxyJump option, or the empty string if this option is unset.
             %K    The base64 encoded host key.
             %k    The  host key alias if specified, otherwise the original remote hostname given on the command
                   line.
             %L    The local hostname.
             %l    The local hostname, including the domain name.
             %n    The original remote hostname, as given on the command line.
             %p    The remote port.
             %r    The remote username.
             %T    The local <u><a href="../man4/tun.4.html">tun</a></u>(4) or <u><a href="../man4/tap.4.html">tap</a></u>(4) network interface assigned if tunnel forwarding was requested,  or
                   "NONE" otherwise.
             %t    The type of the server host key, e.g.  <b>ssh-ed25519</b>.
             %u    The local username.

       <b>CertificateFile</b>,  <b>ControlPath</b>,  <b>IdentityAgent</b>,  <b>IdentityFile</b>,  <b>Include</b>,  <b>KnownHostsCommand</b>, <b>LocalForward</b>,
       <b>Match</b> <b>exec</b>, <b>RemoteCommand</b>, <b>RemoteForward</b>, <b>RevokedHostKeys</b>, <b>UserKnownHostsFile</b> and <b>VersionAddendum</b>  accept
       the tokens %%, %C, %d, %h, %i, %j, %k, %L, %l, %n, %p, %r, and %u.

       <b>KnownHostsCommand</b> additionally accepts the tokens %f, %H, %I, %K and %t.

       <b>Hostname</b> accepts the tokens %% and %h.

       <b>LocalCommand</b> accepts all tokens.

       <b>ProxyCommand</b> and <b>ProxyJump</b> accept the tokens %%, %h, %n, %p, and %r.

       Note  that  some of these directives build commands for execution via the shell.  Because <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) performs
       no filtering or escaping of characters that have special meaning in shell commands (e.g. quotes),  it  is
       the  user's  responsibility  to ensure that the arguments passed to <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) do not contain such characters
       and that tokens are appropriately quoted when used.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to some keywords can be expanded at  runtime  from  environment  variables  on  the  client  by
       enclosing them in <b>${}</b>, for example <b>${HOME}/.ssh</b> would refer to the user's .ssh directory.  If a specified
       environment  variable does not exist then an error will be returned and the setting for that keyword will
       be ignored.

       The keywords <b>CertificateFile</b>, <b>ControlPath</b>, <b>IdentityAgent</b>, <b>IdentityFile</b>, <b>Include</b>,  <b>KnownHostsCommand</b>,  and
       <b>UserKnownHostsFile</b>  support  environment  variables.  The keywords <b>LocalForward</b> and <b>RemoteForward</b> support
       environment variables only for Unix domain socket paths.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/config">~/.ssh/config</a></u>
               This is the per-user configuration file.  The format of this file is described above.  This  file
               is  used  by  the  SSH  client.   Because  of the potential for abuse, this file must have strict
               permissions: read/write for the user, and not writable  by  others.   It  may  be  group-writable
               provided that the group in question contains only the user.

       <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_config">/etc/ssh/ssh_config</a></u>
               Systemwide  configuration  file.   This  file  provides  defaults  for  those values that are not
               specified in the user's configuration file, and for those users who do not have  a  configuration
               file.  This file must be world-readable.
