</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cfingerd.conf - configurable finger daemon configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/cfingerd.conf</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>cfingerd.conf</u>  is  the configuration file for cfingerd.  <b>cfingerd</b> has been totally rewritten to support a
       more readable configuration file.  This version of the new configuration file is <b>NOT</b> compatible with  the
       older versions from 1.0.3 or below.

       The configuration file is split into sections of three general types: <b>FILES,</b> <b>CONFIG,</b> and <b>HOSTS.</b>

       Each one of those sections is split into subsections, which will be explained next.

       Subtext  of  each option is either boolean options, string options, or switchable options, all changeable
       by the system administrator.

       Each section is split into a series of sections that resembles C type definition; not  exact,  but  close
       enough to be familiar with it.  :) There's only one exception - these are not case sensitive.  Any casing
       will do, as long as the option is legal.

       Thus, each section is formatted like this:

            OPTION section_name = {
              (tab/space) string_option = "string_format",
              (tab/space) +/-boolean_pair_option = [BOOL, BOOL],
              (tab/space) +/-internal_config_option
              (tab/space) host.name.here
            }

       This illustrates that string options are strings put into "quotes", boolean options are given as TRUE and
       FALSE,  switchable  options are given with the + or - directive, and hostnames are used as substrings, so
       that wildcards are not necessary.

       A few sections simply contain a block of text to be used as the value of a single option,  which  one  is
       indicated by the section name itself.

       You  may  add  comments  using  the  hash  mark  ``#'' at the beginning of the line.  Please note that no
       comments are allowed inside of a section.

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAY</b> <b>FILES</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>(FILES</b> <b>display_files)</b></h4><pre>
       Each option here is a string option.  The first 6 options are relative to the home directory of  whatever
       user was fingered, the remaining are absolute and should start with a "/".

       <b>PLAN</b>  is  the  optional  plan  file  which contains the text displayed as the users plan.  The default is
       <u>.plan</u>.

       <b>PROJECT</b> is the optional project file that is used when displaying a project  description.   The  standard
       here is <u>.project</u>.

       <b>PGP_KEY</b> is the optional "Pretty-Good-Privacy" file that is shown when displaying a public or private key.
       The standard here is <u>.pgpkey</u>.

       <b>XFACE</b>  is the optional file that shows the user's face.  (This is commonly used in E-Mail messages.)  The
       standard here is <u>.xface</u>.

       <b>NO_FINGER</b> is the optional file that is shown when a user wishes to remain anonymous.  This is usually the
       case with root users (which should be standard, anyway).  In order to hide the user this file  should  be
       an  exact  copy  of the nouser_banner.txt file.  The standard here is <u>.nofinger</u>.  This file can only be a
       standard displayable file.  This option will also hide the user from a "search.pattern"  query.   If  any
       user  can  read  this  file  it will also be honored by a userlist (@host) query.  This is done by a non-
       priviliged program so the uid can't be changed.

       <b>USERLOG</b> is the optional file in which all attempts to  finger  a  user  are  logged  for  the  users  own
       reference.     If    ALLOW_USERLOG    is   not   enabled   this   file   is   completely   ignored.    If
       ONLY_CREATE_FINGERLOG_IF_FILE_EXISTS is enabled <b>cfingerd</b> will only document finger requests if this  file
       already exists in the users home directory.  The default name is <u>.fingerlog</u>.

       <b>MAILBOX</b>  is the file that is checked to see where the user's mailbox is.  If you are using a regular Unix
       mail transport agent (such as <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/smail.1.html">smail</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/exim.1.html">exim</a></b>(1)),<b>you</b>would<b>use</b>  <u>/usr/spool/mail/$USER</u>  here.
       If  you  are  using something like qmail, you would use <u>$HOME/Mailbox</u>.  The path must be given as well as
       the filename to check for.  <u>$USER</u> will expand to the proper username.  <u>$HOME</u> will expand  to  the  proper
       home  directory for that very user.  If <b>MAILBOX</b> is set to``QMAIL'' cfingerd assumes that Qmail is used on
       the local system and therefore will read <u><a href="file:~/.qmail">~/.qmail</a></u> files instead of common mailbox files.

       <b>LOGFILE</b> is the file that is used to keep logs of everything that happens to your finger  program.   These
       logs  are  kept  as  backups  for your finger file, and can be used to guard against attacks against your
       system if a finger attack occurs.  By keeping <u>cfingerd.conf</u> readable only by root the logfile  should  be
       kept in a safe, hidden place.

       <b>HEADER_DISPLAY</b>  is  the  file  that  is  displayed at the top of each finger reply.  The standard here is
       <u>/etc/cfingerd/top_finger.txt</u>.

       <b>FOOTER_DISPLAY</b> is the file that is displayed at the end of each  finger  reply.   The  standard  here  is
       <u>/etc/cfingerd/bottom_finger.txt</u>.

       <b>NO_USER_BANNER</b>  is  the  file  that  is  displayed  if  the  user  doesn't  exist.   The standard here is
       <u>/etc/cfingerd/nouser_banner.txt</u>.

       <b>NO_NAME_BANNER</b> is the file that is displayed if no name was specified in a finger  request  if  a  system
       listing   is   not   allowed  by  the  <b>SYSTEM_LIST</b>  option  (explained  later).   The  standard  here  is
       <u>/etc/cfingerd/noname_banner.txt</u>.

       <b>REJECTED_BANNER</b> is the file that is displayed if a rejected host tries to  finger  your  system  for  any
       reason.  The standard here is <u>/etc/cfingerd/rejected_banner.txt</u>.

</pre><h4><b>FINGER</b> <b>DISPLAY</b> <b>CONFIGURE</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>(CONFIG</b> <b>finger_display)</b></h4><pre>
       Each  option  in this section is boolean.  The way this works is as follows:  The first boolean option is
       the setting for a remote host, or a host that fingers you from the outside.  The second boolean option is
       the setting for the local host, or trusted host.  This is what people from your own system will see.

       TRUE means that this item is included in  the  cfingerd  reply.   FALSE  means  it  is  omitted.   Unless
       otherwise specified these items only appear if an existing user is fingered.

       Each  option  has  a  "-" or "+" option.  This is for user-overridable options, which will be in the next
       release of <b>cfingerd</b>.  These will allow each user to manipulate if this information is displayed when that
       specific user is fingered.

       <b>HEADER_FILE</b> displays the header file at the beginning of each finger reply.

       <b>FOOTER_FILE</b> displays the footer file at the end of each finger reply.

       <b>LOGIN_ID</b> displays the login ID of that particular user.

       <b>REAL_NAME</b> displays the real name of that particular user.

       <b>DIRECTORY</b> displays the user's directory.

       <b>SHELL</b> displays the user's shell.

       <b>ROOM_NUMBER</b> displays the user's room number.

       <b>WORK_NUMBER</b> displays the user's work phone number.

       <b>HOME_NUMBER</b> displays the user's home phone number.

       <b>OTHER</b> displays the user's other information.

       <b>LAST_TIME_ON</b> displays the last time the user has logged into the fingered system.

       <b>IF_ONLINE</b> displays whether or not the user is currently logged into the fingered system.

       <b>TIME_MAIL_READ</b> displays the last time that the fingered user has read mail.

       <b>DAY_MAIL_READ</b> displays the last day that the fingered user read his/her mail.

       <b>ORIGINATION</b> displays the site from which the user logged in (if applicable.)

       <b>PLAN</b> displays the user's plan file.

       <b>PROJECT</b> displays the user's project file.

       <b>PGP</b> displays the user's Pretty-Good-Privacy key file.

       <b>XFACE</b> displays the user's XFACE file.

       <b>NO_NAME_BANNER</b> displays the banner if no username was given.

       <b>REJECTED_BANNER</b> displays the rejected  banner  file  if  the  site  fingering  your  system  was  in  the
       banned-site listing.

       <b>SYSTEM_LIST</b> displays the system list if one was requested.

       <b>NO_NAME</b> displays the NO_USER_BANNER file if no user was selected.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>CONFIG</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>(CONFIG</b> <b>internal_config)</b></h4><pre>
       Each item in this section is a switchable option.  This means that a "+" before the item enables it while
       a "-" before the item turns it off.

       <b>ALLOW_MULTIPLE_FINGER_DISPLAY</b>  tells  <b>cfingerd</b> to add the system finger information from the hosts listed
       in the system_list_sites instead of only the localhost.  This is useful when you have more than  one  ISP
       machine, located in different cities, or even states.

       <b>ALLOW_SEARCHABLE_FINGER</b>  allows  you  to let others outside of your system (or within it) to search for a
       specific username by using the "search.pattern" directive.

       <b>ALLOW_NO_IP_MATCH_FINGER</b> allows you to let sites finger your system if a hostname could not be matched to
       their IP address successfully.

       <b>ALLOW_USER_OVERRIDE</b> will allow your users to override specific options in the <b>FINGER</b> <b>DISPLAY</b> section that
       you enable.  This is not yet implemented.

       <b>ALLOW_USERLIST_ONLY</b> will allow other sites to get a shortened form of the "finger @hostname" response  by
       issuing  "finger  userlist-only@hostname".   The shortened form does not merge in other computers even if
       <b>ALLOW_MULTIPLE_FINGER_DISPLAY</b> is enabled, and omits the usual headers and footers.  This listing is  only
       available  if  the  remote  user  is  allowed to query for a regular system list, so <b>SYSTEM_LIST</b> from the
       finger_display section needs to be enabled, too.

       <b>ALLOW_FINGER_FORWARDING</b> will allow other sites to forward finger requests to a different machine  if  the
       user  could not be located on the current machine.  (In order to use this option, you <b>MUST</b> have the <b>HOSTS</b>
       <b>finger_forward</b> option set, and have other sites in there.)

       <b>ALLOW_STRICT_FORMATTING</b> makes the finger display remove all returns between display options.  This  makes
       the  finger display look horrible (as with GNU Finger or the other generic fingers) and makes your system
       look, well, "generic".  :)

       <b>ALLOW_VERBOSE_TIMESTAMPING</b> makes the timestamp that is  displayed  (at  any  place)  very  verbose.   For
       instance, where it used to say:

       On since Sat Aug 12 03:43PM (PDT)

       would now be shown as:

       On since Sat Aug 12, 1995 03:43PM (PDT)

       (Basically, ALLOW_VERBOSE_TIMESTAMPING just takes up more room on the display field.)

       <b>ALLOW_NONIDENT_ACCESS</b>  lets  <b>cfingerd</b>  also accept connections from sites that don't run the IDENT daemon
       (or RFC1413-compliant program.)  This is for security sake, and is a good measure against  unknown  users
       trying  to finger your system.  If this option is enabled, users that do not have identd running on their
       system (ala Windows users) will be able to finger your system.  Systems NOT running  identd  will  return
       "unknown" as the user ID, and will thusly not be permitted to finger a user on your system.

       <b>ALLOW_FINGER_LOGGING</b>  enables  <b>cfingerd</b> to use the <b>LOGFILE</b> file to store any logs of activity that happen
       to your system via finger.

       <b>ALLOW_LINE_PARSING</b> makes <b>cfingerd</b> parse each line of every display file (including the plan, project, and
       pgp files) for any cfingerd-specific "$" commands.  If any are found, cfingerd will parse these  commands
       and  display  correct information accordingly.  Otherwise, if this is turned off, the display will appear
       without parsed commands.

       <b>ALLOW_EXECUTION</b> will allow users to execute scripts in place of their <u>.plan</u>, <u>.project</u>,  and  <u>.pgp</u>  files.
       This  is used to display the standard output of another program directly to the screen of the user.  Keep
       in mind that this is a HUGE security risk, should you choose to use it.   It's  normally  suggested  that
       this  remain  off,  but  you  can  turn  it  on  if  necessary. Nevertheless these programs are called as
       nobody.nogroup as effective user (while the real user will still be root, but a called program  won't  be
       able to change this back).

       <b>ALLOW_FAKEUSER_FINGER</b>  turns  on  or  off the fake user option in <b>cfingerd</b>.  If you want fake users to be
       defined, and available to be fingered, you will want to enable this option.  This can be a security  risk
       in  some  instances if you allow for searchable fingers, and your script calls an execute routine on that
       variable...  But chances are, that'll never happen.

       <b>ALLOW_USERLOG</b> will allow users to keep track of who has fingered them, and at  what  time.   The  default
       name of this user logfile is <u>.fingerlog</u>.

       <b>ALLOW_CONFESSION</b>  enables  two  fakeusers  "help" and "version" that provide information about the system
       running.  Some people don't like that so you can turn it off.  When fingered the requestor will only  see
       the NO_USER_BANNER so he can't guess that the fakeuser is supported.

       <b>ONLY_SHOW_HEADERS_IF_FILE_EXISTS</b>  will  only  show  the header of the .plan, .project, etc. files if they
       exist.  If the file doesn't exist, the header will not be shown.  This saves space on the final output of
       the finger data.

       <b>ONLY_CREATE_FINGERLOG_IF_FILE_EXISTS</b> will only create a .fingerlog  file  in  the  fingered  user's  home
       directory  if  one exists (and is read/writable by the user.)  This is to cut down on hard drive space if
       they don't want a .fingerlog file.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>LIST</b> <b>SITES</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>(CONFIG</b> <b>system_list_sites)</b></h4><pre>
       This is just a series of hostnames that you want to finger  when  displaying  a  userlist  query  (finger
       @localhost) .  If you have more than one system that you want to show, simply put their hostnames in this
       list, separated on a line by itself.

       A  good  example of the way this works is this: If you have a separate ISP system that you are running on
       the side, say "chatlink.com", then I would change my configuration to say:

           CONFIG system_list_sites = {
                   chatlink.com,
                   localhost
           }

       Remember, if you are listing only a couple of sites, list the sites you will  want  to  have  listed  (in
       order)  first.   These  sites  are  required  to  run <b>cfingerd</b> as well and they must not be offline while
       fingering.  The ending entry <b>MUST</b> be the localhost, or the finger listing will not include your site.  If
       you include localhost anywhere else in the list, it will stop once it has reached the localhost entry, so
       remember to list it last!

       For the simple fact that I want to get a user listing  from  my  own  machine,  and  from  chatlink.com's
       system.   This  would  be automatically formatted nicely (ie. sorted and parsed) and would display on the
       screen in sorted order.  This program is usually used in tandem with the supplied <b><a href="../man1/userlist.1.html">userlist</a></b>(1) program.

       If no system list sites are specified, multiple system sites will not be specified.

</pre><h4><b>TRUSTED</b> <b>HOST</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>(HOSTS</b> <b>trusted)</b></h4><pre>
       This is a listing of the sites that you allow to finger your system exclusively,  giving  them  the  same
       access that your local users would get.  In other words, they are treated as "localhost" users.

       Each  site that you list in this section should be separated by using the "," character.  You can include
       up to 80 sites in this listing.

       Wildcards are supported in this section, and you may use them in the regex format as well.  Any wildcards
       with "*", "?", or any other regex wildcard matching character will work.  IP addresses  will  also  work.
       Hostnames are compared case insensitive.

</pre><h4><b>REJECTED</b> <b>HOST</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>(HOSTS</b> <b>rejected)</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  a  listing  of the sites that you do not allow to finger your system.  These sites don't get to
       finger anyone (or anything for that matter) on your system, regardless  of  what  they  try  to  do.   In
       essence, finger is cut off to those particular systems.

       Each  site that you list in this section should be separated by using the "," character.  You can include
       up to 80 sites in this listing.

       Wildcards are supported in this section, and you may use them in the regex format as well.  Any wildcards
       with "*", "?", or any other regex wildcard matching character will work.  IP addresses  will  also  work.
       Hostnames are compared case insensitive.

</pre><h4><b>FORWARDED</b> <b>HOST</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>(HOSTS</b> <b>finger_forward)</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  a  listing  of  sites  that  are  used  to  forward a finger query to when a finger request was
       processed, but that particular user was not found on the associated system.  It will  step  through  this
       listing,  and it will search for the user in question.  If the user could not be found, then it will step
       through to the next host, and the next, until it finds one.

       Each site that you list in this section should be separated by using the "," character.  You can  include
       up to 80 sites in this listing.

       Wildcards are supported in this section, and you may use them in the regex format as well.  Any wildcards
       with  "*",  "?",  or  any other regex wildcard matching character will work.  Hostnames are compared case
       insensitive.

       If you do not specify any forwarding sites in this section, finger forwarding will be disabled  for  your
       system.

</pre><h4><b>FINGER</b> <b>STRINGS</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>(CONFIG</b> <b>finger_strings)</b></h4><pre>
       Each  option  in  this  section  is a string that can be changed to fit your needs when displaying finger
       information.  These strings are limited to about 20 characters on the display.  (If you use more than 20,
       the finger display will end up looking strange.)

       <b>USER_NAME</b> is the string that is displayed when the user's username is shown.

       <b>REAL_NAME</b> is the string that is displayed when the user's real name is shown.

       <b>DIRECTORY</b> is the string that is displayed when the user's directory is shown.

       <b>SHELL</b> is the string that is displayed when the user's shell is shown.

       <b>ROOM_NUMBER</b> is the string that is displayed when the user's room number is shown.

       <b>WORK_NUMBER</b> is the string that is displayed when the user's work phone number is shown.

       <b>HOME_NUMBER</b> is the string that is displayed when the user's home phone number is shown.

       <b>OTHER</b> is the string that is displayed when the user's other display information is show.

       <b>PLAN</b> is the string that is displayed when the user's plan is shown.

       <b>PROJECT</b> is the string that is displayed when the user's project is shown.

       <b>PGPKEY</b> is the string that is displayed when the user's PGP Key is shown.

       <b>XFACE</b> is the string that is displayed when the user's XFACE file is shown.

       <b>NO_PLAN</b> is the string that is  displayed  if  the  user  doesn't  have  a  plan  file  to  show  you  and
       <b>ONLY_SHOW_HEADERS_IF_FILE_EXISTS</b> is not enabled.

       <b>NO_PROJECT</b>  is  the  string  that  is  displayed  if the user doesn't have a project file to show you and
       <b>ONLY_SHOW_HEADERS_IF_FILE_EXISTS</b> is not enabled.

       <b>NO_PGP</b> is the string that is displayed if the  user  doesn't  have  a  PGP  Key  file  to  show  you  and
       <b>ONLY_SHOW_HEADERS_IF_FILE_EXISTS</b> is not enabled.

       <b>NO_XFACE</b>  is  the  string  that  is  displayed  if  the  user  doesn't have an xface file to show you and
       <b>ONLY_SHOW_HEADERS_IF_FILE_EXISTS</b> is not enabled.

       <b>WAIT</b> is the string that is shown when the system gathers information from other sites for a user listing.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>STRINGS</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>(CONFIG</b> <b>internal_strings)</b></h4><pre>
       These strings are changeable, and can be  any  length  you  want  (within  reason).   These  strings  are
       concattenated into the syslogging display when the appropriate finger has been issued.  This section also
       includes error messages that may occur.

       <b>NO_IP_HOST</b>  is  shown  when  there  is  no  hostname  that matches the incoming IP address.  This usually
       indicates that either the site didn't register their IP address with the InterNIC,  or  they  are  coming
       from a hacked site.

       <b>RENICE_FATAL</b>  is  shown when the system failed to change the execution priority on the current process of
       cfingerd.

       <b>STDIN_EMPTY</b> is shown when the input buffer on the CFINGERD port is  empty.   (This  should  never  really
       happen; it's here for sanity.)

       <b>TRUSTED_HOST</b>  is  shown  when  a trusted host fingers your system.  If you do not specify a trusted host,
       cfingerd will insert "localhost" into this field.

       <b>REJECTED_HOST</b> is shown when a rejected host fingers your system.  If you do not specify a rejected  host,
       cfingerd will insert "0.0.0.0" into this field.

       <b>ROOT_FINGER</b> is shown when a user fingers root.

       <b>SERVICE_FINGER</b> is shown when a user requests fake user services from your system.

       <b>USER_LIST</b> is shown when a user requests a system user listing from your system.

       <b>FAKE_USER</b> is shown when a user fingers a fake user from your system.

       <b>WHOIS_USER</b>  is  shown when a user fingers a user with a "WHOIS" query.  (This option is not yet available
       at the time of this writing.)

       <b>FINGER_DENY</b> is shown when a user tries to finger with a forward request like  user@host1@host2.  This  is
       not supported as it could result in finger loops and lots of traffic.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNAL</b> <b>STRINGS</b> <b>CONFIGURE</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>(CONFIG</b> <b>signal_strings)</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  is used in changing the output that is given when a system crashes, or a signal is caught,
       and reported to the finger output.

</pre><h4><b>FINGER</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b> <b>FILES</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>(FILES</b> <b>finger_programs)</b></h4><pre>
       These are the programs that are called when a specific action is take on the finger display.

       <b>FINGER</b>  is the file that is used when a system user listing is requested from your machine.  This is used
       in the standard user list and in the sorted user list, so it is wise to use the standard here; this being
       <u>/usr/sbin/userlist</u>.

       <b>WHOIS</b> is the program that is used when a "whois" request is done on a specific user.  This  is  currently
       not used.

</pre><h4><b>FINGER</b> <b>FAKEUSERS</b> <b>FILES</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>(FILES</b> <b>finger_fakeusers)</b></h4><pre>
       These  are  the  ever-popular  fake  users that you can create on your system.  These users are ones that
       don't exist (and should not, for that matter.)  These are, instead, treated as normal scripts that can be
       called for your use.

       The format is as follows for fake users:
           "fake_username", "Script name", SEARCHBOOL, "script"
       where...

       <b>fake_username</b> is the name of the fake user you want to request.  Make sure that this is a user that  DOES
       NOT exist on your system.  Keep in mind that if you create a fake username, and that user already exists,
       the  fake username will be shown. If you prepend '-' before the username, the fake user will not be shown
       on the list of services.

       <b>Script</b> <b>name</b> is the standard name of your script.  This is used in the display of your services listing.

       <b>SEARCHBOOL</b> specifies whether or not parameters can be sent to that specific fake user.  If you decide  to
       use the SEARCHBOOL option (ie. TRUE in this case), the passed variables are:

         $1 - First passed option,
         $2 - Second passed option,
         $3 - Third passed option, and
         $4 - Fourth passed option.

       (If more than four options were passed to this, the request will be ignored, and an error message will be
       returned to the user that requested the finger request.)

       <b>script</b> is the location of your script.  It should be <b>chmod</b> <b>700</b> and readable only by root.

       If  you  do  not  specify any fake users, a fake user called "None" will be created.  This is a fake user
       that does nothing, and calls "/dev/null" for the script.

</pre><h4><b>SERVICES</b> <b>HEADER</b> <b>CONFIGURE</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>(CONFIG</b> <b>services_header)</b></h4><pre>
       This is the display that is given during a services finger.  It should be formatted the same way that you
       want it to display on the screen.

       When specifying the finger formatted options, you should specify them as C  formatted  strings  as  well,
       with the standard options.  This should always be given last in the display.

       An example of this would be:

                 Welcome to this system's services!

               User:     Service name:     Searchable:
             -------- -------------------- -----------
             %-8s %-20s %-s

       Where  this  would  display the above string.  Remember to keep the format string last, or a <b>SIGSEGV</b> will
       result.

</pre><h4><b>SERVICES</b> <b>POSITIONS</b> <b>CONFIGURE</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>(CONFIG</b> <b>services_positions)</b></h4><pre>
       This specifies where in the above display string that the information from a service listing  is  to  go.
       These numbers can be anywhere between 1 and 3.

       <b>USER</b> specifies the position of the username listing.

       <b>SERVICE</b> specifies the position of the service full-name listing.

       <b>SEARCH</b> specifies the position of the boolean search display.
