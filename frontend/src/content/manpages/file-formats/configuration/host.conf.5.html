       host.conf - resolver configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  file  <u><a href="file:/etc/host.conf">/etc/host.conf</a></u> contains configuration information specific to the resolver library.  It should
       contain one configuration keyword per line,  followed  by  appropriate  configuration  information.   The
       following keywords are recognized:

       <u>trim</u>   This  keyword may be listed more than once.  Each time it should be followed by a list of domains,
              separated by colons (':'), semicolons (';') or commas (','), with the leading dot.  When set,  the
              resolver  library  will  automatically  trim  the  given  domain name from the end of any hostname
              resolved via DNS.  This is intended for use with local hosts and  domains.   (Related  note:  <u>trim</u>
              will  not  affect hostnames gathered via NIS or the <b><a href="../man5/hosts.5.html">hosts</a></b>(5) file.  Care should be taken to ensure
              that the first hostname for each entry in the hosts file is fully  qualified  or  unqualified,  as
              appropriate for the local installation.)

       <u>multi</u>  Valid  values  are <u>on</u> and <u>off</u>.  If set to <u>on</u>, the resolver library will return all valid addresses
              for a host that appears in the <u><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></u> file, instead  of  only  the  first.   This  is  <u>off</u>  by
              default, as it may cause a substantial performance loss at sites with large hosts files.

       <u>reorder</u>
              Valid  values  are  <u>on</u>  and  <u>off</u>.  If set to <u>on</u>, the resolver library will attempt to reorder host
              addresses  so  that  local  addresses  (i.e.,  on  the  same  subnet)  are  listed  first  when  a
              <b><a href="../man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname</a></b>(3)  is  performed.  Reordering is done for all lookup methods.  The default value is
              <u>off</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables can be used  to  allow  users  to  override  the  behavior  which  is
       configured in <u><a href="file:/etc/host.conf">/etc/host.conf</a></u>:

       <b>RESOLV_HOST_CONF</b>
              If set, this variable points to a file that should be read instead of <u><a href="file:/etc/host.conf">/etc/host.conf</a></u>.

       <b>RESOLV_MULTI</b>
              Overrides the <u>multi</u> command.

       <b>RESOLV_REORDER</b>
              Overrides the <u>reorder</u> command.

       <b>RESOLV_ADD_TRIM_DOMAINS</b>
              A  list of domains, separated by colons (':'), semicolons (';'), or commas (','), with the leading
              dot, which will be added to the list of domains that should be trimmed.

       <b>RESOLV_OVERRIDE_TRIM_DOMAINS</b>
              A list of domains, separated by colons (':'), semicolons (';'), or commas (','), with the  leading
              dot, which will replace the list of domains that should be trimmed.  Overrides the <u>trim</u> command.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/etc/host.conf">/etc/host.conf</a></u>
              Resolver configuration file

       <u><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></u>
              Resolver configuration file

       <u><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></u>
              Local hosts database

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  differences exist compared to the original implementation.  A new command <u>spoof</u> and a new
       environment variable <b>RESOLV_SPOOF_CHECK</b> can take arguments like <u>off</u>, <u>nowarn</u>, and <u>warn</u>.  Line comments can
       appear anywhere and not only at the beginning of a line.

   <b>Historical</b>
       The <b><a href="../man5/nsswitch.conf.5.html">nsswitch.conf</a></b>(5) file is the modern way of controlling the order of host lookups.

       In glibc 2.4 and earlier, the following keyword is recognized:

       <u>order</u>  This keyword specifies how host lookups are to be performed.  It should be followed by one or more
              lookup methods, separated by commas.  Valid methods are <u>bind</u>, <u>hosts</u>, and <u>nis</u>.

       <b>RESOLV_SERV_ORDER</b>
              Overrides the <u>order</u> command.

       Since glibc 2.0.7, and up through glibc 2.24, the following keywords and environment variable  have  been
       recognized but never implemented:

       <u>nospoof</u>
              Valid  values are <u>on</u> and <u>off</u>.  If set to <u>on</u>, the resolver library will attempt to prevent hostname
              spoofing to enhance the security of <b>rlogin</b> and <b>rsh</b>.  It works as follows: after performing a  host
              address  lookup, the resolver library will perform a hostname lookup for that address.  If the two
              hostnames do not match, the query fails.  The default value is <u>off</u>.

       <u>spoofalert</u>
              Valid values are <u>on</u> and <u>off</u>.  If this option is set to <u>on</u> and the <u>nospoof</u> option is also set,  the
              resolver  library  will  log a warning of the error via the syslog facility.  The default value is
              <u>off</u>.

       <u>spoof</u>  Valid values are <u>off</u>, <u>nowarn</u>, and <u>warn</u>.  If this option is  set  to  <u>off</u>,  spoofed  addresses  are
              permitted and no warnings will be emitted via the syslog facility.  If this option is set to <u>warn</u>,
              the  resolver  library will attempt to prevent hostname spoofing to enhance the security and log a
              warning of the error via the syslog facility.  If this option  is  set  to  <u>nowarn</u>,  the  resolver
              library  will  attempt  to prevent hostname spoofing to enhance the security but not emit warnings
              via the syslog facility.  Setting this option to anything else is equal to setting it to <u>nowarn</u>.

       <b>RESOLV_SPOOF_CHECK</b>
              Overrides the <u>nospoof</u>, <u>spoofalert</u>, and <u>spoof</u> commands in the same way  as  the  <u>spoof</u>  command  is
              parsed.  Valid values are <u>off</u>, <u>nowarn</u>, and <u>warn</u>.
