</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/cachefilesd.conf - Local file caching configuration file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration  file  for  cachefilesd  which  can manage a persistent cache for a variety of network
       filesystems using a set of files on an already mounted filesystem as the data store.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This configuration file can contain a number of commands.  Each one should be on a separate line.   Blank
       lines and lines beginning with a '#' character are considered to be comments and are discarded.

       The only mandatory command is:

       <b>dir</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
              This command specifies the directory containing the root of the cache.  It may only specified once
              per configuration file.

       All the other commands are optional:

       <b>secctx</b> <b>&lt;label&gt;</b>
              Specify  an  LSM security context as which the kernel will perform operations to access the cache.
              The default is to use cachefilesd's security context.  Files will be created in the cache with the
              label of directory specified to the 'dir' command.

       <b>brun</b> <b>&lt;N&gt;%</b>

       <b>bcull</b> <b>&lt;N&gt;%</b>

       <b>bstop</b> <b>&lt;N&gt;%</b>

       <b>frun</b> <b>&lt;N&gt;%</b>

       <b>fcull</b> <b>&lt;N&gt;%</b>

       <b>fstop</b> <b>&lt;N&gt;%</b>
              These commands configure the culling limits.  The defaults are 7% (run), 5% (cull) and  1%  (stop)
              respectively.  See the section on cache culling for more information.

              The  commands  beginning with a 'b' are file space (block) limits, those beginning with an 'f' are
              file count limits.

       <b>tag</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              This command specifies a tag to FS-Cache to use in distinguishing multiple caches.  This  is  only
              required if more than one cache is going to be used.  The default is "CacheFiles".

       <b>culltable</b> <b>&lt;log2size&gt;</b>
              This  command specifies the size of the tables holding the lists of cullable objects in the cache.
              The bigger the number, the faster and more smoothly that culling can proceed when there  are  many
              objects in the cache, but the more memory will be consumed by cachefilesd.

              The  quantity is specified as log2 of the size actually required, for example 12 indicates a table
              of 4096 entries and 13 indicates 8192 entries.  The permissible values are between 12 and 20,  the
              latter indicating 1048576 entries.  The default is 12.

       <b>nocull</b> Disable  culling.   Culling  and  building up the cull table take up a certain amount of a systems
              resources, which may be undesirable.  Supplying this option disables all  culling  activity.   The
              cache  will  keep building up to the limits set and won't be shrunk, except by the removal of out-
              dated cache files.

       <b>resume_thresholds</b> <b>&lt;blocks&gt;</b> <b>&lt;files&gt;</b>
              This command specifies the amount of blocks or files that the kernel should let go of  before  the
              daemon should resume from culling table scan suspension.

              Scanning  to  refill  the  cull table is suspended when all the objects in a cache are pinned by a
              live network filesystem in the kernel and there's nothing to cull.

              Either value can be "-" to indicate that this threshold should be ignored.

       <b>debug</b> <b>&lt;mask&gt;</b>
              This command specifies a numeric bitmask to control debugging in the kernel module.   The  default
              is zero (all off).  The following values can be OR'd into the mask to collect various information:

              <b>1</b>      Turn on trace of function entry (_enter() macros)

              <b>2</b>      Turn on trace of function exit (_leave() macros)

              <b>4</b>      Turn on trace of internal debug points (_debug())

              This mask can also be set through /sys/module/cachefiles/parameters/debug.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       As an example, consider the following:

              dir /var/cache/fscache
              secctx cachefiles_kernel_t
              tag mycache
              brun 10%
              bcull 7%
              bstop 3%
              secctx system_u:system_r:cachefiles_kernel_t:s0

       This  places  the  cache  storage  objects  in  a  directory called "/var/cache/fscache", names the cache
       "mycache",  permits  the  cache  to  run  freely  as  long  as  there's  at  least  10%  free  space   on
       /var/cache/fscache/,  starts  culling  the cache when the free space drops below 7% and stops writing new
       stuff into the cache if the amount of free space drops below 3%.  If the cache  is  suspended,  it  won't
       reactivate until the amount of free space rises again to 10% or better.

       Furthermore, this will tell the kernel module the security context it should use when accessing the cache
       (SELinux  is assumed to be the LSM in this example).  In this case, SELinux would use cachefiles_kernel_t
       as the key into the policy.

</pre><h4><b>CACHE</b> <b>CULLING</b></h4><pre>
       The cache may need culling occasionally to make space.  This involves discarding objects from  the  cache
       that  have  been  used  less  recently  than  anything else.  Culling is based on the access time of data
       objects.  Empty directories are culled if not in use.

       Cache culling is done on the basis of the percentage of blocks and the percentage of files  available  in
       the underlying filesystem.  There are six "limits":

       <b>brun</b>

       <b>frun</b>   If  the amount of free space and the number of available files in the cache rises above both these
              limits, then culling is turned off.

       <b>bcull</b>

       <b>fcull</b>  If the amount of available space or the number of available files in the cache falls below  either
              of these limits, then culling is started.

       <b>bstop</b>

       <b>fstop</b>  If  the amount of available space or the number of available files in the cache falls below either
              of these limits, then no further allocation of disk space or files is permitted until culling  has
              raised things above these limits again.

       These must be configured thusly:

              0 &lt;= bstop &lt; bcull &lt; brun &lt; 100
              0 &lt;= fstop &lt; fcull &lt; frun &lt; 100

       Note  that  these  are percentages of available space and available files, and do <u>not</u> appear as 100 minus
       the percentage displayed by the <b>df</b> program.

       The userspace daemon scans the cache to build up a table of cullable objects.  These are then  culled  in
       least  recently  used  order.   A new scan of the cache is started as soon as space is made in the table.
       Objects will be skipped if their atimes have changed or if the kernel module says it is still using them.

       Culling can be disabled with the <b>nocull</b> option.
