       ipmi-config - IPMI configuration file details

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Before many IPMI tools can be used over a network, a machine's Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) must
       be  configured.  The  configuration can be quite daunting for those who do not know much about IPMI. This
       manpage hopes to provide enough information on BMC configuration so that you can configure  the  BMC  for
       your system. When appropriate, typical BMC configurations will be suggested.

       The  following is an example configuration file partially generated by running the <u>--checkout</u> option with
       the <b><a href="../man8/ipmi-config.8.html">ipmi-config</a>(8)</b> command. This configuration comes from the <u>core</u> category of configuration values  (the
       default).  This  example configuration should be sufficient for most users after the appropriate local IP
       and MAC addresses are input. Following this example, separate sections of this manpage will  discuss  the
       different  sections  of  the  configuration  file  in more detail with explanations of how the BMC can be
       configured for different environments.

       Note that many options may or may not be available on your particular machine. For example,  Serial-Over-
       Lan  (SOL) is available only on IPMI 2.0 machines. Therefore, if you are looking to configure an IPMI 1.5
       machine, many of the SOL or IPMI 2.0 related options will  be  be  unavailable  to  you.  The  number  of
       configurable users may also vary for your particular machine.

       The  below configuration file and most of this manpage assume the user is interested in configuring a BMC
       for use with IPMI over LAN.  Various configuration options from <b><a href="../man8/ipmi-config.8.html">ipmi-config</a>(8)</b>  have  been  left  out  or
       skipped  because  it is considered unnecessary.  Future versions of this manpage will try to include more
       information.

</pre><h4><b>Section</b> <b>User1,</b> <b>User2,</b> <b>...</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>User</u> sections of the BMC configuration  file  are  for  username  configuration  for  IPMI  over  LAN
       communication.  The  number of users available to be configured on your system will vary by manufacturer.
       With the exception of the Username for User1, all sections are identical.

       The username(s) you wish to configure the BMC with are defined with <u>Username</u>. The  first  username  under
       Section User1 is typically the NULL username and cannot be modified. The password for the username can be
       specified  with  <u>Password</u>.  It  can be left empty to define a NULL password. Each user you wish to enable
       must be enabled through the <u>Enable_User</u> configuration option. It is recommended that all  usernames  have
       non-NULL passwords or be disabled for security reasons.

       <u>Lan_Enable_Ipmi_Msgs</u>  is  used to enable or disable IPMI over LAN access for the user. This should be set
       to "Yes" to allow IPMI over LAN tools to work.

       <u>Lan_Privilege_Limit</u> specifies the maximum privilege level limit  the  user  is  allowed.  Different  IPMI
       commands  have  different  privilege restrictions. For example, determining the power status of a machine
       only requires the "User" privilege level. However,  power  cycling  requires  the  "Operator"  privilege.
       Typically, you will want to assign atleast one user with a privilege limit of "Administrator" so that all
       system functions are available to atleast one user via IPMI over LAN.

       <u>Lan_Session_Limit</u>  specifies  the  number  of simultaneous IPMI sessions allowed for the user. Most users
       will wish to set this to "0" to allow unlimited simultaneous IPMI  sessions.  This  field  is  considered
       optional by IPMI standards, and may result in errors when attempting to configure it to a non-zero value.
       If errors to occur, setting the value back to 0 should resolve problems.

       <u>SOL_Payload_Access</u>  specifies if a particular user is allowed to connect with Serial-Over-LAN (SOL). This
       should be set to "Yes" to allow this username to use SOL.

       The example configuration above disables "User2" but enables the default "NULL"  (i.e.  anonymous)  user.
       Many  IPMI  tools  (both open-source and vendor) do not allow the user to input a username and assume the
       NULL username by default. If the tools you are interested in using allow usernames to be input,  then  it
       is  recommended that one of the non-NULL usernames be enabled and the NULL username disabled for security
       reasons. It is recommended that you disable the NULL  username  in  section  User1,  so  that  users  are
       required to specify a username for IPMI over LAN communication.

       Some  motherboards  may  require a <u>Username</u> to be configured prior to other fields being read/written. If
       this is the case, those fields will be set to <u>&lt;username-not-set-yet&gt;</u>.

</pre><h4><b>Section</b> <b>Lan_Channel</b></h4><pre>
       The Lan_Channel section configures a variety of IPMI over LAN configuration parameters. Both <u>Volatile</u> and
       <u>Non_Volatile</u> configurations can be set. <u>Volatile</u> configurations are immediately configured onto  the  BMC
       and  will  have  immediate effect on the system. <u>Non_Volatile</u> configurations are only available after the
       next system reset. Generally, both the <u>Volatile</u> and <u>Non_Volatile</u> should be configured identically.

       The <u>Access_Mode</u> parameter configures the availability of IPMI over LAN  on  the  system.  Typically  this
       should be set to "Always_Available" to enable IPMI over LAN.

       The  <u>Privilege_Limit</u> sets the maximum privilege any user of the system can have when performing IPMI over
       LAN. This should be set to the maximum privilege level configured to a username. Typically,  this  should
       be set to "Administrator".

       Typically  <u>User_Level_Auth</u> and <u>Per_Message_Auth</u> should be set to "Yes" for additional security. Disabling
       <u>User_Level_Auth</u> allows "User" privileged IPMI commands to be executed without  authentication.  Disabling
       <u>Per_Message_Auth</u> allows fewer individual IPMI messages to require authentication.

</pre><h4><b>Section</b> <b>Lan_Conf</b></h4><pre>
       Those  familiar with setting up networks should find most of the fields in this section self explanatory.
       The  example  BMC  configuration  above  illustrates  the  setup  of  a  static  IP  address.  The  field
       <u>IP_Address_Source</u>  is  configured with "Static". The IP address, subnet mask, and gateway IP addresses of
       the machine are respectively configured with the <u>IP_Address</u>, <u>Subnet_Mask</u>, <u>Default_Gateway_Ip_Address</u>, and
       <u>Backup_Gateway_Ip_Address</u> fields. The respective MAC addresses for the IP addresses are configured  under
       <u>Mac_Address</u>, <u>Default_Gateway_Mac_Address</u>, and <u>Backup_Gateway_Mac_Address</u>.

       It is not required to setup the BMC <u>IP_Address</u> to be the same <u>P_Address</u> used by your operating system for
       that network interface. However, if you choose to use a different address, an alternate ARP configuration
       may need to be setup.

       To  instead setup your BMC network information via DHCP, the field <u>IP_Address_Source</u> should be configured
       with "Use_DHCP".

       It  is  recommended  that  static  IP  addresses  be  configured  for  address  resolution  reasons.  See
       <b>Lan_Conf_Misc</b> below for a more detailed explanation.

</pre><h4><b>Section</b> <b>Lan_Conf_Auth</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  determines  what  types  of  password  authentication  mechanisms are allowed for users at
       different privilege levels under the IPMI 1.5 protocol. The currently  supported  authentication  methods
       for  IPMI  1.5  are  <u>None</u>  (no  username/password required), <u>Straight_Password</u> (passwords are sent in the
       clear), <u>MD2</u> (passwords are MD2 hashed), and <u>MD5</u> (passwords  are  MD5  hashed).   Different  usernames  at
       different  privilege  levels  may  be allowed to authenticate differently through this configuration. For
       example, a username with "User" privileges may be allowed to authenticate with a straight password, but a
       username with "Administrator" privileges may be allowed only authenticate with MD5.

       The above example configuration supports <u>MD2</u>  and  <u>MD5</u>  authentication  for  all  users  at  the  "User",
       "Operator",  and  "Administrator"  privilege levels. All authentication mechanisms have been disabled for
       the "Callback" privilege level.

       Generally speaking, you do not want to allow any user to authenticate with <u>None</u> or <u>Straight_Password</u>  for
       security  reasons.  <u>MD2</u> and <u>MD5</u> are digital signature algorithms that can minimally encrypt passwords. If
       you have chosen to support the NULL username (enabled  User1)  and  NULL  passwords  (NULL  password  for
       User1), you will have to enable the <u>None</u> authentication fields above to allow users to connect via <u>None</u>.

</pre><h4><b>Section</b> <b>Lan_Conf_Security_Keys</b></h4><pre>
       This  section supports configuration of the IPMI 2.0 (including Serial-over-LAN) K_g key. If your machine
       does not support IPMI 2.0, this field will not be configurable.

       The key is used for two-key authentication in IPMI 2.0. In most tools, when doing IPMI 2.0, the  K_g  can
       be optionally specified. It is not required for IPMI 2.0 operation.

       In the above example, we have elected to leave this field blank so the K_g key is not used.

</pre><h4><b>Section</b> <b>Lan_Conf_Misc</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  lists  miscellaneous  IPMI  over  LAN  configuration  options.   These  are  optional IPMI
       configuration options that are not implemented on all BMCs.

       Normally, a client cannot resolve the ethernet MAC address without the remote operating  system  running.
       However,  IPMI  over  LAN  would  not work when a machine is powered off or if the IP address used by the
       operating system for that network interface differs from the BMC IP Address. One way to work around  this
       is  through  gratuitous  ARPs.   Gratuitous  ARPs  are  ARP  packets generated by the BMC and sent out to
       advertise the BMC's IP and MAC address.  Other machines on the network  can  store  this  information  in
       their  local  ARP cache for later IP/hostname resolution. This would allow IPMI over LAN to work when the
       remote machine is powered off. The <u>Enable_Gratuitous_Arps</u> option allows you to  enable  or  disable  this
       feature.  The  <u>Gratuitous_Arp_Interval</u>  option  allows you to configure the frequency at which gratuitous
       ARPs are sent onto the network.

       Instead of gratuitous ARPs some BMCs are able to respond to ARP  requests,  even  when  powered  off.  If
       offerred, this feature can be enabled through the <u>Enable_Arp_Response</u> option.

       Generally  speaking, turning on gratuitous ARPs is acceptable.  However, it will increase traffic on your
       network.  If you are using IPMI on a large cluster, the gratuitous ARPs may easily  flood  your  network.
       They  should be tuned to occur less frequently or disabled. If disabled, the remote machine's MAC address
       should be permanently stored in the local ARP cache through <b><a href="../man8/arp.8.html">arp</a>(8).</b>

       See <b><a href="../man8/bmc-watchdog.8.html">bmc-watchdog</a>(8)</b> for a method which allows gratuitous ARPs to be disabled when the operating system is
       running, but enabled when the system is down.

</pre><h4><b>Section</b> <b>Rmcpplus_Conf_Privilege</b></h4><pre>
       This section supports configuration of the IPMI 2.0 (including Serial-over-LAN) cipher suite IDs. If your
       machine does not support IPMI 2.0, the fields will not be configurable.

       Each cipher suite ID describes a combination of an authentication  algorithm,  integrity  algorithm,  and
       encryption algorithm for IPMI 2.0.  The authentication algorithm is used for user authentication with the
       BMC.  The  integrity  algorithm  is  used  for generating signatures on IPMI packets. The confidentiality
       algorithm is used for encrypting data. The configuration in this section enables certain cipher suite IDs
       to be enabled or disabled, and the maximum privilege level a username can authenticate with.

       The following table shows the cipher suite ID to algorithms mapping:

       0 - Authentication Algorithm = None; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None

       1 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None

       2 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality Algorithm =
       None

       3 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality Algorithm =
       AES-CBC-128

       4 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality Algorithm =
       xRC4-128

       5 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality Algorithm =
       xRC4-40

       6 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None

       7 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm  =
       None

       8  - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
       AES-CBC-128

       9 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm  =
       xRC4-128

       10 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
       xRC4-40

       11 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm = None

       12 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm = AES-
       CBC-128

       13  -  Authentication  Algorithm  =  HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
       xRC4-128

       14 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm  =  MD5-128;  Confidentiality  Algorithm  =
       xRC4-40

       Generally  speaking, HMAC-SHA1 based algorithms are stronger than HMAC-MD5, which are better than MD5-128
       algorithms. AES-CBC-128 confidentiality algorithms are  stronger  than  xRC4-128  algorithms,  which  are
       better than xRC4-40 algorithms. Cipher suite ID 3 is therefore typically considered the most secure. Some
       users may wish to set cipher suite ID 3 to a privilege level and disable all remaining cipher suite IDs.

       The  above  example  configuration  has decided to allow any user with "Administrator" privileges use any
       Cipher Suite algorithm suite which requires an authentication, integrity, and confidentiality  algorithm.
       Typically,  the  maximum  privilege  level  configured to a username should be set for atleast one cipher
       suite ID. Typically, this is the "Administrator" privilege.

       A number of cipher suite IDs are optionally implemented, so the available cipher suite IDs available your
       system may vary.

</pre><h4><b>Section</b> <b>SOL_Conf</b></h4><pre>
       This section is for setting up Serial-Over-Lan (SOL) and will only  be  available  for  configuration  on
       those  machines.  SOL  can be enabled with the <u>Enable_SOL</u> field. The minimum privilege level required for
       connecting with SOL is specified by <u>SOL_Privilege_Level</u>.  This should be set  to  the  maximum  privilege
       level  configured  to  a username that has SOL enabled. Typically, this is the "Administrator" privilege.
       Authentication and Encryption can be forced or not using the fields <u>Force_SOL_Payload_Authentication</u>  and
       <u>Force_SOL_Payload_Encryption</u>  respectively.  It  is  recommended  that  these  be set on. However, forced
       authentication and/or encryption support depend on the cipher suite IDs supported.

       The <u>Character_Accumulate_Interval</u>, <u>Character_Send_Threshold</u> , <u>SOL_Retry_Count</u>  and  ,  <u>SOL_Retry_Interval</u>
       options  are  used to set SOL character output speeds. <u>Character_Accumulate_Interval</u> determines how often
       serial data should be regularly sent and <u>Character_Send_Threshold</u> indicates the character count  that  if
       passed,  will  force  serial  data  to  be sent. <u>SOL_Retry_Count</u> indicates how many times packets must be
       retransmitted if acknowledgements are not received. <u>SOL_Retry_Interval</u> indicates  the  timeout  interval.
       Generally,  the  manufacturer recommended numbers will be sufficient. However, you may wish to experiment
       with these values for faster SOL throughput.

       The <u>Non_Volatile_Bit_Rate</u> and <u>Volatile_Bit_Rate</u> determine the baudrate the BMC should  use.  This  should
       match the baudrate set in the BIOS and operating system, such as <b><a href="../man8/agetty.8.html">agetty</a>(8).</b>  Generally speaking, both the
       <u>Volatile</u> and <u>Non_Volatile</u> options should be set identically.

       In  addition  to  enabling  SOL in this section, individual users most also be capable of connecting with
       SOL. See the section <b>Section</b> <b>User1,</b> <b>User2,</b> <b>...</b>  above for details.
