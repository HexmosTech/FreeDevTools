       sudoers.ldap — sudo LDAP configuration

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the standard <u>sudoers</u> file, <b>sudo</b> may be configured via LDAP.  This can be especially useful
       for synchronizing <u>sudoers</u> in a large, distributed environment.

       Using LDAP for <u>sudoers</u> has several benefits:

       <b>•</b>  <b>sudo</b>  no longer needs to read <u>sudoers</u> in its entirety.  When LDAP is used, there are only two or three
          LDAP queries per  invocation.   This  makes  it  especially  fast  and  particularly  usable  in  LDAP
          environments.

       <b>•</b>  It  is  possible  to specify per-entry options that override the global default options.  <u><a href="file:/etc/sudoers">/etc/sudoers</a></u>
          only supports default options and limited options  associated  with  user/host/commands/aliases.   The
          syntax  is  complicated and can be difficult for users to understand.  Placing the options directly in
          the entry is more natural.

       <b>•</b>  The <b>visudo</b> program is  no  longer  needed.   <b>visudo</b>  provides  locking  and  syntax  checking  of  the
          <u><a href="file:/etc/sudoers">/etc/sudoers</a></u>  file.  Since LDAP updates are atomic, locking is no longer necessary.  Because syntax is
          checked when the data is inserted into LDAP, there is no need for a specialized tool to check syntax.

   <b>SUDOers</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>container</b>
       The <u>sudoers</u> configuration is contained in the ‘ou=SUDOers’ LDAP container.

       Sudo first looks for the ‘cn=defaults’ entry in  the  SUDOers  container.   If  found,  the  multi-valued
       <u>sudoOption</u>  attribute  is  parsed  in  the same manner as a global <u>Defaults</u> line in <u><a href="file:/etc/sudoers">/etc/sudoers</a></u>.  In the
       following example, the SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable will be preserved in the environment for all users.

           dn: cn=defaults,ou=SUDOers,dc=my-domain,dc=com
           objectClass: top
           objectClass: sudoRole
           cn: defaults
           description: Default sudoOption's go here
           sudoOption: env_keep+=SSH_AUTH_SOCK

       The equivalent of a sudoer in LDAP is a <u>sudoRole</u>.  It consists of the following attributes:

       <b>sudoUser</b>
             A user name, user-ID (prefixed with ‘#’), Unix  group  name  or  ID  (prefixed  with  ‘%’  or  ‘%#’
             respectively),  user netgroup (prefixed with ‘+’), or non-Unix group name or ID (prefixed with ‘%:’
             or ‘%:#’ respectively).  User netgroups are matched using the user and  domain  members  only;  the
             host  member  is  not  used  when  matching.   Non-Unix  group  support  is  only available when an
             appropriate <u>group_plugin</u> is defined in the global <u>defaults</u> <u>sudoRole</u> object.  If a <u>sudoUser</u> entry is
             preceded by an exclamation point, ‘!’, and the entry matches, the <u>sudoRole</u> in which it resides will
             be ignored.  Negated <u>sudoUser</u> entries are only supported by version 1.9.9 or higher.

       <b>sudoHost</b>
             A host name, IP address, IP network, or host netgroup (prefixed with a ‘+’).  The special value <b>ALL</b>
             will match any host.  Host netgroups are matched using the host (both  qualified  and  unqualified)
             and  domain  members  only;  the  user  member  is  not used when matching.  If a <u>sudoHost</u> entry is
             preceded by an exclamation point, ‘!’, and the entry matches, the <u>sudoRole</u> in which it resides will
             be ignored.  Negated <u>sudoHost</u> entries are only supported by version 1.8.18 or higher.

       <b>sudoCommand</b>
             A fully-qualified Unix command name with optional command  line  arguments,  potentially  including
             globbing  characters (aka wild cards).  If a command name is preceded by an exclamation point, ‘!’,
             the user will be prohibited from running that command.

             The built-in command “sudoedit” is used to permit a user to run <b>sudo</b> with  the  <b>-e</b>  option  (or  as
             <b>sudoedit</b>).   It  may  take  command  line  arguments  just  as a normal command does.  Unlike other
             commands, “sudoedit” is a built into <b>sudo</b> itself and must be specified in without a leading path.

             The special value <b>ALL</b> will match any command.

             If a command name is prefixed with a SHA-2 digest, it will only be allowed if the  digest  matches.
             This  may  be  useful in situations where the user invoking <b>sudo</b> has write access to the command or
             its parent directory.  The following digest formats are  supported:  sha224,  sha256,  sha384,  and
             sha512.   The  digest  name must be followed by a colon (‘:’) and then the actual digest, in either
             hex or base64 format.  For example, given the following value for sudoCommand:

                 sha224:0GomF8mNN3wlDt1HD9XldjJ3SNgpFdbjO1+NsQ <a href="file:/bin/ls">/bin/ls</a>

             The user may only run <u><a href="file:/bin/ls">/bin/ls</a></u> if its sha224 digest matches the specified  value.   Command  digests
             are only supported by version 1.8.7 or higher.

       <b>sudoOption</b>
             Identical  in function to the global options described above, but specific to the <u>sudoRole</u> in which
             it resides.

       <b>sudoRunAsUser</b>
             A user name or user-ID (prefixed with ‘#’) that commands may be run as or a  Unix  group  (prefixed
             with  a ‘%’) or user netgroup (prefixed with a ‘+’) that contains a list of users that commands may
             be run as.  The special value <b>ALL</b> will match any user.  If a <u>sudoRunAsUser</u> entry is preceded by  an
             exclamation  point,  ‘!’,  and the entry matches, the <u>sudoRole</u> in which it resides will be ignored.
             If <u>sudoRunAsUser</u> is specified but empty, it will match the invoking user.  If neither <u>sudoRunAsUser</u>
             nor <u>sudoRunAsGroup</u> are present, the value of the <u>runas_default</u>  <u>sudoOption</u>  is  used  (defaults  to
             root).

             The <u>sudoRunAsUser</u> attribute is only available in <b>sudo</b> versions 1.7.0 and higher.  Older versions of
             <b>sudo</b>  use  the  <u>sudoRunAs</u>  attribute  instead.  Negated <u>sudoRunAsUser</u> entries are only supported by
             version 1.8.26 or higher.

       <b>sudoRunAsGroup</b>
             A Unix group or group-ID (prefixed with ‘#’) that commands may be run as.  The  special  value  <b>ALL</b>
             will  match any group.  If a <u>sudoRunAsGroup</u> entry is preceded by an exclamation point, ‘!’, and the
             entry matches, the <u>sudoRole</u> in which it resides will be ignored.

             The <u>sudoRunAsGroup</u> attribute is  only  available  in  <b>sudo</b>  versions  1.7.0  and  higher.   Negated
             <u>sudoRunAsGroup</u> entries are only supported by version 1.8.26 or higher.

       <b>sudoNotBefore</b>
             A  timestamp  in  the form ‘yyyymmddHHMMSSZ’ that can be used to provide a start date/time for when
             the <u>sudoRole</u> will be valid.  If multiple <u>sudoNotBefore</u> entries are present, the earliest  is  used.
             Timestamps  must  be  in  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), not the local timezone.  The minute and
             seconds portions are optional, but some LDAP servers require that they be present (contrary to  the
             RFC).

             The  <u>sudoNotBefore</u>  attribute  is  only  available  in  <b>sudo</b>  versions 1.7.5 and higher and must be
             explicitly enabled via the <b>SUDOERS_TIMED</b> option in <u>/etc/sudo-ldap.conf</u>.

       <b>sudoNotAfter</b>
             A timestamp in the form ‘yyyymmddHHMMSSZ’ that indicates an expiration date/time, after  which  the
             <u>sudoRole</u>  will  no  longer be valid.  If multiple <u>sudoNotAfter</u> entries are present, the last one is
             used.  Timestamps must be in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), not the local timezone.  The  minute
             and  seconds portions are optional, but some LDAP servers require that they be present (contrary to
             the RFC).

             The <u>sudoNotAfter</u> attribute is only available  in  <b>sudo</b>  versions  1.7.5  and  higher  and  must  be
             explicitly enabled via the <b>SUDOERS_TIMED</b> option in <u>/etc/sudo-ldap.conf</u>.

       <b>sudoOrder</b>
             The  <u>sudoRole</u>  entries  retrieved  from  the  LDAP directory have no inherent order.  The <u>sudoOrder</u>
             attribute is an integer (or floating point value for LDAP servers that support it) that is used  to
             sort  the  matching  entries.   This  allows  LDAP-based  sudoers entries to more closely mimic the
             behavior of the sudoers file, where the order of the entries influences the  result.   If  multiple
             entries  match,  the entry with the highest <u>sudoOrder</u> attribute is chosen.  This corresponds to the
             “last match” behavior of the sudoers file.  If the <u>sudoOrder</u> attribute is not present, a value of 0
             is assumed.

             The <u>sudoOrder</u> attribute is only available in <b>sudo</b> versions 1.7.5 and higher.

       Each attribute listed above should contain a single value, but there may be multiple  instances  of  each
       attribute type.  A <u>sudoRole</u> must contain at least one <u>sudoUser</u>, <u>sudoHost</u>, and <u>sudoCommand</u>.

       The following example allows users in group wheel to run any command on any host via <b>sudo</b>:

           dn: cn=%wheel,ou=SUDOers,dc=my-domain,dc=com
           objectClass: top
           objectClass: sudoRole
           cn: %wheel
           sudoUser: %wheel
           sudoHost: ALL
           sudoCommand: ALL

   <b>Anatomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>sudoers</b> <b>lookup</b>
       When  looking  up a sudoer using LDAP there are only two or three LDAP queries per invocation.  The first
       query is to parse the global options.  The second is to match against the user's name and the groups that
       the user belongs to.  (The special <b>ALL</b> tag is matched in this query too.)  If no match  is  returned  for
       the  user's  name  and groups, a third query returns all entries containing user netgroups and other non-
       Unix groups and checks to see if the user belongs to any of them.

       If timed entries are enabled with the <b>SUDOERS_TIMED</b> parameter, the LDAP queries include a sub-filter that
       limits retrieval to entries that satisfy the time constraints, if any.

       If the <b>NETGROUP_BASE</b> parameter is present and <b>NETGROUP_QUERY</b> has  not  been  disabled  (see  “Configuring
       ldap.conf”  below),  queries  are performed to determine the list of netgroups the user belongs to before
       the sudoers query.  This makes it possible to include netgroups in the sudoers query string in  the  same
       manner  as  Unix groups.  The third query mentioned above is not performed unless a group provider plugin
       is also configured.  The actual LDAP queries performed by <b>sudo</b> are as follows:

       1.   Match all <u>nisNetgroup</u> records with a <u>nisNetgroupTriple</u> containing the user, host,  and  NIS  domain.
            The  query  will match <u>nisNetgroupTriple</u> entries with either the short or long form of the host name
            or no host name specified in the tuple.  If the NIS domain is set, the query will match  only  match
            entries  that  include the domain or for which there is no domain present.  If the NIS domain is <u>not</u>
            set, a wildcard is used to match any domain name but be aware that the NIS schema used by some  LDAP
            servers may not support wild cards for <u>nisNetgroupTriple</u>.

       2.   Repeated queries are performed to find any nested <u>nisNetgroup</u> records with a <u>memberNisNetgroup</u> entry
            that refers to an already-matched record.

       For  sites  with  a  large  number  of  netgroups,  using <b>NETGROUP_BASE</b> can significantly speed up <b>sudo</b>'s
       execution  time  as  long  as  the  LDAP  server  supports  querying  the  <u>nisNetgroup</u>  object   by   its
       <u>nisNetgroupTriple</u> attribute.

   <b>Differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-LDAP</b> <b>sudoers</b>
       One  of  the major differences between LDAP and file-based <u>sudoers</u> is that in LDAP, <b>sudo</b>-specific Aliases
       are not supported.

       For the most part, there is little need for <b>sudo</b>-specific Aliases.  Unix groups, non-Unix groups (via the
       <u>group_plugin</u>), or user netgroups can be used in place of User_Aliases and Runas_Aliases.  Host  netgroups
       can  be used in place of Host_Aliases.  Since groups and netgroups can also be stored in LDAP there is no
       real need for <b>sudo</b>-specific aliases.

       There are also some subtle differences in the way sudoers is handled once in LDAP.  Probably the  biggest
       is  that  according  to  the  RFC,  LDAP  ordering is arbitrary and you cannot expect that Attributes and
       Entries are returned in any specific order.

       The order in which different entries are applied can be controlled using  the  <u>sudoOrder</u>  attribute,  but
       there  is  no way to guarantee the order of attributes within a specific entry.  If there are conflicting
       command rules in an entry, the  negative  takes  precedence.   This  is  called  paranoid  behavior  (not
       necessarily the most specific match).

       Here is an example:

           # <a href="file:/etc/sudoers">/etc/sudoers</a>:
           # Allow all commands except shell
           johnny  ALL=(root) ALL,!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
           # Always allows all commands because ALL is matched last
           puddles ALL=(root) !<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>,ALL

           # LDAP equivalent of johnny
           # Allows all commands except shell
           dn: cn=role1,ou=Sudoers,dc=my-domain,dc=com
           objectClass: sudoRole
           objectClass: top
           cn: role1
           sudoUser: johnny
           sudoHost: ALL
           sudoCommand: ALL
           sudoCommand: !<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>

           # LDAP equivalent of puddles
           # Notice that even though ALL comes last, it still behaves like
           # role1 since the LDAP code assumes the more paranoid configuration
           dn: cn=role2,ou=Sudoers,dc=my-domain,dc=com
           objectClass: sudoRole
           objectClass: top
           cn: role2
           sudoUser: puddles
           sudoHost: ALL
           sudoCommand: !<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
           sudoCommand: ALL

   <b>Converting</b> <b>between</b> <b>file-based</b> <b>and</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>sudoers</b>
       The <u><a href="../man1/cvtsudoers.1.html">cvtsudoers</a></u>(1) utility can be used to convert between file-based and LDAP <u>sudoers</u>.  However, there are
       features in the file-based sudoers that have no equivalent in LDAP-based sudoers (and vice versa).  These
       cannot be converted automatically.

       For  example,  a  Cmnd_Alias  in  a  <u>sudoers</u>  file  may be converted to a <u>sudoRole</u> that contains multiple
       commands.  Multiple users and/or groups may be assigned to the <u>sudoRole</u>.

       Also, host, user, runas, and command-based <u>Defaults</u> entries are not supported.  However, a  <u>sudoRole</u>  may
       contain one or more <u>sudoOption</u> attributes which can often serve the same purpose.

       Consider the following <u>sudoers</u> lines:

           Cmnd_Alias PAGERS = <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?more">/usr/bin/more</a>, /usr/bin/pg, <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?less">/usr/bin/less</a>
           Defaults!PAGERS noexec
           alice, bob ALL = ALL

       In  this  example,  alice and bob are allowed to run all commands, but the commands listed in PAGERS will
       have the noexec flag set, preventing shell escapes.

       When converting this to LDAP, two sudoRole objects can be used:

           dn: cn=PAGERS,ou=SUDOers,dc=my-domain,dc=com
           objectClass: top
           objectClass: sudoRole
           cn: PAGERS
           sudoUser: alice
           sudoUser: bob
           sudoHost: ALL
           sudoCommand: <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?more">/usr/bin/more</a>
           sudoCommand: /usr/bin/pg
           sudoCommand: <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?less">/usr/bin/less</a>
           sudoOption: noexec
           sudoOrder: 900

           dn: cn=ADMINS,ou=SUDOers,dc=my-domain,dc=com
           objectClass: top
           objectClass: sudoRole
           cn: ADMINS
           sudoUser: alice
           sudoUser: bob
           sudoHost: ALL
           sudoCommand: ALL
           sudoOrder: 100

       In the LDAP version, the sudoOrder attribute is used to guarantee that the PAGERS  sudoRole  with  <u>noexec</u>
       has  precedence.   Unlike  the  <u>sudoers</u>  version,  the  LDAP version requires that all users for whom the
       restriction should apply be assigned to the PAGERS sudoRole.  Using a Unix group or  netgroup  in  PAGERS
       rather than listing each user would make this easier to maintain.

       Per-user  <u>Defaults</u>  entries  can  be  emulated  by using one or more sudoOption attributes in a sudoRole.
       Consider the following <u>sudoers</u> lines:

           User_Alias ADMINS = john, sally
           Defaults:ADMINS !authenticate
           ADMINS ALL = (ALL:ALL) ALL

       In this example, john and sally are allowed to run any command as any user or group.

       When converting this to LDAP, we can use a Unix group instead of the User_Alias.

           dn: cn=admins,ou=SUDOers,dc=my-domain,dc=com
           objectClass: top
           objectClass: sudoRole
           cn: admins
           sudoUser: %admin
           sudoHost: ALL
           sudoRunAsUser: ALL
           sudoRunAsGroup: ALL
           sudoCommand: ALL
           sudoOption: !authenticate

       This assumes that users john and sally are members of the “admins” Unix group.

   <b>Sudoers</b> <b>schema</b>
       In order to use <b>sudo</b>'s LDAP support, the <b>sudo</b> schema must be installed on your LDAP server.  In addition,
       be sure to index the <u>sudoUser</u> attribute.

       The <b>sudo</b> distribution includes versions of the <b>sudoers</b> schema for multiple LDAP servers:

       <u>schema.ActiveDirectory</u>
             Microsoft Active Directory

       <u>schema.IBM_LDAP</u>
             IBM Directory Server, also known as IBM Tivoli Directory Server, IBM Security Directory Server, and
             IBM Security Verify Directory

       <u>schema.iPlanet</u>
             Netscape-derived servers such as the iPlanet, Oracle, and 389 Directory Servers

       <u>schema.olcSudo</u>
             OpenLDAP slapd 2.3 and higher when on-line configuration is enabled

       <u>schema.OpenLDAP</u>
             OpenLDAP slapd and OpenBSD ldapd

       The schema in OpenLDAP format is also included in the “EXAMPLES” section.

   <b>Configuring</b> <b>ldap.conf</b>
       Sudo reads the <u>/etc/sudo-ldap.conf</u> file for LDAP-specific configuration.  Typically, this file is  shared
       between  different  LDAP-aware  clients.   As  such,  most  of  the  settings  are not <b>sudo</b>-specific. The
       <u>/etc/sudo-ldap.conf</u> file is parsed by <b>sudo</b>  itself  and  may  support  options  that  differ  from  those
       described in the system's <u><a href="../man5/ldap.conf.5.html">ldap.conf</a></u>(5) manual.  The path to <u>ldap.conf</u> may be overridden via the <u>ldap_conf</u>
       plugin argument in <u><a href="../man5/sudo.conf.5.html">sudo.conf</a></u>(5).

       On  systems  using  the  OpenLDAP  libraries,  default values specified in <u>/etc/openldap/ldap.conf</u> or the
       user's <u>.ldaprc</u> files are not used.

       <b>sudo</b> supports a variety of LDAP library implementations, including OpenLDAP, Netscape-derived (also  used
       by  Solaris  and  HP-UX),  and  IBM  LDAP  (aka  Tivoli).   Some  options  are  specific  to certain LDAP
       implementations or have implementation-specific  behavior.   These  differences  are  noted  below  where
       applicable.

       Only  those  options  explicitly  listed  in  <u>/etc/sudo-ldap.conf</u> as being supported by <b>sudo</b> are honored.
       Configuration options are listed below in upper case but are parsed in a case-independent manner.

       Lines beginning with a pound sign (‘#’) are ignored.  Leading white space is removed from  the  beginning
       of lines.

       <b>BIND_TIMELIMIT</b> <u>seconds</u>
             The  <b>BIND_TIMELIMIT</b>  parameter  specifies  the  amount of time, in seconds, to wait while trying to
             connect to an LDAP server.  If multiple <b>URI</b>s or <b>HOST</b>s are specified, this is the amount of time  to
             wait before trying the next one in the list.

       <b>BINDDN</b> <u>DN</u>
             The  <b>BINDDN</b> parameter specifies the identity, in the form of a Distinguished Name (DN), to use when
             performing LDAP operations.  If not specified, LDAP operations  are  performed  with  an  anonymous
             identity.  By default, most LDAP servers will allow anonymous access.

       <b>BINDPW</b> <u>secret</u>
             The  <b>BINDPW</b>  parameter  specifies  the  password  to  use when performing LDAP operations.  This is
             typically used in conjunction with the <b>BINDDN</b> parameter.  The <u>secret</u> may be a plaintext password or
             a base64-encoded string with a “base64:” prefix.  For example:

                 BINDPW base64:dGVzdA==

             If a plaintext password is used, it should be a simple string without quotes.  Plain text passwords
             may not include the comment character (‘#’) and the escaping of special characters with a backslash
             (‘\’) is not supported.

       <b>DEREF</b> <u>never/searching/finding/always</u>
             How alias dereferencing is to be performed when searching.  See the <u><a href="../man5/ldap.conf.5.html">ldap.conf</a></u>(5) manual for a  full
             description of this option.

       <b>HOST</b> <u>name[:port]</u> <u>...</u>
             If  no  <b>URI</b>  is specified (see below), the <b>HOST</b> parameter specifies a white space-delimited list of
             LDAP servers to connect to.  Each host may include an optional <u>port</u> separated  by  a  colon  (‘:’).
             The  <b>HOST</b>  parameter  is  deprecated in favor of the <b>URI</b> specification and is included for backward
             compatibility only.

       <b>KRB5_CCNAME</b> <u>file</u> <u>name</u>
             The path to the Kerberos 5 credential cache to use when authenticating with the remote server.

             This option is only relevant when using SASL authentication (see below).

       <b>LDAP_VERSION</b> <u>number</u>
             The version of the LDAP protocol to use when connecting  to  the  server.   The  default  value  is
             protocol version 3.

       <b>NETGROUP_BASE</b> <u>base</u>
             The  base  DN  to  use  when  performing  LDAP  netgroup  queries.   Typically  this is of the form
             ‘ou=netgroup,dc=my-domain,dc=com’ for the domain my-domain.com.  Multiple <b>NETGROUP_BASE</b>  lines  may
             be specified, in which case they are queried in the order specified.

             When  this  option  is  enabled,  <b>sudo</b>  will query the LDAP server directly when matching netgroups
             present in a <u>sudoRole</u> instead of relying on the C library's <b>innetgr</b>() function.

             Additionally, if the <b>NETGROUP_QUERY</b> parameter (which is enabled by default) has not been  disabled,
             the  user's netgroups will be queried directly via LDAP for use in the main sudoers query.  This is
             usually faster than fetching every <u>sudoRole</u> object containing a <u>sudoUser</u> that  begins  with  a  ‘+’
             prefix  and  checking  whether  the user is a member of each one.  The NIS schema used by some LDAP
             servers needs a modification to support querying the <u>nisNetgroup</u> object  by  its  <u>nisNetgroupTriple</u>
             attribute.   For  example,  OpenLDAP's <b>slapd</b> requires the following change to the <u>nisNetgroupTriple</u>
             attribute:

                 attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.1.1.1.14 NAME 'nisNetgroupTriple'
                    DESC 'Netgroup triple'
                    EQUALITY caseIgnoreIA5Match
                    SUBSTR caseIgnoreIA5SubstringsMatch
                    SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26 )

             Before  enabling  <b>NETGROUP_BASE</b>,  you  should  verify  that  your  LDAP  server  supports  matching
             <u>nisNetgroupTriple</u>.  For example, using <b>ldapsearch</b>:

                 $ ldapsearch -b $NETGROUP_BASE \
                   '(&amp;(objectClass=nisNetgroup)(nisNetgroupTriple=\28*,USER,\29))'

             where your <u>nisNetgroup</u> data includes an object with the following <u>nisNetgroupTriple</u>:

                   <b>nisNetgroupTriple:</b> <b>(,USER,)</b>

       <b>NETGROUP_QUERY</b> <u>on/true/yes/off/false/no</u>
             The <b>NETGROUP_QUERY</b> parameter indicates whether or not the LDAP server supports querying <u>nisNetgroup</u>
             objects  by  matching  on  <u>nisNetgroupTriple</u> attributes.  By default, <b>sudoers</b> expects to be able to
             perform queries that match on <u>nisNetgroupTriple</u> attributes when <b>NETGROUP_BASE</b> is set, but  not  all
             LDAP servers support this.

             If <b>NETGROUP_QUERY</b> is disabled, <b>sudoers</b> will not attempt to determine the list of netgroups the user
             belongs to, but will still use <b>NETGROUP_BASE</b> directly when matching netgroups.  This can be used to
             support  netgroups  on  systems that lack the <b>innetgr</b>() C library function.  See the description of
             the <b>NETGROUP_BASE</b> parameter for more information.

       <b>NETGROUP_SEARCH_FILTER</b> <u>ldap_filter</u>
             An LDAP filter which is used to restrict the set  of  records  returned  when  performing  an  LDAP
             netgroup     query.      Typically,     this     is    of    the    form    ‘attribute=value’    or
             ‘(&amp;(attribute=value)(attribute2=value2))’.       The      default      search      filter       is:
             ‘objectClass=nisNetgroup’.  If <u>ldap_filter</u> is omitted, no search filter will be used.

             This option is only used when querying netgroups directly via LDAP.

       <b>NETWORK_TIMEOUT</b> <u>seconds</u>
             An alias for <b>BIND_TIMELIMIT</b> provided for OpenLDAP compatibility.

       <b>PORT</b> <u>port_number</u>
             If  no  <b>URI</b>  is  specified, the <b>PORT</b> parameter specifies the default port to connect to on the LDAP
             server if a <b>HOST</b> parameter does not specify the port itself.  If no <b>PORT</b>  parameter  is  used,  the
             default  is  port  389  for  LDAP  and  port  636  for  LDAP over TLS (SSL).  The <b>PORT</b> parameter is
             deprecated in favor of the <b>URI</b> specification and is included for backward compatibility only.

       <b>ROOTBINDDN</b> <u>DN</u>
             The <b>ROOTBINDDN</b> parameter specifies the identity, in the form of a Distinguished Name (DN),  to  use
             when performing privileged LDAP operations, such as <u>sudoers</u> queries.  The password corresponding to
             the  identity  should  be stored in the or the path specified by the <u>ldap_secret</u> plugin argument in
             <u><a href="../man5/sudo.conf.5.html">sudo.conf</a></u>(5), which defaults to <u>/etc/ldap.secret</u>.   If  no  <b>ROOTBINDDN</b>  is  specified,  the  <b>BINDDN</b>
             identity is used (if any).

       <b>ROOTUSE_SASL</b> <u>on/true/yes/off/false/no</u>
             Enable  <b>ROOTUSE_SASL</b>  to  enable  SASL  authentication  when  connecting  to  an LDAP server from a
             privileged process, such as <b>sudo</b>.

       <b>SASL_AUTH_ID</b> <u>identity</u>
             The SASL user name to use when connecting to the  LDAP  server.   By  default,  <b>sudo</b>  will  use  an
             anonymous connection.

             This option is only relevant when using SASL authentication.

       <b>SASL_MECH</b> <u>mechanisms</u>
             A  white  space-delimited list of SASL authentication mechanisms to use.  By default, <b>sudo</b> will use
             GSSAPI authentication.

       <b>SASL_SECPROPS</b> <u>none/properties</u>
             SASL security properties or <u>none</u> for no properties.  See the SASL programmer's manual for details.

             This option is only relevant when using SASL authentication.

       <b>SSL</b> <u>on/true/yes/off/false/no</u>
             If the <b>SSL</b> parameter is set to  <u>on</u>,  <u>true</u>,  or  <u>yes</u>  TLS  (SSL)  encryption  is  always  used  when
             communicating  with the LDAP server.  Typically, this involves connecting to the server on port 636
             (ldaps).

       <b>SSL</b> <u>start_tls</u>
             If the <b>SSL</b> parameter is set to <u>start_tls</u>, the LDAP server connection is initiated normally and  TLS
             encryption  is begun before the bind credentials are sent.  This has the advantage of not requiring
             a dedicated port for encrypted communications.  This parameter is only supported  by  LDAP  servers
             that honor the <u>start_tls</u> extension, such as the OpenLDAP and IBM Tivoli Directory servers.

       <b>SUDOERS_BASE</b> <u>base</u>
             The  base  DN  to  use  when  performing  <b>sudo</b>  LDAP  queries.   Typically  this  is  of  the  form
             ‘ou=SUDOers,dc=my-domain,dc=com’ for the domain my-domain.com.  Multiple <b>SUDOERS_BASE</b> lines may  be
             specified, in which case they are queried in the order specified.

       <b>SUDOERS_DEBUG</b> <u>debug_level</u>
             This  sets the debug level for <b>sudo</b> LDAP queries.  Debugging information is printed to the standard
             error.  A value of 1 results in a moderate amount of debugging information.  A value of 2 shows the
             results of the matches themselves.  This parameter should not be set in a production environment as
             the extra information is likely to confuse users.

             The <b>SUDOERS_DEBUG</b> parameter is deprecated and will be  removed  in  a  future  release.   The  same
             information is now logged via the <b>sudo</b> debugging framework using the “ldap” subsystem at priorities
             <u>diag</u> and <u>info</u> for <u>debug_level</u> values 1 and 2 respectively.  See the <u><a href="../man5/sudo.conf.5.html">sudo.conf</a></u>(5) manual for details
             on how to configure <b>sudo</b> debugging.

       <b>SUDOERS_SEARCH_FILTER</b> <u>ldap_filter</u>
             An  LDAP  filter  which is used to restrict the set of records returned when performing a <b>sudo</b> LDAP
             query.       Typically,      this      is      of      the      form      ‘attribute=value’      or
             ‘(&amp;(attribute=value)(attribute2=value2))’.   The  default search filter is: ‘objectClass=sudoRole’.
             If <u>ldap_filter</u> is omitted, no search filter will be used.

       <b>SUDOERS_TIMED</b> <u>on/true/yes/off/false/no</u>
             Whether or not to evaluate the <u>sudoNotBefore</u>  and  <u>sudoNotAfter</u>  attributes  that  implement  time-
             dependent sudoers entries.

       <b>TIMELIMIT</b> <u>seconds</u>
             The <b>TIMELIMIT</b> parameter specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a response to an LDAP
             query.

       <b>TIMEOUT</b> <u>seconds</u>
             The  <b>TIMEOUT</b>  parameter  specifies  the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a response from the
             various LDAP APIs.

       <b>TLS_CACERT</b> <u>file</u> <u>name</u>
             An alias for <b>TLS_CACERTFILE</b> for OpenLDAP compatibility.

       <b>TLS_CACERTFILE</b> <u>file</u> <u>name</u>
             The path to a certificate authority bundle which contains the certificates for all the  Certificate
             Authorities the client knows to be valid, e.g., <u>/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem</u>.

             This  option  is only supported by the OpenLDAP libraries.  Netscape-derived LDAP libraries use the
             same certificate database for CA and client certificates (see <b>TLS_CERT</b>).

       <b>TLS_CACERTDIR</b> <u>directory</u>
             Similar to <b>TLS_CACERTFILE</b>  but  instead  of  a  file,  it  is  a  directory  containing  individual
             Certificate Authority certificates, e.g., <u><a href="file:/etc/ssl/certs">/etc/ssl/certs</a></u>.  The directory specified by <b>TLS_CACERTDIR</b>
             is checked after <b>TLS_CACERTFILE</b>.

             This option is only supported by the OpenLDAP libraries.

       <b>TLS_CERT</b> <u>file</u> <u>name</u>
             The  path  to a file containing the client certificate which can be used to authenticate the client
             to the LDAP server.  The certificate type depends on the LDAP libraries used.

             OpenLDAP:
                   ‘tls_cert /etc/ssl/client_cert.pem’

             Netscape-derived:
                   ‘tls_cert /var/ldap/cert7.db’

             IBM LDAP:
                   Unused, the key database specified by <b>TLS_KEY</b> contains both keys and certificates.

             When  using  Netscape-derived  libraries,  this  file  may  also  contain   Certificate   Authority
             certificates.

       <b>TLS_CHECKPEER</b> <u>on/true/yes/off/false/no</u>
             If  enabled,  <b>TLS_CHECKPEER</b>  will  cause the LDAP server's TLS certificated to be verified.  If the
             server's TLS certificate cannot be verified (usually because it is signed by an unknown certificate
             authority), <b>sudo</b> will be unable to connect to it.  If <b>TLS_CHECKPEER</b> is disabled, no check is  made.
             Disabling  this  check  creates  an  opportunity  for  man-in-the-middle attacks since the server's
             identity will not be authenticated.  If possible, the CA's certificate should be installed  locally
             so it can be verified.

             This option is not supported by the IBM LDAP libraries.

       <b>TLS_KEY</b> <u>file</u> <u>name</u>
             The  path to a file containing the private key which matches the certificate specified by <b>TLS_CERT</b>.
             The private key must not be password-protected.  The key type depends on the LDAP libraries used.

             OpenLDAP:
                   ‘tls_key /etc/ssl/client_key.pem’

             Netscape-derived:
                   ‘tls_key /var/ldap/key3.db’

             IBM LDAP:
                   ‘tls_key /usr/ldap/ldapkey.kdb’

             When using IBM LDAP libraries,  this  file  may  also  contain  Certificate  Authority  and  client
             certificates and may be encrypted.

       <b>TLS_CIPHERS</b> <u>cipher</u> <u>list</u>
             The <b>TLS_CIPHERS</b> parameter allows the administer to restrict which encryption algorithms may be used
             for  TLS  (SSL)  connections.  See the OpenLDAP or IBM Tivoli Directory Server manual for a list of
             valid ciphers.

             This option is not supported by Netscape-derived libraries.

       <b>TLS_KEYPW</b> <u>secret</u>
             The <b>TLS_KEYPW</b> contains the password used to decrypt the key database on clients using the IBM  LDAP
             library.   The  <u>secret</u>  may  be  a  plaintext  password or a base64-encoded string with a “base64:”
             prefix.  For example:

                 TLS_KEYPW base64:dGVzdA==

             If a plaintext password is used, it should be a simple string without quotes.  Plain text passwords
             may not include the comment character (‘#’) and the escaping of special characters with a backslash
             (‘\’) is not supported.  If this option is used, <u>/etc/sudo-ldap.conf</u> must not be world-readable  to
             avoid  exposing  the  password.   Alternately,  a  <u>stash</u>  <u>file</u> can be used to store the password in
             encrypted form (see below).

             If no <b>TLS_KEYPW</b> is specified, a <u>stash</u> <u>file</u> will be used if it exists.  The <u>stash</u> <u>file</u> must have the
             same path as the file specified by <b>TLS_KEY</b>, but use a ‘.sth’ file extension instead of ‘.kdb’,  for
             example  ‘ldapkey.sth’.   The default ‘ldapkey.kdb’ that ships with the IBM Tivoli Directory Server
             is encrypted with the password ‘ssl_password’.  The <u>gsk8capicmd</u> utility can be used to  manage  the
             key database and create a <u>stash</u> <u>file</u>.

             This option is only supported by the IBM LDAP libraries.

       <b>TLS_REQCERT</b> <u>level</u>
             The  <b>TLS_REQCERT</b>  parameter controls how the LDAP server's TLS certificated will be verified (if at
             all).  If the server's TLS certificate cannot be verified (usually  because  it  is  signed  by  an
             unknown  certificate  authority), <b>sudo</b> will be unable to connect to it.  The following <u>level</u> values
             are supported:

                 never
                       The server certificate will not be requested or checked.

                 allow
                       The server certificate will be requested.  A missing or invalid  certificate  is  ignored
                       and not considered an error.

                 try   The  server  certificate  will  be  requested.   A  missing certificate is ignored but an
                       invalid certificate will result in a connection error.

                 demand | <u>hard</u>
                       The server certificate will be requested.  A missing or invalid certificate  will  result
                       in a connection error.  This is the default behavior.

             This  option  is  only  supported by the OpenLDAP libraries.  Other LDAP libraries only support the
             <b>TLS_CHECKPEER</b> parameter.

       <b>TLS_RANDFILE</b> <u>file</u> <u>name</u>
             The <b>TLS_RANDFILE</b> parameter specifies the path to an entropy source for systems that lack  a  random
             device.  It is generally used in conjunction with <u>prngd</u> or <u>egd</u>.

             This option is only supported by the OpenLDAP libraries.

       <b>URI</b> <u>ldap[s]://[hostname[:port]]</u> <u>...</u>
             Specifies a white space-delimited list of one or more URIs describing the LDAP server(s) to connect
             to.   The  <u>protocol</u>  may  be either <u>ldap</u> <u>ldaps</u>, the latter being for servers that support TLS (SSL)
             encryption.  If no <u>port</u> is specified, the default is  port  389  for  ‘ldap://’  or  port  636  for
             ‘ldaps://’.   If  no <u>hostname</u> is specified, <b>sudo</b> will connect to <u>localhost</u>.  Multiple <b>URI</b> lines are
             treated identically to a <b>URI</b> line containing multiple entries.   Only  systems  using  the  OpenSSL
             libraries  support  the mixing of ‘ldap://’ and ‘ldaps://’ URIs.  Both the Netscape-derived and IBM
             LDAP libraries used on most commercial versions of Unix are only capable of supporting one  or  the
             other.

       <b>USE_SASL</b> <u>on/true/yes/off/false/no</u>
             Enable <b>USE_SASL</b> for LDAP servers that support SASL authentication.

       <b>ROOTSASL_AUTH_ID</b> <u>identity</u>
             The SASL user name to use when <b>ROOTUSE_SASL</b> is enabled.

       See the <u>ldap.conf</u> entry in the “EXAMPLES” section.

   <b>Configuring</b> <b>nsswitch.conf</b>
       Unless  it  is disabled at build time, <b>sudo</b> consults the Name Service Switch file, <u><a href="file:/etc/nsswitch.conf">/etc/nsswitch.conf</a></u>, to
       specify the <u>sudoers</u> search order.  Sudo looks for a  line  beginning  with  <u>sudoers</u>:  and  uses  this  to
       determine  the  search  order.   By default, <b>sudo</b> does not stop searching after the first match and later
       matches take precedence over earlier ones (unless ‘[SUCCESS=return]’ is used, see below).  The  following
       sources are recognized:

           files  read sudoers from <u><a href="file:/etc/sudoers">/etc/sudoers</a></u>
           ldap   read sudoers from LDAP

       In   addition,   a   subset   of   <u>nsswitch.conf</u>-style   action  statements  is  supported,  specifically
       ‘[SUCCESS=return]’ and ‘[NOTFOUND=return]’.  These will unconditionally terminate the search if the  user
       was either found ‘[SUCCESS=return]’ or not found ‘[NOTFOUND=return]’ in the immediately preceding source.
       Other action statements tokens are not supported, nor is test negation with ‘!’.

       To consult LDAP first followed by the local sudoers file (if it exists), use:

           sudoers: ldap files

       To consult LDAP only when no match is found in the local sudoers file (if it exists), use:

           sudoers: files [SUCCESS=return] ldap

       The local <u>sudoers</u> file can be ignored completely by using:

           sudoers: ldap

       If  the  <u><a href="file:/etc/nsswitch.conf">/etc/nsswitch.conf</a></u>  file  is  not  present or there is no sudoers line, the following default is
       assumed:

           sudoers: files

       The <u><a href="file:/etc/nsswitch.conf">/etc/nsswitch.conf</a></u> file is supported even when the underlying operating system does not  support  it,
       except on AIX (see below).

   <b>Configuring</b> <b>netsvc.conf</b>
       On AIX systems, the <u>/etc/netsvc.conf</u> file is consulted instead of <u><a href="file:/etc/nsswitch.conf">/etc/nsswitch.conf</a></u>.  <b>sudo</b> simply treats
       <u>netsvc.conf</u>  as  a  variant  of  <u>nsswitch.conf</u>; information in the previous section unrelated to the file
       format itself still applies.

       To consult LDAP first followed by the local sudoers file (if it exists), use:

           sudoers = ldap, files

       The local <u>sudoers</u> file can be ignored completely by using:

           sudoers = ldap

       To treat LDAP as authoritative and only use the local sudoers file if the user is not  present  in  LDAP,
       use:

           sudoers = ldap = auth, files

       In the above example, the <u>auth</u> qualifier only affects user lookups; both LDAP and <u>sudoers</u> will be queried
       for <u>Defaults</u> entries.

       If  the  <u>/etc/netsvc.conf</u>  file  is  not  present  or  there is no sudoers line, the following default is
       assumed:

           sudoers = files

   <b>Integration</b> <b>with</b> <b>sssd</b>
       On systems with the <u>System</u> <u>Security</u> <u>Services</u> <u>Daemon</u> (SSSD) and  where  <b>sudo</b>  has  been  built  with  SSSD
       support,  it is possible to use SSSD to cache LDAP <u>sudoers</u> rules.  To use SSSD as the <u>sudoers</u> source, you
       should use <u>sss</u> instead of <u>ldap</u> for the sudoers entry in <u><a href="file:/etc/nsswitch.conf">/etc/nsswitch.conf</a></u>.  The <u>/etc/sudo-ldap.conf</u> file
       is not used by the SSSD <b>sudo</b> back end.  See <u><a href="../man5/sssd-sudo.5.html">sssd-sudo</a></u>(5) for more information on configuring <b>sudo</b> to work
       with SSSD.

         #tls_cert /etc/certs/client_cert.pem
         #tls_key  /etc/certs/client_key.pem
         #
         # For Netscape-derived LDAP, tls_cert and tls_key may specify either
         # a directory, in which case the files in the directory must have the
         # default names (e.g., cert8.db and key4.db), or the path to the cert
         # and key files themselves.  However, a bug in version 5.0 of the LDAP
         # SDK will prevent specific file names from working.  For this reason
         # it is suggested that tls_cert and tls_key be set to a directory,
         # not a file name.
         #
         # The certificate database specified by tls_cert may contain CA certs
         # and/or the client's cert.  If the client's cert is included, tls_key
         # should be specified as well.
         # For backward compatibility, "sslpath" may be used in place of tls_cert.
