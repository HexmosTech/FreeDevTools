</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       torsocks.conf — Configuration file for <a href="../man8/torsocks.8.html">torsocks</a>(8)

</pre><h4><b>SUMMARY</b></h4><pre>
       By  default,  torsocks  will assume that it should connect to the Tor SOCKS proxy running at 127.0.0.1 on
       port 9050. This is the default address and port for Tor's socks server on most installations. If you  are
       running  a  normal Tor installation and have no special requirements, then you should not need to create,
       edit or invoke a configuration file when using torsocks.

       Your installation of torsocks includes a default configuration file that contains values sensible for use
       with most Tor installations. The installation location for your default configuration file is:

       /etc/tor/torsocks.conf

       In order to use a configuration file, you must set the environment variable TORSOCKS_CONF_FILE  with  the
       location of the file.

       If   TORSOCKS_CONF_FILE   is   not  set,  torsocks  will  attempt  to  read  the  configuration  file  at
       /etc/tor/torsocks.conf. If that file cannot be read, torsocks will use sensible  defaults  for  most  Tor
       installations, i.e. it will assume that you want to use a SOCKS proxy running at 127.0.0.1 (localhost) on
       port 9050.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>SYNTAX</b>
       The basic structure of all lines in the configuration file is:

              &lt;directive&gt; &lt;parameters&gt;

       Empty lines are ignored and all input on a line after a '#' character is ignored.

   <b>DIRECTIVES</b>
       The following directives are used in the torsocks configuration file:

       <u>TorAddress</u> <u>ip_addr</u>
              The  IP  address  of  the  Tor  SOCKS  server  (e.g "server = 10.1.4.253"). Only one server may be
              specified. Currently, torsocks does NOT support hostname.  (default: 127.0.0.1)

       <u>TorPort</u> <u>port</u>
              The port on which the Tor SOCKS server receives requests. (default: 9050)

       <u>OnionAddrRange</u> <u>subnet/mask</u>
              Tor hidden sites do not have real IP addresses. This specifies what range of IP addresses will  be
              handed  to  the  application as "cookies" for .onion names.  Of course, you should pick a block of
              addresses which you aren't going to ever need to actually connect  to.  This  is  similar  to  the
              MapAddress feature of the main tor daemon. (default: 127.42.42.0/24)

       <u>SOCKS5Username</u> <u>username</u>
              Username  to  use  for  SOCKS5  authentication  method  that makes the connections to Tor to use a
              different circuit from other existing streams. If set, the SOCKS5Password must be specified  also.
              (Default: none).

       <u>SOCKS5Password</u> <u>password</u>
              Password  to  use  for  SOCKS5  authentication  method  that makes the connections to Tor to use a
              different circuit from other existing streams. If set, the SOCKS5Username must be specified  also.
              (Default: none).

       <u>AllowInbound</u> <u>0|1</u>
              Allow  inbound  connections  meaning  that listen() and accept()/accept4() will be allowed for non
              localhost address so the application can handle incoming connection. Note  that  Unix  socket  are
              allowed. (Default: 0)

       <u>AllowOutboundLocalhost</u> <u>0|1|2</u>
              Allow  outbound  connections  to  the loopback interface meaning that connect() will be allowed to
              connect to localhost addresses bypassing Tor.  If set to 1, TCP connections will be  allowed.   If
              set to 2, both TCP/IP and UDP connections will be allowed.  This option should not be used by most
              users. (Default: 0)

       <u>IsolatePID</u> <u>0|1</u>
              Set  Torsocks  to  use an automatically generated SOCKS5 username/password based on the process ID
              and current time, that makes the connections to Tor use a different circuit  from  other  existing
              streams in Tor on a per-process basis.  If set, the SOCKS5Username and SOCKS5Password options must
              not be set. (Default: 0)
