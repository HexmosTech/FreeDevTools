       lcovrc - lcov configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>lcovrc</u> file contains configuration information for the <b>lcov</b> code coverage tool (see <b><a href="../man1/lcov.1.html">lcov</a></b>(1)).

       The  system-wide  configuration  file  is  located  at  <u>$LCOV_HOME/etc/lcovrc</u>.   This is typically either
       <u>/etc/lcovrc</u> or <u>/usr/local/etc/lcovrc</u> but may be wherever you have installed the lcov package.  To  change
       settings for a single user, place a customized copy of this file at location <u><a href="file:~/.lcovrc">~/.lcovrc</a></u>.  Where available,
       command-line options override configuration file settings.

       The  <u>genhtml,</u>  <u>lcov,</u>  and  <u>geninfo</u>  commands  also support the <u>--config-file</u> option, which can be used to
       specify one or more files which should be used instead of the system or user default rc files.   Multiple
       options files may be useful if you have both project- and team-specific common options and want to ensure
       consistency  across  multiple  users.   If  multiple  --config-file options are applied in the order they
       appear.  Note that the "--config-file" option name must be specified in full and cannot  be  abbreviated.
       An error will occur if the option is not recognized.

       Lines in a configuration file can either be:

            * empty lines or lines consisting only of white space characters. These lines are ignored.

            * comment  lines  which start with a hash sign ('#'). These are treated like empty lines and will be
              ignored.

            * statements in the form '<u>key</u> = <u>value</u>'.

            * Values may be taken from environment variables via the syntax

              '<u>key</u> = <u>...</u>$ENV{ENV_VAR_NAME}<u>...'.</u>

              The substring '$ENV{ENV_VAR_NAME}' is replaced by the value of the environment variable.

              One or more environment variables may be used to set the RC value.

       A list of valid statements and their description can be found in section 'OPTIONS' below.
       <b>NOTE</b> that there is no error checking of keys in the options file:  spelling errors  are  simply  seen  as
       values  which  are  not  used by some particular tool.  If you are unsure of whether your options file is
       read or its values applied, you can use the <u>--verbose</u> <u>--verbose</u> flag to enable printing of  option  value
       overrides.  (The option appears twice to enable a higher level of verbosity.)

       Both 'list' and 'scalar' (non list) options are supported in the lcovrc file.

       For scalar (non list) options:

            * if  specified  on the command line and in the lcovrc file, the value specified on the command line
              wins.  The value from the RC file is ignored.

            * Scalar  options  include:  'criteria_script  <u>=</u>  ...'   ,  'genhtml_annotate_script   <u>=</u>   ...'    ,
              'version_script <u>=</u> ...'  , etc.

       For list options:

            * the RC file entry can be used multiple times; each use appends to the list.
              For example, the entry below will result in two 'omit' patterns which will both be checked:

              # note explicit start/end line markers in the regexp
              omit_lines = ^\s+//\s*MY_EXCLUDE_MARKER\s*$
              # Note that the regexp below matches anywhere on the line
              omit_lines = NR_CM_DBG_PRINT

            * If  entries are specified on the command line, then the RC file entries are ignored:  command line
              wins.  If entries are specified in more than one RC file (i.e., multiple  --config-file  arguments
              are  supplied), then RC files are applied in order of appearance, and list entries are appended in
              order.  For most list-type options, order is not important.

            * list options include:
                  filter = <u>...</u>
                  exclude = <u>...</u>
                  ignore = <u>...</u>
                  substitute = <u>...</u>
                  omit_lines = <u>...</u>
                  erase_functions = <u>...</u>
                  genhtml_annotate_script = <u>...</u>
              <u>etc.</u>  For a complete set of list options, see the  documentation  of  each  configuration  option,
              below.

       <b>Example</b> <b>configuration:</b>

       Note that this example does not include all possible configuration options.
       In  general:   (almost)  all  command  line  options  can be specified in the configuration file instead,
       whereas some configuration file options have no command line equivalent.

       See the OPTIONS section below for details.

              Specify  an external style sheet file. Use this option to modify the appearance of the HTML output
              as generated by <b>genhtml</b>.  During output generation, a copy of this file  will  be  placed  in  the
              output directory.

              This option corresponds to the --css-file command line option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              By default, a standard CSS file is generated.

       <b>genhtml_header</b> = <u>string</u>

              Specify header text to use ta top of each HTML page.

              This option corresponds to the --header-title command line option of <b>genhtml</b>.
              Default is "LCOV - (differential )? coverage report"

       <b>genhtml_footer</b> = <u>string</u>

              Specify footer text to use at bottom of each HTML page.

              This option corresponds to the --footer command line option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default is LCOV tool version string.

       <b>genhtml_dark_mode</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If  non-zero,  display  using  light  text  on  dark  background  rather  than  dark text on light
              background.

              This option corresponds to the --dark-mode command line option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              By default, a 'light' palette is used.

       <b>genhtml_hi_limit</b>  = <u>hi_limit</u>
       <b>genhtml_med_limit</b> = <u>med_limit</u>

              Specify coverage rate limits for classifying file entries. Use this option to modify the  coverage
              rates (in percent) for line, function and branch coverage at which a result is classified as high,
              medium  or low coverage. This classification affects the color of the corresponding entries on the
              overview pages of the HTML output:

              High:   hi_limit  &lt;= rate &lt;= 100        default color: green
              Medium: med_limit &lt;= rate &lt; hi_limit    default color: yellow
              Low:    0         &lt;= rate &lt; med_limit   default color: red

              Defaults are 90 and 75 percent.

              There are also options to configure different thresholds for line, branch, and function coverages.
              See below.

       <b>genhtml_line_hi_limit</b>  = <u>line_hi_limit</u>
       <b>genhtml_line_med_limit</b> = <u>line_med_limit</u>

              Specify specific threshold for line coverage limits used  to  decide  whether  a  particular  line
              coverage  percentage  is classified as high, medium, or low coverage.  If the line-specific values
              are not specified, then the default <u>genhtml_med_limit</u> or <u>genhtml_hi_limit</u> values are used.

       <b>genhtml_branch_hi_limit</b>  = <u>branch_hi_limit</u>
       <b>genhtml_branch_med_limit</b> = <u>branch_med_limit</u>

              Specify specific threshold for branch coverage limits used to decide whether a  particular  branch
              coverage percentage is classified as high, medium, or low coverage.  If the branch-specific values
              are not specified, then the default <u>genhtml_med_limit</u> or <u>genhtml_hi_limit</u> values are used.

       <b>genhtml_function_hi_limit</b>  = <u>function_hi_limit</u>
       <b>genhtml_function_med_limit</b> = <u>function_med_limit</u>

              Specify  specific  threshold  for  function  coverage  limits  used to decide whether a particular
              function coverage percentage is classified as high, medium, or low  coverage.   If  the  function-
              specific values are not specified, then the default <u>genhtml_med_limit</u> or <u>genhtml_hi_limit</u> value is
              used.

       <b>rtl_file_extensions</b> = <u>str[,str]+</u>

              Specify  a  comma-separated  list of file extensions which should be assumed to be RTL code (e.g.,
              Verilog).

              If not specified, the default set is 'v,vh,sv,vhdl?'.  There is no command line option equivalent.
              This option is used by genhtml and lcov.

       <b>info_file_pattern</b> = <u>str</u>

              Specify a glob-match pattern associated with lcov trace files (suitable as an argument to  'find'.
              If not specified, the default is '*.info'.

       <b>c_file_extensions</b> = <u>str[,str]+</u>

              Specify a comma-separated list of file extensions which should be assumed to be C/C++ code.

              If  not  specified,  the  default set is 'c,h,i,C,H,I,icc,cpp,cc,cxx,hh,hpp,hxx'.  If you want all
              files to be treated as C/C++ code, you can use: <u>c_file_extensions</u> <u>=</u> <u>.*</u>

              This parameter must be set from the lcovrc file or via the <u>--rc</u> <u>name=value</u>  command  line  option;
              note that you may need to protect the value from shell expansion in the latter case.

       <b>java_file_extensions</b> = <u>str[,str]+</u>

              Specify a comma-separated list of file extensions which should be assumed to be Java code.

              If  not  specified,  the default set is 'java'.  If you want all files to be treated as Java code,
              you can use: <u>java_file_extensions</u> <u>=</u> <u>.*</u>

              This parameter must be set from the lcovrc file or via the <u>--rc</u> <u>name=value</u>  command  line  option;
              note that you may need to protect the value from shell expansion in the latter case.

       <b>perl_file_extensions</b> = <u>str[,str]+</u>

              Specify a comma-separated list of file extensions which should be assumed to be Perl code.

              If  not  specified, the default set is 'pl,pm'.  If you want all files to be treated as Perl code,
              you can use: <u>perl_file_extensions</u> <u>=</u> <u>.*</u>

              This parameter must be set from the lcovrc file or via the <u>--rc</u> <u>name=value</u>  command  line  option;
              note that you may need to protect the value from shell expansion in the latter case.

       <b>python_file_extensions</b> = <u>str[,str]+</u>

              Specify a comma-separated list of file extensions which should be assumed to be Python code.

              If  not  specified,  the default set is 'py'.  If you want all files to be treated as Python code,
              you can use: <u>python_file_extensions</u> <u>=</u> <u>.*</u>

              This parameter must be set from the lcovrc file or via the <u>--rc</u> <u>name=value</u>  command  line  option;
              note that you may need to protect the value from shell expansion in the latter case.

       <b>filter_lookahead</b> = <u>integer</u>

              Specify  the maximum number of lines to look at when filtering bogus branch expressions.  A larger
              number may catch more cases, but will increase execution time.

              If not specified, the default set is 10.  There is no command line option equivalent.
              This option is used by genhtml and lcov.

       <b>filter_bitwise_conditional</b> = <u>0|1</u>

              If set to non-zero value, bogus branch filtering will assume that expressions containing   bitwise
              operators '&amp;', '|', '~' are conditional expressions - and will not filter them out.

              If  not  specified,  the default set is 0 (do not treat them as conditional).  There is no command
              line option equivalent.
              This option is used by genhtml and lcov.

       <b>filter_blank_aggressive</b> = <u>0|1</u>

              If set to non-zero value, then blank source lines will be ignored whether or not their 'hit' count
              is zero.  See the <u>--filter</u> <u>blank</u> section in man <b><a href="../man1/genhtml.1.html">genhtml</a>(1).</b>

              If not specified, the default set is 0 (filter blank lines only if they are not hit).
              There is no command line option equivalent.

       <b>ignore_errors</b> = <u>message_type(,message_type)*</u>

              Specify a  message type which should be ignored.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to ignore multiple message types.

              This option is equivalent to the --ignore-errors option to geninfo, genhtml, or lcov.   Note  that
              the  lcovrc file message list is not applied (those messages NOT ignored) if the '--ignore-errors'
              command line option is specified.
              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       <b>expect_message_count</b> = <u>message_type:expr(,message_type:expr)*</u>

              Specify a constraint on the number of messages of one or more  types  which  are  expected  to  be
              produced  during  tool  execution.   If the constraint is not true, an error of type <u>count</u> will be
              generated.

              Multiple constraints can be specified using a comma-separated list or by using the option multiple
              times.

              Substitutions are performed on the expression before it is evaluated:

              For example:

          -  expect_message_count = inconsistent : %C == 5
             says that you expect exactly 5 messages of this type

          -  expect_message_count inconsistent : %C &gt; 6 &amp;&amp; %C &lt;= 10
             says that you expect the number of messages to be in the range (6:10].

       This option is useful if errors are caused by conditions that you  cannot  fix  -  for  example,  due  to
       inconsistent coverage data generated by your toolchain.  In those scenarios, you may decide:

          -  to exclude the offending code, or

          -  to exclude the entire offending file(s), or

          -  to ignore the messages, either by converting them to warnings or suppressing them entirely.

       In the latter case, this option provides some additional safety by warning you when the count differs due
       to some change which occurred, giving you the opportunity to diagnose the change and/or to review message
       changes.

       This option is equivalent to the <u>--expect-message-count</u> command line flag.

       <b>max_message_count</b> = <u>integer</u>

              Set  the  maximum  number  of warnings of any particular type which should be emitted. This can be
              used to reduce the size of log files.

              No more warnings will be printed after this number is reached.  0 (zero)  is  interpreted  as  'no
              limit'.
              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       <b>stop_on_error</b> = <u>0|1</u>

              If  set to 0, tell the tools to ignore errors and keep going to try to generate a result - however
              flawed or incomplete that result might be.  Note that some  errors  cannot  be  ignored  and  that
              ignoring some errors may lead to other errors.
              The tool will return a non-zero exit code if one or more errors are detected during execution when
              <u>stop_on_error</u>  is  disabled.   That is, the tool will continue execution in the presence of errors
              but will return an exit status.

              This is equivalent to the <u>'--keep-going'</u> command line option.

              Default is 1:  stop when error occurs.

              If the <u>'ignore_error</u> <u>msgType'</u> option is also used, then those messages will be treated as warnings
              rather than errors (or will be entirely suppressed if the message type appears multiple  times  in
              the ignore_messages option).  Warnings do not cause a non-zero exit status.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       <b>treat_warning_as_error</b> = <u>0|1</u>

              If  set  to 1, tell the tools that messages which are normally treated as warnings ( <u>e.g.,</u> certain
              usage messages) should be treated as errors.

              Note that ignored messages will still appear as warnings:  see the <u>ignore_errors</u> entry, above.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       <b>warn_once_per_file</b> = <u>0|1</u>

              If set to 1, tell the tools to emit certain errors only once per file (rather than multiple times,
              if the issue occurs multiple times in the same file).

              Default is 1:  do not report additional errors.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       <b>check_data_consistency</b> = <u>0|1</u>

              If set to 1, tell the tools to execute certain data consistency checks - <u>e.g.,</u> that function  with
              a non-zero hit count contains at least one line with a non-zero hit count - and vice versa.

              It  may  be useful to use this option to disable checking if you have inconsistent legacy data and
              have no way to correct or exclude it.

              Default is 1:  execute consistency checks.

       <b>genhtml_line_field_width</b> = <u>number_of_characters</u>

              Specify the width (in characters)  of  the  source  code  view  column  containing  line  coverage
              information.

              Default is 12.

       <b>genhtml_branch_field_width</b> = <u>number_of_characters</u>

              Specify  the  width  (in  characters)  of  the  source code view column containing branch coverage
              information.

              Default is 16.

       <b>genhtml_mcdc_field_width</b> = <u>number_of_characters</u>

              Specify the width (in characters) of  the  source  code  view  column  containing  MC/DC  coverage
              information.

              Default is 14.

       <b>genhtml_owner_field_width</b> = <u>number_of_characters</u>

              Specify  the width (in characters) of the source code view column containing owner information (as
              reported by your annotation script.  This option has an effect only if  you  are  using  a  source
              annotation script:  see the --annotation-script option in the genhtml man page.

              Default is 20.

       <b>genhtml_age_field_width</b> = <u>number_of_characters</u>

              Specify  the  width  (in  characters)  of  the  source  code  view  column  containing  age of the
              corresponding block (as reported by your annotation script).   This option has an effect  only  if
              you  are  using a source annotation script:  see the --annotation-script option in the genhtml man
              page.

              Default is 5.

       <b>genhtml_frames</b> = <u>0</u> <u>|</u> <u>1</u>

              Specify whether source detail view should contain a navigation image.  See the  <u>--frame</u>  entry  in
              the <b>genhtml</b> man page.

       <b>genhtml_overview_width</b> = <u>pixel_size</u>

              Specify  the  width (in pixel) of the overview image created when generating HTML output using the
              --frames option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default is 80.

       <b>genhtml_nav_resolution</b> = <u>lines</u>

              Specify the resolution of overview navigation when  generating  HTML  output  using  the  --frames
              option  of  <b>genhtml</b>.  This number specifies the maximum difference in lines between the position a
              user selected from the overview and the position the source code window is scrolled to.

              Default is 4.

       <b>genhtml_nav_offset</b> = <u>lines</u>

              Specify the overview navigation line offset as applied  when  generating  HTML  output  using  the
              --frames option of <b>genhtml.</b>

              Clicking a line in the overview image should show the source code view at a position a bit further
              up,  so  that  the requested line is not the first line in the window.  This number specifies that
              offset.

              Default is 10.

       <b>genhtml_keep_descriptions</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, keep unused test descriptions when generating HTML output using <b>genhtml</b>.

              This option corresponds to the --keep-descriptions option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default is 0.

       <b>genhtml_no_prefix</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, do not try to find and remove a common prefix from directory names.

              This option corresponds to the --no-prefix option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default is 0.

       <b>genhtml_no_source</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, do not create a source code view when generating HTML output using <b>genhtml</b>.

              This option corresponds to the --no-source option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default is 0.

       <b>genhtml_num_spaces</b> = <u>num</u>

              Specify the number of spaces to use as replacement for tab characters in the HTML source code view
              as generated by <b>genhtml</b>.

              This option corresponds to the --num-spaces option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default is 8.

       <b>genhtml_legend</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, include a legend explaining the meaning  of  color  coding  in  the  HTML  output  as

              This option corresponds to the --legend option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default is 0.

       <b>genhtml_html_prolog</b> = <u>filename</u>

              If set, include the contents of the specified file at the beginning of HTML output.

              This option corresponds to the --html-prolog option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default is to use no extra prolog.

       <b>genhtml_html_epilog</b> = <u>filename</u>

              If set, include the contents of the specified file at the end of HTML output.

              This option corresponds to the --html-epilog option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default is to use no extra epilog.

       <b>genhtml_html_extension</b> = <u>extension</u>

              If set, use the specified string as filename extension for generated HTML files.

              This option corresponds to the --html-extension option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default extension is "html".

       <b>genhtml_html_gzip</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If set, compress all html files using gzip.

              This option corresponds to the --html-gzip option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default extension is 0.

       <b>genhtml_sort</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If  non-zero,  create  overview  pages  sorted by coverage rates when generating HTML output using
              <b>genhtml</b>.

              This option can be set to 0 by using the --no-sort option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default is 1.

       <b>genhtml_hierarchical</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, the HTML report will follow the hierarchical directory structure of the source code.

              This option is equivalent to using the --hierarchical command line option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default is 0.

       <b>genhtml_flat_view</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, the top-level HTML table will contain all of the files in the project and there  will
              be no intermediate directory pages.

              This option is equivalent to using the --flat command line option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default is 0.

       <b>genhtml_show_navigation</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If  non-zero,  the 'source code' view summary table will contain hyperlinks from the number to the
              first source line in the corresponding category ('Hit'  or  'Not  hit')  in  the  non-differential
              coverage report.  Source code hyperlinks are always enabled in differential coverage reports.

              This option is equivalent to using the --show-navigation command line option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default is 0.

       <b>genhtml_show_owner_table</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>|<u>all</u>

              If non-zero, equivalent to the genhtml <u>--shwow-owners</u> flag: see man <b><a href="../man1/genhtml.1.html">genhtml</a>(1)</b> for details.

              Default is 0.

       <b>compact_summary_tables</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, suppress the 'Total' row in the 'date' and 'owner' summary table if there is only one
              element in the corresponding bin.
              When  there  are a large number of files with a single author, this can cut the summary table size
              by almost half.

              Default is 1 (enabled).

       <b>owner_table_entries</b> = <u>integer</u>

              This option is used to tell genhtml the number of 'owner' table entries to retain in  the  summary
              table  (at  the  top  of  the page) if owner table truncation is requested.  Authors are sorted by
              quantity of un-exercised code - so elided entries will be smaller offenders: maximal offenders are
              retained.  If the option is not set, then owner tables are not truncated.

              This option has no effect unless <u>genhtml</u> <u>--show-owners</u> is enabled.  See the  <u>--show-owners</u>  option
              in <b><a href="../man1/genhtml.1.html">genhtml</a>(1)</b> for details.

              Default is not set ( <u>i.e.,</u> do not truncate owner tables).

       <b>truncate_owner_table</b> = <u>comma_separated_list</u>

              This  option  is used to tell genhtml whether to truncate the 'owner' table at the top, directory,
              or file level.  This option acts together with the <u>owner_table_entries</u> parameter to determine  how
              many author entries are retained.

              This  option has no effect unless <u>genhtml</u> <u>--show-owners</u> is enabled and and the <u>owner_table_entries</u>
              configuration is set.

              If this option is set multiple times in the lcovrc file, the values are combined to form the  list
              of   levels   where   truncation   will   occur.   Similarly,  if  this  option  is  not  set  and
              <u>owner_table_entries</u> is set, then the table will be truncated everywhere.

              See the <u>--show-owners</u> option in <b><a href="../man1/genhtml.1.html">genhtml</a>(1)</b> for details.

              Default is to not truncate the list.

       <b>genhtml_show_noncode_owners</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, equivalent to the genhtml <u>--shwow-noncode</u> flag: see man <b><a href="../man1/genhtml.1.html">genhtml</a>(1)</b> for details.

              Default is 0.

       <b>genhtml_show_function_proportion</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If nonzero, add column to "function coverage detail" table to show the  proportion  of  lines  and
              branches within the function which are exercised.

              This option is equivalent to using the --show-proportion command line option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default is 0.

       <b>genhtml_synthesize_missing</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, equivalent to the genhtml <u>--synthesize-missing</u> flag: see man <b><a href="../man1/genhtml.1.html">genhtml</a>(1)</b> for details.

              Default is 0.

       <b>genhtml_charset</b> = <u>charset</u>

              Specify the character set of all generated HTML pages.

              Use this option if the source code contains characters which are not part of the default character
              set.  Note  that  this  option  is  ignored  when  a  custom  HTML  prolog  is specified (see also
              <b>genhtml_html_prolog</b>).

              Default is UTF-8.

       <b>demangle_cpp</b> = <u>c++filt</u>

              If set, this option tells  genhtml/lcov/geninfo  to  demangle  C++  function  names   in  function
              overviews, and gives the name of the tool used for demangling.  Set this option to one if you want
              to  convert  C++ internal function names to human readable format for display on the HTML function
              overview page.

              If the <u>demangle_cpp</u> option is used multiple times, then the arguments are  concatenated  when  the
              callback  is executed - similar to how the gcc <u>-Xlinker</u> parameter works.  This provides a possibly
              easier way to pass arguments to your tool, without requiring a wrapper script.  In that case, your
              callback will be executed as: <u>|</u> <u>tool-0</u> <u>'tool-1;</u> <u>...</u>  Arguments  are  quoted  when  passed  to  the
              shell, in order to handle parameters which contain spaces.

              Note  that  the demangling tool is called via a pipe, and is expected to read from stdin and write
              to stdout.

              This option corresponds to the --demangle-cpp command line option of <b>genhtml</b>.

              Default is not set (C++ demangling is disabled).

       <b>genhtml_demangle_cpp_tool</b> = <u>path_to_c++filt</u>

              Specify the location of the demangle tool (see <b>c++<a href="../man1/filt.1.html">filt</a></b>(1)) used to convert C++  internal  function
              names to human readable format for display on the HTML function overview page.

              This option is deprecated and will be removed from a future lcov release.  Please use <u>demangle_cpp</u>
              <u>=</u> <u>path_to_c++filt</u> instead.

       <b>genhtml_demangle_cpp_params</b> = <u>parameters</u>

              Specify extra parameters to be passed to the demangling tool

              Use  this  option if your environment requires additional parameters such as --no-strip-underscore
              for correctly demangling C++ internal function names. See also <b>c++<a href="../man1/filt.1.html">filt</a></b>(1)).

              This argument is deprecated.  Please use the Xlinker-like <u>demangle_cpp</u> argument instead.

       <b>genhtml_desc_html</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, test case descriptions may contain HTML markup.

              Set this option to one if you want to embed HTML markup (for example to  include  links)  in  test
              case  descriptions.  When  set to zero, HTML markup characters will be escaped to show up as plain
              text on the test case description page.

              Default is 0.

       <b>genhtml_precision</b> = <u>1</u>|<u>2</u>|<u>3</u>|<u>4</u>

              Specify how many digits after the decimal-point should be used for displaying coverage rates.

              Default is 1.

       <b>merge_function_aliases</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, group function aliases in the function detail tabile.  See <a href="../man1/man.1.html">man</a>(1) genhtml.

              Default is 0.

       <b>genhtml_missed</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, the count of missed lines, functions, or branches is shown  as  negative  numbers  in
              overview pages.

              Default is 0.

       <b>suppress_function_aliases</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, do not show aliases in the function detail table.
              If nonzero, implies that <b>merge_function_aliases</b> is enabled.
              See the genhtml man page for more details.

              Default is 0.

       <b>derive_function_end_line</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, use 'line' coverage data to deduce the end line of each function definition.  This is
              useful  when  excluding  certain  functions from your coverage report.  See the <u>--erase-functions,</u>
              <u>--filter</u> <u>trivial</u> and <u>--show-proportion</u> options.

              Default is 1.

              This option is not required if you are using  gcc/9  or  newer;  these  versions  report  function
              begin/end lines directly.

              Note     that     end    lines    are    derived    only    for    C/C++    files    unless    the
              <u>derive_function_end_lines_all_files</u> option is enabled; see the <u>c_file_extensions</u>  setting,  above,
              for the list of extensions used to identify C/C++ these files.
              Lambda  functions  are  ignored  during end line computation. Note that lambdas are identified via
              function name matching - so you must enable demangling if your toolchain  is  too  old  to  report
              demangled names in the GCOV output.  See the <u>demangle_cpp</u> setting, above.

              For  languages other than C/C++:  end-line derivation may compute the wrong value - <u>e.g.,</u> in cases
              where there are lines of code in global scope following some function definition.  In  this  case,
              lcov will incorrectly associate the following code with the preceding function.
              If this creates problems - for example, causes lcov to warn about inconsistent coveage data - then
              there are several possible workarounds:

              -  disable end-line derivation - <u>e.g.,</u> via <u>--rc</u> <u>derive_function_end_line=0</u> <u>.</u>

              -  exclude the offending code and/or then entire associated file.

              -  ignore the error message, <u>e.g.,</u> via the <u>--ignore-errors</u> command line option

              -  disable coverage DB consistency checks - <u>e.g.,</u> via <u>--rc</u> <u>check_data_consistency=0</u> <u>.</u>

       <b>derive_function_end_line_all_files</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If  non-zero,  derive end lines for all functions, regardless of source language.  By default, end
              lines are computed only in  C/C++ files.
              This option has no effect if <u>derive_function_end_lines</u> is disabled.

              Default is 0 (disabled).

       <b>trivial_function_threshold</b> = <u>integer</u>

              Set the maximum size of function (in number of lines) which will be checked  by  <u>--filter</u>  <u>trivial</u>
              <u>filter.</u>

              Default is 5.

       <b>excessive_count_threshold</b> = <u>number</u>

              Set  the  threshold for hit count that lcov deems excessive/unlikely/indicating a bug somewhere in
              your toolchain.
              tens of billions of hits.
              <b>excessive</b> is used to report potential issue - see the <b><a href="../man1/genhtml.1.html">genhtml</a>(1),</b> <b><a href="../man1/lcov.1.html">lcov</a>(1),</b> <b><a href="../man1/geninfo.1.html">geninfo</a>(1)</b> man pages.

              Default is not set. (Do not check for excessive counts.)

       <b>geninfo_gcov_tool</b> = <u>path_to_gcov</u>

              Specify the location of the gcov tool (see <b><a href="../man1/gcov.1.html">gcov</a></b>(1)) which is used to generate coverage information
              from data files.

              This option can be used multiple times - e.g., to add arguments to the  gcov  callback.   See  the
              geninfo man page for details.

       <b>geninfo_adjust_testname</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If  non-zero,   adjust  test names to include operating system information when capturing coverage
              data.

              Default is 0.

       <b>forget_testcase_names</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, ignore testcase names in .info file.  This may improve performance and reduce  memory
              consumption if user does not need per-testcase coverage summary in coverage reports.

              This is equivalent to the "--forget-test-names" lcov/genhtml option.

              Default is 0.

       <b>geninfo_checksum</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>
       <b>checksum</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, generate source code checksums when capturing coverage data.  Checksums are useful to
              prevent  merging  coverage  data  from  incompatible  source code versions but checksum generation
              increases the size of coverage files and the time used to generate those files.

              The backward compatible <u>geninfo_checksum</u> option is deprecated.  Please use <u>checksum</u> instead.   The
              new option is preferred as it is more clear that the option is used by lcov and genhtml as well as
              geninfo,

              This option can be overridden by the --checksum and --no-checksum command line options.

              Default is 0.

              Note  that  this  options is somewhat subsumed by the <u>version_script</u> option - which does something
              similar, but at the 'whole file' level.

       <b>geninfo_compat_libtool</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, enable libtool compatibility mode. When libtool compatibility mode is  enabled,  lcov
              will  assume  that the source code relating to a .da file located in a directory named ".libs" can
              be found in its parent directory.

              This option corresponds to the --compat-libtool and --no-compat-libtool  command  line  option  of
              <b>geninfo</b>.

              Default is 1.

       <b>geninfo_external</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, capture coverage data for external source files.

              External  source  files  are files which are not located in one of the directories (including sub-
              directories) specified by the --directory or --base-directory options of <b>lcov</b>/<b>geninfo</b>.   Also  see
              the  <u>--follow</u>  option and the <u>geninfo_follow_symlinks</u> and <u>geninfo_follow_file_links</u> for additional
              path controls.

              Default is 1.

       <b>geninfo_capture_all</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, capture coverage data from both runtime data files as well as compile time data files
              which have no corresponding runtime data.  See the <u>--all</u> flag description in  <b><a href="../man1/man.1.html">man</a>(1)</b>  <b>geninfo</b>  for
              more information.

              Default is 0:  do not process bare compile-time data files.

       <b>geninfo_external</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, capture coverage data for external source files.

              External  source  files  are files which are not located in one of the directories (including sub-
              directories) specified by the --directory or --base-directory options of <b>lcov</b>/<b>geninfo</b>.   Also  see
              the <u>--follow</u> option and the <u>geninfo_follow_file_links</u> for additional path controls.

              Default is 1.

       <b>geninfo_follow_symlinks</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              Equivalent to the lcov/geninfo <u>--follow</u> command line option.  See man <b><a href="../man1/geninfo.1.html">geninfo</a>(1)</b> for details.

              Default is 0:  do not modify follow symbolic links.

       <b>geninfo_follow_file_links</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If  non-zero  and  the  lcov/geninfo  <u>--follow</u>  command line option is specified, then source file
              pathnames which contain symlinks are resolved to  their  actual  target.   Note  that  the  parent
              directory of the link target may be considered 'external' and thus be removed by the <u>--no-external</u>
              flag.

              Default is 0:  do not modify pathnames.

       <b>geninfo_gcov_all_blocks</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, call the gcov tool with option --all-blocks.

              Using  --all-blocks will produce more detailed branch coverage information for each line. Set this
              option to zero if you do not need detailed branch coverage information to speed up the process  of
              capturing  code  coverage  or to work around a bug in some versions of gcov which will cause it to
              endlessly loop when analyzing some files.

              Default is 1.

       <b>geninfo_unexecuted_blocks</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, adjust the 'hit' count of lines which have  attribute  <u>unexecuted_block</u>  <u>:</u>  <u>true</u>  but
              which contain no branches and have a non-zero count.  Assume that these lines are not executed.

              Note that this option is effective only for gcov versions 9 and newer.

              Default is 0.

       <b>geninfo_compat</b> = <u>mode</u>=<u>value</u>[,<u>mode</u>=<u>value</u>,...]

              Specify that geninfo should enable one or more compatibility modes when capturing coverage data.

              This option corresponds to the --compat command line option of <b>geninfo</b>.

              Default is 'libtool=on, hammer=auto, split_crc=auto'.

       <b>geninfo_adjust_src_path</b> = <u>pattern</u> =&gt; <u>replacement</u>
       <b>geninfo_adjust_src_path</b> = <u>pattern</u>

              Adjust source paths when capturing coverage data.

              Use this option in situations where geninfo cannot find the correct path to source code files of a
              project.  By providing a <u>pattern</u> in Perl regular expression format (see <b><a href="../man1/perlre.1.html">perlre</a></b>(1)) and an optional
              replacement string, you can instruct geninfo to remove or change parts  of  the  incorrect  source
              path.

              <b>Example:</b>

              1. When geninfo reports that it cannot find source file

                  /path/to/src/.libs/file.c

              while the file is actually located in

                  /path/to/src/file.c

              use the following parameter:

                  geninfo_adjust_src_path = /.libs

              This will remove all "/.libs" strings from the path.

              2. When geninfo reports that it cannot find source file

                  /tmp/build/file.c

              while the file is actually located in

                  /usr/src/file.c

              use the following parameter:

                  geninfo_adjust_src_path = /tmp/build =&gt; <a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a>

              This will change all "/tmp/build" strings in the path to "<a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a>".

              The  <u>adjust_src_path</u>  option is similar to the <u>substitution</u> <u>=</u> <u>...</u>  option - which is somewhat more
              general and allows you to specify multiple substitution patterns.   Also  see  the  <u>resolve_script</u>
              option.

       <b>source_directory</b> = <u>dirname</u>

              Add  'dirname'  to  the  list of places to look for source files.  Also see the <u>--source-directory</u>
              entry in the <b>lcov,</b> <b>geninfo,</b> and <b>genhtml</b> man pages.

              For relative source file paths <u>e.g.,</u> found in some <u>tracefile</u> or in gcov output, first look for the
              path from 'cwd' (where genhtml was invoked) and then from each alternate  directory  name  in  the
              order specified.  The first location matching location is used.

              This option can be specified multiple times, to add more directories to the source search path.

              Note that the command line option overrides the RC file entries (if any).

       <b>build_directory</b> = <u>dirname</u>

              Add  'dirname' to the list of places to look for matching GCNO files (geninfo) or source file soft
              links (genhtml).  See the the <u>--build-directory</u> description in the <b>geninfo</b> and in the <b>genhtml</b>  man
              page.

              This option can be specified multiple times, to add more directories to the source search path.

              Note that the command line option overrides the RC file entries (if any).

       <b>geninfo_auto_base</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, apply a heuristic to determine the base directory when collecting coverage data.

              Use  this  option  when using geninfo on projects built with libtool or similar build environments
              that work with multiple base directories, i.e. environments, where the current  working  directory
              when invoking the compiler is not the same directory in which the source code file is located, and
              in addition, is different between files of the same project.

              Default is 1.

       <b>geninfo_intermediate</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>|<u>auto</u>

              Specify whether to use gcov intermediate format

              Use  this  option  to  control  whether  geninfo  should  use  the  gcov intermediate format while
              collecting coverage data. The use of the  gcov  intermediate  format  should  increase  processing
              speed. It also provides branch coverage data when using the --initial command line option.

              Valid values are 0 for off, 1 for on, and "auto" to let geninfo automatically use immediate format
              when supported by gcov.

              Default is "auto".

       <b>geninfo_no_exception_branch</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>
       <b>no_exception_branch</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              Specify  whether  to  exclude  exception  branches  from  branch  coverage.  Whether C++ exception
              branches are identified and removed is dependent on your compiler/toolchain correctly marking them
              in the generated coverage data.

              This option is used by lcov, geninfo, genhtml.

              The value <u>no_exception_branch</u> <u>=</u> <u>1</u> is equivalent to the <u>--filter</u> <u>exception</u> command line option.

              The  backward  compatible  <u>geninfo_no_exception_branch</u>   option   is   deprecated.    Please   use
              <u>no_exception_branch</u>  instead.   The new option is preferred as it is more clear that the option is
              used by lcov and genhtml as well as geninfo,

              Default is 0.

       <b>geninfo_chunk_size</b> = <u>integer</u>[%]

              Specify the number of GCDA files which should be processed per-call in each child  process.   This
              parameter  affects  the  balance  of  CPU time spent in the child and thus the number of completed
              child processes which are queued to be merged into the parent - which  then  affects  the  queuing
              delay.  Higher queuing delay lowers the effective parallelism.

              The  default  is  80%  of  <u>total_number_of_gcda_files</u>  <u>/</u>  <u>maximum_number_of_parallel_children,</u> the
              average number of files expected to be processed by each child.  See the <u>--parallel</u> entry  in  the
              <b>geninfo</b> man page.

              The  argument  may  be either an integer value to be used as the chunk size or a percentage of the
              average number files processed per child.

              This option has no effect unless the <u>--parallel</u> option has been specified.

       <b>geninfo_interval_update</b> = <u>integer</u>

              Seet the percentage of GCDA files which should  be  processed  between  console/progress  updates.
              This setting may be useful for parameter tuning and debugging apparent performance issues.

              The default is 5%.

              This option has no effect unless the <u>--parallel</u> option has been specified.

       <b>lcov_filter_chunk_size</b> = <u>integer</u>[%]

              Specify  the  number of source files which should be processed per-call in each child process when
              applying coverpoint filters - see the <b>filter</b>=<b>...</b>  parameter, below.  This  parameter  affects  the
              balance  of CPU time spent in the child and thus the number of completed child processes which are
              queued to be merged into the parent - which then affects the queuing delay.  Higher queuing  delay
              lowers the effective parallelism.

              The default is 80% of <u>total_number_of_source_files</u> <u>/</u> <u>maximum_number_of_parallel_children.</u>

              The  argument  may  be either an integer value to be used as the chunk size or a percentage of the
              average number files processed per child.

              This option has no effect unless the <u>--parallel</u> option has been specified and <b>lcov_filter_parallel</b>
              is not zero.

       <b>lcov_filter_parallel</b> = 0 | 1

              This option specifies whether coverpoint filtering should be done serially or in parallel.  If the
              number of files to process is very large, then parallelization may improve performance.

              This option has no effect unless the <u>--parallel</u> option has been specified.

              The default is 1 (enabled).

       <b>lcov_gcov_dir</b> = <u>path_to_kernel_coverage_data</u>

              Specify the path to the directory where kernel coverage data can be found or leave  undefined  for
              auto-detection.

              Default is auto-detection.

       <b>lcov_tmp_dir</b> = <u>temp</u>

              Specify the location of a directory used for temporary files.

              Default is '<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>'.

       <b>lcov_list_full_path</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              If non-zero, print the full path to source code files during a list operation.

              This option corresponds to the --list-full-path option of <b>lcov</b>.

              Default is 0.

       <b>lcov_list_max_width</b> = <u>width</u>

              Specify  the  maximum  width  for  list  output. This value is ignored when lcov_list_full_path is
              non-zero.

              Default is 80.

       <b>lcov_list_truncate_max</b>  <b>=</b> <u>percentage</u>

              Specify the maximum percentage of file names which may be  truncated  when  choosing  a  directory
              prefix in list output. This value is ignored when lcov_list_full_path is non-zero.

              Default is 20.

       <b>function_coverage</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              Specify whether lcov/geninfo/genhtml should generate, process, and display function coverage data.

              Turning  off  function  coverage by setting this option to 0 can sligly reduce memory and CPU time
              consumption when lcov is collecting and processing coverage data, as well as reduce  the  size  of
              the resulting data files.

              This  option  can be overridden by the <u>--function-coverage</u> and <u>--no-function-coverage</u> command line
              options.

              Backward-compatible RC options <b>lcov_function_coverage</b> and <b>genhtml_function_coverage</b> are  supported
              but deprecated.  Please use the new option instead.

              Default is 1.

       <b>branch_coverage</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              Specify whether lcov/geninfo should generate, process, and display branch coverage data.

              Turning off branch coverage by setting this option to 0 can reduce memory and CPU time consumption
              when  lcov is collecting and processing coverage data, as well as reduce the size of the resulting
              data files.

              This option can be overridden by the <u>--branch-coverage</u> and <u>--no-branch-coverage</u>
               command line options.

              Backward-compatible RC options <b>lcov_branch_coverage</b> and <b>genhtml_branch_coverage</b> are supported  but
              deprecated.  Please use the new option instead.

              Default is 0.

       <b>mcdc_coverage</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              Specify  whether  lcov/geninfo should generate, process, and display Modified Condition / Decision
              Coverage (MC/DC) coverage data.

              Turning off MC/DC coverage by setting this option to 0 can reduce memory and CPU time  consumption
              when  lcov is collecting and processing coverage data, as well as reduce the size of the resulting
              data files.

              This option can be overridden by the <u>--mcdc-coverage</u>
               command line option.

              Default is 0 (not enabled).

              See the MC/DC section of man <b><a href="../man1/genhtml.1.html">genhtml</a>(1)</b> for more details

       <b>lcov_excl_line</b> = <u>expression</u>

              Specify the regular expression of lines to exclude.  Line, branch, and  function  coverpoints  are
              associated with lines where this regexp is found are dropped.

              There are at least 2 (moderately) common use cases for custom exclusion markers:
              -  You  are  using multiple tools for coverage analysis, each of which has its own directives, and
              you don't want to complicate your source code with directives for each of them.
              - You want to exclude different regions/different types  of  code  in  different  contexts  -  for
              example, to ignore or not ignore debug/trace code depending on your team.

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_LINE'.

       <b>lcov_excl_br_line</b> = <u>expression</u>

              Specify  the  regular expression of lines to exclude from branch coverage.  Branch coverpoints are
              associated with lines where this regexp is found are dropped.  (Line and function coverpoints  are
              not affected.)

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_BR_LINE'.

       <b>lcov_excl_exception_br_line</b> = <u>expression</u>

              Specify  the  regular  expression  of lines to exclude from exception branch coverage.  Exception-
              related Branch coverpoints associated with lines where this regexp is found are  dropped.   (Line,
              function  coverpoints  are  not  affected.   Branch  coverpoints  which  are  not  associated with
              exceptions are also not affected.)

              Also see 'geninfo_no_exception_branch'; if nonzero, then all identified exception branches will be
              removed.

              Note that this feature requires support  from  your  compiler  -  and  thus  may  not  ignore  all
              exception-related coverpoints.

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_EXCEPTION_BR_LINE'.

       <b>lcov_excl_start</b> = <u>expression</u>

              Specify  the regexp mark the start of an exception region All coverpoints within exception regions
              are dropped.

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_START'.

       <b>lcov_excl_stop</b> = <u>expression</u>

              Specify the regexp mark the end of an exception region

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_STOP'.

       <b>lcov_excl_br_start</b> = <u>expression</u>

              Specify the regexp used to mark the start of a region where branch coverpoints are excluded.  Line
              and function coverpoints within the region are not excluded.

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_BR_START'.

       <b>lcov_excl_br_stop</b> = <u>expression</u>

              Specify the regexp used to mark the end of a region where branch coverpoints are excluded.

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_BR_STOP'.

       <b>lcov_excl_exception_br_start</b> = <u>expression</u>

              Specify the regexp used to mark the start of a region where  branch  coverpoints  associated  with
              exceptions  are  excluded.  Line, function, and non-exception branch coverpoints within the region
              are not excluded.

              Also see 'geninfo_no_exception_branch'; if nonzero, then all identified exception branches will be
              removed.

              Note that exception branch coverpoint identification requires support from  your  compiler  -  and
              thus may not ignore all exception-related coverpoints.

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_EXCEPTION_BR_START'.

       <b>lcov_excl_exception_br_stop</b> = <u>expression</u>

              Specify the regexp used to mark the end of a region where exception-related branch coverpoints are
              excluded.

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_EXECEPTION_BR_STOP'.

       <b>fail_under_branches</b> = <u>percentage</u>

              Specify   branch   coverage   threshold:    if  the  branch  coverage  is  below  this  threshold,
              lcov/genhtml/geninfo will generate all the normal result files and messages,  but  will  return  a
              non-zero exit code.

              This option is equivalent to the --fail-under-branches lcov/genhtml/geninfo command line argument.
              See <b>man</b> <b><a href="../man1/lcov.1.html">lcov</a>(1)</b> for more detailes.

              The default is 0 (no threshold).

       <b>fail_under_lines</b> = <u>percentage</u>

              Specify  line  coverage  threshold  to  lcov.   If  the  line  coverage  is  below this threshold,
              lcov/genhtml/geninfo will generate all the normal result files and messages,  but  will  return  a
              non-zero exit code.

              This option is equivalent to the --fail-under-lines lcov/genhtml/geninfo command line argument.

              The default is 0 (no threshold).

       <b>profile</b> = <u>filename</u>

              If  set, tells genhtml, lcov, or geninfo to generate some execution time/profile data which can be
              used to motivate future optimizations.  It is equivalent to the <u>--profile</u> command line option.

              If <u>filename</u> is empty, then  the  profile  is  written  to  the  default  location  chosen  by  the
              application.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

              The default is unset: no data generated.

       <b>parallel</b> = <u>integer</u>

              Tells  genhtml,  lcov, or geninfo the maximum number of simultaneous processes to use.  Zero means
              to use as many cores as are available on the machine.  The default is 1 (one)  -  which  means  to
              process sequentially (no parallelism).

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       <b>memory</b> = <u>integer_Mb</u>

              Tells  genhtml,  lcov, or geninfo the maximum memory to use during parallel processing operations.
              Effectively, the process will not fork() if this limit would be exceeded.  Zero means  that  there
              is no limit.  The default is 0 (zero) - which that there is no explicit limit.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       <b>memory_percentage</b> = <u>number</u>

              Tells  genhtml,  lcov, or geninfo the maximum memory to use during parallel processing operations.
              Maximum is computed as a percentage of the total memory available on the system; for example, '75'
              would use limit to 75% of total memory, whereas 150.5 would limit to 150.5% (  <u>i.e.,</u>  larger  than
              the  total  available.   Effectively, the process will not fork() if this limit would be exceeded.
              Note that this value is used only if the maximum memory value is not set explicitly - either by  a
              the <u>--memory</u> command line option or the <u>memory</u> <u>=</u> <u>integer</u> configuration file setting.

              The default is not not set.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       <b>max_fork_fails</b> = <u>integer</u>

              Tells  genhtml,  lcov,  or  geninfo  the  number  of  consecutive fork() failures to ignore during
              <u>--parallel</u> execution before giving up.  Note that genhtml/lcov/geninfo fail and  stop  immediately
              unless  the  <u>fork</u>  error  message  ignored  -  either via the <u>ignore_errors</u> directive (above), the
              <u>--ignore-errors</u> command line option, or if <u>stop_on_error</u> is disabled or the  <u>--keep-going</u>  command
              line option is used.

              The default fork failure maximum is 5.

       <b>fork_fail_timeout</b> = <u>integer_seconds</u>

              Tells genhtml, lcov, or geninfo how long to wait after a fork() failure before retrying.

              The default is 10 (seconds).

       <b>max_tasks_per_core</b> = <u>integer</u>

              This  is  the  maximum  number  of files that genhtml will handle in a single child process during
              parallel execution.

              The default is 20.

       <b>genhtml_date_bins</b> = <u>integer[,integer..]</u>

              This option is equivalent to the "genhtml --date-bins" option.  See man <b><a href="../man1/genhtml.1.html">genhtml</a>(1)</b> for details.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to set multiple cutpoints.

       <b>genhtml_datelabels</b> = <u>string[,string..]</u>

              This option is equivalent to the "genhtml --date-labels" option.  See man <b><a href="../man1/genhtml.1.html">genhtml</a>(1)</b> for details.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to set multiple labels.  The  number  of
              labels should equal one greater than number of cutpoints.

       <b>genhtml_annotate_script</b> = <u>path_to_executable</u>|<u>parameter</u>

              This option is equivalent to the "genhtml --annotate-script" option.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify both an annotation script and
              additional options which are passed to the script.

              See the genhtml man page for details.

       <b>genhtml_annotate_tooltip</b> = <u>tooltip_string</u>

              This option sets the 'tooltip' popup which appears if user hovers mouse over the associated source
              code.  Note that the tooltop is generated only if the annotation-script callback is successful and
              returns  a  commit ID other than "NONE".  Set <u>tooltip_string</u> to "" (empty string) to force genhtml
              to not produce the tooltip.

              Substitutions are performed on <u>tooltip_string:</u>

              %C:
              commit ID (from annotate callback - see <u>--anotate-script</u> entry in the <b>genhtml</b> man page)

              %U:
              commit author abbreviated name (returned by annotate callback)

              %F:
              commit author full name (returned by annotate callback)

              %D:
              commit date (as returned by annotate callback)

              %d:
              commit date with time of day removed (i.e., date part only)

              %A:
              commit age.

              %l
              source line number.

       <b>context_script</b> = <u>path_to_executable_or_module</u>|<u>parameter</u>

              This option is equivalent to the <u>--context-script</u> option of genhtml/lcov/geninfo

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify both a  criteria  script  and
              additional options which are passed to the script.

              See the genhtml man page for details.

       <b>criteria_script</b> = <u>path_to_executable_or_module</u>|<u>parameter</u>

              This option is equivalent to the <u>--criteria-script</u> option of genhtml/lcov/geninfo

              This  option  can  be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify both a criteria script and
              additional options which are passed to the script.

              See the genhtml man page for details.

       <b>criteria_callback_data</b> = <u>comma_separated_list</u>

              This option is used to tell genhtml whether you want date and/or owner summary data passed back to
              your criteria callback.  Note that summary data is always passed.

              Note that lcov and geninfo do not record date or owner data -  and  so  do  not  pass  it  to  the
              callback.

              This  option  can  be  used  multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify both date and owner data
              should be returned, or you can specify both in a  comma-separated list.  Date  and/or  owner  data
              will be returned if and only if your genhtml command has enabled annotation.

              If  this  option is appears multiple times in the lcovrc file; the values are combined to form the
              list of binning types which are passed to your callback.

              See the genhtml man page for details.

       <b>criteria_callback_levels</b> = <u>comma_separated_list</u>

              This option is used to tell genhtml whether criteria callbacks should occur at the top, directory,
              or file level.

              If this option is appears multiple times in the lcovrc file, the values are combined to  form  the
              list of report levels when your callback will be executed.

              See the genhtml man page for details.

       <b>check_existence_before_callback</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              This  option  configures the tool to check that the file exists before calling the <u>annotate-script</u>
              or <u>version-script</u> callback.  If set and file does not exist, a <b>source</b> error is  triggered.   (Note
              that the error may be ignored - see the <u>--ignore-error</u> option.)

              You  may want to NOT check for file existence if your callback looks up information in a non-local
              repository.

              The default is 1 (check for file existence).

       <b>compute_file_version</b> = <u>0</u>|<u>1</u>

              This option is used to tell the tool to generate missing file version information when  reading  a
              .info  (coverage data) file.  Version information may be missing because the data was generated by
              a tool which did not support versioning, or because the data was generated  without  the  required
              <u>--version-script</u> argument - or for some other reason.

              Note  that  this  option  has  no effect without a version-script callback - defined by either the
              <u>--version-script</u> command line option or the <u>version_script</u> config file option.

              The default is 0:  do not generate missing information.

       <b>version_script</b> = <u>path_to_executable</u>|<u>parameter</u>

              This option is equivalent to the geninfo/lcov/genhtml "--version-script" option.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify both  a  version  script  and
              additional options which are passed to the script.

              See the genhtml man page for details.

       <b>resolve_script</b> = <u>path_to_executable</u>|<u>parameter</u>

              This option is equivalent to the geninfo/lcov/genhtml "--resolve-script" option.

              This  option  can  be  used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify both a resolve script and
              additional options which are passed to the script.

              The resolve script provides a mechanism to find a source or data file  that  cannot  be  found  by
              simply  modify  paths  via  substitution  patterns  (see  <u>substitute</u>  <u>=</u>  <u>replace_regexp</u> above) and
              searching along the corresponding directory list:

                     <b>geninfo:</b> the <u>'build_directory</u> <u>=</u> <u>dirname'</u> config file  entry  or  <u>--build=directory</u>  command
                     line option, used to search for GCNO files,

                     <b>geninfo/genhtml/lcov:</b>   the   <u>'source_directory</u>   <u>=</u>   <u>dirname'</u>   config   file   entry   or
                     <u>--source=directory</u> command line option, used to search for source files.

              The resolve script is called as:

                     <b>resolve_script</b> [callback_args]  <u>file_name</u>

              or

                     <u>$resolve_callback</u> <u>=</u> <b>resolve_module</b> <u>-&gt;new([callback_args])</u>

              to initialize the callback, then

                     <u>$resolve_callback-&gt;</u> <b>resolve</b> <u>(file_name)</u>

              to find the actual file location.

              If necessary, the callback can check the suffix of the filename to  determine  whether  it  should
              look for either a source or data file.

              The  script  should  return  either  empty string (file not found/no such file) or the actual path
              name.  The returned path may be either absolute or relative to CWD.

       <b>select_script</b> = <u>path_to_executable</u>|<u>parameter</u>

              This option is equivalent to the genhtml "--select-script" option.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify  both  a  select  script  and
              additional options which are passed to the script.

              The select script provides a mechanism to decide whether a particular source line is interesting -
              whether it should be included in the generated coverage report - or not.

              Lines  which  are  not  selected  but  fall  within  <u>num_context_lines</u> of a selected line are also
              included in the report.  See below.

              Note that selection is fundamentally intended to  show  regions  of  code  with  some  surrounding
              context.   It  might  not do what you expect if there is no code - e.g., if the region of interest
              has been compiled out via compiler or exclusion directives.  For example: when selecting based  on
              SHA   or   changelist  ID,  an  inserted  comment  will  not  be  selected  unless  it  is  within
              <u>num_context_lines</u> of an inserted or changed line of code.

              The select script is called as:

                 <b>select_script</b> [callback_args] <u>lineDataJson</u> <u>annotateDataJson</u> <u>fileName</u> <u>lineNumber</u>

              or as:

                 <u>$selectCallback</u> <u>=</u> <b>select_module</b> <u>-&gt;new([callback_args])</u>

              to initialize the callback object, then as

                  <u>$selectCallback</u> <b>select</b> <u>(lineDataRef</u> <u>annotateDataRef</u> <u>fileName</u> <u>lineNumber)</u>

              to determine selection, where

              -  <u>fileName</u> is the name of the source file and

              -  <u>lineNumber</u> is the source file line number, indexed from zero,

              -  <u>lineDataJson</u> is a json-encoded LineData structure (see the lcovutil.pm source code), and

              -  <u>annotateDataJson</u>  is  the  json-encoded  data  returned  by  your  <u>annotate-script</u>   (see   the
                 <u>--annotate-script</u>  parameter  in  man  <b><a href="../man1/genhtml.1.html">genhtml</a>(1).</b>   ),  or  the  empty  string if there are no
                 annotations for this file.

              The module callback is similar except that is is passed objects rather than JSON encodings of  the
              objects.

       The script should return "1" or "0".

       See example implementation <u>$LCOV_HOME/share/lcov/support-scripts/select.pm.</u>

       <b>num_context_lines</b> = <u>integer</u>

              Set  the  number  of  lines  around  each  selected  line  which  is  included in the report - see
              <u>select_script</u> <u>=</u> <u>...</u>  above and the <u>--select-script</u> command line option in man <b><a href="../man1/genhtml.1.html">genhtml</a>(1).</b>

       <b>filter</b> = <u>str[,str...]</u>

              This option is equivalent to the --filter option to geninfo, lcov, and genhtml.  See  the  genhtml
              man page for details.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to enable multiple filters.  The filters
              specified in the lcovrc file are appended to the list specified on the command line.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       <b>exclude</b> = <u>glob_pattern</u>

              This option is equivalent to the --exclude option to geninfo, lcov, and genhtml.  See the lcov man
              page for details.;

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify multiple patterns to exclude.
              The patterns specified in the lcovrc file are appended to the list specified on the command line.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       <b>include</b> = <u>glob_pattern</u>

              This option is equivalent to the --include option to geninfo, lcov, and genhtml.  See the lcov man
              page for details.;

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify multiple patterns to include.
              The patterns specified in the lcovrc file are appended to the list specified on the command line.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       <b>substitute</b> = <u>regexp</u>

              This  option is equivalent to the --substitute option to geninfo, lcov, and genhtml.  See the lcov
              man page for details.;

              This option can be used multiple times  in  the  lcovrc  file  to  specify  multiple  substitution
              patterns.   The  patterns  specified  in the lcovrc file are appended to the list specified on the
              command line.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       <b>omit_lines</b> = <u>regexp</u>

              This option is equivalent to the --omit-lines option to  geninfo,  lcov,  and  genhtml.   See  the
              genhtml man page for details.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify multiple patterns to exclude.
              The patterns specified in the lcovrc file are appended to the list specified on the command line.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       <b>erase_functions</b> = <u>regexp</u>

              This  option is equivalent to the --erase-functions option to geninfo, lcov, and genhtml.  See the
              genhtml man page for details.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify multiple patterns to exclude.
              The patterns specified in the lcovrc file are appended to the list specified on the command line.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       <b>lcov_json_module</b> = <u>module</u>|<u>auto</u>

              Specify the JSON module to use, or choose best available from a set  of  alternatives  if  set  to
              'auto'.  Note  that  some  JSON  modules are slower than others (notably JSON::PP can be very slow
              compared to JSON::XS).

              Default is 'auto'.

       <b>split_char</b> = <u>char</u>

              Specify the character (or regexp) used to split list-like parameters which have been passed  as  a
              single  string.   This  parameter  is  useful in the case that you need want to use a multi-option
              string but one or more of the options contains a comma character which would otherwise be seen  as
              a delimiter.

              Default is ',' (comma - no quotes).

       <b>scope_regexp</b> = <u>regexp</u>

              Print debug messages for data in filenames which match <u>regexp.</u>
              Only  certain  categories  of message are logged; the set changes from time to time - depending on
              debug need.

       <b>case_insensitive</b> = <u>[0|1]</u>

              Specify whether string comparison is case insensitive when finding  matching  filenames,  checking
              include/exclude directives, etc.

              Note  that  mixed-case  or  lower-case  pathnames  may  be  passed  to  your  --version-script and
              --annotate-script callbacks when case-insensitive matching is used.  Your  callbacks  must  handle
              potential differences in case.

              Default is '0':  case sensitive matching.
