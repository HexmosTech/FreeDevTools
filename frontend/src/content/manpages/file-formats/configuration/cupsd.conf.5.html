</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cupsd.conf - server configuration file for cups

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>cupsd.conf</u>  file  configures  the CUPS scheduler, <b><a href="../man8/cupsd.8.html">cupsd</a></b>(8).  It is normally located in the <u>/etc/cups</u>
       directory.  Each line in the file can  be  a  configuration  directive,  a  blank  line,  or  a  comment.
       Configuration  directives  typically  consist  of a name and zero or more values separated by whitespace.
       The configuration directive name and values  are  case-insensitive.   Comment  lines  start  with  the  #
       character.

   <b>TOP-LEVEL</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b>
       The following top-level directives are understood by <b><a href="../man8/cupsd.8.html">cupsd</a></b>(8):

       <b>AccessLogLevel</b> <b>config</b>

       <b>AccessLogLevel</b> <b>actions</b>

       <b>AccessLogLevel</b> <b>all</b>
            Specifies  the  logging  level  for  the  AccessLog file.  The "config" level logs when printers and
            classes are added, deleted, or modified and when configuration files are accessed or  updated.   The
            "actions"  level  logs when print jobs are submitted, held, released, modified, or canceled, and any
            of the conditions for "config".  The "all" level logs all requests.  The default access log level is
            "actions".

       <b>AutoPurgeJobs</b> <b>Yes</b>

       <b>AutoPurgeJobs</b> <b>No</b>
            Specifies whether to purge job history data automatically when it is no longer required for  quotas.
            The default is "No".

       <b>BrowseDNSSDSubTypes_</b><u>subtype[,...]</u>
            Specifies  a  list  of  Bonjour  sub-types  to  advertise  for  each  shared  printer.  For example,
            "BrowseDNSSDSubTypes _cups,_print" will  tell  network  clients  that  both  CUPS  sharing  and  IPP
            Everywhere  are  supported.   The  default is "_cups" which is necessary for printer sharing to work
            between systems using CUPS.

       <b>BrowseLocalProtocols</b> <b>all</b>

       <b>BrowseLocalProtocols</b> <b>dnssd</b>

       <b>BrowseLocalProtocols</b> <b>none</b>
            Specifies which protocols to use for local printer sharing.  The default is "dnssd" on systems  that
            support Bonjour and "none" otherwise.

       <b>BrowseWebIF</b> <b>Yes</b>

       <b>BrowseWebIF</b> <b>No</b>
            Specifies whether the CUPS web interface is advertised.  The default is "No".

       <b>Browsing</b> <b>Yes</b>

       <b>Browsing</b> <b>No</b>
            Specifies whether shared printers are advertised.  The default is "No".

       <b>DefaultAuthType</b> <b>Basic</b>
            Specifies the default type of authentication to use.  The default is "Basic".

       <b>DefaultEncryption</b> <b>Never</b>

       <b>DefaultEncryption</b> <b>IfRequested</b>

       <b>DefaultEncryption</b> <b>Required</b>
            Specifies whether encryption will be used for authenticated requests.  The default is "Required".

       <b>DefaultLanguage</b> <u>locale</u>
            Specifies the default language to use for text and web content.  The default is "en".

       <b>DefaultPaperSize</b> <b>Auto</b>

       <b>DefaultPaperSize</b> <b>None</b>

       <b>DefaultPaperSize</b> <u>sizename</u>
            Specifies  the default paper size for new print queues. "Auto" uses a locale-specific default, while
            "None" specifies there is no default paper size.  Specific size  names  are  typically  "Letter"  or
            "A4".   The  default is "Auto".  Note: The default paper size must use a size name from the PPD file
            and not a PWG self-describing media size name.

       <b>DefaultPolicy</b> <u>policy-name</u>
            Specifies the default access policy to use.  The default access policy is "default".

       <b>DefaultShared</b> <b>Yes</b>

       <b>DefaultShared</b> <b>No</b>
            Specifies whether local printers are shared by default.  The default is "Yes".

       <b>DirtyCleanInterval</b> <u>seconds</u>
            Specifies the delay for updating of configuration and state files.  A value of 0 causes  the  update
            to happen as soon as possible, typically within a few milliseconds.  The default value is "30".

       <b>DNSSDHostName</b><u>hostname.example.com</u>
            Specifies  the  fully-qualified  domain  name  for the server that is used for Bonjour sharing.  The
            default is typically the server's ".local" hostname.

       <b>ErrorPolicy</b> <b>abort-job</b>
            Specifies that a failed print job should be aborted (discarded) unless otherwise specified  for  the
            printer.

       <b>ErrorPolicy</b> <b>retry-current-job</b>
            Specifies  that  a failed print job should be retried immediately unless otherwise specified for the
            printer.

       <b>ErrorPolicy</b> <b>retry-job</b>
            Specifies that a failed print job should be retried at a later time unless otherwise  specified  for
            the printer.

       <b>ErrorPolicy</b> <b>stop-printer</b>
            Specifies  that  a  failed  print  job  should  stop  the printer unless otherwise specified for the
            printer. The 'stop-printer' error policy is the default.

       <b>FilterLimit</b> <u>limit</u>
            Specifies the maximum cost of filters that are run concurrently, which can be used to minimize disk,
            memory, and CPU resource problems.  A limit of 0 disables filter limiting.  An average  print  to  a
            non-PostScript  printer  needs  a  filter limit of about 200.  A PostScript printer needs about half
            that (100).  Setting the limit below these  thresholds  will  effectively  limit  the  scheduler  to
            printing a single job at any time.  The default limit is "0".

       <b>FilterNice</b> <u>nice-value</u>
            Specifies the scheduling priority ( <b><a href="../man8/nice.8.html">nice</a></b>(8) value) of filters that are run to print a job.  The nice
            value ranges from 0, the highest priority, to 19, the lowest priority.  The default is 0.

       <b>HostNameLookups</b> <b>On</b>

       <b>HostNameLookups</b> <b>Off</b>

       <b>HostNameLookups</b> <b>Double</b>
            Specifies whether to do reverse lookups on connecting clients.  The "Double" setting causes <b><a href="../man8/cupsd.8.html">cupsd</a></b>(8)
            to verify that the hostname resolved from the address matches one of the addresses returned for that
            hostname.   Double  lookups also prevent clients with unregistered addresses from connecting to your
            server.  The default is "Off" to avoid the  potential  server  performance  problems  with  hostname
            lookups.  Only set this option to "On" or "Double" if absolutely required.

       <b>IdleExitTimeout</b> <u>seconds</u>
            Specifies  the  length  of time to wait before shutting down due to inactivity.  The default is "60"
            seconds.  Note: Only applicable when <b><a href="../man8/cupsd.8.html">cupsd</a></b>(8) is run on-demand (e.g., with <b>-l</b>).

       <b>JobKillDelay</b> <u>seconds</u>
            Specifies the number of seconds to wait before killing the filters and  backend  associated  with  a
            canceled or held job.  The default is "30".

       <b>JobRetryInterval</b> <u>seconds</u>
            Specifies  the  interval  between retries of jobs in seconds.  This is typically used for fax queues
            but can also be used with normal print queues whose error policy is  "retry-job".   The  default  is
            "30".

       <b>JobRetryLimit</b> <u>count</u>
            Specifies  the  number of retries that are done for jobs.  This is typically used for fax queues but
            can also be used with normal print queues whose error policy is "retry-job".  The default is "5".

       <b>KeepAlive</b> <b>Yes</b>

       <b>KeepAlive</b> <b>No</b>
            Specifies whether to support HTTP keep-alive connections.  The default is "Yes".

       <b>&lt;Limit</b> <u>operation</u> ...<b>&gt;</b> ... <b>&lt;/Limit&gt;</b>
            Specifies the IPP operations that are being limited inside a Policy section. IPP operation names are
            listed below in the section "IPP OPERATION NAMES".

       <b>&lt;Limit</b> <u>method</u> ...<b>&gt;</b> ... <b>&lt;/Limit&gt;</b>

       <b>&lt;LimitExcept</b> <u>method</u> ...<b>&gt;</b> ... <b>&lt;/LimitExcept&gt;</b>
            Specifies the HTTP methods that are being limited inside a Location section. HTTP method  names  are
            listed below in the section "HTTP METHOD NAMES".

       <b>LimitRequestBody</b> <u>size</u>
            Specifies  the  maximum  size  of print files, IPP requests, and HTML form data.  The default is "0"
            which disables the limit check.

       <b>Listen</b> <u>ipv4-address</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>

       <b>Listen</b> <b>[</b><u>ipv6-address</u><b>]:</b><u>port</u>

       <b>Listen</b> <b>*:</b><u>port</u>

       <b>Listen</b> <u>/path/to/domain/socket</u>
            Listens to the specified address and port or domain socket path for  connections.   Multiple  Listen
            directives  can be provided to listen on multiple addresses.  The Listen directive is similar to the
            Port directive but allows you to restrict access to specific interfaces or networks.  Note:  "Listen
            *:<u>port</u>"  and  "Port  <u>port</u>"  effectively  listen on all IP addresses, so you cannot combine them with
            Listen directives for explicit IPv4 or IPv6 addresses on the same port.

       <b>&lt;Location</b> <u>/path</u><b>&gt;</b> ... <b>&lt;/Location&gt;</b>
            Specifies access control for the  named  location.   Paths  are  documented  below  in  the  section
            "LOCATION PATHS".

       <b>LogDebugHistory</b> <u>number</u>
            Specifies  the  number  of  debugging messages that are retained for logging if an error occurs in a
            print job. Debug messages are logged regardless of the LogLevel setting.

       <b>LogLevel</b> none

       <b>LogLevel</b> emerg

       <b>LogLevel</b> alert

       <b>LogLevel</b> crit

       <b>LogLevel</b> error

       <b>LogLevel</b> warn

       <b>LogLevel</b> notice

       <b>LogLevel</b> info

       <b>LogLevel</b> debug

       <b>LogLevel</b> debug2
            Specifies the level of logging for the ErrorLog file.  The value  "none"  stops  all  logging  while
            "debug2" logs everything.  The default is "warn".

       <b>LogTimeFormat</b> standard

       <b>LogTimeFormat</b> usecs
            Specifies the format of the date and time in the log files.  The value "standard" is the default and
            logs whole seconds while "usecs" logs microseconds.

       <b>MaxClients</b> <u>number</u>
            Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous clients that are allowed by the scheduler.  The default
            is "100".

       <b>MaxClientsPerHost</b> <u>number</u>
            Specifies  the  maximum  number of simultaneous clients that are allowed from a single address.  The
            default is the MaxClients value.

       <b>MaxCopies</b> <u>number</u>
            Specifies the maximum number of copies that a user can print of each job.  The default is "9999".

       <b>MaxHoldTime</b> <u>seconds</u>
            Specifies the maximum time a job may remain in the "indefinite" hold state before  it  is  canceled.
            The default is "0" which disables cancellation of held jobs.

       <b>MaxJobs</b> <u>number</u>
            Specifies  the  maximum  number  of  simultaneous  jobs  that  are  allowed.  Set to "0" to allow an
            unlimited number of jobs.  The default is "500".

       <b>MaxJobsPerPrinter</b> <u>number</u>
            Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous jobs that are allowed per printer.  The default is  "0"
            which allows up to MaxJobs jobs per printer.

       <b>MaxJobsPerUser</b> <u>number</u>
            Specifies  the  maximum  number  of simultaneous jobs that are allowed per user.  The default is "0"
            which allows up to MaxJobs jobs per user.

       <b>MaxJobTime</b> <u>seconds</u>
            Specifies the maximum time a job may take to print before it is canceled.  Set  to  "0"  to  disable
            cancellation of "stuck" jobs.  The default is "10800" (3 hours).

       <b>MaxLogSize</b> <u>size</u>
            Specifies  the  maximum  size  of the log files before they are rotated.  The value "0" disables log
            rotation.  The default is "1048576" (1MB).

       <b>MaxSubscriptions</b> <u>number</u>
            Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous event subscriptions that are allowed.  Set  to  "0"  to
            allow an unlimited number of subscriptions.  The default is "100".

       <b>MaxSubscriptionsPerJob</b> <u>number</u>
            Specifies  the  maximum  number  of  simultaneous event subscriptions that are allowed per job.  The
            default is "0" which allows up to MaxSubscriptions subscriptions per job.

       <b>MaxSubscriptionsPerPrinter</b> <u>number</u>
            Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous event subscriptions that are allowed per printer.   The
            default is "0" which allows up to MaxSubscriptions subscriptions per printer.

       <b>MaxSubscriptionsPerUser</b> <u>number</u>
            Specifies  the  maximum  number  of simultaneous event subscriptions that are allowed per user.  The
            default is "0" which allows up to MaxSubscriptions subscriptions per user.

       <b>MultipleOperationTimeout</b> <u>seconds</u>
            Specifies the maximum amount of time to allow between files in  a  multiple  file  print  job.   The
            default is "900" (15 minutes).

       <b>&lt;Policy</b> <u>name</u><b>&gt;</b> ... <b>&lt;/Policy&gt;</b>

       <b>PreserveJobFiles</b> <b>Yes</b>

       <b>PreserveJobFiles</b> <b>No</b>

       <b>PreserveJobFiles</b> <u>seconds</u>
            Specifies whether job files (documents) are preserved after a job is printed.  If a numeric value is
            specified,  job files are preserved for the indicated number of seconds after printing.  The default
            is "86400" (preserve 1 day).

       <b>PreserveJobHistory</b> <b>Yes</b>

       <b>PreserveJobHistory</b> <b>No</b>

       <b>PreserveJobHistory</b> <u>seconds</u>
            Specifies whether the job history is preserved after a job  is  printed.   If  a  numeric  value  is
            specified,  the  job  history  is  preserved for the indicated number of seconds after printing.  If
            "Yes", the job history is preserved until the MaxJobs limit is reached.  The default is "Yes".

       <b>ReadyPaperSizes</b> <u>sizename[,...]</u>
            Specifies a list of potential paper sizes that are reported as "ready" (loaded).   The  actual  list
            will only contain sizes that each printer supports.  The default is "Letter,Legal,Tabloid,4x6,Env10"
            when  the  default paper size is "Letter" and "A3,A4,A5,A6,EnvDL" otherwise.  Note: Paper sizes must
            use the size names from the PPD file and not PWG self-describing media size names.

       <b>ReloadTimeout</b> <u>seconds</u>

            Specifies the email address of the server administrator.  The default value is "root@ServerName".

       <b>ServerAlias</b> <u>hostname</u> [ ... <u>hostname</u> ]

       <b>ServerAlias</b> <b>*</b>
            The  ServerAlias  directive  is  used  for  HTTP  Host header validation when clients connect to the
            scheduler from external interfaces.  Using the special name "*" can  expose  your  system  to  known
            browser-based  DNS  rebinding  attacks,  even when accessing sites through a firewall.  If the auto-
            discovery of alternate names does not  work,  we  recommend  listing  each  alternate  name  with  a
            ServerAlias directive instead of using "*".

       <b>ServerName</b> <u>hostname</u>
            Specifies  the  fully-qualified  hostname  of  the server.  The default is the value reported by the
            <b><a href="../man1/hostname.1.html">hostname</a></b>(1) command.

       <b>ServerTokens</b> <b>None</b>

       <b>ServerTokens</b> <b>ProductOnly</b>

       <b>ServerTokens</b> <b>Major</b>

       <b>ServerTokens</b> <b>Minor</b>

       <b>ServerTokens</b> <b>Minimal</b>

       <b>ServerTokens</b> <b>OS</b>

       <b>ServerTokens</b> <b>Full</b>
            Specifies what information is included in the Server header of HTTP responses.  "None" disables  the
            Server  header.  "ProductOnly" reports "CUPS".  "Major" reports "CUPS/major IPP/2".  "Minor" reports
            "CUPS/major.minor IPP/2.1".   "Minimal"  reports  "CUPS/major.minor.patch  IPP/2.1".   "OS"  reports
            "CUPS/major.minor.path  (osname  osversion) IPP/2.1".  "Full" reports "CUPS/major.minor.path (osname
            osversion; architecture) IPP/2.1".  The default is "Minimal".

       <b>SSLListen</b> <u>ipv4-address</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>

       <b>SSLListen</b> <b>[</b><u>ipv6-address</u><b>]:</b><u>port</u>

       <b>SSLListen</b> <b>*:</b><u>port</u>
            Listens on the specified address and port for encrypted connections.

       <b>SSLOptions</b> [<u>AllowDH</u>] [<u>AllowRC4</u>] [<u>AllowSSL3</u>] [<u>DenyCBC</u>] [<u>DenyTLS1.0</u>] [<u>MaxTLS1.0</u>] [<u>MaxTLS1.1</u>] [<u>MaxTLS1.2</u>]
       [<u>MaxTLS1.3</u>] [<u>MinTLS1.0</u>] [<u>MinTLS1.1</u>] [<u>MinTLS1.2</u>] [<u>MinTLS1.3</u>] [<u>NoSystem</u>]

       <b>SSLOptions</b> <b>None</b>
            Sets encryption options (only in /etc/cups/client.conf).  By default, CUPS only supports  encryption
            using  TLS  v1.0 or higher using known secure cipher suites.  Security is reduced when <u>Allow</u> options
            are used.  Security is enhanced when <u>Deny</u> options are  used.   The  <u>AllowDH</u>  option  enables  cipher
            suites  using  plain  Diffie-Hellman  key negotiation (not supported on systems using GNU TLS).  The
            <u>AllowRC4</u> option enables the 128-bit RC4 cipher suites, which are required for  some  older  clients.
            The  <u>AllowSSL3</u> option enables SSL v3.0, which is required for some older clients that do not support
            TLS v1.0.  The <u>DenyCBC</u> option disables all CBC cipher suites.  The <u>DenyTLS1.0</u>  option  disables  TLS
            v1.0  support  -  this  sets  the  minimum protocol version to TLS v1.1.  The <u>MinTLS</u> options set the
            minimum TLS version to support.  The <u>MaxTLS</u> options set the maximum TLS  version  to  support.   The
            <u>NoSystem</u>  option  disables  applying system cryptographic policy.  Not all operating systems support
            TLS 1.3 at this time.

       <b>SSLPort</b> <u>port</u>
            Listens on the specified port for encrypted connections.

       <b>StrictConformance</b> <b>Yes</b>

       <b>StrictConformance</b> <b>No</b>
            Specifies whether the scheduler requires clients to strictly adhere to the IPP specifications.   The
            default is "No".

       <b>Timeout</b> <u>seconds</u>
            Specifies the HTTP request timeout.  The default is "900" (15 minutes).

       <b>WebInterface</b> <b>yes</b>

       <b>WebInterface</b> <b>no</b>
            Specifies whether the web interface is enabled.  The default is "No".

   <b>HTTP</b> <b>METHOD</b> <b>NAMES</b>
       The following HTTP methods are supported by <b><a href="../man8/cupsd.8.html">cupsd</a></b>(8):

       GET  Used by a client to download icons and other printer resources and to access the CUPS web interface.

       <b>Allow</b> <b>@LOCAL</b>
            Allows  access from the named hosts, domains, addresses, or interfaces.  The @IF(name) form uses the
            current subnets configured for the named interface.   The  @LOCAL  form  uses  the  current  subnets
            configured for all interfaces that are not point-to-point, for example Ethernet and Wi-Fi interfaces
            are  used  but DSL and VPN interfaces are not.  The Order directive controls whether Allow lines are
            evaluated before or after Deny lines.

       <b>AuthType</b> <b>None</b>

       <b>AuthType</b> <b>Basic</b>

       <b>AuthType</b> <b>Default</b>
            Specifies  the  type  of  authentication  required.   The  value  "Default"   corresponds   to   the
            DefaultAuthType value.

       <b>Deny</b> <b>@IF(</b><u>name</u><b>)</b>

       <b>Deny</b> <b>@LOCAL</b>
            Denies  access from the named hosts, domains, addresses, or interfaces.  The @IF(name) form uses the
            current subnets configured for the named interface.   The  @LOCAL  form  uses  the  current  subnets
            configured for all interfaces that are not point-to-point, for example Ethernet and Wi-Fi interfaces
            are  used  but  DSL and VPN interfaces are not.  The Order directive controls whether Deny lines are
            evaluated before or after Allow lines.

       <b>Encryption</b> <b>IfRequested</b>

       <b>Encryption</b> <b>Never</b>

       <b>Encryption</b> <b>Required</b>
            Specifies the level of encryption that is required for a particular location.  The default value  is
            "IfRequested".

       <b>Order</b> <b>allow,deny</b>
            Specifies that access is denied by default. Allow lines are then processed followed by Deny lines to
            determine whether a client may access a particular resource.

       <b>Order</b> <b>deny,allow</b>
            Specifies  that  access is allowed by default. Deny lines are then processed followed by Allow lines
            to determine whether a client may access a particular resource.

       <b>Require</b> <b>group</b> <u>group-name</u> [ <u>group-name</u> ... ]
            Specifies that an authenticated user must be a member of one of the named groups.

       <b>Require</b> <b>user</b> <b>{</b><u>user-name</u>|<b>@</b><u>group-name</u>} ...
            Specifies that an authenticated user must match one of the named users or be a member of one of  the
            named groups.  The group name "@SYSTEM" corresponds to the list of groups defined by the SystemGroup
            directive  in  the <b><a href="../man5/cups-files.conf.5.html">cups-files.conf</a></b>(5) file.  The group name "@OWNER" corresponds to the owner of the
            resource, for example the person that submitted a print job.  Note: The 'root' user is  not  special
            and must be granted privileges like any other user account.

       <b>Require</b> <b>valid-user</b>
            Specifies that any authenticated user is acceptable.

       <b>Satisfy</b> <b>all</b>
            Specifies  that  all Allow, AuthType, Deny, Order, and Require conditions must be satisfied to allow
            access.

       <b>Satisfy</b> <b>any</b>
            Specifies that any a client may access a resource if either the authentication (AuthType/Require) or
            address (Allow/Deny/Order) conditions are satisfied.  For example,  this  can  be  used  to  require
            authentication only for remote accesses.

   <b>DIRECTIVES</b> <b>VALID</b> <b>WITHIN</b> <b>POLICY</b> <b>SECTIONS</b>
       The following directives may be placed inside Policy sections in the <b>cupsd.conf</b> file:

       <b>JobPrivateAccess</b> <b>all</b>

       <b>JobPrivateAccess</b> <b>default</b>

       <b>JobPrivateAccess</b> {<u>user</u>|<b>@</b><u>group</u>|<b>@ACL</b>|<b>@OWNER</b>|<b>@SYSTEM</b>} ...
            Specifies an access list for a job's private values.  The "default" access list is "@OWNER @SYSTEM".
            "@ACL"  maps  to  the  printer's requesting-user-name-allowed or requesting-user-name-denied values.
            "@OWNER" maps to the job's owner.  "@SYSTEM" maps to the groups listed for the SystemGroup directive
            in the <b><a href="../man5/cups-files.conf.5.html">cups-files.conf</a></b>(5) file.

       <b>JobPrivateValues</b> <b>all</b>

       <b>JobPrivateValues</b> <b>default</b>

       <b>JobPrivateValues</b> <b>none</b>

       <b>JobPrivateValues</b> <u>attribute-name</u> [ ... <u>attribute-name</u> ]
            Specifies the list of job values to make  private.   The  "default"  values  are  "job-name",  "job-
            originating-host-name", "job-originating-user-name", and "phone".

       <b>SubscriptionPrivateAccess</b> <b>all</b>

       <b>SubscriptionPrivateAccess</b> <b>default</b>

       <b>SubscriptionPrivateAccess</b> {<u>user</u>|<b>@</b><u>group</u>|<b>@ACL</b>|<b>@OWNER</b>|<b>@SYSTEM</b>} ...
            Specifies  an access list for a subscription's private values.  The "default" access list is "@OWNER
            @SYSTEM".  "@ACL" maps to the printer's requesting-user-name-allowed or  requesting-user-name-denied
            values.   "@OWNER" maps to the job's owner.  "@SYSTEM" maps to the groups listed for the SystemGroup
            directive in the <b><a href="../man5/cups-files.conf.5.html">cups-files.conf</a></b>(5) file.

       <b>SubscriptionPrivateValues</b> <b>all</b>

       <b>SubscriptionPrivateValues</b> <b>default</b>

       <b>SubscriptionPrivateValues</b> <b>none</b>

       <b>SubscriptionPrivateValues</b> <u>attribute-name</u> [ ... <u>attribute-name</u> ]
            Specifies the list of subscription values to  make  private.   The  "default"  values  are  "notify-
            events",  "notify-pull-method",  "notify-recipient-uri", "notify-subscriber-user-name", and "notify-
            user-data".

   <b>DEPRECATED</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b>
       The following directives are deprecated and will be removed in a future release of CUPS:

       <b>AuthType</b> <b>Negotiate</b>
            Specifies Kerberos authentication is required.

       <b>Classification</b> <u>banner</u>
            Specifies the security classification of the server.  Any valid banner name can be  used,  including
            "classified",  "confidential",  "secret",  "topsecret",  and  "unclassified",  or  the banner can be
            omitted to disable secure printing functions.  The default is no classification banner.

       <b>ClassifyOverride</b> <b>Yes</b>

       <b>ClassifyOverride</b> <b>No</b>
            Specifies whether users may override the classification (cover page) of individual print jobs  using
            the "job-sheets" option.  The default is "No".

       <b>DefaultAuthType</b> <b>Negotiate</b>
            Specifies that Kerberos authentication is required by default.

       <b>GSSServiceName</b> <u>name</u>
            Specifies the service name when using Kerberos authentication.  The default service name is "http."

       <b>PageLogFormat</b> <u>format-string</u>
            Specifies the format of PageLog lines.  Sequences beginning with percent (%) characters are replaced
            with  the corresponding information, while all other characters are copied literally.  The following
            percent sequences are recognized:

                "%%" inserts a single percent character.
                "%{name}" inserts the value of the specified IPP attribute.
                "%C" inserts the number of copies for the current page.
                "%P" inserts the current page number.
                "%T" inserts the current date and time in common log format.
                "%j" inserts the job ID.
                "%p" inserts the printer name.
                "%u" inserts the username.

            The default is the empty string, which disables page logging.  The string "%p %u %j %T %P %C  %{job-
            billing}  %{job-originating-host-name}  %{job-name}  %{media}  %{sides}" creates a page log with the
            standard items.  Use "%{job-impressions-completed}" to insert the number of pages (sides) that  were
            printed, or "%{job-media-sheets-completed}" to insert the number of sheets that were printed.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       File, directory, and user configuration directives that used to be allowed in the <b>cupsd.conf</b> file are now
       stored  in  the <b><a href="../man5/cups-files.conf.5.html">cups-files.conf</a></b>(5) file instead in order to prevent certain types of privilege escalation
       attacks.

       The scheduler MUST be restarted manually after making changes to the <b>cupsd.conf</b> file.  On Linux  this  is
       typically done using the <b><a href="../man8/systemctl.8.html">systemctl</a></b>(8) command, while on macOS the <b><a href="../man8/launchctl.8.html">launchctl</a></b>(8) command is used instead.

       The @LOCAL macro name can be confusing since the system running <b>cupsd</b> often belongs to a different set of
       subnets from its clients.

</pre><h4><b>CONFORMING</b> <b>TO</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>cupsd.conf</b> file format is based on the Apache HTTP Server configuration file format.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Log everything with a maximum log file size of 32 megabytes:

           AccessLogLevel all
           LogLevel debug2
           MaxLogSize 32m

       Require authentication for accesses from outside the 10. network:

           &lt;Location /&gt;
           Order allow,deny
           Allow from 10./8
           AuthType Basic
           Require valid-user
           Satisfy any
           &lt;/Location&gt;
