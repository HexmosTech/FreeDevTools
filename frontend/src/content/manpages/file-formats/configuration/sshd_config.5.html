</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sshd_config — OpenSSH daemon configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)  reads configuration data from <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/sshd_config">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</a></u> (or the file specified with <b>-f</b> on the command
       line).  The file contains keyword-argument pairs,  one  per  line.   Unless  noted  otherwise,  for  each
       keyword,  the first obtained value will be used.  Lines starting with ‘#’ and empty lines are interpreted
       as comments.  Arguments may optionally be enclosed in double quotes (") in order to  represent  arguments
       containing spaces.

       Note  that  the  Debian  <b>openssh-server</b>  package sets several options as standard in <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/sshd_config">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</a></u>
       which are not the default in <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8):

             <b>•</b>   <b>Include</b> <b><a href="file:/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/">/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/</a>*.conf</b>
             <b>•</b>   <b>KbdInteractiveAuthentication</b> no
             <b>•</b>   <b>X11Forwarding</b> yes
             <b>•</b>   <b>PrintMotd</b> no
             <b>•</b>   <b>AcceptEnv</b> LANG LC_* COLORTERM NO_COLOR
             <b>•</b>   <b>Subsystem</b> sftp <a href="file:/usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server">/usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server</a>
             <b>•</b>   <b>UsePAM</b> yes

       <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/">/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/</a>*.conf</u> files are included at the start of the configuration file, so  options  set
       there will override those in <u>/etc/ssh/sshd_config.</u>

       The  possible  keywords  and  their  meanings are as follows (note that keywords are case-insensitive and
       arguments are case-sensitive):

       <b>AcceptEnv</b>
               Specifies what environment variables sent by  the  client  will  be  copied  into  the  session's
               <u><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></u>(7).   See  <b>SendEnv</b> and <b>SetEnv</b> in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5) for how to configure the client.  The TERM
               environment variable is always accepted whenever the client requests a pseudo-terminal as  it  is
               required  by  the  protocol.   Variables  are  specified  by name, which may contain the wildcard
               characters ‘*’ and ‘?’.  Multiple environment variables may be separated by whitespace or  spread
               across multiple <b>AcceptEnv</b> directives.  Be warned that some environment variables could be used to
               bypass  restricted  user  environments.  For this reason, care should be taken in the use of this
               directive.  The default is not to accept any environment variables.

       <b>AddressFamily</b>
               Specifies which address family should be used by <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8).  Valid arguments are <b>any</b> (the default),
               <b>inet</b> (use IPv4 only), or <b>inet6</b> (use IPv6 only).

       <b>AllowAgentForwarding</b>
               Specifies whether <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1) forwarding is permitted.  The default is <b>yes</b>.  Note that disabling
               agent forwarding does not improve security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can
               always install their own forwarders.

       <b>AllowGroups</b>
               This keyword can be followed by  a  list  of  group  name  patterns,  separated  by  spaces.   If
               specified,  login  is  allowed  only  for  users  whose primary group or supplementary group list
               matches one of the patterns.  Only group names are valid; a numerical group ID is not recognized.
               By default, login is allowed for all groups.  The allow/deny groups directives are  processed  in
               the following order: <b>DenyGroups</b>, <b>AllowGroups</b>.

               See PATTERNS in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5) for more information on patterns.  This keyword may appear multiple
               times in <b>sshd_config</b> with each instance appending to the list.

       <b>AllowStreamLocalForwarding</b>
               Specifies  whether  StreamLocal  (Unix-domain  socket)  forwarding  is  permitted.  The available
               options are <b>yes</b> (the default)  or  <b>all</b>  to  allow  StreamLocal  forwarding,  <b>no</b>  to  prevent  all
               StreamLocal  forwarding, <b>local</b> to allow local (from the perspective of <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)) forwarding only or
               <b>remote</b> to allow remote forwarding only.  Note that  disabling  StreamLocal  forwarding  does  not
               improve  security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can always install their own
               forwarders.

       <b>AllowTcpForwarding</b>
               Specifies whether TCP forwarding is permitted.  The available options are <b>yes</b>  (the  default)  or
               <b>all</b>  to  allow  TCP  forwarding, <b>no</b> to prevent all TCP forwarding, <b>local</b> to allow local (from the
               perspective of <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)) forwarding only or <b>remote</b> to allow  remote  forwarding  only.   Note  that
               disabling  TCP forwarding does not improve security unless users are also denied shell access, as
               they can always install their own forwarders.

       <b>AllowUsers</b>
               This keyword can be followed by a list of user name patterns, separated by spaces.  If specified,
               login is allowed only for user names that match one of the patterns.  Only user names are  valid;
               a  numerical  user  ID  is  not  recognized.  By default, login is allowed for all users.  If the
               pattern takes the form USER@HOST then USER and HOST are separately checked, restricting logins to
               particular users from particular hosts.  HOST criteria  may  additionally  contain  addresses  to
               match  in  CIDR  address/masklen  format.   The  allow/deny users directives are processed in the
               following order: <b>DenyUsers</b>, <b>AllowUsers</b>.

               See PATTERNS in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5) for more information on patterns.  This keyword may appear multiple
               times in <b>sshd_config</b> with each instance appending to the list.

       <b>AuthenticationMethods</b>
               Specifies the authentication methods that must be successfully completed for a user to be granted
               access.  This option must be followed by one or  more  lists  of  comma-separated  authentication
               method  names,  or  by  the  single string <b>any</b> to indicate the default behaviour of accepting any
               single authentication method.  If the  default  is  overridden,  then  successful  authentication
               requires completion of every method in at least one of these lists.

               For  example,  "publickey,password  publickey,keyboard-interactive"  would  require  the  user to
               complete  public  key  authentication,  followed  by  either  password  or  keyboard  interactive
               authentication.   Only  methods  that are next in one or more lists are offered at each stage, so
               for  this  example  it  would  not  be  possible  to  attempt  password  or  keyboard-interactive
               authentication before public key.

               For  keyboard  interactive  authentication  it  is  also possible to restrict authentication to a
               specific device by appending a colon followed by the device identifier <b>bsdauth</b> or <b>pam</b>.  depending
               on the server configuration.  For example, "keyboard-interactive:bsdauth" would restrict keyboard
               interactive authentication to the <b>bsdauth</b> device.

               If the publickey method is listed more than once, <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) verifies that keys that have been  used
               successfully  are  not reused for subsequent authentications.  For example, "publickey,publickey"
               requires successful authentication using two different public keys.

               Note  that  each  authentication  method  listed  should  also  be  explicitly  enabled  in   the
               configuration.

               The available authentication methods are: "gssapi-with-mic", "hostbased", "keyboard-interactive",
               "none"  (used  for  access  to  password-less  accounts  when  <b>PermitEmptyPasswords</b>  is enabled),
               "password" and "publickey".

       <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand</b>
               Specifies a program to be used to look up the user's public keys.  The program must be  owned  by
               root,  not  writable  by  group  or  others  and  specified  by  an  absolute path.  Arguments to
               <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand</b> accept the tokens described in the “TOKENS” section.  If no  arguments  are
               specified then the username of the target user is used.

               The  program  should produce on standard output zero or more lines of authorized_keys output (see
               <b>AUTHORIZED_KEYS</b> in <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)).  <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand</b> is tried after the  usual  <b>AuthorizedKeysFile</b>
               files   and   will  not  be  executed  if  a  matching  key  is  found  there.   By  default,  no
               <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand</b> is run.

       <b>AuthorizedKeysCommandUser</b>
               Specifies the user under whose account the <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand</b> is run.  It  is  recommended  to
               use  a  dedicated  user that has no other role on the host than running authorized keys commands.
               If <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand</b> is specified but <b>AuthorizedKeysCommandUser</b> is  not,  then  <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)  will
               refuse to start.

       <b>AuthorizedKeysFile</b>
               Specifies  the  file  that  contains the public keys used for user authentication.  The format is
               described in the AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT section of <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8).  Arguments to <b>AuthorizedKeysFile</b>
               may include wildcards and accept the tokens described in the “TOKENS” section.  After  expansion,
               <b>AuthorizedKeysFile</b>  is taken to be an absolute path or one relative to the user's home directory.
               Multiple files may be listed, separated by whitespace.  Alternately this option  may  be  set  to
               <b>none</b>   to   skip  checking  for  user  keys  in  files.   The  default  is  ".ssh/authorized_keys
               .ssh/authorized_keys2".

       <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</b>
               Specifies a program to be used to generate the list of  allowed  certificate  principals  as  per
               <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b>.  The program must be owned by root, not writable by group or others and
               specified  by  an  absolute  path.   Arguments  to  <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</b> accept the tokens
               described in the “TOKENS” section.  If no arguments are specified then the username of the target
               user is used.

               The program should produce on standard output zero  or  more  lines  of  <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b>
               output.   If  either  <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</b>  or <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b> is specified, then
               certificates offered by the client for authentication must contain a principal  that  is  listed.
               By default, no <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</b> is run.

       <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser</b>
               Specifies the user under whose account the <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</b> is run.  It is recommended
               to  use  a  dedicated  user that has no other role on the host than running authorized principals
               commands.  If <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</b> is  specified  but  <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser</b>  is
               not, then <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) will refuse to start.

       <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b>
               Specifies  a  file  that  lists principal names that are accepted for certificate authentication.
               When using certificates signed by a key listed in <b>TrustedUserCAKeys</b>, this file lists  names,  one
               of  which  must  appear  in  the certificate for it to be accepted for authentication.  Names are
               listed one per line preceded by key options (as  described  in  <b>AUTHORIZED_KEYS</b>  <b>FILE</b>  <b>FORMAT</b>  in
               <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)).  Empty lines and comments starting with ‘#’ are ignored.

               Arguments  to  <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b>  may include wildcards and accept the tokens described in
               the “TOKENS” section.  After expansion, <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b> is taken to be an absolute  path
               or  one relative to the user's home directory.  The default is <b>none</b>, i.e. not to use a principals
               file – in this case, the username of the user must appear in a certificate's principals list  for
               it to be accepted.

               Note that <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b> is only used when authentication proceeds using a CA listed in
               <b>TrustedUserCAKeys</b>   and   is   not   consulted   for   certification   authorities   trusted  via
               <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a></u>, though the <b>principals=</b> key option offers a similar facility (see  <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)
               for details).

       <b>Banner</b>  The  contents of the specified file are sent to the remote user before authentication is allowed.
               If the argument is <b>none</b> then no banner is displayed.  By default, no banner is displayed.

       <b>CASignatureAlgorithms</b>
               Specifies which algorithms are allowed for signing of  certificates  by  certificate  authorities
               (CAs).  The default is:

                     ssh-ed25519,ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,
                     ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
                     <a href="mailto:sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com">sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com</a>,
                     <a href="mailto:sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com">sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com</a>,
                     rsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256

               If the specified list begins with a ‘+’ character, then the specified algorithms will be appended
               to the default set instead of replacing them.  If the specified list begins with a ‘-’ character,
               then  the specified algorithms (including wildcards) will be removed from the default set instead
               of replacing them.

               Certificates signed using other algorithms will not be accepted  for  public  key  or  host-based
               authentication.

       <b>ChannelTimeout</b>
               Specifies whether and how quickly <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) should close inactive channels.  Timeouts are specified
               as  one  or  more  “type=interval”  pairs  separated  by whitespace, where the “type” must be the
               special keyword “global” or a channel type  name  from  the  list  below,  optionally  containing
               wildcard characters.

               The  timeout  value  “interval” is specified in seconds or may use any of the units documented in
               the “TIME FORMATS” section.  For  example,  “session=5m”  would  cause  interactive  sessions  to
               terminate  after  five  minutes  of  inactivity.  Specifying a zero value disables the inactivity
               timeout.

               The special timeout “global” applies to all active channels,  taken  together.   Traffic  on  any
               active  channel  will reset the timeout, but when the timeout expires then all open channels will
               be closed.  Note that this global timeout is not matched  by  wildcards  and  must  be  specified
               explicitly.

               The available channel type names include:

               <b>agent-connection</b>
                       Open connections to <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1).

               <b>direct-tcpip</b>, <b><a href="mailto:direct-streamlocal@openssh.com">direct-streamlocal@openssh.com</a></b>
                       Open  TCP  or  Unix  socket  (respectively) connections that have been established from a
                       <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) local forwarding, i.e. <b>LocalForward</b> or <b>DynamicForward</b>.

               <b>forwarded-tcpip</b>, <b><a href="mailto:forwarded-streamlocal@openssh.com">forwarded-streamlocal@openssh.com</a></b>
                       Open TCP or Unix socket (respectively)  connections  that  have  been  established  to  a
                       <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) listening on behalf of a <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) remote forwarding, i.e. <b>RemoteForward</b>.

               <b>session</b>
                       The  interactive  main  session,  including  shell  session,  command  execution, <u><a href="../man1/scp.1.html">scp</a></u>(1),
                       <u><a href="../man1/sftp.1.html">sftp</a></u>(1), etc.

               <b>tun-connection</b>
                       Open <b>TunnelForward</b> connections.

               <b>x11-connection</b>
                       Open X11 forwarding sessions.

               Note that in all the above cases, terminating an inactive session does not  guarantee  to  remove
               all  resources  associated  with the session, e.g. shell processes or X11 clients relating to the
               session may continue to execute.

               Moreover, terminating an  inactive  channel  or  session  does  not  necessarily  close  the  SSH
               connection,  nor  does  it prevent a client from requesting another channel of the same type.  In
               particular, expiring an inactive forwarding session does not prevent another identical forwarding
               from being subsequently created.

               The default is not to expire channels of any type for inactivity.

       <b>ChrootDirectory</b>
               Specifies the pathname of a directory to <u><a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</a></u>(2) to after authentication.  At  session  startup
               <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)  checks  that  all  components  of  the pathname are root-owned directories which are not
               writable by group or others.  After the chroot, <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) changes  the  working  directory  to  the
               user's  home directory.  Arguments to <b>ChrootDirectory</b> accept the tokens described in the “TOKENS”
               section.

               The <b>ChrootDirectory</b> must contain the necessary  files  and  directories  to  support  the  user's
               session.   For  an interactive session this requires at least a shell, typically <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1), and basic
               <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> nodes such as <u><a href="../man4/null.4.html">null</a></u>(4), <u><a href="../man4/zero.4.html">zero</a></u>(4), <u><a href="../man4/stdin.4.html">stdin</a></u>(4), <u><a href="../man4/stdout.4.html">stdout</a></u>(4), <u><a href="../man4/stderr.4.html">stderr</a></u>(4),  and  <u><a href="../man4/tty.4.html">tty</a></u>(4)  devices.   For
               file  transfer sessions using SFTP no additional configuration of the environment is necessary if
               the in-process sftp-server is used, though sessions which use logging may require <u>/dev/log</u> inside
               the chroot directory on some operating systems (see <u><a href="../man8/sftp-server.8.html">sftp-server</a></u>(8) for details).

               For safety, it is very important that the directory hierarchy be prevented from  modification  by
               other  processes on the system (especially those outside the jail).  Misconfiguration can lead to
               unsafe environments which <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) cannot detect.

               The default is <b>none</b>, indicating not to <u><a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</a></u>(2).

       <b>Ciphers</b>
               Specifies the ciphers allowed.  Multiple ciphers must be comma-separated.  If the specified  list
               begins  with  a  ‘+’  character,  then  the specified ciphers will be appended to the default set
               instead of replacing them.  If the specified list begins with a ‘-’ character, then the specified
               ciphers (including wildcards) will be removed from the default set instead of replacing them.  If
               the specified list begins with a ‘^’ character, then the specified ciphers will be placed at  the
               head of the default set.

               The supported ciphers are:

                     3des-cbc
                     aes128-cbc
                     aes192-cbc
                     aes256-cbc
                     aes128-ctr
                     aes192-ctr
                     aes256-ctr

                     aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr

               The list of available ciphers may also be obtained using "ssh -Q cipher".

       <b>ClientAliveCountMax</b>
               Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) receiving any messages
               back  from  the client.  If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent,
               sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session.  It is important to note that  the  use
               of client alive messages is very different from <b>TCPKeepAlive</b>.  The client alive messages are sent
               through  the  encrypted  channel  and  therefore will not be spoofable.  The TCP keepalive option
               enabled by <b>TCPKeepAlive</b> is spoofable.  The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client  or
               server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.

               The  default value is 3.  If <b>ClientAliveInterval</b> is set to 15, and <b>ClientAliveCountMax</b> is left at
               the default, unresponsive SSH clients  will  be  disconnected  after  approximately  45  seconds.
               Setting a zero <b>ClientAliveCountMax</b> disables connection termination.

       <b>ClientAliveInterval</b>
               Sets  a  timeout  interval  in  seconds after which if no data has been received from the client,
               <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the  client.
               The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.

       <b>Compression</b>
               Specifies  whether  compression  is  enabled  after the user has authenticated successfully.  The
               argument must be <b>yes</b>, <b>delayed</b> (a legacy synonym for <b>yes</b>) or <b>no</b>.  The default is <b>yes</b>.

       <b>DebianBanner</b>
               Specifies whether the distribution-specified extra version  suffix  is  included  during  initial
               protocol handshake.  The default is <b>yes</b>.

       <b>DenyGroups</b>
               This  keyword  can  be  followed by a list of group name patterns, separated by spaces.  Login is
               disallowed for users whose primary group or supplementary group list matches one of the patterns.
               Only group names are valid; a numerical group ID is not recognized.  By default, login is allowed
               for all groups.   The  allow/deny  groups  directives  are  processed  in  the  following  order:
               <b>DenyGroups</b>, <b>AllowGroups</b>.

               See PATTERNS in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5) for more information on patterns.  This keyword may appear multiple
               times in <b>sshd_config</b> with each instance appending to the list.

       <b>DenyUsers</b>
               This  keyword  can  be  followed  by a list of user name patterns, separated by spaces.  Login is
               disallowed for user names that match one of the patterns.  Only user names are valid; a numerical
               user ID is not recognized.  By default, login is allowed for all users.  If the pattern takes the
               form USER@HOST then USER and HOST are separately checked, restricting logins to particular  users
               from  particular  hosts.   HOST  criteria  may  additionally  contain  addresses to match in CIDR
               address/masklen format.  The allow/deny users directives are processed in  the  following  order:
               <b>DenyUsers</b>, <b>AllowUsers</b>.

               See PATTERNS in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5) for more information on patterns.  This keyword may appear multiple
               times in <b>sshd_config</b> with each instance appending to the list.

       <b>DisableForwarding</b>
               Disables  all forwarding features, including X11, <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1), TCP and StreamLocal.  This option
               overrides all other forwarding-related options and may simplify restricted configurations.

       <b>ExposeAuthInfo</b>
               Writes a temporary file containing a list of authentication methods and public credentials  (e.g.
               keys)  used  to  authenticate  the user.  The location of the file is exposed to the user session
               through the SSH_USER_AUTH environment variable.  The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>FingerprintHash</b>
               Specifies the hash algorithm used when logging key fingerprints.   Valid  options  are:  <b>md5</b>  and
               <b>sha256</b>.  The default is <b>sha256</b>.

       <b>ForceCommand</b>
               Forces  the  execution of the command specified by <b>ForceCommand</b>, ignoring any command supplied by
               the client and <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/rc">~/.ssh/rc</a></u> if present.  The command is invoked by using the user's login shell with
               the -c option.  This applies to shell, command, or subsystem execution.  It is most useful inside
               a  <b>Match</b>  block.   The  command  originally  supplied  by  the  client  is   available   in   the
               SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND  environment variable.  Specifying a command of <b>internal-sftp</b> will force the
               use of an in-process SFTP server that requires no support files when used  with  <b>ChrootDirectory</b>.
               The default is <b>none</b>.

       <b>GatewayPorts</b>
               Specifies  whether  remote  hosts  are  allowed to connect to ports forwarded for the client.  By
               default, <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) binds remote port forwardings to the  loopback  address.   This  prevents  other
               remote  hosts  from connecting to forwarded ports.  <b>GatewayPorts</b> can be used to specify that sshd
               should allow remote port forwardings to bind to non-loopback addresses, thus allowing other hosts
               to connect.  The argument may be <b>no</b> to force remote port forwardings to be available to the local
               host  only,  <b>yes</b>  to  force  remote  port  forwardings  to  bind  to  the  wildcard  address,  or
               <b>clientspecified</b>  to allow the client to select the address to which the forwarding is bound.  The
               default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>GSSAPIAuthentication</b>
               Specifies whether user authentication based on GSSAPI is allowed.  The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>GSSAPICleanupCredentials</b>
               Specifies whether to automatically destroy the user's credentials cache on logout.   The  default
               is <b>yes</b>.

       <b>GSSAPIKeyExchange</b>
               Specifies  whether  key  exchange based on GSSAPI is allowed. GSSAPI key exchange doesn't rely on
               ssh keys to verify host identity.  The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>GSSAPIStrictAcceptorCheck</b>
               Determines whether to be strict about the identity of the GSSAPI acceptor a client  authenticates
               against.  If set to <b>yes</b> then the client must authenticate against the host service on the current
               hostname.   If  set  to <b>no</b> then the client may authenticate against any service key stored in the
               machine's default store.  This facility is provided to  assist  with  operation  on  multi  homed
               machines.  The default is <b>yes</b>.

       <b>GSSAPIStoreCredentialsOnRekey</b>
               Controls  whether  the  user's  GSSAPI  credentials  should  be  updated  following  a successful
               connection rekeying. This option can be used to accepted renewed or updated  credentials  from  a
               compatible client. The default is “no”.

               For this to work <b>GSSAPIKeyExchange</b> needs to be enabled in the server and also used by the client.

       <b>GSSAPIKexAlgorithms</b>
               The list of key exchange algorithms that are accepted by GSSAPI key exchange. Possible values are

                  gss-gex-sha1-,
                  gss-group1-sha1-,
                  gss-group14-sha1-,
                  gss-group14-sha256-,
                  gss-group16-sha512-,
                  gss-nistp256-sha256-,

                  gss-curve25519-sha256-
               The                                           default                                          is
               “gss-group14-sha256-,gss-group16-sha512-,gss-nistp256-sha256-,gss-curve25519-sha256-,gss-gex-sha1-,gss-group14-sha1-”.
               This option only applies to connections using GSSAPI.

       <b>HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms</b>
               Specifies the signature algorithms that will be accepted for hostbased authentication as  a  list
               of comma-separated patterns.  Alternately if the specified list begins with a ‘+’ character, then
               the specified signature algorithms will be appended to the default set instead of replacing them.
               If  the  specified  list  begins  with  a  ‘-’ character, then the specified signature algorithms
               (including wildcards) will be removed from the default set instead of  replacing  them.   If  the
               specified  list  begins  with  a  ‘^’  character, then the specified signature algorithms will be
               placed at the head of the default set.  The default for this option is:

               HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms".  This was formerly named HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes.

       <b>HostbasedAuthentication</b>
               Specifies  whether  rhosts or /etc/hosts.equiv authentication together with successful public key
               client host authentication is allowed (host-based authentication).  The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly</b>
               Specifies whether or not the server will attempt to perform a reverse name lookup  when  matching
               the  name in the <u><a href="file:~/.shosts">~/.shosts</a></u>, <u><a href="file:~/.rhosts">~/.rhosts</a></u>, and <u>/etc/hosts.equiv</u> files during <b>HostbasedAuthentication</b>.
               A setting of <b>yes</b> means that <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) uses the name supplied by the client rather  than  attempting
               to resolve the name from the TCP connection itself.  The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>HostCertificate</b>
               Specifies a file containing a public host certificate.  The certificate's public key must match a
               private  host  key already specified by <b>HostKey</b>.  The default behaviour of <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) is not to load
               any certificates.

       <b>HostKey</b>
               Specifies  a  file  containing  a  private  host   key   used   by   SSH.    The   defaults   are
               <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key</a></u>, <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key</a></u>.

               Note  that  <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)  will  refuse  to  use  a  file  if it is group/world-accessible and that the
               <b>HostKeyAlgorithms</b> option restricts which of the keys are actually used by <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8).

               It is possible to have multiple host key files.  It is also possible to specify public  host  key
               files instead.  In this case operations on the private key will be delegated to an <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1).

       <b>HostKeyAgent</b>
               Identifies  the  UNIX-domain  socket  used  to  communicate  with an agent that has access to the
               private host keys.  If the string "SSH_AUTH_SOCK" is specified, the location of the  socket  will
               be read from the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable.

       <b>HostKeyAlgorithms</b>
               Specifies  the host key signature algorithms that the server offers.  The default for this option
               is:

               The list of available signature algorithms may also be obtained using "ssh -Q HostKeyAlgorithms".

       <b>IgnoreRhosts</b>
               Specifies whether to ignore per-user <u>.rhosts</u> and <u>.shosts</u>  files  during  <b>HostbasedAuthentication</b>.
               The  system-wide  <u>/etc/hosts.equiv</u>  and  <u>/etc/ssh/shosts.equiv</u>  are still used regardless of this
               setting.

               Accepted values are <b>yes</b> (the default) to ignore all per-user files, <b>shosts-only</b> to allow the  use
               of <u>.shosts</u> but to ignore <u>.rhosts</u> or <b>no</b> to allow both <u>.shosts</u> and <u>rhosts</u>.

       <b>IgnoreUserKnownHosts</b>
               Specifies    whether    <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)    should    ignore    the   user's   <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a></u>   during
               <b>HostbasedAuthentication</b> and use only the system-wide known hosts  file  <u>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</u>.
               The default is “no”.

       <b>Include</b>
               Include  the  specified  configuration  file(s).   Multiple  pathnames  may be specified and each
               pathname may contain <u><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></u>(7) wildcards that will be expanded  and  processed  in  lexical  order.
               Files  without  absolute  paths  are  assumed to be in <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh">/etc/ssh</a></u>.  An <b>Include</b> directive may appear
               inside a <b>Match</b> block to perform conditional inclusion.

       <b>IPQoS</b>   Specifies the IPv4 type-of-service or DSCP class for the connection.  Accepted values  are  <b>af11</b>,
               <b>af12</b>,  <b>af13</b>,  <b>af21</b>, <b>af22</b>, <b>af23</b>, <b>af31</b>, <b>af32</b>, <b>af33</b>, <b>af41</b>, <b>af42</b>, <b>af43</b>, <b>cs0</b>, <b>cs1</b>, <b>cs2</b>, <b>cs3</b>, <b>cs4</b>, <b>cs5</b>,
               <b>cs6</b>, <b>cs7</b>, <b>ef</b>, <b>le</b>, <b>lowdelay</b>, <b>throughput</b>,  <b>reliability</b>,  a  numeric  value,  or  <b>none</b>  to  use  the
               operating  system  default.   This option may take one or two arguments, separated by whitespace.
               If one argument is specified, it is used as the packet class unconditionally.  If two values  are
               specified,  the  first is automatically selected for interactive sessions and the second for non-
               interactive sessions.  The default is <b>lowdelay</b> for interactive sessions and <b>throughput</b>  for  non-
               interactive sessions.

       <b>KbdInteractiveAuthentication</b>
               Specifies  whether  to  allow  keyboard-interactive  authentication.   The  default  is <b>yes</b>.  The
               argument to this keyword must be <b>yes</b> or  <b>no</b>.   <b>ChallengeResponseAuthentication</b>  is  a  deprecated
               alias for this.

       <b>KerberosAuthentication</b>
               Specifies  whether the password provided by the user for <b>PasswordAuthentication</b> will be validated
               through the Kerberos KDC.  To use this option, the server needs a Kerberos servtab  which  allows
               the verification of the KDC's identity.  The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>KerberosGetAFSToken</b>
               If  AFS  is  active  and  the  user  has a Kerberos 5 TGT, attempt to acquire an AFS token before
               accessing the user's home directory.  The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>KerberosOrLocalPasswd</b>
               If password authentication through Kerberos fails then the password will  be  validated  via  any
               additional local mechanism such as <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u>.  The default is <b>yes</b>.

       <b>KerberosTicketCleanup</b>
               Specifies  whether  to automatically destroy the user's ticket cache file on logout.  The default
               is <b>yes</b>.

       <b>KexAlgorithms</b>
               Specifies the permitted KEX (Key Exchange) algorithms that the server will offer to clients.  The
               ordering of this list is not important, as the client specifies the preference  order.   Multiple
               algorithms must be comma-separated.

               If the specified list begins with a ‘+’ character, then the specified algorithms will be appended
               to the default set instead of replacing them.  If the specified list begins with a ‘-’ character,
               then  the specified algorithms (including wildcards) will be removed from the default set instead
               of replacing them.  If the specified list  begins  with  a  ‘^’  character,  then  the  specified
               algorithms will be placed at the head of the default set.

               The supported algorithms are:

       <b>ListenAddress</b>
               Specifies the local addresses <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) should listen on.  The following forms may be used:

                     <b>ListenAddress</b> <u>hostname</u>|<u>address</u> [<b>rdomain</b> <u>domain</u>]
                     <b>ListenAddress</b> <u>hostname</u>:<u>port</u> [<b>rdomain</b> <u>domain</u>]
                     <b>ListenAddress</b> <u>IPv4_address</u>:<u>port</u> [<b>rdomain</b> <u>domain</u>]
                     <b>ListenAddress</b> [<u>hostname</u>|<u>address</u>]:<u>port</u> [<b>rdomain</b> <u>domain</u>]

               The optional <b>rdomain</b> qualifier requests <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) listen in an explicit routing domain.  If <u>port</u> is
               not specified, sshd will listen on the address and all <b>Port</b> options specified.  The default is to
               listen  on  all  local  addresses  on the current default routing domain.  Multiple <b>ListenAddress</b>
               options are permitted.

               On Linux, routing domains are implemented using Virtual Routing and  Forwarding  domains  (VRFs);
               for more information, see <u><a href="../man8/ip-vrf.8.html">ip-vrf</a></u>(8).

       <b>LoginGraceTime</b>
               The  server disconnects after this time if the user has not successfully logged in.  If the value
               is 0, there is no time limit.  The default is 120 seconds.

       <b>LogLevel</b>
               Gives the verbosity level that is used when logging messages from <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8).  The  possible  values
               are: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.  The default is INFO.
               DEBUG  and  DEBUG1  are  equivalent.   DEBUG2  and DEBUG3 each specify higher levels of debugging
               output.  Logging with a DEBUG level violates the privacy of users and is not recommended.

       <b>LogVerbose</b>
               Specify one or more overrides to <b>LogLevel</b>.  An override consists of one  or  more  pattern  lists
               that  matches  the  source  file,  function  and  line number to force detailed logging for.  For
               example, an override pattern of:

                     kex.c:*:1000,*:kex_exchange_identification():*,packet.c:*

               would   enable   detailed   logging   for   line   1000   of    <u>kex.c</u>,    everything    in    the
               <b>kex_exchange_identification</b>()  function,  and  all  code  in  the  <u>packet.c</u> file.  This option is
               intended for debugging and no overrides are enabled by default.

       <b>MACs</b>    Specifies the available MAC (message authentication code) algorithms.  The MAC algorithm is  used
               for  data  integrity  protection.  Multiple algorithms must be comma-separated.  If the specified
               list begins with a ‘+’ character, then the specified algorithms will be appended to  the  default
               set  instead  of  replacing  them.   If  the specified list begins with a ‘-’ character, then the
               specified algorithms (including wildcards) will be  removed  from  the  default  set  instead  of
               replacing them.  If the specified list begins with a ‘^’ character, then the specified algorithms
               will be placed at the head of the default set.

               The  algorithms that contain "-etm" calculate the MAC after encryption (encrypt-then-mac).  These
               are considered safer and their use recommended.  The supported MACs are:

                     hmac-md5
                     hmac-md5-96
                     hmac-sha1

               The list of available MAC algorithms may also be obtained using "ssh -Q mac".

       <b>Match</b>   Introduces a conditional block.  If all of the criteria on the  <b>Match</b>  line  are  satisfied,  the
               keywords  on  the  following  lines  override those set in the global section of the config file,
               until either another <b>Match</b> line or the end of the file.  If a keyword appears in  multiple  <b>Match</b>
               blocks that are satisfied, only the first instance of the keyword is applied.

               The  arguments  to  <b>Match</b>  are  one  or  more  criteria-pattern  pairs or one of the single token
               criteria: <b>All</b>, which matches all criteria, or <b>Invalid-User</b>,  which  matches  when  the  requested
               user-name  does  not  match  any  known  account.   The available criteria are <b>User</b>, <b>Group</b>, <b>Host</b>,
               <b>LocalAddress</b>, <b>LocalPort</b>, <b>Version</b>, <b>RDomain</b>, and <b>Address</b> (with  <b>RDomain</b>  representing  the  routing
               domain on which the connection was received; see <u><a href="../man8/ip-vrf.8.html">ip-vrf</a></u>(8)).

               The  match  patterns  may  consist  of  single  entries  or comma-separated lists and may use the
               wildcard and negation operators described in the “PATTERNS” section of <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5).

               The patterns in an  <b>Address</b>  criteria  may  additionally  contain  addresses  to  match  in  CIDR
               address/masklen  format,  such  as  192.0.2.0/24  or  2001:db8::/32.   Note  that the mask length
               provided must be consistent with the address - it is an error to specify a mask  length  that  is
               too  long for the address or one with bits set in this host portion of the address.  For example,
               192.0.2.0/33 and 192.0.2.0/8, respectively.

               The <b>Version</b> keyword matches against the version string of <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8), for example “OpenSSH_10.0”.

               Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines following a <b>Match</b> keyword.  Available keywords
               are <b>AcceptEnv</b>, <b>AllowAgentForwarding</b>, <b>AllowGroups</b>, <b>AllowStreamLocalForwarding</b>, <b>AllowTcpForwarding</b>,
               <b>AllowUsers</b>,     <b>AuthenticationMethods</b>,     <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand</b>,      <b>AuthorizedKeysCommandUser</b>,

               <b>PubkeyAuthentication</b>,   <b>PubkeyAuthOptions</b>,  <b>RefuseConnection</b>,  <b>RekeyLimit</b>,  <b>RevokedKeys</b>,  <b>SetEnv</b>,
               <b>StreamLocalBindMask</b>,    <b>StreamLocalBindUnlink</b>,    <b>TrustedUserCAKeys</b>,     <b>UnusedConnectionTimeout</b>,
               <b>X11DisplayOffset</b>, <b>X11Forwarding</b> and <b>X11UseLocalhost</b>.

       <b>MaxAuthTries</b>
               Specifies  the  maximum  number  of  authentication  attempts permitted per connection.  Once the
               number of failures reaches half this value, additional failures are logged.  The default is 6.

       <b>MaxSessions</b>
               Specifies the maximum number of open shell, login or subsystem (e.g. sftp) sessions permitted per
               network connection.  Multiple sessions may be established  by  clients  that  support  connection
               multiplexing.   Setting  <b>MaxSessions</b>  to 1 will effectively disable session multiplexing, whereas
               setting it to 0 will prevent all shell, login  and  subsystem  sessions  while  still  permitting
               forwarding.  The default is 10.

       <b>MaxStartups</b>
               Specifies  the  maximum  number  of  concurrent  unauthenticated  connections  to the SSH daemon.
               Additional connections will be  dropped  until  authentication  succeeds  or  the  <b>LoginGraceTime</b>
               expires for a connection.  The default is 10:30:100.

               Alternatively,  random  early  drop can be enabled by specifying the three colon separated values
               start:rate:full (e.g. "10:30:60").  <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) will refuse connection attempts with a probability of
               rate/100 (30%) if there are currently start (10) unauthenticated  connections.   The  probability
               increases  linearly  and  all  connection  attempts  are refused if the number of unauthenticated
               connections reaches full (60).

       <b>ModuliFile</b>
               Specifies  the  <u><a href="../man5/moduli.5.html">moduli</a></u>(5)  file  that  contains  the   Diffie-Hellman   groups   used   for   the
               “diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1”   and  “diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256”  key  exchange
               methods.  The default is <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/moduli">/etc/ssh/moduli</a></u>.

       <b>PAMServiceName</b>
               Specifies the service name  used  for  Pluggable  Authentication  Modules  (PAM)  authentication,
               authorisation and session controls when <b>UsePAM</b> is enabled.  The default is <b>sshd</b>.

       <b>PasswordAuthentication</b>
               Specifies whether password authentication is allowed.  The default is <b>yes</b>.

       <b>PermitEmptyPasswords</b>
               When password authentication is allowed, it specifies whether the server allows login to accounts
               with empty password strings.  The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>PermitListen</b>
               Specifies  the  addresses/ports  on  which  a  remote TCP port forwarding may listen.  The listen
               specification must be one of the following forms:

                     <b>PermitListen</b> <u>port</u>
                     <b>PermitListen</b> <u>host</u>:<u>port</u>

               Multiple permissions may be specified by separating them with whitespace.  An argument of <b>any</b> can
               be used to remove all restrictions and permit any listen requests.  An argument of  <b>none</b>  can  be
               used  to  prohibit  all listen requests.  The host name may contain wildcards as described in the
               PATTERNS section in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5).  The wildcard ‘*’ can also be used in place of a  port  number
               to allow all ports.  By default all port forwarding listen requests are permitted.  Note that the
               <b>GatewayPorts</b>  option  may  further  restrict  which addresses may be listened on.  Note also that
               <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) will request a listen host of “localhost” if no listen host  was  specifically  requested,
               and this name is treated differently to explicit localhost addresses of “127.0.0.1” and “::1”.

       <b>PermitOpen</b>
               Specifies   the  destinations  to  which  TCP  port  forwarding  is  permitted.   The  forwarding
               specification must be one of the following forms:

                     <b>PermitOpen</b> <u>host</u>:<u>port</u>
                     <b>PermitOpen</b> <u>IPv4_addr</u>:<u>port</u>
                     <b>PermitOpen</b> <u>[IPv6_addr]</u>:<u>port</u>

               Multiple forwards may be specified by separating them with whitespace.  An argument of <b>any</b> can be
               used to remove all restrictions and permit any forwarding requests.  An argument of <b>none</b>  can  be
               used to prohibit all forwarding requests.  The wildcard ‘*’ can be used for host or port to allow
               all hosts or ports respectively.  Otherwise, no pattern matching or address lookups are performed
               on supplied names.  By default all port forwarding requests are permitted.

       <b>PermitRootLogin</b>
               Specifies  whether  root  can  log in using <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).  The argument must be <b>yes</b>, <b>prohibit-password</b>,
               <b>forced-commands-only</b>, or <b>no</b>.  The default is <b>prohibit-password</b>.

               If this option is set to <b>prohibit-password</b> (or its deprecated alias, <b>without-password</b>),  password
               and keyboard-interactive authentication are disabled for root.

               If  this option is set to <b>forced-commands-only</b>, root login with public key authentication will be
               allowed, but only if the <u>command</u> option has been specified (which may be useful for taking remote
               backups even if root login is normally  not  allowed).   All  other  authentication  methods  are
               disabled for root.

               If this option is set to <b>no</b>, root is not allowed to log in.

       <b>PermitTTY</b>
               Specifies whether <u><a href="../man4/pty.4.html">pty</a></u>(4) allocation is permitted.  The default is <b>yes</b>.

       <b>PermitTunnel</b>
               Specifies  whether <u><a href="../man4/tun.4.html">tun</a></u>(4) device forwarding is allowed.  The argument must be <b>yes</b>, <b>point-to-point</b>
               (layer 3), <b>ethernet</b> (layer 2), or <b>no</b>.  Specifying <b>yes</b> permits both <b>point-to-point</b>  and  <b>ethernet</b>.
               The default is <b>no</b>.

               Independent  of  this setting, the permissions of the selected <u><a href="../man4/tun.4.html">tun</a></u>(4) device must allow access to
               the user.

       <b>PermitUserEnvironment</b>
               Specifies whether <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/environment">~/.ssh/environment</a></u>  and  <b>environment=</b>  options  in  <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a></u>  are
               processed  by  <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8).  Valid options are <b>yes</b>, <b>no</b> or a pattern-list specifying which environment
               variable names to accept (for example "LANG,LC_*").  The default  is  <b>no</b>.   Enabling  environment
               processing may enable users to bypass access restrictions in some configurations using mechanisms
               such as LD_PRELOAD.

       <b>PermitUserRC</b>
               Specifies whether any <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/rc">~/.ssh/rc</a></u> file is executed.  The default is <b>yes</b>.

       <b>PerSourceMaxStartups</b>
               Specifies  the  number  of  unauthenticated  connections  allowed from a given source address, or
               “none” if there is no limit.  This limit is applied in  addition  to  <b>MaxStartups</b>,  whichever  is
               lower.  The default is <b>none</b>.

       <b>PerSourceNetBlockSize</b>
               Specifies  the  number  of  bits  of source address that are grouped together for the purposes of
               applying PerSourceMaxStartups limits.  Values for IPv4 and  optionally  IPv6  may  be  specified,
               separated  by  a  colon.   The  default  is  <b>32:128</b>,  which  means  each  address  is  considered
               individually.

       <b>PerSourcePenalties</b>
               Controls penalties for various conditions that may represent attacks on <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8).  If a penalty is
               enforced against a client then its source address and any others in the same network, as  defined
               by <b>PerSourceNetBlockSize</b>, will be refused connection for a period.

               A penalty doesn't affect concurrent connections in progress, but multiple penalties from the same
               source  from  concurrent  connections will accumulate up to a maximum.  Conversely, penalties are
               not applied until a minimum threshold time has been accumulated.

               Penalties are enabled by default with the default settings listed below but  may  disabled  using
               the  <b>no</b> keyword.  The defaults may be overridden by specifying one or more of the keywords below,
               separated by whitespace.  All keywords accept arguments, e.g. "crash:2m".

               <b>crash:duration</b>
                       Specifies how long to refuse clients that cause a crash of <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) (default: 90s).

               <b>authfail:duration</b>
                       Specifies  how  long  to  refuse  clients  that  disconnect  after  making  one  or  more
                       unsuccessful authentication attempts (default: 5s).

               <b>refuseconnection:duration</b>
                       Specifies how long to refuse clients that were administratively prohibited connection via
                       the <b>RefuseConnection</b> option (default: 10s).

               <b>noauth:duration</b>
                       Specifies  how  long  to refuse clients that disconnect without attempting authentication
                       (default: 1s).  This  timeout  should  be  used  cautiously  otherwise  it  may  penalise
                       legitimate scanning tools such as <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keyscan.1.html">ssh-keyscan</a></u>(1).

               <b>grace-exceeded:duration</b>
                       Specifies  how  long  to  refuse  clients  that fail to authenticate after <b>LoginGraceTime</b>
                       (default: 10s).

               <b>max:duration</b>
                       Specifies the maximum time a particular source address range will be refused  access  for
                       (default: 10m).  Repeated penalties will accumulate up to this maximum.

               <b>min:duration</b>
                       Specifies the minimum penalty that must accrue before enforcement begins (default: 15s).

               <b>max-sources4:number</b>, <b>max-sources6:number</b>
                       Specifies  the  maximum  number  of  client  IPv4  and  IPv6  address ranges to track for
                       penalties (default: 65536 for both).

               <b>overflow:mode</b>
                       Controls how the server behaves when <b>max-sources4</b> or <b>max-sources6</b> is exceeded.  There are
                       two operating modes: <b>deny-all</b>, which denies all incoming  connections  other  than  those
                       exempted  via  <b>PerSourcePenaltyExemptList</b>  until a penalty expires, and <b>permissive</b>, which
                       allows new connections by removing existing penalties early (default: permissive).   Note
                       that  client  penalties below the <b>min</b> threshold count against the total number of tracked
                       penalties.  IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are tracked separately, so an overflow  in  one  will
                       not affect the other.

               <b>overflow6:mode</b>
                       Allows  specifying  a  different overflow mode for IPv6 addresses.  The default it to use
                       the same overflow mode as was specified for IPv4.

       <b>PerSourcePenaltyExemptList</b>
               Specifies a comma-separated list of addresses to exempt from penalties.  This  list  may  contain
               wildcards and CIDR address/masklen ranges.  Note that the mask length provided must be consistent
               with  the  address  - it is an error to specify a mask length that is too long for the address or
               one with bits  set  in  this  host  portion  of  the  address.   For  example,  192.0.2.0/33  and
               192.0.2.0/8, respectively.  The default is not to exempt any addresses.

       <b>PidFile</b>
               Specifies the file that contains the process ID of the SSH daemon, or <b>none</b> to not write one.  The
               default is <u>/run/sshd.pid</u>.

       <b>Port</b>    Specifies  the port number that <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) listens on.  The default is 22.  Multiple options of this
               type are permitted.  See also <b>ListenAddress</b>.

       <b>PrintLastLog</b>
               Specifies whether <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) should print the date and time of the last user login when a user  logs
               in interactively.  The default is <b>yes</b>.

       <b>PrintMotd</b>
               Specifies  whether  <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)  should  print <u>/etc/motd</u> when a user logs in interactively.  (On some
               systems it is also printed by the shell, <u><a href="file:/etc/profile">/etc/profile</a></u>, or equivalent.)  The default is <b>yes</b>.

       <b>PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms</b>
               Specifies the signature algorithms that will be accepted for public key authentication as a  list
               of comma-separated patterns.  Alternately if the specified list begins with a ‘+’ character, then
               the  specified  algorithms will be appended to the default set instead of replacing them.  If the
               specified list begins with a ‘-’ character, then the specified algorithms  (including  wildcards)
               will  be  removed  from  the default set instead of replacing them.  If the specified list begins
               with a ‘^’ character, then the specified algorithms will be placed at the  head  of  the  default
               set.  The default for this option is:

               The   list   of   available   signature   algorithms   may   also   be  obtained  using  "ssh  -Q
               PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms".

       <b>PubkeyAuthOptions</b>
               Sets one or more public key authentication  options.   The  supported  keywords  are:  <b>none</b>  (the
               default; indicating no additional options are enabled), <b>touch-required</b> and <b>verify-required</b>.

               The  <b>touch-required</b>  option causes public key authentication using a FIDO authenticator algorithm
               (i.e. <b>ecdsa-sk</b> or <b>ed25519-sk</b>) to always require the signature to attest that a physically present
               user explicitly confirmed  the  authentication  (usually  by  touching  the  authenticator).   By
               default,  <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)  requires  user presence unless overridden with an authorized_keys option.  The
               <b>touch-required</b> flag disables this override.

               The <b>verify-required</b> option requires a FIDO key signature attest that the user was verified,  e.g.
               via a PIN.

               Neither the <b>touch-required</b> or <b>verify-required</b> options have any effect for other, non-FIDO, public
               key types.

       <b>PubkeyAuthentication</b>
               Specifies whether public key authentication is allowed.  The default is <b>yes</b>.

       <b>RefuseConnection</b>
               Indicates  that  <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)  should  unconditionally  terminate  the  connection.   Additionally,  a
               <b>refuseconnection</b>  penalty  may  be  recorded  against   the   source   of   the   connection   if
               <b>PerSourcePenalties</b> are enabled.  This option is only really useful in a <b>Match</b> block.

       <b>RekeyLimit</b>
               Specifies  the  maximum amount of data that may be transmitted or received before the session key
               is renegotiated, optionally followed by a maximum amount of time that may pass before the session
               key is renegotiated.  The first argument is specified in bytes and may have a suffix of ‘K’, ‘M’,
               or ‘G’ to indicate Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively.  The default is between ‘1G’
               and ‘4G’, depending on the cipher.  The optional second value is specified in seconds and may use
               any of the units documented in the “TIME FORMATS” section.  The default value for  <b>RekeyLimit</b>  is
               <b>default</b>  <b>none</b>,  which  means that rekeying is performed after the cipher's default amount of data
               has been sent or received and no time based rekeying is done.

       <b>RequiredRSASize</b>
               Specifies the minimum RSA key size (in bits) that  <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)  will  accept.   User  and  host-based
               authentication  keys  smaller  than  this limit will be refused.  The default is <b>1024</b> bits.  Note
               that this limit may only be raised from the default.

       <b>RevokedKeys</b>
               Specifies revoked public keys file, or <b>none</b> to not use one.  Keys listed in  this  file  will  be
               refused  for  public key authentication.  Note that if this file is not readable, then public key
               authentication will be refused for all users.  Keys may be specified as a text file, listing  one
               public  key  per  line, or as an OpenSSH Key Revocation List (KRL) as generated by <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></u>(1).
               For more information on KRLs, see the KEY REVOCATION LISTS section in <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></u>(1).

       <b>SecurityKeyProvider</b>
               Specifies a path to a library that will be used  when  loading  FIDO  authenticator-hosted  keys,
               overriding the default of using the built-in USB HID support.

       <b>SetEnv</b>  Specifies  one  or  more  environment  variables  to  set in child sessions started by <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) as
               “NAME=VALUE”.  The environment value may be quoted (e.g. if it contains  whitespace  characters).
               Environment  variables set by <b>SetEnv</b> override the default environment and any variables specified
               by the user via <b>AcceptEnv</b> or <b>PermitUserEnvironment</b>.

       <b>SshdAuthPath</b>
               Overrides  the  default  path  to  the  <b>sshd-auth</b>  binary  that  is  invoked  to  complete   user
               authentication.   The  default is <u>/usr/lib/openssh/sshd-auth</u>.  This option is intended for use by
               tests.

       <b>SshdSessionPath</b>
               Overrides the default path to the <b>sshd-session</b> binary that is invoked to handle each  connection.
               The default is <u>/usr/lib/openssh/sshd-session</u>.  This option is intended for use by tests.

       <b>StreamLocalBindMask</b>
               Sets  the  octal file creation mode mask (umask) used when creating a Unix-domain socket file for
               local or remote port forwarding.  This option is only used for port forwarding to  a  Unix-domain
               socket file.

               The  default value is 0177, which creates a Unix-domain socket file that is readable and writable
               only by the owner.  Note that not all operating systems honor the file mode on Unix-domain socket
               files.

       <b>StreamLocalBindUnlink</b>
               Specifies whether to remove an  existing  Unix-domain  socket  file  for  local  or  remote  port
               forwarding   before   creating   a   new   one.    If   the   socket   file  already  exists  and
               <b>StreamLocalBindUnlink</b> is not enabled, <b>sshd</b> will be unable to forward the port to the  Unix-domain
               socket file.  This option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.

               The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>.  The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>StrictModes</b>
               Specifies  whether  <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)  should  check  file modes and ownership of the user's files and home
               directory  before  accepting  login.   This  is  normally  desirable  because  novices  sometimes
               accidentally  leave their directory or files world-writable.  The default is <b>yes</b>.  Note that this
               does not apply to <b>ChrootDirectory</b>, whose permissions and ownership are checked unconditionally.

       <b>Subsystem</b>
               Configures an external subsystem (e.g. file transfer daemon).  Arguments should  be  a  subsystem
               name and a command (with optional arguments) to execute upon subsystem request.

               The command <b>sftp-server</b> implements the SFTP file transfer subsystem.

               Alternately  the  name  <b>internal-sftp</b>  implements  an  in-process SFTP server.  This may simplify
               configurations using <b>ChrootDirectory</b> to force a different filesystem root on clients.  It accepts
               the same command line arguments as <b>sftp-server</b> and even though it is in-process, settings such as
               <b>LogLevel</b> or <b>SyslogFacility</b> do not apply to it  and  must  be  set  explicitly  via  command  line
               arguments.

               By default no subsystems are defined.

       <b>SyslogFacility</b>
               Gives  the  facility  code  that is used when logging messages from <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8).  The possible values
               are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2, LOCAL3, LOCAL4,  LOCAL5,  LOCAL6,  LOCAL7.   The
               default is AUTH.

       <b>TCPKeepAlive</b>
               Specifies  whether  the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the other side.  If they are
               sent, death of the connection or crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed.  However,
               this means that connections will die if the route is down temporarily, and some  people  find  it
               annoying.   On  the other hand, if TCP keepalives are not sent, sessions may hang indefinitely on
               the server, leaving "ghost" users and consuming server resources.

               The default is <b>yes</b> (to send TCP keepalive messages), and the server will notice  if  the  network
               goes down or the client host crashes.  This avoids infinitely hanging sessions.

               To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to <b>no</b>.

               This option was formerly called <b>KeepAlive</b>.

       <b>TrustedUserCAKeys</b>
               Specifies  a file containing public keys of certificate authorities that are trusted to sign user
               certificates for authentication, or <b>none</b> to not use one.  Keys are listed  one  per  line;  empty
               lines  and  comments  starting  with  ‘#’  are  allowed.   If  a  certificate  is  presented  for
               authentication and has its signing CA  key  listed  in  this  file,  then  it  may  be  used  for
               authentication  for any user listed in the certificate's principals list.  Note that certificates
               that lack a list of principals will not be permitted for authentication using  <b>TrustedUserCAKeys</b>.
               For more details on certificates, see the CERTIFICATES section in <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></u>(1).

       <b>UnusedConnectionTimeout</b>
               Specifies  whether and how quickly <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) should close client connections with no open channels.
               Open channels include active shell, command execution or subsystem sessions,  connected  network,
               socket,  agent  or X11 forwardings.  Forwarding listeners, such as those from the <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) <b>-R</b> flag,
               are not considered as open channels and do  not  prevent  the  timeout.   The  timeout  value  is
               specified in seconds or may use any of the units documented in the “TIME FORMATS” section.

               Note that this timeout starts when the client connection completes user authentication but before
               the  client  has  an  opportunity  to open any channels.  Caution should be used when using short
               timeout values, as they may not provide sufficient time for the client to request  and  open  its
               channels before terminating the connection.

               The  default <b>none</b> is to never expire connections for having no open channels.  This option may be
               useful in conjunction with <b>ChannelTimeout</b>.

       <b>UseDNS</b>  Specifies whether <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) should look up the remote host name, and to  check  that  the  resolved
               host name for the remote IP address maps back to the very same IP address.

               If  this  option is set to <b>no</b> (the default) then only addresses and not host names may be used in
               <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a></u> <b>from</b> and <b>sshd_config</b> <b>Match</b> <b>Host</b> directives.

       <b>UsePAM</b>  Enables the Pluggable Authentication Module interface.  If  set  to  <b>yes</b>  this  will  enable  PAM
               authentication  using  <b>KbdInteractiveAuthentication</b> and <b>PasswordAuthentication</b> in addition to PAM
               account and session module processing for all authentication types.

               Because PAM keyboard-interactive authentication usually serves an  equivalent  role  to  password
               authentication, you should disable either <b>PasswordAuthentication</b> or <b>KbdInteractiveAuthentication</b>.

               If <b>UsePAM</b> is enabled, you will not be able to run <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) as a non-root user.  The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>VersionAddendum</b>
               Optionally specifies additional text to append to the SSH protocol banner sent by the server upon
               connection.  The default is <b>none</b>.

       <b>X11DisplayOffset</b>
               Specifies  the  first  display number available for <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)'s X11 forwarding.  This prevents sshd
               from interfering with real X11 servers.  The default is 10.

       <b>X11Forwarding</b>
               Specifies whether X11 forwarding is permitted.  The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>.  The  default  is
               <b>no</b>.

               When  X11  forwarding  is  enabled,  there may be additional exposure to the server and to client
               displays if the <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) proxy display is configured  to  listen  on  the  wildcard  address  (see
               <b>X11UseLocalhost</b>),  though this is not the default.  Additionally, the authentication spoofing and
               authentication data verification and substitution occur on the client side.  The security risk of
               using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11 display server may be exposed to  attack  when  the
               SSH  client  requests  forwarding  (see  the warnings for <b>ForwardX11</b> in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5)).  A system
               administrator may have a stance in which they want to protect clients that may expose  themselves
               to attack by unwittingly requesting X11 forwarding, which can warrant a <b>no</b> setting.

               Note  that  disabling X11 forwarding does not prevent users from forwarding X11 traffic, as users
               can always install their own forwarders.

       <b>X11UseLocalhost</b>
               Specifies whether <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) should bind the X11 forwarding server to the loopback address or to the
               wildcard address.  By default, sshd binds the forwarding server to the loopback address and  sets
               the  hostname  part of the DISPLAY environment variable to <b>localhost</b>.  This prevents remote hosts
               from connecting to the proxy display.  However, some older X11 clients may not function with this
               configuration.  <b>X11UseLocalhost</b> may be set to <b>no</b> to specify that the forwarding server should  be
               bound to the wildcard address.  The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>.  The default is <b>yes</b>.

       <b>XAuthLocation</b>
               Specifies  the  full  pathname  of  the <u><a href="../man1/xauth.1.html">xauth</a></u>(1) program, or <b>none</b> to not use one.  The default is
               <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?xauth">/usr/bin/xauth</a></u>.

</pre><h4><b>TIME</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) command-line arguments and configuration file options that specify time may be expressed using  a
       sequence of the form: <u>time</u>[<u>qualifier</u>], where <u>time</u> is a positive integer value and <u>qualifier</u> is one of the
       following:

             ⟨<b>none</b>⟩  seconds
             <b>s</b> | <b>S</b>   seconds
             <b>m</b> | <b>M</b>   minutes
             <b>h</b> | <b>H</b>   hours
             <b>d</b> | <b>D</b>   days
             <b>w</b> | <b>W</b>   weeks

       Each member of the sequence is added together to calculate the total time value.

       Time format examples:

             600     600 seconds (10 minutes)
             10m     10 minutes
             1h30m   1 hour 30 minutes (90 minutes)

</pre><h4><b>TOKENS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to some keywords can make use of tokens, which are expanded at runtime:

             %%    A literal ‘%’.
             %C    Identifies  the connection endpoints, containing four space-separated values: client address,
                   client port number, server address, and server port number.
             %D    The routing domain in which the incoming connection was received.
             %F    The fingerprint of the CA key.
             %f    The fingerprint of the key or certificate.
             %h    The home directory of the user.
             %i    The key ID in the certificate.
             %K    The base64-encoded CA key.
             %k    The base64-encoded key or certificate for authentication.
             %s    The serial number of the certificate.
             %T    The type of the CA key.
             %t    The key or certificate type.
             %U    The numeric user ID of the target user.
             %u    The username.

       <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand</b> accepts the tokens %%, %C, %D, %f, %h, %k, %t, %U, and %u.

       <b>AuthorizedKeysFile</b> accepts the tokens %%, %h, %U, and %u.

       <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</b> accepts the tokens %%, %C, %D, %F, %f, %h, %i, %K, %k, %s, %T,  %t,  %U,  and
       %u.

       <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b> accepts the tokens %%, %h, %U, and %u.

       <b>ChrootDirectory</b> accepts the tokens %%, %h, %U, and %u.
