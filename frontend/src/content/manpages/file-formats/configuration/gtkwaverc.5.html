</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gtkwaverc - GTKWave Configuration File

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       option &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;

       The configuration file is a series of option and value pairs.  Comment lines marked with an initial '#'
       character are permissible.  Blank lines are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration  file  for  <u><a href="../man1/gtkwave.1.html">gtkwave</a></u>(1).  The search path for the configuration file (if unspecified) is the
       current working directory followed by the user's home directory.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>accel</b> &lt;<u>"pathvalue"</u> <u>accelerator</u>&gt;
              This allows replacement of  menu  accelerator  keys.   See  the  .gtkwaverc  file  in  the  source
              distribution  for  examples on pathvalue and accelerator syntax.  The special accelerator value of
              <u>(null)</u> means that no accelerator is bound to the menu item.

       <b>alt_hier_delimeter</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              This allows another character in addition to the hier_delimeter to be used to  delimit  levels  in
              the  hierarchy  for  VCD.  Only the first character in the value is significant. Note that this is
              normally off. The intended use is to resolve the hierarchies of netlist based  models  that  often
              contain slashes to delimit hierarchy inside of $var statements.

       <b>alt_wheel_mode</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Default  is  on.  Scrollwheel alone pans along a quarter at a time rather than a full page, so you
              don't get lost.  Ctrl+wheel zooms  in/out  around  the  mouse  cursor  position,  not  the  marker
              position.   Alt+wheel  edges  left/right  based  on  the  currently  selected  signal.  This makes
              measuring deltas easier.

       <b>analog_redraw_skip_count</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Specifies how many overlapping analog segments can be drawn  for  a  given  X  position  onscreen.
              (Default: 20)  If there are gaps in analog traces, this value is too low.

       <b>append_vcd_hier</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Allows  the  specification  of  a prefix hierarchy for VCD files. This can be done in "pieces," so
              that multiple layers of hierarchy are prepended to symbol names with the most significant addition
              occurring first (see .gtkwaverc in the  examples/vcd directory). The intended use of  this  is  to
              have  the  ability  to  add "project" prefixes which allow easier selection of everything from the
              tree hierarchy.

       <b>atomic_vectors</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Speeds up vcd loading and takes up less memory. This option is deprecated;  it  is  currently  the
              default.

       <b>autocoalesce</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A  nonzero  value  enables  autocoalescing  of  VCD  vectors  when applicable. This may be toggled
              dynamically during wave viewer usage.

       <b>autocoalesce_reversal</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              causes split vectors to be reconstructed in reverse order (only if autocoalesce is also active).

       <b>autoname_bundles</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A nonzero value indicates that GTKWave will create its own bundle names rather than prompting  the
              user for them.

       <b>clipboard_mouseover</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A  nonzero  value  indicates that when mouseover is enabled, all values generated for the tooltips
              will be automatically copied into the clipboard so they may be pasted into other programs such  as
              text editors, etc.

       <b>color_0</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              trace color when 0.

       <b>color_1</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              trace color when 1.

       <b>color_1fill</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              trace color (inside of box) when 1.

       <b>color_back</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              background color.

       <b>color_baseline</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              middle mouse button marker color.

       <b>color_gmstrd</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              color value for trace groupings.

       <b>color_grid</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              grid  color  (use  Alt-G/Shift-Alt-G  to  show/hide  grid).   This  is  also  the  color  used for
              <b>highlight_wavewindow</b> when enabled.

       <b>color_grid2</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              grid color for secondary pattern search.

       <b>color_high</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;

       <b>color_highfill</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              trace color (inside of box) when high ("H").

       <b>color_low</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              trace color when low ("L").

       <b>color_ltblue</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              color for shadowed traces.

       <b>color_mid</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              trace color when floating ("Z").

       <b>color_normal</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              color value for "normal" GTK state in signal window.

       <b>color_time</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              text color for timebar.

       <b>color_timeb</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              text color for timebar's background.

       <b>color_trans</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              trace color when transitioning.

       <b>color_u</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              trace color when undefined ("U").

       <b>color_ufill</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              trace color (inside of box) when undefined ("U").

       <b>color_umark</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              color of the unnamed (primary) marker.

       <b>color_value</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              text color for vector values.

       <b>color_vbox</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              vector color (horizontal).

       <b>color_vtrans</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              vector color (verticals/transitions).

       <b>color_w</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              trace color when weak ("W").

       <b>color_wfill</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              trace color (inside of box) when weak ("W").

       <b>color_white</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              color value for "white" in signal window.

       <b>color_x</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              trace color when undefined ("X") (collision for VHDL).

       <b>color_xfill</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              trace color (inside of box) when undefined ("X") (collision for VHDL).

       <b>constant_marker_update</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A nonzero value indicates that the values for traces listed in the signal window are to be updated
              constantly when the left mouse button is being held down rather than only when it is first pressed
              then when released (which is the default).

       <b>context_tabposition</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Use zero for tabbed viewing with named tabs at the top.  Nonzero places numerically  indexed  tabs
              at the left.

       <b>convert_to_reals</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Converts  all integer and parameter VCD declarations to real-valued ones when set to a nonzero/yes
              value. The positive aspect of this is that integers and parameters will  take  up  less  space  in
              memory  and  will  automatically  display  in  decimal format. The negative aspect of this is that
              integers and parameters will only be displayable as decimals and can't be bit reversed,  inverted,
              etc.

       <b>cursor_snap</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A  nonzero  value  indicates the number of pixels the marker should snap to for the nearest signal
              transition.

       <b>disable_ae2_alias</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A nonzero value indicates that the AE2 loader is to ignore the  aliasdb  keyword  and  is  not  to
              construct facility aliases.

       <b>disable_auto_comphier</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A  nonzero  value  indicates  that  the  loaders  that  support  compressed hierarchies should not
              automatically turn on compression if the threshold count of signals (500000) has been reached.

       <b>disable_empty_gui</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A nonzero value indicates that if gtkwave is invoked  without  a  dumpfile  name,  then  an  empty
              gtkwave  session is to be suppressed.  Default is a zero value: to bring up an empty session which
              needs a file loaded or dragged into it.

       <b>disable_mouseover</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A nonzero value indicates that signal/value tooltip pop up bubbles on mouse button presses  should
              be  disabled  in  the  value  window.  A zero value indicates that value tooltips should be active
              (default is disabled).

       <b>disable_tooltips</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A nonzero value indicates that tooltip pop up bubbles should be disabled. A zero  value  indicates
              that tooltips should be active (default).

       <b>do_initial_zoom_fit</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A  nonzero  value  indicates that the trace should initially be crunched to fit the screen. A zero
              value indicates that the initial zoom should be zero (default).

       <b>dragzoom_threshold</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A nonzero value indicates the number of pixels in the x direction the marker must  move  in  order
              for a dragzoom to be triggered.  This is largely to handle noisy input devices.

       <b>dynamic_resizing</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A  nonzero  value  indicates  that  dynamic resizing should be initially enabled (default). A zero
              value indicates that dynamic resizing should be initially disabled.

       <b>editor</b> &lt;<u>"value"</u>&gt;
              This is used to specify a string (quotes mandatory) for when gtkwave invokes a text editor  (e.g.,
              Open  Source  Definition).   Examples  are: editor "vimx -g +%d %s", editor "gedit +%d %s", editor
              "emacs +%d %s", and for OSX, editor "mate -l %d %s".  The %d may be combined with other characters
              in a string such as +, etc.  The %s argument must stand by itself.  Note that if this rc  variable
              is  not  set,  then  the  environment variable GTKWAVE_EDITOR will be consulted next, then finally
              gedit will be used (if found).

       <b>enable_fast_exit</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Allows exit without bringing up a confirmation requester. The default is nonzero/yes.

       <b>enable_ghost_marker</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              lets the user turn on/off the ghost marker during primary marker dragging. Default is enabled.

       <b>enable_horiz_grid</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A nonzero value indicates that when grid drawing is enabled, horizontal lines  are  to  be  drawn.
              This is the default.

       <b>enable_vcd_autosave</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              causes  the  vcd  loader to automatically generate a .sav file (vcd_autosave.sav ) in the cwd if a
              save file is not specified on the command line. Note that this mirrors the VCD $var  defs  and  no
              attempt is made to coalesce split bitvectors back together.

       <b>enable_vert_grid</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A  nonzero value indicates that when grid drawing is enabled, vertical lines are to be drawn. This
              is the default. Note that all possible  combinations  of  enable_horiz_grid  and  enable_vert_grid
              values are acceptable.

       <b>fill_waveform</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A zero value indicates that the waveform should not be filled for 1/H values. This is the default.

       <b>fontname_logfile</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              When followed by an argument, this indicates the name of the X11 font that you wish to use for the
              logfile browser. You may generate appropriate fontnames using the xfontsel program.

       <b>fontname_signals</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              When  followed  by  an  argument, this indicates the name of the X11 font that you wish to use for
              signals. You may generate appropriate fontnames using the xfontsel program.

       <b>fontname_waves</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              When followed by an argument, this indicates the name of the X11 font that you  wish  to  use  for
              waves.  You  may  generate  appropriate fontnames using the xfontsel program. Note that the signal
              font must be taller than the wave font or the viewer will complain then terminate.

       <b>force_toolbars</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              When enabled, this forces everything above the signal and wave windows to be rendered as toolbars.
              This allows for them to be detached which allows for more usable wave  viewer  space.  By  default
              this is off.

       <b>hide_sst</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Hides  the  Signal Search Tree widget for GTK2.4 and greater such that it is not embedded into the
              main viewer window.  It is still reachable as an external widget through the menus.

       <b>hier_delimeter</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              This allows characters other than '/' to be used to delimit levels  in  the  hierarchy.  Only  the
              first character in the value is significant.

       <b>hier_grouping</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              For  the  tree  widgets,  this  allows the hierarchies to be grouped in a single place rather than
              spread among the netnames.

       <b>hier_ignore_escapes</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A nonzero value indicates that the signal pane ignores escapes in identifiers when determining the
              hierarchy maximum depth.  Default is disabled so that escapes are examined.

       <b>hier_max_level</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Sets the maximum hierarchy depth (from the right side) to display for trace  names.  Note  that  a
              value of zero displays the full hierarchy name.

       <b>highlight_wavewindow</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              When  enabled,  this  causes traces highlighted in the signal window also to be highlighted in the
              wave window.

       <b>hpane_pack</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A nonzero value indicates that the horizontal pane should be constructed using the  gtk_paned_pack
              functions  (default  and  recommended).  A  zero  value  indicates that gtk_paned_add will be used
              instead.

       <b>ignore_savefile_pane_pos</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              If nonzero, specifies that the pane position attributes (i.e., signal window width  size,  SST  is
              expanded,  etc.)  are  to  be  ignored during savefile loading and is to be skipped during saving.
              Default is that the attribute is used.

       <b>ignore_savefile_pos</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              If nonzero, specifies that the window position attribute is to be ignored during savefile  loading
              and is to be skipped during saving.  Default is that the position attribute is used.

       <b>ignore_savefile_size</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              If  nonzero, specifies that the window size attribute is to be ignored during savefile loading and
              is to be skipped during saving.  Default is that the size attribute is used.

       <b>initial_signal_window_width</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Sets the creation width for the signal pane on GUI initialization.  Also  sets  another  potential
              minimum value for dynamic resizing.

       <b>initial_window_x</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Sets  the  size  of the initial width of the wave viewer window. Values less than or equal to zero
              will set the initial width equal to -1 which will let GTK determine the minimum size.

       <b>initial_window_xpos</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Sets the size of the initial x coordinate of the wave  viewer  window.  -1  will  let  the  window
              manager determine the position.

       <b>initial_window_y</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Sets  the  size of the initial height of the wave viewer window. Values less than or equal to zero
              will set the initial width equal to -1 which will let GTK determine the minimum size.

       <b>initial_window_ypos</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Sets the size of the initial y coordinate of the wave  viewer  window.  -1  will  let  the  window
              manager determine the position.

       <b>keep_xz_colors</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              When  nonzero,  indicates  that  the original color scheme for non 0/1 signal values is to be used
              when Color Format overrides are in effect.  Default is off.

       <b>left_justify_sigs</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              When nonzero, indicates that the signal window signal name justification should default  to  left,
              else the justification is to the right (default).

       <b>lxt_clock_compress_to_z</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              For LXT (not LXT2) allows clocks to compress to a 'z' value so that regular/periodic value changes
              may be noted.

       <b>lz_removal</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              When  nonzero, suppresses the display of leading zeros on non-filtered traces.  This has no effect
              on filtered traces.

       <b>max_fsdb_trees</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              sets the maximum number of hierarchy and signal trees to process for an FSDB file.  Default = 0  =
              unlimited.   The  intent  of  this  is  to  work  around  sim  environments that accidentally call
              fsdbDumpVars multiple times.

       <b>page_divisor</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Sets the scroll amount for page left and right operations.  (The  buttons,  not  the  hscrollbar.)
              Values over 1.0 are taken as 1/x and values equal to and less than 1.0 are taken literally. (i.e.,
              2 gives a half-page scroll and .67 gives 2/3). The default is 1.0.

       <b>ps_maxveclen</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              sets the maximum number of characters that can be printed for a value in the signal window portion
              of a postscript file (not including the net name itself). Legal values are 4 through 66 (default).

       <b>ruler_origin</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              sets the zero origin for alternate time tick marks.

       <b>ruler_step</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              sets the left/right step value for the alternate time tick marks from the origin.  When this value
              is zero, alternate time tick marks are disabled.

       <b>scale_to_time_dimension</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              The  value  can be any of the characters m, u, n, f, p, or s, which indicates which time dimension
              to convert the time values to. The  default  for  this  is  *  which  means  that  time  dimension
              conversion is disabled.

       <b>show_base_symbols</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A  nonzero  value  (default) indicates that the numeric base symbols for hexadecimal ('$'), binary
              ('%'), and octal ('#') should be rendered. Otherwise they will be omitted.

       <b>show_grid</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A nonzero value (default) indicates that a  grid  should  be  drawn  behind  the  traces.  A  zero
              indicates that no grid should be drawn.

       <b>splash_disable</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Turning  this  off enables the splash screen with the GTKWave mascot when loading a trace. Default
              is on.

       <b>sst_dbl_action_type</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Allows double-clicking to be active in the SST signals pane with the following  actions  possible:
              insert  (default),  replace,  append,  prepend,  none.  The value specified for the action is case
              insensitive and only the first letter is required.  Invalid action types default to none.

       <b>sst_dynamic_filter</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              When true (default) allows the SST dialog signal filter to filter signals  while  keys  are  being
              pressed, otherwise enter must be pressed to cause the filter to go active.

       <b>sst_expanded</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              When true allows the SST dialog (when not hidden) to come up already expanded.

       <b>strace_repeat_count</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Determines  how  many  times  that  edge search and pattern search will iterate on a search.  This
              allows, for example, skipping ahead 10 clock edges instead of 1.

       <b>use_big_fonts</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A nonzero value indicates that any text rendered into the wave window will use fonts that are four
              points larger in size than normal. This can enhance  readability.  A  zero  value  indicates  that
              normal font sizes should be used.

       <b>use_fat_lines</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A  nonzero  value  indicates  that any lines rendered into the wave window will be two pixels wide
              instead of a single pixel in width. This can enhance readability.  A  zero  value  indicates  that
              normal line widths should be used.

       <b>use_frequency_delta</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              allows you to switch between the delta time and frequency display in the upper right corner of the
              main  window when measuring distances between markers.  Default behavior is that the delta time is
              displayed (off).

       <b>use_gestures</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              if supported by the GTK version will enable gestures such as swipe in the wave window. The default
              is that this feature is enabled if a touch screen is available (value is "maybe").  Values  of  on
              or off are also permissible.

       <b>use_full_precision</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              does  not  round  time  values when the number of ticks per pixel onscreen is greater than 10 when
              active. The default is that this feature is disabled.

       <b>use_maxtime_display</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A nonzero value indicates that the maximum time will be displayed in the upper right corner of the
              screen. Otherwise, the current primary (unnamed) marker  time  will  be  displayed.  This  can  be
              toggled at any time with the Toggle Max-Marker menu option.

       <b>use_nonprop_fonts</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Allows  accelerated  redraws  of  the  signalwindow  that  can  be  done because the font width is
              constant. Default is off.

       <b>use_pango_fonts</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Uses anti-aliased pango fonts (GTK2) rather than bitmapped X11 ones. Default is on.

       <b>use_roundcaps</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A nonzero value indicates that vector traces  should  be  drawn  with  rounded  caps  rather  than
              perpendicular ones. The default for this is zero.

       <b>use_scrollbar_only</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A  nonzero  value  indicates  that the page, shift, fetch, and discard buttons should not be drawn
              (i.e., time manipulations should be through the scrollbar only rather than front  panel  buttons).
              The default for this is zero.

       <b>use_scrollwheel_as_y</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A  nonzero value indicates that the scroll wheel on the mouse should be used to scroll the signals
              up and down rather than scrolling the time value from left to right.

       <b>use_standard_clicking</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              This option no longer has any effect in gtkwave: normal  GTK  click  semantics  are  used  in  the
              signalwindow.

       <b>use_standard_trace_select</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A  nonzero  value keeps the currently selected traces from deselecting on mouse button press. This
              allows drag and drop to function more  smoothly.   As  this  behavior  is  not  how  GTK  normally
              functions, it is by default disabled.

       <b>use_toolbutton_interface</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              A  nonzero  value indicates that a toolbar with buttons should be at the top of the screen instead
              of the traditional style gtkwave button groups.  Default is on.

       <b>vcd_explicit_zero_subscripts</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              indicates that signal names should be stored  internally  as  name.bitnumber  when  enabled.  When
              disabled, a more "normal" ordering of name[bitnumber] is used. Note that when disabled, the Bundle
              Up and Bundle Down options are disabled in the Signal Search Regexp,  Signal Search Hierarchy, and
              Signal  Search  Tree  options.  This  is necessary as the internal data structures for signals are
              represented with one "less" level of hierarchy than when enabled and  those  functions  would  not
              work  properly.  This  should  not  be  an  issue  if  atomic_vectors  are  enabled.  Default  for
              vcd_explicit_zero_subscripts is disabled.

       <b>vcd_preserve_glitches</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              indicates that any repeat equal values for a net spanning different time  values  in  the  VCD/FST
              file  are  not  to  be  compressed  into a single value change but should remain in order to allow
              glitches to be present for this case. Default for vcd_preserve_glitches is disabled.

       <b>vcd_preserve_glitches_real</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              indicates that any repeat equal values for a real  net  spanning  different  time  values  in  the
              VCD/FST  file are not to be compressed into a single value change but should remain for this case.
              Default for vcd_preserve_glitches is disabled.  The  intended  use  is  for  when  viewing  analog
              interpolated data such that removing duplicate values would incorrectly deform the interpolation.

       <b>vcd_warning_filesize</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              produces  a warning message if the VCD filesize is greater than the argument's size in MB.  Set to
              zero to disable this.

       <b>vector_padding</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              indicates the number of pixels of extra whitespace that should be added to  any  strings  for  the
              purpose of calculating text in vectors. Permissible values are 0 to 16 with the default being 4.

       <b>vlist_compression</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              indicates  the  value  to pass to zlib during vlist processing (which is used in the VCD recoder).
              -1 disables compression, 0-9 correspond to the value zlib expects.  4 is default.

       <b>vlist_prepack</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              indicates that the VCD recoder should pre-compress data going into  the  value  change  vlists  in
              order to reduce memory usage. This is done before potential zlib packing.  Default is off.

       <b>vlist_spill</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              indicates that the VCD recoder should spill all generated vlists to a tempfile on disk in order to
              reduce memory usage. Default is off.

       <b>wave_scrolling</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              a  nonzero  value enables scrolling by dragging the marker off the left or right sides of the wave
              window. A zero value disables it.

       <b>zoom_base</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              allows setting of the zoom base with a value between 1.5 and 10.0. Default is 2.0.

       <b>zoom_center</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              a nonzero value enables center zooming, a zero value disables it.

       <b>zoom_dynamic</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              a nonzero value enables dynamic full zooming when using the partial VCD  (incremental)  loader,  a
              zero value disables it.

       <b>zoom_dynamic_end</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              a nonzero value enables dynamic zoom to the end when using the partial VCD (incremental) loader, a
              zero value disables it.

       <b>zoom_pow10_snap</b> &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              corresponds to the Zoom Pow10 Snap menu option. Default for this is disabled (zero).
