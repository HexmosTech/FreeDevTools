       tayga.conf - configuration file of the TAYGA stateless NAT64 daemon

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  file contains the configuration parameters for the TAYGA stateless NAT64 daemon.  It must exist and
       contain the mandatory configuration items or TAYGA will refuse to run.

       The configuration directives are listed below.  With  the  exception  of  the  <b>map</b>  directive,  only  one
       instance of each directive may appear in tayga.conf.

       <b>tun-device</b> <u>device</u>
              Name  of the network interface that will be created by the kernel TUN module for TAYGA to exchange
              IPv4 and IPv6 packets with the in-kernel TCP/IP stack.  If <u>device</u> does  not  already  exist  as  a
              persistent  interface  (created  by the <b>--mktun</b> flag to <a href="../man8/tayga.8.html">tayga</a>(8), for example), it will be created
              automatically when the TAYGA daemon starts and destroyed when the daemon exits.

              Note that TAYGA does not configure the host-side parameters of <u>device.</u>  This must be done  by  the
              system administrator using the <a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a>(8), <a href="../man8/route.8.html">route</a>(8), and/or <a href="../man8/ip.8.html">ip</a>(8) commands.

              This configuration directive is mandatory.

       <b>ipv4-addr</b> <u>ipv4_address</u>
              IPv4  address  that  TAYGA  will  use  as  the  source  address for ICMPv4 errors generated by the
              translation process.  TAYGA will also respond to ICMP echo requests (pings) at this address.

              <u>ipv4_address</u> is permitted to overlap with the prefix specified in the <b>dynamic-pool</b>  directive,  in
              which case <u>ipv4_address</u> will be removed from the pool of available addresses.

              This configuration directive is mandatory.

       <b>ipv6-addr</b> <u>ipv6_address</u>
              IPv6  address  that  TAYGA  will  use  as  the  source  address for ICMPv6 errors generated by the
              translation process.  TAYGA will also respond to ICMPv6 echo requests (pings) at this address.

              This configuration directive is mandatory unless the NAT64 prefix is  specified  with  the  <b>prefix</b>
              directive,  in which case TAYGA will generate its IPv6 address by mapping the address specified in
              <b>ipv4-addr</b> into the NAT64 prefix.

       <b>prefix</b> <u>ipv6_address/length</u>
              NAT64 prefix for mapping IPv4 addresses into the  IPv6  address  space.   TAYGA  performs  address
              translation  as  specified  in  RFC 6052, and only prefix lengths allowed in that document will be
              permitted in the <b>prefix</b> directive.

              The use of either a Network-Specific Prefix or the Well-Known Prefix  (64:ff9b::/96)  is  allowed,
              <b>however,</b>  as  required  by  RFC  6052,  TAYGA  will  refuse  to translate packets with a source or
              destination address composed of the Well-Known Prefix and a  non-global  IPv4  address  (10.x.x.x,
              192.168.x.x, etc).

              Use  of  the <b>prefix</b> directive is optional.  If it is not specified, all addresses to be translated
              must be listed individually with the <b>map</b> directive.

       <b>map</b> <u>ipv4_address[/length]</u> <u>ipv6_address[/length]</u>
              Creates a static mapping between RFC 7577 compliant hosts  or  subnets  <u>ipv4_address[/length]</u>  and
              <u>ipv6_address[/length]</u>  to  be  used when translating IPv4 packets to IPv6 or IPv6 packets to IPv4.
              If <u>/length</u> is not present, the <u>/length</u>  after  <u>ipv4_address</u>  is  treated  as  "/32"  and  that  of
              <u>ipv6_address</u> as "/128".  Multiple <b>map</b> directives are permitted in the tayga.conf file.

              <u>ipv4_address</u>  is  permitted to overlap with the prefix specified in the <b>dynamic-pool</b> directive, in
              which case <u>ipv4_address</u> will be removed from the pool of available addresses.

              <u>ipv6_address</u> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> overlap with the prefix specified in the <b>prefix</b> directive.

       <b>dynamic-pool</b> <u>ipv4_address/length</u>
              Address prefix containing addresses available to be assigned to IPv6 hosts.  <u>length</u> must be 31  or
              less, as the lowest-numbered address in the prefix is considered reserved and will not be used for
              dynamic assignment.

              If  TAYGA receives an IPv6 packet to be translated with an IPv6 source address that does not match
              any existing mapping rules (as specified by the <b>map</b> directive or the <b>prefix</b> directive), TAYGA will
              create a dynamic mapping between the IPv6 address and  an  IPv4  address  drawn  from  the  prefix
              specified  by  the  <b>dynamic-pool</b>  directive.   This  mapping  will be valid for two hours and four
              minutes after the last packet matching the mapping is translated.

              The <b>dynamic-pool</b> directive is optional.  If it is not specified, all IPv6 addresses  appearing  in
              packets passing through TAYGA must match the NAT64 prefix or a static mapping rule.

       <b>data-dir</b> <u>path</u>
              The absolute path of a directory where TAYGA should store its data files.  Presently the only data
              file  that TAYGA will store is the <u>dynamic.map</u> file, which tracks dynamic address assignments made
              from the dynamic pool.

              <u>path</u> is also the directory that will be used as a <a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</a>(2) "jail" if  the  <b>--chroot</b>  command-line
              option is specified to the TAYGA daemon.

              The  TAYGA  daemon  must  have  full  permissions  (rwx)  to  <u>path</u>  after it has dropped superuser
              privileges.  Generally this means that the owner of <u>path</u> should  be  the  user  specified  in  the
              <b>--user</b> command-line option.

              The  <b>data-dir</b>  directive is optional, but without it, dynamic mappings will be lost when the TAYGA
              daemon is stopped.  Also, use of the <b>--chroot</b> command-line option will not be possible.

       <b>strict-frag-hdr</b> <u>on|off|true|false|1|0</u>
              Flag to control whether TAYGA adds fragmentation headers to  IPv6  packets  that  do  not  require
              fragmentation.   RFC  6145  stipulates  that  the  fragmentation  header  SHOULD  be  added to all
              translated packets when the sender has not set the DF (Don't Fragment) flag, to indicate that  the
              sender  allows fragmentation and may not support path MTU discovery.  Unfortunately, some firewall
              implementations drop IPv6 packets that are fragmented into a single fragment, most  notably  Linux
              netfilter conntrack in kernels older than 2.6.34.

              When  <b>strict-frag-hdr</b>  is  set  to  <b>true,</b>  <b>on,</b>  or  <b>1,</b>  fragmentation headers will be added to all
              translated packets where the DF bit in the original packet is clear.  This  is  the  RFC-complaint
              behavior.

              When <b>strict-frag-hdr</b> is set to <b>false,</b> <b>off,</b> or <b>0,</b> fragmentation headers will be suppressed when the
              translated  packet  fits  entirely  within the IPv6 network MTU (1280 bytes).  This is the default
              behavior.

              This setting does not affect packets that arrive at TAYGA already fragmented, or packets that must
              be fragmented to fit within the IPv6 network MTU.
