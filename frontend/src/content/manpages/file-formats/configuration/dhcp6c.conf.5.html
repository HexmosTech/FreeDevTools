</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dhcp6c.conf — DHCPv6 client configuration file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/wide-dhcpv6/dhcp6c.conf</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>dhcp6c.conf</b>  file  contains  configuration  information  for  KAME's  DHCPv6  client,  <b>dhcp6c</b>.   The
       configuration file consists of a sequence of statements terminated by a semi-colon (`;').  Statements are
       composed of tokens separated by white space, which can be any combination of blanks, tabs  and  newlines.
       In  some  cases  a  set  of statements is combined with a pair of brackets, which is regarded as a single
       token.  Lines beginning with ‘#’ are comments.

</pre><h4><b>Interface</b> <b>specification</b></h4><pre>
       There are some statements that may or have to specify interface.  Interfaces are specified in the form of
       "name unit", such as <u>fxp0</u> and <u>gif1.</u>

</pre><h4><b>DHCPv6</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       Some configuration statements take the description of a DHCPv6 option as an argument.  The followings are
       the format and description of available DHCPv6 options.
       <b>domain-name-servers</b>
               means a Domain Name Server option.
       <b>domain-name</b>
               means a domain name option.
       <b>ntp-servers</b>
               means an NTP server option.  As of  this  writing,  the  option  type  for  this  option  is  not
               officially  assigned.  <b>dhcp6c</b> will reject this option unless it is explicitly built to accept the
               option.
       <b>sip-server-address</b>
               means a SIP Server address option.
       <b>sip-server-domain-name</b>
               means a SIP server domain name option.
       <b>nis-server-address</b>
               means a NIS Server address option.
       <b>nis-domain-name</b>
               means a NIS domain name option.
       <b>nisp-server-address</b>
               means a NIS+ Server address option.
       <b>nisp-domain-name</b>
               means a NIS+ domain name option.
       <b>bcmcs-server-address</b>
               means a BCMCS Server address option.
       <b>bcmcs-server-domain-name</b>
               means a BCMCS server domain name option.
       <b>ia-pd</b> <u>ID</u>
               means an IA_PD (Identity Association for Prefix Delegation) option.  <u>ID</u> is a  decimal  number  of
               the IAID (see below about identity associations).
       <b>ia-na</b> <u>ID</u>
               means an IA_NA (Identity Association for Non-temporary Addresses) option.  <u>ID</u> is a decimal number
               of the IAID (see below about identity associations).
       <b>rapid-commit</b>
               means a rapid-commit option.
       <b>authentication</b> <u>authname</u>
               means an authentication option.  <u>authname</u> is a string specifying parameters of the authentication
               protocol.  An <b>authentication</b> statement for <u>authname</u> must be provided.

</pre><h4><b>Interface</b> <b>statement</b></h4><pre>
       An  interface  statement  specifies  configuration parameters on the interface.  The generic format of an
       interface statement is as follows:
       <b>interface</b> <u>interface</u> { <u>substatements</u> };
               The followings are possible <u>substatements</u> in an interface statement.
               <b>send</b> <u>send-options</u> ;
                       This statement specifies DHCPv6 options to be sent to the server(s).   Some  options  can
                       only  appear  in  particular  messages  according to the specification, in which case the
                       appearance of the options is limited to be compliant with the specification.

                       <u>send-options</u> is a comma-separated list of options, each of which should be  specified  as
                       described  above.   Multiple <b>send</b> statements can also be specified, in which case all the
                       specified options will be sent.

                       When <b>rapid-commit</b> is specified, <b>dhcp6c</b> will include  a  rapid-commit  option  in  solicit
                       messages and wait for an immediate reply instead of advertisements.

                       When <b>ia-pd</b> is specified, <b>dhcp6c</b> will initiate prefix delegation as a requesting router by
                       including an IA_PD option with the specified <u>ID</u> in solicit messages.

                       When <b>ia-na</b> is specified, <b>dhcp6c</b> will initiate stateful address assignment by including an
                       IA_NA option with the specified <u>ID</u> in solicit messages.

                       In  either  case, a corresponding identity association statement must exist with the same
                       <u>ID</u>.
               <b>request</b> <u>request-options</u>;
                       This statement specifies DHCPv6 options to  be  included  in  an  option-request  option.
                       <u>request-options</u>  is a comma-separated list of options, which can consist of the following
                       options.
                       <b>domain-name-servers</b>
                               requests a list of Domain Name Server addresses.
                       <b>domain-name</b>
                               requests a DNS search path.
                       <b>ntp-servers</b>
                               requests a list of NTP server addresses.  As of this writing, the option type for
                               this option is not officially assigned.  <b>dhcp6c</b> will reject this option unless it
                               is explicitly built to accept the option.
                       <b>sip-server-address</b>
                               requests a list of SIP server addresses.
                       <b>sip-domain-name</b>
                               requests a SIP server domain name.
                       <b>nis-server-address</b>
                               requests a list of NIS server addresses.
                       <b>nis-domain-name</b>
                               requests a NIS domain name.
                       <b>nisp-server-address</b>
                               requests a list of NIS+ server addresses.
                       <b>nisp-domain-name</b>
                               requests a NIS+ domain name.
                       <b>bcmcs-server-address</b>
                               requests a list of BCMCS server addresses.
                       <b>bcmcs-domain-name</b>
                               requests a BCMCS domain name.
                       <b>refreshtime</b>
                               means an information refresh time option.  This can only be specified  when  sent
                               with  information-request  messages;  <b>dhcp6c</b>  will  ignore  this option for other
                               messages.
                       Multiple <b>request</b> statements can also be  specified,  in  which  case  all  the  specified
                       options will be requested.
               <b>information-only</b>;
                       This  statement  specifies <b>dhcp6c</b> to only exchange informational configuration parameters
                       with servers.  A list of DNS server addresses is an example  of  such  parameters.   This
                       statement  is useful when the client does not need stateful configuration parameters such
                       as IPv6 addresses or prefixes.
               <b>script</b> <u>"script-name"</u>;
                       This statement specifies a path to script  invoked  by  <b>dhcp6c</b>  on  a  certain  condition
                       including  when  the  daemon  receives a reply message.  <u>script-name</u> must be the absolute
                       path from root to the script file, be a regular file, and be created by  the  same  owner
                       who runs the daemon.

</pre><h4><b>Profile</b> <b>statement</b></h4><pre>
       Some  setups  may  require to configure an interface independently from its name.  Profiles are available
       for this particular purpose.  They follow the same syntax as an interface statement except  they  can  be
       arbitrarily  named.   It  is  then  possible  to choose which profile to use for a given interface on the
       command line.

</pre><h4><b>Identity</b> <b>association</b> <b>statement</b></h4><pre>
       Identity association (IA) is a key notion of DHCPv6.  An IA is uniquely identified in a client by a  pair
       of IA type and IA identifier (IAID).  An IA is associated with configuration information dependent on the
       IA type.

       An  identity  association  statement  defines a single IA with some client-side configuration parameters.
       Its format is as follows:
       <b>id-assoc</b> <u>type</u> [<u>ID</u>] { <u>substatements</u> };
               <u>type</u> is a string for the type of  this  IA.   The  current  implementation  supports  ‘<b>na</b>’  (non-
               temporary  address  allocation) ‘<b>pd</b>’ (prefix delegation) for the IA type.  <u>ID</u> is a decimal number
               of IAID.  If omitted, the value 0 will be used  by  default.   <u>substatements</u>  is  a  sequence  of
               statements that specifies configuration parameters for this IA.  Each statement may or may not be
               specific to the type of IA.

               The followings are possible <u>substatements</u> for an IA of type <b>na</b>.
               <b>address</b> <u>ipv6-address</u> <u>pltime</u> [<u>vltime</u>];
                       specifies  an  address  and  related  parameters  that  the client wants to be allocated.
                       Multiple addresses can be specified, each of which is described  as  a  separate  <b>address</b>
                       substatement.   <b>dhcp6c</b> will include all the addresses (and related parameters) in Solicit
                       messages, as an IA_NA prefix option  encapsulated  in  the  corresponding  IA_NA  option.
                       Note,  however,  that  the server may or may not respect the specified prefix parameters.
                       For parameters of the <b>address</b> substatement, see <u><a href="../man5/dhcp6s.conf.5.html">dhcp6s.conf</a></u>(5).

               The followings are possible <u>substatements</u> for an IA of type <b>pd</b>.
               <u>prefix_interface_statement</u>
                       specifies the client's local configuration of how delegated prefixes should be used  (see
                       below).
               <b>prefix</b> <u>ipv6-prefix</u> <u>pltime</u> [<u>vltime</u>];
                       specifies  a  prefix  and  related  parameters  that  the  client  wants to be delegated.
                       Multiple prefixes can be specified, each of which  is  described  as  a  separate  <b>prefix</b>
                       substatement.   <b>dhcp6c</b>  will include all the prefixes (and related parameters) in Solicit
                       messages, as an IA_PD prefix option  encapsulated  in  the  corresponding  IA_PD  option.
                       Note,  however,  that  the server may or may not respect the specified prefix parameters.
                       For parameters of the <b>prefix</b> substatement, see <u><a href="../man5/dhcp6s.conf.5.html">dhcp6s.conf</a></u>(5).

</pre><h4><b>Prefix</b> <b>interface</b> <b>statement</b></h4><pre>
       A prefix interface statement specifies configuration parameters of prefixes on local interfaces that  are
       derived  from  delegated  prefixes.  A prefix interface statement can only appear as a substatement of an
       identity association statement with the type <b>pd</b>.  The generic format of  an  interface  statement  is  as
       follows:
       <b>prefix-interface</b> <u>interface</u> { <u>substatements</u> };
               When  an  IPv6  prefix  is  delegated  from  a  DHCPv6 server, <b>dhcp6c</b> will assign a prefix on the
               <u>interface</u> unless the interface receives the DHCPv6 message that  contains  the  prefix  with  the
               delegated  prefix  and  the  parameters provided in <u>substatements</u>.  Possible substatements are as
               follows:
               <b>sla-id</b> <u>ID</u> ;
                       This statement specifies the identifier value of the site-level aggregator (SLA)  on  the
                       interface.  <u>ID</u> must be a decimal integer which fits in the length of SLA IDs (see below).
                       For  example,  if  <u>ID</u> is 1 and the client is delegated an IPv6 prefix 2001:db8:ffff::/48,
                       <b>dhcp6c</b> will combine the two values into a single IPv6 prefix,  2001:db8:ffff:1::/64,  and
                       will configure the prefix on the specified <u>interface</u>.
               <b>sla-len</b> <u>length</u> ;
                       This  statement  specifies  the  length  of the SLA ID in bits.  <u>length</u> must be a decimal
                       number between 0 and 128.  If the length is not specified by this statement, the  default
                       value 16 will be used.
               <b>ifid</b> <u>ID</u> ;
                       This  statement  specifies  the  interface id.  <u>ID</u> must be a decimal integer.  It will be
                       combined with the delegated prefix and the sla-id to form a complete  interface  address.
                       The default is to use the EUI-64 address of the <u>interface</u>.
               <b>ifid-random</b>;
                       This  statement  instructs  the client to generate a completely random interface id. This
                       will override the <b>ifid</b> statement, if present. The resulting random interface id  will  be
                       combined with the delegated prefix and the sla-id to form a complete interface address.

</pre><h4><b>Authentication</b> <b>statement</b></h4><pre>
       An  authentication statement defines a set of authentication parameters used in DHCPv6 exchanges with the
       server(s).  The format of an authentication statement is as follows:
       <b>authentication</b> <u>authname</u> { <u>substatements</u> };
               <u>authname</u> is a string which is unique among all authentication  statements  in  the  configuration
               file.   It  will specify a particular set of authentication parameters when <b>authentication</b> option
               is specified in the <b>interface</b> statement.  Possible substatements of the <b>authentication</b>  statement
               are as follows:
               <b>protocol</b> <u>authprotocol</u> ;
                       specifies  the  authentication  protocol.   Currently,  the  only  available  protocol as
                       <u>authprotocol</u> is <b>delayed</b>, which means the DHCPv6 delayed authentication protocol.
               <b>algorithm</b> <u>authalgorithm</u> ;
                       specifies the algorithm for this authentication.  Currently, the only available algorithm
                       is HMAC-MD5, which can be  specified  as  one  of  the  followings:  <b>hmac-md5</b>,  <b>HMAC-MD5</b>,
                       <b>hmacmd5</b>,  or  <b>HMACMD5</b>.  This substatement can be omitted.  In this case, HMAC-MD5 will be
                       used as the algorithm.
               <b>rdm</b> <u>replay-detection-method</u> ;
                       specifies the replay protection method for  this  authentication.   Currently,  the  only
                       available  method  is  <b>monocounter</b>,  which  means  the  use of a monotonically increasing
                       counter.  If this method is specified, <b>dhcp6c</b> will use an NTP-format  timestamp  when  it
                       authenticates  the  message.  This substatement can be omitted, in which case <b>monocounter</b>
                       will be used as the method.

</pre><h4><b>Keyinfo</b> <b>statement</b></h4><pre>
       A keyinfo statement defines a secret key shared with the server(s) to authenticate DHCPv6 messages.   The
       format of a keyinfo statement is as follows:
       <b>keyinfo</b> <u>keyname</u> { <u>substatements</u> };
               <u>keyname</u>  is  an  arbitrary  string.   It  does  not  affect client's behavior but is provided for
               readability of log messages.  Possible substatements of the <b>keyinfo</b> statement are as follows:
               <b>realm</b> <u>"realmname"</u> ;
                       specifies the DHCP realm.  <u>realmname</u> is an arbitrary string, but is typically expected to
                       be a domain name like "kame.net" .
               <b>keyid</b> <u>ID</u> ;
                       specifies the key identifier, <u>ID</u>,  as  a  decimal  number.   A  secret  key  is  uniquely
                       identified within the client by the DHCP realm and the key identifier.
               <b>secret</b> <u>"secret-value"</u> ;
                       specifies  the  shared secret of this key.  <u>"secret-value"</u> is a base-64 encoded string of
                       the secret.
               <b>expire</b> <u>"expiration-time"</u> ;
                       specifies the expiration time of this key.  <u>"expiration-time"</u> should be formatted in  one
                       of  the  followings: <u>yyyy-mm-dd</u> <u>HH:MM</u>, <u>mm-dd</u> <u>HH:MM</u>, or <u>HH:MM</u>, where <u>yyyy</u> is the year with
                       century (e.g., 2004), <u>mm</u> is the month, <u>dd</u> is the day of the month,  <u>HH</u>  is  the  hour  of
                       24-hour  clock,  and  <u>MM</u>  is  the  minute,  each  of  which is given as a decimal number.
                       Additionally, a special keyword <b>forever</b> can be specified as <u>expiration-time</u>, which  means
                       the key has an infinite lifetime and never expires.  This substatement can be omitted, in
                       which case <b>forever</b> will be used by default.

</pre><h4><b>Examples</b></h4><pre>
       The  followings  are  a  sample  configuration  to  be  delegated an IPv6 prefix from an upstream service
       provider.  With this configuration <b>dhcp6c</b> will send solicit messages containing an IA_PD option, with  an
       IAID  0, on to an upstream PPP link, <u>ppp0</u>.  After receiving some prefixes from a server, <b>dhcp6c</b> will then
       configure derived IPv6 prefixes with the SLA ID 1 on a local ethernet interface, <u>ne0</u>.  Note that the IAID
       for the <b>id-assoc</b> statement is 0 according to the default.

       interface ppp0 {
               send ia-pd 0;
       };

       id-assoc pd {
               prefix-interface ne0 {
                       sla-id 1;
               };
       };

       If a shared secret should be configured in both the client and the server for DHCPv6  authentication,  it
       would be specified in the configuration file as follows:

       keyinfo kame-key {
               realm "kame.net";
               keyid 1;
               secret "5pvW2g48OHPvkYMJSw0vZA==";
       };

       One  easy  way of generating a new secret in the base64 format is to execute the <u><a href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl</a></u>(1) command (when
       available) as follows,

       % openssl rand -base64 16

       and copy the output to the <b>dhcp6c.conf</b> file.

       To include an authentication option for DHCPv6 authentication, the <b>interface</b> statement should be modified
       and an <b>authentication</b> statement should be added as follows:

       interface ppp0 {
               send ia-pd 0;
               send authentication kame;
       };

       authentication kame {
               protocol delayed;
       };

       interface fxp0 {
               send ia-na 0;
       };
