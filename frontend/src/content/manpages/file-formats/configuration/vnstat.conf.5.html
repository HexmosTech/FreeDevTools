</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       vnstat.conf - vnStat configuration file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/vnstat.conf</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man1/vnstat.1.html">vnstat</a></b>(1),  <b><a href="../man1/vnstati.1.html">vnstati</a></b>(1)  and  <b><a href="../man8/vnstatd.8.html">vnstatd</a></b>(8)  all  use  the  same configuration file for configuration related
       settings.  Some of the settings are common for all three programs. The file consists of  keyword-argument
       pairs,  one  per line. Empty lines and lines starting with '#' or ';' are interpreted as comments and not
       processed.  Arguments may optionally be enclosed in double quotes (") in  order  to  represent  arguments
       containing spaces. Arguments can be padded with spaces or tabulator characters. A hardcoded default value
       will be used if a keyword can't be found from the configuration file or if the configured value cannot be
       parsed or is outside supported value range.

       The  configuration  file  is  divided  into  three sections based on the usage of each keyword. The first
       section contains keywords that are considered common for all commands, the second section is  for  daemon
       related keywords and the last section is for image output.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>KEYWORDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DatabaseDir</b>
              Specifies  the  directory  where  the  database  is to be stored.  A full path must be given and a
              leading '/' isn't required.

       <b>DayFormat,</b> <b>MonthFormat,</b> <b>TopFormat</b>
              Formatting of date in available outputs. Uses the same format as  <b><a href="../man1/date.1.html">date</a></b>(1).   (vnstat  and  vnstati
              only)

       <b>DefaultDecimals</b>
              Number of decimals to use in outputs. Value range: 0..2 (vnstat and vnstati only)

       <b>EstimateBarVisible</b>
              Show  a  visual representation of the traffic estimation if <b>OutputStyle</b> has been configured with a
              value of 1 or 2 to make the bar column visible.  1 = enabled, 0 =  disabled.   (vnstat  only,  see
              <b>EstimateStyle</b> for vnstati)

       <b>EstimateText</b>
              Replace  default "estimated" text on the estimate line with custom text.  Limited to 9 characters.
              (vnstat and vnstati only)

       <b>EstimateVisible</b>
              Show a line with traffic estimation for the selected time period or alert as the last line of  the
              output  in  output  modes  supporting  it.  Disabling  estimate  visibility also disables estimate
              conditions in <b>--alert</b>.  1 = enabled, 0 = disabled. (vnstat and vnstati only)

       <b>HourlyDecimals</b>
              Number of decimals to use in hourly graph output. Value range: 0..2 (vnstat only)

       <b>HourlySectionStyle</b>
              Select what kind of spacer is used for separating the  numerical  sections  of  the  hourly  graph
              output. 0 = none, 1 = '|', 2 = '][', 3 = '[ ]'.  (vnstat only)

       <b>Interface</b>
              Default  interface  used when no other interface is specified on the command line. Leave empty for
              automatic selection. The automatic selection will prioritize the interface with most  traffic  for
              outputs  doing  database queries.  Queries not using the database will first check if the database
              is available and select the interface with most traffic out those that are  currently  visible  in
              the  system.  If  no database can be read then the first available interface will be used. (vnstat
              and vnstati only)

       <b>InterfaceMatchMethod</b>
              Method for matching interface given for a query to an interface in the database.

              Method 0 requires the interface name to be a case sensitive exact  match.  Method  1  extends  the
              previous  method by allowing a case sensitive exact match of the interface alias. Method 2 extends
              the previous method by allowing a case insensitive exact match of the interface  alias.  Method  3
              extends the previous method by allowing a case insensitive match of the beginning of the interface
              alias.

              Methods will be evaluated in the order described above resulting in exact interface matches always
              taking  precedence.  If  any  interface alias matching method results in multiple matches then the
              interface with the highest total traffic will be used. (vnstat and vnstati only)

       <b>InterfaceOrder</b>
              Interface order in outputs with multiple interfaces. 0 = alphabetical by name, 1 = alphabetical by
              alias. If 1 is selected and multiple interfaces don't have aliases then the interface name will be
              used for defining the order.  (vnstat only)

       <b>List5Mins,</b> <b>ListHours,</b> <b>ListDays,</b> <b>ListMonths,</b> <b>ListYears,</b> <b>ListTop</b>
              Number of entries to show in list outputs unless overridden from the command line.  Set  to  0  to
              show all entries available in the database.  (vnstat and vnstati)

       <b>LiveSpinner</b>
              Show  spinning  animation  at the beginning of <b>-l</b> / <b>--live</b> output line. 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled.
              (vnstat only)

       <b>Locale</b> Locale setting to be used for prints. This replaces the LC_ALL environment variable. Set to "-" or
              leave empty in order to use the system default value. (vnstat and vnstati only)

       <b>OutputStyle</b>
              Modify the content and style of text outputs. 0 = minimal and  narrow  output  for  terminal  with
              limited  width, 1 = normal output with bar column visible, 2 = same as 1 except rate is visible in
              summary output, 3 = rate column is visible in all outputs where  it  is  supported.   (vnstat  and
              vnstati only)

       <b>QueryMode</b>
              Default  query  mode when no parameters are given. 0 = summary, 1 = days, 2 = months, 3 = top, 4 =
              single summary, 5 = short, 6 = years, 7 = hours graph, 8 = xml, 9 = one line,  10  =  json,  11  =
              hours and 12 = 5 minute. (vnstat only)

       <b>RateUnit</b>
              Select  which unit is used when traffic rate is visible. 0 = bytes, 1 = bits.  (vnstat and vnstati
              only)

       <b>RateUnitMode</b>
              Select used prefix when traffic rate is shown  in  bits  per  second.   IEC  binary  prefixes  are
              calculated  with  powers of 1024. SI decimal prefixes are calculated with powers of 1000.  0 = IEC
              binary prefixes (Kibit/s...), 1 = SI decimal prefixes (kbit/s...).  (vnstat and vnstati only)

       <b>RXCharacter,</b> <b>TXCharacter</b>
              Character used for representing the percentual share of received and transmitted traffic  in  list
              mode outputs. (vnstat only)

       <b>RXHourCharacter,</b> <b>TXHourCharacter</b>
              Character used for representing the percentual share of received and transmitted traffic in hourly
              graph output. (vnstat only)

       <b>Sampletime</b>
              Defines how many seconds the <b>-tr</b> option will sample traffic. Value range: 2..600 (vnstat only)

       <b>UnitMode</b>
              Select  how  units are prefixed. IEC and JEDEC binary prefixes are calculated with powers of 1024.
              SI  decimal  prefixes  are  calculated  with  powers  of  1000.   0  =   IEC   standard   prefixes
              (B/KiB/MiB/GiB...),  1  =  old  style  (JEDEC)  binary  prefixes  (B/KB/MB/GB...), 2 = SI decimals
              prefixes (B/kB/MB/GB...)  (vnstat and vnstati only)

</pre><h4><b>DAEMON</b> <b>RELATED</b> <b>KEYWORDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>5MinuteHours</b>
              Data retention duration for the 5 minute resolution entries. The  configuration  defines  for  how
              many  past  hours  entries  will be stored. Set to -1 for unlimited entries or to 0 to disable the
              data collection of this resolution.

       <b>64bitInterfaceCounters</b>
              Select interface counter handling. Set to 1 for defining that all interfaces use  64-bit  counters
              on the kernel side and 0 for defining 32-bit counter. Set to -1 for using the old style logic used
              in  earlier  versions  where  counter  values within 32-bits are assumed to be 32-bit and anything
              larger is assumed to be a 64-bit counter. This may produce false results if a  64-bit  counter  is
              reset  within  the  32-bits.  Set  to  -2  for using automatic detection based on available kernel
              datastructures.

       <b>AlwaysAddNewInterfaces</b>
              Enable or disable automatic creation of new database entries for interfaces not currently  in  the
              database even if the database file already exists when the daemon is started. New database entries
              will  also  get created for new interfaces seen while the daemon is running. Pseudo interfaces lo,
              lo0 and sit0 are always excluded from getting added.  1 = enabled, 0 = disabled.

       <b>BandwidthDetection</b>
              Try to automatically detect <b>MaxBandwidth</b> value for each monitored interface. Mostly only  ethernet
              interfaces  support this feature.  <b>MaxBandwidth</b> will be used as fallback value if detection fails.
              Any interface specific <b>MaxBW</b> configuration will disable the detection for the specified interface.
              In Linux, the detection is disabled for tun interfaces due to the Linux kernel always reporting 10
              Mbit regardless of the used real interface.  1 = enabled, 0 = disabled.

       <b>BandwidthDetectionInterval</b>
              How often in minutes interface specific detection of <b>MaxBandwidth</b> is done for  detecting  possible
              changes when <b>BandwidthDetection</b> is enabled. Can be disabled by setting to 0. Value range: 0..30

       <b>BootVariation</b>
              Time  in  seconds  how  much  the boot time reported by system kernel can variate between updates.
              Value range: 0..300

       <b>CheckDiskSpace</b>
              Enable or disable the availability check of at least some free disk space before a database write.
              1 = enabled, 0 = disabled.

       <b>CreateDirs</b>
              Enable or disable the creation of directories when a configured path doesn't exist. This  includes
              <b>DatabaseDir</b>  ,  <b>LogFile</b>  and  <b>PidFile</b> directories. The <b>LogFile</b> directory will be created only when
              <b>UseLogging</b> has been set to 1. The <b>PidFile</b> directory will be created only if the daemon is  started
              as a background process.  The daemon process will try to create the directory using permissions of
              the user used to start the process.

       <b>DaemonGroup</b>
              Specify  the group to which the daemon process should switch during startup.  The group can either
              be the name of the group or a numerical group id.  Leave empty to disable  group  switching.  This
              option can only be used when the process is started as root.

       <b>DaemonUser</b>
              Specify the user to which the daemon process should switch during startup.  The user can either be
              the  login of the user or a numerical user id.  Leave empty to disable user switching. This option
              can only be used when the process is started as root.

       <b>DailyDays</b>
              Data retention duration for the one day resolution entries. The configuration defines for how many
              past days entries will be stored. Set to -1 for unlimited entries or to  0  to  disable  the  data
              collection of this resolution.

       <b>DatabaseSynchronous</b>
              Change  the  setting  of  the  SQLite  "synchronous" flag which controls how much care is taken to
              ensure disk writes have fully completed when writing data to the database before continuing  other
              actions. Higher values take extra steps to ensure data safety at the cost of slower performance. A
              value  of  0  will result in all handling being left to the filesystem itself. Set to -1 to select
              the default value according to database mode controlled by <b>DatabaseWriteAheadLogging</b> setting.  See
              SQLite documentation for more details regarding values from 1 to 3. Value range: -1..3

       <b>DatabaseWriteAheadLogging</b>
              Enable  or  disable SQLite Write-Ahead Logging mode for the database. See SQLite documentation for
              more details and note that support for  read-only  operations  isn't  available  in  older  SQLite
              versions. 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled.

       <b>HourlyDays</b>
              Data  retention  duration  for  the one hour resolution entries. The configuration defines for how
              many past days entries will be stored. Set to -1 for unlimited entries or to 0 to disable the data
              collection of this resolution.

       <b>LogFile</b>
              Specify log file path and name to be used if UseLogging is set to 1.

       <b>MaxBandwidth</b>
              Maximum bandwidth for all interfaces. If the interface specific traffic exceeds  the  given  value
              then  the  data  is assumed to be invalid and rejected.  Set to 0 in order to disable the feature.
              Value range: 0..50000

       <b>MaxBW</b>  Same as <b>MaxBandwidth</b> but can be used for setting individual limits for  selected  interfaces.  The
              name  of  the  interface is specified directly after the MaxBW keyword without spaces. For example
              MaxBWeth0 for eth0 and MaxBWppp0  for  ppp0.   <b>BandwidthDetection</b>  is  disabled  on  an  interface
              specific level for each <b>MaxBW</b> configuration. Value range: 0..50000

       <b>MonthlyMonths</b>
              Data  retention  duration  for the one month resolution entries. The configuration defines for how
              many past months entries will be stored. Set to -1 for unlimited entries or to 0  to  disable  the
              data collection of this resolution.

       <b>MonthRotate</b>
              Day  of  month  that months are expected to change. Usually set to 1 but can be set to alternative
              values for example for tracking monthly billed traffic where the billing period doesn't  start  on
              the  first  day. For example, if set to 7, days of February up to and including the 6th will count
              for January. Changing this option will not cause existing data to be  recalculated.  Value  range:
              1..28

       <b>MonthRotateAffectsYears</b>
              Enable  or  disable <b>MonthRotate</b> also affecting yearly data. Applicable only when <b>MonthRotate</b> has a
              value greater than one. 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled.

       <b>OfflineSaveInterval</b>
              How often in minutes cached interface data is saved to file  when  all  monitored  interfaces  are
              offline. Value range: <b>SaveInterval</b>..60

       <b>PidFile</b>
              Specify  pid file path and name to be used. The file is created only if the daemon is started as a
              background process.

       <b>PollInterval</b>
              How often in seconds interfaces are checked for status changes.  Value range: 2..60

       <b>RescanDatabaseOnSave</b>
              Automatically discover added interfaces from the database and start  monitoring.   The  rescan  is
              done every <b>SaveInterval</b> or <b>OfflineSaveInterval</b> minutes depending on the current activity state.  1
              = enabled, 0 = disabled.

       <b>SaveInterval</b>
              How  often  in minutes cached interface data is saved to file.  Value range: ( <b>UpdateInterval</b> / 60
              )..60

       <b>SaveOnStatusChange</b>
              Enable or disable the additional saving to file of cached interface data when the availability  of
              an  interface  changes,  i.e.,  when  an  interface goes offline or comes online. 1 = enabled, 0 =
              disabled.

       <b>TimeSyncWait</b>
              How many minutes to wait during daemon startup for system clock to sync if  most  recent  database
              update  appears to be in the future. This may be needed in systems without a real-time clock (RTC)
              which require some time after boot to query and set the correct time. 0 =  wait  disabled.   Value
              range: 0..60

       <b>TopDayEntries</b>
              Data  retention  duration  for the top day entries. The configuration defines how many of the past
              top day entries will be stored. Set to -1 for unlimited entries  or  to  0  to  disable  the  data
              collection of this resolution.

       <b>TrafficlessEntries</b>
              Create database entries even when there is no traffic during the entry's time period. 1 = enabled,
              0 = disabled.

       <b>UpdateFileOwner</b>
              Enable  or  disable  the  update  of  file ownership during daemon process startup.  During daemon
              startup, only database, log and pid files will be modified if the user or group change  feature  (
              <b>DaemonUser</b>  or  <b>DaemonGroup</b>  )  is  enabled and the files don't match the requested user or group.
              During manual database creation, this option will cause file ownership to be  inherited  from  the
              database  directory  if the directory already exists. This option only has effect when the process
              is started as root or via sudo.

       <b>UpdateInterval</b>
              How often in seconds the interface data is updated. Value range: <b>PollInterval</b>..300

       <b>UseLogging</b>
              Enable or disable logging. This option is ignored when the daemon is started with  <b>-n,</b>  <b>--nodaemon</b>
              which  results  in  all  log  output  being  shown  in  terminal the daemon process is using.  0 =
              disabled, 1 = logfile and 2 = syslog.

       <b>UseUTC</b> Enable or disable using UTC as timezone in the database for all entries. When enabled, all entries
              added to the database will use UTC regardless of the configured system  timezone.  When  disabled,
              the  configured  system  timezone  will  be used. Changing this setting will not result in already
              existing data to be modified. 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled.

       <b>VacuumOnHUPSignal</b>
              Enable or disable the execution of SQLite VACUUM command after  the  daemon  has  received  a  HUP
              signal.  When  enabled,  the  database  file is rebuilt and repacked into a minimal amount of disk
              space. The difference in size can be notable especially if  data  retention  durations  have  been
              reduced or previously monitored interfaces removed from the database.  1 = enabled, 0 = disabled.

       <b>VacuumOnStartup</b>
              Enable or disable the execution of SQLite VACUUM command during daemon startup.  When enabled, the
              database  file is rebuilt and repacked into a minimal amount of disk space. The difference in size
              can be notable especially if data retention durations have been reduced  or  previously  monitored
              interfaces removed from the database.  1 = enabled, 0 = disabled.

       <b>YearlyYears</b>
              Data  retention  duration  for  the one year resolution entries. The configuration defines for how
              many past years entries will be stored. Set to -1 for unlimited entries or to  0  to  disable  the
              data collection of this resolution.

       <b>5MinuteGraphResultCount</b>
              Number of 5 minute periods to be included in the 5 minute resolution graph.  The value affects the
              width of the graph. Value range: 288..2000

       <b>5MinuteGraphHeight</b>
              Height of 5 minute resolution graph in pixels. Value range: 150..2000

       <b>BarColumnShowsRate</b>
              The  bar  column  represents  traffic  rate  in  list  outputs  when  enabled.  Requires also that
              <b>OutputStyle</b> has been configured to show the traffic rate column by using the  value  3.   Enabling
              this  option  will  automatically  cause  <b>EstimateStyle</b>  to have the value 0. Visually this option
              affects only the color legend text and the last line on the  list  if  that  line  represents  the
              currently ongoing time period. 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled.
