</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fair.conf — configuration file for the carrousel and transponder daemons

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Debug</u> (bool, false)
               Runs the program in debug mode: it will not detach, it will print status updates very frequently,
               it will print extra diagnostic messages to stderr.

       <u>DropPrivs</u> (bool, true)
               The  program will switch to a different uid/gid after obtaining root-only resources. See also the
               UserID and GroupID variables.

       <u>WorkerService</u> (string, smtp) *
               This is the service on which the worker nodes offer the service that is being balanced. Typically
               this is the service of another daemon, e.g.  Postfix. The transponder daemon also  uses  this  as
               the datagram source service for its status updates.

       <u>BalancerService</u> (string, smtp) *
               The  stream  service  on  which  the  carrousel  daemon  listens  for incoming connections. These
               connections will be put through to one of the worker nodes.

       <u>TransponderService</u> (string, rlp) *
               The carrousel daemon listens on this service for status update datagrams from  the  transponders.
               See also the AllowUDP variable.

       <u>PingInterval</u> (time, 0.1 seconds)
               How often the transponder sends an update to each carrousel. So, if two carrousels are configured
               and the interval is 0.1 seconds, that transponder sends 20 packets every second.

       <u>PingTimeout</u> (time, 0.5 seconds)
               After  this  period has elapsed without receiving any status update packets from the transponder,
               this host is considered dead.

       <u>IdleTimeout</u> (time, 600.0 seconds)
               The connection is terminated if neither party has sent something for this many seconds. For  SMTP
               connections this would have to be at least 600.0 seconds, see RFC 2821 section 4.5.3.2.

       <u>ConnectTimeout</u> (time, 1.0 seconds)
               When connecting to a worker node, abort after this many seconds have elapsed and no connection is
               established.

       <u>ConnectAttempts</u> (integer, 3)
               When  putting  through  a  connection  fails,  the carrousel will attempt to contact other worker
               nodes. It will give up after this many tries.

       <u>BenchPeriod</u> (time, 5.0 seconds)
               If a connection to a worker node fails it is excluded from new connections for this many seconds.

       <u>TrailPeriod</u> (time, 60.0 seconds)
               When a connection is finished, pretend it lasted this many  seconds  more  for  load  calculation
               purposes.

       <u>Hysteresis</u> (integer, 0)
               Add an advantage to the last used worker node so that it gets selected in preference of others.

       <u>MaxCapacity</u> (integer, 100)
               When  sending  update  packets,  the  capacity of the worker node measured in terms of concurrent
               connections. This number is adjusted for the current  load  average  before  sending  it  to  the
               carrousel nodes.

       <u>MaxBurst</u> (integer, 65536)
               Ringbuffer size for load balancer nodes.

       <u>MinBurst</u> (integer, 1450)
               If  fewer  than this many bytes are available in the ring buffer, do not read anything but try to
               free up space first.

       <u>LocalTCP</u> (bool, yes)
               Only allow connections over the loopback interface. If this option is set  to  "no",  connections
               will be accepted on any interface and on any address.

       <u>AllowUDP</u> (extended regexp, ^)
               Only  datagram status packets that match this extended regular expression are accepted. All other
               datagram packets are logged and silently dropped.  Once UDP packets are accepted from  a  certain
               source, they are never matched against this regexp again.
