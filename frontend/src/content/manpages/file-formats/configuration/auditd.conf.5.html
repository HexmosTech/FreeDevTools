       auditd.conf - audit daemon configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  file  <u>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</u>  contains  configuration information specific to the audit daemon. Each
       line should contain  one  configuration  keyword,  an  equal  sign,  and  then  followed  by  appropriate
       configuration  information. All option names and values are case insensitive. The keywords recognized are
       listed and described below. Each line should be limited to 160 characters or the line  will  be  skipped.
       You may add comments to the file by starting the line with a '#' character.

       <u>local_events</u>
              This  yes/no  keyword  specifies  whether  or not to include local events. Normally you want local
              events so the default value is yes. Cases where you would set this to  no  is  when  you  want  to
              aggregate  events  only  from  the  network.  At the moment, this is useful if the audit daemon is
              running in a container. This option can only be set once at daemon start up. Reloading the  config
              file has no effect.

       <u>log_file</u>
              This  keyword  specifies the full path name to the log file where audit records will be stored. It
              must be a regular file. The default path is <u>/var/log/audit/audit.log</u> if not explicitly set.

       <u>write_logs</u>
              This yes/no keyword determines whether or not to write logs to the disk.  Normally you  want  this
              so the default is yes.

       <u>log_format</u>
              The  log  format  describes how the information should be stored on disk. There are 2 options: raw
              and enriched. If set to <u>RAW</u>, the audit records will be stored in a format exactly  as  the  kernel
              sends it. The <u>ENRICHED</u> option will resolve all uid, gid, syscall, architecture, and socket address
              information  before  writing the event to disk. This aids in making sense of events created on one
              system but reported/analyzed on another system.  The <u>NOLOG</u> option is now deprecated. If  you  were
              setting this format, now you should set the write_logs option to no.

       <u>log_group</u>
              This  keyword  specifies  the  group that is applied to the log file's permissions. The default is
              root. The group name can be either numeric or spelled out.

       <u>priority_boost</u>
              This is a non-negative number that tells the audit daemon how much of a priority boost  it  should
              take. The default is 4. No change is 0.

       <u>flush</u>  Valid  values  are  <u>none</u>,  <u>incremental</u>,  <u>incremental_async</u>,  <u>data</u>,   and <u>sync</u>.  If set to <u>none</u>, no
              special effort is made to flush the audit records to disk. If set to <u>incremental</u>,  Then  the  <u>freq</u>
              parameter   is   used  to  determine  how  often  an  explicit  flush  to  disk  is  issued.   The
              <u>incremental_async</u>  parameter  is  very  much  like  <u>incremental</u>  except  the  flushing   is   done
              asynchronously  for higher performance. The <u>data</u> parameter tells the audit daemon to keep the data
              portion of the disk file sync'd at all times. The <u>sync</u> option tells the audit daemon to keep  both
              the   data   and  meta-data  fully  sync'd  with  every  write  to  disk.  The  default  value  is
              incremental_async.

       <u>freq</u>   This is a non-negative number that tells the audit daemon how many records to write before issuing
              an explicit flush to disk command. This value is only valid when  the  <u>flush</u>  keyword  is  set  to
              <u>incremental</u> or incremental_async.

       <u>num_logs</u>
              This   keyword   specifies   the  number  of  log  files  to  keep  if  rotate  is  given  as  the
              <u>max_log_file_action.</u>  If the number is &lt; 2, logs are not rotated. This number must be 999 or less.
              The default is 0 - which means no rotation. As you increase the number of log files being rotated,
              you may need to adjust the kernel backlog setting upwards since it takes more time to  rotate  the
              files.  This  is typically done in /etc/audit/audit.rules. If log rotation is configured to occur,
              the daemon will check for excess logs and remove them in effort to keep disk space available.  The
              excess log check is only done on startup and when a reconfigure results in a space check.

       <u>name_format</u>
              This  option controls how computer node names are inserted into the audit event stream. It has the
              following choices: <u>none</u>, <u>hostname</u>, <u>fqd</u>, <u>numeric</u>, and <u>user</u>.  <u>None</u> means that no  computer  name  is
              inserted  into the audit event.  <u>hostname</u> is the name returned by the gethostname syscall. The <u>fqd</u>
              means that it takes the hostname and resolves it with dns for a fully  qualified  domain  name  of
              that  machine.   <u>Numeric</u>  is  similar  to fqd except it resolves the IP address of the machine. In
              order to use this option, you might want to test that 'hostname -i' or 'domainname -i'  returns  a
              numeric  address.  Also,  this  option  is  not recommended if dhcp is used because you could have
              different addresses over time for the same machine.  <u>User</u> is an admin defined string from the name
              option. The default value is <u>none</u>.

       <u>name</u>   This is the admin defined string that identifies the machine if <u>user</u> is given as  the  <u>name_format</u>
              option.

       <u>max_log_file</u>
              This  keyword  specifies  the  maximum file size in megabytes. When this limit is reached, it will
              trigger a configurable action. The value given must be numeric.

       <u>max_log_file_action</u>
              This parameter tells the system what action to take when the system has detected that the max file
              size limit has been reached. Valid values are <u>ignore</u>, <u>syslog</u>, <u>suspend</u>, <u>rotate</u> and  <u>keep_logs.</u>   If
              set  to  <u>ignore</u>,  the  audit  daemon  does  nothing.  <u>syslog</u> means that it will issue a warning to
              syslog.  <u>suspend</u> will cause the audit daemon to stop writing records to the disk. The daemon  will
              still  be  alive.  The  <u>rotate</u> option will cause the audit daemon to rotate the logs. It should be
              noted that logs with higher numbers are older than logs with  lower  numbers.  This  is  the  same
              convention used by the logrotate utility. The <u>keep_logs</u> option is similar to rotate except it does
              not  use the num_logs setting. This prevents audit logs from being overwritten. The effect is that
              logs accumulate and are not deleted - which will trigger the <u>space_left_action</u> if the volume fills
              up. This is best used in combination with an external script used to archive logs  on  a  periodic
              basis.

       <u>verify_email</u>
              This  option  determines  if  the email address given in <u>action_mail_acct</u> is checked to see if the
              domain name can be resolved. This option must be given  before  <u>action_mail_acct</u>  or  the  default
              value of yes will be used.

       <u>action_mail_acct</u>
              This  option  should  contain  a  valid  email  address or alias. Addresses may use RFC 5233 style
              subaddressing with the '+' character. The allowed characters are  alphanumerics,  '@',  '.',  '-',
              '_',  and  '+'. The default address is root. If the email address is not local to the machine, you
              must make sure you have email properly configured on your machine and network.  This  this  option
              requires that /usr/lib/sendmail exists on the machine. Many clients provide it as a symlink.

       <u>space_left</u>
              If  the  free space in the filesystem containing <u>log_file</u> drops below this value, the audit daemon
              takes the action specified by <u>space_left_action</u>.  If the value of <u>space_left</u>  is  specified  as  a
              whole number, it is interpreted as an absolute size in megabytes (MiB).  If the value is specified
              as a number between 1 and 99 followed by a percentage sign (e.g., 5%), the audit daemon calculates
              the absolute size in megabytes based on the size of the filesystem containing <u>log_file</u>.  (E.g., if
              the  filesystem containing <u>log_file</u> is 2 gigabytes in size, and <u>space_left</u> is set to 25%, then the
              audit daemon sets <u>space_left</u> to approximately  500  megabytes.   Note  that  this  calculation  is
              performed  when the audit daemon starts, so if you resize the filesystem containing <u>log_file</u> while
              the audit daemon is running, you should send the audit daemon SIGHUP to re-read the  configuration
              file and recalculate the correct percentage.

       <u>space_left_action</u>
              This  parameter  tells  the  system  what  action  to take when the system has detected that it is
              starting to get low on disk space.  Valid values are <u>ignore</u>, <u>syslog</u>, <u>rotate</u>, <u>email</u>, <u>exec</u>, <u>suspend</u>,
              and <u>single</u>.  If set to <u>ignore</u>, the audit daemon does nothing.  <u>syslog</u> means that it will  issue  a
              warning to syslog.  <u>rotate</u> will rotate logs, losing the oldest to free up space.  <u>Email</u> means that
              it  will  send a warning to the email account specified in <u>action_mail_acct</u> as well as sending the
              message to syslog.  <u>exec</u> /path-to-script will execute the script. You cannot  pass  parameters  to
              the  script.  The  script is also responsible for telling the auditd daemon to resume logging once
              its completed its action. This can be done by adding service auditd resume to the script.  <u>suspend</u>
              will cause the audit daemon to stop writing records to the disk. The daemon will still  be  alive.
              The  <u>single</u>  option  will  cause  the audit daemon to put the computer system in single user mode.
              Except for rotate, it will perform this action  just  one  time.  The  previously  available  <u>halt</u>
              option,  which  would cause the audit daemon to shut down the computer system, has been deprecated
              and should no longer be used. It was determined that halting the system at this stage  could  lead
              to unintended consequences and is considered a bad action if selected.

              Disk  space notifications follow a three-stage progression. The <u>space_left_action</u> is the low water
              mark and serves as the first warning that disk space is running low. Halting at this stage is  not
              recommended,  as  it  prevents  administrators  from  taking  corrective  action.  The next stage,
              <u>admin_space_left_action,</u> indicates an emergency level where immediate action is required  to  free
              up  disk  space.  Administrators  should configure critical responses for this level. Finally, the
              <u>disk_full_action</u> occurs when the disk is completely full. At  this  stage,  the  system  may  have
              already  halted,  and preemptive measures configured in earlier stages will determine the system’s
              behavior.

       <u>admin_space_left</u>
              This is a numeric value in megabytes that tells the audit daemon when to  perform  a  configurable
              action  because the system <b>is</b> <b>running</b> <b>low</b> on disk space. This should be considered the last chance
              to do something before running out of disk space. The numeric value for this parameter  should  be
              lower  than  the number for space_left. You may also append a percent sign (e.g. 1%) to the number
              to have the audit daemon calculate the number based on the disk partition size.

       <u>admin_space_left_action</u>
              This parameter tells the system what action to take when the system has detected that it <b>is</b> <b>low</b> <b>on</b>
              <b>disk</b> <b>space.</b>  Valid values are <u>ignore</u>, <u>syslog</u>, <u>rotate</u>, <u>email</u>, <u>exec</u>, <u>suspend</u>, <u>single</u>, and <u>halt</u>.   If
              set  to  <u>ignore</u>,  the  audit  daemon  does  nothing.  <u>Syslog</u> means that it will issue a warning to
              syslog.  <u>rotate</u> will rotate logs, losing the oldest to free up space.  <u>Email</u> means  that  it  will
              send  a  warning to the email account specified in <u>action_mail_acct</u> as well as sending the message
              to syslog.  <u>exec</u> /path-to-script will execute the  script.  You  cannot  pass  parameters  to  the
              script.  The  script  is also responsible for telling the auditd daemon to resume logging once its
              completed its action. This can be done by adding service auditd resume  to  the  script.   <u>Suspend</u>
              will  cause  the audit daemon to stop writing records to the disk. The daemon will still be alive.
              The <u>single</u> option will cause the audit daemon to put the computer system in single user mode.  The
              <u>halt</u>  option  will  cause  the audit daemon to shutdown the computer system. Except for rotate, it
              will perform this action just one time.

       <u>disk_full_action</u>
              This parameter tells the system what action  to  take  when  the  system  has  detected  that  the
              partition to which log files are written has become full. Valid values are <u>ignore</u>, <u>syslog</u>, <u>rotate</u>,
              <u>exec</u>,  <u>suspend</u>,  <u>single</u>, and <u>halt</u>.  If set to <u>ignore</u>, the audit daemon will issue a syslog message
              but no other action is taken.  <u>Syslog</u> means that it will issue a warning to syslog.   <u>rotate</u>  will
              rotate  logs,  losing  the oldest to free up space.  <u>exec</u> /path-to-script will execute the script.
              You cannot pass parameters to the script. The script is also responsible for  telling  the  auditd
              daemon  to  resume  logging  g  once  its completed its action. This can be done by adding service
              auditd resume to the script.  <u>Suspend</u> will cause the audit daemon to stop writing records  to  the
              disk.  The  daemon  will  still be alive. The <u>single</u> option will cause the audit daemon to put the
              computer system in single user mode.  <u>halt</u> option will cause the  audit  daemon  to  shutdown  the
              computer system.

       <u>disk_error_action</u>
              This  parameter  tells  the  system  what  action to take whenever there is an error detected when
              writing audit events to disk or rotating logs. Valid values are  <u>ignore</u>,  <u>syslog</u>,  <u>exec</u>,  <u>suspend</u>,
              <u>single</u>, and <u>halt</u>.  If set to <u>ignore</u>, the audit daemon will not take any action.  <u>Syslog</u> means that
              it  will  issue  no more than 5 consecutive warnings to syslog.  <u>exec</u> /path-to-script will execute
              the script. You cannot pass parameters to the script.  <u>Suspend</u> will cause the audit daemon to stop
              writing records to the disk. The daemon will still be alive. The  <u>single</u>  option  will  cause  the
              audit  daemon  to  put  the computer system in single user mode.  <u>halt</u> option will cause the audit
              daemon to shutdown the computer system.

       <u>tcp_listen_port</u>
              This is a numeric value in the range 1..65535 which, if specified, causes auditd to listen on  the
              corresponding  TCP port for audit records from remote systems. The audit daemon may be linked with
              tcp_wrappers. You may want to control access with an entry in the hosts.allow and deny  files.  If
              this is deployed on a systemd based OS, then you may need to adjust the 'After' directive. See the
              note in the auditd.service file.

       <u>tcp_listen_queue</u>
              This  is  a  numeric value which indicates how many pending (requested but unaccepted) connections
              are allowed.  The default is 5.  Setting this too small may cause connections to  be  rejected  if
              too  many  hosts start up at exactly the same time, such as after a power failure. This setting is
              only used for aggregating servers. Clients logging to a remote server should keep  this  commented
              out.

       <u>tcp_max_per_addr</u>
              This  is  a  numeric  value which indicates how many concurrent connections from one IP address is
              allowed.  The default is 1 and the maximum is 1024. Setting this too large may allow for a  Denial
              of  Service  attack  on the logging server. Also note that the kernel has an internal maximum that
              will eventually prevent this even if auditd allows it by config. The default should be adequate in
              most cases unless a custom written recovery script runs to forward unsent events. In this case you
              would increase the number only large enough to let it in too.

       <u>use_libwrap</u>
              This setting determines whether or not to use tcp_wrappers to discern connection attempts that are
              from allowed machines. Legal values are either <u>yes</u>, or <u>no</u> The default value is yes.

       <u>tcp_client_ports</u>
              This parameter may be a single numeric value  or  two  values  separated  by  a  dash  (no  spaces
              allowed).   It  indicates  which  client  ports  are  allowed  for  incoming  connections.  If not
              specified, any port is allowed.  Allowed values are 1..65535.  For example, to require the  client
              use a privileged port, specify <u>1-1023</u> for this parameter. You will also need to set the local_port
              option  in  the audisp-remote.conf file. Making sure that clients send from a privileged port is a
              security feature to prevent log injection attacks by untrusted users.

       <u>tcp_client_max_idle</u>
              This parameter indicates the number of seconds that a client may be idle (i.e. no data  from  them
              at  all) before auditd complains. This is used to close inactive connections if the client machine
              has a problem where it cannot shutdown the connection cleanly. Note that this is a global setting,
              and must be higher than any individual client heartbeat_timeout setting, preferably by a factor of
              two.  The default is zero, which disables this check.

       <u>transport</u>
              If set to <u>TCP</u>, only clear text tcp connections will be used. If set to <u>KRB5</u>, then Kerberos 5  will
              be used for authentication and encryption. The default value is TCP.

       <u>enable_krb5</u>
              This  option  is  deprecated.  Use the <u>transport</u> option above instead. If set to "yes", Kerberos 5
              will be used for authentication and encryption.  The default is "no". If this  option  is  set  to
              "yes"  and  it follows the transport option, it will override the transport setting. This would be
              the normal expected behavior for backwards compatibility.

       <u>krb5_principal</u>
              This is the principal for this server.  The default is "auditd".  Given this default,  the  server
              will  look  for  a  key  named  like <u>auditd/<a href="mailto:hostname@EXAMPLE.COM">hostname@EXAMPLE.COM</a></u> stored in <u>/etc/audit/audit.key</u> to
              authenticate itself, where hostname is the canonical name for the server's host, as returned by  a
              DNS lookup of its IP address.

       <u>krb5_key_file</u>
              Location of the key for this client's principal.  Note that the key file must be owned by root and
              mode 0400.  The default is <u>/etc/audit/audit.key</u>

       <u>distribute_network</u>
              If  set  to  "yes",  network  originating  events  will be distributed to the audit dispatcher for
              processing. The default is "no".

       <u>q_depth</u>
              This is a numeric value that tells how  big  to  make  the  internal  queue  of  the  audit  event
              dispatcher. A bigger queue lets it handle a flood of events better, but could hold events that are
              not  processed  when  the daemon is terminated. If you get messages in syslog about events getting
              dropped, increase this value. The default value is 2000.

       <u>overflow_action</u>
              This option determines how the daemon should react to overflowing its internal  queue.  When  this
              happens,  it  means that more events are being received than it can pass along to child processes.
              This error means that it is going to lose the current event that it's  trying  to  dispatch.  This
              option  has  the  following choices: <u>ignore</u>, <u>syslog</u>, <u>suspend</u>, <u>single</u>, and <u>halt</u>.  If set to <u>ignore</u>,
              the audit daemon does nothing.  <u>syslog</u> means that it will issue a warning to syslog.  <u>suspend</u> will
              cause the audit daemon to stop sending events to child processes. The daemon will still be  alive.
              The  <u>single</u>  option  will  cause  the audit daemon to put the computer system in single user mode.
              <u>halt</u> option will cause the audit daemon to shutdown the computer system.

       <u>max_restarts</u>
              This is a non-negative number that tells the audit event dispatcher how many times it can  try  to
              restart a crashed plugin. The default is 10.

       <u>plugin_dir</u>
              This  is  the  location  that  auditd  will  use to search for its plugin configuration files. The
              default directory is <u>/etc/audit/plugins.d</u>

       <u>end_of_event_timeout</u>
              This is a non-negative number of seconds used by the userspace <u>auparse()</u> library routines and  the
              <u><a href="../man8/aureport.8.html">aureport</a>(8)</u>  ,  <u><a href="../man8/ausearch.8.html">ausearch</a>(8)</u>  utilities  to consider an event is complete when parsing an event log
              stream. For an  event  stream  being  processed,  if  the  time  of  the  current  event  is  over
              <u>end_of_event_timeout</u>  seconds  old,  compared  to  co-located events, then the event is considered
              complete. The default is 2 seconds. See the NOTES section for more detail.

       <u>report_interval</u>
              This option specifies the interval between automatic state reports. The value  is  a  time  string
              composed  of  a  number  optionally  followed  by <b>m</b> for minutes, <b>h</b> for hours, <b>d</b> for days, or <b>M</b> for
              months.  The default is 0 which disables preriodic reporting. The largest value is 40  days.  When
              set, auditd will periodically generate the state report written to <u>/var/run/auditd.state.</u>

</pre><h4><b>RELOADING</b></h4><pre>
       Most parameters can be changed while the daemon is running by sending <b>SIGHUP</b> to <b>auditd</b>.  This can also be
       done  with  <b>auditctl</b> <b>--signal</b> <b>reload</b>.   Options  that  are  only read at startup include <u>local_events</u> and
       <u>verify_email</u>

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       In a CAPP environment, the audit trail is considered so important that access to system resources must be
       denied if  an  audit  trail  cannot  be  created.  In  this  environment,  it  would  be  suggested  that
       /var/log/audit  be  on  its own partition. This is to ensure that space detection is accurate and that no
       other process comes along and consumes part of it.

       The flush parameter should be set to sync or data.

       Max_log_file and num_logs need to be adjusted so that you get complete use of your partition.  It  should
       be  noted that the more files that have to be rotated, the longer it takes to get back to receiving audit
       events. Max_log_file_action should be set to keep_logs.

       Space_left should be set to a number that gives the admin enough time to react to any alert  message  and
       perform  some  maintenance  to  free  up disk space. This would typically involve running the <b>aureport</b> <b>-t</b>
       report and moving the oldest logs to an archive area. The value of space_left is site dependent since the
       rate at which events are generated varies with each deployment. The space_left_action is  recommended  to
       be set to email. If you need something like an snmp trap, you can use the exec option to send one.

       Admin_space_left  should  be  set  to  the  amount  of disk space on the audit partition needed for admin
       actions to be recorded. Admin_space_left_action would be set to single so that  use  of  the  machine  is
       restricted to just the console.

       The  disk_full_action  is  triggered  when  no  more  room  exists on the partition. All access should be
       terminated since no more audit capability exists. This can be set to either single or halt.

       The disk_error_action should be set to syslog, single, or halt depending on your local policies regarding
       handling of hardware malfunctions.

       Specifying a single allowed client port may make it difficult for  the  client  to  restart  their  audit
       subsystem, as it will be unable to recreate a connection with the same host addresses and ports until the
       connection closure TIME_WAIT state times out.

       Auditd  events  are  made  up  of one or more records. The auditd system cannot guarantee that the set of
       records that make up an event will occur atomically, that is the stream will have interleaved records  of
       different events, IE

              event0_record0
              event1_record0
              event2_record0
              event1_record3
              event2_record1
              event1_record4
              event3_record0

       The  auditd  system does not guarantee that the records that make up an event will appear in order. Thus,
       when processing event streams, we need to maintain a list of events with their own list of records  hence
       List of List (LOL) event processing.

       When processing an event stream we define the end of an event via

              record type = AUDIT_EOE (audit end of event type record), or
              record type = AUDIT_PROCTITLE (we note the AUDIT_PROCTITLE is always the last record), or
              record type = AUDIT_KERNEL (kernel events are one record events), or
              record type &lt; AUDIT_FIRST_EVENT (only single record events appear before this type), or
              record type &gt;= AUDIT_FIRST_ANOM_MSG (only single record events appear after this type), or
              record  type  &gt;= AUDIT_MAC_UNLBL_ALLOW &amp;&amp; record type &lt;= AUDIT_MAC_CALIPSO_DEL (these are also one
              record events), or
              for the stream being processed, the time of the event is over end_of_event_timeout seconds old.

</pre><h4><b>LOG</b> <b>ROTATION</b> <b>POLICY</b></h4><pre>
       By default, auditd uses size-based log rotation. If you prefer time-based rotation (e.g., hourly,  daily,
       weekly, or custom schedule), refer to <a href="../man5/auditd.cron.5.html">auditd.cron</a>(5) for configuration details.
