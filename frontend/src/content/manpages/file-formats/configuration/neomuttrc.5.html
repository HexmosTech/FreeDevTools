</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       neomuttrc - Configuration file for the NeoMutt Mail User Agent (MUA)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A NeoMutt configuration file consists of a series of “commands”. Each line of the file may contain one or
       more commands. When multiple commands are used, they must be separated by a semicolon (“<b>;</b>”).

       The  hash  mark,  or  pound sign (“<b>#</b>”), is used as a “comment” character. You can use it to annotate your
       initialization file. All text after the comment character to the end of the line is ignored.

       Single quotes (“<b>'</b>”) and double quotes (“<b>"</b>”) can be used to quote strings which contain  spaces  or  other
       special  characters.  The  difference  between the two types of quotes is similar to that of many popular
       shell programs, namely that a single quote is  used  to  specify  a  literal  string  (one  that  is  not
       interpreted  for  shell  variables or quoting with a backslash [see next paragraph]), while double quotes
       indicate a string which should be evaluated. For  example,  backticks  are  evaluated  inside  of  double
       quotes, but not single quotes.

       “<b>\</b>”  quotes  the  next character, just as in shells such as Bash and Zsh. For example, if you want to put
       quotes (“<b>"</b>”) inside of a string, you can use “<b>\</b>” to force the next character to be a literal  instead  of
       interpreted character.

       “<b>\\</b>”  means to insert a literal “<b>\</b>” into the line. “<b>\n</b>” and “<b>\r</b>” have their usual C meanings of line feed
       (LF) and carriage return (CR), respectively.

       A “<b>\</b>” at the end of a line can be used to split commands over multiple lines,  provided  that  the  split
       points don't appear in the middle of command names.

       It  is  also  possible  to  substitute  the  output  of a Unix command in an initialization file. This is
       accomplished by enclosing the command in backticks (<b>`</b><u>command</u><b>`</b>).

       Unix environment variables can be accessed like the way it is done in shells like sh  and  Bash:  Prepend
       the name of the variable by a dollar (“<b>$</b>”) sign.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Configuration</b> <b>Commands</b>
       The following are the commands understood by NeoMutt:

       <b>account-hook</b> <u>regex</u> <u>command</u>

              This  hook  is  executed  whenever  you  access  a  remote mailbox. Useful to adjust configuration
              settings to different IMAP or POP servers.

       <b>alias</b> [ <b>-group</b> <u>name</u> ... ] <u>key</u> <u>address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>address</u> ... ]
       <b>unalias</b> [ <b>-group</b> <u>name</u> ... ] { <b>*</b> | <u>key</u> ... }

              <b>alias</b> defines a surrogate <u>key</u> for the given address(es). Each <u>address</u> will be resolved into either
              an email address (<a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a>) or a named email address (User Name &lt;<a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a>&gt;).   The
              address may be specified in either format, or in the format “<a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a> (User Name)”.

              <b>Note</b>:  If  you  want to create an alias for more than one address, you <b>must</b> separate the addresses
              with a comma (“<b>,</b>”).

              <b>unalias</b> removes the alias corresponding to the given <u>key</u> or all aliases when “<b>*</b>”  is  used  as  an
              argument.

              The optional <b>-group</b> flag causes the address(es) to be added to or removed from the <u>name</u>d group.

       <b>alternates</b> [ <b>-group</b> <u>name</u> ... ] <u>regex</u> [ <u>regex</u> ... ]
       <b>unalternates</b> [ <b>-group</b> <u>name</u> ... ] { <b>*</b> | <u>regex</u> ... }

              <b>alternates</b> is used to inform NeoMutt about alternate addresses where you receive mail; you can use
              regular  expressions  (<u>regex</u>)  to  specify  alternate addresses. This affects NeoMutt's idea about
              messages from you, and messages addressed to you.

              <b>unalternates</b> can be used to write exceptions to alternates regular expression. To remove a regular
              expression from the alternates list, use the unalternates command with exactly the same  <u>regex</u>  or
              use “<b>*</b>” to remove all entries.

              The  optional  <b>-group</b>  flag  causes  all  of  the subsequent regular expressions to be added to or
              removed from the <u>name</u>d group.

       <b>alternative_order</b> <u>mime-type</u>[/<u>mime-subtype</u>] [ <u>mime-type</u>[/<u>mime-subtype</u>] ... ]
       <b>unalternative_order</b> { <b>*</b> | <u>mime-type</u>[/<u>mime-subtype</u>] ... }

              <b>alternative_order</b> command permits you to define an order of preference that is used by NeoMutt  to
              determine which part of a <b>multipart/alternative</b> body to display. A <u>mime-subtype</u> of “<b>*</b>” matches any
              <b>multipart/alternative</b> subtype, as does an empty <u>mime-subtype</u>.

              <b>unalternative_order</b>  removes  entries from the ordered list or deletes the entire list when “<b>*</b>” is
              used as an argument.

       <b>attachments</b> { <b>+</b> | <b>-</b> }<u>disposition</u> <u>mime-type</u> [ <u>mime-type</u> ... ]
       <b>unattachments</b> { <b>+</b> | <b>-</b> }<u>disposition</u> <u>mime-type</u> [ <u>mime-type</u> ... ]
       <b>attachments</b> <b>?</b>
       <b>unattachments</b> <b>*</b>

              You can make your message index display the number of qualifying attachments in each  message,  or
              search  for messages by attachment count. You also can configure what kinds of attachments qualify
              for this feature with the <b>attachments</b> and <b>unattachments</b> commands.

              <u>disposition</u> is the attachment's Content-Disposition type — either <b>inline</b> or  <b>attachment</b>.  You  can
              abbreviate this to <b>I</b> or <b>A</b>.

              Disposition  is  prefixed  by either a <b>+</b> symbol or a <b>-</b> symbol. If it's a <b>+</b>, you're saying that you
              want to allow this disposition and MIME type to qualify. If it's a  <b>-</b>,  you're  saying  that  this
              disposition and MIME type is an exception to previous <b>+</b> rules.

              <u>mime-type</u> is the MIME type of the attachment you want the command to affect. A MIME type is always
              of  the format <b>major/minor</b>. The major part of <u>mime-type</u> must be literal text (or the special token
              “<b>*</b>”, but the minor part may be a regular expression. Therefore, “<b>*<a href="file:/.">/.</a>*</b>”  matches any MIME type.

              Note that the first MIME part is treated slightly differently: It is  almost  always  the  message
              text.   Thus,  it  is  not  counted  as an attachment if its disposition is <b>inline</b> and it is not a
              <b>multipart/*</b> or <b>message/*</b> MIME-type.

              Entering the command “<b>attachments</b> <b>?</b>” as a command will list your  current  settings  in  neomuttrc
              format, so that it can be pasted elsewhere.

              Entering the command “<b>unattachments</b> <b>*</b>” as a command will Clear all attachment settings.

       <b>auto_view</b> <u>mime-type</u>[<b>/</b><u>mime-subtype</u>] [ <u>mime-type</u>[<b>/</b><u>mime-subtype</u>] ... ]
       <b>unauto_view</b> { <b>*</b> | <u>mime-type</u>[<b>/</b><u>mime-subtype</u>] ... }

              This  commands  permits  you  to specify that NeoMutt should automatically convert the given <u>mime-</u>
              <u>type</u>s to text/plain when displaying messages. For this to work, there must be a  <b><a href="../man5/mailcap.5.html">mailcap</a></b>(5)  entry
              for  the  given  <u>mime-type</u>  with  the <b>copiousoutput</b> option set.  A <u>mime-subtype</u> of “<b>*</b>” matches any
              <b>multipart/alternative</b> subtype, as does an empty <u>mime-subtype</u>.

       <b>bind</b> <u>map</u>[<b>,</b><u>map</u> ... ] <u>key</u> <u>function</u>
       <b>unbind</b> { <b>*</b> | <u>map</u> | [<b>,</b><u>map</u>...]} [ <u>key</u> ]

              This command allows you to change the default or define additional key bindings (operation invoked
              when pressing a key).

              <u>map</u> specifies in which menu the binding belongs. Multiple <u>map</u>s may be specified by separating them
              with commas (no additional whitespace is allowed). The currently defined <u>map</u>s are: <b>alias</b>,  <b>attach</b>,
              <b>browser</b>, <b>compose</b>, <b>editor</b>, <b>generic</b>, <b>index</b>, <b>mix</b>, <b>pager</b>, <b>pgp</b>, <b>postpone</b>, <b>query</b> and <b>smime</b>.

              <u>key</u> is the key (or key sequence) you wish to bind, e.g.  “<b>\Ca</b>” for control-A. In addition, <u>key</u> may
              be  specified  as a three digit octal number prefixed with a “<b>\</b>” or as a symbolic name. The <b>&lt;what-</b>
              <b>key&gt;</b> function can be used to explore keycode and symbolic names for the keys on your keyboard.

              <u>function</u> specifies which action to take when key is pressed. Note that the function name is to  be
              specified without angle brackets.

              Missing key sequence in <b>unbind</b> command means unbind all bindings in menus given in <u>map</u> .

              For more information on keys and functions, please consult the NeoMutt manual.

       <b>charset-hook</b> <u>alias</u> <u>charset</u>
       <b>iconv-hook</b> <u>charset</u> <u>local-charset</u>

              <b>charset-hook</b>  defines  an  <u>alias</u>  for a character set. This is useful to properly display messages
              which are tagged with a character set name not known to NeoMutt.

              <b>iconv-hook</b> defines a system-specific name for a character set. This is useful when  your  system's
              <b><a href="../man3/iconv.3.html">iconv</a></b>(3)  implementation  does  not  understand MIME character set names (such as <b>iso-8859-1</b>), but
              instead insists on being fed with implementation-specific character set names (such as <b>8859-1</b>). In
              this specific case, you'd put “<b>iconv-hook</b> iso-8859-1 8859-1” into your configuration file.

       <b>color</b> <u>object</u> [ <u>attribute</u> ... ] <u>foreground</u> <u>background</u>
       <b>color</b> { header | body } [ <u>attribute</u> ... ] <u>foreground</u> <u>background</u> <u>regex</u>
       <b>color</b> status <u>foreground</u> <u>background</u> [<u>regex</u> [ <u>num</u> ]]
       <b>color</b> index-object [ <u>attribute</u> ... ] <u>foreground</u> <u>background</u> <u>pattern</u>
       <b>color</b> <u>compose-object</u> <u>foreground</u> <u>background</u>
       <b>color</b> <u>compose-object</u> [ <u>attribute</u> ... ] <u>foreground</u> <u>background</u>
       <b>uncolor</b> { index-object | header | body } { <b>*</b> | <u>pattern</u> ... }

              If your terminal supports color, these  commands  can  be  used  to  assign  <u>foreground</u>/<u>background</u>
              combinations  to  certain  <u>object</u>s. The currently defined <u>object</u>s are: <b>attach_headers</b>, <b>attachment</b>,
              <b>body</b>, <b>bold</b>, <b>error</b>, <b>hdrdefault</b>, <b>header</b>, <b>index</b>, <b>index_author</b>,  <b>index_collapsed</b>,  <b>index_date</b>,  <b>index_</b>
              <b>flags</b>,  <b>index_label</b>,  <b>index_number</b>,  <b>index_size</b>,  <b>index_subject</b>, <b>index_tag</b>, <b>index_tags</b>, <b>indicator</b>,
              <b>markers</b>,  <b>message</b>,  <b>normal</b>,  <b>progress</b>,  <b>prompt</b>,  <b>quoted</b>,  <b>quoted</b><u>N</u>,  <b>search</b>,   <b>signature</b>,   <b>status</b>,
              <b>stripe_even</b>, <b>stripe_odd</b>, <b>tilde</b>, <b>tree</b>, <b>underline</b>.

              If  the  sidebar  is  enabled  the  following <u>object</u>s are also valid: <b>sidebar_background</b>, <b>sidebar_</b>
              <b>divider</b>, <b>sidebar_flagged</b>,  <b>sidebar_highlight</b>,  <b>sidebar_indicator</b>,  <b>sidebar_new</b>,  <b>sidebar_ordinary</b>,
              <b>sidebar_spool_file</b>.

              The  <b>body</b>  and  <b>header</b> objects allow you to restrict the colorization to a regular expression. The
              <b>index-object</b> permits you to select colored messages by pattern.

              The <b>header</b> and <b>body</b> match <u>regex</u> in the header/body of a message, <b>index-object</b> can match <u>pattern</u> in
              the message index.  Note that IMAP server-side searches (=b, =B, =h) are not supported  for  color
              index patterns.

              The  <b>status</b>  object optionally takes an regex and a match number.  If the regex is given, only the
              matching parts are colored.  If additionally the match number is given, only that sub-match of the
              regex is colored.

              Valid compose-objects  include  <b>compose_header</b>,  <b>compose_security_encrypt</b>,  <b>compose_security_sign</b>,
              <b>compose_security_both</b>, <b>compose_security_none</b>.

              Valid  colors  include:  <b>default</b>,  <b>black</b>, <b>red</b>, <b>green</b>, <b>yellow</b>, <b>blue</b>, <b>magenta</b>, <b>cyan</b>, <b>white</b>, <b>#</b><u>RRGGBB</u>,
              <b>color</b><u>N</u>.

              Valid attributes include: <b>none</b>, <b>bold</b>, <b>underline</b>, <b>reverse</b>, and <b>standout</b>.

              The <b>uncolor</b> command can be applied to the index, header and body objects only. It removes  entries
              from  the  list.  You  must  specify  the same <u>pattern</u> specified in the <b>color</b> command for it to be
              removed. The pattern “<b>*</b>” is a special token which means to clear the color list of all entries.

              For further information on colorization, please consult the NeoMutt manual.

       <b>crypt-hook</b> <u>regex</u> <u>keyid</u>

              The crypt-hook command provides a method by which you can specify the ID of the public key  to  be
              used when encrypting messages to a certain recipient. The meaning of <u>keyid</u> is to be taken broadly:
              This can be a different email address, a numerical <u>keyid</u>, or even just an arbitrary search string.
              You  may use multiple <b>crypt-hook</b>s with the same <u>regex</u>; multiple matching <b>crypt-hook</b>s result in the
              use of multiple <u>keyid</u>s for a recipient.

       <b>index-format-hook</b> <u>name</u> [<b>!</b>]<u>pattern</u> <u>format-string</u>
              This command is used to inject format strings dynamically  into  $index_format  based  on  pattern
              matching against the current message.

              The  $index_format  expando  <u>%@name@</u> specifies a placeholder for the injection. Index-format-hooks
              with the same <u>name</u> are matched using <u>pattern</u> against the current message. Matching is done in  the
              order  specified  in  the .neomuttrc, with the first match being used. The hook's <u>format-string</u> is
              then substituted and evaluated.

       <b>exec</b> <u>function</u> [ <u>function</u> ... ]

              This command can be used to execute any <u>function</u>. Functions are listed in the function  reference.
              “<b>exec</b> <u>function</u>” is equivalent to “<b>push</b> &lt;<u>function</u>&gt;”.

       <b>fcc-save-hook</b> <u>pattern</u> <u>mailbox</u>
       <b>fcc-hook</b> <u>pattern</u> <u>mailbox</u>
       <b>save-hook</b> <u>pattern</u> <u>mailbox</u>

              <b>fcc-save-hook</b>  is  a  shortcut,  equivalent  to  doing  both  a  <b>fcc-hook</b> and a <b>save-hook</b> with its
              arguments, including %-expansion on <u>mailbox</u> according to $index_format.

              <b>fcc-hook</b> is used to save outgoing mail in a mailbox other  than  $record.   NeoMutt  searches  the
              initial  list of message recipients for the first matching <u>pattern</u> and uses <u>mailbox</u> as the default
              “Fcc:” mailbox. If no match is found the message will be saved to $record mailbox.

              <b>save-hook</b> is used to override the default mailbox used when saving messages. <u>mailbox</u> will be  used
              as the default if the message matches <u>pattern</u>.

              To  provide  more  flexibility and good defaults, NeoMutt applies the expandos of $index_format to
              <u>mailbox</u> after it was expanded. See <u>PATTERNS</u> section below or consult section “<b>Message</b> <b>Matching</b>  <b>in</b>
              <b>Hooks</b>” in NeoMutt manual for information on the exact format of <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>folder-hook</b> [<u>-noregex</u>] <u>regex</u> <u>command</u>

              When  NeoMutt  enters  a  folder which matches <u>regex</u> (or, when <u>regex</u> is preceded by an exclamation
              mark, does not match <u>regex</u>), the given <u>command</u> is executed. The <u>-noregex</u> switch  controls  whether
              <u>regex</u> is matches as simple string equality or full regex match.

              When  several  <b>folder-hook</b>s match a given mail folder, they are executed in the order given in the
              configuration file.

       <b>group</b> [ <b>-group</b> <u>name</u> ... ] { <b>-rx</b> <u>regex</u> ... | <b>-addr</b> <u>address</u> ... }
       <b>ungroup</b> [ <b>-group</b> <u>name</u> ... ] { <b>*</b> | <b>-rx</b> <u>regex</u> ... | <b>-addr</b> <u>address</u> ... }

              <b>group</b> is used to directly add either addresses or regular expressions to the  specified  group  or
              groups.  The different categories of arguments to the <b>group</b> command can be in any order. The flags
              <b>-rx</b> and <b>-addr</b> specify what the following strings (that cannot  begin  with  a  hyphen)  should  be
              interpreted as: either a regular expression or an email address, respectively.

              <b>ungroup</b> is used to remove addresses or regular expressions from the specified group or groups. The
              syntax  is  similar to the <b>group</b> command, however the special character “<b>*</b>” can be used to empty a
              group of all of its contents.

              These address groups can also be created implicitly by the <b>alias</b>, <b>lists</b>, <b>subscribe</b> and  <b>alternates</b>
              commands by specifying the optional <b>-group</b> option.

              Once  defined, these address groups can be used in patterns to search for and limit the display to
              messages matching a group.

       <b>hdr_order</b> <u>header</u> [ <u>header</u> ... ]
       <b>unhdr_order</b> { <b>*</b> | <u>header</u> ... }

              With the <b>hdr_order</b> command you can specify an order in which NeoMutt will attempt to present these
              headers to you when viewing messages.

              “<b>unhdr_order</b> <b>*</b>” will clear all previous headers from the order  list,  thus  removing  the  header
              order effects set by the system-wide startup file.

       <b>ifdef</b> <u>symbol</u> "<u>config-command</u> [ <u>args</u> ... ]"
       <b>ifndef</b> <u>symbol</u> "<u>config-command</u> [ <u>args</u> ... ]"
       <b>finish</b>

              The  <b>ifdef</b> feature introduces three new commands to NeoMutt and allow you to share one config file
              between versions of NeoMutt that may have different features compiled in.

              A list of compile-time <u>symbol</u>s can be seen in the output of  the  command  “<b>neomutt</b>  <b>-v</b>”  (in  the
              “<b>Compile</b> <b>options</b>” section).

              <b>finish</b> is particularly useful when combined with <b>ifndef</b>.

       <b>ignore</b> <u>string</u> [ <u>string</u> ... ]
       <b>unignore</b> { <b>*</b> | <u>string</u> ... }

              The <b>ignore</b> command allows you to specify header fields which you don't normally want to see in the
              pager.  You do not need to specify the full header field name. For example, “<b>ignore</b> content-” will
              ignore all header fields that begin with  the  string  “content-”,  “<b>ignore</b>  *”  will  ignore  all
              headers.

              To  remove  a  previously  added  token  from  the  list,  use  the <b>unignore</b> command. For example,
              “<b>unignore</b> *” will remove all tokens from the ignore list.

       <b>lists</b> [ <b>-group</b> <u>name</u> ... ] <u>regex</u> [ <u>regex</u> ... ]
       <b>unlists</b> [ <b>-group</b> <u>name</u> ... ] { <b>*</b> | <u>regex</u> ... }
       <b>subscribe</b> [ <b>-group</b> <u>name</u> ... ] <u>regex</u> [ <u>regex</u> ... ]
       <b>unsubscribe</b> [ <b>-group</b> <u>name</u> ... ] { <b>*</b> | <u>regex</u> ... }

              NeoMutt maintains two lists of mailing list address regular  expressions,  a  list  of  subscribed
              mailing lists, and a list of known mailing lists. All subscribed mailing lists are known.

              The  <b>lists</b>  command  adds  a  mailing list address to the list of known mailing lists. The <b>unlists</b>
              command removes a mailing list from the lists of known and subscribed mailing lists.

              The <b>subscribe</b> command adds a mailing list to the lists of known and subscribed mailing lists.  The
              <b>unsubscribe</b> command removes it from the list of subscribed mailing lists.

              The <b>-group</b> flag adds all of the subsequent regular expressions to the <u>name</u>d group.

       <b>macro</b> <u>menu</u>[<b>,</b><u>menu</u> ... ] <u>key</u> <u>sequence</u> [ <u>description</u> ]
       <b>unmacro</b> { <b>*</b> | <u>menu</u> | [<b>,</b><u>menu</u>...]} [ <u>key</u> ]

              This  command  binds  the  given <u>sequence</u> of keys to the given <u>key</u> in the given <u>menu</u> or menus. For
              currently defined menus, see <b>bind</b> command above. To specify  multiple  menus,  put  only  a  comma
              between the menus.

              Optionally  you  can specify a descriptive text after <u>sequence</u>, which is shown in the help screens
              if they contain a <u>description</u>.

              Missing key sequence in <b>unmacro</b> command means unmacro all macros in menus given in <u>menu</u>.

       <b>mailboxes</b> [[<b>-label</b> <u>label</u>] | <b>-nolabel</b>]
                  [[<b>-notify</b> | <b>-nonotify</b>]
                  [<b>-poll</b> | <b>-nopoll</b>]
                  <u>mailbox</u>] [ ... ]
       <b>named-mailboxes</b> <u>label</u> <u>mailbox</u> [<u>label</u> <u>mailbox</u> ... ]
       <b>unmailboxes</b> { <b>*</b> | <u>mailbox</u> ... }

              The <b>mailboxes</b> specifies folders which can receive mail and which will be checked for new messages.
              When changing folders, pressing space will cycle through folders with new mail.

              The <b>named-mailboxes</b> is an alternative to <b>mailboxes</b> <b>-label</b> <u>label</u>.  NeoMutt  can  be  configured  to
              display the label instead of the mailbox path.

              The  <b>unmailboxes</b>  command is used to remove a file name from the list of folders which can receive
              mail. If “<b>*</b>” is specified as the file name, the list is emptied.

       <b>mailto_allow</b> { <b>*</b> | <u>header-field</u> ... }
       <b>unmailto_allow</b> { <b>*</b> | <u>header-field</u> ... }

              As a security measure, NeoMutt will only add user-approved <u>header-field</u>s from a <u>mailto:</u> URL.  This
              is  necessary  since  NeoMutt will handle certain <u>header-field</u>s, such as <b>Attach</b>, in a special way.
              The <b>mailto_allow</b> and <b>unmailto_allow</b> commands allow  the  user  to  modify  the  list  of  approved
              headers.

              NeoMutt initializes the default list to contain only the <b>Subject</b> and <b>Body</b> <u>header-field</u>s, which are
              the  only  requirement specified by the <u>mailto:</u> specification in RFC2368, and the <b>Cc</b>, <b>In-Reply-To</b>,
              <b>References</b> headers to aid with replies to mailing lists.

       <b>echo</b> <u>message</u>
              Prints <u>message</u> to the message window. After printing the message, echo will pause for  the  number
              of seconds specified by $sleep_time.

       <b>cd</b> <u>directory</u>
              Changes the current working directory.

       <b>mbox-hook</b> [<u>-noregex</u>] <u>regex</u> <u>mailbox</u>

              When  NeoMutt  changes  to  a  mail folder which matches <u>regex</u>, <u>mailbox</u> will be used as the “mbox”
              folder, i.e. read messages will be moved to that folder when the mail folder is left. The <u>-noregex</u>
              switch controls whether <u>regex</u> is matches as simple string equality or full regex match.

              Note that execution of <b>mbox-hook</b>s is dependent on the $move configuration variable. If set to “no”
              (the default), <b>mbox-hook</b>s will not be executed.

              The first matching <b>mbox-hook</b> applies.

       <b>message-hook</b> <u>pattern</u> <u>command</u>

              Before NeoMutt displays (or formats for replying or forwarding) a message which matches the  given
              <u>pattern</u>  (or,  when  it is preceded by an exclamation mark, does not match the <u>pattern</u>), the given
              <u>command</u> is executed.  When multiple <b>message-hook</b>s match, they are executed in the order  in  which
              they occur in the configuration file.

       <b>mime_lookup</b> <u>mime-type</u>[<b>/</b><u>mime-subtype</u>] [ <u>mime-type</u>[<b>/</b><u>mime-subtype</u>] ... ]
       <b>unmime_lookup</b> { <b>*</b> | <u>mime-type</u>[<b>/</b><u>mime-subtype</u>] ... }

              This  command permits you to define a list of “data” MIME content types for which NeoMutt will try
              to determine the actual file type from the file name, and not use a <b><a href="../man5/mailcap.5.html">mailcap</a></b>(5) entry given for the
              original MIME type. For instance, you may add the <b>application/octet-stream</b> MIME type to this list.

              In addition, the <b>unmime_lookup</b> command may be used to disable this feature for any particular MIME
              type if it had been set, for example in a global <u>neomuttrc</u>.

       <b>mono</b> <u>object</u> <u>attribute</u>
       <b>mono</b> { header | body } <u>attribute</u> <u>regex</u>
       <b>mono</b> index-object <u>attribute</u> <u>pattern</u>
       <b>unmono</b> { index-object | header | body } { <b>*</b> | <u>pattern</u> ... }

              For terminals which don't support color, you can still assign attributes to objects.

       <b>my_hdr</b> <u>string</u>
       <b>unmy_hdr</b> { <b>*</b> | <u>field</u> ... }

              Using <b>my_hdr</b>, you can define headers which will be added to the  messages  you  compose.  <b>unmy_hdr</b>
              will remove the given user-defined headers.

       <b>open-hook</b> <u>regex</u> "<u>shell-command</u>"
       <b>close-hook</b> <u>regex</u> "<u>shell-command</u>"
       <b>append-hook</b> <u>regex</u> "<u>shell-command</u>"

              These commands provide a way to handle compressed folders. The given <u>regex</u> specifies which folders
              are  taken  as  compressed  (e.g.   "<b>\.gz$</b>"). The commands tell NeoMutt how to uncompress a folder
              (<b>open-hook</b>), compress a folder (<b>close-hook</b>) or append a compressed mail  to  a  compressed  folder
              (<b>append-hook</b>).  The  <u>shell-command</u>  is  a  <b><a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a></b>(3)  like  format  string  and  must  contain two
              placeholders for from (<b>%f</b>) and to (<b>%t</b>) filenames which should be placed  inside  single-quotes  to
              prevent unintended shell expansions. Examples:

                     <b>append-hook</b> '<b>\.gz$</b>' "gzip --stdout '<b>%t</b>' &gt;&gt; '<b>%f</b>'"
                     <b>close-hook</b> '<b>\.gz$</b>' "gzip --stdout '<b>%t</b>' &gt; '<b>%f</b>'"
                     <b>open-hook</b> '<b>\.gz$</b>' "gzip --stdout --decompress '<b>%f</b>' &gt; '<b>%t</b>'"

       <b>push</b> <u>string</u>

              This command adds the named <u>string</u> to the beginning of the keyboard buffer. The string may contain
              control  characters,  key  names and function names like the sequence string in the <b>macro</b> command.
              You may use it to automatically run a sequence of commands at startup, or  when  entering  certain
              folders.

              For  using functions, it's important to use angle brackets (“&lt;” and “&gt;”) to make NeoMutt recognize
              the input as a function name. Otherwise it will simulate individual just keystrokes.

       <b>reply-hook</b> <u>pattern</u> <u>command</u>
       <b>send-hook</b> <u>pattern</u> <u>command</u>
       <b>send2-hook</b> <u>pattern</u> <u>command</u>

              These commands can be used to execute arbitrary configuration commands based  upon  recipients  of
              the  message.  <u>pattern</u>  is  used  to match the message, see section “<b>Message</b> <b>Matching</b> <b>in</b> <b>Hooks</b>” in
              manual for details.  <u>command</u> is executed when <u>pattern</u> matches.

              <b>reply-hook</b> is matched against the message you are replying to, instead  of  the  message  you  are
              sending.  <b>send-hook</b>  is  matched against all messages, both new and replies. <b>Note</b>, <b>reply-hook</b>s are
              matched before the <b>send-hook</b>, regardless of the order specified in the user's configuration file.

              <b>send2-hook</b> is matched every time a message is changed, either by  editing  it,  or  by  using  the
              compose  menu  to  change  its recipients or subject.  <b>send2-hook</b> is executed after <b>send-hook</b>, and
              can, e.g., be used to set parameters such as the $sendmail variable  depending  on  the  message's
              sender  address.  <b>Note</b>,  <b>send-hook</b>s  are  only  executed  once  after  getting the initial list of
              recipients.

       <b>score</b> <u>pattern</u> <u>value</u>
       <b>unscore</b> { <b>*</b> | <u>pattern</u> ... }

              The <b>score</b> command adds <u>value</u> to a message's score if <u>pattern</u> matches it. <u>pattern</u> is  a  string  in
              the  format  described  in the <u>PATTERNS</u> section below. <u>value</u> is a positive or negative integer.  A
              message's final score is the sum total of all matching score entries.

              The <b>unscore</b> command removes score entries from  the  list.  You  must  specify  the  same  <u>pattern</u>
              specified  in  the  <b>score</b>  command  for it to be removed. The pattern “<b>*</b>” is a special token which
              means to clear the list of all score entries.

       <b>set</b> { [ <b>no</b> | <b>inv</b> | <b>&amp;</b> | <b>?</b> ]<u>variable</u> } [ ... ]
       <b>set</b> { <u>variable</u>=<u>value</u> | <u>variable+=increment</u> | <u>variable-=decrement</u> } [ ... ]
       <b>unset</b> <u>variable</u>  [ <u>variable</u> ... ]
       <b>reset</b> <u>variable</u>  [ <u>variable</u> ... ]
       <b>toggle</b> <u>variable</u> [ <u>variable</u> ... ]
       <b>set</b> <u>variable</u> <b>?</b>

              These commands are used to set and manipulate configuration <u>variable</u>s.

              NeoMutt knows four basic types of <u>variable</u>s: boolean, number, string, string list and  quadoption.
              Boolean <u>variable</u>s can be <b>set</b> (true), <b>unset</b> (false), or <b>toggle</b>d. Number <u>variable</u>s can be assigned a
              positive  integer  <u>value</u>.  Value of number <u>variable</u>s can be incremented "<b>+=</b>" and decremented "<b>-=</b>".
              String list <u>variable</u>s use "<b>+=</b>" for appending increment to the string list  and  "<b>-=</b>"  for  removal
              decrement from the string list.

              String  <u>variable</u>s  consist of any number of printable characters and must be enclosed in quotes if
              they contain spaces or tabs. You may also use the escape sequences “<b>\n</b>” and “<b>\t</b>” for  newline  and
              tab, respectively. Content of a string <u>variable</u>s can be extended using "<b>+=</b>"

              Quadoption  <u>variable</u>s are used to control whether or not to be prompted for certain actions, or to
              specify a default action. A <u>value</u> of <b>yes</b> will cause the action to be carried out automatically  as
              if  you  had  answered “yes” to the question. Similarly, a <u>value</u> of <b>no</b> will cause the action to be
              carried out as if you had answered “no”.  A <u>value</u> of <b>ask-yes</b> will cause a prompt  with  a  default
              answer of “yes” and <b>ask-no</b> will provide a default answer of “no”.

              The  <b>toggle</b>  command automatically prepends the “<b>inv</b>” prefix to all specified <u>variable</u>s. The <b>unset</b>
              command automatically prepends the “<b>no</b>” prefix to all specified <u>variable</u>s. If you use the  command
              <b>set</b> and prefix the <u>variable</u> with “<b>&amp;</b>” this has the same behavior as the <b>reset</b> command.

              The  <b>reset</b> command resets all given <u>variable</u>s to the compile time defaults. With the <b>reset</b> command
              there exists the special <u>variable</u> <b>all</b>, which allows you to reset all  <u>variable</u>s  to  their  system
              defaults.

              Using the &lt;<b>enter-command</b>&gt; function, you can query the <u>value</u> of a <u>variable</u> by suffixing the name of
              the   <u>variable</u>   with   a  question  mark:  ":<b>set</b>  allow_8bit<b>?</b>".   The  old  prefix  query  syntax
              (":<b>set</b> <b>?</b>allow_8bit") is also still supported.

       <b>setenv</b> { <b>?</b><u>variable</u> | <u>variable</u> <u>value</u> }
       <b>unsetenv</b> <u>variable</u>

              You can alter the environment that NeoMutt passes on to its child processes using the  <b>setenv</b>  and
              <b>unsetenv</b> operators.

              You can also query current environment <u>value</u>s by prefixing a “<b>?</b>” character.

       <b>sidebar_pin</b> <u>mailbox</u> [ <u>mailbox</u> ...]
       <b>sidebar_unpin</b> { <b>*</b> | <u>mailbox</u> ... }

              The  <b>sidebar_pin</b> command specifies <u>mailbox</u>es that will always be displayed in the sidebar, even if
              $sidebar_new_mail_only is set and the <u>mailbox</u> does not contain new mail.

              The <b>sidebar_unpin</b> command is used to remove a <u>mailbox</u> from the list of always displayed <u>mailbox</u>es.
              Use “<b>sidebar_unpin</b> <b>*</b>” to remove all <u>mailbox</u>es.

       <b>source</b> <u>filename</u>

              This command allows the inclusion of initialization commands from other files.   If  the  <u>filename</u>
              begins with a tilde (“~”), it will be expanded to the path of your home directory.

              If  the  <u>filename</u>  ends with a vertical bar (“|”), then <u>filename</u> is considered to be an executable
              program from which to read input, (e.g.  “<b>source</b> <u><a href="file:~/bin/myscript">~/bin/myscript</a></u>|”).

              If the filename is relative and the command <b>source</b> is executed from the context of a configuration
              file, then the filename is interpreted relative to the directory of that configuration  file.   If
              the  command  is executed outside of a configuration file, e.g. from the prompt, then the filename
              is interpreted relative to the current working directory (see <b>cd</b> on  how  to  change  the  current
              working directory at runtime).

              Note:  A hook remembers the configuration file it was defined in and sets the context to that file
              when executing its commands.  As a result a <b>source</b> command  inside  a  hook  is  executed  in  the
              context  of  the  configuration  file  the  hook  was  defined  in.   Thus  relative filenames are
              interpreted relative to the configuration file the hook is defined in.

       <b>spam</b> <u>regex</u> <u>format</u>
       <b>nospam</b> { <b>*</b> | <u>regex</u> }

              NeoMutt has generalized support for external spam-scoring filters. By defining  your  spam  <u>regex</u>s
              with  the  <b>spam</b>  and  <b>nospam</b> commands, you can limit, search, and sort your mail based on its spam
              attributes, as determined by the external filter. You also can display the spam attributes in your
              index display using the %H selector in the $index_format  variable.  (Tip:  try  "%&lt;H?[%H]  &gt;"  to
              display spam tags only when they are defined for a given message).

              For  further  information  on spam-scoring filters, please consult the section “<b>Spam</b> <b>Detection</b>” in
              the NeoMutt manual.

       <b>subjectrx</b> <u>regex</u> <u>replacement</u>
       <b>unsubjectrx</b> { <b>*</b> | <u>regex</u> }

              The <b>subjectrx</b> command specifies a regular expression which, if  detected  in  a  message  subject,
              causes  the  subject  to  be  replaced  with  the <u>replacement</u> value. The <u>replacement</u> is subject to
              substitutions in the same way as for the <b>spam</b> command: %L for the text to the left of  the  match,
              %R  for  text  to the right of the match, and %1 for the first subgroup in the match (etc). If you
              simply want to erase the match, set it to “%L%R”.  Any number of <b>subjectrx</b> commands may coexist.

              Note this well: the <u>replacement</u> value replaces the entire subject, not just the match!

              <b>unsubjectrx</b> removes a given <b>subjectrx</b> from the substitution list.  If “<b>*</b>” is used as the argument,
              all substitutions will be removed.

       <b>subscribe-to</b> <u>imap-folder-uri</u>
       <b>unsubscribe-from</b> <u>imap-folder-uri</u>

              Tell the IMAP server to subscribe to or unsubscribe from the folder <u>imap-folder-uri</u>.  The argument
              must be an IMAP URI, e.g. “<b>subscribe-to</b> imaps://mail.example.org/inbox”.

              Subscription is an IMAP protocol feature where the server manages a list  of  subscribed  folders.
              This list can be queried by clients like NeoMutt.

              NeoMutt    uses    that    list    in    various   situations,   see   $imap_list_subscribed   and
              $imap_check_subscribed.

       <b>timeout-hook</b> <u>command</u>
       <b>startup-hook</b> <u>command</u>
       <b>shutdown-hook</b> <u>command</u>

              The <b>Global</b> <b>Hooks</b> feature introduces these hooks to NeoMutt. They are  called  when  global  events
              take  place  in  NeoMutt.  <b>startup-hook</b> and <b>shutdown-hook</b> are most likely to be useful to users of
              <b><a href="../man1/notmuch.1.html">notmuch</a></b>(1).

              <b>timeout-hook</b> runs a <u>command</u> periodically when NeoMutt checks for new mail.  This  hook  is  called
              every $timeout seconds.

              Before  NeoMutt opens the first mailbox when first starting, NeoMutt will run the <b>startup-hook</b> for
              the given <u>command</u>.

              Before NeoMutt is about to exit, and before the mailbox is closed, NeoMutt will run the  <b>shutdown-</b>
              <b>hook</b> for the given <u>command</u>.

       <b>unhook</b> { <b>*</b> | <u>hook-type</u> }

              This  command  permits  you  to flush hooks you have previously defined. You can either remove all
              hooks by giving the “<b>*</b>” character as an argument, or you can remove all hooks of a specific  <u>hook-</u>
              <u>type</u> by saying something like “<b>unhook</b> <u>send-hook</u>”.

</pre><h4><b>PATTERNS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Pattern</b> <b>Modifier</b>
       Many  of NeoMutt's commands allow you to specify a pattern to match messages (<b>limit</b>, <b>tag-pattern</b>, <b>delete-</b>
       <b>pattern</b>, the above mentioned <b>hook</b> commands etc.). The table “<b>Pattern</b> <b>modifiers</b>”  shows  several  ways  to
       select messages.

       Special  attention  has  to  be  paid  when  using  regular expressions inside of patterns. Specifically,
       NeoMutt's parser for these patterns will strip one level of backslash (“<b>\</b>”), which is normally  used  for
       quoting.  If  it is your intention to use a backslash in the regular expression, you will need to use two
       backslashes (“<b>\\</b>”) instead.

       You can force NeoMutt to treat <u>EXPR</u> as a simple <u>STRING</u> instead of  a  regular  expression  by  using  “<b>=</b>”
       instead of “<b>~</b>” in the pattern name. For example, “<b>=b</b> <b>*.*</b>” will find all messages that contain the literal
       <u>STRING</u> “<b>*.*</b>”. Simple substring matches are less powerful than regular expressions but can be considerably
       faster.  This  is  especially  true  for  IMAP folders, because substring matches can be performed on the
       server instead of by fetching every message.  IMAP  treats  “<b>=h</b>”  specially:  it  must  be  of  the  form
       “Header:  <u>substring</u>”  and will <b>not</b> partially match header names. The <u>substring</u> part may be omitted if you
       simply wish to find messages containing a particular header without regard to its value.

       Patterns matching lists of addresses (notably <b>c</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>p</b>, <b>P</b> and <b>t</b>) match if there is at least one  match  in
       the  whole  list.  If you want to make sure that all elements of that list match, you need to prefix your
       pattern with “<b>^</b>”.

       This example matches all mails which only has recipients from Germany.

              Matching all addresses in address lists: <b>^~C</b> <u>\.de$</u>

       You can restrict address pattern matching to aliases that you have defined with the  “<b>@</b>”  modifier.  This
       example matches messages whose recipients are all from Germany <b>and</b> who are known to your alias list.

              Matching restricted to aliases: <b>^@~C</b> <u>\.de$</u>

       To  match  any  defined  alias,  use  a  regular expression that matches <b>any</b> string. This example matches
       messages whose senders are known aliases.

              Matching any defined alias: <b>@~f</b> <u>.</u>

   <b>Nesting</b> <b>and</b> <b>Boolean</b> <b>Operators</b>
       Logical AND is performed by specifying more than one criterion.

              For example: <b>~t</b> <u>work</u> <b>~f</b> <u>smith</u>

       would select messages which contain the word “work” in the list of recipients  <b>and</b>  that  have  the  word
       “smith” in the “From:” header field.

       NeoMutt also recognizes the following operators to create more complex search patterns:

              • “<b>!</b>” — logical NOT operator
              • “<b>|</b>” — logical OR operator
              • “<b>()</b>” — logical grouping operator

       Here  is an example illustrating a complex search pattern. This pattern will select all messages which do
       <b>not</b> contain “work” in the “To:” <b>or</b> “Cc:” field <b>and</b> which are from “smith”.

              Using boolean operators in patterns: <b>!(~t</b> <u>work</u><b>|~c</b> <u>work</u><b>)</b> <b>~f</b> <u>smith</u>

       Here is an example using white space in the regular expression (note the “<b>'</b>”  and  “<b>"</b>”  delimiters).  For
       this  to  match,  the  mail's  subject  must match the “^Junk +From +Me$” <b>and</b> it must be from either “Jim
       +Somebody” <b>or</b> “Ed +SomeoneElse”:

              Quoting regex: <u>'</u><b>~s</b> <u>"^Junk</u> <u>+From</u> <u>+Me$"</u> <b>~f</b> <b>(</b><u>"Jim</u> <u>+Somebody"</u><b>|</b><u>"Ed</u> <u>+SomeoneElse"</u><b>)</b><u>'</u>

       <b>Note</b>: If a regular expression contains parenthesis, or  a  vertical  bar  (“<b>|</b>”),  you  must  enclose  the
       expression in double or single quotes since those characters are also used to separate different parts of
       NeoMutt's pattern language.

              For example: <b>~f</b> <u>"user@</u><b>(</b><u>home\.org</u><b>|</b><u>work\.com</u><b>)</b><u>"</u>

       Without  the  quotes,  the  parenthesis  wouldn't  end.  This  would  be  separated to two OR'd patterns:
       <b>~f</b> <u>user@(home\.org</u> and <u>work\.com)</u>. They are never what you want.

   <b>Searching</b> <b>by</b> <b>Date</b>
       NeoMutt supports two types of dates, <b>absolute</b> and <b>relative</b> for the “<b>~d</b>” and “<b>~r</b>” pattern.

       <b>Absolute</b> <b>Dates</b>
       Dates must be in <u>dd</u>[/<u>mm</u>[/[<u>CC</u>]<u>YY</u>]] format (day, month, century and year — all parts, with the exception of
       day, are optional, defaulting to the current month and year). An example of a valid range of dates is:

              Limit to messages matching: <b>~d</b> <u>20</u>/<u>1</u>/<u>95</u>-<u>31</u>/<u>10</u>

       Alternatively, you may use <u>YYYYMMDD</u> to specify a date.

       When given a two-digit year, NeoMutt will interpret values less than “70” as lying in  the  21st  century
       (i.e.,  “38”  means 2038 and not 1938, and “00” is interpreted as 2000), and values greater than or equal
       to “70” as lying in the 20th century.

       If you omit the <u>MIN</u>imum (first) date, and just specify -<u>dd</u>/<u>mm</u>/<u>YY</u>, all messages before the given date will
       be selected. If you omit the <u>MAX</u>imum (second) date, and specify <u>dd</u>/<u>mm</u>/<u>YY</u>-, all messages after  the  given
       date  will  be  selected. If you specify a single date with no dash (“<b>-</b>”), only messages sent/received on
       the given date will be selected.

       You can add error margins to absolute dates. An error margin is a sign (“<b>+</b>” or “<b>-</b>”), followed by a digit,
       followed by one of the units in table “<b>Date</b> <b>units</b>” below. As a special case, you can replace the sign  by
       a “<b>*</b>” character, which is equivalent to giving identical plus and minus error margins.
                             ┌──────────────┬──────┬───────┬────────┬───────┬───┬───┬───┐
                             │  <b>Date</b> <b>Unit</b>   │  d   │   w   │   m    │   y   │   │   │   │

       <b>Example</b>: To select any messages two weeks around January 15, 2001, you'd use the following pattern:

              Limit to messages matching: <b>~d</b> <u>15</u>/<u>1</u>/<u>2001</u><b>*</b><u>2</u><b>w</b>

       It is possible to give multiple error margins:

              which cumulate: <b>~d</b> <u>1</u>/<u>1</u>/<u>2001</u><b>-</b><u>1</u><b>w+</b><u>2</u><b>w*</b><u>3</u><b>d</b>

       <b>Relative</b> <b>Dates</b>
       This type of date is relative to the current date, and may be specified as:

              • “<b>&lt;</b><u>offset</u>” for messages newer than <u>offset</u> units
              • “<b>=</b><u>offset</u>” for messages exactly <u>offset</u> units old
              • “<b>&gt;</b><u>offset</u>” for messages older than <u>offset</u> units

       <u>offset</u> is specified as a positive number with one of the units from table “<b>Date</b> <b>units</b>”.

       <b>Example</b>: To select messages less than 1 month old, you would use:

              Limit to messages matching: <b>~d</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>1</u><b>m</b>

       <b>Note</b>: All dates used when searching are relative to the <b>local</b> time zone, so unless you change the setting
       of your $index_format to include a “<b>%[...]</b>” format, these are <b>not</b> the dates shown in the main index.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>abort_backspace</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If <u>set</u>, hitting backspace against an empty prompt aborts the prompt.

       <b>abort_key</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "007"

              Specifies  the  key  that  can be used to abort prompts.  The format is the same as used in "bind"
              commands.  The default is equivalent to "Ctrl-G".  Note that the specified key should not be  used
              in  other bindings, as the abort operation has higher precedence and the binding will not have the
              desired effect.

              Example:

              set abort_key = "&lt;Esc&gt;"

              Please note that when using &lt;Esc&gt; as the abort key, you may  also  want  to  set  the  environment
              variable  ESCDELAY  to  a  low  value  or  even 0 which will reduce the time that ncurses waits to
              distinguish singular &lt;Esc&gt; key presses from the start of a terminal escape sequence.  The  default
              time is 1000 milliseconds and thus quite noticeable.

       <b>abort_noattach</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: no

              If   set  to  <u>yes</u>,  when  composing  messages  containing  the  regular  expression  specified  by
              $abort_noattach_regex and no attachments are given, composition will be aborted.  If  set  to  <u>no</u>,
              composing messages as such will never be aborted.

              Example:

              set abort_noattach_regex = "\\&lt;attach(|ed|ments?)\\&gt;"

       <b>abort_noattach_regex</b>
              Type: regular expression
              Default: "\&lt;(attach|attached|attachments?)\&gt;"

              Specifies  a  regular  expression  to  match  against  the body of the message, to determine if an
              attachment was mentioned but  mistakenly  forgotten.   If  it  matches,  $abort_noattach  will  be
              consulted to determine if message sending will be aborted.

              Like other regular expressions in NeoMutt, the search is case sensitive if the pattern contains at
              least one upper case letter, and case insensitive otherwise.

       <b>abort_nosubject</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              If  set to <u>yes</u>, when composing messages and no subject is given at the subject prompt, composition
              will be aborted.  If set to <u>no</u>, composing messages with no subject given  at  the  subject  prompt
              will never be aborted.

       <b>abort_unmodified</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              If  set  to <u>yes</u>, composition will automatically abort after editing the message body if no changes
              are made to the file (this check only happens after the <u>first</u> edit of the file).  When set to  <u>no</u>,
              composition will never be aborted.

       <b>account_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              If  set,  this  command  is used to retrieve account credentials. The command is invoked passing a
              number of <u>--key</u> <u>value</u> arguments with the specifics of the account to lookup. The command writes to
              standard output a number of <u>key:</u>  <u>value</u>  lines.  Currently  supported  arguments  are  <u>--hostname</u>,
              <u>--username</u>,  and  <u>--type</u>,  where type can be any of <u>imap</u>, <u>imaps</u>, <u>pop</u>, <u>pops</u>, <u>smtp</u>, <u>smtps</u>, <u>nntp</u>, and
              <u>nntps</u>. Currently supported output lines are <u>login</u>, <u>username</u>, and <u>password</u>.

       <b>alias_file</b>
              Type: path
              Default: "<a href="file:~/.neomuttrc">~/.neomuttrc</a>"

              The default file in which to save aliases created by the &lt;create-alias&gt; function. Entries added to
              this file are encoded in the character set specified by  $config_charset  if  it  is  <u>set</u>  or  the
              current character set otherwise.

              <b>Note:</b>  NeoMutt  will  not  automatically  source  this  file; you must explicitly use the "source"
              command for it to be executed in case this option points to a dedicated alias file.

              The default for this option is the currently used neomuttrc file, or  "<a href="file:~/.neomuttrc">~/.neomuttrc</a>"  if  no  user
              neomuttrc was found.

       <b>alias_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "%3i %f%t %-15a %-56A | %C%&gt; %Y"

              Specifies  the  format  of the data displayed for the "alias" menu.  The following <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-style
              sequences are available:
              %a     Alias name
              %A     Full Address (Name and Email)
              %C     Comment
              %E     Email Address
              %f     Flags - currently, a "d" for an alias marked for deletion
              %i     Index number
              %N     Real name
              %t     Alias is tagged (selected)
              %Y     User-defined tags (labels)
              %&gt;X    right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
              %|X    pad to the end of the line with character "X"
              %*X    soft-fill with character "X" as pad

              For an explanation of "soft-fill", see the $index_format documentation.

              The following sequences are deprecated; they will be removed in the future.
              %c     Use %C instead
              %n     Use %i instead
              %r     Use %A instead

       <b>alias_sort</b>
              Type: sort order
              Default: alias

              Specifies how the entries in the "alias" menu are sorted.  The following are legal values:
              ‐ address (sort alphabetically by email address)
              ‐ alias (sort alphabetically by alias name)
              ‐ unsorted (leave in order specified in .neomuttrc)

              Note: This also affects the entries of the address query menu,  thus  potentially  overruling  the
              order of entries as generated by $query_command.

       <b>allow_8bit</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls  whether  8-bit  data  is  converted  to  7-bit  using either Quoted- Printable or Base64
              encoding when sending mail.

       <b>allow_ansi</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Controls whether ANSI color codes in messages (and color tags in rich text  messages)  are  to  be
              interpreted.  Messages containing these codes are rare, but if this option is <u>set</u>, their text will
              be  colored  accordingly.  Note  that  this  may  override  your color choices, and even present a
              security problem, since a message could include a line like

              [-- PGP output follows ...

              and give it the same color as your attachment color (see also $crypt_timestamp).

       <b>arrow_cursor</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, an arrow ("-&gt;") will be  used  to  indicate  the  current  entry  in  menus  instead  of
              highlighting  the  whole  line.   On  slow  network  or modem links this will make response faster
              because there is less that has to be redrawn on the screen when moving to  the  next  or  previous
              entries in the menu.

       <b>arrow_string</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "-&gt;"

              Specifies the string of arrow_cursor when arrow_cursor enabled.

       <b>ascii_chars</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will  use  plain  ASCII characters when displaying thread and attachment trees,
              instead of the default <u>ACS</u> characters.

       <b>ask_bcc</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will prompt you for blind-carbon-copy (Bcc) recipients before editing an  outgoing
              message.

       <b>ask_cc</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will  prompt  you for carbon-copy (Cc) recipients before editing the body of an
              outgoing message.

       <b>ask_followup_to</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If set, NeoMutt will prompt you for follow-up groups  before  editing  the  body  of  an  outgoing
              message.

       <b>ask_x_comment_to</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If  set,  NeoMutt  will  prompt  you for x-comment-to field before editing the body of an outgoing
              message.

       <b>assumed_charset</b>
              Type: string list
              Default: ""

              This variable is a colon-separated  list  of  character  encoding  schemes  for  messages  without
              character  encoding  indication.   Header  field values and message body content without character
              encoding indication would be assumed that they are written in one of this list.  By  default,  all
              the header fields and message body without any charset indication are assumed to be in "us-ascii".

              For example, Japanese users might prefer this:

              set assumed_charset="iso-2022-jp:euc-jp:shift_jis:utf-8"

              However, only the first content is valid for the message body.

       <b>attach_charset</b>
              Type: string list
              Default: ""

              This  variable  is a colon-separated list of character encoding schemes for text file attachments.
              NeoMutt uses this setting to guess which encoding files being attached are encoded in  to  convert
              them to a proper character set given in $send_charset.

              If  <u>unset</u>,  the  value of $charset will be used instead.  For example, the following configuration
              would work for Japanese text handling:

              set attach_charset="iso-2022-jp:euc-jp:shift_jis:utf-8"

              Note: for Japanese users, "iso-2022-*" must be put at the head of the  value  as  shown  above  if
              included.

       <b>attach_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "%u%D%I %t%4n %T%d %&gt; [%.7m/%.10M, %.6e%&lt;C?, %C&gt;, %s] "

              This  variable  describes  the  format  of  the  "attachment" menu.  The following <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-style
              sequences are understood:
              %C     Charset
              %c     Requires charset conversion ("n" or "c")
              %D     Deleted flag
              %d     Description (if none, falls back to %F)
              %e     MIME content-transfer-encoding
              %f     Filename
              %F     Filename in content-disposition header (if none, falls back to %f)
              %I     Disposition ("I" for inline, "A" for attachment)
              %m     Major MIME type
              %M     MIME subtype
              %n     Attachment number
              %Q     "Q", if MIME part qualifies for attachment counting
              %s     Size (see formatstrings-size)
              %T     Graphic tree characters
              %t     Tagged flag
              %u     Unlink (=to delete) flag
              %X     Number of qualifying MIME parts in this part and its children (please see the "attachments"
                     section for possible speed effects)
              %&gt;X    Right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
              %|X    Pad to the end of the line with character "X"
              %*X    Soft-fill with character "X" as pad

              For an explanation of "soft-fill", see the $index_format documentation.

       <b>attach_save_dir</b>
              Type: path
              Default: "./"

              The directory where attachments are saved.

       <b>attach_save_without_prompting</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This variable, when set to true, will cause attachments  to  be  saved  to  the  'attach_save_dir'
              location without prompting the user for the filename.

       <b>attach_sep</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "\n"

              The  separator to add between attachments when operating (saving, printing, piping, etc) on a list
              of tagged attachments.

       <b>attach_split</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If this variable is <u>unset</u>, when operating (saving, printing, piping, etc)  on  a  list  of  tagged
              attachments,  NeoMutt  will  concatenate  the  attachments  and  will  operate on them as a single
              attachment. The $attach_sep separator is added after  each  attachment.  When  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will
              operate on the attachments one by one.

       <b>attribution_intro</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "On %d, %n wrote:"

              This  is the string that will precede a replied-to message which is quoted in the main body of the
              reply (this is the case when $include is set).

              For a full listing of defined <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like sequences see the section on $index_format.  See also
              $attribution_locale.

       <b>attribution_locale</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              The locale used by <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3) to format dates in the attribution strings.  Legal values  are  the
              strings your system accepts for the locale environment variable $LC_TIME.

              This  variable  is  to  allow  the attribution date format to be customized by recipient or folder
              using hooks.  By default, NeoMutt will use your locale environment, so there is  no  need  to  set
              this except to override that default.

              Affected  variables  are:  $attribution_intro,  $attribution_trailer,  $forward_attribution_intro,
              $forward_attribution_trailer, $indent_string.

       <b>attribution_trailer</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              Similar to the $attribution_intro variable, this is the string that will come after  a  replied-to
              message which is quoted in the main body of the reply (this is the case when $include is set).

              For a full listing of defined <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like sequences see the section on $index_format.  See also
              $attribution_locale.

       <b>auto_edit</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  <u>set</u> along with $edit_headers, NeoMutt will skip the initial send-menu (prompting for subject
              and recipients) and allow you to  immediately  begin  editing  the  body  of  your  message.   The
              send-menu may still be accessed once you have finished editing the body of your message.

              <b>Note:</b>  when  this  option  is  <u>set</u>,  you  can't  use send-hooks that depend on the recipients when
              composing a new (non-reply) message, as the initial list of recipients is empty.

              Also see $fast_reply.

       <b>auto_subscribe</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt assumes the presence of a List-Post header means the recipient is subscribed  to
              the  list.  Unless the mailing list is in the "unsubscribe" or "unlist" lists, it will be added to
              the "subscribe" list.  Parsing and checking these things slows header reading down, so this option
              is disabled by default.

       <b>auto_tag</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, functions in the <u>index</u> menu which affect  a  message  will  be  applied  to  all  tagged
              messages  (if  there are any).  When unset, you must first use the &lt;tag-prefix&gt; function (bound to
              ";" by default) to make the next function apply to all tagged messages.

       <b>autocrypt</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, enables autocrypt, which provides passive encryption protection with keys exchanged  via
              headers.  See "autocryptdoc" for more details.  (Autocrypt only)

       <b>autocrypt_acct_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "%4n %-30a %20p %10s"

              This variable describes the format of the "autocrypt account" menu.  The following <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-style
              sequences are understood
              %a     email address
              %k     gpg keyid
              %n     current entry number
              %p     prefer-encrypt flag
              %s     status flag (active/inactive)
              %&gt;X    right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
              %|X    pad to the end of the line with character "X"
              %*X    soft-fill with character "X" as pad

              (Autocrypt only)

       <b>autocrypt_dir</b>
              Type: path
              Default: "<a href="file:~/.mutt/autocrypt">~/.mutt/autocrypt</a>"

              This  variable  sets  where  autocrypt  files  are  stored,  including  the GPG keyring and SQLite
              database.  See "autocryptdoc" for more details.  (Autocrypt only)

       <b>autocrypt_reply</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, replying to an autocrypt email automatically enables autocrypt in the  reply.   You  may
              want  to  unset  this  if  you're using the same key for autocrypt as normal web-of-trust, so that
              autocrypt isn't forced on for all encrypted replies.  (Autocrypt only)

       <b>beep</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When this variable is <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will beep when an error occurs.

       <b>beep_new</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When this variable is <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will beep whenever it prints a message  notifying  you  of  new
              mail.  This is independent of the setting of the $beep variable.

       <b>bounce</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              Controls  whether  you  will  be  asked to confirm bouncing messages.  If set to <u>yes</u> you don't get
              asked if you want to bounce a message. Setting this variable to <u>no</u> is not  generally  useful,  and
              thus not recommended, because you are unable to bounce messages.

       <b>bounce_delivered</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  this  variable  is  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will include Delivered-To headers when bouncing messages.
              Postfix users may wish to <u>unset</u> this variable.

              <b>Note:</b> On Debian systems, this option is unset by default in /etc/neomuttrc.

       <b>braille_friendly</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When this variable is <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will place the cursor at the beginning of the current  line  in
              menus,  even  when  the  $arrow_cursor variable is <u>unset</u>, making it easier for blind persons using
              Braille displays to follow these menus.  The option  is  <u>unset</u>  by  default  because  many  visual
              terminals don't permit making the cursor invisible.

       <b>browser_abbreviate_mailboxes</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  this  variable  is  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt will abbreviate mailbox names in the browser mailbox list,
              using '~' and '=' shortcuts.

              The default "alpha" setting of $browser_sort uses locale-based sorting (using  <a href="../man3/strcoll.3.html">strcoll</a>(3)),  which
              ignores some punctuation.  This can lead to some situations where the order doesn't make intuitive
              sense.  In those cases, it may be desirable to <u>unset</u> this variable.

       <b>browser_sort</b>
              Type: sort order
              Default: alpha

              Specifies  how  to  sort  entries  in  the  file  browser.   By  default,  the  entries are sorted
              alphabetically.  Valid values:
              ‐ alpha (alphabetically by name)
              ‐ count (total message count)
              ‐ date
              ‐ desc (description)
              ‐ new (new message count)
              ‐ size
              ‐ unsorted

              You may optionally use the "reverse-" prefix to  specify  reverse  sorting  order  (example:  "set
              browser_sort=reverse-date").

              The "unread" value is a synonym for "new".

       <b>browser_sort_dirs_first</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If this variable is <u>set</u>, the browser will group directories before files.

       <b>catchup_newsgroup</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              If  this  variable  is  <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will mark all articles in newsgroup as read when you quit the
              newsgroup (catchup newsgroup).

       <b>certificate_file</b>
              Type: path
              Default: "<a href="file:~/.mutt_certificates">~/.mutt_certificates</a>"

              This variable specifies the file where the certificates you  trust  are  saved.  When  an  unknown
              certificate  is  encountered,  you  are  asked  if  you  accept  it  or not. If you accept it, the
              certificate can also be saved in this file and further connections are automatically accepted.

              You can also manually add CA certificates in this file. Any server certificate that is signed with
              one of these CA certificates is also automatically accepted.

              Example:

              set certificate_file=<a href="file:~/.neomutt/certificates">~/.neomutt/certificates</a>

              (OpenSSL and GnuTLS only)

       <b>change_folder_next</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When this variable is <u>set</u>, the &lt;change-folder&gt; function mailbox suggestion will start at the  next
              folder in your "mailboxes" list, instead of starting at the first folder in the list.

       <b>charset</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              Character  set  your terminal uses to display and enter textual data.  It is also the fallback for
              $send_charset.

              Upon startup NeoMutt tries to derive this value from environment variables such  as  $LC_CTYPE  or
              $LANG.

              <b>Note:</b>  It  should  only  be  set  in  case  NeoMutt isn't able to determine the character set used
              correctly.

       <b>check_mbox_size</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When this variable is <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will use file  size  attribute  instead  of  access  time  when
              checking for new mail in mbox and mmdf folders.

              This  variable  is  <u>unset</u>  by default and should only be enabled when new mail detection for these
              folder types is unreliable or doesn't work.

              Note that enabling this  variable  should  happen  before  any  "mailboxes"  directives  occur  in
              configuration  files regarding mbox or mmdf folders because NeoMutt needs to determine the initial
              new mail status of such a  mailbox  by  performing  a  fast  mailbox  scan  when  it  is  defined.
              Afterwards the new mail status is tracked by file size changes.

       <b>check_new</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              <b>Note:</b> this option only affects <u>maildir</u> and <u>MH</u> style mailboxes.

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will check for new mail delivered while the mailbox is open.  Especially with MH
              mailboxes,  this  operation  can take quite some time since it involves scanning the directory and
              checking each file to see if it has already been looked at.  If this variable is <u>unset</u>,  no  check
              for new mail is performed while the mailbox is open.

       <b>collapse_all</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will collapse all threads when entering a folder.

       <b>collapse_flagged</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will not collapse a thread if it contains any flagged messages.

       <b>collapse_unread</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will not collapse a thread if it contains any unread messages.

       <b>color_directcolor</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt will use and allow 24bit colours (aka truecolor aka directcolor).  For colours
              to work properly support from the terminal is required as well as a properly set TERM  environment
              variable advertising the terminals directcolor capability, e.g. "TERM=xterm-direct".

              NeoMutt  tries  to detect whether the terminal supports 24bit colours and enables this variable if
              it does.  If this fails for some reason, you can force 24bit  colours  by  setting  this  variable
              manually.   You may also try to force a certain TERM environment variable by starting NeoMutt from
              a terminal as follows  (this  results  in  wrong  colours  if  the  terminal  does  not  implement
              directcolors):

              TERM=xterm-direct neomutt

              Note: This variable must be set before using any `color` commands.

       <b>compose_confirm_detach_first</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will prompt for confirmation when trying to use &lt;detach-file&gt; on the first entry
              in  the  compose  menu.  This  is  to  help  prevent  irreversible  loss  of  the typed message by
              accidentally hitting 'D' in the menu.

              Note: NeoMutt only prompts for the first entry.  It doesn't keep track of  which  message  is  the
              typed message if the entries are reordered, or if the first entry was already deleted.

       <b>compose_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "-- NeoMutt: Compose  [Approx. msg size: %l   Atts: %a]%&gt;-"

              Controls the format of the status line displayed in the "compose" menu.  This string is similar to
              $status_format, but has its own set of <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like sequences:
              %a     Total number of attachments
              %h     Local hostname
              %l     Approximate size (in bytes) of the current message (see formatstrings-size)
              %v     NeoMutt version string
              %&gt;X    right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
              %|X    pad to the end of the line with character "X"
              %*X    soft-fill with character "X" as pad

              See   the  text  describing  the  $status_format  option  for  more  information  on  how  to  set
              $compose_format.

       <b>compose_preview_min_rows</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 5

              This variable specifies the minimum number of rows that have  to  be  available  for  the  message
              preview window to shown.

       <b>compose_preview_above_attachments</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Show the message preview above the attachments list.  By default it is shown below it.

       <b>compose_show_preview</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, Neomutt will display a preview of message in the compose view.

       <b>compose_show_user_headers</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  <u>set</u>,  Neomutt  will  display  user-defined  headers  (set  via  my_hdr  or from editing with
              edit-headers).

       <b>config_charset</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              When defined, NeoMutt will recode commands in rc files from this encoding to the current character
              set as specified by $charset and aliases written to $alias_file from the current character set.

              Please note that if setting $charset it must be done before setting $config_charset.

              Recoding should be avoided as it may render unconvertible characters as question marks  which  can
              lead to undesired side effects (for example in regular expressions).

       <b>confirm_append</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will prompt for confirmation when appending messages to an existing mailbox.

       <b>confirm_create</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will prompt for confirmation when saving messages to a mailbox which does not
              yet exist before creating it.

       <b>content_type</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "text/plain"

              Sets the default Content-Type for the body of newly composed messages.

       <b>copy</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              This variable controls whether or not copies of your outgoing messages will  be  saved  for  later
              references.  Also see $record, $save_name, $force_name and "fcc-hook".

       <b>copy_decode_weed</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Controls  whether  NeoMutt  will  weed  headers  when  invoking the &lt;decode-copy&gt; or &lt;decode-save&gt;
              functions.

       <b>count_alternatives</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will recurse inside multipart/alternatives while performing attachment searching
              and counting(see attachments).

              Traditionally, multipart/alternative parts have simply represented different encodings of the main
              content of the email.  Unfortunately, some mail clients have started to  place  email  attachments
              inside  one  of  alternatives.   Setting  this  will  allow  NeoMutt  to  find  and count matching
              attachments hidden there, and include them in the index via %X or through ~X pattern matching.

       <b>crypt_auto_encrypt</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Setting this variable will cause NeoMutt to always attempt to PGP encrypt outgoing messages.  This
              is probably only useful in connection to the "send-hook" command.  It can be overridden by use  of
              the   pgp   menu,  when  encryption  is  not  required  or  signing  is  requested  as  well.   If
              $smime_is_default is <u>set</u>, then OpenSSL is used instead to create S/MIME messages and settings  can
              be overridden by use of the smime menu instead.  (Crypto only)

       <b>crypt_auto_pgp</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This  variable controls whether or not NeoMutt may automatically enable PGP encryption/signing for
              messages.  See also $crypt_auto_encrypt, $crypt_reply_encrypt, $crypt_auto_sign, $crypt_reply_sign
              and $smime_is_default.

       <b>crypt_auto_sign</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Setting this variable will cause NeoMutt to always  attempt  to  cryptographically  sign  outgoing
              messages.   This  can  be  overridden  by  use  of  the  pgp menu, when signing is not required or
              encryption is requested as well. If $smime_is_default is <u>set</u>, then  OpenSSL  is  used  instead  to
              create  S/MIME messages and settings can be overridden by use of the smime menu instead of the pgp
              menu.  (Crypto only)

       <b>crypt_auto_smime</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This variable controls whether or not NeoMutt may automatically enable  S/MIME  encryption/signing
              for    messages.    See    also   $crypt_auto_encrypt,   $crypt_reply_encrypt,   $crypt_auto_sign,
              $crypt_reply_sign and $smime_is_default.

       <b>crypt_chars</b>
              Type: character string
              Default: "SPsK "

              Controls the characters used in cryptography flags.
              <b>Character</b>
                     <b>Default</b> <b>Description</b>
              1      S The mail is signed, and the signature is successfully verified.
              2      P The mail is PGP encrypted.
              3      s The mail is signed.
              4      K The mail contains a PGP public key.
              5      &lt;space&gt; The mail has no crypto info.

       <b>crypt_confirm_hook</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If set, then you will be prompted for confirmation of keys when using the <u>crypt-hook</u> command.   If
              unset,  no  such  confirmation  prompt  will  be  presented.  This is generally considered unsafe,
              especially where typos are concerned.

       <b>crypt_opportunistic_encrypt</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Setting this variable will cause NeoMutt to automatically enable and disable encryption, based  on
              whether all message recipient keys can be located by NeoMutt.

              When  this option is enabled, NeoMutt will enable/disable encryption each time the TO, CC, and BCC
              lists are edited.  If $edit_headers is set, NeoMutt will also do  so  each  time  the  message  is
              edited.

              While  this is set, encryption can't be manually enabled/disabled.  The pgp or smime menus provide
              a selection to temporarily disable this option for the current message.

              If $crypt_auto_encrypt or $crypt_reply_encrypt enable encryption for a message, this  option  will
              be  disabled  for that message.  It can be manually re-enabled in the pgp or smime menus.  (Crypto
              only)

       <b>crypt_opportunistic_encrypt_strong_keys</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, this modifies the behavior of $crypt_opportunistic_encrypt to only  search  for  "strong
              keys",  that  is,  keys  with  full  validity according to the web-of-trust algorithm.  A key with
              marginal or no validity will not enable opportunistic encryption.

              For S/MIME, the behavior depends on the backend.  Classic S/MIME will filter for certificates with
              the 't'(trusted) flag in the .index file.  The GPGME backend will use the  same  filters  as  with
              OpenPGP,   and   depends   on   GPGME's   logic   for   assigning   the   GPGME_VALIDITY_FULL  and
              GPGME_VALIDITY_ULTIMATE validity flag.

       <b>crypt_protected_headers_read</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When set, NeoMutt will display protected headers ("Memory Hole") in the pager, When  set,  NeoMutt
              will  display  protected  headers  in  the  pager, and will update the index and header cache with
              revised headers.

              Protected headers are stored inside the encrypted or signed  part  of  an  an  email,  to  prevent
              disclosure  or tampering.  For more information see https://github.com/autocrypt/protected-headers
              Currently NeoMutt only supports the Subject header.

              Encrypted messages using protected headers often substitute the  exposed  Subject  header  with  a
              dummy  value  (see  $crypt_protected_headers_subject).   NeoMutt  will  update  its concept of the
              correct subject <b>after</b> the message is opened, i.e. via  the  &lt;display-message&gt;  function.   If  you
              reply  to  a  message before opening it, NeoMutt will end up using the dummy Subject header, so be
              sure to open such a message first.  (Crypto only)

       <b>crypt_protected_headers_save</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When $crypt_protected_headers_read is set, and a message  with  a  protected  Subject  is  opened,
              NeoMutt   will  save  the  updated  Subject  into  the  header  cache  by  default.   This  allows
              searching/limiting based on the protected Subject header if  the  mailbox  is  re-opened,  without
              having to re-open the message each time.  However, for mbox/mh mailbox types, or if header caching
              is not set up, you would need to re-open the message each time the mailbox was reopened before you
              could see or search/limit on the protected subject again.

              When this variable is set, NeoMutt additionally saves the protected Subject back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clear-text</b>
              <b>message</b>  <b>headers</b>.  This provides better usability, but with the tradeoff of reduced security.  The
              protected Subject header, which may have previously been encrypted, is now stored in clear-text in
              the message headers.  Copying the message elsewhere, via NeoMutt or external tools,  could  expose
              this  previously  encrypted data.  Please make sure you understand the consequences of this before
              you enable this variable.  (Crypto only)

       <b>crypt_protected_headers_subject</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "..."

              When $crypt_protected_headers_write is set, and the message is marked for encryption, this will be
              substituted into the Subject field in the message headers.

              To prevent a subject from being substituted, unset this variable, or set it to the  empty  string.
              (Crypto only)

       <b>crypt_protected_headers_weed</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Controls whether NeoMutt will weed protected header fields.  (Crypto only)

       <b>crypt_protected_headers_write</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When set, NeoMutt will generate protected headers for signed and encrypted emails.

              Protected  headers  are  stored  inside  the  encrypted  or signed part of an an email, to prevent
              disclosure or tampering.  For more information see https://github.com/autocrypt/protected-headers

              Currently NeoMutt only supports the Subject header.  (Crypto only)

       <b>crypt_reply_encrypt</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If <u>set</u>, automatically PGP or OpenSSL encrypt replies to messages  which  are  encrypted.   (Crypto
              only)

       <b>crypt_reply_sign</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u>, automatically PGP or OpenSSL sign replies to messages which are signed.

              <b>Note:</b> this does not work on messages that are encrypted <u>and</u> signed!  (Crypto only)

       <b>crypt_reply_sign_encrypted</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If  <u>set</u>,  automatically  PGP  or  OpenSSL sign replies to messages which are encrypted. This makes
              sense in combination with $crypt_reply_encrypt, because it allows you to sign all  messages  which
              are  automatically  encrypted.   This  works  around  the problem noted in $crypt_reply_sign, that
              NeoMutt is not able to find out whether an encrypted message is also signed.  (Crypto only)

       <b>crypt_encryption_info</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will include an informative block before an encrypted part, with details about the
              encryption.  (Crypto only)

       <b>crypt_timestamp</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will include a time stamp in the  lines  surrounding  PGP  or  S/MIME  output,  so
              spoofing  such  lines is more difficult.  If you are using colors to mark these lines, and rely on
              these, you may <u>unset</u> this setting.  (Crypto only)

       <b>crypt_use_gpgme</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This variable controls the use of the GPGME-enabled crypto backends.  If it is <u>set</u> and NeoMutt was
              built with GPGME support, the gpgme code for S/MIME and PGP will be used instead  of  the  classic
              code.   Note  that  you  need to set this option in .neomuttrc; it won't have any effect when used
              interactively.

              Note that the GPGME backend does not support creating old-style inline (traditional) PGP encrypted
              or signed messages (see $pgp_auto_inline).

       <b>crypt_use_pka</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Controls  whether  NeoMutt  uses  PKA  (see  <a href="http://www.g10code.de/docs/pka-intro.de.pdf">http://www.g10code.de/docs/pka-intro.de.pdf</a>)   during
              signature verification (only supported by the GPGME backend).

       <b>crypt_verify_sig</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              If  <u>"yes"</u>,  always  attempt to verify PGP or S/MIME signatures.  If <u>"ask-*"</u>, ask whether or not to
              verify the signature.  If <u>"no"</u>, never attempt to verify cryptographic signatures.  (Crypto only)

       <b>date_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "!%a, %b %d, %Y at %I:%M:%S%p %Z"

              Instead of using $date_format it is encouraged to  use  "%[fmt]"  directly  in  the  corresponding
              format  strings,  where  "fmt"  is the value of $date_format.  This allows for a more fine grained
              control of the different menu needs.

              This variable controls the format of the date printed by the "%d" sequence in $index_format.  This
              is passed to the <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3) function to process the date, see the man page for the proper syntax.

              Unless the first character in the string is a bang  ("!"),  the  month  and  week  day  names  are
              expanded  according  to  the  locale.  If the first character in the string is a bang, the bang is
              discarded, and the month and week day names in the rest of the string are expanded in the <u>C</u> locale
              (that is in US English).

              Format strings using this variable are:

              UI:   $folder_format,   $index_format,   $mailbox_folder_format,   $message_format.IP   Composing:
              $attribution_intro,   $forward_attribution_intro,  $forward_attribution_trailer,  $forward_format,
              $indent_string.

       <b>debug_file</b>
              Type: path
              Default: "<a href="file:~/.neomuttdebug">~/.neomuttdebug</a>"

              Debug logging is controlled by the variables $debug_file and $debug_level.  $debug_file  specifies
              the root of the filename.  NeoMutt will add "0" to the end.  Each time NeoMutt is run with logging
              enabled,  the  log  files  are  rotated.   A  maximum of five log files are kept, numbered 0 (most
              recent) to 4 (oldest).

              This option can be enabled on the command line, "neomutt -l mylog"

              See also: $debug_level

       <b>debug_level</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              Debug logging is controlled by the variables $debug_file and $debug_level.

              The debug level controls how much information is saved to the log file.  If  you  have  a  problem
              with  NeoMutt,  then  enabling  logging  may help find the cause.  Levels 1-3 will usually provide
              enough information for writing a bug report.  Levels 4,5 will be extremely verbose.

              Warning: Logging at high levels may save private information to the file.

              This option can be enabled on the command line, "neomutt -d 2"

              See also: $debug_file

       <b>default_hook</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "~f %s !~P | (~P ~C %s)"

              This variable controls how some hooks are interpreted if their pattern is  a  plain  string  or  a
              regex. i.e. they don't contain a pattern, like ~f

              The  hooks  are:  fcc-hook, fcc-save-hook, index-format-hook, message-hook, reply-hook, save-hook,
              send-hook and send2-hook.

              The hooks are expanded when they are declared, so a hook will  be  interpreted  according  to  the
              value of this variable at the time the hook is declared.

              The  default  value  matches  if the message is either from a user matching the regular expression
              given, or if it is from you (if the from address matches "alternates") and is to  or  cc'ed  to  a
              user matching the given regular expression.

       <b>delete</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              Controls  whether  or not messages are really deleted when closing or synchronizing a mailbox.  If
              set to <u>yes</u>, messages marked for deleting will automatically be purged without prompting.   If  set
              to <u>no</u>, messages marked for deletion will be kept in the mailbox.

       <b>delete_untag</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If  this  option is <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will untag messages when marking them for deletion.  This applies
              when you either explicitly delete a message, or when you save it to another folder.

       <b>devel_security</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If  this  option  is  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will  enable  the  <b>Security</b>   development   features.    See:
              https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/discussions/4251

       <b>digest_collapse</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If  this  option  is  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt's  received-attachments  menu  will  not  show the subparts of
              individual messages in a multipart/digest.  To see these subparts, press "v" on that menu.

       <b>display_filter</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              When set, specifies a command used to filter messages.  When a message is viewed it is  passed  as
              standard input to $display_filter, and the filtered message is read from the standard output.

              When  preparing the message, NeoMutt inserts some escape sequences into the text.  They are of the
              form: &lt;esc&gt;]9;XXX&lt;bel&gt; where "XXX" is a random 64-bit number.

              If these escape sequences interfere with your filter, they  can  be  removed  using  a  tool  like
              ansifilter or sed 's/^\x1b]9;[0-9]\+\x7//'

              If  they  are removed, then PGP and MIME headers will no longer be coloured.  This can be fixed by
              adding this to your config: color body magenta default '^\[-- .* --\]$'.

       <b>dsn_notify</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              This variable sets the request for when notification is returned.  The string consists of a  comma
              separated list (no spaces!) of one or more of the following: <u>never</u>, to never request notification,
              <u>failure</u>, to request notification on transmission failure, <u>delay</u>, to be notified of message delays,
              <u>success</u>, to be notified of successful transmission.

              Example:

              set dsn_notify="failure,delay"

              <b>Note:</b>  when  using  $sendmail for delivery, you should not enable this unless you are either using
              Sendmail 8.8.x or greater or a MTA providing a <a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a>(1)-compatible interface supporting the  -N
              option  for  DSN. For SMTP delivery, DSN support is auto-detected so that it depends on the server

       <b>dsn_return</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              This variable controls how much of your message is returned in DSN messages.  It  may  be  set  to
              either <u>hdrs</u> to return just the message header, or <u>full</u> to return the full message.

              Example:

              set dsn_return=hdrs

              <b>Note:</b>  when  using  $sendmail for delivery, you should not enable this unless you are either using

       <b>duplicate_threads</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This variable controls whether NeoMutt, when $sort is set to <u>threads</u>, threads  messages  with  the
              same  Message-Id  together.   If it is <u>set</u>, it will indicate that it thinks they are duplicates of
              each other with an equals sign in the thread tree.

       <b>edit_headers</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This option allows you to edit the header of your outgoing messages along with the  body  of  your
              message.

              Although  the compose menu may have localized header labels, the labels passed to your editor will
              be standard RFC2822 headers, (e.g. To:, Cc:, Subject:).  Headers added in your editor must also be
              RFC2822 headers, or one  of  the  pseudo  headers  listed  in  "edit-header".   NeoMutt  will  not
              understand localized header labels, just as it would not when parsing an actual email.

              <b>Note</b>  that  changes  made  to  the  References: and Date: headers are ignored for interoperability
              reasons.

       <b>editor</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This variable specifies which editor is used by NeoMutt.  It defaults to the value of the $VISUAL,
              or $EDITOR, environment variable, or to the string "<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?editor">/usr/bin/editor</a>" if neither of those are set.

              The $editor string may contain a <u>%s</u> escape, which will be replaced by the name of the file  to  be
              edited.   If  the  <u>%s</u>  escape  does  not  appear in $editor, a space and the name to be edited are
              appended.

              The resulting string is then executed by running

              sh -c 'string'

              where <u>string</u> is the expansion of $editor described above.

       <b>empty_subject</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "Re: your mail"

              This variable specifies the subject to be used when replying to an email with  an  empty  subject.
              It defaults to "Re: your mail".

       <b>encode_from</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will quoted-printable encode messages when they contain the string "From " (note
              the  trailing  space)  in  the beginning of a line.  This is useful to avoid the tampering certain
              mail delivery and transport agents tend to do with  messages  (in  order  to  prevent  tools  from
              misinterpreting the line as a mbox message separator).

       <b>entropy_file</b>
              Type: path
              Default: ""

              The  file  which  includes  random data that is used to initialize SSL library functions. (OpenSSL
              only)

       <b>envelope_from_address</b>
              Type: e-mail address
              Default: ""

              Manually  sets  the  <u>envelope</u>  sender  for  outgoing  messages.   This   value   is   ignored   if
              $use_envelope_from is <u>unset</u>.

       <b>external_search_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              If  set,  contains the name of the external program used by "~I" patterns.  This will usually be a
              wrapper script around mairix, mu, or similar indexers other  than  notmuch  (for  which  there  is
              optional special support).

              Here is an example how it works.  Let's assume $external_search_command is set to "mairix_filter",
              and  mairix_filter is a script which runs the old but well loved mairix indexer with the arguments
              given to mairix_filter, in the "raw" mode of mairix, producing on the standard output  a  list  of
              Message-IDs, one per line.

              If  possible,  it  also filters down the results coming from mairix such that only messages in the
              current folder remain.  It can do this because it gets a hidden first argument which is  the  path
              to the folder.  (This can be the type of clean and simple script called a <u>one-liner</u>.)

              Now  if  NeoMutt  gets  a  limit  or  tag  command  followed by the pattern "~I '-t s:bleeping='",
              mairix_filter runs mairix with the arguments from inside the quotes (the quotes are needed because
              of the space after "-t"), mairix finds all messages  with  "bleeping"  in  the  Subject  plus  all
              messages sharing threads with these and outputs their file names, and mairix_filter translates the
              file  names  into  Message-IDs.   Finally,  NeoMutt reads the Message-IDs and targets the matching
              messages with the command given to it.

              You, the user, still have to rewrite the mairix_filter  script  to  match  the  behavior  of  your
              indexer,  but this should help users of indexers other than notmuch to integrate them cleanly with
              NeoMutt.

       <b>fast_reply</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, the initial prompt for recipients (to,  cc,  bcc)  and  subject  are  skipped  when  the
              relevant  information  is  already provided.  These cases include replying to messages and passing
              the relevant command line arguments. The initial  prompt  for  recipients  is  also  skipped  when
              composing  a  new  message  to the current message sender, while the initial prompt for subject is
              also skipped when forwarding messages.

              <b>Note:</b> this variable has no effect when the $auto_edit variable is <u>set</u>.

              See also: $auto_edit, $edit_headers, $ask_cc, $ask_bcc

       <b>fcc_attach</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              This variable controls whether or not attachments on outgoing messages are saved  along  with  the
              main body of your message.

              Note: $fcc_before_send forces the default (set) behavior of this option.

       <b>fcc_before_send</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  this  variable  is  <u>set</u>,  FCCs  will  occur before sending the message.  Before sending, the
              message cannot be manipulated, so it will be stored  the  exact  same  as  sent:  $fcc_attach  and
              $fcc_clear will be ignored (using their default values).

              When <u>unset</u>, the default, FCCs will occur after sending.  Variables $fcc_attach and $fcc_clear will
              be respected, allowing it to be stored without attachments or encryption/signing if desired.

       <b>fcc_clear</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  this  variable  is  <u>set</u>,  FCCs will be stored unencrypted and unsigned, even when the actual
              message is encrypted and/or signed.

              Note: $fcc_before_send forces the default (unset) behavior of this option.  (PGP only)

              See also $pgp_self_encrypt, $smime_self_encrypt

       <b>flag_chars</b>
              Type: character string
              Default: "*!DdrONon- "

              Controls the characters used in several flags.
              <b>Character</b>
                     <b>Default</b> <b>Description</b>
              1      * The mail is tagged.
              2      !  The mail is flagged as important.
              3      D The mail is marked for deletion.
              4      d The mail has attachments marked for deletion.
              5      r The mail has been replied to.
              6      O The mail is Old (Unread but seen).
              7      N The mail is New (Unread but not seen).
              8      o The mail thread is Old (Unread but seen).
              9      n The mail thread is New (Unread but not seen).
              10     - The mail is read - %S expando.
              11     &lt;space&gt; The mail is read - %Z expando.

       <b>flag_safe</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If set, flagged messages can't be deleted.

       <b>folder</b>
              Type: mailbox
              Default: "<a href="file:~/Mail">~/Mail</a>"

              Specifies the default location of your mailboxes.  A "+" or "=" at the  beginning  of  a  pathname
              will  be  expanded to the value of this variable.  Note that if you change this variable (from the
              default) value you need to make sure that the assignment occurs <u>before</u> you use "+" or "=" for  any
              other variables since expansion takes place when handling the "mailboxes" command.

       <b>folder_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "%2C %t %N %F %2l %-8.8u %-8.8g %8s %d %i"

              This  variable  allows  you  to  customize  the file browser display to your personal taste.  This
              string is similar to $index_format, but has its own set of <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like sequences:
              %a

                     Alert: 1 if user is notified of new mail
              %C

                     Current file number
              %d

                     Date/time folder was last modified
              %D

                     Date/time folder was last modified using $date_format.  It is encouraged  to  use  "%[fmt]"
                     instead, where "fmt" is the value of $date_format.
              %f

                     Filename  ("/"  is appended to directory names, "@" to symbolic links and "*" to executable
                     files)
              %F

                     File permissions
              %g

                     Group name (or numeric gid, if missing)
              %i

                     Description of the folder
              %l

                     Number of hard links
              %m     * Number of messages in the mailbox
              %n     * Number of unread messages in the mailbox
              %N

                     "N" if mailbox has new mail, " " (space) otherwise
              %p

                     Poll: 1 if Mailbox is checked for new mail
              %s

                     Size in bytes (see formatstrings-size)
              %t

                     "*" if the file is tagged, blank otherwise
              %u

                     Owner name (or numeric uid, if missing)
              %[fmt]

                     Date/time folder was last modified using an <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3) expression
              %&gt;X

                     Right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
              %|X

                     Pad to the end of the line with character "X"
              %*X

                     Soft-fill with character "X" as pad

              For an explanation of "soft-fill", see the $index_format documentation.

              * = can be optionally printed if nonzero

              %m, %n, and %N only work for monitored mailboxes.  %m requires $mail_check_stats to  be  set.   %n
              requires $mail_check_stats to be set (except for IMAP mailboxes).

       <b>followup_to</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls whether or not the "Mail-Followup-To:" header field is generated when sending mail.  When
              <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will  generate  this field when you are replying to a known mailing list, specified
              with the "subscribe" or "lists" commands.

              This field has two purposes.  First, preventing you from receiving duplicate copies of replies  to
              messages  which you send to mailing lists, and second, ensuring that you do get a reply separately
              for any messages sent to known lists to which you are not subscribed.

              The header will contain only the list's address for subscribed lists, and both  the  list  address
              and  your  own  email  address for unsubscribed lists.  Without this header, a group reply to your
              message sent to a subscribed list will be sent to both the list and your address, resulting in two
              copies of the same email for you.

       <b>followup_to_poster</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              If this variable is <u>set</u> and the keyword "poster" is present in <u>Followup-To</u>  header,  follow-up  to
              newsgroup  function  is not permitted.  The message will be mailed to the submitter of the message
              via mail.

       <b>force_name</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This variable is similar to $save_name, except that NeoMutt will store a  copy  of  your  outgoing
              message by the username of the address you are sending to even if that mailbox does not exist.

              Also see the $record variable.

       <b>forward_attachments</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              When  forwarding  inline (i.e. $mime_forward <u>unset</u> or answered with "no" and $forward_decode <u>set</u>),
              attachments which cannot be decoded in a reasonable manner will be attached to the newly  composed
              message if this quadoption is <u>set</u> or answered with "yes".

       <b>forward_attribution_intro</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "----- Forwarded message from %f -----"

              This  is  the  string  that  will precede a message which has been forwarded in the main body of a
              message (when $mime_forward is unset).  For a full listing of defined <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like sequences see
              the section on $index_format.  See also $attribution_locale.

       <b>forward_attribution_trailer</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "----- End forwarded message -----"

              This is the string that will follow a message which has been forwarded  in  the  main  body  of  a
              message (when $mime_forward is unset).  For a full listing of defined <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like sequences see
              the section on $index_format.  See also $attribution_locale.

       <b>forward_decode</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls  the  decoding  of  complex MIME messages into text/plain when forwarding a message.  The
              message header is also RFC2047 decoded.  This variable is only used, if  $mime_forward  is  <u>unset</u>,
              otherwise $mime_forward_decode is used instead.

       <b>forward_decrypt</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls  the handling of encrypted messages when forwarding a message.  When <u>set</u>, the outer layer
              of encryption is  stripped  off.   This  variable  is  only  used  if  $mime_forward  is  <u>set</u>  and
              $mime_forward_decode is <u>unset</u>.

       <b>forward_edit</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              This  quadoption  controls  whether  or  not  the  user is automatically placed in the editor when
              forwarding messages.  For those who always want to forward with no modification, use a setting  of
              "no".

       <b>forward_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "[%a: %s]"

              This  variable  controls  the  default subject when forwarding a message.  It uses the same format
              sequences as the $index_format variable.

       <b>forward_quote</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, forwarded messages included in the main body  of  the  message  (when  $mime_forward  is
              <u>unset</u>) will be quoted using $indent_string.

       <b>forward_references</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  <u>set</u>,  forwarded messages set the "In-Reply-To:" and "References:" headers in the same way as
              normal replies would. Hence the forwarded message becomes part of the original thread  instead  of
              starting a new one.

       <b>from</b>
              Type: e-mail address
              Default: ""

              When  <u>set</u>,  this  variable contains a default "from" address.  It can be overridden using "my_hdr"
              (including from a "send-hook") and $reverse_name.  This variable is ignored if $use_from is <u>unset</u>.

              If not specified, then it may be read from the environment variable $EMAIL.

       <b>from_chars</b>
              Type: character string
              Default: ""

              Controls the character used to prefix the %F and %L fields in the index.
              <b>Character</b>
                     <b>Description</b>
              1      Mail is written by you and has a To address, or has a known mailing list in the To address.
              2      Mail is written by you and has a Cc address, or has a known mailing list in the Cc address.
              3      Mail is written by you and has a Bcc address.
              4      All remaining cases.

              If this is empty or unset (default), the traditional long "To ", "Cc " and  "Bcc  "  prefixes  are
              used.   If  set but too short to include a character for a particular case, a single space will be
              prepended to the field.  To prevent any prefix at all from being added in a particular  case,  use
              the special value CR (aka ^M) for the corresponding character.

              This  slightly  odd interface is necessitated by NeoMutt's handling of string variables; one can't
              tell a variable that is unset from one that is set to the empty string.

       <b>gecos_mask</b>
              Type: regular expression
              Default: "^[^,]*"

              A regular expression used by NeoMutt to parse the GECOS field of a password entry  when  expanding
              the  alias.   The  default  value  will return the string up to the first "," encountered.  If the
              GECOS field contains a string like "lastname, firstname" then you should set it to ".*".

              This can be useful if you see the following behavior: you address an e-mail to  user  ID  "stevef"
              whose  full  name is "Steve Franklin".  If NeoMutt expands "stevef" to '"Franklin" <a href="mailto:stevef@foo.bar">stevef@foo.bar</a>'
              then you should set the $gecos_mask to a regular expression that will  match  the  whole  name  so
              NeoMutt will expand "Franklin" to "Franklin, Steve".

       <b>greeting</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              When  set,  this  is  the  string  that  will  precede  every  message as a greeting phrase to the
              recipients.

              "Format strings" are similar to the strings used in the "C" function printf to format output  (see
              the man page for more detail).  The following sequences are defined in NeoMutt:

              %n     Recipient's real name
              %u     User (login) name of recipient
              %v     First name of recipient

       <b>group_index_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "%4C %M%N %5s  %-45.45f %d"

              This  variable allows you to customize the newsgroup browser display to your personal taste.  This
              string is similar to "index_format", but has its own set of printf()-like sequences:
              %a     Alert: 1 if user is notified of new mail
              %C     Current newsgroup number
              %d     Description of newsgroup (becomes from server)
              %f     Newsgroup name
              %M     - if newsgroup not allowed for direct post (moderated for example)
              %N     N if newsgroup is new, u if unsubscribed, blank otherwise
              %n     Number of new articles in newsgroup
              %p     Poll: 1 if Mailbox is checked for new mail
              %s     Number of unread articles in newsgroup
              %&gt;X    Right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
              %|X    Pad to the end of the line with character "X"
              %*X    Soft-fill with character "X" as pad

       <b>hdrs</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>unset</u>, the header fields normally added by  the  "my_hdr"  command  are  not  created.   This
              variable  <u>must</u>  be  unset  before composing a new message or replying in order to take effect.  If
              <u>set</u>, the user defined header fields are added to every new message.

       <b>header</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, this variable causes NeoMutt to include the header of the message you  are  replying  to
              into the edit buffer.  The $weed setting applies.

       <b>header_cache</b>
              Type: path
              Default: ""

              This  variable  points  to the header cache database. If the path points to an existing directory,
              NeoMutt will create a dedicated header cache database per folder. Otherwise, the path points to  a
              regular  file,  which  will  be created as needed and used as a shared global header cache for all
              folders.  By default it is <u>unset</u> so no header caching will be used.

              Header caching can greatly improve speed when  opening  POP,  IMAP  MH  or  Maildir  folders,  see
              "caching" in the NeoMutt Guide for details.

       <b>header_cache_backend</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              This variable specifies the header cache backend.  If no backend is specified, the first available
              backend will be used in the following order: tokyocabinet, kyotocabinet, qdbm, rocksdb, gdbm, bdb,
              tdb, lmdb.

       <b>header_cache_compress_level</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 1

              When  NeoMutt is compiled with lz4, zstd or zlib, this option can be used to setup the compression
              level.

       <b>header_cache_compress_method</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              When NeoMutt is compiled with  lz4,  zstd  or  zlib,  the  header  cache  backend  can  use  these
              compression  methods  for  compressing  the  cache files.  This results in much smaller cache file
              sizes and may even improve speed.

       <b>header_color_partial</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, color header regexes behave like color body regexes: color is applied to the exact  text
              matched by the regex.  When <u>unset</u>, color is applied to the entire header.

              One use of this option might be to apply color to just the header labels.

              See "color" for more details.

       <b>help</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  <u>set</u>,  help  lines  describing the bindings for the major functions provided by each menu are
              displayed on the first line of the screen.

              <b>Note:</b> The binding will not be displayed correctly if the function is bound to  a  sequence  rather
              than  a  single  keystroke.   Also, the help line may not be updated if a binding is changed while
              NeoMutt is running.  Since this variable is primarily aimed at new users, neither of these  should
              present a major problem.

       <b>hidden_host</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt will skip the host name part of $hostname variable when adding the domain part
              to addresses.

       <b>hidden_tags</b>
              Type: string list
              Default: "unread,draft,flagged,passed,replied,attachment,signed,encrypted"

              This variable specifies a list of comma-separated private notmuch/imap tags which  should  not  be
              printed on screen.

       <b>hide_limited</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will  not  show  the presence of messages that are hidden by limiting, in the
              thread tree.

       <b>hide_missing</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will not show the presence of missing messages in the thread tree.

       <b>hide_thread_subject</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will not show the subject of messages in the thread  tree  that  have  the  same
              subject as their parent or closest previously displayed sibling.

       <b>hide_top_limited</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt will not show the presence of messages that are hidden by limiting, at the top
              of threads in the thread tree.  Note that when $hide_limited is <u>set</u>,  this  option  will  have  no
              effect.

       <b>hide_top_missing</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will  not  show the presence of missing messages at the top of threads in the
              thread tree.  Note that when $hide_missing is <u>set</u>, this option will have no effect.

       <b>history</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 10

              This variable controls the size (in number of strings remembered) of the string history buffer per
              category. The buffer is cleared each time the variable is set.

              Note that strings (e.g. commands) starting with a space are never recorded in the  history.   This
              is  for  example  useful to prevent leaking sensitive information into the history file or for one
              off tests.

              Also note that a string is  not  added  to  the  history  if  it  exactly  matches  its  immediate
              predecessor,  e.g.  executing the same command twice in a row results in only one copy being added
              to the history.  To prevent duplicates over all entries use $history_remove_dups.

       <b>history_file</b>
              Type: path
              Default: "<a href="file:~/.mutthistory">~/.mutthistory</a>"

              The file in which NeoMutt will save its history.

              Also see $save_history.

       <b>history_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "%s"

              Controls the format of the entries of the history list.  This string is similar to  $index_format,
              but has its own set of <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like sequences:
              %C     Line number
              %s     History match
              %&gt;X    right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
              %|X    pad to the end of the line with character "X"
              %*X    soft-fill with character "X" as pad

       <b>history_remove_dups</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  <u>set</u>,  all  of  the  string history will be scanned for duplicates when a new entry is added.
              Duplicate entries in the $history_file will also be removed when it is periodically compacted.

       <b>honor_disposition</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will not display attachments with a disposition of "attachment" inline  even  if
              it  could  render  the part to plain text. These MIME parts can only be viewed from the attachment
              menu.

              If <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will render all MIME parts it can properly transform to plain text.

       <b>honor_followup_to</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              This variable controls whether or not a Mail-Followup-To header is honored when group-replying  to
              a message.

       <b>hostname</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              Specifies  the  fully-qualified hostname of the system NeoMutt is running on containing the host's
              name and the DNS domain it belongs to. It is used as the domain part (after "@") for  local  email
              addresses.

              If not specified in a config file, then NeoMutt will try to determine the hostname itself.

              Optionally, NeoMutt can be compiled with a fixed domain name.

              Also see $use_domain and $hidden_host.

              <b>Note:</b> On Debian systems, the default for this variable is obtained from /etc/mailname when NeoMutt
              starts.

       <b>idn_decode</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will show you international domain names decoded.  Note: You can use IDNs for
              addresses even if this is <u>unset</u>.  This variable only affects decoding. (IDN only)

       <b>idn_encode</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will encode international domain names using  IDN.   Unset  this  if  your  SMTP
              server can handle newer (RFC6531) UTF-8 encoded domains. (IDN only)

       <b>ignore_list_reply_to</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Affects  the  behavior  of  the  &lt;reply&gt; function when replying to messages from mailing lists (as
              defined by the "subscribe" or "lists" commands).  When <u>set</u>, if the "Reply-To:" field is set to the
              same value as the "To:" field, NeoMutt assumes that the "Reply-To:" field was set by  the  mailing
              list  to  automate responses to the list, and will ignore this field.  To direct a response to the
              mailing list when this option is <u>set</u>, use the &lt;list-reply&gt; function; &lt;group-reply&gt; will  reply  to
              both the sender and the list.

       <b>imap_authenticators</b>
              Type: string list
              Default: ""

              This  is  a colon-separated list of authentication methods NeoMutt may attempt to use to log in to
              an IMAP server, in the order NeoMutt should try them.  Authentication methods are  either  "login"
              or  the  right  side  of  an  IMAP  "AUTH=xxx"  capability  string, e.g. "digest-md5", "gssapi" or
              "cram-md5". This option is case-insensitive. If it's <u>unset</u> (the  default)  NeoMutt  will  try  all
              available methods, in order from most-secure to least-secure.

              Example:

              set imap_authenticators="gssapi:cram-md5:login"

              <b>Note:</b>  NeoMutt  will  only  fall  back to other authentication methods if the previous methods are
              unavailable. If a method is available but authentication fails, NeoMutt will not  connect  to  the
              IMAP server.

       <b>imap_check_subscribed</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will fetch the set of subscribed folders from your server whenever a mailbox is
              <b>selected</b>, and add them to the set of mailboxes it polls for new mail just as  if  you  had  issued
              individual "mailboxes" commands.

       <b>imap_condstore</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will  use  the  CONDSTORE  extension  (RFC7162)  if advertised by the server.
              NeoMutt's current implementation is basic,  used  only  for  initial  message  fetching  and  flag
              updates.

              For  some  IMAP  servers,  enabling  this  will  slightly  speed  up downloading initial messages.
              Unfortunately, Gmail is not one those, and displays worse performance when enabled.  Your  mileage
              may vary.

       <b>imap_deflate</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will use the COMPRESS=DEFLATE extension (RFC4978) if advertised by the server.

              In  general a good compression efficiency can be achieved, which speeds up reading large mailboxes
              also on fairly good connections.

       <b>imap_delim_chars</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "<a href="file:/.">/.</a>"

              This contains the list of characters that NeoMutt will use as folder separators  for  IMAP  paths,
              when no separator is provided on the IMAP connection.

       <b>imap_fetch_chunk_size</b>
              Type: number (long)
              Default: 0

              When  set to a value greater than 0, new headers will be downloaded in groups of this many headers
              per request.  If you have a very large mailbox, this might prevent a timeout and  disconnect  when
              opening  the  mailbox,  by sending a FETCH per set of this many headers, instead of a single FETCH
              for all new headers.

       <b>imap_headers</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              NeoMutt requests these header fields  in  addition  to  the  default  headers  ("Date:",  "From:",
              "Sender:",    "Subject:",    "To:",    "Cc:",   "Message-Id:",   "References:",   "Content-Type:",
              "Content-Description:", "In-Reply-To:", "Reply-To:", "Lines:", "List-Post:", "X-Label:") from IMAP
              servers before displaying the index menu. You may want to add more headers for spam detection.

              <b>Note:</b> This is a space separated list, items should be uppercase and not contain  the  colon,  e.g.
              "X-BOGOSITY X-SPAM-STATUS" for the "X-Bogosity:" and "X-Spam-Status:" header fields.

       <b>imap_idle</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will attempt to use the IMAP IDLE extension to check for new mail in the current
              mailbox.  Some  servers  (dovecot  was  the  inspiration for this option) react badly to NeoMutt's
              implementation. If your connection seems to freeze up periodically, try unsetting this.

       <b>imap_keep_alive</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 300

              This variable specifies the maximum amount of time  in  seconds  that  NeoMutt  will  wait  before
              polling open IMAP connections, to prevent the server from closing them before NeoMutt has finished
              with them. The default is well within the RFC-specified minimum amount of time (30 minutes) before
              a  server  is  allowed  to  do this, but in practice the RFC does get violated every now and then.
              Reduce this number if you find  yourself  getting  disconnected  from  your  IMAP  server  due  to
              inactivity.

       <b>imap_list_subscribed</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This variable configures whether IMAP folder browsing will look for only subscribed folders or all
              folders.  This can be toggled in the IMAP browser with the &lt;toggle-subscribed&gt; function.

       <b>imap_login</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              Your login name on the IMAP server.

              This variable defaults to the value of $imap_user.

       <b>imap_oauth_refresh_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              The command to run to generate an OAUTH refresh token for authorizing your connection to your IMAP
              server.  This command will be run on every connection attempt that uses the OAUTHBEARER or XOAUTH2
              authentication mechanisms.  See "oauth" for details.

       <b>imap_pass</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              Specifies the password for your IMAP account.  If <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will prompt you for your password
              when you invoke the &lt;imap-fetch-mail&gt; function or try to open an IMAP folder.

              <b>Warning</b>:  you  should  only  use  this option when you are on a fairly secure machine, because the
              superuser can read your neomuttrc even if you are the only one who can read the file.

       <b>imap_passive</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will not open new IMAP connections to check for new  mail.   NeoMutt  will  only
              check  for  new  mail  over  existing  IMAP  connections.   This is useful if you don't want to be
              prompted for user/password pairs on NeoMutt invocation, or if opening the connection is slow.

       <b>imap_peek</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will avoid implicitly marking your mail as read whenever  you  fetch  a  message
              from  the  server.  This  is  generally a good thing, but can make closing an IMAP folder somewhat
              slower. This option exists to appease speed freaks.

       <b>imap_pipeline_depth</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 15

              Controls the number of IMAP commands that may be queued up before they are sent to the  server.  A
              deeper  pipeline  reduces  the  amount of time NeoMutt must wait for the server, and can make IMAP
              servers feel much more responsive. But not all servers correctly handle pipelined commands, so  if
              you have problems you might want to try setting this variable to 0.

              <b>Note:</b> Changes to this variable have no effect on open connections.

       <b>imap_poll_timeout</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 15

              This  variable  specifies  the  maximum  amount  of  time  in seconds that NeoMutt will wait for a
              response when polling IMAP connections for new mail, before timing out and closing the connection.
              Set to 0 to disable timing out.

       <b>imap_qresync</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will use the QRESYNC extension (RFC7162) if advertised by the server.  NeoMutt's
              current implementation is basic, used only for initial message fetching and flag updates.

              Note: this feature is currently  experimental.   If  you  experience  strange  behavior,  such  as
              duplicate or missing messages please file a bug report to let us know.

       <b>imap_rfc5161</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will  use  the  IMAP  ENABLE extension (RFC5161) to select CAPABILITIES. Some
              servers (notably Coremail System IMap Server) do not properly respond to  ENABLE  commands,  which
              might cause NeoMutt to hang.  If your connection seems to freeze at login, try unsetting this. See
              also https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/1689

       <b>imap_send_id</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will  send  an  IMAP  ID  command  (RFC2971) to the server when logging in if
              advertised by the server. This command  provides  information  about  the  IMAP  client,  such  as
              "NeoMutt" and the current version.

       <b>imap_server_noise</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will  display  warning messages from the IMAP server as error messages. Since
              these messages are often harmless, or generated due to configuration problems on the server  which
              are out of the users' hands, you may wish to suppress them at some point.

       <b>imap_user</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              The name of the user whose mail you intend to access on the IMAP server.

              This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.

       <b>implicit_auto_view</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If set to "yes", NeoMutt will look for a mailcap entry with the "copiousoutput" flag set for <u>every</u>
              MIME  attachment  it  doesn't  have  an  internal  viewer defined for.  If such an entry is found,
              NeoMutt will use the viewer defined in that entry to convert the body part to text form.

       <b>include</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              Controls whether or not a copy of the message(s) you are replying to is included in your reply.

       <b>include_encrypted</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Controls whether or not NeoMutt includes separately encrypted attachment contents when replying.

              This variable was added to prevent accidental exposure of encrypted contents when replying  to  an
              attacker.   If  a  previously encrypted message were attached by the attacker, they could trick an
              unwary recipient into decrypting and including the message in their reply.

       <b>include_only_first</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Controls whether or not NeoMutt includes  only  the  first  attachment  of  the  message  you  are
              replying.

       <b>indent_string</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "&gt; "

              Specifies  the  string  to  prepend  to  each  line  of  text quoted in a message to which you are
              replying.  You are strongly encouraged not to change this value, as it tends to agitate  the  more
              fanatical netizens.

              The  value  of  this  option  is  ignored if $text_flowed is set, because the quoting mechanism is
              strictly defined for format=flowed.

              This option is a format  string,  please  see  the  description  of  $index_format  for  supported
              <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-style sequences.

       <b>index_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L (%&lt;l?%4l&amp;%4c&gt;) %s"

              This variable allows you to customize the message index display to your personal taste.

              "Format strings" are similar to the strings used in the C function <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3) to format output (see
              the man page for more details).  For an explanation of the %&lt;...&gt; construct, see the status_format
              description.  The following sequences are defined in NeoMutt:
              %a     Address of the author
              %A     Reply-to address (if present; otherwise: address of author)

              %{fmt} the date and time of the message is converted to sender's time zone, and "fmt" is  expanded
                     by  the  library  function  <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3); if the first character inside the braces is a bang
                     ("!"), the date is formatted ignoring any locale settings.  Note  that  the  sender's  time
                     zone  might  only  be  available  as a numerical offset, so "%Z" behaves like "%z".  %{fmt}
                     behaves like %[fmt] on systems where struct tm doesn't have a tm_gmtoff member.
              %[fmt] the date and time of the message is converted to the local time zone, and "fmt" is expanded
                     by the library function <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3); if the first character inside the brackets is  a  bang
                     ("!"), the date is formatted ignoring any locale settings.
              %(fmt) the local date and time when the message was received, and "fmt" is expanded by the library

              %|X    pad to the end of the line with character "X"
              %*X    soft-fill with character "X" as pad

              Date format expressions can be constructed based on relative  dates.  Using  the  date  formatting
              operators  along  with  nested  conditionals,  the  date format can be modified based on how old a
              message is.  See the section on "Conditional Dates" for an explanation and examples

              Note that for mbox/mmdf, "%l" applies to the unprocessed message, and for  maildir/mh,  the  value
              comes  from  the  "Lines:"  header field when present (the meaning is normally the same). Thus the
              value depends on the encodings used in the different parts of the message and has  little  meaning
              in practice.

              "Soft-fill"  deserves  some  explanation:  Normal right-justification will print everything to the
              left of the "%&gt;", displaying padding and whatever lies to the  right  only  if  there's  room.  By
              contrast,  soft-fill  gives  priority to the right-hand side, guaranteeing space to display it and
              showing padding only if there's still room. If necessary, soft-fill will  eat  text  leftwards  to
              make room for rightward text.

              Note that these expandos are supported in "save-hook", "fcc-hook" and "fcc-save-hook", too.

       <b>inews</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              If  set,  specifies  the program and arguments used to deliver news posted by NeoMutt.  Otherwise,
              NeoMutt posts article using  current  connection  to  news  server.   The  following  printf-style
              sequence is understood:
              %a     account url
              %p     port
              %P     port if specified
              %s     news server name
              %S     url schema
              %u     username

              Example:

              set inews="/usr/local/bin/inews -hS"

       <b>ispell</b>
              Type: command
              Default: "ispell"

              How to invoke ispell (GNU's spell-checking software).

       <b>keep_flagged</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If  <u>set</u>,  read  messages marked as flagged will not be moved from your spool mailbox to your $mbox
              mailbox or to the "mbox" specified by a mbox-hook command.

              Note that $keep_flagged only has an effect if $move is set.

       <b>local_date_header</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If <u>set</u>, the date in the Date header of emails that you send will be in  your  local  timezone.  If
              unset a UTC date will be used instead to avoid leaking information about your current location.

       <b>mail_check</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 5

              This  variable  configures  how  often (in seconds) NeoMutt should look for new mail. Also see the
              $timeout variable.

       <b>mail_check_recent</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will only notify you about new mail that has been received since the  last  time
              you  opened  the  mailbox.   When  <u>unset</u>,  NeoMutt  will  notify you if any new mail exists in the
              mailbox, regardless of whether you have visited it recently.

       <b>mail_check_stats</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will periodically calculate message statistics of a mailbox  while  polling  for
              new  mail.   It  will  check for unread, flagged, and total message counts.  (Note: IMAP mailboxes
              only support unread and total counts).

              Because this operation is more performance intensive, it defaults to <u>unset</u>,  and  has  a  separate
              option, $mail_check_stats_interval, to control how often to update these counts.

              Message statistics can also be explicitly calculated by invoking the &lt;check-stats&gt; function.

       <b>mail_check_stats_interval</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 60

              When $mail_check_stats is <u>set</u>, this variable configures how often (in seconds) NeoMutt will update
              message counts.

       <b>mailbox_folder_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "%2C %&lt;n?%6n&amp;      &gt; %6m %i"

              This  variable  allows you to customize the file browser display to your personal taste. It's only
              used to customize network mailboxes (e.g. imap).  This string is identical in  formatting  to  the
              one used by "$folder_format".

       <b>mailcap_path</b>
              Type: string list
              Default: "<a href="file:~/.mailcap">~/.mailcap</a>:/usr/share/neomutt/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:/usr/local/etc/mailcap"

              This variable specifies a list of colon-separated files to consult when attempting to display MIME
              bodies  not directly supported by NeoMutt.  The default value is generated during startup: see the
              "mailcap" section of the manual.

              $mailcap_path is overridden by the environment variable $MAILCAPS.

              The default search path is from RFC1524.

       <b>mailcap_sanitize</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will restrict possible characters in mailcap % expandos to a well-defined  set  of
              safe  characters.   This  is  the  safe  setting,  but  we are not sure it doesn't break some more
              advanced MIME stuff.

              <b>DON'T</b> <b>CHANGE</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>SETTING</b> <b>UNLESS</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>ARE</b> <b>REALLY</b> <b>SURE</b> <b>WHAT</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>ARE</b> <b>DOING!</b>

       <b>maildir_check_cur</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will poll both the new and cur directories of a maildir folder for  new  messages.
              This  might  be useful if other programs interacting with the folder (e.g. dovecot) are moving new
              messages to the cur directory.  Note that setting this  option  may  slow  down  polling  for  new
              messages in large folders, since NeoMutt has to scan all cur messages.

       <b>maildir_field_delimiter</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ":"

              Use  the  value as maildir field delimiter. This is a single-character used to accommodate maildir
              mailboxes on platforms where `:` is not allowed in a filename. The recommended alternative on such
              platforms is `;`.  Neomutt supports all non-alphanumeric values except for  `-`,  `.`,  `\`,  `/`.
              <b>Note:</b>  this  only  applies  to  maildir-style  mailboxes.  Setting it will have no effect on other
              mailbox types.

       <b>maildir_header_cache_verify</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Check for Maildir unaware programs other than NeoMutt  having  modified  maildir  files  when  the
              header  cache  is  in  use.   This  incurs one <a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a>(2) per message every time the folder is opened
              (which can be very slow for NFS folders).

       <b>maildir_trash</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u>, messages marked as deleted will  be  saved  with  the  maildir  trashed  flag  instead  of
              unlinked.   <b>Note:</b> this only applies to maildir-style mailboxes.  Setting it will have no effect on
              other mailbox types.

       <b>mark_macro_prefix</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "'"

              Prefix  for  macros  created  using  mark-message.   A  new  macro  automatically  generated  with
              <u>&lt;mark-message&gt;a</u> will be composed from this prefix and the letter <u>a</u>.

       <b>mark_old</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls  whether  or  not  NeoMutt marks <u>new</u> <b>unread</b> messages as <u>old</u> if you exit a mailbox without
              reading them.  With this option <u>set</u>, the next time you start NeoMutt, the messages  will  show  up
              with an "O" next to them in the index menu, indicating that they are old.

       <b>markers</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls  the display of wrapped lines in the internal pager. If set, a "+" marker is displayed at
              the beginning of wrapped lines.

              Also see the $smart_wrap variable.

       <b>mask</b>
              Type: regular expression
              Default: "!^\.[^.]"

              A regular expression used in the file browser, optionally preceded by the <u>not</u> operator "!".   Only
              files whose names match this mask will be shown. The match is always case-sensitive.

       <b>mbox</b>
              Type: mailbox
              Default: "<a href="file:~/mbox">~/mbox</a>"

              This specifies the folder into which read mail in your $spool_file folder will be appended.

              Also see the $move variable.

       <b>mbox_type</b>
              Type: enumeration
              Default: mbox

              The  default  mailbox  type  used when creating new folders. May be any of "mbox", "MMDF", "MH" or
              "Maildir".

              This can also be set using the -m command-line option.

       <b>me_too</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will remove your address  (see  the  "alternates"  command)  from  the  list  of
              recipients when replying to a message.

       <b>menu_context</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              This variable controls the number of lines of context that are given when scrolling through menus.
              (Similar to $pager_context.)

       <b>menu_move_off</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  <u>unset</u>,  the bottom entry of menus will never scroll up past the bottom of the screen, unless
              there are less entries than lines.  When <u>set</u>, the bottom entry may move off the bottom.

       <b>menu_scroll</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, menus will be scrolled up or down one line when you attempt  to  move  across  a  screen
              boundary.   If <u>unset</u>, the screen is cleared and the next or previous page of the menu is displayed
              (useful for slow links to avoid many redraws).

       <b>message_cache_clean</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will clean out obsolete entries  from  the  message  cache  when  the  mailbox  is
              synchronized.  You  probably  only  want to set it every once in a while, since it can be a little
              slow (especially for large folders).

       <b>message_cache_dir</b>
              Type: path
              Default: ""

              Set this to a directory and NeoMutt will cache copies of messages from your IMAP and  POP  servers
              here. You are free to remove entries at any time.

              When  setting  this variable to a directory, NeoMutt needs to fetch every remote message only once
              and can perform regular expression searches as fast as for local folders.

              Also see the $message_cache_clean variable.

       <b>message_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "%s"

              This is the string displayed in the "attachment" menu for attachments of type message/rfc822.  For
              a full listing of defined <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like sequences see the section on $index_format.

       <b>meta_key</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u>, forces NeoMutt to interpret keystrokes with the high bit (bit 8) set as if  the  user  had
              pressed  the  Esc key and whatever key remains after having the high bit removed.  For example, if
              the key pressed has an ASCII value of 0xf8, then this is treated as if the user  had  pressed  Esc
              then  "x".   This  is  because the result of removing the high bit from 0xf8 is 0x78, which is the
              ASCII character "x".

       <b>mh_purge</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will mimic mh's behavior and rename deleted messages to <u>,&lt;old</u> <u>file</u> <u>name&gt;</u> in mh
              folders instead of really deleting them. This leaves  the  message  on  disk  but  makes  programs
              reading the folder ignore it. If the variable is <u>set</u>, the message files will simply be deleted.

              This option is similar to $maildir_trash for Maildir folders.

       <b>mh_seq_flagged</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "flagged"

              The name of the MH sequence used for flagged messages.

       <b>mh_seq_replied</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "replied"

              The name of the MH sequence used to tag replied messages.

       <b>mh_seq_unseen</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "unseen"

              The name of the MH sequence used for unseen messages.

       <b>mime_forward</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: no

              When  <u>set</u>,  the message you are forwarding will be attached as a separate message/rfc822 MIME part
              instead of included in the main body of the message.  This is useful for forwarding MIME  messages
              so  the  receiver  can properly view the message as it was delivered to you. If you like to switch
              between MIME and not MIME from mail to mail, set this variable to "ask-no" or "ask-yes".

              Also see $forward_decode and $mime_forward_decode.

       <b>mime_forward_decode</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into text/plain when  forwarding  a  message  while
              $mime_forward is <u>set</u>. Otherwise $forward_decode is used instead.

       <b>mime_forward_rest</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              When forwarding multiple attachments of a MIME message from the attachment menu, attachments which
              can't  be  decoded  in  a reasonable manner will be attached to the newly composed message if this
              option is <u>set</u>.

       <b>mime_type_query_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This specifies a command to run, to determine the mime type of a new attachment when  composing  a
              message.   Unless  $mime_type_query_first  is  set,  this  will  only  be  run if the attachment's
              extension is not found in the mime.types file.

              The string may contain a "%s", which will be substituted with the  attachment  filename.   NeoMutt
              will  add  quotes  around the string substituted for "%s" automatically according to shell quoting
              rules, so you should avoid adding your own.  If no "%s" is  found  in  the  string,  NeoMutt  will
              append the attachment filename to the end of the string.

              The command should output a single line containing the attachment's mime type.

              Suggested values are "xdg-mime query filetype" or "file -bi".

       <b>mime_type_query_first</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, the $mime_type_query_command will be run before the mime.types lookup.

       <b>move</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: no

              If  this  variable  is  <u>set</u>,  then NeoMutt will move read messages from your spool mailbox to your
              $mbox mailbox or to the "mbox" specified by a mbox-hook command.

              See also $keep_flagged.

       <b>narrow_tree</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This variable, when <u>set</u>, makes the thread tree narrower, allowing deeper threads  to  fit  on  the
              screen.

       <b>net_inc</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 10

              Operations  that  expect  to  transfer  a  large amount of data over the network will update their
              progress every $net_inc kilobytes.  If set to 0, no progress messages will be displayed.

              See also $read_inc, $write_inc and $net_inc.

       <b>new_mail_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              If <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will call this command after a new message is received.   See  the  $status_format
              documentation for the values that can be formatted into this command.

       <b>news_cache_dir</b>
              Type: path
              Default: "<a href="file:~/.neomutt">~/.neomutt</a>"

              This  variable  pointing to directory where NeoMutt will save cached news articles and headers in.
              If <u>unset</u>, articles and headers will not be saved at all and will be reloaded from the server  each
              time.

       <b>news_server</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              This variable specifies domain name or address of NNTP server.

              You   can   also   specify   username   and  an  alternative  port  for  each  news  server,  e.g.
              [[s]news://][username[:password]@]server[:port]

              This option can also be  set  using  the  command  line  option  "-g",  the  environment  variable
              $NNTPSERVER, or putting the server name in the file "/etc/nntpserver".

       <b>newsgroups_charset</b>

       <b>nm_exclude_tags</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              The messages tagged with these tags are excluded and not loaded from notmuch DB to NeoMutt  unless
              specified explicitly.

       <b>nm_flagged_tag</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "flagged"

              This  variable  specifies  notmuch tag which is used for flagged messages. The variable is used to
              count flagged messages in DB and set the flagged flag  when  modifying  tags.  All  other  NeoMutt

       <b>nm_query_window_current_search</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              This variable contains the currently setup notmuch search for window based vfolder.

       <b>nm_query_window_duration</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              This  variable  sets  the  time  duration  of  a  windowed notmuch query.  Accepted values all non
              negative integers. A value of 0 disables the feature.

       <b>nm_query_window_enable</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This variable enables windowed notmuch queries even if window duration is 0.

       <b>nm_query_window_or_terms</b>

              terms, NeoMutt will produce a query window such as:

              notmuch://?query=tag:inbox and (date:... or (tag:flagged and tag:unread))

       <b>nm_query_window_timebase</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "week"

              This variable sets the time base of a windowed  notmuch  query.   Accepted  values  are  'minute',
              'hour', 'day', 'week', 'month', 'year'

       <b>nm_record</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This  variable  specifies  whether,  when  writing a just-sent message to the $record, the message
              should also be added to the notmuch DB.  Replies  inherit  the  notmuch  tags  from  the  original
              message.  See  $nm_record_tags for how to modify the set of notmuch tags assigned to sent messages
              written to the record.

       <b>nm_record_tags</b>

              Default: "replied"

              This variable specifies notmuch tag which is used for replied messages. The variable  is  used  to
              set  the  replied flag when modifying tags. All other NeoMutt commands use standard (e.g. maildir)
              flags.

       <b>nm_unread_tag</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "unread"

              This variable specifies notmuch tag which is used for unread messages. The  variable  is  used  to
              count  unread  messages  in  DB  and  set  the  unread flag when modifying tags. All other NeoMutt
              commands use standard (e.g. maildir) flags.

       <b>nntp_authenticators</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods NeoMutt may attempt to use to log in to a
              news server, in the order NeoMutt should try them.  Authentication methods are  either  "user"  or
              any  SASL  mechanism, e.g. "digest-md5", "gssapi" or "cram-md5".  This option is case-insensitive.
              If it's <u>unset</u> (the default) NeoMutt will try all available methods, in order from  most-secure  to
              least-secure.

              Example:

              set nntp_authenticators="digest-md5:user"

              <b>Note:</b>  NeoMutt  will  only  fall  back to other authentication methods if the previous methods are
              unavailable. If a method is available but authentication fails, NeoMutt will not  connect  to  the
              IMAP server.

       <b>nntp_context</b>
              Type: number (long)
              Default: 1000

              This variable defines number of articles which will be in index when newsgroup entered.  If active
              newsgroup have more articles than this number, oldest articles will be ignored.  Also controls how
              many articles headers will be saved in cache when you quit newsgroup.

       <b>nntp_listgroup</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This  variable  controls  whether  or  not  existence of each article is checked when newsgroup is
              entered.

       <b>nntp_load_description</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This variable controls whether or  not  descriptions  for  each  newsgroup  must  be  loaded  when
              newsgroup is added to list (first time list loading or new newsgroup adding).

       <b>nntp_pass</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              Your password for NNTP account.

       <b>nntp_poll</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 60

              The  time  in seconds until any operations on newsgroup except post new article will cause recheck
              for new news.  If set to 0, NeoMutt will recheck newsgroup on each operation in  index  (stepping,
              read article, etc.).

       <b>nntp_user</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              Your  login  name  on  the NNTP server.  If <u>unset</u> and NNTP server requires authentication, NeoMutt
              will prompt you for your account name when you connect to news server.

       <b>pager</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This variable specifies which pager you would like to use to view messages.  When  empty,  NeoMutt
              will  use  the built-in pager, otherwise this variable should specify the pathname of the external
              pager you would like to use.

              Using an external pager may have some disadvantages: Additional keystrokes are  necessary  because
              you  can't  call  NeoMutt functions directly from the pager, and screen resizes cause lines longer
              than the screen width to be badly formatted in the help menu.

       <b>pager_context</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              This variable controls the number of lines of context that are given when displaying the  next  or
              previous page in the internal pager.  By default, NeoMutt will display the line after the last one
              on the screen at the top of the next page (0 lines of context).

              This  variable  also  specifies  the amount of context given for search results. If positive, this
              many lines will be given before a match, if 0, the match will be top-aligned.

       <b>pager_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "-%Z- %C/%m: %-20.20n   %s%*  -- (%P)"

              This variable controls the format of the one-line message "status" displayed before  each  message
              in  either the internal or an external pager.  The valid sequences are listed in the $index_format
              section.

       <b>pager_index_lines</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              Determines the number of lines of a mini-index which is shown when  in  the  pager.   The  current
              message,  unless  near  the top or bottom of the folder, will be roughly one third of the way down
              this mini-index, giving the reader the context of a few messages before  and  after  the  message.
              This  is  useful,  for  example,  to  determine how many messages remain to be read in the current
              thread.  A value of 0 results in no index being shown.

       <b>pager_read_delay</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              Determines the number of seconds that must elapse after first opening a new message in  the  pager
              before that message will be marked as read.  A value of 0 results in the message being marked read
              unconditionally;  for  other values, navigating to another message or exiting the pager before the
              timeout will leave the message marked unread.  This setting is ignored if $pager is set.

       <b>pager_skip_quoted_context</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              Determines the number of lines of context  to  show  before  the  unquoted  text  when  using  the
              &lt;skip-quoted&gt;  function.  When  set  to  a positive number at most that many lines of the previous
              quote are displayed. If the previous quote is shorter the whole quote is displayed.

              The (now deprecated) <u>skip_quoted_offset</u> is an alias for this variable, and  should  no  longer  be
              used.

       <b>pager_stop</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  <u>set</u>,  the  internal-pager  will  <b>not</b>  move  to the next message when you are at the end of a
              message and invoke the &lt;next-page&gt; function.

       <b>pattern_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "%2n %-15e  %d"

              This variable describes the format of the "pattern completion" menu. The following <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-style
              sequences are understood:
              %d     pattern description
              %e     pattern expression
              %n     index number
              %&gt;X    right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
              %|X    pad to the end of the line with character "X"
              %*X    soft-fill with character "X" as pad

       <b>pgp_auto_decode</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will automatically attempt to decrypt traditional PGP messages whenever  the  user
              performs  an operation which ordinarily would result in the contents of the message being operated
              on.  For example, if the user displays a pgp-traditional  message  which  has  not  been  manually
              checked  with  the  &lt;check-traditional-pgp&gt; function, NeoMutt will automatically check the message
              for traditional pgp.

       <b>pgp_auto_inline</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This option controls whether NeoMutt generates old-style inline  (traditional)  PGP  encrypted  or
              signed  messages under certain circumstances.  This can be overridden by use of the pgp menu, when
              inline is not required.  The GPGME backend does not support this option.

              Note that NeoMutt might automatically use PGP/MIME for messages  which  consist  of  more  than  a
              single  MIME  part.  NeoMutt can be configured to ask before sending PGP/MIME messages when inline
              (traditional) would not work.

              Also see the $pgp_mime_auto variable.

              Also note that using the old-style PGP message format is <b>strongly</b> <b>deprecated</b>.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_check_exit</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will check the exit code of the PGP subprocess  when  signing  or  encrypting.   A
              non-zero exit code means that the subprocess failed.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_check_gpg_decrypt_status_fd</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will  check  the  status  file  descriptor  output  of $pgp_decrypt_command and
              $pgp_decode_command for GnuPG status codes indicating successful decryption.  This will check  for
              the  presence  of  DECRYPTION_OKAY,  absence  of  DECRYPTION_FAILED, and that all PLAINTEXT occurs
              between the BEGIN_DECRYPTION and END_DECRYPTION status codes.

              If <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will instead match the status  fd  output  against  $pgp_decryption_okay.   (PGP
              only)

       <b>pgp_clear_sign_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This  format  is used to create an old-style "clearsigned" PGP message.  Note that the use of this
              format is <b>strongly</b> <b>deprecated</b>.

              This is  a  format  string,  see  the  $pgp_decode_command  command  for  possible  <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like
              sequences.   Note  that  in  this case, %r expands to the search string, which is a list of one or
              more quoted values such as email address, name, or keyid.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_decode_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This format strings specifies a command which is used to decode application/pgp attachments.

              The PGP command formats have their own set of <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like sequences:
              %a     The value of $pgp_sign_as if set, otherwise the value of $pgp_default_key.
              %f     Expands to the name of a file containing a message.
              %p     Expands to PGPPASSFD=0 when a pass phrase is needed, to an empty  string  otherwise.  Note:
                     This may be used with a %&lt;...&gt; construct.
              %r     One or more key IDs (or fingerprints if available).
              %s     Expands  to  the  name  of  a  file  containing  the  signature  part of a multipart/signed
                     attachment when verifying it.

              (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_decrypt_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This command is used to decrypt a PGP encrypted message.

              This is  a  format  string,  see  the  $pgp_decode_command  command  for  possible  <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like
              sequences.  (PGP only)

              Note:  When  decrypting  messages  using  gpg,  a  pinentry program needs to be invoked unless the
              password is cached within gpg-agent.  Currently, the  pinentry-tty  program  (usually  distributed
              with  gpg)  isn't  suitable  for  being invoked by NeoMutt.  You are encouraged to use a different
              pinentry-program when running NeoMutt in order to avoid problems.

              See also: https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/1014

       <b>pgp_decryption_okay</b>
              Type: regular expression
              Default: ""

              If you assign text to this variable, then an encrypted PGP message is only considered successfully
              decrypted if the output from $pgp_decrypt_command contains the text.   This  is  used  to  protect
              against  a spoofed encrypted message, with multipart/encrypted headers but containing a block that
              is not actually encrypted.  (e.g. simply signed and ascii armored text).

              Note that if $pgp_check_gpg_decrypt_status_fd is set, this variable is ignored.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_default_key</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              This is the default key-pair to use for PGP operations.  It  will  be  used  for  encryption  (see
              $postpone_encrypt and $pgp_self_encrypt).

              It will also be used for signing unless $pgp_sign_as is set.

              The  (now  deprecated)  <u>pgp_self_encrypt_as</u> is an alias for this variable, and should no longer be
              used.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_encrypt_only_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This command is used to encrypt a body part without signing it.

              This is  a  format  string,  see  the  $pgp_decode_command  command  for  possible  <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like
              sequences.   Note  that  in  this case, %r expands to the search string, which is a list of one or
              more quoted values such as email address, name, or keyid.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_encrypt_sign_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This command is used to both sign and encrypt a body part.

              This is  a  format  string,  see  the  $pgp_decode_command  command  for  possible  <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like
              sequences.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_entry_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "%4n %t%f %4l/0x%k %-4a %2c %u"

              This  variable  allows  you  to  customize  the  PGP key selection menu to your personal taste. If
              $crypt_use_gpgme is <u>set</u>, then it applies to S/MIME key selection menu also. This string is similar
              to $index_format, but has its own set of <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like sequences:
              %a     Algorithm
              %c     Capabilities

              %u     User id
              %[&lt;s&gt;] Date of the key where &lt;s&gt; is an <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3) expression
              %&gt;X    Right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
              %|X    Pad to the end of the line with character "X"
              %*X    Soft-fill with character "X" as pad

              See the section "Sending Cryptographically Signed/Encrypted Messages" of the user manual  for  the
              meaning of the letters some of these sequences expand to.

              (Crypto only) or (PGP only when GPGME disabled)

       <b>pgp_export_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This command is used to export a public key from the user's key ring.

              This  is  a  format  string,  see  the  $pgp_decode_command  command  for  possible <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like
              sequences.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_get_keys_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This command is invoked whenever NeoMutt needs to fetch the public key associated  with  an  email
              address.   Of  the  sequences  supported  by  $pgp_decode_command,  %r  is the only <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like
              sequence used with this format.  Note that in this case, %r expands to the email address, not  the
              public key ID (the key ID is unknown, which is why NeoMutt is invoking this command).  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_good_sign</b>
              Type: regular expression
              Default: ""

              If  you  assign  a  text to this variable, then a PGP signature is only considered verified if the
              output from $pgp_verify_command contains the text. Use this variable if the  exit  code  from  the
              command is 0 even for bad signatures.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_ignore_subkeys</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Setting  this  variable  will  cause NeoMutt to ignore OpenPGP subkeys. Instead, the principal key
              will inherit the subkeys' capabilities.  <u>Unset</u> this if you want to play interesting key  selection
              games.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_import_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This command is used to import a key from a message into the user's public key ring.

              This  is  a  format  string,  see  the  $pgp_decode_command  command  for  possible <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like
              sequences.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_list_pubring_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This command is used to list the public key ring's contents.  The output format must be  analogous
              to the one used by

              gpg --list-keys --with-colons --with-fingerprint

              Note:  gpg's fixed-list-mode option should not be used.  It produces a different date format which
              may result in NeoMutt showing incorrect key generation dates.

              This is  a  format  string,  see  the  $pgp_decode_command  command  for  possible  <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like
              sequences.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_list_secring_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This  command is used to list the secret key ring's contents.  The output format must be analogous
              to the one used by:

              gpg --list-keys --with-colons --with-fingerprint

              Note: gpg's fixed-list-mode option should not be used.  It produces a different date format  which
              may result in NeoMutt showing incorrect key generation dates.

              This  is  a  format  string,  see  the  $pgp_decode_command  command  for  possible <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like
              sequences.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_key_sort</b>
              Type: sort order
              Default: address

              Specifies how the entries in the pgp menu are sorted. The following are legal values:
              address
                     sort alphabetically by user id
              keyid  sort alphabetically by key id
              date   sort by key creation date
              trust  sort by the trust of the key

              If you prefer reverse order of the above values, prefix it with "reverse-".  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_long_ids</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If <u>set</u>, use 64 bit PGP key IDs, if <u>unset</u> use the normal 32 bit key IDs.  NOTE: Internally, NeoMutt
              has transitioned to using fingerprints (or long key IDs as a  fallback).   This  option  now  only
              controls the display of key IDs in the key selection menu and a few other places.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_mime_auto</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              This   option   controls   whether   NeoMutt   will   prompt   you  for  automatically  sending  a
              (signed/encrypted) message using PGP/MIME when inline (traditional) fails (for any reason).

              Also note that using the old-style PGP message format is <b>strongly</b> <b>deprecated</b>.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_reply_inline</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Setting this variable will cause NeoMutt to always  attempt  to  create  an  inline  (traditional)
              message  when  replying to a message which is PGP encrypted/signed inline.  This can be overridden
              by use of the pgp menu, when inline is not required.  This option does not automatically detect if
              the (replied-to) message is  inline;  instead  it  relies  on  NeoMutt  internals  for  previously
              checked/flagged messages.

              Note  that  NeoMutt  might  automatically  use  PGP/MIME for messages which consist of more than a
              single MIME part.  NeoMutt can be configured to ask before sending PGP/MIME messages  when  inline
              (traditional) would not work.

              Also see the $pgp_mime_auto variable.

              Also note that using the old-style PGP message format is <b>strongly</b> <b>deprecated</b>.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_retainable_sigs</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If   <u>set</u>,   signed   and   encrypted   messages   will  consist  of  nested  multipart/signed  and
              multipart/encrypted body parts.

              This is useful for applications like encrypted and signed mailing lists,  where  the  outer  layer
              (multipart/encrypted)  can  be  easily removed, while the inner multipart/signed part is retained.
              (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_self_encrypt</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, PGP encrypted messages will also be encrypted using the key in  $pgp_default_key.   (PGP
              only)

       <b>pgp_show_unusable</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will display non-usable keys on the PGP key selection menu.  This includes keys
              which have been revoked, have expired, or have been marked as "disabled" by the user.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_sign_as</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              If you have a different key pair to use for signing, you should set this to the signing key.  Most
              people will only need to set $pgp_default_key.  It is recommended that you use the keyid  form  to
              specify your key (e.g. 0x00112233).  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_sign_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This  command  is  used  to create the detached PGP signature for a multipart/signed PGP/MIME body
              part.

              This is  a  format  string,  see  the  $pgp_decode_command  command  for  possible  <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like
              sequences.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_strict_enc</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will automatically encode PGP/MIME signed messages as quoted-printable.  Please
              note that unsetting this variable may lead to problems with non-verifyable PGP signatures, so only
              change this if you know what you are doing.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_timeout</b>
              Type: number (long)
              Default: 300

              The number of seconds after which a cached passphrase will expire if not used.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_use_gpg_agent</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If <u>set</u>, NeoMutt expects a <a href="../man1/gpg-agent.1.html">gpg-agent</a>(1) process will handle private  key  passphrase  prompts.   If
              <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will prompt for the passphrase and pass it via stdin to the pgp command.

              Note  that  as  of version 2.1, GnuPG automatically spawns an agent and requires the agent be used
              for passphrase management.  Since that  version  is  increasingly  prevalent,  this  variable  now
              defaults <u>set</u>.

              NeoMutt works with a GUI or curses pinentry program.  A TTY pinentry should not be used.

              If you are using an older version of GnuPG without an agent running, or another encryption program
              without an agent, you will need to <u>unset</u> this variable.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_verify_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This command is used to verify PGP signatures.

              This  is  a  format  string,  see  the  $pgp_decode_command  command  for  possible <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like
              sequences.  (PGP only)

       <b>pgp_verify_key_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This command is used to verify key information from the key selection menu.

              This is  a  format  string,  see  the  $pgp_decode_command  command  for  possible  <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like
              sequences.  (PGP only)

       <b>pipe_decode</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Used  in  connection with the &lt;pipe-message&gt; function.  When <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will pipe the messages
              without any preprocessing. When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will attempt to decode the messages first.

              Also see $pipe_decode_weed, which controls whether headers will be weeded when this is <u>set</u>.

       <b>pipe_decode_weed</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              For &lt;pipe-message&gt;, when $pipe_decode is set, this further  controls  whether  NeoMutt  will  weed
              headers.

       <b>pipe_sep</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "\n"

              The  separator  to  add between messages when piping a list of tagged messages to an external Unix
              command.

       <b>pipe_split</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Used in connection with the &lt;pipe-message&gt; function following &lt;tag-prefix&gt;.  If this  variable  is
              <u>unset</u>,  when  piping a list of tagged messages NeoMutt will concatenate the messages and will pipe
              them all concatenated.  When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will pipe the messages one by one.  In  both  cases  the
              messages  are  piped  in the current sorted order, and the $pipe_sep separator is added after each
              message.

       <b>pop_auth_try_all</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will try all available authentication methods.  When <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will only fall
              back to other authentication methods if the previous methods  are  unavailable.  If  a  method  is
              available but authentication fails, NeoMutt will not connect to the POP server.

       <b>pop_authenticators</b>
              Type: string list
              Default: ""

              This  is  a colon-separated list of authentication methods NeoMutt may attempt to use to log in to
              an POP server, in the order NeoMutt should try them.  Authentication methods  are  either  "user",
              "apop"  or  any  SASL  mechanism,  e.g.  "digest-md5",  "gssapi"  or  "cram-md5".   This option is
              case-insensitive. If this option is <u>unset</u> (the default) NeoMutt will try all available methods, in
              order from most-secure to least-secure.

              Example:

              set pop_authenticators="digest-md5:apop:user"

       <b>pop_check_interval</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 60

              This variable configures how often (in seconds) NeoMutt should look for new mail in the  currently
              selected mailbox if it is a POP mailbox.

       <b>pop_delete</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-no

              If  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will delete successfully downloaded messages from the POP server when using the
              &lt;fetch-mail&gt; function.  When <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will download messages but also leave them on the  POP
              server.

       <b>pop_host</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              The  name  of  your POP server for the &lt;fetch-mail&gt; function.  You can also specify an alternative
              port, username and password, i.e.:

              [pop[s]://][username[:password]@]popserver[:port]

              where "[...]" denotes an optional part.

       <b>pop_last</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If this variable is <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will try to use the "LAST" POP command for retrieving only unread
              messages from the POP server when using the &lt;fetch-mail&gt; function.

       <b>pop_oauth_refresh_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              The command to run to generate an OAUTH refresh token for authorizing your connection to your  POP
              server.   This  command  will  be  run  on  every  connection  attempt  that  uses the OAUTHBEARER
              authentication mechanism.  See "oauth" for details.

       <b>pop_pass</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              Specifies the password for your POP account.  If <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will prompt you for your  password
              when you open a POP mailbox.

              <b>Warning</b>:  you  should  only  use  this option when you are on a fairly secure machine, because the
              superuser can read your neomuttrc even if you are the only one who can read the file.

       <b>pop_reconnect</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              Controls whether or not NeoMutt will try to reconnect to the POP server if the connection is lost.

       <b>pop_user</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              Your login name on the POP server.

              This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.

       <b>post_moderated</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              If set to <u>yes</u>, NeoMutt will post article to newsgroup that have not permissions to  posting  (e.g.
              moderated).  <b>Note:</b> if news server does not support posting to that newsgroup or totally read-only,
              that posting will not have an effect.

       <b>postpone</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              Controls  whether  or  not messages are saved in the $postponed mailbox when you elect not to send
              immediately. If set to <u>ask-yes</u> or <u>ask-no</u>,  you  will  be  prompted  with  "Save  (postpone)  draft
              message?" when quitting from the "compose" screen.

              Also see the $recall variable.

       <b>postpone_encrypt</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  <u>set</u>, postponed messages that are marked for encryption will be self-encrypted.  NeoMutt will
              first try to encrypt using the value specified  in  $pgp_default_key  or  $smime_default_key.   If
              those are not set, it will try the deprecated $postpone_encrypt_as.  (Crypto only)

       <b>postpone_encrypt_as</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              This  is  a  deprecated  fall-back variable for $postpone_encrypt.  Please use $pgp_default_key or
              $smime_default_key.  (Crypto only)

       <b>postponed</b>
              Type: mailbox
              Default: "<a href="file:~/postponed">~/postponed</a>"

              NeoMutt allows you to indefinitely "postpone sending a message" which you are editing.   When  you
              choose to postpone a message, NeoMutt saves it in the mailbox specified by this variable.

              Also see the $postpone variable.

       <b>preconnect</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              If  <u>set</u>,  a shell command to be executed if NeoMutt fails to establish a connection to the server.
              This is useful for setting up secure connections, e.g. with  <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a>(1).  If  the  command  returns  a
              nonzero status, NeoMutt gives up opening the server. Example:

              set preconnect="ssh -f -q -L 1234:mailhost.net:143 mailhost.net \
              sleep 20 &lt; /dev/null &gt; /dev/null"

              Mailbox "foo" on "mailhost.net" can now be reached as "{localhost:1234}foo".

              Note: For this example to work, you must be able to log in to the remote machine without having to
              enter a password.

       <b>preferred_languages</b>
              Type: string list
              Default: ""

              This  variable  specifies a list of comma-separated languages.  RFC8255 : user preferred languages
              to be searched in parts and display.  Example:

              set preferred_languages="en,fr,de"

       <b>print</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-no

              Controls whether or not NeoMutt really prints messages.  This  is  set  to  "ask-no"  by  default,
              because some people accidentally hit "p" often.

       <b>print_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: "lpr"

              This specifies the command pipe that should be used to print messages.

       <b>print_decode</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Used  in  connection  with  the  &lt;print-message&gt;  function.  If this option is <u>set</u>, the message is
              decoded before it is passed to the external command specified by $print_command.  If  this  option
              is  <u>unset</u>,  no processing will be applied to the message when printing it.  The latter setting may
              be useful if you are using some advanced printer filter which is able to  properly  format  e-mail
              messages for printing.

              Also see $print_decode_weed, which controls whether headers will be weeded when this is <u>set</u>.

       <b>print_decode_weed</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              For  &lt;print-message&gt;,  when  $print_decode is set, this further controls whether NeoMutt will weed
              headers.

       <b>print_split</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Used in connection with the  &lt;print-message&gt;  function.   If  this  option  is  <u>set</u>,  the  command
              specified  by  $print_command  is  executed once for each message which is to be printed.  If this
              option is <u>unset</u>, the command specified by $print_command  is  executed  only  once,  and  all  the
              messages are concatenated, with a form feed as the message separator.

              Those  who  use  the  <a href="../man1/enscript.1.html">enscript</a>(1)  program's  mail-printing mode will most likely want to <u>set</u> this
              option.

       <b>prompt_after</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If you use an <u>external</u> $pager, setting this variable will  cause  NeoMutt  to  prompt  you  for  a
              command  when  the  pager  exits  rather than returning to the index menu.  If <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will
              return to the index menu when the external pager exits.

       <b>query_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This specifies the command NeoMutt will use to make external  address  queries.   The  string  may
              contain  a "%s", which will be substituted with the query string the user types.  NeoMutt will add
              quotes around the string substituted for "%s" automatically according to shell quoting  rules,  so
              you  should  avoid  adding  your  own.  If no "%s" is found in the string, NeoMutt will append the
              user's      query      to      the      end      of      the      string.        See       "query"
              (https://neomutt.org/guide/advancedusage.html#query) for more information.

       <b>query_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "%3i %t %-25N %-25E | %C%&gt; %Y"

              This  variable  describes  the format of the "query" menu. The following <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-style sequences
              are understood:
              %A     Full Address (Name and Email)
              %C     Comment
              %E     Email Address
              %i     Index number
              %N     Real name
              %t     Alias is tagged (selected)
              %Y     User-defined tags (labels)
              %&gt;X    Right justify the rest of the string and pad with "X"
              %|X    Pad to the end of the line with "X"
              %*X    Soft-fill with character "X" as pad

              For an explanation of "soft-fill", see the $index_format documentation.

              The following sequences are deprecated; they will be removed in the future.
              %a     Use %E instead
              %c     Use %i instead
              %e     Use %C instead
              %n     Use %N instead

       <b>quit</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              This variable controls whether "quit" and "exit" actually quit from NeoMutt.  If  this  option  is
              <u>set</u>, they do quit, if it is <u>unset</u>, they have no effect, and if it is set to <u>ask-yes</u> or <u>ask-no</u>, you
              are prompted for confirmation when you try to quit.

              In  order  to  quit  from  NeoMutt  if  this variable is <u>unset</u>, you must send the signal SIGINT to
              NeoMutt.  This can usually be achieved by pressing CTRL-C in the terminal.

       <b>quote_regex</b>
              Type: regular expression
              Default: "^([ \t]*[|&gt;:}#])+"

              A regular expression used in the internal pager to determine quoted sections of text in  the  body
              of  a  message.  Quoted  text  may  be  filtered out using the &lt;toggle-quoted&gt; command, or colored
              according to the "color quoted" family of directives.

              Higher levels of quoting may be colored differently ("color quoted1", "color quoted2", etc.).  The
              quoting  level  is determined by removing the last character from the matched text and recursively
              reapplying the regular expression until it fails to produce a match.

              Match detection may be overridden by the $smileys regular expression.

       <b>read_inc</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 10

              If set to a value greater than 0, NeoMutt will display which  message  it  is  currently  on  when
              reading  a  mailbox  or  when  performing  search actions such as search and limit. The message is
              printed after this many messages have been read or searched (e.g., if  set  to  25,  NeoMutt  will
              print  a  message  when  it  is  at  message 25, and then again when it gets to message 50).  This
              variable is meant to indicate progress when reading or searching large mailboxes  which  may  take
              some time.  When set to 0, only a single message will appear before the reading the mailbox.

              Also  see  the $write_inc, $net_inc and $time_inc variables and the "tuning" section of the manual
              for performance considerations.

       <b>read_only</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u>, all folders are opened in read-only mode.

       <b>real_name</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              This variable specifies what "real" or "personal" name should be used when sending messages.

              If not specified, then the user's "real name" will be read from /etc/passwd.  This option will not
              be used, if "$from" is set.

       <b>recall</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              Controls whether or not NeoMutt recalls postponed messages when composing a new message.

              Setting this variable to <u>yes</u> is not generally useful, and thus not  recommended.   Note  that  the
              &lt;recall-message&gt; function can be used to manually recall postponed messages.

              Also see $postponed variable.

       <b>record</b>
              Type: mailbox
              Default: "<a href="file:~/sent">~/sent</a>"

              This  specifies  the file into which your outgoing messages should be appended.  (This is meant as
              the primary method for saving a copy of your messages, but another way to do  this  is  using  the
              "my_hdr" command to create a "Bcc:" field with your email address in it.)

              The value of <u>$record</u> is overridden by the $force_name and $save_name variables, and the "fcc-hook"
              command.  Also see $copy and $write_bcc.

       <b>reflow_space_quotes</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This  option  controls  how quotes from format=flowed messages are displayed in the pager and when
              replying (with $text_flowed <u>unset</u>).  When set, this option adds spaces after each level  of  quote
              marks, turning "&gt;&gt;&gt;foo" into "&gt; &gt; &gt; foo".

              <b>Note:</b>  If  $reflow_text  is  <u>unset</u>,  this option has no effect.  Also, this option does not affect
              replies when $text_flowed is <u>set</u>.

       <b>reflow_text</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will reformat paragraphs in text/plain parts marked  format=flowed.   If  <u>unset</u>,
              NeoMutt  will  display paragraphs unaltered from how they appear in the message body.  See RFC3676
              for details on the <u>format=flowed</u> format.

              Also see $reflow_wrap, and $wrap.

       <b>reflow_wrap</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 78

              This variable controls the  maximum  paragraph  width  when  reformatting  text/plain  parts  when
              $reflow_text  is  <u>set</u>.   When  the  value is 0, paragraphs will be wrapped at the terminal's right
              margin.  A positive value sets the paragraph width relative to the left margin.  A negative  value
              set the paragraph width relative to the right margin.

              Be  aware  that  the  reformatted  lines of a paragraph are still subject to $wrap.  This means if
              $reflow_wrap is 40 and $wrap is 30, then the paragraph gets reformatted to 40  characters  a  line
              (due  to  $reflow_wrap)  and  afterwards  each 40-character-line is split at 30 characters (due to
              $wrap), resulting in alternating line lengths of 30 and 10 characters.

              Also see $wrap.

       <b>reply_regex</b>
              Type: regular expression
              Default: "^((re|aw|sv)(\[[0-9]+\])*:[ \t]*)*"

              A regular expression used to recognize reply messages when threading  and  replying.  The  default
              value corresponds to the standard Latin "Re:" prefix.

              This  value  may have been localized by the translator for your locale, adding other prefixes that
              are common in the locale. You can add your own prefixes by appending inside "^(re)".  For example:
              "^(re|sv)" or "^(re|aw|sv)".

              The second parenthesized expression matches zero or more bracketed numbers following  the  prefix,
              such  as "Re[1]: ".  The initial "\\[" means a literal left-bracket character.  Note the backslash
              must be doubled when used inside a double quoted string in the neomuttrc.  "[0-9]+" means  one  or
              more  numbers.   "\\]"  means a literal right-bracket.  Finally the whole parenthesized expression
              has a "*" suffix, meaning it can occur zero or more times.

              The last part matches a colon followed by an optional space or tab.  Note "\t" is converted  to  a
              literal  tab  inside a double quoted string.  If you use a single quoted string, you would have to
              type an actual tab  character,  and  would  need  to  convert  the  double-backslashes  to  single
              backslashes.

              Note:  the  result  of  this  regex match against the subject is stored in the header cache.  Mutt
              isn't smart enough to invalidate a header cache entry based on changing $reply_regex,  so  if  you
              aren't  seeing correct values in the index, try temporarily turning off the header cache.  If that
              fixes the problem, then once the variable is set to your liking, remove your  stale  header  cache
              files and turn the header cache back on.

       <b>reply_self</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>unset</u> and you are replying to a message sent by you, NeoMutt will assume that you want to reply
              to the recipients of that message rather than to yourself.

              Also see the "alternates" command.

       <b>reply_to</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: ask-yes

              If <u>set</u>, when replying to a message, NeoMutt will use the address listed in the Reply-to: header as
              the  recipient of the reply.  If <u>unset</u>, it will use the address in the From: header field instead.
              This option is useful for reading a mailing list that sets the Reply-To: header field to the  list
              address and you want to send a private message to the author of a message.

       <b>reply_with_xorig</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This  variable provides a toggle. When active, the From: header will be extracted from the current
              mail's 'X-Original-To:' header. This setting does not have precedence over "reverse_real_name".

              Assuming 'fast_reply' is disabled, this option will prompt the user with a prefilled From: header.

       <b>resolve</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, the cursor in a list will be automatically advanced to  the  next  (possibly  undeleted)
              message/attachment/entry  whenever a command that modifies the current message/attachment/entry is
              executed.

              Examples of such commands are tagging a message, deleting an entry, or saving an attachment.

       <b>resume_draft_files</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u>, draft files (specified by -H on the command line) are processed similarly to when resuming
              a postponed message.  Recipients are not prompted for; send-hooks  are  not  evaluated;  no  alias
              expansion takes place; user-defined headers and signatures are not added to the message.

       <b>resume_edited_draft_files</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If   <u>set</u>,   draft   files   previously   edited  (via  -E  -H  on  the  command  line)  will  have
              $resume_draft_files automatically set when they are used as a draft file again.

              The first time a draft file is saved, NeoMutt will add a header, X-Mutt-Resume-Draft to the  saved
              file.   The  next  time  the  draft  file  is  read  in,  if  NeoMutt sees the header, it will set
              $resume_draft_files.

              This option is designed to prevent multiple signatures, user-defined headers, and other processing
              effects from being made multiple times to the draft file.

       <b>reverse_alias</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This variable controls whether or not NeoMutt will display the "personal" name from  your  aliases
              in  the  index  menu  if it finds an alias that matches the message's sender.  For example, if you
              have the following alias:

              alias juser <a href="mailto:abd30425@somewhere.net">abd30425@somewhere.net</a> (Joe User)

              and then you receive mail which contains the following header:

              From: <a href="mailto:abd30425@somewhere.net">abd30425@somewhere.net</a>

              It would be displayed in the index menu as "Joe User" instead of  "<a href="mailto:abd30425@somewhere.net">abd30425@somewhere.net</a>."   This
              is useful when the person's e-mail address is not human friendly.

       <b>reverse_name</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              It  may  sometimes arrive that you receive mail to a certain machine, move the messages to another
              machine, and reply to some the messages from there.  If this variable is <u>set</u>,  the  default  <u>From:</u>
              line  of  the  reply  messages  is built using the address where you received the messages you are
              replying to <b>if</b> that address matches your "alternates".  If the variable is <u>unset</u>, or  the  address
              that  would  be  used doesn't match your "alternates", the <u>From:</u> line will use your address on the
              current machine.

              Also see the "alternates" command and $reverse_real_name.

       <b>reverse_real_name</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This variable fine-tunes the behavior of the $reverse_name feature.

              When it is <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will remove the real name part of a matching address.  This  allows  the
              use of the email address without having to also use what the sender put in the real name field.

              When it is <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will use the matching address as-is.

              In either case, a missing real name will be filled in afterwards using the value of $real_name.

       <b>rfc2047_parameters</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  this  variable  is <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will decode RFC2047-encoded MIME parameters. You want to set
              this variable when NeoMutt suggests you to save attachments to files named like:

              =?iso-8859-1?Q?file=5F=E4=5F991116=2Ezip?=
              =?utf-8?Q?z=C4=99ta.png?=

              When this variable is <u>set</u> interactively, the change won't be active until you change folders.

              Note that  this  use  of  RFC2047's  encoding  is  explicitly  prohibited  by  the  standard,  but
              nevertheless encountered in the wild and produced by, e.g., Outlook.

              Also note that setting this parameter will <u>not</u> have the effect that NeoMutt <u>generates</u> this kind of
              encoding.  Instead, NeoMutt will unconditionally use the encoding specified in RFC2231.

       <b>save_address</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will take the sender's full address when choosing a default folder for saving a
              mail. If $save_name or $force_name is <u>set</u> too, the selection of the Fcc folder will be changed  as
              well.

       <b>save_empty</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  <u>unset</u>,  mailboxes which contain no saved messages will be removed when closed (the exception
              is $spool_file which is never removed).  If <u>set</u>, mailboxes are never removed.

              <b>Note:</b> This only applies to mbox  and  MMDF  folders,  NeoMutt  does  not  delete  MH  and  Maildir
              directories.

       <b>save_history</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              This variable controls the size of the history (per category) saved in the $history_file file.

              Setting this to a value greater than $history is possible.  However, there will never be more than
              $history entries to select from even if more are recorded in the history file.

       <b>save_name</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This  variable  controls  how copies of outgoing messages are saved.  When <u>set</u>, a check is made to
              see if a mailbox specified by the recipient address exists  (this  is  done  by  searching  for  a
              mailbox in the $folder directory with the <u>username</u> part of the recipient address).  If the mailbox
              exists,  the outgoing message will be saved to that mailbox, otherwise the message is saved to the
              $record mailbox.

              Also see the $force_name variable.

       <b>save_unsubscribed</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, info about unsubscribed newsgroups will be saved into "newsrc" file and into cache.

       <b>score</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When this variable is <u>unset</u>, scoring is turned off.  This can be  useful  to  selectively  disable
              scoring for certain folders when the $score_threshold_delete variable and related are used.

       <b>score_threshold_delete</b>
              Type: number
              Default: -1

              Messages  which  have  been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value of this variable are
              automatically marked for deletion by NeoMutt.  Since NeoMutt scores are  always  greater  than  or
              equal to zero, the default setting of this variable will never mark a message for deletion.

       <b>score_threshold_flag</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 9999

              Messages  which  have  been  assigned  a  score greater than or equal to this variable's value are
              automatically marked "flagged".

       <b>score_threshold_read</b>
              Type: number
              Default: -1

              Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value of  this  variable  are
              automatically marked as read by NeoMutt.  Since NeoMutt scores are always greater than or equal to
              zero, the default setting of this variable will never mark a message read.

       <b>search_context</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              For  the  pager,  this  variable  specifies  the  number  of lines shown before search results. By
              default, search results will be top-aligned.

       <b>send_charset</b>
              Type: string list
              Default: "us-ascii:iso-8859-1:utf-8"

              A colon-delimited list of character sets  for  outgoing  messages.  NeoMutt  will  use  the  first
              character  set into which the text can be converted exactly.  If your $charset is not "iso-8859-1"
              and recipients may not understand "UTF-8", it is advisable to include in the list  an  appropriate
              widely  used  standard  character  set  (such  as  "iso-8859-2", "koi8-r" or "iso-2022-jp") either
              instead of or after "iso-8859-1".

              In case the text can't be converted into  one  of  these  exactly,  NeoMutt  uses  $charset  as  a
              fallback.

       <b>sendmail</b>
              Type: command
              Default: "/usr/sbin/sendmail -oem -oi"

              Specifies  the  program  and arguments used to deliver mail sent by NeoMutt.  NeoMutt expects that
              the specified program interprets additional arguments as recipient addresses.  NeoMutt appends all
              recipients after adding a -- delimiter (if not already present).  Additional flags,  such  as  for
              $use_8bit_mime,   $use_envelope_from,  $dsn_notify,  or  $dsn_return  will  be  added  before  the
              delimiter.

              <b>Note:</b> This command is invoked differently from most other commands in NeoMutt.  It is tokenized by
              space, and invoked directly via <a href="../man3/execvp.3.html">execvp</a>(3) with an array of arguments - so  commands  or  arguments
              with spaces in them are not supported.  The shell is not used to run the command, so shell quoting
              is also not supported.

              <b>See</b> <b>also:</b> $write_bcc.

       <b>sendmail_wait</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              Specifies  the  number of seconds to wait for the $sendmail process to finish before giving up and
              putting delivery in the background.

              NeoMutt interprets the value of this variable as follows:
              &gt;0     number of seconds to wait for sendmail to finish before continuing
              0      wait forever for sendmail to finish
              &lt;0     always put sendmail in the background without waiting

              Note that if you specify a value other than 0, the output of the child process will be  put  in  a
              temporary file.  If there is some error, you will be informed as to where to find the output.

       <b>shell</b>
              Type: command
              Default: "<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>"

              Command  to  use  when  spawning  a  subshell.  If not specified, then the user's login shell from
              <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> is used.

       <b>show_multipart_alternative</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              When <u>set</u> to info, the multipart/alternative information is shown.  When <u>set</u> to inline, all of  the
              alternatives  are  displayed.   When  not  set,  the  default  behavior is to show only the chosen
              alternative.

       <b>show_new_news</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If <u>set</u>, news server will be asked for new newsgroups on entering the browser.  Otherwise, it  will
              be  done  only  once  for  a  news server.  Also controls whether or not number of new articles of
              subscribed newsgroups will be then checked.

       <b>show_only_unread</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u>, only subscribed newsgroups that contain unread articles will be displayed in browser.

       <b>sidebar_component_depth</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              By default the sidebar will show the mailbox's  path,  relative  to  the  $folder  variable.  This
              specifies  the number of parent directories to hide from display in the sidebar. For example: If a
              maildir   is   normally   displayed   in   the   sidebar   as   dir1/dir2/dir3/maildir,    setting
              sidebar_component_depth=2  will  display  it  as  dir3/maildir,  having  truncated  the  2 highest
              directories.

              <b>See</b> <b>also:</b> $sidebar_short_path

       <b>sidebar_delim_chars</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "<a href="file:/.">/.</a>"

              This contains the list of characters which you would  like  to  treat  as  folder  separators  for
              displaying paths in the sidebar.

              Local mail is often arranged in directories: 'dir1/dir2/mailbox'.

              set sidebar_delim_chars='/'

              IMAP mailboxes are often named: 'folder1.folder2.mailbox'.

              set sidebar_delim_chars='.'

              <b>See</b> <b>also:</b> $sidebar_short_path, $sidebar_folder_indent, $sidebar_indent_string.

       <b>sidebar_divider_char</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "|"

              The default is a Unicode vertical line.

              This specifies the characters to be drawn between the sidebar (when visible) and the other NeoMutt
              panels. ASCII and Unicode line-drawing characters are supported.

              The  divider  char  can  be  set  to  an empty string for some extra space.  If empty, setting the
              sidebar_background color may help distinguish the sidebar from other panels.

       <b>sidebar_folder_indent</b>
              Type: boolean

       <b>sidebar_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "%D%*  %n"

              This  variable  allows  you  to  customize  the  sidebar  display.  This  string  is  similar   to
              $index_format, but has its own set of <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like sequences:
              %a

                     "!"  : one flagged message; "!!" : two flagged messages; "n!" : n flagged messages (for n &gt;
                     2).  Otherwise prints nothing.
              %&gt;X

                     Right justify the rest of the string and pad with "X"
              %|X

              * = Can be optionally printed if nonzero

              @ = Only applicable to the current folder

              In order to use %S, %N, %F, and %!, $mail_check_stats must be <u>set</u>.  When  thus  set,  a  suggested
              value for this option is "%B%&lt;F? [%F]&gt;%* %&lt;N?%N/&gt;%S".

       <b>sidebar_indent_string</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "  "

              This  specifies  the  string  that is used to indent mailboxes in the sidebar.  It defaults to two
              spaces.

              <b>See</b> <b>also:</b> $sidebar_short_path, $sidebar_folder_indent, $sidebar_delim_chars.

       <b>sidebar_new_mail_only</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, the sidebar will only display mailboxes containing new, or flagged, mail.

              <b>See</b> <b>also:</b> sidebar_pin, $sidebar_non_empty_mailbox_only.

       <b>sidebar_next_new_wrap</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, the &lt;sidebar-next-new&gt; command will not stop at the end of the list  of  mailboxes,  but
              wrap  around  to  the  beginning.  The  &lt;sidebar-prev-new&gt; command is similarly affected, wrapping
              around to the end of the list.

       <b>sidebar_non_empty_mailbox_only</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, the sidebar will only display mailboxes that contain one or more mails.

              <b>See</b> <b>also:</b> $sidebar_new_mail_only, sidebar_pin.

       <b>sidebar_on_right</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When set, the sidebar will appear on the right-hand side of the screen.

       <b>sidebar_short_path</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              By default the sidebar will show the mailbox's path, relative to  the  $folder  variable.  Setting
              sidebar_shortpath=yes will shorten the names relative to the previous name. Here's an example:
              <b>shortpath=no</b>
                     <b>shortpath=yes</b> <b>shortpath=yes,</b> <b>folderindent=yes,</b> <b>indentstr=".."</b>

       <b>sidebar_sort</b>
              Type: sort order
              Default: unsorted

              Specifies how to sort mailbox entries in the sidebar.   By  default,  the  entries  are  <b>unsorted</b>.
              Valid values:
              ‐ <b>count</b> (all message count)
              ‐ <b>desc</b> (mailbox description)
              ‐ <b>flagged</b> (flagged message count)
              ‐ <b>path</b> (alphabetically)
              ‐ <b>unread</b> (unread message count)
              ‐ <b>unsorted</b>

              You  may  optionally  use  the  "reverse-"  prefix to specify reverse sorting order (example: "set
              sidebar_sort=reverse-path").

              The <b>alpha</b> and <b>name</b> values are synonyms for <b>path</b>. The <b>new</b> value is a synonym for <b>unread</b>.

       <b>sidebar_visible</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This specifies whether or not to show sidebar. The sidebar shows a list of all your mailboxes.

              <b>See</b> <b>also:</b> $sidebar_format, $sidebar_width

       <b>sidebar_width</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 30

              This controls the width of  the  sidebar.   It  is  measured  in  screen  columns.   For  example:
              sidebar_width=20 could display 20 ASCII characters, or 10 Chinese characters.

       <b>sig_dashes</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If <u>set</u>, a line containing "-- " (note the trailing space) will be inserted before your $signature.
              It  is  <b>strongly</b>  recommended that you not <u>unset</u> this variable unless your signature contains just
              your name.  The reason for this is because many software packages  use  "--  \n"  to  detect  your
              signature.   For  example, NeoMutt has the ability to highlight the signature in a different color
              in the built-in pager.

       <b>sig_on_top</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u>, the signature will be included before any  quoted  or  forwarded  text.   It  is  <b>strongly</b>
              recommended  that  you do not set this variable unless you really know what you are doing, and are
              prepared to take some heat from netiquette guardians.

       <b>signature</b>
              Type: path
              Default: "<a href="file:~/.signature">~/.signature</a>"

              Specifies the filename of your signature, which is appended to all  outgoing  messages.    If  the
              filename  ends  with a pipe ("|"), it is assumed that filename is a shell command and input should
              be read from its standard output.

       <b>simple_search</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "~f %s | ~s %s"

              Specifies how NeoMutt should expand a simple search into a real search pattern.  A  simple  search
              is  one  that  does  not  contain  any  of  the  "~"  pattern  operators.  See "patterns" for more
              information on search patterns.

              simple_search applies to several functions,  e.g.  &lt;delete-pattern&gt;,  &lt;limit&gt;,  searching  in  the
              index, and all of the index colors.

              For  example,  if  you  simply  type "joe" at a search or limit prompt, NeoMutt will automatically
              expand it to the value specified by this variable by replacing "%s" with the supplied string.  For
              the default value, "joe" would be expanded to: "~f joe | ~s joe".

       <b>size_show_bytes</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u>, message sizes will display bytes for values less than 1 kilobyte.  See formatstrings-size.

       <b>size_show_fractions</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If <u>set</u>, message sizes will be displayed with a single  decimal  value  for  sizes  from  0  to  10
              kilobytes and 1 to 10 megabytes.  See formatstrings-size.

       <b>size_show_mb</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If  <u>set</u>, message sizes will display megabytes for values greater than or equal to 1 megabyte.  See
              formatstrings-size.

       <b>size_units_on_left</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u>, message sizes units will be displayed to the left of the number.  See formatstrings-size.

       <b>sleep_time</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 1

              Specifies time, in seconds, to pause while displaying certain informational messages, while moving
              from folder to folder and after expunging messages from the current folder.   The  default  is  to
              pause one second, so a value of zero for this option suppresses the pause.

       <b>smart_wrap</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls  the  display  of  lines longer than the screen width in the internal pager. If <u>set</u>, long
              lines are wrapped at a word boundary.  If <u>unset</u>, lines are simply wrapped at the screen edge. Also
              see the $markers variable.

       <b>smileys</b>
              Type: regular expression
              Default: "(&gt;From )|(:[-^]?[][)(&gt;&lt;}{|/DP])"

              The <u>pager</u> uses this variable to catch some common false positives of  $quote_regex,  most  notably
              smileys  and  not  consider a line quoted text if it also matches $smileys. This mostly happens at
              the beginning of a line.

       <b>smime_ask_cert_label</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This flag controls whether you want to be asked to enter a label for a  certificate  about  to  be
              added to the database or not. It is <u>set</u> by default.  (S/MIME only)

       <b>smime_ca_location</b>
              Type: path
              Default: ""

              This  variable  contains  the  name  of  either  a  directory,  or  a  file which contains trusted
              certificates for use with OpenSSL.  (S/MIME only)

       <b>smime_certificates</b>
              Type: path
              Default: ""

              Since for S/MIME there is no pubring/secring as with  PGP,  NeoMutt  has  to  handle  storage  and
              retrieval of keys by itself. This is very basic right now, and keys and certificates are stored in
              two  different directories, both named as the hash-value retrieved from OpenSSL. There is an index
              file which contains mailbox-address keyid pairs, and which can be  manually  edited.  This  option
              points to the location of the certificates.  (S/MIME only)

       <b>smime_decrypt_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This   format  string  specifies  a  command  which  is  used  to  decrypt  application/pkcs7-mime
              attachments.

              The OpenSSL command formats have their own set of <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like sequences similar to PGP's:
              %a     The algorithm used for encryption.
              %c     One or more certificate IDs.
              %C     CA location:  Depending on whether $smime_ca_location points to a directory or  file,  this
                     expands to "-CApath $smime_ca_location" or "-CAfile $smime_ca_location".
              %d     The message digest algorithm specified with $smime_sign_digest_alg.
              %f     Expands to the name of a file containing a message.
              %i     Intermediate certificates
              %k     The key-pair specified with $smime_default_key
              %s     Expands  to  the  name  of  a  file  containing  the  signature  part of a multipart/signed
                     attachment when verifying it.

              For examples on how to configure these formats, see the  smime.rc  in  the  samples/  subdirectory
              which has been installed on your system alongside the documentation.  (S/MIME only)

       <b>smime_decrypt_use_default_key</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If  <u>set</u> (default) this tells NeoMutt to use the default key for decryption. Otherwise, if managing
              multiple certificate-key-pairs, NeoMutt will try to use the mailbox-address to determine  the  key
              to use. It will ask you to supply a key, if it can't find one.  (S/MIME only)

       <b>smime_default_key</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              This  is  the  default  key-pair  to  use for S/MIME operations, and must be set to the keyid (the
              hash-value that OpenSSL generates) to work properly.

              It will be used for encryption  (see  $postpone_encrypt  and  $smime_self_encrypt).  If  GPGME  is
              enabled, this is the key id displayed by gpgsm.

              It will be used for decryption unless $smime_decrypt_use_default_key is <u>unset</u>.

              It will also be used for signing unless $smime_sign_as is set.

              The  (now deprecated) <u>smime_self_encrypt_as</u> is an alias for this variable, and should no longer be
              used.  (S/MIME only)

       <b>smime_encrypt_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This command is used to create encrypted S/MIME messages.

              This is a format string,  see  the  $smime_decrypt_command  command  for  possible  <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like
              sequences.  (S/MIME only)

              Encrypt the message to $smime_default_key too.  (S/MIME only)

              <b>Note:</b>  On  Debian  systems,  this  defaults  to  the  first  existing  file in the following list:

       <b>smime_encrypt_with</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "aes256"

              This sets the algorithm that should be used for encryption.  Valid choices are "aes128", "aes192",
              "aes256", "des", "des3", "rc2-40", "rc2-64", "rc2-128".  (S/MIME only)

       <b>smime_get_cert_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This command is used to extract X509 certificates from a PKCS7 structure.

              This is a format string,  see  the  $smime_decrypt_command  command  for  possible  <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like

       <b>smime_get_cert_email_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This  command  is used to extract the mail address(es) used for storing X509 certificates, and for
              verification purposes (to check whether the certificate was issued for the sender's mailbox).

              This is a format string,  see  the  $smime_decrypt_command  command  for  possible  <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like

       <b>smime_get_signer_cert_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This command is used to extract only the signers X509 certificate from a S/MIME signature, so that
              the certificate's owner may get compared to the email's "From:" field.

              This  is  a  format  string,  see  the  $smime_decrypt_command command for possible <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like
              sequences.  (S/MIME only)

       <b>smime_import_cert_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This command is used to import a certificate via smime_keys.

              This is a format string,  see  the  $smime_decrypt_command  command  for  possible  <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like
              sequences.   NOTE:  %c and %k will default to $smime_sign_as if set, otherwise $smime_default_key.

       <b>smime_is_default</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              The default behavior of NeoMutt is to use PGP on all auto-sign/encryption operations. To  override
              and  to  use  OpenSSL instead this must be <u>set</u>.  However, this has no effect while replying, since
              NeoMutt will automatically select the same application that was used to sign/encrypt the  original
              message.   (Note  that  this  variable can be overridden by unsetting $crypt_auto_smime.)  (S/MIME
              only)

       <b>smime_keys</b>
              Type: path
              Default: ""

              Since for S/MIME there is no pubring/secring as with  PGP,  NeoMutt  has  to  handle  storage  and
              retrieval  of keys/certs by itself. This is very basic right now, and stores keys and certificates
              in two different directories, both named as the hash-value retrieved from  OpenSSL.  There  is  an
              index  file  which  contains  mailbox-address  keyid  pair, and which can be manually edited. This
              option points to the location of the private keys.  (S/MIME only)

       <b>smime_pk7out_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This command is used to extract PKCS7 structures of S/MIME signatures, in  order  to  extract  the
              public X509 certificate(s).

              This  is  a  format  string,  see  the  $smime_decrypt_command command for possible <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like

       <b>smime_self_encrypt</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  <u>set</u>,  S/MIME  encrypted  messages  will  also  be  encrypted  using   the   certificate   in
              $smime_default_key.  (S/MIME only)

       <b>smime_sign_as</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              If you have a separate key to use for signing, you should set this to the signing key. Most people
              will only need to set $smime_default_key.  (S/MIME only)

       <b>smime_sign_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This  command  is used to created S/MIME signatures of type multipart/signed, which can be read by
              all mail clients.

              This is a format string,  see  the  $smime_decrypt_command  command  for  possible  <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like
              sequences.  (S/MIME only)

       <b>smime_sign_digest_alg</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "sha256"

              This  sets  the algorithm that should be used for the signature message digest.  Valid choices are
              "md5", "sha1", "sha224", "sha256", "sha384", "sha512".  (S/MIME only)

       <b>smime_timeout</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 300

              The number of seconds after which a cached passphrase will expire if not used.  (S/MIME only)

       <b>smime_verify_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This command is used to verify S/MIME signatures of type multipart/signed.

              This is a format string,  see  the  $smime_decrypt_command  command  for  possible  <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like

       <b>smime_verify_opaque_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              This command is used to verify S/MIME signatures of type application/pkcs7-mime.

              This  is  a  format  string,  see  the  $smime_decrypt_command command for possible <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like

       <b>smtp_authenticators</b>
              Type: string list
              Default: ""

              This is a colon-separated list of authentication methods NeoMutt may attempt to use to log  in  to
              an  SMTP  server,  in  the  order  NeoMutt  should  try them.  Authentication methods are any SASL
              mechanism, e.g. "plain", "digest-md5", "gssapi" or "cram-md5".  This option  is  case-insensitive.
              If  it  is "unset" (the default) NeoMutt will try all available methods, in order from most-secure
              to least-secure. Support for the "plain" mechanism is bundled; other mechanisms are provided by an
              external SASL library (look for '+sasl' in the output of neomutt -v).

              Example:

              set smtp_authenticators="digest-md5:cram-md5"

       <b>smtp_oauth_refresh_command</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              The command to run to generate an OAUTH refresh token for authorizing your connection to your SMTP
              server.  This command will be run on every connection attempt that uses the OAUTHBEARER or XOAUTH2
              authentication mechanisms.  See "oauth" for details.

       <b>smtp_pass</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              Specifies the password for your SMTP account.  If <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will prompt you for your password
              when you first send mail via SMTP.  See $smtp_url to configure NeoMutt to send mail via SMTP.

              <b>Warning</b>: you should only use this option when you are on a  fairly  secure  machine,  because  the
              superuser can read your neomuttrc even if you are the only one who can read the file.

       <b>smtp_url</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              Defines  the  SMTP smarthost where sent messages should relayed for delivery. This should take the
              form of an SMTP URL, e.g.:

              smtp[s]://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]

              where "[...]" denotes an optional  part.   Setting  this  variable  overrides  the  value  of  the
              $sendmail variable.

              Also see $write_bcc.

       <b>smtp_user</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              The username for the SMTP server.

              This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.

       <b>socket_timeout</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 30

              Causes  NeoMutt  to  timeout any socket connect/read/write operation (for IMAP, POP or SMTP) after
              this many seconds.  A negative value causes NeoMutt to wait indefinitely.

       <b>sort</b>
              Type: sort order
              Default: date

              Specifies how to sort messages in the "index" menu.  Valid values are:
              ‐ date
              ‐ date-received
              ‐ from
              ‐ label
              ‐ score
              ‐ size
              ‐ spam
              ‐ subject
              ‐ threads
              ‐ to
              ‐ unsorted

              You may optionally use the "reverse-" prefix to specify reverse  sorting  order,  or  the  "last-"
              prefix to sort threads based on the corresponding attribute of the last descendant rather than the
              thread  root.   If  both  prefixes  are  in use, "reverse-" must come before "last-".  The "last-"
              prefix has no effect on a flat view.

              Any ties in the primary  sort  are  broken  by  $sort_aux.   When  $use_threads  is  "threads"  or
              "reverse", $sort controls the sorting between threads, and $sort_aux controls the sorting within a
              thread.

              The  "date-sent"  value  is  a  synonym  for  "date".  The  "mailbox-order" value is a synonym for
              "unsorted".

              The values of "threads" and "reverse-threads"  are  legacy  options,  which  cause  the  value  of
              $sort_aux  to  also  control  sorting  between  threads, and they may not be used with the "last-"
              prefix.  The preferred way to enable a threaded view is via $use_threads.  This variable can  also
              be set via the &lt;sort-mailbox&gt; and &lt;sort-reverse&gt; functions.

              Note:  When $use_threads is "threads", the last thread sorts to the bottom; when it is "reversed",
              the last thread sorts to the top.  The use of "reverse-" in $sort swaps which end the last  thread
              will sort to.

              See    the    "Use    Threads   Feature"   section   for   further   explanation   and   examples,
              https://neomutt.org/feature/use-threads

       <b>sort_aux</b>
              Type: sort order
              Default: date

              This provides a secondary sort for messages in the "index" menu, used  when  the  $sort  value  is
              equal for two messages.

              When  sorting  by threads, this variable controls how subthreads are sorted within a single thread
              (for the order between threads, see $sort).  This  can  be  set  to  any  value  that  $sort  can,
              including  with  the use of "reverse-" and "last-" prefixes, except for variations using "threads"
              (in that case, NeoMutt will just use "date").  For instance,

              set sort_aux=last-date-received

              would mean that if a new message is received in a thread, that  subthread  becomes  the  last  one
              displayed  (or  the first, if you have "set use_threads=reverse".)  When using $use_threads, it is
              more common to use "last-" with $sort and not with $sort_aux.

              See   the   "Use   Threads   Feature"   section   for   further    explanation    and    examples,
              https://neomutt.org/feature/use-threads

       <b>sort_re</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              This variable is only useful when sorting by threads with $strict_threads <u>unset</u>.  In that case, it
              changes the heuristic neomutt uses to thread messages by subject.  With $sort_re <u>set</u>, neomutt will
              only  attach  a  message  as  the  child of another message by subject if the subject of the child
              message starts with a substring matching  the  setting  of  $reply_regex.   With  $sort_re  <u>unset</u>,
              neomutt  will  attach the message whether or not this is the case, as long as the non-$reply_regex
              parts of both messages are identical.

       <b>spam_separator</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ","

              This variable controls what happens when  multiple  spam  headers  are  matched:  if  <u>unset</u>,  each
              successive  header  will  overwrite  any  previous  matches value for the spam label. If <u>set</u>, each
              successive match will append to the previous, using this variable's value as a separator.

       <b>spool_file</b>
              Type: mailbox
              Default: ""

              If your spool mailbox is in a non-default place where NeoMutt can't find it, you can  specify  its
              location  with this variable. The description from "named-mailboxes" or "virtual-mailboxes" may be
              used for the spool_file.

              If not specified, then the environment variables $MAIL and $MAILDIR will be checked.

       <b>ssl_ca_certificates_file</b>
              Type: path
              Default: ""

              This variable specifies a file containing trusted CA certificates.  Any server certificate that is
              signed with one of these CA certificates is also automatically accepted. (GnuTLS only)

              Example:

              set ssl_ca_certificates_file=<a href="file:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt">/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt</a>

       <b>ssl_ciphers</b>
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              Contains a colon-separated list of ciphers to use when using SSL.  For OpenSSL, see <a href="../man1/ciphers.1.html">ciphers</a>(1) for
              the syntax of the string.

              For GnuTLS, this option will be used in place of "NORMAL" at the start  of  the  priority  string.
              See <a href="../man3/gnutls_priority_init.3.html">gnutls_priority_init</a>(3) for the syntax and more details. (Note: GnuTLS version 2.1.7 or higher
              is required.)

       <b>ssl_client_cert</b>
              Type: path
              Default: ""

              The file containing a client certificate and its associated private key.

       <b>ssl_force_tls</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If this variable is <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will require that all connections to remote servers be encrypted.
              Furthermore it will attempt to negotiate TLS even if the server does not advertise the capability,
              since   it   would  otherwise  have  to  abort  the  connection  anyway.  This  option  supersedes
              $ssl_starttls.

       <b>ssl_min_dh_prime_bits</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              This variable specifies the minimum acceptable prime size (in bits) for use in any  Diffie-Hellman
              key exchange. A value of 0 will use the default from the GNUTLS library. (GnuTLS only)

       <b>ssl_starttls</b>
              Type: quadoption
              Default: yes

              If  <u>set</u> (the default), NeoMutt will attempt to use STARTTLS on servers advertising the capability.
              When <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will not attempt to use STARTTLS regardless of the server's capabilities.

              <b>Note</b>  that  STARTTLS  is  subject  to  many  kinds  of  attacks,  including  the  ability   of   a
              machine-in-the-middle   to  suppress  the  advertising  of  support.   Setting  $ssl_force_tls  is
              recommended if you rely on STARTTLS.

       <b>ssl_use_sslv2</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u> , NeoMutt will use SSLv2 when communicating with servers that request it. <b>N.B.</b> <b>As</b> <b>of</b>  <b>2011,</b>
              <b>SSLv2</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>considered</b>  <b>insecure,</b> <b>and</b> <b>using</b> <b>is</b> <b>inadvisable</b>. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6176
              (OpenSSL only)

       <b>ssl_use_sslv3</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u> , NeoMutt will use SSLv3 when communicating with servers that request it. <b>N.B.</b> <b>As</b> <b>of</b>  <b>2015,</b>
              <b>SSLv3</b> <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> <b>insecure,</b> <b>and</b> <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inadvisable</b>. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7525

       <b>ssl_use_system_certs</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If set to <u>yes</u>, NeoMutt will use CA certificates in the system-wide certificate store when checking
              if a server certificate is signed by a trusted CA. (OpenSSL only)

       <b>ssl_use_tlsv1</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If  <u>set</u>  ,  NeoMutt  will  use TLSv1.0 when communicating with servers that request it. <b>N.B.</b> <b>As</b> <b>of</b>
              <b>2015,</b>   <b>TLSv1.0</b>   <b>is</b>    <b>considered</b>    <b>insecure,</b>    <b>and</b>    <b>using</b>    <b>it</b>    <b>is</b>    <b>inadvisable</b>.    See

       <b>ssl_use_tlsv1_1</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If  <u>set</u>  ,  NeoMutt  will  use TLSv1.1 when communicating with servers that request it. <b>N.B.</b> <b>As</b> <b>of</b>
              <b>2015,</b>   <b>TLSv1.1</b>   <b>is</b>    <b>considered</b>    <b>insecure,</b>    <b>and</b>    <b>using</b>    <b>it</b>    <b>is</b>    <b>inadvisable</b>.    See

       <b>ssl_use_tlsv1_2</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If <u>set</u> , NeoMutt will use TLSv1.2 when communicating with servers that request it.

       <b>ssl_use_tlsv1_3</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If <u>set</u> , NeoMutt will use TLSv1.3 when communicating with servers that request it.

       <b>ssl_verify_dates</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If  <u>set</u>  (the  default), NeoMutt will not automatically accept a server certificate that is either
              not yet valid or already expired. You should only unset this for particular known hosts, using the
              &lt;account-hook&gt; function.

       <b>ssl_verify_host</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              If <u>set</u> (the default), NeoMutt will not automatically accept a server certificate whose  host  name
              does  not  match the host used in your folder URL. You should only unset this for particular known
              hosts, using the &lt;account-hook&gt; function.

       <b>ssl_verify_partial_chains</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This option should not be changed from the default unless you understand what you are doing.

              Setting this variable to  <u>yes</u>  will  permit  verifying  partial  certification  chains,  i.  e.  a
              certificate chain where not the root, but an intermediate certificate CA, or the host certificate,
              are marked trusted (in $certificate_file), without marking the root signing CA as trusted.

              (OpenSSL 1.0.2b and newer only).

       <b>status_chars</b>
              Type: character string
              Default: "-*%A"

              Controls the characters used by the "%r" indicator in $status_format.
              <b>Character</b>
                     <b>Default</b> <b>Description</b>
              1      - Mailbox is unchanged
              2      * Mailbox has been changed and needs to be resynchronized
              3      %  Mailbox  is  read-only, or will not be written when exiting.  (You can toggle whether to
                     write changes to a mailbox with the &lt;toggle-write&gt; operation, bound by default to "%")
              4      A Folder opened in attach-message mode.  (Certain operations like  composing  a  new  mail,
                     replying, forwarding, etc. are not permitted in this mode)

       <b>status_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "-%r-NeoMutt: %D [Msgs:%&lt;M?%M/&gt;%m%&lt;n? New:%n&gt;%&lt;o? Old:%o&gt;%&lt;d? Del:%d&gt;%&lt;F? Flag:%F&gt;%&lt;t? Tag:%t&gt;%&lt;p? Post:%p&gt;%&lt;b? Inc:%b&gt;%&lt;l? %l&gt;]---(%&lt;T?%T/&gt;%s/%S)-%&gt;-(%P)---"

              Controls  the  format of the status line displayed in the "index" menu.  This string is similar to
              $index_format, but has its own set of <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like sequences:
              %b     * Number of mailboxes with new mail
              %d     * Number of deleted messages
              %D

                     Description of the mailbox

              %*X

                     Soft-fill with character "X" as pad

              For an explanation of "soft-fill", see the $index_format documentation.

              * = can be optionally printed if nonzero

              Some  of  the  above sequences can be used to optionally print a string if their value is nonzero.
              For example, you may only want to see the number of flagged messages if such messages exist, since
              zero is not particularly meaningful.  To optionally print a string based upon  one  of  the  above
              sequences, the following construct is used:

              %&lt;sequence_char?optional_string&gt;

              where  <u>sequence_char</u>  is  a  character from the table above, and <u>optional_string</u> is the string you
              would like printed if <u>sequence_char</u> is nonzero.  <u>optional_string</u> <b>may</b> contain  other  sequences  as
              well as normal text.

              Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number of new messages in a mailbox:

              %&lt;n?%n new messages&gt;

              You can also switch between two strings using the following construct:

              %&lt;sequence_char?if_string&amp;else_string&gt;

              If  the value of <u>sequence_char</u> is non-zero, <u>if_string</u> will be expanded, otherwise <u>else_string</u> will
              be expanded.

              As another example, here is how to show either $sort and  $sort_aux  or  $use_threads  and  $sort,
              based on whether threads are enabled with $use_threads:

              %&lt;T?%s/%S&amp;%T/%s&gt;

              You  can force the result of any <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like sequence to be lowercase by prefixing the sequence
              character with an underscore ("_") sign.  For example, if you want to display the  local  hostname
              in lowercase, you would use: "%_h".

              If  you  prefix the sequence character with a colon (":") character, NeoMutt will replace any dots
              in the expansion by underscores. This might be helpful with IMAP folders that don't like  dots  in
              folder names.

       <b>status_on_top</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Setting  this  variable  causes  the  "status bar" to be displayed on the first line of the screen
              rather than near the bottom. If $help is <u>set</u> too, it'll be placed at the bottom.

       <b>strict_threads</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u>, threading will only make use of the "In-Reply-To" and "References:" fields when you  $sort
              by  message  threads.   By default, messages with the same subject are grouped together in "pseudo
              threads.". This may not always be desirable, such as in a personal mailbox where  you  might  have
              several  unrelated  messages with the subjects like "hi" which will get grouped together. See also
              $sort_re for a less drastic way of controlling this behavior.

       <b>suspend</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt won't stop when the user presses the terminal's <u>susp</u> key, usually  "^Z".  This
              is useful if you run NeoMutt inside an xterm using a command like "xterm -e neomutt".

              On  startup  NeoMutt  tries  to detect if it is the process session leader.  If so, the default of
              suspend is "no" otherwise "yes".  This default covers the above mentioned use case  of  "xterm  -e
              neomutt".

       <b>text_flowed</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will  generate  "format=flowed"  bodies  with  a content type of "text/plain;
              format=flowed".  This format is easier to handle for some mailing  software,  and  generally  just
              looks  like ordinary text.  To actually make use of this format's features, you'll need support in
              your editor.

              The option only controls newly composed messages.  Postponed messages, resent messages, and  draft
              messages (via -H on the command line) will use the content-type of the source message.

              Note that $indent_string is ignored when this option is <u>set</u>.

       <b>thorough_search</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Affects the ~b, ~B, and ~h search operations described in section "patterns".  If <u>set</u>, the headers
              and  body/attachments  of messages to be searched are decoded before searching. If <u>unset</u>, messages
              are searched as they appear in the folder.

              Users searching attachments or for non-ASCII characters should <u>set</u>  this  value  because  decoding
              also includes MIME parsing/decoding and possible character set conversions. Otherwise NeoMutt will
              attempt  to  match  against the raw message received (for example quoted-printable encoded or with
              encoded headers) which may lead to incorrect search results.

       <b>thread_received</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If $strict_threads is <u>unset</u>, then messages may also be grouped by subject.   Unlike  threading  by
              "In-Reply-To:"  and  "References:"  header,  grouping  by  subject  does  not imply a parent-child
              relation between two messages.

              To determine the ancestry between messages grouped by subject, Neomutt uses their date: only newer
              messages can be descendants of older ones.

              When $thread_received is <u>set</u>, NeoMutt uses the date  received  rather  than  the  date  sent  when
              comparing messages for the date.

              See also $strict_threads, and $sort_re.

       <b>tilde</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, the internal-pager will pad blank lines to the bottom of the screen with a tilde ("~").

       <b>time_inc</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              Along  with  $read_inc,  $write_inc, and $net_inc, this variable controls the frequency with which
              progress updates are displayed. It suppresses updates less than $time_inc milliseconds apart. This
              can improve throughput on systems with slow terminals, or when running NeoMutt on a remote system.

              Also see the "tuning" section of the manual for performance considerations.

       <b>timeout</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 600

              When NeoMutt is waiting for user input either idling in menus or in an interactive prompt, NeoMutt
              would block until input  is  present.  Depending  on  the  context,  this  would  prevent  certain
              operations from working, like checking for new mail or keeping an IMAP connection alive.

              This  variable  controls  how  many  seconds NeoMutt will at most wait until it aborts waiting for
              input, performs these operations and continues to wait for input.

              A value of zero or less will cause NeoMutt to never time out.

       <b>tmp_dir</b>
              Type: path
              Default: "<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>"

              This variable allows you to specify where NeoMutt  will  place  its  temporary  files  needed  for
              displaying and composing messages.

              If  this variable is not set, the environment variable $TMPDIR is used.  Failing that, then "<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>"
              is used.

       <b>to_chars</b>
              Type: character string
              Default: " +TCFLR"

              Controls the character used to indicate mail addressed to you.
              <b>Character</b>
                     <b>Default</b> <b>Description</b>
              1      &lt;space&gt; The mail is <u>not</u> addressed to your address.
              2      + You are the only recipient of the message.
              3      T Your address appears in the "To:" header field, but you are not the only recipient of the
                     message.
              4      C Your address is specified in the "Cc:" header field, but you are not the only recipient.
              5      F Indicates the mail that was sent by <u>you</u>.
              6      L Indicates the mail was sent to a mailing-list you subscribe to.
              7      R Your address appears in the "Reply-To:" header field but none of the above applies.

       <b>toggle_quoted_show_levels</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              Quoted text may be filtered out using the &lt;toggle-quoted&gt; command.  If set  to  a  number  greater
              than 0, then the &lt;toggle-quoted&gt; command will only filter out quote levels above this number.

       <b>trash</b>
              Type: mailbox
              Default: ""

              If  set,  this variable specifies the path of the trash folder where the mails marked for deletion
              will be moved, instead of being irremediably purged.

              NOTE: When you delete a message in the trash folder, it is really deleted, so that you have a  way
              to clean the trash.

       <b>ts_enabled</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Controls  whether  NeoMutt  tries  to  set  the terminal status line and icon name.  Most terminal
              emulators emulate the status line in the window title.

       <b>ts_icon_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "M%&lt;n?AIL&amp;ail&gt;"

              Controls the format of the icon title, as long as "$ts_enabled" is set.  This string is  identical
              in formatting to the one used by "$status_format".

       <b>ts_status_format</b>
              Type: string
              Default: "NeoMutt with %&lt;m?%m messages&amp;no messages&gt;%&lt;n? [%n NEW]&gt;"

              Controls the format of the terminal status line (or window title), provided that "$ts_enabled" has
              been set. This string is identical in formatting to the one used by "$status_format".

       <b>tunnel</b>
              Type: command
              Default: ""

              Setting  this variable will cause NeoMutt to open a pipe to a command instead of a raw socket. You
              may be able to use this to set up preauthenticated  connections  to  your  IMAP/POP3/SMTP  server.
              Example:

              set tunnel="ssh -q mailhost.net /usr/local/libexec/imapd"

              Note:  For this example to work you must be able to log in to the remote machine without having to
              enter a password.

              When set, NeoMutt uses the tunnel for all remote connections.  Please see  "account-hook"  in  the
              manual for how to use different tunnel commands per connection.

       <b>tunnel_is_secure</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will  assume the $tunnel connection does not need STARTTLS to be enabled.  It
              will also allow IMAP PREAUTH server responses inside a tunnel to proceed.  This is appropriate  if
              $tunnel uses ssh or directly invokes the server locally.

              When  <u>unset</u>,  NeoMutt  will  negotiate  STARTTLS  according  to the ssl_starttls and ssl_force_tls
              variables.  If ssl_force_tls is set, NeoMutt will abort connecting if an IMAP server responds with
              PREAUTH.  This setting is appropriate if $tunnel does not provide security and could  be  tampered
              with by attackers.

       <b>uncollapse_jump</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will  jump  to  the  next  unread message, if any, when the current thread is
              <u>un</u>collapsed.

       <b>uncollapse_new</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will automatically  uncollapse  any  collapsed  thread  that  receives  a  newly
              delivered message.  When <u>unset</u>, collapsed threads will remain collapsed. The presence of the newly
              delivered message will still affect index sorting, though.

       <b>use_8bit_mime</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              <b>Warning:</b>  do  not  set this variable unless you are using a version of sendmail which supports the
              -B8BITMIME flag (such as sendmail 8.8.x) or you may not be able to send mail.

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will invoke $sendmail with the -B8BITMIME flag when sending  8-bit  messages  to
              enable ESMTP negotiation.

       <b>use_domain</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When  <u>set</u>,  NeoMutt  will  qualify all local addresses (ones without the "@host" portion) with the
              value of $hostname.  If <u>unset</u>, no addresses will be qualified.

       <b>use_envelope_from</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will set the <u>envelope</u> sender of the message.  If $envelope_from_address is  <u>set</u>,
              it  will  be  used as the sender address. If <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will attempt to derive the sender from
              the "From:" header.

              Note that this information is passed to  sendmail  command  using  the  -f  command  line  switch.
              Therefore  setting  this  option is not useful if the $sendmail variable already contains -f or if
              the executable pointed to by $sendmail doesn't support the -f switch.

       <b>use_from</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will generate the "From:" header field when  sending  messages.   If  <u>unset</u>,  no
              "From:"  header  field  will  be  generated unless the user explicitly sets one using the "my_hdr"
              command.

       <b>use_ipv6</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will look for IPv6 addresses of hosts it tries to contact.  If  this  option  is
              <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will restrict itself to IPv4 addresses.  Normally, the default should work.

       <b>use_threads</b>
              Type: enumeration
              Default: unset

              The  style  of  threading  used  in  the  index.  May  be  one of "flat" (no threading), "threads"
              (threaded, with subthreads below root message) or "reverse" (threaded, with subthreads above  root
              message).  For  convenience, the value "yes" is a synonym for "threads", and "no" is a synonym for
              "flat".

              If this variable is never set, then $sort controls whether threading is used,  $sort_aux  controls
              both  the  sorting  of  threads and subthreads, and using &lt;sort-mailbox&gt; to select threads affects
              only $sort.  Once this variable is set, attempting to set $sort to a value  using  "threads"  will
              warn,  the  value  of  $sort controls the sorting between threads while $sort_aux controls sorting
              within a thread, and &lt;sort-mailbox&gt; toggles $use_threads.

              Example:

              set use_threads=yes

              See the "Use Threads Feature" section for further explanation and examples.

              <b>Note:</b> On Debian systems, this option is set by default to “threads” in /etc/neomuttrc.

       <b>user_agent</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will add a "User-Agent:" header to outgoing messages, indicating  which  version
              of NeoMutt was used for composing them.

       <b>virtual_spool_file</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              This  command is now unnecessary. $spool_file has been extended to support mailbox descriptions as
              a value.

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will use the first defined virtual mailbox (see virtual-mailboxes)  as  a  spool
              file.

       <b>wait_key</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls whether NeoMutt will ask you to press a key after an external command has been invoked by
              these  functions: &lt;shell-escape&gt;, &lt;pipe-message&gt;, &lt;pipe-entry&gt;, &lt;print-message&gt;, and &lt;print-entry&gt;
              commands.

              It is also used when viewing attachments with "auto_view", provided that the corresponding mailcap
              entry has a <u>needsterminal</u> flag, and the external program is interactive.

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will always ask for a key. When <u>unset</u>, NeoMutt will wait for a key only  if  the
              external command returned a non-zero status.

       <b>weed</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              When <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will weed headers when displaying, forwarding, or replying to messages.

              Also see $copy_decode_weed, $pipe_decode_weed, $print_decode_weed.

       <b>wrap</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 0

              When  set to a positive value, NeoMutt will wrap text at $wrap characters.  When set to a negative
              value, NeoMutt will wrap text so that there are $wrap characters of empty space on the right  side
              of the terminal. Setting it to zero makes NeoMutt wrap at the terminal width.

              Also see $reflow_wrap.

       <b>wrap_headers</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 78

              This  option specifies the number of characters to use for wrapping an outgoing message's headers.
              Allowed values are between 78 and 998 inclusive.

              <b>Note:</b> This option usually shouldn't be changed. RFC5233  recommends  a  line  length  of  78  (the
              default), so <b>please</b> <b>only</b> <b>change</b> <b>this</b> <b>setting</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you're</b> <b>doing</b>.

       <b>wrap_search</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: yes

              Controls whether searches wrap around the end.

              When  <u>set</u>,  searches  will  wrap around the first (or last) item. When <u>unset</u>, incremental searches
              will not wrap.

       <b>write_bcc</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              Controls whether NeoMutt writes out the "Bcc:" header when preparing messages to  be  sent.   Some
              MTAs,  such  as Exim and Courier, do not strip the "Bcc:" header; so it is advisable to leave this
              unset unless you have a particular need for the header to be in the sent message.

              If NeoMutt is set to deliver directly via SMTP(see $smtp_url), this option does  nothing:  NeoMutt
              will never write out the "Bcc:" header in this case.

              Note  this  option  only  affects the sending of messages.  Fcc'ed copies of a message will always
              contain the "Bcc:" header if one exists.

              <b>Note:</b> On Debian systems, exim4 and postfix strip BCC headers by default. The above warning applies
              to exim3 users, see /etc/neomuttrc.

       <b>write_inc</b>
              Type: number
              Default: 10

              When writing a mailbox, a message will be printed every $write_inc messages to indicate  progress.
              If set to 0, only a single message will be displayed before writing a mailbox.

              Also  see  the  $read_inc, $net_inc and $time_inc variables and the "tuning" section of the manual
              for performance considerations.

       <b>x_comment_to</b>
              Type: boolean
              Default: no

              If <u>set</u>, NeoMutt will add "X-Comment-To:" field  (that  contains  full  name  of  original  article
              author) to article that followuped to newsgroup.
