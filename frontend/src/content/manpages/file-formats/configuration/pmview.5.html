       <b>pmview</b> - configuration file format for performance views

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This man page describes version 2.1 of the <b>pmview</b> <b>(1)</b> configuration file format.

       The  configuration  format  supports  metrics  from multiple hosts or archives.  A configuration file can
       specify metrics without a source, with different hosts and different archives.  However, a  configuration
       file  that  contains  archives  may only have one archive for any one host.  When in ``replay'' mode, any
       metrics with host specific sources require an archive to be specified for that host on the  command  line
       or  as a source to a previous metric.  The archive must be the same archive (based on a string comparison
       of the archive names) of any archives specified in the configuration file for the same host.

       The time controls will list all hosts that are specified on the command line and the  configuration  file
       in the timezone listing (see <b><a href="../man1/pmtime.1.html">pmtime</a></b>(1)).

       The  configuration  file  format  is based on a two-dimensional grid which can contain a variety of bars,
       stacks, links, pipes, labels and other grids.  The grids resize each column and row to match the size  of
       the  largest  item  in  that  column or row.  A configuration file that contains only one object does not
       require a grid. The <b>pmview</b> configuration file starts with an identification  header  in  the  first  non-
       comment line:

          pmview Version 2.1 <u>[command_line]</u>

       The  optional  <u>command_line</u>  should  be  the  command  line  with  which  the  tool  was launched, if the
       configuration file has been generated by another tool.  This is useful for applications that  are  to  be
       restarted  automatically on the next login, after the user has logged out while <b>pmview</b> was still running.
       Care should be taken to ensure that the command specified is either a full pathname or will be  found  on
       the PATH available at login.

       All  lines  which  begin with ``#'' are treated as comments and ignored.  Otherwise, all spaces, tabs and
       newlines are treated as white space so multiple commands may be on the same line.

       The syntax for specifying values in the configuration file is consistent for all commands, namely:

       <u>color</u>
           A color must be either  one  of  the  20-or  so  <b>Qt</b>  color  names  (refer  to  the  QColor  class  at
           https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qcolor.html#predefined-colors),  or  an <b>HTML</b> hexadecimal color value (enclosed
           in quotes, e.g. "#ff6347"), or three normalized <u>real</u> values representing the saturation of red, green
           and blue.  For example, the following colors are identical:

               red
               "#ff0000"
               1.0 0.0 0.0

       <u>int</u> An integer.

       <u>metric</u>
           A metric consists of an optional source (host or archive), the metric name, an optional instance list
           immediately after name, followed by the maximum (or normalization value).  A colon (``:'') is used to
           separate a host name from the metric, and a forward slash (``/'') to separate an  archive  name  from
           the  metric.   Instances  are  enclosed in square brackets and comma separated.  Each instance may be
           enclosed in quotes.

           For example, some legal metrics are:

               kernel.all.cpu.idle 4000
               myhost:kernel.all.cpu.idle[cpu0,"cpu3"] 1000.0
               /path/to/myarchive/kernel.all.cpu.idle[cpu1] 1000

           To assist the process of matching instance names, two further comparisons are made  beyond  a  simple
           string comparison.  If the instance name contains spaces, only the first word in the instance name is
           required  to  match  the  instance, assuming that the first word is unique.  If the first word is not
           unique, only the first matching instance will be selected.  The second comparison occurs if the first
           word is a number with leading zeros.  Any leading zeros will be skipped before  comparing  the  first
           word  again.   This  permits  process  ids  used  in  the  <u>proc</u> metrics to be easily matched, without
           specifying the entire instance name.  For example, to visualize the user and system time of <u>init</u>  use
           the metric specification

               proc.psusage.utime[1]    1000
               proc.psusage.stime[1]    1000

       <u>name</u>
           A  name  for  an  object  which  may be referred to later in the configuration file.  Names must be a
           single word consisting of all alphanumeric characters, as well as underscores, dashes and colons.  It
           is recommended that names do not begin with an underscore as this may be interpreted as a keyword.

       <u>pos</u> This is the position of the object within the grid.  The syntax of a position is:

          [ [<u>x</u> <u>z</u>] [ [<u>width</u> <u>depth</u>] [<u>alignment</u>] ] ]

              <u>x</u>      The horizontal coordinate (left to right) of the object, starting at 0.  The default  <u>x</u>  is
                     0.

              <u>z</u>      The vertical coordinate (top to bottom) of the object, starting at 0.  The default <u>z</u> is 0.

              <u>width</u>  The number of columns occupied by the object.  The default <u>width</u> is 1.

              <u>depth</u>  The number of rows occupied by the object.  The default <u>depth</u> is 1.

              <u>alignment</u>
                     The  edge  or  corner that the object is aligned with.  Possible alignments include: <u>north</u>,
                     <u>south</u>, <u>east</u>, <u>west</u>, <u>northeast</u>, <u>northwest</u>, <u>southeast</u>, <u>southwest</u>  and  <u>center</u>.   Abbreviations
                     like <u>se</u> and <u>SE</u> are also accepted.  The default alignment is <u>center</u>.

                     The  size  of  an  object may not be known as the number of instances for some metrics will
                     vary between hosts and PMDA configurations.  Therefore, the position of the object  can  be
                     used  to  specify  the  likely  size of the object, so that the position of the surrounding
                     objects is appropriately adjusted.

                     The following are legal positions:

                     0 5    The object is centered at grid position 0,5 occupying 1 grid square.

                     1 2 north
                            The object is aligned with the north edge of position 1,2 occupying 1 grid square.

                     2 2 2 1 east
                            The object is aligned to the eastern edge  of  position  3,2  and  occupies  2  grid
                            squares (2,2 and 3,2).

       <u>string</u>
           A  string  is a series of characters enclosed in double quotes.  A string may not contain newlines or
           escaped double quotes.

       There are several parameters that may affect  the  size,  shape  and  color  of  objects  when  they  are
       displayed.   These parameters are scoped so that they only alter objects defined later in the same scope.
       Therefore, parameter settings at the top of a configuration file affect the entire scene, unless they are
       changed later in the file.  Most of these parameters are also resources.

       <b>_barLength</b> <u>int</u>
           The side length of the <b>_bar</b> and <b>_stack</b> blocks.  Default is 28.

       <b>_barHeight</b> <u>int</u>
           The maximum height of a <b>_bar</b> and <b>_stack</b> blocks.  Default is 80.

       <b>_baseColor</b> <u>color</u>
           The color of <b>_bar</b>, <b>_grid</b> and <b>_stack</b> base planes.  Default is "#262626" (i.e. gray15).

       <b>_baseHeight</b> <u>int</u>
           The height of <b>_bar</b>, <b>_grid</b> and <b>_stack</b> base planes.  Default is 2.

       <b>_gapWidth</b> <u>int</u>
           The gap between blocks in a <b>_bar</b> object in the X-axis.  The default is 8.

       <b>_gapDepth</b> <u>int</u>
           The gap between blocks in a <b>_bar</b> object in the Z-axis.  The default is 8.

       <b>_gapLabel</b> <u>int</u>
           The gap between the base of a <b>_bar</b> object, and any metric or instance labels.  The default is 6.

       <b>_gridWidth</b> <u>int</u>
           The minimum width of a <b>_grid</b> column.  The default is 20.

       <b>_gridDepth</b> <u>int</u>
           The minimum depth of a <b>_grid</b> row.  The default is 20.

       <b>_labelMargin</b> <u>int</u>
           The margin around a <b>_label</b> object.  The default is 5.

       <b>_labelColor</b> <u>color</u>
           The color of <b>_label</b> and <b>_bar</b> labels.  The default is white.

       <b>_marginWidth</b> <u>int</u>
           The extra width of a <b>_bar</b>, <b>_grid</b> and <b>_stack</b> base plane beyond the objects on the plane.  The  default
           is 8.

       <b>_marginDepth</b> <u>int</u>
           The  extra depth of a <b>_bar</b>, <b>_grid</b> and <b>_stack</b> base plane beyond the objects on the plane.  The default
           is 8.

       <b>_pipeLength</b> <u>int</u>
           Total length of a <b>_pipe.</b>  The default is the value of <b>_barHeight.</b>

       <b>_scale</b> <u>real</u>
           The scale applied to the entire scene.  This parameter may not be used within any  objects,  only  at
           the top of the configuration file.  The default is 1.0.

       To  simplify the specification of colors, a <b>_colorList</b> and a <b>_colorScale</b> may be used to define colors for
       an object which has metrics associated with it, i.e.  <b>_bar</b>, <b>_stack</b> or <b>_pipe</b>.  A color list may be defined
       within an object, or named and defined at the top of a configuration file.  A named color list  may  then
       be referenced within multiple objects:

       <b>_colorList</b> <u>name</u> <b>(</b> <u>color</u> [<u>color</u>...] <b>)</b>
           Associate  the  <u>color</u>s  with  the color list <u>name</u>.  The assignment of colors to blocks depends on the
           type of an object.  For example, the color list called <u>foo</u> has the same color three times:

           _colorList foo ( red "#ff0000" 1.0 0.0 0.0 )

       <b>_colorScale</b> <u>name</u> <u>color</u> <b>(</b> <u>color</u> <u>real</u> [<u>color</u> <u>real</u>...] <b>)</b>
           Associate the <u>color</u>s and <u>real</u>s with the color list <u>name</u>.  The initial <u>color</u> is the default  color  of
           the object.  The object will change color to the other colors when the normalized value of the object
           is  equal  to or greater than each <u>real</u>.  Therefore, each <u>real</u> must be larger than the previous <u>real</u>,
           and should be in the range 0.0 to 1.0.  This scale gradually changes from blue to red:

           _colorScale coldToHot blue ( "#7f00ff" 0.3
                                        purple 0.6
                                        "#ff007f" 0.8
                                        red 0.95)

       There are several different object types which could be found in a <b>pmview</b>  scene:  <b>_bar</b>,  <b>_stack</b>,  <b>_pipe</b>,
       <b>_grid</b>,  <b>_link</b>,  and  <b>_label</b>.  There is also <b>_xing</b> which is a special type of the <b>_link</b>.  The <b>_bar</b>, <b>_stack</b>
       and <b>_pipe</b> objects are modulated  by  metric  values,  a  <b>_label</b>  is  fixed  text,  <b>_link</b>  and  <b>_xing</b>  are
       interconnects  and  a  <b>_grid</b> is a container of objects, including other <b>_grid</b> objects, which controls the
       layout of the scene.  A <b>_grid</b> object is only required if there are two or more objects in the scene.

       <b>_bar</b>, <b>_grid</b> and <b>_stack</b> objects may have base planes which provide a point of reference for the blocks  as
       they change height.  A label can be applied to the base plane <b>_grid</b> object if it is <b>_shown</b> with:

               <b>_baseLabel</b> <u>name</u>|<u>string</u>

       <b>_baseLabel</b>  should  be  used  within  the  scope of the relevant <b>_bar</b>, <b>_grid</b> or <b>_stack</b> object.  The first
       ``\n'' characters in the string will be replaced by a new line.  Subsequent  ``\n''  characters  will  be
       ignored.

       For a scene to be valid it must contain at least one modulated object.

       The objects are defined as:

       <b>_bar</b> [<u>options</u>] <b>(</b> [<u>metric-list</u>] [<u>color-list</u>] [<u>label-list</u>] <b>)</b>
           A  <b>_bar</b>  object  represents  a  collection  of blocks.  The number of blocks depends on the number of
           metrics and metric instances assigned to the  object.   By  default,  the  blocks  are  modulated  by
           changing the height of each block.  Alternatively, blocks may be modulated by changing color, or both
           height  and  color.   Each  color  in the <u>color-list</u> is assigned to each metric.  Therefore, multiple
           instances of the one metric will have the same color.  The <u>options</u> that  may  be  passed  to  a  <b>_bar</b>
           object are:

           <u>pos</u> The position of the <b>_bar</b> object within the current <b>_grid</b> object.

           <b>_col</b>|<b>_row</b>
               Position  the  blocks  so that each instance is in a column (<b>_col</b>) or a row (<b>_row</b>).  This implies
               that each different metric is in a separate row or column, respectively.  The default is <b>_col</b>.

           <b>_show</b>|<b>_hide</b>
               Is the base plane visible? Default is <b>_show</b>.

           <b>_ymod</b>|<b>_colormod</b>|<b>_colorymod</b>
               Modulate the blocks by adjusting their height (<b>_ymod</b>), color (<b>_colormod</b>) or both height and color
               (<b>_colorymod</b>).

           <b>_cube</b>|<b>_cylinder</b>
               Set the shape of the blocks.  The default is <b>_cube</b>.

           <b>_groupbymetric</b>|<b>_groupbyinst</b>|<b>_groupbyrow|</b>|<b>groupbycol</b>
               Set the grouping of blocks when launching other tools. For tools like <b><a href="../man1/pmchart.1.html">pmchart</a></b>(1) some  views  may
               generate  many small charts which cannot be drawn entirely within the screen.  Another problem is
               it may be more appropriate to generate charts with the same instance in each chart,  rather  then
               the  same  metric.  The group specifiers control the algorithm used so that a separate chart will
               be drawn for each <b>_metrics</b> specification (<b>_groupbymetric</b>), for the first, second etc. instance of
               each <b>_metric</b> (<b>_groupbyinst</b>), or by the rows and columns of the <b>_bar</b> object depending on  <b>_row</b>  or
               <b>_col</b>.  The default is <b>_groupbymetric</b>.

           The options must be specified in this order, although preceding options are not required.  Therefore,
           this is legal:

               _bar _hide _cylinder ( ... )

           The  metrics, colors and labels are specified within the brackets in any order.  Only the <u>metric-list</u>
           is mandatory.

           <u>metric-list</u>
               A <b>_bar</b> metric list contains a list of metric names, normalization values and  an  optional  label
               for the metric:

               <b>_metrics</b> <b>(</b> <u>metric</u> <u>real</u> [<u>string</u>] [<u>metric</u> <u>real</u> [<u>string</u>]...] <b>)</b>

           <u>color-list</u>
               A  <b>_bar</b>  color list may be a named color list that was defined earlier, or an unnamed color list.
               A <b>_colorScale</b> list should be used when using <b>_colormod</b> or <b>_colorymod</b> modulation.  Therefore,  the
               syntax for color lists within a <b>_bar</b> object are any of:

               <b>_colorList</b> <u>name</u>
               <b>_colorList</b> <b>(</b> <u>color</u> [<u>color</u>...] <b>)</b>
               <b>_colorScale</b> <u>name</u>
               <b>_colorScale</b> <u>color</u> <b>(</b> <u>color</u> <u>real</u> [<u>color</u> <u>real</u>...] <b>)</b>

           <u>label-list</u>
               In  addition  to  labels  for  each  metric in the <u>metric-list</u>, metric and instance labels may be
               defined using <b>_metriclabels</b> and <b>_instlabels</b> statements.  The position of the  labels  around  the
               <b>_bar</b>  object  depends  on  the <b>_row</b> or <b>_col</b> orientation of metrics and instances, and whether the
               label is read <b>_towards</b> the <b>_bar</b> object, or <b>_away</b>.  The default is <b>_towards</b>.

               <b>_metriclabels</b> [<b>_away</b>|<b>_towards</b>] <b>(</b> <u>name</u>|<u>string</u> [<u>name</u>|<u>string</u>...] <b>)</b>
               <b>_instlabels</b> [<b>_away</b>|<b>_towards</b>] <b>(</b> <u>name</u>|<u>string</u>
               [<u>name</u>|<u>string</u>...] <b>)</b>

       <b>_grid</b> [<u>pos</u>] [<b>_show</b>|<b>_hide</b>] <b>(</b> <u>objects</u> <b>)</b>
           A <b>_grid</b> object is a container for objects, including other <b>_grid</b> objects.  The rows and columns of  a
           <b>_grid</b>  object  are  resized  to the largest object in the row or column.  If an object spans multiple
           rows and/or columns, those rows and columns may be partly resized to contain  the  object.   However,
           the  resizing  of  rows  and  columns  for  objects  occupying multiple rows and columns occurs after
           resizing for objects occupying only one grid square.

           A collision between objects occupying the same squares will be reported as an error message  and  the
           later object will be ignored.

           The options to a <b>_grid</b> object control the position (<u>pos</u>) of the <b>_grid</b> object in the parent <b>_grid</b>, and
           indicate whether to <b>_show</b> or <b>_hide</b> the <b>_grid</b> base plane.  By default, the base plane is hidden.

           The  parameters  described above may be specified within the brackets of a <b>_grid</b> object, however they
           only apply to the objects within the <b>_grid</b>, not the <b>_grid</b> itself.  For a parameter to be applied to a
           <b>_grid</b> object, it must be specified before the <b>_grid</b> object declaration.

       <b>_label</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>string</u>
           A <b>_label</b> object draws the contexts of <u>string</u> at the location, orientation and size specified  in  the
           <u>options</u>:

           <u>pos</u> The position of the <b>_label</b> object in the current <b>_grid</b> object.

           <b>_left</b>|<b>_right</b>|<b>_up</b>|<b>_down</b>
               The  orientation  of  the  <u>string</u>.   The  direction  indicates  the  direction the label is read.
               Therefore, <b>_right</b> is the default since the string is read from left to right.

           <b>_small</b>|<b>_medium</b>|<b>_large</b>
               The font size.  The default is <b>_medium</b>.

       <b>_link</b> <u>pos</u> [<u>string</u>]
           A <b>_link</b> object draws a straight or L-shaped horizontal round ``pipe'' with diameter equal to  80%  of
           the <b>_</b><u>baseHeight</u> of an enclosing <b>_grid</b>.  The properties of the object are defined by the options:

           <u>pos</u> sets  both  the  position of the <b>_link</b> on the grid and its shape.  <b>_link</b> starts in the column and
               row on the <b>_grid</b> specified by first two numbers in the <u>pos</u> and spans the number  of  columns  and
               rows  set by the second two numbers. The <u>alignment</u> value is used to decide the orientation of the
               link (links are always aligned at the center): <u>east</u> and <u>west</u> links are straight  and  going  from
               left to right, <u>north</u> and <u>south</u> links are straight and going from far end of the grid to near end,
               <u>northeast,</u>  <u>northwest,</u>  <u>southeast</u>  and <u>southwest</u> links are L-shaped and connect the corresponding
               points of the compass, i.e. a <u>northeast</u> link takes on the  general  shape  of  the  Latin  letter
               ``L''.

           <u>string</u>
               sets  the  ``tag''  for  the <b>_link</b> which will be displayed in the text window when the pointer is
               over the link.

       <b>_pipe</b> <u>pos</u> <b>(</b> [<u>metric-list</u>] [<u>color-list</u>] [<u>tag</u>] <b>)</b>
           A <b>_pipe</b> object represent a set of cylinders, placed on top of each other and oriented parallel to the
           base plane. The diameter of a <b>_pipe</b> is equal  to  80%  of  <b>_</b><u>baseHeight</u>.   The  number  of  blocks  is
           dependent  on  the  number  of metric instances in the <u>metric-list</u>.  The colors in the <u>color-list</u> are
           assigned in turn to each cylinder in  the  <b>_pipe</b>.   The  length  of  the  <b>_pipe</b>  is  defined  by  the
           <b>_</b><u>pipeLength</u>.

           <u>pos</u> defines the position of the <b>_pipe</b> on the enclosing <b>_grid</b> and its orientation with <u>alignment</u> field
               used to define at which end of the pipe to stack the colored cylinders. The cylinders are stacked
               at  the  corresponding  point  of  the  compass and the pipe's direction is from the point of the
               compass towards the center of the compass.  Only <u>east</u>, <u>west</u>, <u>north</u>, and <u>south</u>  are  valid  values
               for the pipe's alignment.

       The metrics, colors and label may be specified within the brackets in any order.  Only the <u>metric-list</u> is
       mandatory.

       <u>metric-list</u>
           A <b>_pipe</b> metric list contains a list of metric names and normalization values:

           <b>_metrics</b> <b>(</b> <u>metric</u> <u>real</u> [<u>metric</u> <u>real</u>...] <b>)</b>

       <u>color-list</u>
           A <b>_pipe</b> color list may be named color list that was defined earlier, or an unnamed color list:

           <b>_colorList</b> <u>name</u>
           <b>_colorList</b> <b>(</b> <u>color</u> [<u>color</u>...] <b>)</b>

       <u>tag</u> A  <b>_pipe</b>  may have a ``tag'' for the filler block (unanimated block on the ``other'' end of the pipe)
           which will be displayed in the text window when the pointer is over that end of the pipe.

           <b>_pipeTag</b> <u>name</u>|<u>string</u>

       <b>_stack</b> [<u>options</u>] <b>(</b> [<u>metric-list</u>] [<u>color-list</u>] [<u>label</u>] <b>)</b>
           A <b>_stack</b> object represents a set of blocks placed vertically on top of each  other.   The  number  of
           blocks  is  dependent on the number of metric instances in the <u>metric-list</u>.  The colors in the <u>color-</u>
           <u>list</u> are assigned to each block in the <b>_stack</b>.  By default, the height of the <b>_stack</b> will be the  sum
           of the height of each block.  The <u>options</u> that may be passed to a <b>_stack</b> object are:

           <u>pos</u> The position of the <b>_stack</b> object within the current <b>_grid</b> object.

           <b>_show</b>|<b>_hide</b>
               Is the base plane visible? Default is <b>_show</b>.

           <b>_utilmod</b>|<b>_fillmod</b>
               Force  the  height of the stack to always be the maximum height.  This is achieved by normalizing
               the height of each block (<b>_utilmod</b>), or  by  adding  a  grey  block  to  the  top  of  the  stack
               (<b>_fillmod</b>).

           <b>_cube</b>|<b>_cylinder</b>
               Set the shape of the blocks.  The default is <b>_cube</b>.

           The options must be specified in this order, although preceding options are not required.  Therefore,
           this is legal:

               _stack 1 1 _north _utilmod ( ... )

           The  metrics,  colors  and label may be specified within the brackets in any order.  Only the <u>metric-</u>
           <u>list</u> is mandatory.

           <u>metric-list</u>
               A <b>_stack</b> metric list contains a list of metric names and normalization values:

               <b>_metrics</b> <b>(</b> <u>metric</u> <u>real</u> [<u>metric</u> <u>real</u>...] <b>)</b>

           <u>color-list</u>
               A <b>_stack</b> color list may be named color list that was defined earlier, or an unnamed color list:

               <b>_colorList</b> <u>name</u>
               <b>_colorList</b> <b>(</b> <u>color</u> [<u>color</u>...] <b>)</b>

           <u>label</u>
               A <b>_fillmod</b> type <b>_stack</b> may have a label for the filler block:

               <b>_stackLabel</b> <u>name</u>|<u>string</u>

       <b>_xing</b> <u>col</u> <u>row</u> <u>columns</u> <u>rows</u> <u>dir1</u> ... <u>dir4</u>
           A <b>_xing</b> is a special kind of link which is used to draw a pair of links which cross  each  other.  To
           convey  the  visual  impression that the links do not join, one of the links is drawn as a ``broken''
           cylinder.  <u>col</u> and <u>row</u> define the position on the enclosing grid.  <u>columns</u> and <u>rows</u> define  the  size
           of the bounding box. The end points of the crossing cylinders are placed exactly in the center of the
           corner  cells of the bounding box and four small cylinders or stubs are used to join the perimeter of
           the bounding box with the  end  points  on  the  crossing  cylinders.  Four  <u>dir</u>  values  define  the
           orientation  of  the  stubs, starting at the upper left corner of the <b>_xing</b> and proceeding clockwise,
           such that respective stubs are used to join the point of the compass with the center on the cell (see
           example).
