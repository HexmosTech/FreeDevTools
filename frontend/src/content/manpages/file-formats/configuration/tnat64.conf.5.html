</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tnat64.conf</b> - configuration file for <a href="../man8/tnat64.8.html">tnat64</a>(8)

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration  for  tnat64 can be anything from two lines to hundreds of lines based on the needs at
       any particular site. The basic idea is to define any networks the machine can access  directly  via  IPv4
       and define one or many NAT64 prefixes to be used to access other networks (including a 'default' prefix).

       Local  networks  are  declared  using  the  'local'  keyword in the configuration file. When applications
       attempt to connect to machines in networks marked as local tnat64 will not attempt to use a NAT64 prefix.

       Obviously if a connection is not to a locally accessible network it will need to be proxied over a NAT64.
       However, sometimes you may need to use  different  NAT64  prefixes  to  access  different  internal  (and
       external)  networks. For this reason the configuration file allows the definition of 'paths' as well as a
       default NAT64 prefix.

       Paths are declared as blocks in the configuration file. That is, they begin with a 'path {' line  in  the
       configuration  file  and  end  with  a '}' line. Inside this block directives should be used to declare a
       NAT64 proxy (as documented later in this manual page) and 'subnet' directives should be used  to  declare
       networks  and  even  destination ports in those networks that this server should be used to reach. Please
       note that each path MUST define a NAT64 prefix and contain one or more 'subnet' directives.

       NAT64 prefix declaration directives that are not contained within a 'path' block define the default NAT64
       prefix. If tnat64 needs to connect to a machine via a NAT64 (i.e it isn't a network declared as  'local')
       and  no 'path' has declared it can reach that network via a 'subnet' directive, this NAT64 prefix is used
       to construct IPv6 addresses.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The basic structure of all lines in the configuration file is:

              &lt;directive&gt; = &lt;parameters&gt;

       The exception to this is 'path' blocks which look like:

              path {
                     &lt;directive&gt; = &lt;parameters&gt;
              }

       Empty lines are ignored and all input on a line after a '#' character is ignored.

   <b>DIRECTIVES</b>
       The following directives are used in the tnat64 configuration file:

       <u>nat64_prefix</u>
              The prefix of IPv6 address of the NAT64 (e.g. "nat64_prefix = 64:ff9b::"). Only one  NAT64  prefix
              may be specified per path block, or one outside a path block (to define the default NAT64 prefix).
              The NAT64 prefix is always /96.

       <u>local</u>  An  IP/subnet  pair  specifying  a network which may be accessed directly without proxying through
              NAT64 (e.g "local = 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0").

       <u>subnet</u> This  directive  is  only  valid   inside   a   path   block.   Its   parameter   is   formed   as
              IP[:startport[-endport]]/subnet  and it specifies a network (and a range of ports on that network)
              that can be accessed by through NAT64 specified in this path block. For example, in a  path  block
              "subnet  = 150.0.0.0:80-1024/255.0.0.0" indicates to tnat64 that the NAT64 prefix specified in the
              current path block should be used to access any IPs in the range 150.0.0.0 to 150.255.255.255 when
              the connection request is for ports 80-1024.

</pre><h4><b>UTILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       tnat64 comes with two utilities that can be useful in creating and  verifying  the  tnat64  configuration
       file.

       tnat64-validateconf
              tnat64-validateconf can be used to verify the configuration file. It checks the format of the file
              and also the contents for errors. Having read the file it dumps the configuration to the screen in
              a formatted, readable manner. This can be extremely useful in debugging problems.

              tnat64-validateconf  can  read  a  configuration  file  from  a  location  other than the location
              specified at compile time with the -f &lt;filename&gt; command line option.

              Normally tnat64-validateconf simply dumps the configuration  read  to  the  screen  (in  a  nicely
              readable  format),  however  it  also  has  a useful 'test' mode. When passed a hostname/ip on the
              command line like -t &lt;hostname/ip&gt;, tnat64-validateconf determines which  of  the  NAT64  prefixes
              specified in the configuration file would be used by tnat64 to access the specified host.
