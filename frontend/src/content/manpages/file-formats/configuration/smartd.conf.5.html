</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>smartd.conf</b> - SMART Disk Monitoring Daemon Configuration File

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       [This man page is generated for the Linux version of smartmontools.  It does not contain info specific to
       other platforms.]

       <b>/etc/smartd.conf</b> is the configuration file for the <b>smartd</b> daemon.

       If  the  configuration  file  <b>/etc/smartd.conf</b>  is  present,  <b>smartd</b>  reads  it  at  startup.   If <b>smartd</b>
       subsequently receives a <b>HUP</b> signal, it will then re-read the configuration file.  If <b>smartd</b> is running in
       debug mode, then an <b>INT</b> signal will also make it re-read the configuration  file.   This  signal  can  be
       generated by typing <b>&lt;CONTROL-C&gt;</b> in the terminal window where <b>smartd</b> is running.

       In  the  absence of a configuration file <b>smartd</b> will try to open all available devices (see <b><a href="../man8/smartd.8.html">smartd</a></b>(8) man
       page).  A configuration file with a single line <b>'DEVICESCAN</b> <b>-a'</b> would have the same effect.

       This can be annoying if you have an ATA or SCSI device that hangs  or  misbehaves  when  receiving  SMART
       commands.   Even if this causes no problems, you may be annoyed by the string of error log messages about
       devices that can't be opened.

       One can avoid this problem, and gain more control over the types of events monitored by <b>smartd</b>, by  using
       the  configuration  file  <b>/etc/smartd.conf</b>.   This  file  contains a list of devices to monitor, with one
       device per line.  An example file is included with the <b>smartmontools</b> distribution.  You  will  find  this
       sample  configuration file in <b>/usr/share/doc/smartmontools/</b>.  For security, the configuration file should
       not be writable by anyone but root.  The syntax of the file is as follows:

       •   There should be one device listed per line, although you may have lines that are entirely comments or
           white space.

       •   Any text following a hash sign '#' and up to the end of the line  is  taken  to  be  a  comment,  and
           ignored.

       •   Lines  may  be continued by using a backslash '\' as the last non-whitespace or non-comment item on a
           line.

       •   Note: a line whose first character is a hash sign '#' is treated as a white-space blank line, <b>not</b>  as
           a non-existent line, and will <b>end</b> a continuation line.

       Here  is  an  example configuration file.  It's for illustrative purposes only; please don't copy it onto
       your system without reading to the end of the <b>DIRECTIVES</b> Section below!

       ################################################

       <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>cciss</b> <b>controller</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> then the corresponding block device (/dev/sd?) must be listed,  along  with
       the ´-d cciss,N´ Directive (see below).

       <b>DEVICESCAN</b>
              If a non-comment entry in the configuration file is the text string <b>DEVICESCAN</b> in capital letters,
              then  <b>smartd</b> will ignore any remaining lines in the configuration file, and will scan for devices.
              If <b>DEVICESCAN</b> is not followed by any Directives, then '-a' will apply to all devices.

       <b>DEVICESCAN</b> may optionally be followed by Directives that will apply to all devices that are found in  the
       scan.  For example

         DEVICESCAN -m <a href="mailto:root@example.com">root@example.com</a>

       will  scan  for  all  devices,  and then monitor them.  It will send one email warning per device for any
       problems that are found.

         DEVICESCAN -H -m <a href="mailto:root@example.com">root@example.com</a>

       will do the same, but only monitors the SMART health status of the devices, rather than the default '-a'.

       Multiple '-d TYPE' options may be specified with DEVICESCAN to combine the scan results of more than  one
       TYPE.

       Configuration entries for specific devices may precede the <b>DEVICESCAN</b> entry.  For example

         DEFAULT -m <a href="mailto:root@example.com">root@example.com</a>
         /dev/sda -s S/../.././02
         /dev/sdc -d ignore
         DEVICESCAN -s L/../.././02

       will  scan for all devices except /dev/sda and /dev/sdc, monitor them, and run a long test between 2–3 am
       every morning.  Device /dev/sda will also be monitored, but only  a  short  test  will  be  run.   Device
       /dev/sdc will be ignored.  Warning emails will be sent for all monitored devices.

       A  device  is  ignored  by DEVICESCAN if a configuration line with the same device name exists.  Symbolic
       links are resolved before this check is done.  A device name is also ignored if another device with  same
       identify information (vendor, model, firmware version, serial number, WWN) already exists.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       If  an  entry in the configuration file starts with <b>DEFAULT</b> instead of a device name, then all directives
       in this entry are set as defaults for the next device entries.

       This configuration:

         DEFAULT -a -R5! -W 2,40,45 -I 194 -s L/../../7/00 -m <a href="mailto:admin@example.com">admin@example.com</a>
         /dev/sda
         /dev/sdb
         /dev/sdc
         DEFAULT -H -m <a href="mailto:admin@example.com">admin@example.com</a>
         /dev/sdd
         /dev/sde -d removable

       has the same effect as:

         /dev/sda -a -R5! -W 2,40,45 -I 194 -s L/../../7/00 -m <a href="mailto:admin@example.com">admin@example.com</a>
         /dev/sdb -a -R5! -W 2,40,45 -I 194 -s L/../../7/00 -m <a href="mailto:admin@example.com">admin@example.com</a>
         /dev/sdc -a -R5! -W 2,40,45 -I 194 -s L/../../7/00 -m <a href="mailto:admin@example.com">admin@example.com</a>
         /dev/sdd -H -m <a href="mailto:admin@example.com">admin@example.com</a>
         /dev/sde -d removable -H -m <a href="mailto:admin@example.com">admin@example.com</a>

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b></h4><pre>
       The following are the Directives that may appear following the device name or <b>DEVICESCAN</b>  or  <b>DEFAULT</b>  on
       any  line  of  the <b>/etc/smartd.conf</b> configuration file.  Note that <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>command-line</b> <b>options</b> <b>for</b>
       <b>smartd</b>.  The Directives below may appear in any order, following the device name.

       <b>For</b> <b>an</b> <b>ATA</b> <b>device,</b> if no Directives appear, then the device will be monitored as if  the  '-a'  Directive
       (monitor all SMART properties) had been given.

       <b>If</b>  <b>a</b>  <b>SCSI</b>  <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> <b>listed,</b> it will be monitored at the maximum implemented level: roughly equivalent to
       using the '-H -l selftest' options for an ATA disk.  So with the exception of '-d', '-m', '-l  selftest',
       '-s',  and  '-M',  the  Directives  below are ignored for SCSI disks.  For SCSI disks, the '-m' Directive
       sends a warning email if the SMART status indicates a disk failure or problem, if the SCSI inquiry  about
       disk status fails, or if new errors appear in the self-test log.

       <b>If</b>  <b>a</b>  <b>3ware</b>  <b>controller</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>used</b> then the corresponding SCSI (/dev/sd?) or character device (/dev/twe?,
       /dev/twa?, /dev/twl? or /dev/tws?) must be listed, along with the '-d  3ware,N'  Directive  (see  below).
       The  individual  ATA  disks hosted by the 3ware controller appear to <b>smartd</b> as normal ATA devices.  Hence
       all the ATA directives can be used for these disks (but see note below).

       <b>If</b> <b>an</b> <b>Areca</b> <b>controller</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> then the corresponding device (SCSI /dev/sg? on Linux or  /dev/arcmsr0  on
       FreeBSD)  must  be  listed, along with the '-d areca,N' Directive (see below).  The individual SATA disks
       hosted by the Areca controller appear to <b>smartd</b> as normal ATA devices.  Hence all the ATA directives  can
       be used for these disks.  Areca firmware version 1.46 or later which supports smartmontools must be used;
       Please see the <b><a href="../man8/smartctl.8.html">smartctl</a></b>(8) man page for further details.

       <b>-d</b> <b>TYPE</b>
              Specifies the type of the device.  The valid arguments to this directive are:

              <u>auto</u> - attempt to guess the device type from the device name or from controller type info provided
              by  the  operating  system  or  from  a  matching USB ID entry in the drive database.  This is the
              default.

              <u>ata</u> - the device type is ATA.  This prevents <b>smartd</b> from issuing SCSI commands to an ATA device.

              <u>scsi</u> - the device type is SCSI.  This prevents <b>smartd</b> from issuing ATA commands to a SCSI device.

              <u>nvme[,NSID]</u> - the device type is NVM Express (NVMe).  The optional parameter  NSID  specifies  the
              namespace  id  (in hex) passed to the driver.  Use 0xffffffff for the broadcast namespace id.  The
              default for NSID is the namespace id addressed by the device name.

              <u>sat[,auto][,N]</u> - the device type is SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT).  This is  for  ATA  disks  that
              have  a  SCSI  to  ATA  Translation  Layer  (SATL) between the disk and the operating system.  SAT
              defines two ATA PASS THROUGH SCSI commands, one 12 bytes long and the other 16  bytes  long.   The
              default is the 16 byte variant which can be overridden with either '-d sat,12' or '-d sat,16'.

              If  '-d  sat,auto'  is  specified,  device  type SAT (for ATA/SATA disks) is only used if the SCSI
              INQUIRY data reports a SATL (VENDOR: "ATA     ").  Otherwise device type SCSI (for SCSI/SAS disks)
              is used.

              <u>usbasm1352r,PORT</u> - [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD 7.4 FEATURE] this device type is for one or  two  SATA
              disks  that are behind an ASMedia ASM1352R USB to SATA (RAID) bridge.  The parameter PORT (0 or 1)
              selects the disk to monitor.
              Note: This USB bridge also supports '-d sat'.  This monitors either the first disk or  the  second
              disk if no disk is connected to the first port.

              <u>usbcypress</u> - this device type is for ATA disks that are behind a Cypress USB to PATA bridge.  This
              will  use  the  ATACB  proprietary  scsi pass through command.  The default SCSI operation code is
              0x24, but although it can be overridden with '-d usbcypress,0xN', where N is  the  scsi  operation
              code, you're running the risk of damage to the device or filesystems on it.

              <u>usbjmicron[,p][,x][,PORT]</u>  -  this  device type is for SATA disks that are behind a JMicron USB to
              PATA/SATA bridge.  The 48-bit ATA commands (required e.g. for '-l xerror', see below) do not  work
              with all of these bridges and are therefore disabled by default.  These commands can be enabled by
              '-d  usbjmicron,x'.   If  two  disks are connected to a bridge with two ports, an error message is
              printed if no PORT (0 or 1) is specified.
              The PORT parameter is not necessary if the device uses a port multiplier to connect multiple disks
              to one port.  The disks appear under separate /dev/ice names then.
              CAUTION: Specifying ',x' for a device which does not support it results  in  I/O  errors  and  may
              disconnect  the  drive.  The same applies if the specified PORT does not exist or is not connected
              to a disk.

              The Prolific PL2507/3507 USB bridges with older firmware support a pass-through command similar to
              JMicron and work with '-d usbjmicron,0'.  Newer Prolific  firmware  requires  a  modified  command
              which  can be selected by '-d usbjmicron,p'.  Note that this does not yet support the SMART status
              command.

              <u>usbprolific</u> - this device type is for SATA disks that are behind a Prolific  PL2571/2771/2773/2775
              USB to SATA bridge.

              <u>usbsunplus</u> - this device type is for SATA disks that are behind a SunplusIT USB to SATA bridge.

              <u>sntasmedia</u>  -  [NEW  EXPERIMENTAL  SMARTD 7.3 FEATURE] this device type is for NVMe disks that are
              behind an ASMedia USB to NVMe bridge.

              <u>sntjmicron[,NSID]</u> - this device type is for NVMe disks that are  behind  a  JMicron  USB  to  NVMe
              bridge.   The  optional  parameter  NSID specifies the namespace id (in hex) passed to the driver.
              The default namespace id is the broadcast namespace id (0xffffffff).

              <u>sntrealtek</u> - this device type is for NVMe disks that are behind a Realtek USB to NVMe bridge.

              <u>marvell</u> - [Linux only] (deprecated and subject to remove).

              <u>megaraid,N</u> - [FreeBSD and Linux only] the device consists of one or more SCSI/SAS disks  connected
              to a MegaRAID controller.  The non-negative integer N (in the range of 0 to 127 inclusive) denotes
              which  disk  on  the  controller  is  monitored.   This  interface  will  also  work for Dell PERC
              controllers.  In log files and email messages this disk will be  identified  as  megaraid_disk_XXX
              with  XXX in the range from 000 to 127 inclusive.  Please see the <b><a href="../man8/smartctl.8.html">smartctl</a></b>(8) man page for further
              details.

              <u>aacraid,H,L,ID</u> - [Linux, Windows and Cygwin only] the device consists of one or more  SCSI/SAS  or
              SATA  disks  connected  to  an AacRaid controller.  The non-negative integers H,L,ID (Host number,
              Lun, ID) denote which disk on the controller is monitored.  In log files and email  messages  this
              disk will be identified as aacraid_disk_HH_LL_ID.  Please see the <b><a href="../man8/smartctl.8.html">smartctl</a></b>(8) man page for further
              details.

              <u>3ware,N</u>  -  [FreeBSD  and  Linux only] the device consists of one or more ATA disks connected to a
              3ware RAID controller.  The non-negative integer N (in the range from 0 to 127 inclusive)  denotes
              which  disk  on  the  controller  is monitored.  In log files and email messages this disk will be
              identified as 3ware_disk_XXX with XXX in the range from 000 to 127 inclusive.

              Note that while you may use <b>any</b> of the 3ware SCSI logical devices /dev/tw* to address <b>any</b>  of  the
              physical  disks  (3ware ports), error and log messages will make the most sense if you always list
              the 3ware SCSI logical device corresponding to the particular  physical  disks.   Please  see  the
              <b><a href="../man8/smartctl.8.html">smartctl</a></b>(8) man page for further details.

              <u>areca,N</u>  - [FreeBSD, Linux, Windows and Cygwin only] the device consists of one or more SATA disks
              connected to an Areca SATA RAID controller.  The positive integer N (in the range  from  1  to  24
              inclusive)  denotes  which  disk  on the controller is monitored.  In log files and email messages

              present  when  <b>smartd</b>  is started.  This directive also suppresses warning emails and repeated log
              messages if the device is removed after startup.  This Directive may be used in  conjunction  with
              the other '-d' Directives.
              <b>WARNING:</b>  <b>Removing</b>  <b>a</b> <b>device</b> <b>and</b> <b>connecting</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>same</b> <b>interface</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> <b>and</b>
              <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>bogus</b> <b>warnings</b> <b>until</b> <b>smartd</b> <b>is</b> <b>restarted.</b>

       <b>-n</b> <b>POWERMODE[,N][,q]</b>
              [ATA only] This 'nocheck' Directive is used to prevent a  disk  from  being  spun-up  when  it  is
              periodically polled by <b>smartd</b>.

              ATA  disks  have  five different power states.  In order of increasing power consumption they are:
              'OFF', 'SLEEP', 'STANDBY', 'IDLE', and 'ACTIVE'.  Typically in the OFF, SLEEP, and  STANDBY  modes
              the  disk's  platters  are  not  spinning.   But  usually, in response to SMART commands issued by
              <b>smartd</b>, the disk platters are spun up.  So if this option is not used, then a disk which is  in  a
              low-power  mode  may be spun up and put into a higher-power mode when it is periodically polled by
              <b>smartd</b>.

              Note that if the disk is in SLEEP mode when <b>smartd</b> is started, then it  won't  respond  to  <b>smartd</b>
              commands,  and so the disk won't be registered as a device for <b>smartd</b> to monitor.  If a disk is in
              any other low-power mode, then the commands issued by <b>smartd</b> to register the  disk  will  probably
              cause it to spin-up.

              The  '<b>-n</b>'  (nocheck)  Directive  specifies if <b>smartd</b>'s periodic checks should still be carried out
              when the device is in a low-power mode.  It may be used to prevent a disk from  being  spun-up  by
              periodic <b>smartd</b> polling.  The allowed values of POWERMODE are:

              <u>never</u>  -  <b>smartd</b> will poll (check) the device regardless of its power mode.  This may cause a disk
              which is spun-down to be spun-up when <b>smartd</b> checks it.  This is the default behavior if the  '-n'
              Directive is not given.

              <u>sleep</u> - check the device unless it is in SLEEP mode.

              <u>standby</u>  -  check the device unless it is in SLEEP or STANDBY mode.  In these modes most disks are
              not spinning, so if you want to prevent a laptop disk from  spinning  up  each  time  that  <b>smartd</b>
              polls, this is probably what you want.

              <u>idle</u>  -  check  the  device  unless it is in SLEEP, STANDBY or IDLE mode.  In the IDLE state, most
              disks are still spinning, so this is probably not what you want.

              Maximum number of skipped checks (in a row) can be specified by appending positive number ',N'  to
              POWERMODE  (like  '-n standby,15').  After N checks are skipped in a row, powermode is ignored and
              the check is performed anyway.

              When a periodic test is skipped, <b>smartd</b> normally writes an informal log message.  The message  can
              be  suppressed  by  appending the option ',q' to POWERMODE (like '-n standby,q').  This prevents a
              laptop disk from spinning up due to this message.

              Both ',N' and ',q' can be specified together.

       <b>-T</b> <b>TYPE</b>
              Specifies how tolerant <b>smartd</b> should be of SMART command failures.  The valid  arguments  to  this
              Directive are:

              <u>normal</u>  -  do  not  try to monitor the disk if a mandatory SMART command fails, but continue if an
              optional SMART command fails.  This is the default.

              <u>permissive</u> - try to monitor the disk even if it appears to lack SMART capabilities.  This  may  be
              required  for  some  old disks (prior to ATA-3 revision 4) that implemented SMART before the SMART
              standards were incorporated into the  ATA/ATAPI  Specifications.   [Please  see  the  <b>smartctl</b>  <b>-T</b>
              command-line option.]

       <b>-o</b> <b>VALUE</b>
              [ATA  only]  Enables  or disables SMART Automatic Offline Testing when <b>smartd</b> starts up and has no
              further effect.  The valid arguments to this Directive are <u>on</u> and <u>off</u>.

              The delay between tests is vendor-specific, but is typically four hours.

              Note that SMART Automatic Offline Testing is <b>not</b> part of the ATA Specification.   Please  see  the
              <b>smartctl</b> <b>-o</b> command-line option documentation for further information about this feature.

       <b>-S</b> <b>VALUE</b>
              Enables or disables Attribute Autosave when <b>smartd</b> starts up and has no further effect.  The valid
              arguments  to this Directive are <u>on</u> and <u>off</u>.  Also affects SCSI devices.  [Please see the <b>smartctl</b>
              <b>-S</b> command-line option.]

       <b>-H</b>     [ATA] Check the health status of the disk with the SMART RETURN STATUS command.  If  this  command
              reports  a  failing  health  status,  then  disk failure is predicted in less than 24 hours, and a
              message at loglevel <b>'LOG_CRIT'</b> will be logged to syslog.  [Please see the <b>smartctl</b> <b>-H</b> command-line
              option.]

              [NVMe] Checks the "Critical Warning" byte from the SMART/Health Information log.  If  any  warning
              bit is set, a message at loglevel <b>'LOG_CRIT'</b> will be logged to syslog.

       <b>-l</b> <b>TYPE</b>
              Reports increases in the number of errors in one of three SMART logs.  The valid arguments to this
              Directive are:

              <u>error</u>  -  [ATA]  report  if  the  number of ATA errors reported in the Summary SMART error log has
              increased since the last check.

              <u>error</u> - [NVMe] report if the "Number of Error  Information  Log  Entries"  from  the  SMART/Health
              Information log has increased since the last check.
              [NEW  EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD 7.4 FEATURE] This will only be logged as LOG_CRIT if at least one of the
              new errors is still present in the Error Information log and its status indicates a device related
              error.  Up to eight of the most recent of these errors are  logged  as  LOG_INFO  then.   This  is
              useful  because  the  NVMe  Error  Information log is not persistent across power cycles or device
              resets.
              If all new errors are either no longer present in the log or are not device related (e.g.  invalid
              command,  invalid  field  in  command, ...), a LOG_INFO message is generated instead.  This avoids
              misleading warnings if the operating system issues unsupported commands and  the  device  firmware
              also logs these kind of errors.

              <u>xerror</u>  -  [ATA]  report  if the number of ATA errors reported in the Extended Comprehensive SMART
              error log has increased since the last check.

              If both '-l error' and '-l xerror' are specified, smartd checks the maximum of both values.

              [Please see the <b>smartctl</b> <b>-l</b> <b>xerror</b> command-line option.]

              <u>xerror</u> - [NVMe] same as '-l error'.

              <u>selftest</u> - report if the number of failed tests reported in the SMART Self-Test Log has  increased
              since  the  last  check,  or  if  the  timestamp  associated  with the most recent failed test has
              increased.  Note that such errors will <b>only</b> be logged if you run self-tests on the  disk  (and  it
              fails  a  test!).   Self-Tests  can  be run automatically by <b>smartd</b>: please see the '-s' Directive
              below.  Self-Tests can also be run manually by using the  '-t  short'  and  <b>'-t</b> <b>long'</b>  options  of
              <b>smartctl</b>  and the results of the testing can be observed using the <b>smartctl</b> <b>'-l</b> <b>selftest'</b> command-
              line option.  [Please see the <b>smartctl</b> <b>-l</b> and <b>-t</b> command-line options.]

              [ATA only] Failed self-tests outdated by a newer successful extended self-test are  ignored.   The
              warning  email  counter  is reset if the number of failed self tests dropped to 0.  This typically
              happens when an extended self-test is run after all bad sectors have been reallocated.

              <u>offlinests[,ns]</u> - [ATA only] report if the Offline Data Collection status has  changed  since  the
              last  check.   The  report  will be logged as LOG_CRIT if the new status indicates an error.  With
              some drives the status often changes, therefore '-l offlinests' is not enabled by '-a'  Directive.
              Appending ',ns' (no standby) to this directive is not implemented on Linux.

              <u>selfteststs[,ns]</u>  - [ATA only] report if the Self-Test execution status has changed since the last
              check.  The report will be logged as LOG_CRIT if the new status  indicates  an  error.   Appending
              ',ns' (no standby) to this directive is not implemented on Linux.

              <u>scterc,READTIME,WRITETIME</u>  -  [ATA  only]  sets  the  SCT  Error  Recovery Control settings to the
              specified values (deciseconds) when <b>smartd</b> starts up and has  no  further  effect.   Values  of  0
              disable   the  feature,  other  values  less  than  65  are  probably  not  supported.   For  RAID
              configurations, this is typically set to 70,70 deciseconds.  [Please see the  <b>smartctl</b>  <b>-l</b>  <b>scterc</b>
              command-line option.]

       <b>-e</b> <b>NAME[,VALUE]</b>
              Sets  non-SMART  device settings when <b>smartd</b> starts up and has no further effect.  [Please see the
              <b>smartctl</b> <b>--set</b> command-line option.]  Valid arguments are:

              <u>aam,[N|off]</u> - [ATA only] Sets the Automatic Acoustic Management (AAM) feature.

              <u>apm,[N|off]</u> - [ATA only] Sets the Advanced Power Management (APM) feature.

              <u>lookahead,[on|off]</u> - [ATA only] Sets the read look-ahead feature.

              <u>security-freeze</u> - [ATA only] Sets ATA Security feature to frozen mode.

              <u>standby,[N|off]</u> - [ATA only] Sets the standby (spindown) timer and places the drive  in  the  IDLE
              mode.

              <u>wcache,[on|off]</u> - [ATA only] Sets the volatile write cache feature.

              <u>dsn,[on|off]</u> - [ATA only] Sets the DSN feature.

       <b>-s</b> <b>REGEXP</b>
              Run  Self-Tests or Offline Immediate Tests, at scheduled times.  A Self- or Offline Immediate Test
              will be run at the end of periodic device polling, if all 12 characters of the string <b>T/MM/DD/d/HH</b>
              match the extended regular expression <b>REGEXP</b>.  Here:

              <b>T</b>   is the type of the test.  The values that <b>smartd</b> will try to match (in turn) are:  'L'  for  a
                  <b>L</b>ong  Self-Test, 'S' for a <b>S</b>hort Self-Test, 'C' for a <b>C</b>onveyance Self-Test (ATA only), and 'O'
                  for an <b>O</b>ffline Immediate Test (ATA only).  As soon as a match  is  found,  the  test  will  be
                  started and no additional matches will be sought for that device and that polling cycle.

                  To run scheduled Selective Self-Tests, use 'n' for <b>n</b>ext span, 'r' to <b>r</b>edo last span, or 'c' to
                  <b>c</b>ontinue  with  next  span  or  redo last span based on status of last test.  The LBA range is
                  based on the first span from the last  test.   See  the  <b>smartctl</b>  <b>-t</b>  <b>select,[next|redo|cont]</b>
                  options for further info.

                  Some  disks  (e.g.  WD)  do  not preserve the selective self test log across power cycles.  If
                  state persistence ('-s' option) is enabled, the last test span is preserved by smartd and used
                  if (and only if) the selective self test log is empty.

              <b>MM</b>  is the month of the year, expressed with two decimal digits.  The range is from  01  (January)
                  to 12 (December) inclusive.  Do <b>not</b> use a single decimal digit or the match will always fail!

              <b>DD</b>  is  the  day  of  the  month,  expressed  with two decimal digits.  The range is from 01 to 31
                  inclusive.  Do <b>not</b> use a single decimal digit or the match will always fail!

              <b>d</b>   is the day of the week, expressed with one decimal digit.  The range is from 1 (Monday)  to  7
                  (Sunday) inclusive.

              <b>HH</b>  is  the  hour  of the day, written with two decimal digits, and given in hours after midnight.
                  The range is 00 (midnight to just before 1 am) to 23 (11pm to just before midnight) inclusive.
                  Do <b>not</b> use a single decimal digit or the match will always fail!

              If the regular expression contains substrings of the form <b>:NNN</b> or <b>:NNN-LLL</b>, where NNN and LLL  are
              three decimal digits, staggered tests are enabled.  Then a test will also be run if all 16 (or 20)
              characters  of the string <b>T/MM/DD/d/HH:NNN</b> (or <b>T/MM/DD/d/HH:NNN-LLL</b>) match the regular expression.
              This check is done for up to seven <b>:NNN</b> or <b>:NNN-LLL</b> found in the  regular  expression.   The  time
              used  for  the  check  is adjusted to the past such that tests of the first drive are not delayed,
              tests of the second drive are delayed by NNN hours, tests of the third drive are delayed by  2*NNN
              hours, and so on.
              If LLL is also specified, delays are limited to LLL hours by calculating each individual delay as:
              '((DRIVE_INDEX * NNN) mod (LLL + 1))'.

              Some  examples  follow.  In reading these, keep in mind that in extended regular expressions a dot
              <b>'.'</b> matches any single character, and a parenthetical expression such as <b>'(A|B|C)'</b> denotes any one
              of the three possibilities <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, or <b>C</b>.

              To run the next test spans on Monday–Friday between 12–13 am, run smartd with this directive:
               <b>-s</b> <b>n/..<a href="file:/../">/../</a>[1-5]/12</b>

              Scheduled  tests  are  run  immediately  following  the regularly-scheduled device polling, if the
              current local date, time, and test type, match <b>REGEXP</b>.  By default the regularly-scheduled  device
              polling  occurs  every  thirty  minutes  after  starting <b>smartd</b>.  Take caution if you use the '-i'
              option to make this polling interval more than sixty minutes: the poll times may fail to  coincide
              with  any of the testing times that you have specified with <b>REGEXP</b>.  In this case the test will be
              run following the next device polling.

              Before running an offline or self-test, <b>smartd</b> checks to be sure that a self-test is  not  already
              running.   If  a self-test <b>is</b> already running, then this running self test will <b>not</b> be interrupted
              to begin another test.

              <b>smartd</b> will not attempt to run <b>any</b> type of test if another test was already started or run in  the
              same hour.

              To  avoid  performance  problems  during system boot, <b>smartd</b> will not attempt to run any scheduled
              tests following the very first device polling (unless '-q onecheck' is specified).

              Each time a test is run, <b>smartd</b> will log an entry to  SYSLOG.   You  can  use  these  or  the  '-q
              showtests'  command-line  option  to  verify  that you constructed <b>REGEXP</b> correctly.  The matching
              order (<b>L</b> before <b>S</b> before <b>C</b> before <b>O</b>) ensures that if multiple test types are all scheduled for the
              same hour, the longer test type has precedence.  This is usually the desired behavior.

              If the scheduled tests are used in conjunction with state persistence ('-s' option),  smartd  will
              also try to match the hours since last shutdown (or 90 days at most).  If any test would have been
              started  during  downtime,  the  longest  (see  above)  of  these tests is run after second device
              polling.

              If the '-n' directive is used and any test would have been started during disk standby  time,  the
              longest of these tests is run when the disk is active again.

              Unix  users:  please beware that the rules for extended regular expressions [<b><a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex</a></b>(7)] are <b>not</b> the
              same as the rules for file-name pattern matching  by  the  shell  [<b><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></b>(7)].   <b>smartd</b>  will  issue
              harmless informational warning messages if it detects characters in <b>REGEXP</b> that appear to indicate
              that you have made this mistake.

       <b>-m</b> <b>ADD</b> Send a warning email to the email address <b>ADD</b> if the '-H', '-l error', '-l xerror', '-l selftest',
              '-f', '-C', '-U', or '-W' Directives detect a failure or a new error, or if a SMART command to the
              disk  fails.   This  Directive  only works in conjunction with these other Directives (or with the
              equivalent default '-a' Directive).

              To prevent your email in-box from getting filled up with  warning  messages,  by  default  only  a
              single  warning  and (depending on '-s' option) daily reminder emails will be sent for each of the
              enabled alert types.  See the '-M' Directive below for details.

              To send email to more than one user, please use the  following  "comma  separated"  form  for  the
              address: <b>user1@add1,user2@add2,...,userN@addN</b> (with no spaces).

              To  test  that  email is being sent correctly, use the '-M test' Directive described below to send
              one test email message on <b>smartd</b> startup.

              By default, email is sent using the system <b><a href="../man1/mail.1.html">mail</a></b>(1)  command.   In  order  that  <b>smartd</b>  find  this
              command  (normally  /usr/bin/mail)  the executable must be in the path of the shell or environment
              from which <b>smartd</b> was started.  If you wish to specify an explicit path  to  the  mail  executable
              (for  example  /usr/local/bin/mail)  or a custom script to run, please use the '-M exec' Directive
              below.

              Note also that there is a special argument <b>&lt;nomailer&gt;</b> which can be given to the '-m' Directive  in
              conjunction with the '-M exec' Directive.  Please see below for an explanation of its effect.

              If  the  mailer  or the shell running it produces any STDERR/STDOUT output, then a snippet of that
              output will be copied to SYSLOG.  The remainder of the  output  is  discarded.   If  problems  are
              encountered  in  sending  mail, this should help you to understand and fix them.  If you have mail
              problems, we recommend running <b>smartd</b> in debug mode with  the  '-d'  flag,  using  the  '-M  test'
              Directive described below.

              If   a   word   of   the   comma   separated   list  has  the  form  '@plugin',  a  custom  script
              /etc/smartmontools/smartd_warning.d/plugin is run and the word is removed  from  the  list  before
              sending  mail.   The  string 'plugin' may be any valid name except 'ALL'.  If '@ALL' is specified,
              all scripts in /etc/smartmontools/smartd_warning.d/* are run instead.   This  is  handled  by  the
              script  /usr/share/smartmontools/smartd_warning.sh  (see  also  '-M  exec' below).  Plugin scripts
              without execute permission are silently ignored.  If any plugin script is missing or fails with  a
              nonzero exit status, the warning script exits immediately without sending mail.

       <b>-M</b> <b>TYPE</b>
              These  Directives  modify  the  behavior  of the <b>smartd</b> email warnings enabled with the '-m' email
              Directive described above.  These '-M' Directives only work in conjunction with the '-m' Directive
              and can not be used without it.

              Multiple -M Directives may be given.  If more than one of the following three  -M  Directives  are
              given (example: -M once -M daily) then the final one (in the example, -M daily) is used.

              The valid arguments to the -M Directive are (one of the following three):

              <u>once</u>  -  send  only one warning email for each type of disk problem detected.  This is the default
              unless state persistence ('-s' option) is enabled.

              <u>always</u> - [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD 7.4 FEATURE] send additional warning reminder emails, upon  each
              check, for each type of disk problem detected.

              <u>daily</u>  -  send  additional  warning  reminder  emails, once per day, for each type of disk problem
              detected.  This is the default if state persistence ('-s' option) is enabled.

              <u>diminishing</u> - send additional warning reminder emails, after a one-day interval,  then  a  two-day
              interval,  then  a  four-day  interval,  and  so  on for each type of disk problem detected.  Each
              interval is twice as long as the previous interval.
              [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD 7.4 FEATURE] The interval length will stay at 32  days  after  5  warning
              reminder emails.

              If  a  disk  problem  is  no longer detected, the internal email counter is reset.  If the problem
              reappears a new warning email is sent immediately.

              In addition, one may add zero or more of the following Directives:

              <u>test</u> - send a single test email immediately upon <b>smartd</b> startup.  This allows one to  verify  that
              email  is  delivered  correctly.   Note  that if this Directive is used, <b>smartd</b> will also send the
              normal email warnings that were enabled with the '-m' Directive, in addition to  the  single  test
              email!

              <u>exec</u> <u>PATH</u> - run the executable PATH instead of the default mail command, when <b>smartd</b> needs to send
              email.  PATH must point to an executable binary file or script.

              By  setting PATH to point to a customized script, you can make <b>smartd</b> perform useful tricks when a
              disk problem is detected (beeping the console, shutting down the machine, broadcasting warnings to
              all logged-in users, etc.)  But please be careful.  <b>smartd</b> will <b>block</b> until  the  executable  PATH
              returns,  so  if  your  executable  hangs,  then  <b>smartd</b>  will also hang.  Some sample scripts are
              included in /usr/share/doc/smartmontools/examples//.

              The exit status of the executable is recorded by <b>smartd</b> in SYSLOG.  The executable is not expected
              to write to STDOUT or STDERR.  If it does, then this is interpreted as indicating  that  something
              is going wrong with your executable, and a fragment of this output is logged to SYSLOG to help you
              to  understand  the  problem.   Normally,  if you wish to leave some record behind, the executable
              should send mail or write to a file or device.

              Before running the executable, <b>smartd</b> sets a number of environment variables.   These  environment
              variables may be used to control the executable's behavior.  The environment variables exported by
              <b>smartd</b> are:

              <b>SMARTD_MAILER</b>
                  is   set   to   the   argument   of   -M  exec,  if  present  or  else  to  'mail'  (examples:
                  /usr/local/bin/mail, mail).

              <b>SMARTD_DEVICE</b>
                  is set to the device path (example: /dev/sda).

              <b>SMARTD_DEVICETYPE</b>
                  is set to the device type specified by '-d' directive or 'auto' if none.

              <b>SMARTD_DEVICESTRING</b>
                  is set to the device description.  It starts with SMARTD_DEVICE and  may  be  followed  by  an
                  optional  controller identification (example: /dev/sda [SAT]).  The string may contain a space
                  and is NOT quoted.

              <b>SMARTD_DEVICEINFO</b>
                  is set to device identify information.  It includes most of the info printed  by  <b>smartctl</b>  <b>-i</b>
                  but  uses  a brief single line format.  This device info is also logged when <b>smartd</b> starts up.
                  The string contains space characters and is NOT quoted.

              <b>SMARTD_FAILTYPE</b>
                  gives the reason for the warning or message email.  The possible  values  that  it  takes  and
                  their meanings are:
                  <u>EmailTest</u>: this is an email test message.
                  <u>Health</u>: the SMART health status indicates imminent failure.
                  <u>Usage</u>: a usage Attribute has failed.
                  <u>SelfTest</u>: the number of self-test failures has increased.
                  <u>ErrorCount</u>: the number of errors in the ATA error log has increased.
                  <u>CurrentPendingSector</u>:  one  of  more  disk  sectors  could  not  be  read and are marked to be
                  reallocated (replaced with spare sectors).
                  <u>OfflineUncorrectableSector</u>: during off-line testing, or self-testing, one or more disk sectors
                  could not be read.
                  <u>Temperature</u>: Temperature reached critical limit (see -W directive).
                  <u>FailedHealthCheck</u>: the SMART health status command failed.
                  <u>FailedReadSmartData</u>: the command to read SMART Attribute data failed.
                  <u>FailedReadSmartErrorLog</u>: the command to read the SMART error log failed.
                  <u>FailedReadSmartSelfTestLog</u>: the command to read the SMART self-test log failed.
                  <u>FailedOpenDevice</u>: the open() command to the device failed.

              <b>SMARTD_ADDRESS</b>
                  is determined by the address argument ADD of the '-m' Directive.  If ADD is  <b>&lt;nomailer&gt;</b>,  then
                  <b>SMARTD_ADDRESS</b>  is  not  set.   Otherwise,  it  is  set  to  the comma-separated-list of email
                  addresses   given   by   the   argument   ADD,   with   the   commas   replaced   by    spaces
                  (example:<a href="mailto:admin@example.com">admin@example.com</a>  root).   If more than one email address is given, then this string
                  will contain space characters and is NOT quoted, so to use it in a shell script you  may  want
                  to enclose it in double quotes.

              <b>SMARTD_ADDRESS_ORIG</b>
                  is set to the original value of <b>SMARTD_ADDRESS</b> with '@plugin' strings still present.  If there
                  are no such strings in the '-m' Directive, this variable is NOT set.

              <b>SMARTD_MESSAGE</b>
                  is  set  to  the  one sentence summary warning email message string from <b>smartd</b>.  This message
                  string contains space characters and is NOT quoted.  So to  use  $SMARTD_MESSAGE  in  a  shell
                  script you should probably enclose it in double quotes.

              <b>SMARTD_FULLMESSAGE</b>
                  is  set  to the contents of the entire email warning message string from <b>smartd</b>.  This message
                  string contains space and return characters and is NOT quoted.  So to use  $SMARTD_FULLMESSAGE
                  in a shell script you should probably enclose it in double quotes.

              <b>SMARTD_TFIRST</b>
                  is  a  text  string  giving  the  time  and  date  at which the first problem of this type was
                  reported.  This text string contains space characters and no newlines, and is NOT quoted.  For
                  example:
                  Sun Feb  9 14:58:19 2003 CST

              <b>SMARTD_TFIRSTEPOCH</b>
                  is an  integer,  which  is  the  unix  epoch  (number  of  seconds  since  Jan  1,  1970)  for
                  <b>SMARTD_TFIRST</b>.

              <b>SMARTD_PREVCNT</b>
                  is an integer specifying the number of previous messages sent.  It is set to '0' for the first
                  message.

              <b>SMARTD_NEXTDAYS</b>
                  is an integer specifying the number of days until the next message will be sent.  It is set to
                  empty on '-M once', set to '0' on '-M always' and set to '1' on '-M daily'.

              If  the '-m ADD' Directive is given with a normal address argument, then the executable pointed to
              by PATH will be run in a shell with STDIN receiving the body of the email message,  and  with  the
              same command-line arguments:
                -s "$SMARTD_SUBJECT" $SMARTD_ADDRESS
              that would normally be provided to 'mail'.  Examples include:
              <b>-m</b> <b>user@home</b> <b>-M</b> <b>exec</b> <b>/usr/bin/mail</b>
              <b>-m</b> <b>admin@work</b> <b>-M</b> <b>exec</b> <b>/usr/local/bin/mailto</b>
              <b>-m</b> <b>root</b> <b>-M</b> <b>exec</b> <b>/Example_1/shell/script/below</b>

              If  the  '-m  ADD'  Directive  is  given  with  the  special  address argument <b>&lt;nomailer&gt;</b> then the
              executable pointed to by PATH is run in a shell with <b>no</b> STDIN and <b>no</b> command-line  arguments,  for
              example:
                -m &lt;nomailer&gt; -M exec /Example_2/shell/script/below

              If  the  executable produces any STDERR/STDOUT output, then <b>smartd</b> assumes that something is going
              wrong, and a snippet of that output will be copied to SYSLOG.  The remainder of the output is then
              discarded.

              Some EXAMPLES of scripts that can be used with the '-M exec'  Directive  are  given  below.   Some
              sample scripts are also included in /usr/share/doc/smartmontools/examples//.

              The  executable  is  run  by  the  script /usr/share/smartmontools/smartd_warning.sh.  This script
              formats subject and full message based on SMARTD_MESSAGE and other environment  variables  set  by
              <b>smartd</b>.   The  environment  variables  SMARTD_SUBJECT and SMARTD_FULLMESSAGE are set by the script
              before running the executable.

       <b>-f</b>     [ATA only] Check for 'failure' of any Usage Attributes.  If these  Attributes  are  less  than  or
              equal  to  the  threshold,  it does NOT indicate imminent disk failure.  It "indicates an advisory
              condition where the usage or age of the device has exceeded  its  intended  design  life  period."
              [Please see the <b>smartctl</b> <b>-A</b> command-line option.]

       <b>-p</b>     [ATA  only]  Report  anytime  that a Prefail Attribute has changed its value since the last check.
              [Please see the <b>smartctl</b> <b>-A</b> command-line option.]

       <b>-u</b>     [ATA only] Report anytime that a Usage Attribute has changed  its  value  since  the  last  check.
              [Please see the <b>smartctl</b> <b>-A</b> command-line option.]

       <b>-t</b>     [ATA  only]  Equivalent to turning on the two previous flags '-p' and '-u'.  Tracks changes in <u>all</u>
              device Attributes (both Prefailure and Usage).  [Please see the <b>smartctl</b> -A command-line option.]

       <b>-i</b> <b>ID</b>  [ATA only] Ignore device Attribute number <b>ID</b> when checking for failure of  Usage  Attributes.   <b>ID</b>
              must be a decimal integer in the range from 1 to 255.  This Directive modifies the behavior of the
              '-f' Directive and has no effect without it.

              This  is  useful, for example, if you have a very old disk and don't want to keep getting messages
              about the hours-on-lifetime Attribute (usually Attribute 9) failing.  This  Directive  may  appear
              multiple times for a single device, if you want to ignore multiple Attributes.

       <b>-I</b> <b>ID</b>  [ATA only] Ignore device Attribute <b>ID</b> when tracking changes in the Attribute values.  <b>ID</b> must be a
              decimal  integer  in  the  range from 1 to 255.  This Directive modifies the behavior of the '-p',
              '-u', and '-t' tracking Directives and has no effect without one of them.

              This is useful, for example, if one of the device Attributes  is  the  disk  temperature  (usually
              Attribute  194  or  231).   It's  annoying to get reports each time the temperature changes.  This
              Directive may appear multiple  times  for  a  single  device,  if  you  want  to  ignore  multiple
              Attributes.

       <b>-r</b> <b>ID[!]</b>
              [ATA  only] When tracking, report the <u>Raw</u> value of Attribute <b>ID</b> along with its (normally reported)
              <u>Normalized</u> value.  <b>ID</b> must be a decimal integer in the  range  from  1  to  255.   This  Directive
              modifies  the  behavior  of the '-p', '-u', and '-t' tracking Directives and has no effect without
              one of them.  This Directive may be given multiple times.

              A common use of this Directive is to track the device Temperature (often ID=194 or 231).

              If the optional flag '!' is appended, a change of the Normalized  value  is  considered  critical.
              The report will be logged as LOG_CRIT and a warning email will be sent if '-m' is specified.

       <b>-R</b> <b>ID[!]</b>
              [ATA only] When tracking, report whenever the <u>Raw</u> value of Attribute <b>ID</b> changes.  (Normally <b>smartd</b>
              only  tracks/reports changes of the <u>Normalized</u> Attribute values.)  <b>ID</b> must be a decimal integer in
              the range from 1 to 255.  This Directive modifies  the  behavior  of  the  '-p',  '-u',  and  '-t'
              tracking  Directives  and has no effect without one of them.  This Directive may be given multiple
              times.

              If this Directive is given, it automatically implies the '-r' Directive for the same Attribute, so
              that the Raw value of the Attribute is reported.

              A common use of this Directive is to track the device Temperature (often ID=194 or  231).   It  is
              also useful for understanding how different types of system behavior affects the values of certain
              Attributes.

              If  the  optional  flag  '!'  is  appended, a change of the Raw value is considered critical.  The
              report will be logged as LOG_CRIT and a warning email will be  sent  if  '-m'  is  specified.   An
              example is '-R 5!' to warn when new sectors are reallocated.

       <b>-C</b> <b>ID[+]</b>
              [ATA  only] Report if the current number of pending sectors is non-zero.  Here <b>ID</b> is the id number
              of the Attribute whose raw value is the Current Pending Sector count.  The allowed range of <b>ID</b>  is
              0  to  255  inclusive.  To turn off this reporting, use ID = 0.  If the <b>-C</b> <b>ID</b> option is not given,
              then it defaults to <b>-C</b> <b>197</b> (since Attribute 197 is generally used to monitor pending sectors).  If
              the name of this Attribute is changed by a '-v 197,FORMAT,NAME' directive, the default is  changed
              to <b>-C</b> <b>0</b>.

              If  '+'  is specified, a report is only printed if the number of sectors has increased between two
              check cycles.  Some disks do not reset this attribute when a bad sector is reallocated.  See  also
              '-v 197,increasing' below.

              The  warning email counter is reset if the number of pending sectors dropped to 0.  This typically
              happens when all pending sectors have been reallocated or could be read again.

              A pending sector is a disk sector (containing 512 bytes of your data) which the device would  like
              to  mark  as  "bad"  and  reallocate.   Typically this is because your computer tried to read that
              sector, and the read failed because the data on it has been corrupted and has  inconsistent  Error
              Checking  and  Correction  (ECC) codes.  This is important to know, because it means that there is
              some unreadable data on the disk.  The problem of figuring out what file this data belongs  to  is
              operating  system  and  file system specific.  You can typically force the sector to reallocate by
              writing to it (translation: make the device substitute a spare good sector for the bad one) but at
              the price of losing the 512 bytes of data stored there.

       <b>-U</b> <b>ID[+]</b>
              [ATA only] Report if the number of offline uncorrectable sectors is non-zero.  Here <b>ID</b> is  the  id
              number  of  the  Attribute whose raw value is the Offline Uncorrectable Sector count.  The allowed
              range of <b>ID</b> is 0 to 255 inclusive.  To turn off this reporting, use ID = 0.  If the <b>-U</b>  <b>ID</b>  option
              is not given, then it defaults to <b>-U</b> <b>198</b> (since Attribute 198 is generally used to monitor offline
              uncorrectable  sectors).   If  the  name  of  this  Attribute is changed by a '-v 198,FORMAT,NAME'
              (except '-v 198,FORMAT,Offline_Scan_UNC_SectCt'), directive, the default is changed to <b>-U</b> <b>0</b>.

              If '+' is specified, a report is only printed if the number of sectors  has  increased  since  the
              last  check  cycle.  Some disks do not reset this attribute when a bad sector is reallocated.  See
              also '-v 198,increasing' below.

              The warning email counter is reset if the number of offline uncorrectable sectors  dropped  to  0.
              This  typically  happens  when all offline uncorrectable sectors have been reallocated or could be
              read again.

              An offline uncorrectable sector is a disk sector which was not readable during an off-line scan or
              a self-test.  This is important to know, because if you have data stored in this disk sector,  and
              you need to read it, the read will fail.  Please see the previous '-C' option for more details.

       <b>-W</b> <b>DIFF[,INFO[,CRIT]]</b>
              Report  if  the  current temperature had changed by at least <b>DIFF</b> degrees since last report, or if
              new min or max temperature is detected.  Report or Warn if the temperature  is  greater  or  equal
              than  one  of <b>INFO</b> or <b>CRIT</b> degrees Celsius.  If the limit <b>CRIT</b> is reached, a message with loglevel
              <b>'LOG_CRIT'</b> will be logged to syslog and a warning email will be send if  '-m'  is  specified.   If
              only the limit <b>INFO</b> is reached, a message with loglevel <b>'LOG_INFO'</b> will be logged.

              The  warning email counter is reset if the temperature dropped below <b>INFO</b> or <b>CRIT</b>-5 if <b>INFO</b> is not
              specified.

              If this directive is used in conjunction with state persistence ('-s' option),  the  min  and  max
              temperature values are preserved across boot cycles.  The minimum temperature value is not updated
              during the first 30 minutes after startup.

              To disable any of the 3 reports, set the corresponding limit to 0.  Trailing zero arguments may be
              omitted.  By default, all temperature reports are disabled ('-W 0').

              To track temperature changes of at least 2 degrees, use:
              <b>-W</b> <b>2</b>
              To log informal messages on temperatures of at least 40 degrees, use:
              <b>-W</b> <b>0,40</b>
              For warning messages/mails on temperatures of at least 45 degrees, use:
              <b>-W</b> <b>0,0,45</b>
              To combine all of the above reports, use:
              <b>-W</b> <b>2,40,45</b>

              For  ATA  devices, smartd interprets Attribute 194 or 190 as Temperature Celsius by default.  This
              can be changed to Attribute 9 or 220 by the drive database or by the '-v 9,temp' or '-v  220,temp'
              directive.

              For NVMe devices, smartd checks the maximum of the Composite Temperature value and all Temperature
              Sensor values reported by SMART/Health Information log.

       <b>-F</b> <b>TYPE</b>
              [ATA  only]  Modifies  the  behavior  of <b>smartd</b> to compensate for some known and understood device
              firmware bug.  This directive may be used multiple times.  The valid arguments are:

              <u>none</u> - Assume that the device firmware obeys the ATA specifications.  This is the default,  unless
              the  device  has  presets  for '-F' in the drive database.  Using this directive will override any
              preset values.

              <u>nologdir</u> - Suppresses read attempts of SMART or GP Log Directory.  Support for all  standard  logs
              is assumed without an actual check.  Some Intel SSDs may freeze if log address 0 is read.

              <u>samsung</u>  -  In  some Samsung disks (example: model SV4012H Firmware Version: RM100-08) some of the
              two- and four-byte quantities in the SMART data structures are byte-swapped (relative to  the  ATA
              specification).   Enabling  this option tells <b>smartd</b> to evaluate these quantities in byte-reversed
              order.  Some signs that your disk needs this option are (1) no self-test log printed, even  though
              you  have  run self-tests; (2) very large numbers of ATA errors reported in the ATA error log; (3)
              strange and impossible values for the ATA error log timestamps.

              <u>samsung2</u> - In some Samsung disks the number of ATA errors reported is byte swapped.  Enabling this
              option tells <b>smartd</b> to evaluate this quantity in byte-reversed order.

              <u>samsung3</u> - Some Samsung disks (at least SP2514N with Firmware VF100-37) report a  self-test  still
              in  progress  with  0%  remaining  when  the  test  was  already  completed.  If this directive is
              specified, <b>smartd</b> will not skip the next scheduled self-test (see Directive '-s'  above)  in  this
              case.

              <u>xerrorlba</u> - This only affects <b>smartctl</b>.

              [Please see the <b>smartctl</b> <b>-F</b> command-line option.]

       <b>-v</b> <b>ID,FORMAT[:BYTEORDER][,NAME]</b>
              [ATA  only]  Sets  a vendor-specific raw value print FORMAT, an optional BYTEORDER and an optional
              NAME for Attribute ID.  This directive may  be  used  multiple  times.   Please  see  <b>smartctl</b>  <b>-v</b>
              command-line option for further details.

              The following arguments affect smartd warning output:

              <u>197,increasing</u>  -  Raw  Attribute  number  197  (Current  Pending  Sector  Count)  is not reset if
              uncorrectable sectors are reallocated.  This  sets  '-C  197+'  if  no  other  '-C'  directive  is
              specified.

              <u>198,increasing</u>  -  Raw  Attribute  number 198 (Offline Uncorrectable Sector Count) is not reset if
              uncorrectable sectors are reallocated.  This  sets  '-U  198+'  if  no  other  '-U'  directive  is
              specified.

       <b>-P</b> <b>TYPE</b>
              [ATA  only]  Specifies  whether  <b>smartd</b>  should use any preset options that are available for this
              drive.  The valid arguments to this Directive are:

              <u>use</u> - use any presets that are available for this drive.  This is the default.

              <u>ignore</u> - do not use any presets for this drive.

              <u>show</u> - show the presets listed for this drive in the database.

              <u>showall</u> - show the presets that are available for all drives and then exit.

              [Please see the <b>smartctl</b> <b>-P</b> command-line option.]

       <b>-a</b>     Equivalent to turning on all of the following Directives: <b>'-H'</b> to check the SMART  health  status,
              <b>'-f'</b>  to  report failures of Usage (rather than Prefail) Attributes, <b>'-t'</b> to track changes in both
              Prefailure and Usage Attributes, <b>'-l</b> <b>error'</b> to report increases  in  the  number  of  ATA  errors,
              <b>'-l</b> <b>selftest'</b>  to  report  increases  in  the  number of Self-Test Log errors, <b>'-l</b> <b>selfteststs'</b> to
              report changes of Self-Test execution status, <b>'-C</b> <b>197'</b> to report nonzero  values  of  the  current
              pending sector count, and <b>'-U</b> <b>198'</b> to report nonzero values of the offline pending sector count.

              Note  that -a is the default for ATA devices.  If none of these other Directives is given, then -a
              is assumed.

       <b>-c</b> <b>OPTION=VALUE</b>
              Allows one to override <b>smartd</b> command line options  for  specific  devices.   Only  the  following
              OPTION is currently supported:

       <b>-c</b> <b>i=N,</b> <b>-c</b> <b>interval=N</b>
              [NEW  EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD 7.3 FEATURE] Sets the interval between disk checks to N seconds, where N
              is a decimal integer.  The minimum allowed value is ten.  The default is the value from the '-i N,
              --interval=N' command line option or its default of 1800 seconds.

       <b>#</b>      Comment: ignore the remainder of the line.

       <b>\</b>      Continuation character: if this is the last non-white or non-comment character on a line, then the
              following line is a continuation of the current one.

       If you are not sure which Directives to use, I suggest experimenting for a few minutes with  <b>smartctl</b>  to
       see  what  SMART functionality your disk(s) support(s).  If you do not like voluminous syslog messages, a
       good choice of <b>smartd</b> configuration file Directives might be:
       <b>-H</b> <b>-l</b> <b>selftest</b> <b>-l</b> <b>error</b> <b>-f</b>.
       If you want more frequent information, use: <b>-a</b>.

       <b>EXAMPLES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>SHELL</b> <b>SCRIPTS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>'-M</b> <b>exec'</b>
              These are two examples of shell scripts that can  be  used  with  the  '-M  exec  PATH'  Directive
              described  previously.  The paths to these scripts and similar executables is the PATH argument to
              the '-M exec PATH' Directive.

              Example 1: This script is for use with '-m ADDRESS -M  exec  PATH'.   It  appends  the  output  of
              <b>smartctl</b> <b>-a</b> to the output of the smartd email warning message and sends it to ADDRESS.

              #! <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>

              # Save the email message (STDIN) to a file:
              cat &gt; /root/msg

              # Append the output of smartctl -a to the message:
              /usr/sbin/smartctl -a -d $SMART_DEVICETYPE \
                $SMARTD_DEVICE &gt;&gt; /root/msg

              # Now email the message to the user at address ADD:
              /usr/bin/mail -s "$SMARTD_SUBJECT" $SMARTD_ADDRESS \
                &lt; /root/msg

              Example  2:  This script is for use with '-m &lt;nomailer&gt; -M exec PATH'.  It warns all users about a
              disk problem, waits 30 seconds, and then powers down the machine.

              #! <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>

              # Warn all users of a problem
              wall &lt;&lt;EOF
              Problem detected with disk: $SMARTD_DEVICESTRING
              Warning message from smartd is: $SMARTD_MESSAGE
              Shutting down machine in 30 seconds...
              EOF

              # Wait half a minute
              sleep 30

              # Power down the machine
              <a href="file:/sbin/shutdown">/sbin/shutdown</a> -hf now

              Some    example    scripts    are    distributed    with    the    smartmontools    package,    in
              /usr/share/doc/smartmontools/examples/.

              Please note that these scripts typically run as root, so any files that they read/write should not
              be  writable  by  ordinary  users or reside in directories like <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> that are writable by ordinary
              users and may expose your system to symlink attacks.

              As previously described, if the scripts  write  to  STDOUT  or  STDERR,  this  is  interpreted  as
              indicating  that  there was an internal error within the script, and a snippet of STDOUT/STDERR is
              logged to SYSLOG.  The remainder is flushed.
