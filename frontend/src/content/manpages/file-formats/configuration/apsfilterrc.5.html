</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       apsfilterrc — configuration file for magic print filter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apsfillterrc</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Apsfilterrc</b> is a configuration file for printers controlled by the <u><a href="../man1/apsfilter.1.html">apsfilter</a></u>(1) magic filter.

       Every apsfilter printer in <u><a href="../man5/printcap.5.html">printcap</a></u>(5) has an <b>apsfilterrc</b> file of its own.

       There  is  one  global apsfilterrc file that controls print characteristics for all printer. The printer-
       specific <b>apsfilterrc</b> files have preference over the global one.

       Reasons for using an <b>apsfilterrc</b> file are if it turns out, that you have  to  type  in  some  commandline
       options  too  often or if an application is unable to parameterize the print command, so that you have to
       hardcode the print characteristic for such dumb applications.

       An enhancement to this concept are user-specific config files, that have preference over the  global  and
       the printer-specific config file. This allows configuration of print characteristics on a per-user basis.

       You should make use of user-specific config files instead of using the deprecated USE_USER_CODE variable,
       which compromises system security and is only an option on a single-user machine, see below.

   <b>Capabilities</b>
       <b>QUALITY</b>          Select print quality (draft, lo|low, med|medium, hi|high, photo).

       <b>SWEEP</b>            Print uni- or bidirectional (uni, bi).

       <b>MEDIA</b>            Select paper type (plain, coated, glossy, premium, trans).

       <b>COLOR</b>            Select color mode (color|colour, gray|grey, mono).

       <b>METHOD</b>           Choose  apsfilters  method  of  data processing (auto, ascii, raw).  Automatic file type
                        recognition and automatic conversion to  Postscript  is  apsfilters  default  processing
                        method.  If  you  want  to print mostly files `as is', you can set the default to 'raw',
                        this disables any kind of file type recognition and conversion. If  you  want  to  print
                        mostly everything as ASCII text, then you can set this option to 'ascii'.

       <b>PAPERSIZE</b>        Set the default paper size (a3, a4, legal, ledger, tabloid).

       <b>ASCII_FILTER</b>     Text file filter to use, when printing ASCII documents (a2ps, mpage, enscript, recode).

       <b>PAPERTRAY</b>        Paper feed tray number (tray0...tray9).

       <b>PRETTY_PRINTING</b>  a2ps highlight level for pretty-printing when using a2ps or enscript as ascii filter (0,
                        1, 2). See also ASCII_FILTER.

       <b>ASCII_HEADER</b>     Whether you want headers in your text prints when using a2ps, mpage or enscript as ascii
                        filter (header, noheader).

       <b>ASCII_BORDER</b>     Whether  you  want  borders  in  your text prints  when using a2ps, mpage or enscript as
                        ascii filter (border, noborder).

       <b>PS_NUP|ASCII_PPS</b>
                        Pages per sheet (1pps, 2pps, 4pps, 8pps).

       <b>LANDSCAPE|ASCII_LANDSCAPE</b>
                        Paper orientation (landscape, portrait).

       <b>PS_BOOK</b>          Output pages in "book"  format,  implies  commandline  options  "2pps,duplex,shortbind".
                        Related options: PS_NUP, ASCII_PPS, DUPLEX, BINDING.

       <b>DUPLEX</b>           Whether to use duplex mode or not (duplex, simplex).

       <b>BINDING</b>          Paper binding edge (shortbind, longbind).

       <b>COPIES</b>           Number of copies (copies=N).

       <b>USE_USER_CODE</b>    Enabling this option is a big potential security hole !!!  If you don't understand this,
                        DO  NOT  USE  IT.   It  makes  user  manageable <b>apsfilterrc</b> files possible which will be
                        sourced (included/executed) during runtime of a printjob under the  permissions  of  the
                        calling  process  (lpd).   This  option is only valid for typical "single-user" systems,
                        where a user wants direct access to an apsfilterrc without having to become root to make
                        changes.  A more conveniant way on a multi-user system, where security is an  issue,  is
                        that   a  system  administrator  creates  user-specific  <b>apsfilterrc</b>  files.  Additional
                        informations can be found in the apsfilter handbook and in the apsfilterrc file together
                        with some examples.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/apsfilter/apsfilterrc</u>
                        apsfilter <u>global</u> config file, settings are overwriteable by more specific printer config
                        files, see below.
       <u>/etc/apsfilter/QUEUE/apsfilterrc</u>
                        apsfilter config file on a <u>per</u> <u>printer</u> <u>queue</u> basis. This file has  preference  over  the
                        global config file.
       <u>/etc/apsfilter/QUEUE/apsfilterrc.USER</u>
                        apsfilter  config  file  on a <u>per</u> <u>user</u> basis (per print queue). This file has preference
                        over the global and the printer queue specific config file.
       <u>$HOME/.apsfilter/apsfilterrc.QUEUE</u>
                        A <u>user</u> <u>defineable</u> config file on a per printer queue basis.  This  file  has  preference
                        over  the global, the printer queue specific and the central per user config file, which
                        is administered by a system administrator.  Enabling this has  a  deep  impact  on  your
                        systems  security, <u>should</u> <u>NOT</u> <u>be</u> <u>used,</u> especially on multi-user systems and is therefore
                        <u>disabled</u> <u>by</u> <u>default.</u> See comments to USE_USER_CODE variable.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       See apsfilter software center - <b><a href="http://www.apsfilter.org/">http://www.apsfilter.org/</a></b> - for new versions, bugfixes and known bugs.

       Please use the new tool <u><a href="../man1/apsfilter-bug.1.html">apsfilter-bug</a></u>(1) to release bug- or problem reports.  It  automatically  presents
       you  a  <b>form</b> in an editor window which asks you some standard questions.  If you save and quit the editor
       session, then this report is sent automatically via <b>e-mail</b> to the proper apsfilter mailinglist.

       If apsfilter fails to print something or prints it in a way you wouldn't expect and you want to report an
       apsfilter error then please save the debugging output of one print  session  using  the  new  <u><a href="../man1/aps2file.1.html">aps2file</a></u>(1)
       utility  by  typing  <b>aps2file</b>  <b>-D</b>  <b>-Z</b>  <b>options</b> <b>file</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>/dev/null</b> <b>2&gt;</b> <b>file.debug</b> and including the debugging
       output in the file <b>file.debug</b> into the edit session of the <b>apsfilter-bug</b> utility, so that it is  included
       into the mail to the apsfilter mailinglist.

       Please  note  that  you need to run <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> (Bourne Shell), bash or a compatible shell, so that the above
       mentioned output redirection works. Under C-shell (/bin/csh) or tcsh it would't work. If you don't  know,
       then  simply  make  sure  you  use  the  Bournce shell by typing <b><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></b> or <b>bash</b>, then you should have no
       problems with redirection of <b>stdout</b> and <b>stderr</b> (&gt; /dev/null 2&gt; file.debug).

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Apsfilter</b> developement started in 1994.

       The <b>apsfilterrc</b> file on a "per printer queue" basis appeared in apsfilter 5.4.0.
