</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       orpierc - is the configuration textfile for the <u><a href="../man1/orpie.1.html">orpie</a></u>(1) console calculator.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       CAUTION:  while  this manpage should be suitable as a quick reference, it may be subject to miscellaneous
       shortcomings in typesetting. The definitive documentation is the user manual provided with Orpie  in  PDF
       format.

       Orpie  reads a run-configuration textfile (generally /etc/orpierc or /usr/local/etc/orpierc) to determine
       key and command bindings. You can create a personalized configuration file in $HOME/.orpierc, and  select
       bindings  that  match  your  usage patterns. The recommended procedure is to ``include'' the orpierc file
       provided with Orpie (see INCLUDING OTHER RCFILES), and add or remove settings as desired.

</pre><h4><b>ORPIERC</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       You may notice that the orpierc syntax is similar to the syntax used in the configuration  file  for  the
       Mutt email client (muttrc).

       Within  the  orpierc  file,  strings  should  be enclosed in double quotes (").  A double quote character
       inside a string may be represented by \" .  The backslash character must be represented  by  doubling  it
       (\\).

   <b>INCLUDING</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>RCFILES</b>
       Syntax: include <u>filename_string</u>
       This syntax can be used to include one run-configuration file within another.  This command could be used
       to load the default orpierc file (probably found in /etc/orpierc) within your personalized rcfile,
        {/.orpierc}. The filename string should be enclosed in quotes.

   <b>SETTING</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>
       Syntax: set <u>variable</u>=<u>value_string</u>
       Several  configuration  variables  can  be  set  using  this  syntax;  check  the CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       description to see a list. The variables are unquoted, but the values should be quoted strings.

   <b>CREATING</b> <b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b>
       Syntax: bind <u>key_identifier</u> <u>operation</u>
       This command will bind a keypress to execute a  calculator  operation.   The  various  operations,  which
       should  not be enclosed in quotes, may be found in the section on CALCULATOR OPERATIONS.  Key identifiers
       may be specified by strings that represent a single keypress, for example "m" (quotes included). The  key
       may be prefixed with "\\C" or "\\M" to represent Control or Meta (Alt) modifiers, respectively; note that
       the  backslash  must  be  doubled. A number of special keys lack single-character representations, so the
       following strings may be used to represent them:

       <b>*</b>      "&lt;esc&gt;"

       <b>*</b>      "&lt;tab&gt;"

       <b>*</b>      "&lt;enter&gt;"

       <b>*</b>      "&lt;return&gt;"

       <b>*</b>      "&lt;insert&gt;"

       <b>*</b>      "&lt;home&gt;"

       <b>*</b>      "&lt;end&gt;"

       <b>*</b>      "&lt;pageup&gt;"

       <b>*</b>      "&lt;pagedown&gt;"

       <b>*</b>      "&lt;space&gt;"

       <b>*</b>      "&lt;left&gt;"

       <b>*</b>      "&lt;right&gt;"

       <b>*</b>      "&lt;up&gt;"

       <b>*</b>      "&lt;down&gt;"

       <b>*</b>      "&lt;f1&gt;" to "&lt;f12&gt;"

       Due to differences between various terminal emulators, this key identifier syntax may not be adequate  to
       describe every keypress. As a workaround, Orpie will also accept key identifiers in octal notation. As an
       example, you could use \024 (do <u>not</u> enclose it in quotes) to represent Ctrl-T.

       Orpie  includes a secondary executable, orpie-curses-keys, that prints out the key identifiers associated
       with keypresses. You may find it useful when customizing orpierc.

       Multiple keys may be bound to the same operation, if desired.

   <b>REMOVING</b> <b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b>
       Syntax:
       unbind_function <u>key_identifier</u>
       unbind_command <u>key_identifier</u>
       unbind_edit <u>key_identifier</u>
       unbind_browse <u>key_identifier</u>
       unbind_abbrev <u>key_identifier</u>
       unbind_variable <u>key_identifier</u>
       unbind_integer <u>key_identifier</u>
       These commands will remove key bindings associated with the various  entry  modes  (functions,  commands,
       editing  operations,  etc.).  The  key  identifiers  should  be defined using the syntax described in the
       previous section.

   <b>CREATING</b> <b>KEY</b> <b>AUTO-BINDINGS</b>
       Syntax: autobind <u>key_identifier</u>
       In order to make repetitive calculations more pleasant, Orpie offers an automatic  key  binding  feature.
       When  a  function or command is executed using its abbreviation, one of the keys selected by the autobind
       syntax will be automatically bound to that operation (unless the operation has already been  bound  to  a
       key).  The  current  set  of autobindings can be viewed in the help panel by executing command_cycle_help
       (bound to 'h' by default).

       The syntax for the key identifiers is provided in the previous section.

   <b>CREATING</b> <b>OPERATION</b> <b>ABBREVIATIONS</b>
       Syntax: abbrev <u>operation_abbreviation</u> <u>operation</u>
       You can use this syntax to set the abbreviations used within Orpie to represent the various functions and
       commands. A list of available operations  may  be  found  in  the  CALCULATOR  OPERATIONS  section.   The
       operation abbreviations should be quoted strings, for example "sin" or "log".

       Orpie  performs autocompletion on these abbreviations, allowing you to type usually just a few letters in
       order to select the desired command. The order of the autocompletion matches will  be  the  same  as  the
       order in which the abbreviations are registered by the rcfile--so you may wish to place the more commonly
       used operation abbreviations earlier in the list.

       Multiple abbreviations may be bound to the same operation, if desired.

   <b>REMOVING</b> <b>OPERATION</b> <b>ABBREVIATIONS</b>
       Syntax: unabbrev <u>operation_abbreviation</u>
       This syntax can be used to remove an operation abbreviation. The operation abbreviations should be quoted
       strings, as described in the previous section.

   <b>CREATING</b> <b>MACROS</b>
       Syntax: macro <u>key_identifier</u> <u>macro_string</u>
       You  can  use this syntax to cause a single keypress (the <u>key_identifier</u>) to be interpreted as the series
       of keypresses listed in <u>macro_string</u>.  The syntax for defining a keypress is the same as that defined  in
       the  section  on  CREATING  KEY  BINDINGS.   The  macro  string  should be a list of whitespace-separated
       keypresses, e.g.  "2 &lt;return&gt; 2 +" (including quotes).

       This macro syntax provides a way to create small programs; by way of example, the  default  orpierc  file
       includes  macros  for  the  base  2  logarithm  and  the  binary  entropy  function  (bound  to  L and H,
       respectively), as well as ``register'' variable shortcuts (&lt;f1&gt; to &lt;f12&gt;).

       Macros may call other macros  recursively.  However,  take  care  that  a  macro  does  not  call  <u>itself</u>
       recursively; Orpie will not trap the infinite loop.

       Note  that  operation  abbreviations  may  be accessed within macros. For example, macro "A" "' a b o u t
       &lt;return&gt;" would bind A to display the ``about Orpie'' screen.

   <b>CREATING</b> <b>UNITS</b>
       Syntax:
       base_unit <u>unit_symbol</u> <u>preferred_prefix</u>
       unit <u>unit_symbol</u> <u>unit_definition</u>
       Units are defined in a two-step process:

       1.     Define a set of orthogonal ``base units.'' All other units must be expressible in terms  of  these
              base  units.  The  base  units can be given a preferred SI prefix, which will be used whenever the
              units are standardized (e.g. via ustand).  The unit symbols and preferred prefixes should  all  be
              quoted strings; to prefer <u>no</u> prefix, use the empty string ("").

       It is expected that most users will use the fundamental SI units for base units.

       2.     Define all other units in terms of either base units or previously-defined units.  Again, the unit
              symbol  and  unit  definition  should  be quoted strings. The definition should take the form of a
              numeric value followed by a units string, e.g.  "2.5_kN*m/s". See the UNITS FORMATTING section for
              more details on the unit string format.

   <b>CREATING</b> <b>CONSTANTS</b>
       Syntax: constant <u>constant_symbol</u> <u>constant_definition</u>
       This syntax can be used to define a physical constant. Both the constant symbol and  definition  must  be
       quoted  strings.  The  constant  definition  should be a numeric constant followed by a units string e.g.
       "1.60217733e-19_C".  All units used in the constant definition must already have been defined.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following configuration variables may be set as described  in  the  SETTING  CONFIGURATION  VARIABLES
       section.

       <b>*</b>      datadir
              This  variable  should be set to the full path of the Orpie data directory, which will contain the
              calculator state save file, temporary buffers, etc.  The default directory is "\<a href="file:~/.orpie/">~/.orpie/</a>".

       <b>*</b>      editor
              This variable may be set to the fullscreen editor of your choice. The default value is "vi". It is
              recommended that you choose an editor that offers horizontal scrolling in place of word  wrapping,
              so  that  the  columns of large matrices can be properly aligned. (The Vim editor could be used in
              this fashion by setting editor to "vim -c 'set nowrap'".)

       <b>*</b>      hide_help
              Set this variable to "true" to hide the left help/status panel, or leave  it  on  the  default  of
              "false" to display the help panel.

       <b>*</b>      conserve_memory
              Set  this  variable  to  "true" to minimize memory usage, or leave it on the default of "false" to
              improve rendering performance. (By default, Orpie caches multiple string  representations  of  all
              stack  elements.  Very  large  integers  in  particular require significant computation for string
              representation, so caching these strings can make display updates much faster.)

</pre><h4><b>CALCULATOR</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Every calculator operation can be made available to the interface  using  the  syntax  described  in  the
       sections on CREATING KEY BINDINGS and CREATING OPERATION ABBREVIATIONS.  The following is a list of every
       available operation.

   <b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       The  following operations are functions--that is, they will consume at least one argument from the stack.
       Orpie will generally abort the computation and provide an informative error message if a function  cannot
       be  successfully  applied  (for  example,  if you try to compute the transpose of something that is not a
       matrix).

       For the exact integer data type, basic arithmetic operations will yield an exact integer result. Division
       of two exact integers will yield the quotient of  the  division.  The  more  complicated  functions  will
       generally promote the integer to a real number, and as such the arithmetic will no longer be exact.

       <b>*</b>      function_10_x
              Raise 10 to the power of the last stack element (inverse of function_log10).

       <b>*</b>      function_abs
              Compute the absolute value of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_acos
              Compute  the  inverse  cosine  of  the  last  stack  element. For real numbers, The result will be
              provided either in degrees or radians, depending on the angle mode of the calculator.

       <b>*</b>      function_acosh
              Compute the inverse hyperbolic cosine of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_add
              Add last two stack elements.

       <b>*</b>      function_arg
              Compute the argument (phase angle of complex number) of the last stack element. The value will  be
              provided in either degrees or radians, depending on the current angle mode of the calculator.

       <b>*</b>      function_asin
              Compute  the inverse sine of the last stack element. For real numbers, The result will be provided
              either in degrees or radians, depending on the angle mode of the calculator.

       <b>*</b>      function_asinh
              Compute the inverse hyperbolic sine of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_atan
              Compute the inverse tangent of the last stack element.  For  real  numbers,  The  result  will  be
              provided either in degrees or radians, depending on the angle mode of the calculator.

       <b>*</b>      function_atanh
              Compute the inverse hyperbolic tangent of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_binomial_coeff
              Compute  the binomial coefficient (``n choose k'') formed by the last two stack elements. If these
              arguments are real, the coefficient is computed using a fast approximation to the log of the gamma
              function, and therefore the result is subject to rounding errors. For exact integer arguments, the
              coefficient is computed using exact arithmetic; this has the potential to be a slow operation.

       <b>*</b>      function_ceiling
              Compute the ceiling of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_convert_units
              Convert stack element 2 to an equivalent expression in the units of element 1. Element 1 should be
              real-valued, and its magnitude will be ignored when computing the conversion.

       <b>*</b>      function_cos
              Compute the cosine of the last stack element. If the argument is real, it will be  assumed  to  be
              either degrees or radians, depending on the angle mode of the calculator.

       <b>*</b>      function_cosh
              Compute the hyperbolic cosine of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_conj
              Compute the complex conjugate of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_div
              Divide element 2 by element 1.

       <b>*</b>      function_erf
              Compute the error function of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_erfc
              Compute the complementary error function of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_eval
              Obtain the contents of the variable in the last stack position.

       <b>*</b>      function_exp
              Evaluate the exponential function of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_factorial
              Compute  the  factorial  of  the last stack element. For a real argument, this is computed using a
              fast approximation to the gamma function, and therefore the result  may  be  subject  to  rounding
              errors  (or  overflow).  For  an  exact  integer  argument,  the factorial is computed using exact
              arithmetic; this has the potential to be a slow operation.

       <b>*</b>      function_floor
              Compute the floor of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_gamma
              Compute the Euler gamma function of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_gcd
              Compute the greatest common divisor of the last two stack elements. This operation may be  applied
              only to integer type data.

       <b>*</b>      function_im
              Compute the imaginary part of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_inv
              Compute the multiplicative inverse of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_lcm
              Compute  the  least  common multiple of the last two stack elements. This operation may be applied
              only to integer type data.

       <b>*</b>      function_ln
              Compute the natural logarithm of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_lngamma
              Compute the natural logarithm of the Euler gamma function of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_log10
              Compute the base-10 logarithm of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_maximum
              Find the maximum values of each of the columns of a real NxM matrix, returning a 1xM matrix  as  a
              result.

       <b>*</b>      function_minimum
              Find  the  minimum values of each of the columns of a real NxM matrix, returning a 1xM matrix as a
              result.

       <b>*</b>      function_mean
              Compute the sample means of each of the columns of a real NxM matrix, returning a 1xM matrix as  a
              result.

       <b>*</b>      function_mod
              Compute element 2 mod element 1. This operation can be applied only to integer type data.

       <b>*</b>      function_mult
              Multiply last two stack elements.

       <b>*</b>      function_neg
              Negate last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_permutation
              Compute  the  permutation  coefficient  determined by the last two stack elements 'n' and 'k': the
              number of ways of obtaining an ordered subset of k elements from a set of n  elements.   If  these
              arguments are real, the coefficient is computed using a fast approximation to the log of the gamma
              function, and therefore the result is subject to rounding errors. For exact integer arguments, the
              coefficient is computed using exact arithmetic; this has the potential to be a slow operation.

       <b>*</b>      function_pow
              Raise element 2 to the power of element 1.

       <b>*</b>      function_purge
              Delete the variable in the last stack position.

       <b>*</b>      function_re
              Compute the real part of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_sin
              Compute  the  sine  of  the  last stack element. If the argument is real, it will be assumed to be
              either degrees or radians, depending on the angle mode of the calculator.

       <b>*</b>      function_sinh
              Compute the hyperbolic sine of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_solve_linear
              Solve a linear system of the form Ax = b, where A and b are the last two elements on the stack.  A
              must  be  a  square  matrix and b must be a matrix with one column. This function does not compute
              inv(A), but obtains the solution by a more efficient LU decomposition method.   This  function  is
              recommended  over  explicitly  computing  the inverse, especially when solving linear systems with
              relatively large dimension or with poorly conditioned matrices.

       <b>*</b>      function_sq
              Square the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_sqrt
              Compute the square root of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_standardize_units
              Convert the last stack element to an equivalent expression using the SI standard base  units  (kg,
              m, s, etc.).

       <b>*</b>      function_stdev_unbiased
              Compute  the  unbiased  sample  standard  deviation  of  each of the columns of a real NxM matrix,
              returning a 1xM matrix as a result. (Compare to HP48's sdev function.)

       <b>*</b>      function_stdev_biased
              Compute the biased (population) sample standard deviation of each of the columns  of  a  real  NxM
              matrix, returning a 1xM matrix as a result. (Compare to HP48's psdev function.)

       <b>*</b>      function_store
              Store element 2 in (variable) element 1.

       <b>*</b>      function_sub
              Subtract element 1 from element 2.

       <b>*</b>      function_sumsq
              Sum the squares of each of the columns of a real NxM matrix, returning a 1xM matrix as a result.

       <b>*</b>      function_tan
              Compute  the  tangent of the last stack element. If the argument is real, it will be assumed to be
              either degrees or radians, depending on the angle mode of the calculator.

       <b>*</b>      function_tanh
              Compute the hyperbolic tangent of the last stack element.

       <b>*</b>      function_to_int
              Convert a real number to an integer type.

       <b>*</b>      function_to_real
              Convert an integer type to a real number.

       <b>*</b>      function_total
              Sum each of the columns of a real NxM matrix, returning a 1xM matrix as a result.

       <b>*</b>      function_trace
              Compute the trace of a square matrix.

       <b>*</b>      function_transpose
