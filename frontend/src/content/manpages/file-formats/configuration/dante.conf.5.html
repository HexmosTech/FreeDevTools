</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dante.conf - socks client configuration file syntax

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration file for the socks client library allow control over logging and server selection.  It
       is divided into two parts; global settings and routes.  A  line  can  be  commented  using  the  standard
       comment character <b>#</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The global settings are in the form of a keyword followed by a colon and the value.

       <b>debug</b>  Setting this field to 1 turns on debugging.

       <b>logoutput</b>
              This  value  controls  where the client library sends logoutput.  It can be either <b>syslog</b>, <b>stdout</b>,
              <b>stderr</b>, a filename, or a combination.  The default is no logging.  Note that the value <b>syslog</b>  may
              conflict with the program being socksified if the program also uses syslog.

       <b>resolveprotocol</b>
              The protocol used to resolve hostnames.  Valid values are <b>udp</b>, <b>tcp</b> and <b>fake</b>.  The default is <b>udp</b>.

       <b>route.badexpire</b>
              How  long  the  "bad"  marking  of a route should remain set before it is removed.  Default is 300
              seconds.

       <b>route.maxfail</b>
              How many times a route can fail before it is marked as bad.  Default is 1.

       <b>timeout.connect</b>
              The number of seconds the client will wait for a connect to the proxy  server  to  complete.   The
              default is 0, indicating the client should use the systems default.

</pre><h4><b>ROUTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  routes  are  specified  with  a  <b>route</b> keyword.  Inside a pair of parenthesis ({}) a set of keywords
       control the behavior of the route.  Each <b>route</b> can contain three address  specifications;  <b>from</b>,  <b>to</b>  and
       <b>via</b>.  A route is selected for a connection based on the values within the <b>route</b> block.

       When  searching for a route to match the clients request, the library will first look for a <b>direct</b> route.
       Then for a <b>socks_v4</b> route, a <b>socks_v5</b> route, a <b>http</b> route, and lastly for a <b>upnp</b> route.

       Depending on  how  the  library  is  configured  and  environment  variables  set  (see  the  manual  for
       <b><a href="../man1/socksify.1.html">socksify</a>(1)</b>), there may or may not be an automatic fallback to an auto-generated <b>direct</b> route if no other
       route is found.

       The <b>route</b> block can contain the following:

       <b>ADDRESSES</b>
              Each  address  field  can consist of a IP-address (and where meaningful, a netmask, separated from
              the IP-address by a '<b>/</b>' sign.), a hostname, a domainname (designated by the leading  '<b>.</b>'),  or  an
              interfacename (where meaningful).  Each address can be followed by a optional <b>port</b> specifier.

       <b>from</b>   The route is used only by requests coming from the address given as value.

       <b>to</b>     The route is used only by requests going to the address given as value.

       <b>via</b>    Address  of  the  proxy server that should be used as a gateway for the connection, or the special
              value <b>direct</b> to indicate the connection should be direct rather than go via any proxy server.

              In the case of <b>upnp</b>, the address can also be the name of the interface to use for discovering  the
              upnp controlpoint, if the full url for the IGD is not yet known, or the special value <b>broadcast</b> to
              indicate the client should broadcast for an upnp-router on all available network interfaces.

       <b>port</b>   Parameter  to  <b>from</b>,  <b>to</b>  and  <b>via</b>.   Accepts  the  keywords <b>eq/=,</b> <b>ne/!=,</b> <b>ge/&gt;=,</b> <b>le/&lt;=,</b> <b>gt/&gt;,</b> <b>lt/&lt;</b>
              followed by a number.  A portrange can also be given as "port &lt;start #&gt; -  &lt;end  #&gt;",  which  will
              match all port numbers within the range &lt;start #&gt; and &lt;end #&gt;.

       <b>Options</b>

       <b>clientcompatibility</b>
              Enables  certain  options for compatibility with broken servers.  Valid values are: <b>necgssapi</b>, for
              compatibility with servers implementing gssapi the NEC socks way.

       <b>command</b>
              The server supports the given commands.  Valid commands are <b>bind</b>, <b>bindreply</b>, <b>connect</b>, <b>udpassociate</b>
              and <b>udpreply</b>.   The default is all commands supported by the protocols set for the route.

              Can be used instead of, or to complement, <b>protocol</b>.

       <b>gssapi.enctype</b>
              Which encryption to enforce for GSSAPI-authenticated communication.  Possible  values  are  <b>clear</b>,
              <b>integrity</b>,  or <b>confidentiality</b>.  The default is to try for confidentially, but accept whatever the
              server offers except <b>clear</b>, as <b>clear</b> is not part of the SOCKS GSSAPI standard.

       <b>gssapi.servicename</b>
              Which servicename to use when involving GSSAPI.  Default is "rcmd".

       <b>method</b> List of authentication methods the <b>client</b> supports and  which  to  offer  the  server.   Currently
              supported values are <b>none</b>, <b>gssapi</b>, and <b>username</b>.  The default is all supported methods.

       <b>protocol</b>
              The  protocols  the  server  supports.   Supported  values  are  <b>tcp</b>  and <b>udp</b>.  The default is all
              supported protocols.

       <b>proxyprotocol</b>
              The proxy protocols the server supports.  Currently supported values are <b>socks_v4</b>, <b>socks_v5</b>, <b>http</b>,
              and <b>upnp</b>.  The default is <b>socks_v4</b> and <b>socks_v5</b>.  Note that if the socks server requires any  form
              of  authentication,  you  need  to  explicitly  set  this  to  to <b>socks_v5</b>, as v4 does not support
              authentication.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       See the example directory in the distribution.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SOCKS_USERNAME</b>
              Use the value of <b>SOCKS_USERNAME</b> as the username when doing username authentication.

       <b>SOCKS_PASSWORD</b>
              Use the value  of  <b>SOCKS_PASSWORD</b>  as  the  password  when  doing  username  authentication.   Not
              recommended as other users on the system might be able to see your password.

       <b>SOCKS_AUTOADD_LANROUTES</b>
              If  this  variable  is  set  to  "no",  the  client will not try to auto-add direct routes for all
              addresses on the LAN.  The default is to add them.

       <b>SOCKS_DISABLE_THREADLOCK</b>
              If this variable is set, the client will not perform threadlocking.  The default is for the client
              to attempt to figure out for itself whether the application to  socksify  needs  threadlocking  or
              not.

       Some additional environment variables are documented in <a href="../man1/socksify.1.html">socksify</a>(1).
