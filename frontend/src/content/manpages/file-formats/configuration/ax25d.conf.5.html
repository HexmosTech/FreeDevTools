       ax25d.conf - ax25d configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Ax25d.conf</b>  controls  the  functioning  of <b>ax25d.</b>  Its purpose is to specify on which ports to listen on,
       which applications are available, and to whom they are available to. The configuration file is common  to
       both AX.25, NET/ROM and Rose and their is similarity between the two parts of the file.

       The general layout for an entry for a given port is as follows:

              interface control
              callsign entry 1
               .
               .
              callsign entry n

       The  <b>interface</b>  <b>control</b>  line  determines  which port and callsigns apply to the following <b>callsign</b> <b>entry</b>
       lines, until the next <b>interface</b> <b>control</b> is read. There are  four  different  variants  of  the  <b>interface</b>
       <b>control</b> line:

              1. [AX.25 Port Name]
              2. [Callsign VIA AX.25 Port Name]
              3. &lt;NET/ROM Port Name&gt;
              4. {Callsign VIA Rose Port Name}

       Version  1  allows  the following <b>callsign</b> <b>entry</b> lines to listen on the AX.25 port specified by the AX.25
       port name using the default callsign of that AX.25 port.

       Version 2 allows the following <b>callsign</b> <b>entry</b> lines to listen on the AX.25 port specified  by  the  AX.25
       port  name using the callsign specified instead of the default callsign of that AX.25 port.  Specifying a
       * for the AX.25 port name allows the following <b>callsign</b> <b>entries</b> to be valid for all the  operating  AX.25
       ports  using  the  callsign  specified. VIA can be abbreviated to just V. If the callsign has an asterisk
       appended to it then the system will be listening on  the  port  with  the  callsign,  but  as  a  pseudo-
       digipeater instead of being the normal destination callsign.

       Version  3  allows  the  following  <b>callsign</b>  <b>entry</b>  lines to listen on the NET/ROM port specified by the
       NET/ROM port name using the default callsign of that NET/ROM port.

       Version 4 allows the following <b>callsign</b> <b>entry</b> lines to listen on the Rose port using the  specified  Rose
       port  name  using  the  callsign  specified as the service access point (SAP). A * may be specified for a
       callsign to allow matching to any incoming Call Requests with any SAP.

       The <b>callsign</b> <b>entry</b> lines have a similar layout for both AX.25, NET/ROM and Rose, the layout is:

              peer window t1 t2 t3 idle n2 mode uid exec args...

       All values must be entered for all entries even when they are not used (ie window for NET/ROM, just enter
       a * instead), The meanings of each of the fields is given below. All timings apart from  the  idle  value
       are given in seconds, the idle values is given in minutes.

              <b>peer</b>      This  specifies  the  callsign  of the remote end of the connection that should have the
                        following parameters and executable set up for them. The syntax of the peer argument  is
                        explained below.

              <b>window</b>    This  sets  the  the  value of the window size, if a value of * is entered in this field
                        then the default value for the port is taken from the “parameters” entry (see below)  or
                        lacking  such  an  entry, the kernel default value is used.  This entry is used by AX.25
                        but not by NET/ROM or Rose.

              <b>t1</b>        This sets the the value of the T1 timer, if a value of * is entered in this  field  then
                        the  default  value  for  the  port  is taken from the “parameters” entry (see below) or
                        lacking such an entry, the kernel default value is used.  This entry  is  used  by  both
                        AX.25 and NET/ROM but not by Rose.

              <b>t2</b>        This  sets  the the value of the T2 timer, if a value of * is entered in this field then
                        the default value for the port is taken from  the  “parameters”  entry  (see  below)  or
                        lacking  such  an  entry,  the kernel default value is used.  This entry is used by both
                        AX.25 and NET/ROM but not by Rose.

              <b>t3</b>        This sets the the value of the T3 timer, if a value of * is entered in this  field  then
                        the  default  value  for  the  port  is taken from the “parameters” entry (see below) or
                        lacking such an entry, the kernel default value is used.  This entry is  used  by  AX.25
                        but not by NET/ROM or Rose.

              <b>idle</b>      This sets the the value of the idle timer, if a value of * is entered in this field then
                        the  default  value  for  the  port  is taken from the “parameters” entry (see below) or
                        lacking such an entry, the kernel default value is used.

              <b>n2</b>        This sets the the value of the N2 counter, if a value of * is entered in this field then
                        the default value for the port is taken from  the  “parameters”  entry  (see  below)  or
                        lacking  such  an  entry,  the kernel default value is used.  This entry is used by both
                        AX.25 and NET/ROM but not by Rose.

              <b>mode</b>      This is a set of flags that control the various properties associated with the  incoming
                        connection.  The  flags  are  single  letters, may be in either upper or lower case, and
                        there may not be any spaces between them. If no flags are to be specified either a 0,  -
                        or a * must be entered instead. The valid mode flag letters are:

                        <b>D</b>    Do not allow connections that have passed via any digipeaters. AX.25 only.

                        <b>L</b>    Do not allow this station to connect, they are Locked out.

                        <b>N</b>    Check that the NET/ROM neighbour is allowed, currently unused.

                        <b>Q</b>    Do not make an entry into the log file for this connection.

                        <b>V</b>    Validate the callsign of the incoming connection, currently unused.

              <b>uid</b>       This is the userid that the following command should run under when executing.

              <b>exec</b>      This  is  the executable that should be executed when an incoming connection matches the
                        criteria of both the <b>interface</b> <b>control</b> and the <b>callsign</b> <b>entry</b> <b>.</b>

              <b>args...</b>   These are the optional arguments that are passed to the executable. All of the arguments
                        are passed literally apart from the following:

                        <b>%d</b>   The name of the port that the connection is on.

                        <b>%U</b>   The username (callsign) of the remote station in upper case without the SSID.

                        <b>%u</b>   The username (callsign) of the remote station in lower case without the SSID.

                        <b>%S</b>   The username (callsign) of the remote station in upper case with the SSID.

                        <b>%s</b>   The username (callsign) of the remote station in lower case with the SSID.

                        <b>%P</b>   The nodename of the remote station in upper case without the SSID.   This  is  only
                             valid under NET/ROM and Rose, under AX.25 a % is substituted instead.

                        <b>%p</b>   The  nodename  of  the remote station in lower case without the SSID.  This is only
                             valid under NET/ROM and Rose, under AX.25 a % is substituted instead.

                        <b>%R</b>   The nodename of the remote station in upper case with the SSID.  This is only valid
                             under NET/ROM and Rose, under AX.25 a % is substituted instead.

                        <b>%r</b>   The nodename of the remote station in lower case with the SSID.  This is only valid
                             under NET/ROM and Rose, under AX.25 a % is substituted instead.

                        <b>%%</b>   A %.

       The <b>peer</b> argument is dependent upon whether AX.25, NET/ROM or Rose is being used. There are five  formats
       of this argument:

              1. default
              2. parameters
              3. callsign
              4. callsign@node
              5. @node

       The first version is used by AX.25, NET/ROM and Rose to specify that all callsigns on a given port are to
       be  matched.  The  default  line  is  usually the last of the <b>callsign</b> <b>entry</b> lines, so that more specific
       entries may have the chance to be matched first.

       The second version is not a <b>callsign</b> <b>entry</b> that is used by any incoming connections. It  is  a  means  to
       specify default values for parameters such as Window, T1, T2, T3, Idle and N2. It is used for both AX.25,
       NET/ROM and Rose.

       The  third  version is used by both AX.25, NET/ROM and Rose to specify the callsign of the remote station
       to match the <b>callsign</b> <b>entry</b> line. If no SSID is specified then the callsign will be matched with any that
       has the same callsign and any SSID. Specifying an SSID causes the callsign to be matched exactly. In  the
       case of NET/ROM and Rose this entry does not specify which node the originating callsign comes from.

       The  fourth  version  is  used  by NET/ROM and Rose to specify the callsign of the remote station and the
       remote node to match the <b>callsign</b> <b>entry</b> line. If no SSID is specified in the callsign  section  then  the
       callsign  will be matched with any that has the same callsign and any SSID. Specifying an SSID causes the
       callsign to be matched exactly.

       The fifth version is used by NET/ROM and Rose to specify only the address of the remote node to match the
       <b>callsign</b> <b>entry</b> line. This entry will mean that all remote users at the given node will match the entry.

       Comments may be embedded in the configuration file by placing a # in the first column.

       ax25d can now honour AX.25 TCP/IP mode-VC connections in a special way.  Therefore, a new  port  specific
       option "parameters_extAX25" is available, with the following options, which are separated by space.

       parameters_extAX25
            VC-debug
            VC-reject-login|VC-wait-login|VC-login-ok
            VC-disc-on-linkfailure-msg, VC-send-failure-msg, VC-log-connections
            Recommended settings in ax25d.conf:
              parameters_extAX25 VC-wait-login VC-disc-on-linkfailure-msg VC-log-connections
            or
              parameters_extAX25 VC-reject-login VC-send-failure-msg VC-log-connections
