</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       motd.news - Message of the day information for feeders or readers

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Two files, found in <u>pathetc</u>, contain local information for news feeders or news readers in a free-form
       format.  The entire files are returned verbatim to any client that issues the LIST MOTD command.  This
       might be used for new information, notification of upcoming downtime, or similar purposes.

       These files are named <u>motd.innd</u> (for news feeders) and <u>motd.nnrpd</u> (for news readers); they are used by
       <b>innd</b> and <b>nnrpd</b>, respectively.

       Make sure that these files are encoded in UTF-8.  They should also be "dot-stuffed", that is to say that
       a line beginning with a dot should have that dot doubled.

       Be aware that use of the LIST MOTD command is not widespread (though documented in RFC 6048) and most
       news clients will never ask for this file.

       If one or both of these files are missing, it is not an error.  The server will just send the client the
       appropriate response for an unmaintained <u>motd.innd</u> or <u>motd.nnrpd</u> file.

       On a fresh INN install, samples for these files are installed in <u>pathetc</u>; you will therefore find in
       <u>motd.innd.sample</u> and <u>motd.nnrpd.sample</u> a few examples of messages that can be communicated to news
       clients.
