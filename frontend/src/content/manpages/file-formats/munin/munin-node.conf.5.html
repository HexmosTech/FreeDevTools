</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       munin-node.conf - Munin-node configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>munin-node.conf</u> is the configuration file for "munin-node", the agent that Munin fetches data from.

       The format is dictated by the use of "Net::Server". A look at "perldoc Net::Server" will give a list of
       options that the file supports by using the module.  This page mainly covers the Munin-specific
       extensions.

       The following options are of special interest:

       <b>allow</b> <b>RE</b>
            IP  based  access  list is implemented through this. The statement may be repeated many times.  It's
            important to note that it's actually a regular expression after the keyword so to allow localhost it
            must be written like this:

                  allow ^127\.0\.0\.1$

       <b>cidr_allow</b> <b>NETWORK/MASK</b>
            An alternative to "allow RE".  This allows the access list to be  specified  in  CIDR  format.   For
            instance,  "cidr_allow  192.0.2.0/24"  would  allow  connections  from  any  IP  from  192.0.2.1  to
            192.0.2.254.

            And "cidr_allow 127.0.0.1/32" is the equivalent to the example above.  Note that the netmask <b>must</b> be
            provided, even though it's just "/32".

            This option requires that the "Net::CIDR" Perl module be installed.

       <b>host</b> <b>IP</b>
            The IP number of the interface munin-node should listen on.  By default munin-node  listens  to  all
            interfaces.   To make munin-node listen only on the localhost interface - making it unavailable from
            the network do this:

                  host 127.0.0.1

   <b>Additional</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>host_name</b> <b>&lt;host&gt;</b>
            If set, overrides the hostname munin-node uses in its  'hello'-negotiation  with  munin.  A  "telnet
            localhost  4949"  will  show  the hostname munin-node is currently using. If munin-node and the main
            munin installation do not agree on the hostname, munin will skip all the plugins of the  machine  in
            question.

       <b>paranoia</b> <b>&lt;yes|no|true|false|on|off|1|0&gt;</b>
            If set, checks permissions of plugin files, and only tries to run files owned by root. Default on.

       <b>ignore_file</b> <b>&lt;regex&gt;</b>
            Files matching &lt;regex&gt; in the node.d/ and node-conf.d/ directories will be overlooked.

       <b>tls</b> &lt;value&gt;
            Can  have  four  values.  "paranoid",  "enabled",  "auto", and "disabled".  "Paranoid" and "enabled"
            require a TLS connection, while "disabled" will not attempt one at all.

            The current default is "disabled" because "auto" is broken.  "Auto" causes bad  interaction  between
            munin-update and munin-node if the node is unprepared to go to TLS.

            If you see data dropouts (gaps in graphs) please try to disable TLS.

       <b>tls_verify_certificate</b> &lt;value&gt;
            This  directive can be "yes" or "no".  It determines if the remote certificate needs to be signed by
            a CA that is known locally.  Default is "no".

       <b>tls_private_key</b> &lt;value&gt;
            This  directive  sets  the  location  of  the  private  key  to  be  used  for  TLS.    Default   is
            /etc/munin/munin-node.pem.  The private key and certificate can be stored in the same file.

       <b>tls_certificate</b> &lt;value&gt;
            This  directive  sets  the  location  of  the  TLS  certificate  to  be  used  for  TLS.  Default is
            /etc/munin/munin-node.pem.  The private key and certificate can be stored in the same file.

       <b>tls_ca_certificate</b> &lt;value&gt;
            This  directive  sets  the  CA  certificate  to  be  used  to  verify  the  node's  certificate,  if
            tls_verify_certificate is set to "yes".  Default is /etc/munin/cacert.pem.

       <b>tls_verify_depth</b> &lt;value&gt;
            This  directive  sets  how  many  signings  up a chain of signatures TLS is willing to go to reach a
            known, trusted CA when verifying a certificate.  Default is 5.

       <b>tls_match</b> &lt;value&gt;
            This directive, if defined, searches a dump of the certificate provided by the remote host  for  the
            given regex.  The dump of the certificate is two lines of the form:

                    Subject Name: /C=c/ST=st/L=l/O=o/OU=ou/CN=cn/emailAddress=email
                    Issuer  Name: /C=c/ST=st/O=o/OU=ou/CN=cn/emailAddress=email

            So, for example, one could match the subject distinguished name by the directive:

                    tls_match Subject Name: /C=c/ST=st/L=l/O=o/OU=ou/CN=cn/emailAddress=email

            Note  that the fields are dumped in the order they appear in the certificate.  It's best to view the
            dump of the certificate by running munin-update in debug mode and reviewing the logs.

            Unfortunately, due to the limited functionality of the SSL module in use,  it  is  not  possible  to
            provide finer-grained filtering.  By default this value is not defined.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       A pretty normal configuration file:

               log_level 4
               log_file /var/log/munin/munin-node.log
               port 4949
               pid_file /var/run/munin-node.pid
               background 1
               setsid 1

               host *
               user root
               group root
               setsid yes

               ignore_file \.bak$
               ignore_file \.rpm(save|new)$
               ignore_file ^README$

               allow ^127\.0\.0\.1$

               ignore_file \.dpkg-(old|new)$
               ignore_file \.rpm(save|new)$
