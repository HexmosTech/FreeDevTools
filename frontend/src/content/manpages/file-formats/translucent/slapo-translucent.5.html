</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       slapo-translucent - Translucent Proxy overlay to slapd

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/ldap/slapd.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Translucent  Proxy  overlay  can  be  used  with a backend database such as <b><a href="../man5/slapd-mdb.5.html">slapd-mdb</a></b>(5) to create a
       "translucent proxy".  Entries retrieved from a remote  LDAP  server  may  have  some  or  all  attributes
       overridden,  or  new  attributes  added,  by  entries in the local database before being presented to the
       client.

       A <b>search</b> operation is first populated with entries from the remote LDAP server, the attributes  of  which
       are  then  overridden with any attributes defined in the local database. Local overrides may be populated
       with the <b>add</b>, <b>modify</b> <b>,</b> and <b>modrdn</b> operations, the use of which is restricted to the root user.

       A <b>compare</b> operation will perform a comparison with attributes defined in the local  database  record  (if
       any) before any comparison is made with data in the remote database.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Translucent Proxy overlay uses a proxied database, typically a (set of) remote LDAP server(s), which
       is configured with the options shown  in  <b><a href="../man5/slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap</a></b>(5),  <b><a href="../man5/slapd-meta.5.html">slapd-meta</a></b>(5)  or  similar.   These  <b>slapd.conf</b>
       options  are specific to the Translucent Proxy overlay; they must appear after the <b>overlay</b> directive that
       instantiates the <b>translucent</b> overlay.

       <b>translucent_strict</b>
              By default, attempts to delete attributes in either the local or remote databases will be silently
              ignored. The <b>translucent_strict</b> directive causes these modifications to  fail  with  a  Constraint
              Violation.

       <b>translucent_no_glue</b>
              This  configuration  option disables the automatic creation of "glue" records for an <b>add</b> or <b>modrdn</b>
              operation, such that all parents of an entry added to the local database must be created by  hand.
              Glue records are always created for a <b>modify</b> operation.

       <b>translucent_local</b> <b>&lt;attr[,attr...]&gt;</b>
              Specify  a  list  of  attributes  that should be searched for in the local database when used in a
              search filter. By default, search filters are only handled  by  the  remote  database.  With  this
              directive, search filters will be split into a local and remote portion, and local attributes will
              be searched locally.

       <b>translucent_remote</b> <b>&lt;attr[,attr...]&gt;</b>
              Specify  a  list  of  attributes that should be searched for in the remote database when used in a
              search filter. This directive complements  the  <b>translucent_local</b>  directive.  Attributes  may  be
              specified as both local and remote if desired.

       If  neither <b>translucent_local</b> nor <b>translucent_remote</b> are specified, the default behavior is to search the
       remote database with the complete search filter. If only <b>translucent_local</b> is  specified,  searches  will
       only  be run on the local database. Likewise, if only <b>translucent_remote</b> is specified, searches will only
       be run on the remote database. In any case, both the local and remote entries corresponding to  a  search
       result will be merged before being returned to the client.

       <b>translucent_bind_local</b>
              Enable  looking for locally stored credentials for simple bind when binding to the remote database
              fails.  Disabled by default.

       <b>translucent_pwmod_local</b>
              Enable RFC 3062 Password Modification extended  operation  on  locally  stored  credentials.   The
              operation only applies to entries that exist in the remote database.  Disabled by default.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       Access  control  is  delegated  to either the remote DSA(s) or to the local database backend for <b>auth</b> and
       <b>write</b> operations.  It is delegated to the remote DSA(s) and to the frontend for <b>read</b>  operations.   Local
       access rules involving data returned by the remote DSA(s) should be designed with care.  In fact, entries
       are  returned  by  the remote DSA(s) only based on the remote fraction of the data, based on the identity
       the operation is performed as.  As a consequence, local rules might only be allowed to see a  portion  of
       the remote data.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The  Translucent  Proxy  overlay  will  disable  schema  checking in the local database, so that an entry
       consisting of overlay attributes need not adhere to the complete schema.

       Because the translucent overlay does not  perform  any  DN  rewrites,   the  local  and  remote  database
       instances  must  have  the  same suffix.  Other configurations will probably fail with No Such Object and
       other errors.
