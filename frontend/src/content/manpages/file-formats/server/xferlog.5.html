       xferlog - ProFTPD server logfile

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>xferlog</b> file contains logging information from the FTP server daemon, <b><a href="../man8/proftpd.8.html">proftpd</a></b>(8).  This file usually
       is found in <b><a href="file:/var/log">/var/log</a></b> but can be located anywhere by using a  <b><a href="../man8/proftpd.8.html">proftpd</a></b>(8)  configuration  directive.   Each
       server  entry  is  composed  of  a  single line of the following form, with all fields being separated by
       spaces.

              <u>current-time</u>    <u>transfer-time</u>    <u>remote-host</u>    <u>file-size</u>    <u>filename</u>    <u>transfer-type</u>    <u>special-</u>
              <u>action-flag</u>     <u>direction</u>     <u>access-mode</u>     <u>username</u>     <u>service-name</u>    <u>authentication-method</u>
              <u>authenticated-user-id</u>  <u>completion-status</u>

       <u>current-time</u>        is the current local time in the form "DDD MMM dd hh:mm:ss YYYY". Where  DDD  is  the
                           day  of the week, MMM is the month, dd is the day of the month, hh is the hour, mm is
                           the minutes, ss is the seconds, and YYYY is the year.

       <u>transfer-time</u>       is the total time in seconds for the transfer.

       <u>remote-host</u>         is the remote host name.

       <u>file-size</u>           is the size of the transferred file in bytes.

       <u>filename</u>            is the name of the transferred file.  If the filename contains any spaces or  control

                                  <b>U</b>         file was uncompressed
                                  <b>T</b>         file was tar'ed
                                  <b>_</b>         no action was taken

       <u>direction</u>           is the direction of the transfer. Can be one of:

       <u>access-mode</u>         is the method by which the user is logged in. Can be one of:
                                  <b>a</b>         (anonymous) is for an anonymous guest user.
                                  <b>r</b>         (real) is for a local authenticated user.

                                  <b>0</b>         none

       <u>authenticated-user-id</u>
                           is the  user  id  returned  by  the  authentication  method.   A  *  is  used  if  an

       <u>completion-status</u>   is a single character indicating the status of the transfer.  Can be one of:
                                  <b>c</b>         complete transfer
