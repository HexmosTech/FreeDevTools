       PtLog - Traces Protection Server operations

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>PtLog</u> file records a trace of Protection Server (<b>ptserver</b> process) operations on the local machine
       and describes any error conditions it encounters.

       If the <u>PtLog</u> file does not already exist in the <u>/var/log/openafs</u> directory when the Protection Server
       starts, the server process creates it and writes initial start-up messages to it.

       The file is in ASCII format. Administrators listed in the <u>/etc/openafs/server/UserList</u> file can use the
       <b>bos</b> <b>getlog</b> command to display its contents. Alternatively, log onto the server machine and use a text
       editor or a file display command such as the UNIX <b>cat</b> command. By default, the mode bits on the <u>PtLog</u>
       file grant the required "r" (read) permission to all users.

       The Protection Server records operations only as it completes them, and cannot recover from failures by
       reviewing the file. The log contents are useful for administrative evaluation of process failures and
       other problems.

       The Protection Server can record messages at several levels of detail. By default, it records only very
       rudimentary messages.  Specify the Protection Server <b>-d</b> &lt;<u>debug</u> <u>level</u>&gt; command line option to set the
       initial logging level when the Protection Server is started.

       To increase the level of detail logged by a running Protection Server, issue the following command while
       logged onto the database server machine as the local superuser "root".

          # kill -TSTP &lt;ptserver_pid&gt;

       where &lt;ptserver_pid&gt; is the process ID of the vlserver process, as reported in the output from the
       standard UNIX <b>ps</b> command. To increase to the second and third levels of detail, repeat the command.

       To disable logging, issue the following command.

          # kill -HUP &lt;ptserver_pid&gt;

       To decrease the level of logging, first completely disable it and then issue the "kill -TSTP" command as
       many times as necessary to reach the desired level.
