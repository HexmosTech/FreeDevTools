</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       esmtprc - <b>esmtp</b> configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A <b>esmtp</b> configuration file consists of several options.  The options format is:

           <u>keyword</u>=<u>value</u>

       The  equal  sign  is  optional and can be replaced by whitespace.  The <u>value</u> may be enclosed in simple or
       double quotes, in which case special characters can be escaped as in normal C strings.

       Comments are delimited by the '#' character up to the newline character.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hostname</b>
              Set SMTP host and service (port).

              The format is:

                  host.example.org[:<u>service</u>]

              With no whitespace surrounding the colon if service is specified.  <u>service</u>  may  be  a  name  from
              <a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a> or a decimal port number.  If not specified the port defaults to 587.

              Note  (from  <b>libESMTP</b> documentation): the default port number is set to 587 since this is the port
              that should be used for mail submission, see RFC 2476.  By choosing this default now, the API does
              not change behavior unexpectedly in the future as use of the  new  standard  becomes  commonplace.
              The  host-port  notation simplifies things for the application, the user can type "localhost:smtp"
              or "localhost:25" where the application expects a host name.

       <b>username</b>
              Set the username for authentication with the SMTP server.

              Do NOT set the username and password in the system configuration file unless you are the only user
              of this machine.  <b>Esmtp</b> is not run with suid privileges therefore the  system  configuration  file
              must  be  readable  by  everyone.  If your SMTP server requires authentication and you are not the
              only user then specify your personal SMTP account details in the user configuration file.

       <b>password</b>
              Set the password for authentication with the SMTP server.

       <b>starttls</b>
              Whether to use the StartTLS extension.

              It can be one of <b>enabled</b>, <b>disabled</b> or <b>required</b>. It defaults to <b>disabled</b>.

       <b>certificate_passphrase</b>
              Set the certificate passphrase for the StartTLS extension.

       <b>helo</b>   Set the hostname to identify as when sending HELO or EHLO  commands.   (This  is  a  per  identity
              option, as it should be the name you are seen as from the connected host, which may vary with host
              to host due to NAT or different naming schemes).

       <b>qualifydomain</b>
              Make all local addresses to remote ones by adding @ and this name.

       <b>force</b> <b>sender</b>
              Set  a  "Sender:" header and ignore those in the message. "%u" will be replaced with the username.
              "%%" by "%".

       <b>force</b> <b>reverse_path</b>
              Set the envelope from address. The address given to -f will only  be  used  as  "From:"  when  the
              message contains none. "%u" will be replaced with the username. "%%" by "%".

       <b>message_id</b>
              Whether  to  set  the  Message-ID field of the message before sending.  Normally the receiving MTA
              sets the Message-ID if missing, so you can turn this off if your sending  host  does  not  have  a
              fully qualified domain name.

              Allowed values are either <b>enabled</b> or <b>disabled</b>. It defaults to <b>enabled</b>

       <b>preconnect</b>
              Shell command to execute prior to opening an SMTP connection.

              This  may  be  useful  in  conjunction with application-level transports (e.g.  <b>ssh</b> with its port-
              forwarding functionality) to secure the SMTP connection. <b>Esmtp</b> will wait for the command  to  exit
              before proceeding.  If the command returns a non-zero status, delivery will be aborted.

       <b>identity</b>
              Define an identity.

              An identity is a set of options associated with a given address.  For example:

                  identity = <a href="mailto:myself@somewhere.com">myself@somewhere.com</a>
                      hostname = smtp.somewhere.com:25
                      username = "myself"
                      password = "secret"

              Identities  are  be  selected  by  the address specified in the <b>-f</b> flag.  You can have as many you
              like.

              The options in the global section (up  to  the  first  <b>identity</b>  option)  constitute  the  default
              identity.  If  no options in the global section are given then the first defined identity is taken
              as the default one.

              Note that the default identity settings are  not  shared  by  the  other  identities.   Everything
              (username, password, etc.) must be specified for every identity even if they don't differ from the
              default identity.

       <b>mda</b>    Set the Mail Delivery Agent (MDA).

              <b>Esmtp</b>  relies upon a MDA for local mail delivery, i.e., addresses without a '@' character.  A non-
              zero error status tells <b>esmtp</b> that delivery failed.

              The local delivery addresses will be inserted into the MDA command wherever you place a  %T.   The
              mail message's <b>From</b> address will be inserted where you place an %F.

              Some common MDAs are "/usr/bin/procmail -d %T", "/usr/bin/deliver" and "/usr/lib/mail.local %T".

       <b>force_mda</b>
              Force mail to be delivered by the MDA.

              When  set, any mail from anywhere to anywhere will instead be delivered to the value of force_mda.
              It will also only be delivered locally, via the mda. This will let you have a  very  minimal  mail
              set-up, which can ONLY handle local mail.

              For example:

                  mda = "procmail -d %T"
                  force_mda = "<u>someuser</u>"
