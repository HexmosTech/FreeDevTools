       bdb.DB0, bdb.DBSYS1 - Contain the Backup Database and associated log

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>bdb.DB0</u> file contains the Backup Database, which records configuration information used by the AFS
       Backup System along with cross-indexed records of the tapes created and volumes dumped using the Backup
       System commands.

       The <u>bdb.DBSYS1</u> file is a log file in which the Backup Server (<b>buserver</b> process) logs each database
       operation before performing it. When an operation is interrupted, the Backup Server replays the log to
       complete the operation.

       Both files are in binary format and reside in the <u>/var/lib/openafs/db</u> directory on each database server
       machine that runs the Backup Server.  When the Backup Server starts or restarts on a given machine, it
       establishes a connection with its peers and verifies that its copy of the <u>bdb.DB0</u> file matches the copy
       on the other database server machines. If not, the Backup Servers use AFS's distributed database
       technology, Ubik, to distribute to all of the machines the copy of the database with the highest version
       number.

       Use the commands in the backup suite to administer the Backup Database. It is advisable to create a
       backup copy of the <u>bdb.DB0</u> file on tape on a regular basis, using the UNIX <b>tar</b> command or another local
       disk backup utility.
