       control.ctl - Specify handling of Usenet control messages

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The file <u>pathetc</u>/control.ctl is used to determine what action is taken when a control message is
       received.  It is read by <b>controlchan</b>, which is normally invoked as a channel program by <b>innd</b>.  When
       <u>control.ctl</u> is modified, <b>controlchan</b> notices this automatically and reloads it.

       If a <u>control.ctl.local</u> file exists in <u>pathetc</u>, it is read by <b>controlchan</b> after <u>control.ctl</u> (the resulting
       behaviour is as though the contents of <u>control.ctl.local</u> were at the end of <u>control.ctl</u>).  This local
       file is formatted like <u>control.ctl</u> and is intended to contain local customization.  It is also
       automatically reloaded when modified.

       Blank lines and lines beginning with a number sign ("#") are ignored.  All other lines should consist of
       four fields separated by colons:

           &lt;type&gt;:&lt;from&gt;:&lt;newsgroups&gt;:&lt;action&gt;

       Lines are matched in order and the last matching line in the file will be used, except for checkgroups
       messages which are handled differently (every matching line is used).

       The first field, &lt;type&gt;, is the type of control message for which this line is valid.  It should either
       be the name of a control message or the word "all" to indicate that it applies to all control messages.
       Besides, the following special types are understood:

       <b>/encoding/</b>
           This  type  specifies  the  encoding  of  newgroup  and  checkgroups  control  messages  so  that new
           descriptions could be decoded the right way.

               /encoding/:*:cn.*:gb18030

           means that a description for a newsgroup in the Chinese cn.*  hierarchy will be decoded as though  it
           were  encoded  in  GB18030, unless a charset is specified in the control message (in such a case, the
           charset mentioned in the message is used).  However, it is possible to override the mentioned charset
           if "=force" is appended after the encoding.  For instance,

               /encoding/:*:scout.forum.chinese:big5=force

           means that the description for scout.forum.chinese will always be decoded as though it  were  encoded
           in Big5, no matter the charset of the corresponding control message.

           The  default  value  when  no  encoding  is  mentioned (or when the specified encoding is unknown) is
           "CP1252".

           The last matching line for a given newsgroup name in <u>control.ctl</u> will be used.

       <b>/localencoding/</b>
           When this type is used, the line consist of only two fields.  The default value when this  type  does
           not appear in <u>control.ctl</u> (or when the specified charset is unknown) is equivalent to:

               /localencoding/:utf-8

           It  means  that new descriptions in the <u>newsgroups</u> file will be written using UTF-8.  And <b>controlchan</b>
           will try to read existing descriptions, so as to see whether they should be updated, as  though  they
           were encoded in UTF-8.

           The last matching line in <u>control.ctl</u> will be used.

       <b>/maxdocheckgroups/</b>
           This  type  specifies  the  maximum number of changes that could be made at one time by a checkgroups
           before bailing and mailing the changes to the admin if no log file was specified.  The default  value
           is "10".

               /maxdocheckgroups/:*:*:10
               /maxdocheckgroups/:*:fr.*:20

           Such  a  configuration  means  that a checkgroups containing 15 changes for the French fr.* hierarchy
           (newgroups to add, remove or change the status) will be automatically honoured whereas a  checkgroups
           containing 15 changes for france.* will only have the required changes mailed or logged.

           The last matching line for a given newsgroup name in <u>control.ctl</u> will be used.

       The  second field, &lt;from&gt;, is a shell-style pattern that matches the e-mail address of the person posting
       the message (with the address first converted to lowercase).  The matching is done with rules  equivalent
       to those of the shell's <u>case</u> statement; see <a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a>(1) for more details.

       If  the control message is a newgroup or rmgroup, the third field, &lt;newsgroups&gt;, is a shell-style pattern
       matching the newsgroup affected by the control message (especially "?" matches exactly one character, "*"
       matches zero or more characters and "|" permits  matching  several  patterns  on  the  same  line  -- for
       instance "comp.*|humanities.*"  matches every newsgroup whose name begins with "comp." or "humanities.").
       If the control message is a checkgroups, the third field is a shell-style pattern matching the newsgroups
       that  should  be processed for checking.  If the control message is of any other type, the third field is
       ignored.

       The fourth field, &lt;action&gt;, specifies what action to take with control messages  that  match  this  line.
       The following actions are understood:

       <b>doit</b>
           The  action  requested  by the control message should be performed.  It means that the change will be
           silently performed.  For checkgroups messages, depending on  the  value  of  <b>/maxdocheckgroups/</b>,  the
           shell  commands  that  should  be  run  may  be  mailed  to  the  news administrator (the argument to
           <b>--with-news-master</b> given at configure time, "usenet" by default) instead of being performed.

           If you always want notification of actions taken, use "doit=mail" instead (see below).

       <b>doit</b>=<u>file</u>
           The action is performed as in <b>doit</b>, and additionally a log entry is written to the specified log file
           <u>file</u>.  If <u>file</u> is the word "mail", the log entry is mailed to the  news  administrator  instead.   An
           empty string is equivalent to <u>/dev/null</u> and says to log nothing.

           If  <u>file</u>  starts  with  a  slash,  it  is  taken  as  the  absolute filename to use for the log file.
           Otherwise, the filename is formed by prepending <u>pathlog</u> and a slash, and appending ".log".  In  other
           words, an action of "doit=newgroup" will log to <u>pathlog</u>/newgroup.log.

       <b>drop</b>
           No  action  is  taken  and  the  message  is  ignored.   For  checkgroups messages, it means that the
           newsgroups mentioned will be considered as  not  existent  in  the  checkgroups  for  its  subsequent
           process.

               checkgroups:*:comp.*:doit
               checkgroups:*:*binaries*:drop

           will for instance remove every newsgroup whose name contains "binaries" in the comp.* hierarchy, even
           though  such  groups are mentioned in the checkgroups.  (In that example, the removal is performed by
           the <b>doit</b> action because <b>drop</b> does nothing by itself.)

       <b>verify-*</b>
           If the action starts with the string "verify-", as in:

               verify-news.announce.newgroups

           then PGP verification of the control message will be  done  and  the  user  ID  of  the  key  of  the
           authenticated  signer will be checked against the expected identity defined by the rest of the string
           ("news.announce.newgroups" in the above example).  This  verification  is  done  via  <b>pgpverify</b>;  see
           <a href="../man1/pgpverify.1.html">pgpverify</a>(1) for more details.

           If  no  logging  is  specified (with =<u>file</u> as mentioned below), logging will be done the same as with
           <b>doit</b> as described above.

       <b>verify-*</b>=<b>mail</b>
           PGP verification is done as for the <b>verify-*</b> action described above, and notification  of  successful
           newgroup  and  rmgroup  control messages and the output of checkgroups messages will be mailed to the
           news administrator.  (In the case of checkgroups messages, this means  that  the  shell  script  that
           should  be run will be mailed to the administrator.  The subject of the mail will contain information
           on whether the script has already been run, depending on the value of <b>/maxdocheckgroups/</b>.)

       <b>verify-*</b>=<u>file</u>
           PGP verification is done as for the <b>verify-*</b> action described above, and a log entry  is  written  to
           the specified file as described in <b>doit</b>=<u>file</u> above.  (In the case of checkgroups messages, this means
           that  the  shell  script output of the checkgroups message will be written to that file.  The initial
           line of the log will contain information on whether the script has already been run, depending on the
           value of <b>/maxdocheckgroups/</b>.)

       <b>log</b> A one-line log message is sent to standard error.  <b>innd</b> normally directs this to <u>pathlog</u>/errlog.

       <b>log</b>=<u>file</u>
           A log entry is written to the specified log file, which is  interpreted  as  in  <b>doit</b>=<u>file</u>  described
           above.

       <b>mail</b>
           A mail message is sent to the news administrator without taking any other action.

       One of the difference between a <b>doit</b> or <b>verify</b> action and a <b>mail</b> action for a checkgroups control message
       lies  in  what  e-mail is sent; <b>doit</b> or <b>verify</b> will mail the news administrator a shell script (which may
       have already been run) to create, delete, or modify newsgroups to match the checkgroups message,  whereas
       <b>mail</b> will just mail relevant lines of the checkgroups for manual processing by the news administrator.

       Use  of  the  <b>verify</b>  action  for  processing  newgroup,  rmgroup  and  checkgroups  messages is STRONGLY
       recommended.  Abuse of control messages is rampant, and authentication via PGP signature is currently the
       only reliable way to be sure that a control message comes from who it claims  to  be  from.   Most  major
       hierarchies are now issuing PGP-authenticated control messages.

       In  order to use <b>verify</b> actions, the PGP key ring of the news user must be populated with the PGP keys of
       the hierarchy maintainers whose  control  messages  you  want  to  honour.   For  more  details  on  PGP-
       authenticated  control  messages  and  the  URL  for  downloading  the PGP keys of major hierarchies, see
       <a href="../man1/pgpverify.1.html">pgpverify</a>(1).

       Control messages of type cancel are handled internally by <b>innd</b> and cannot  be  affected  by  any  of  the
       mechanisms described here.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       With the following three lines in <u>control.ctl</u>:

           newgroup:*:*:drop
           newgroup:<a href="mailto:group-admin@isc.org">group-admin@isc.org</a>:comp.*:verify-news.announce.newgroups
           newgroup:<a href="mailto:kre@munnari.oz.au">kre@munnari.oz.au</a>:aus.*:mail

       a  newgroup  coming  from  "<a href="mailto:group-admin@isc.org">group-admin@isc.org</a>"  will be honoured if it is for a newsgroup in the comp.*
       hierarchy  and  if  it  has  a  valid  signature  corresponding  to  the  PGP  key  with  a  user  ID  of
       "news.announce.newgroups".   If  any  newgroup claiming to be from "<a href="mailto:kre@munnari.oz.au">kre@munnari.oz.au</a>" for a newsgroup in
       the aus.* hierarchy is received, it too will be honoured.  All other newgroup messages will be ignored.

       Besides, if a <u>control.ctl.local</u> file exists and contains:

           newgroup:*:comp.lang.*:drop

       then a newgroup control article for comp.lang.awk  will  not  be  honoured  even  though  it  comes  from
       "<a href="mailto:group-admin@isc.org">group-admin@isc.org</a>" with a valid signature.

       As  for  checkgroups,  suppose  your  news  server  contains  these  groups  for foo.*, all of them being
       unmoderated ("y" status in the <u>active</u> file):

           foo.bar1
           foo.bar2.first
           foo.bar2.second
           foo.bar2.third
           foo.bar3
           foo.bar3.first
           foo.bar3.second
           foo.bar5

       and you receive the following checkgroups by &lt;<a href="mailto:foo@bar.com">foo@bar.com</a>&gt; for foo.*:

           foo.bar1          A valid newsgroup.
           foo.bar3.first    Only one newsgroup in foo.bar3.*.
           foo.bar4          A newsgroup you want.
           foo.bar5          A newsgroup you do not want.
           foo.bar5.first    Another newsgroup you do not want.

       with the following <u>control.ctl</u> entries:

           /maxdocheckgroups/:*:foo.*:2

           checkgroups:<a href="mailto:foo@bar.com">foo@bar.com</a>:foo.*:verify-key-foo
           checkgroups:<a href="mailto:foo@bar.com">foo@bar.com</a>:foo.bar2.*:doit
           checkgroups:<a href="mailto:foo@bar.com">foo@bar.com</a>:foo.bar3.*:mail
           checkgroups:<a href="mailto:foo@bar.com">foo@bar.com</a>:foo.bar4|foo.bar4.*:doit
           checkgroups:<a href="mailto:foo@bar.com">foo@bar.com</a>:foo.bar5|foo.bar5.*:drop

       Then, as <u>control.ctl</u> is processed from bottom, here is what happens:

       1.  The newsgroups foo.bar5 and foo.bar5.first are marked as unwanted.  But nothing is  done  yet:  other
           <u>control.ctl</u>  entries  have  to  be  processed  with  a real action and a set of newsgroups containing
           foo.bar5 and foo.bar5.first.

       2.  The newsgroup foo.bar4 is silently created on the news server, with the description "A newsgroup  you
           want."  added  to  the <u>newsgroups</u> file.  In the absence of encoding values (either in the checkgroups
           message or in <b>/encoding/</b> and <b>/localencoding</b>), the default is to decode the sentence as CP1242 and re-
           encode it as UTF-8.

           If "doit=mail" was used, a mail would be sent to the news administrator to inform him  that  foo.bar4
           was successfully created.

       3.  The  newsgroup foo.bar3.second is no longer present.  A mail is sent to the news administrator with a
           shell script to execute.  When it is manually executed, foo.bar3.second will be removed.

           Note that the descriptions are handled differently and have already been updated without  any  manual
           intervention  (foo.bar3.first  now  has  the  description  "Only  one  newsgroup  in foo.bar3.*." and
           foo.bar3.second no longer has a description).

       4.  The newsgroups foo.bar2.first, foo.bar2.second and foo.bar2.third are no longer present.  However, as
           the maximum number of changes that could be made at one time by  a  checkgroups  before  bailing  and
           mailing the changes to the news administrator is 2, these newsgroups are not removed.  A mail is sent
           with a shell script to manually execute in order to remove these groups from the news server.

           Note  that  their  descriptions  are  removed from the <u>newsgroups</u> file, as well as any other possible
           descriptions for obsolete newsgroups in foo.bar2.*.

       5.  The remaining entry is executed if the PGP verification of the  checkgroups  message  is  successful.
           Otherwise, nothing is done (especially, foo.bar5 remains on the news server).

           In  case the PGP signature is verified, foo.bar3 and foo.bar5 are removed from the news server.  This
           entry acts upon newsgroups marked as dropped in its scope and newsgroups not already  dealt  with  by
           previous <u>control.ctl</u> entries (like foo.bar3 because only foo.bar3.* was previously checked).

           Note  that  if  you  had  wanted  to  keep  foo.bar3  or  foo.bar5,  you could have added them to the
           <u>localgroups</u> file in <u>pathetc</u>.
