</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       deb-control - Debian binary package control file format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DEBIAN/control</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Each Debian binary package contains a <b>control</b> file in its <b>control</b> member, and its <b><a href="../man5/deb822.5.html">deb822</a></b>(5) format is a
       subset of the <b>debian/control</b> template source control file in Debian source packages, see
       <b><a href="../man5/deb-src-control.5.html">deb-src-control</a></b>(5).

       This file contains a number of fields.  Each field begins with a tag, such as <b>Package</b> or <b>Version</b> (case
       insensitive), followed by a colon, and the body of the field (case sensitive unless stated otherwise).
       Fields are delimited only by field tags.  In other words, field text may be multiple lines in length, but
       the installation tools will generally join lines when processing the body of the field (except in the
       case of the <b>Description</b> field, see below).

</pre><h4><b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Package:</b> <u>package-name</u> (required)
           The  value  of  this  field  determines  the package name, and is used to generate file names by most
           installation tools.

       <b>Package-Type:</b> <b>deb</b>|<b>udeb</b>|<u>type</u>
           This field defines the type of the package.  <b>udeb</b> is for size-constrained packages used by the debian
           installer.  <b>deb</b> is the default value, it is assumed if the field is  absent.   More  types  might  be
           added in the future.

       <b>Version:</b> <u>version-string</u> (required)
           Typically,  this is the original package's version number in whatever form the program's author uses.
           It may also include a Debian revision number (for non-native packages).  The exact format and sorting
           algorithm are described in <b><a href="../man7/deb-version.7.html">deb-version</a></b>(7).

       <b>Maintainer:</b> <u>fullname-email</u> (recommended)
           Should be in the format “Joe Bloggs &lt;<a href="mailto:jbloggs@foo.com">jbloggs@foo.com</a>&gt;”, and is typically the person who  created  the
           package, as opposed to the author of the software that was packaged.

       <b>Description:</b> <u>short-description</u> (recommended)
        <u>long-description</u>
           The  format  for  the  package  description  is  a  short  brief summary on the first line (after the
           <b>Description</b> field).  The following lines should be used as a longer, more detailed description.  Each
           line of the long description must be preceded by a space, and blank lines  in  the  long  description
           must contain a single ‘<b>.</b>’ following the preceding space.

       <b>Section:</b> <u>section</u>
           This  is  a  general  field that gives the package a category based on the software that it installs.
           Some common sections are <b>utils</b>, <b>net</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>text</b>, <b>x11</b>, etc.

           The accepted values are based on the specific distribution policy.

       <b>Priority:</b> <u>priority</u>
           Sets the importance of this package in relation to the system as a whole.  The known  priorities  are
           <b>required</b>, <b>important</b>, <b>standard</b>, <b>optional</b>, <b>extra</b>, and <b>unknown</b>, but other values can be used as well.

           How to apply these values depends on the specific distribution policy.

       <b>Installed-Size:</b> <u>size</u>
           The  approximate total size of the package's installed files, in KiB units.  The algorithm to compute
           the size is described in <b><a href="../man5/deb-substvars.5.html">deb-substvars</a></b>(5).

       <b>Protected:</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>no</b>
           This field is usually only needed when the answer is <b>yes</b>.  It denotes  a  package  that  is  required
           mostly  for  proper  booting of the system or used for custom system-local meta-packages.  <b><a href="../man1/dpkg.1.html">dpkg</a></b>(1) or
           any other installation tool will not allow a <b>Protected</b> package to be removed (at  least  not  without
           using one of the force options).

           Supported since dpkg 1.20.1.

       <b>Essential:</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>no</b>
           This  field is usually only needed when the answer is <b>yes</b>.  It denotes a package that is required for
           the packaging system, for proper operation of the system in general  or  during  boot  (although  the
           latter  should be converted to <b>Protected</b> field instead).  <b><a href="../man1/dpkg.1.html">dpkg</a></b>(1) or any other installation tool will
           not allow an <b>Essential</b> package to be removed (at least not without using one of the force options).

       <b>Build-Essential:</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>no</b>
           This field is usually only needed when the answer is <b>yes</b>, and is commonly  injected  by  the  archive
           software.  It denotes a package that is required when building other packages.

       <b>Architecture:</b> <u>arch</u>|<b>all</b> (required)
           The   architecture  specifies  which  type  of  hardware  this  package  was  compiled  for.   Common
           architectures are <b>amd64</b>, <b>armel</b>, <b>i386</b>, <b>powerpc</b>, etc.  Note that the <b>all</b> value is  meant  for  packages
           that  are  architecture  independent.   Some  examples  of  this  are  shell  and  Perl  scripts, and
           documentation.

       <b>Origin:</b> <u>name</u>
           The name of the distribution this package is originating from.

       <b>Bugs:</b> <u>url</u>
           The <u>url</u> of the bug tracking system for this package.  The  current  used  format  is  <u>bts-type</u><b>://</b><u>bts-</u>
           <u>address</u>, like <b>debbugs://bugs.debian.org</b>.

       <b>Homepage:</b> <u>url</u>
           The upstream project home page <u>url</u>.

       <b>Tag:</b> <u>tag-list</u>
           List of tags describing the qualities of the package.  The description and list of supported tags can
           be found in the <b>debtags</b> package.

       <b>Multi-Arch:</b> <b>no</b>|<b>same</b>|<b>foreign</b>|<b>allowed</b>
           This field is used to indicate how this package should behave on a multi-arch installations.

           <b>no</b>  This  value  is  the  default  when  the field is omitted, in which case adding the field with an
               explicit <b>no</b> value is generally not needed.

           <b>same</b>
               This package is co-installable with itself, but it must not be used to satisfy the dependency  of
               any package of a different architecture from itself.

           <b>foreign</b>
               This  package  is  not  co-installable  with itself, but should be allowed to satisfy a non-arch-
               qualified dependency of a package of a different  arch  from  itself  (if  a  dependency  has  an
               explicit arch-qualifier then the value <b>foreign</b> is ignored).

           <b>allowed</b>
               This allows reverse-dependencies to indicate in their <b>Depends</b> field that they accept this package
               from  a  foreign  architecture  by  qualifying  the  package  name  with  <b>:any</b>, but has no effect
               otherwise.

       <b>Source:</b> <u>source-name</u> [<b>(</b><u>source-version</u><b>)</b>]
           The name of the source package that this binary package came from, if it is different than  the  name
           of  the  package itself.  If the source version differs from the binary version, then the <u>source-name</u>
           will be followed by a <u>source-version</u> in parenthesis.  This can happen for example  on  a  binary-only
           non-maintainer upload, or when setting a different binary version via «<b>dpkg-gencontrol</b> <b>-v</b>».

       <b>Subarchitecture:</b> <u>value</u>
       <b>Kernel-Version:</b> <u>value</u>
       <b>Installer-Menu-Item:</b> <u>value</u>
           These  fields  are  used  by the debian-installer and are usually not needed.  For more details about
           them,                                                                                             see
           &lt;https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debian-installer/-/raw/master/doc/devel/modules.txt&gt;.

       <b>Depends:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           List of packages that are required for this package to provide a non-trivial amount of functionality.
           The  package  maintenance software will not allow a package to be installed if the packages listed in
           its <b>Depends</b> field  aren't  installed  (at  least  not  without  using  the  force  options).   In  an
           installation,  the  postinst scripts of packages listed in <b>Depends</b> fields are run before those of the
           packages which depend on them.  On the opposite, in a removal, the prerm script of a package  is  run
           before those of the packages listed in its <b>Depends</b> field.

       <b>Pre-Depends:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           List  of  packages  that  must be installed <b>and</b> configured before this one can be installed.  This is
           usually used in the case where this package requires another package for running its preinst script.

       <b>Recommends:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           Lists packages that would be found together with this one in  all  but  unusual  installations.   The
           package maintenance software will warn the user if they install a package without those listed in its
           <b>Recommends</b> field.

       <b>Suggests:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           Lists packages that are related to this one and can perhaps enhance its usefulness, but without which
           installing this package is perfectly reasonable.

       The  syntax  of  <b>Depends</b>,  <b>Pre-Depends</b>, <b>Recommends</b> and <b>Suggests</b> fields is a list of groups of alternative
       packages.  Each group is a list of packages separated by vertical bar  (or  “pipe”)  symbols,  ‘<b>|</b>’.   The
       groups  are  separated  by commas.  Commas are to be read as “AND”, and pipes as “OR”, with pipes binding
       more tightly.  Each package name is optionally followed by an architecture  qualifier  appended  after  a
       colon ‘<b>:</b>’, optionally followed by a version number specification in parentheses.

       An  architecture  qualifier name can be a real Debian architecture name (since dpkg 1.16.5) or <b>any</b> (since
       dpkg 1.16.2).  If omitted, the default is  the  current  binary  package  architecture.   A  real  Debian
       architecture  name  will  match  exactly  that  architecture  for  that  package name, <b>any</b> will match any
       architecture for that package name if the package has been marked as <b>Multi-Arch:</b> <b>allowed</b>.

       A version number may start with a ‘<b>&gt;&gt;</b>’, in which case any later version will match, and  may  specify  or
       omit  the Debian packaging revision (separated by a hyphen).  Accepted version relationships are ‘<b>&gt;&gt;</b>’ for
       greater than, ‘<b>&lt;&lt;</b>’ for less than, ‘<b>&gt;=</b>’ for greater than or equal to, ‘<b>&lt;=</b>’ for less than or equal to,  and
       ‘<b>=</b>’ for equal to.

       <b>Breaks:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           Lists  packages  that  this  one breaks, for example by exposing bugs when the named packages rely on
           this one.  The package maintenance  software  will  not  allow  broken  packages  to  be  configured;
           generally the resolution is to upgrade the packages named in a <b>Breaks</b> field.

       <b>Conflicts:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           Lists packages that conflict with this one, for example by containing files with the same names.  The
           package  maintenance  software  will not allow conflicting packages to be installed at the same time.
           Two conflicting packages should each include a <b>Conflicts</b> line mentioning the other.

       <b>Replaces:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           List of packages files from which this one replaces.  This is  used  for  allowing  this  package  to
           overwrite  the files of another package and is usually used with the <b>Conflicts</b> field to force removal
           of the other package, if this one also has the same files as the conflicted package.

       The syntax of <b>Breaks</b>, <b>Conflicts</b> and <b>Replaces</b> is a  list  of  package  names,  separated  by  commas  (and
       optional whitespace).  In the <b>Breaks</b> and <b>Conflicts</b> fields, the comma should be read as “OR”.  An optional
       architecture  qualifier  can  also be appended to the package name with the same syntax as above, but the
       default is <b>any</b> instead of the binary package architecture.  An optional version can also  be  given  with
       the same syntax as above for the <b>Breaks</b>, <b>Conflicts</b> and <b>Replaces</b> fields.

       <b>Enhances:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           This  is  a  list  of packages that this one enhances.  It is similar to <b>Suggests</b> but in the opposite
           direction.

       <b>Provides:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           This is a list of virtual packages that this one provides.  Usually this  is  used  in  the  case  of
           several  packages all providing the same service.  For example, sendmail and exim can serve as a mail
           server, so they provide a common package (“mail-transport-agent”) on which other packages can depend.
           This will allow sendmail or exim to serve as a valid option to satisfy the dependency.  This prevents
           the packages that depend on a mail server from having to know the package names for all of them,  and
           using ‘<b>|</b>’ to separate the list.

       The  syntax  of  <b>Provides</b>  is a list of package names, separated by commas (and optional whitespace).  An
       optional architecture qualifier can also be appended to the package name with the same syntax  as  above.
       If omitted, the default is the current binary package architecture.  An optional exact (equal to) version
       can also be given with the same syntax as above (honored since dpkg 1.17.11).

       <b>Built-Using:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           This  dependency  field  lists  extra  source packages that were used during the build of this binary
           package, for license compliance purposes.  This is an indication to the archive maintenance  software
           that  these  extra source packages must be kept whilst this binary package is maintained.  This field
           must be a comma-separated list of source package names with strict ‘<b>=</b>’ version relationships enclosed
           within parenthesis.  Note that the archive maintenance software is likely  to  refuse  to  accept  an
           upload which declares a <b>Built-Using</b> relationship which cannot be satisfied within the archive.

       <b>Static-Built-Using:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           This  dependency  field  lists  extra  source packages that were used during the build of this binary
           package, for static building purposes (for example  linking  against  static  libraries,  builds  for
           source-centered  languages  such  as Go or Rust, usage of header-only C/C++ libraries, injecting data
           blobs into code, etc.).  This is useful to track whether this package might need to be  rebuilt  when
           source  packages listed here have been updated, for example due to security updates.  This field must
           be a comma-separated list of source package names with  strict  ‘<b>=</b>’  version  relationships  enclosed
           within parenthesis.

           Supported since dpkg 1.21.3.

       <b>Built-For-Profiles:</b> <u>profile-list</u> (obsolete)
           This  field  used  to specify a whitespace separated list of build profiles that this binary packages
           was built with (since dpkg 1.17.2 until 1.18.18).  The information previously found in this field can
           now be found in the <b>.buildinfo</b> file, which supersedes it.

       <b>Auto-Built-Package:</b> <u>reason-list</u>
           This field specifies a whitespace separated list of reasons  why  this  package  was  auto-generated.
           Binary  packages marked with this field will not appear in the <u>debian/control</u> template source control
           file.  The only currently used reason is <b>debug-symbols</b>.

       <b>Build-Ids:</b> <u>elf-build-id-list</u>
           This field specifies a whitespace separated list of ELF build-ids.  These are unique identifiers  for
           semantically identical ELF objects, for each of these within the package.

           The format or the way to compute each build-id is not defined by design.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
        Package: grep
        Essential: yes
        Priority: required
        Section: base
        Maintainer: Wichert Akkerman &lt;<a href="mailto:wakkerma@debian.org">wakkerma@debian.org</a>&gt;
        Architecture: sparc
        Version: 2.4-1
        Pre-Depends: libc6 (&gt;= 2.0.105)
        Provides: rgrep
        Conflicts: rgrep
        Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep.
         The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
         GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
         twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
         search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
         considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
         look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
         than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
         will run more slowly, however).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>Build-Ids</b>  field  uses a rather generic name out of its original context within an ELF object, which
       serves a very specific purpose and executable format.
