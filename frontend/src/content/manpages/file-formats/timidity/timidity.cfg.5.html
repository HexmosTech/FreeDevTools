</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       timidity.cfg - configure file of TiMidity++

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The file <b>timidity.cfg</b> describes the runtime environments of <a href="../man1/timidity.1.html">timidity</a>(1): that are the path of sound font,
       instruments configurations, etc.
       <b>TiMidity++</b>  looks  for the configuration file <b>timidity.cfg</b> at startup, before processing any options.  If
       it can't be accessed, and the library path is changed with a <b>-L</b> option on  the  command  line,  then  the
       default file will be sought again along the new library path after processing all options, unless another
       configuration file was specified with the <b>-c</b> option.
       Configuration  files  define  the  mapping  of  MIDI programs to instrument files.  Multiple files may be
       specified, and statements in later ones will override earlier ones.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLE</b></h4><pre>
       When alphanumeric and/or underscore `_' characters continue after dollar sign `$', it is considered  that
       the  string  is  a  variable and the configuration file is processed, it is transposed to another string.
       The variable name can also be written with an inside parenthesis, in order to separate from  a  following
       character.

       For example:
       $variable
       ${variable} # same as $variable

       For  the  moment,  the  command which newly defines variables is not prepared.  The undefined variable is
       transposed to null string.
       The variable defined as a regular variable is the next only one.

       <b>$basedir</b>
              Expresses the directory where  the  configuration  file  exists.   By  the  command  which  mainly
              specifies a path, it uses in order to specify the relative path from a setting file.
              When a blank may be included in $basedir, it is necessary to bundle with "".

              For example:
              In /usr/local/share/timidity/timidity.cfg
              dir $basedir/inst # source /usr/local/share/timidity/inst

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The following statements can be used in a configuration file:

       <b>dir</b> <u>directory</u> <u>[...]</u>
              Adds <u>directory</u> to the search path in the same manner as the <b>-L</b> command line option.
              Archive file are also allowed.

              For example:
              dir /usr/local/share/timidity/inst/foo.zip#
              bank 0
              0 bar.pat
              1 baz.pat
              2 zoo.pat

              At  first,  <b>dir</b>  specifies  the archive name (followed by `#') for the path of patch files same as
              directory name (in this case, /usr/local/share/timidity/inst/foo.zip).  <b>TiMidity++</b>  recognize  the
              path  is  an  archive  file  if the expression has the last character `#', and also read the files
              contained in this archive file.  In previous example the patch files bar.pat, baz.pat and  zoo.pat
              contained in the foo.zip are also installed.

       <b>source</b> <u>file</u> <u>[...]</u>
              Reads another configuration file, then continues processing the current one.

       <b>progbase</b> <u>number</u>
              Sets  and  displays  the tone number from <u>number</u> to <u>number</u>+128.  If <b>progbase</b> <b>1</b> are specified, tone
              numbers that follow are set and displayed as the numbers from <b>1</b> to <b>128</b>.

       <b>bank</b> <u>[MapID1]</u> <u>number</u>
              Selects the tone bank to modify.  Patch mappings that follow will affect this tone bank.  You  can
              indicate  specific map as a target, by specifying any of the following to <u>MapID1</u>: <b>gm2</b>, <b>sc55</b>, <b>sc88</b>,
              <b>sc88pro</b>, <b>sc8850</b>, <b>xg</b> and <b>xgsfx64</b>.

       <b>drumset</b> <u>[MapID2]</u> <u>number</u>
              Selects the drum set to modify.  Patch mappings that follow will affect this drum  set.   You  can
              indicate  specific  map  as  a  target,  by  specifying  any  of the following to <u>MapID2</u>: <b>gm2drum</b>,
              <b>sc55drum</b>, <b>sc88drum</b>, <b>sc88prodrum</b>, <b>sc8850drum</b>, <b>xgdrum</b> and <b>xgsfx126</b>.

       <b>number</b> <u>file</u> <u>[options]</u>
       <b>number</b> <b>%font</b> <u>file</u> <u>bank</u> <u>prog</u> <u>[key]</u> <u>[options]</u>
       <b>number</b> <b>%sample</b> <u>file</u> <u>[options]</u>
              Specifies that the MIDI program number in the current tone bank or drum set should be played using
              the patch file.  If <u>file</u> is SoundFont, the specific instrument with <u>bank</u>, <u>prog</u>, and <u>key</u>  is  taken
              out  by  the  format of <b>number</b> <b>%font</b>.  If <u>file</u> is linear AIFF or WAV sample data, the MIDI program
              number is specified by the format of <b>number</b> <b>%sample</b>.  Options may be any of the following:

              <b>amp=</b><u>amplification</u>
                     Amplifies the instrument's volume by <u>amplification</u> percent.  If no value is specified,  one
                     will be automatically determined whenever the instrument is loaded.

              <b>note=</b><u>note</u>
                     Specifies  a  fixed  MIDI  note  to  use  when  playing  the instrument.  If <u>note</u> is <b>0</b>, the
                     instrument will be played at whatever note the  Note  On  event  triggering  it  has.   For
                     percussion  instruments, if no value is specified in the configuration file, the default in
                     the patch file will be used.

              <b>pan=</b><u>panning</u>
                     Sets the instrument's default panning.  <u>panning</u> may be <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>center</b>, or  an  integer
                     between  <b>-100</b>  and  <b>100</b>, designating full left and full right respectively.  If no value is
                     specified, the default in the patch file will be used.  Note that panning controls in  MIDI
                     files will override this value.

              <b>tune=</b><u>tuning[,...]</u>
                     Adjust  the  instrument's  root  frequency.   <b>tune=1</b>  causes  <b>1</b>  half tone higher.  Since a
                     fraction is available for <u>tuning</u>, it is possible to do fine tuning such as <b>tune=-0.2</b>.  When
                     two or more sample data is contained, the arguments after the second can specify  different
                     value respectively.

              <b>rate=</b><u>attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]</u>
                     Sets the instrument's ADSR rate.  Each value may be an integer between <b>0</b> and <b>255</b>.  When you
                     set only sustain rate,

                     6 GUS/hrpschrd.pat rate=::60

                     is available.  When you set only attack time fasten,

                     6 GUS/hrpschrd.pat rate=255

                     is  available.   When  two or more sample data is contained, the arguments after the second
                     can specify different value respectively.

              <b>offset=</b><u>attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]</u>
                     Sets the instrument's ADSR offset.  Each value may be an integer between <b>0</b>  and  <b>255</b>.   The
                     format is same as <b>rate=</b>.

              <b>keep={loop|env}</b>
                     By  default,  percussion  instruments  have  their  loop and envelope information stripped.
                     Strangely shaped envelopes are removed automatically  from  melodic  instruments  as  well.
                     <b>keep=</b>  can  be used to prevent stripping loop or envelope data.  For example, the Short and
                     Long Whistle percussion  instruments  (General  Midi  numbers  71  and  72)  need  to  have
                     `<b>keep=loop</b> <b>keep=env</b>' specified in the configuration file.

              <b>strip={loop|env|tail}</b>
                     Force  removal of loop or envelope information from all patches in the instrument, or strip
                     the tail, i.e. all data after the loop.  Some third-party instruments  have  garbage  after
                     the loop, as evidenced by a clicking noise whenever the instrument is played, so adding the
                     <b>strip=tail</b> option will markedly improve sound quality.

              <b>tremolo=</b><u>sweep_increment:control_ratio:depth[,...]</u>
                     Sets the instrument's tremolo.  Each value may be an integer between <b>0</b> and <b>255</b>.  The format
                     is  similar to <b>rate=</b>.  <u>sweep_increment</u> is the time until tremolo is started.  <u>control_ratio</u>
                     is the rate changing amplification.  <u>depth</u> is the depth changing amplification.

              <b>vibrato=</b><u>sweep_increment:phase_increment:depth[,...]</u>
                     Sets the instrument's vibrato.  Each value may be an integer between <b>0</b> and <b>255</b>.  The format
                     is  similar  to  <b>rate=</b>.   <u>sweep_increment</u>  is  the   time   until   vibrato   is   started.
                     <u>phase_increment</u> is the rate changing frequency.  <u>depth</u> is the depth changing frequency.

              <b>sclnote=</b><u>note[,...]</u>
                     Sets  the  instrument's standard note for scale tuning.  For example, <b>sclnote=60</b> causes the
                     center note C to be standard note for scale tuning.   When  two  or  more  sample  data  is
                     contained, the arguments after the second can specify different value respectively.

              <b>scltune=</b><u>tune[,...]</u>
                     Sets  the  instrument's  scale  tuning factor in cents.  For example, <b>scltune=50</b> causes the
                     half tone steps as <b>50</b> cents.  When two or more sample  data  is  contained,  the  arguments
                     after the second can specify different value respectively.

              <b>comm=</b><u>comment</u>
                     Specifies the comment <u>comment</u>.

              <b>modrate=</b><u>attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]</u>
              <b>modoffset=</b><u>attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]</u>
                     Sets the instrument's behavior of change of modulation envelope.  The format and values are
                     fundamentally  same  as  volume envelope.  Except for some SoundFonts, even if it specifies
                     only the option, nothing happens.

              <b>envkeyf=</b><u>attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]</u>
                     Sets the instrument's volume envelope key follow.  Based on <b>note=60</b>,  it  changes  envelope
                     time  according  to note.  The unit is +-cent/key.  For example, <b>envkeyf=100</b> means that the
                     attack time will double when it goes up by 1 octave.  The format is similar to <b>rate=</b>.   The
                     parameter of <u>decay</u> and <u>sustain</u> may be preset in some SoundFont.

              <b>envvelf=</b><u>attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]</u>
                     Sets  the  instrument's  volume envelope velocity follow.  Based on <b>velocity=64</b>, it changes
                     envelope  time  according  to  velocity.   The  unit  is  +-cent/velocity.   For   example,
                     <b>envvelf=100</b>  means  that  the  attack  time  will  38 times at <b>velocity=127</b>.  The format is
                     similar to <b>rate=</b>.  In the future, the specification of this option may be changed.

              <b>modkeyf=</b><u>attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]</u>
                     Sets the instrument's modulation  envelope  key  follow.   Based  on  <b>note=60</b>,  it  changes
                     envelope  time  according to note.  The unit is +-cent/key.  For example, <b>modkeyf=100</b> means
                     that the attack time will double when it goes up by 1 octave.  The  format  is  similar  to
                     <b>rate=</b>.  The parameter of <u>decay</u> and <u>sustain</u> may be preset in some SoundFont.

              <b>modvelf=</b><u>attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]</u>
                     Sets  the  instrument's  modulation  envelope  velocity  follow.   Based on <b>velocity=64</b>, it
                     changes envelope time according to velocity.  The unit is  +-cent/velocity.   For  example,
                     <b>modvelf=100</b>  means  that  the  attack  time  will  38 times at <b>velocity=127</b>.  The format is
                     similar to <b>rate=</b>.  In the future, the specification of this option may be changed.

              <b>trempitch=</b><u>num[,...]</u>
                     Sets the instrument's depth of changing pitch according to tremolo.  The effect  itself  is
                     same  as vibrato, it uses to operate in another system.  The unit is +-cent.  The format is
                     similar to <b>rate=</b>.

              <b>tremfc=</b><u>num[,...]</u>
                     Sets the instrument's depth of changing cutoff frequency  according  to  tremolo.   It  can
                     express the so-called glowl effect.  The unit, etc.  are same as <b>trempitch=</b>.

              <b>modpitch=</b><u>num[,...]</u>
                     Sets  the  instrument's  depth  of changing pitch according to modulation envelope.  It can
                     temporarily express raising pitch only for the attack stage.  The unit, etc.  are  same  as
                     <b>trempitch=</b>.

              <b>modfc=</b><u>num[,...]</u>
                     Sets  the instrument's depth of changing cutoff frequency according to modulation envelope.
                     The unit, etc. are same as <b>trempitch=</b>.

              <b>fc=</b><u>num[,...]</u>
                     Sets the instrument's standard of cutoff frequency.  The unit is Hz.  The format is similar
                     to <b>rate=</b>.

              <b>q=</b><u>num[,...]</u>
                     Sets the instrument's Q (resonance).  The unit is cB.  The format is similar to <b>rate=</b>.

              <b>fckeyf=</b><u>num</u>
                     Sets the instrument's filter key follow.  Based on  <b>note=60</b>,  it  change  cutoff  frequency
                     according  to note.  The unit is +-cent/key.  For example, <b>fckeyf=100</b> means that it changes
                     same as pitch.

              <b>fcvelf=</b><u>num</u>
                     Sets the instrument's filter velocity follow.  Based on  <b>velocity=127</b>,  it  changes  cutoff
                     frequency  according  to velocity.  The unit is +-cent.  In SoundFont, <b>-2400</b> is set up as a
                     characteristic value.

              <b>qvelf=</b><u>num</u>
                     Sets the instrument's resonance velocity follow.  Based on <b>velocity=0</b>, it changes resonance
                     according to velocity.  The unit is +-cB.

       <b>default</b> <u>file</u>
              When MIDI program appears, which is not mapped to instrument file, this file is  pronounced  as  a
              substitute.

       <b>map</b> <u>MapID1</u> <u>from-bank</u> <u>from-prog</u> <u>to-bank</u> <u>to-prog</u>
              The  existing  tone is assigned as a tone of GS/XG each map.  <b>gm2</b>, <b>sc55</b>, <b>sc88</b>, <b>sc88pro</b>, <b>sc8850,</b> <b>xg</b>
              and <b>xgsfx64</b> can be specified to be <u>MapID1</u>.

              <b>order=</b><u>number</u>
                     Sets  the  order of searching for instrument.  When <b>order=0</b>, first read SoundFont, and then
                     search for insufficient samples in  GUS/patch.   When  <b>order=1</b>,  after  reading  GUS/patch,
                     search for SoundFont.

              <b>amp=</b><u>amplification</u>
                     Sets  the  amplification  of  the  whole  SoundFont as <u>amplification</u>%.  If the value is not
                     specified, it is set by <b>100</b>%.

              <b>cutoff=</b><u>number</u>
                     Specifies whether LPF in SoundFont is enable (<b>1</b>) or disable  (<b>0</b>).   If  the  value  is  not

              to be <b>0</b> and <b>127</b> respectively.

              For example:
              drumset 0
              #extension playnote -37,39,44-46,55-60

       <b>#extension</b> <b>delaysend</b> <u>progno</u> <u>level</u>
       <b>#extension</b> <b>chorussend</b> <u>progno</u> <u>level</u>
       <b>#extension</b> <b>reverbsend</b> <u>progno</u> <u>level</u>
              Sets the send level when drum part effect is enable.  All initial value are <b>127</b>.  If one of delay,
              chorus  and  reverb  is  at  least set up, the effect which is not set as the tone will become the
              initial value <b>0</b>.  <u>progno</u> can carry out package specification  by  `,'  and/or  [<u>start</u>]-[<u>end</u>].   If
              start and end are omitted, they are assumed to be <b>0</b> and <b>127</b> respectively.

       <b>#extension</b> <b>rnddelay</b> <u>progno</u> <u>msec</u>
              For  every pronunciation, it is random and less than a maximum of <u>msec</u> delay.  The distribution of
              random value is pink noise (1/f fluctuation) rather than a white noise.

       These <b>#extension</b> statements are beginning with character `#' that is the comment  flag  of  old  TiMidity
       (version 0.2i or earlier).  So these statements are treated as comment line.
       The latest <b>TiMidity++</b> treats <b>#extension</b> as white-space.  So you can omit it.

       If  any  file-name  expression ended with character `|' (Ascii 0x7c), the file-name is treated as command
       and outputs of the command are also examined as arguments of statements.
       <b>source</b> <u>command</u>| causes the output of <u>command</u> becomes the argument of <b>source</b>.  It is convenient to  choose
       settings  of <b>TiMidity++</b> according to environment.  In addition, if a space enters on the way like <u>command</u>
       |, it will be divided at the time of setting file reading, and will no longer be regarded as  a  command.
       This function is applicable to all the places that can specify a file name.

              timidity 'cat fild.mid|'

       will read from the output of cat fild.mid.
