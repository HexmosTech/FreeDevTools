</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pam_afs_session - AFS PAG and token PAM module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         auth          optional        pam_afs_session.so
         session       required        pam_afs_session.so

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The AFS session service module for PAM, typically installed at <u>/lib/security/pam_afs_session.so</u>,
       establishes new AFS sessions and obtains AFS tokens when a new session is opened for a user.  It is a
       shared object that is dynamically loaded by the PAM subsystem as necessary, based on the system PAM
       configuration.  PAM is a system for plugging in external authentication and session management modules so
       that each application doesn't have to know the best way to check user authentication or create a user
       session on that system.  For details on how to configure PAM on your system, see the PAM man page, often
       <u><a href="../man7/pam.7.html">pam</a></u>(7).

       This module provides pam_setcred, pam_open_session, and pam_close_session implementations for AFS.
       Because pam_setcred is part of the auth PAM group, it also implements a dummy pam_authenticate that
       always succeeds (otherwise, it can't provide a pam_setcred).

       Make sure that this module is NEVER listed as "sufficient" or as the only "required" module in the auth
       group.  Doing so will potentially allow users to log on without any password.  There unfortunately isn't
       a way to work around this and still provide pam_setcred without running afoul of a bug in (at least)
       Linux PAM 0.99.7.1 and probably earlier that causes authentication to fail when the final module in the
       auth group returns PAM_IGNORE and "[default=done]" was given as the action.

       Here are the actions of this module:

       pam_open_session
           When  a  new  session is opened, this module will first check to see if AFS is running on the system.
           If not, it will log a message and exit successfully.  If AFS is running, it  will  place  the  user's
           session  in  a new PAG (Process Authentication Group, often implemented as supplemental groups, which
           limits user tokens to only processes in that PAG).  It will then attempt  to  obtain  tokens,  either
           directly  if  built  with  the Heimdal libkafs library and Kerberos support or by running an external
           <b>aklog</b> program.  If PAG creation fails, the module will fail; if obtaining tokens  fails,  the  module
           will log a warning but still return success.

           The  module  will  only attempt to obtain tokens if the environment variable KRB5CCNAME is set in the
           environment, unless otherwise configured (see the always_aklog option).  It will always create a  new
           PAG, however.

       pam_close_session
           If  and  only  if  pam_open_session  successfully obtained AFS tokens and AFS is still running on the
           system, pam_close_session will delete the tokens in the current PAG (equivalent  to  running  <b>unlog</b>).
           To leave the tokens after session close, set the retain_after_close option.

       pam_setcred
           When   pam_setcred  is  called  with  the  PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED  flag,  it  will  do  the  same  as  if
           pam_open_session was called.  When pam_setcred is called with the PAM_DELETE_CRED flag,  it  will  do
           the  same as if pam_close_session was called.  When called with the PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED flag or the
           PAM_REFRESH_CRED flag, it won't create a new PAG but instead will only  attempt  to  get  new  tokens
           (still skipping this unless KRB5CCNAME is set in the environment or always_aklog is set).

       This  module  is primarily intended for use with a Kerberos authentication module.  It does not itself do
       any user authentication; it cannot, for instance, be used to authenticate users to a <b>kaserver</b>.  While  it
       is  intended for use with an <b>aklog</b> that uses Kerberos ticket caches to obtain tokens, it can be used with
       any <b>aklog</b> implementation (always_aklog may have to be set if no Kerberos ticket cache will be present).

       This module performs no authorization checks and does not hook into password changes; it only  implements
       the session functions and pam_setcred.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  AFS  session  PAM  module  supports the following configuration options, which may be set in the PAM
       configuration as arguments listed after "pam_afs_session.so" or in the system <u>krb5.conf</u>.

       Some of them take arguments, in which case the argument will be given after "=".  The  rest  are  boolean
       options.   To  set  a  boolean  option  in the PAM configuration, just give the name of the option in the
       arguments.  To set an option that takes an argument, follow the option name with an equal sign ("=")  and
       the  value,  with  no  separating whitespace.  Whitespace in option arguments is not supported in the PAM
       configuration files of most PAM implementations.

       To set an option for the PAM module in the system <u>krb5.conf</u> file, put that option  in  the  [appdefaults]
       section.   The  AFS session PAM module will look for options either at the top level of the [appdefaults]
       section or in a subsection  named  "pam-afs-session"  (currently,  realm-specific  configuration  is  not
       checked).   For  example,  the following fragment of a <u>krb5.conf</u> file would set <u>aklog_homedir</u> to true and
       <u>minimum_uid</u> to 100.

           [appdefaults]
               aklog_homedir = true
               pam-afs-session = {
                   minimum_uid = 100
               }

       There is no difference to the PAM module whether  options  are  specified  at  the  top  level  or  in  a
       "pam-afs-session"  section;  the  "pam-afs-session"  section  is supported in case there are options that
       should be set for the PAM module but not for other applications.  For more information on the  syntax  of
       <u>krb5.conf</u>, see <u><a href="../man5/krb5.conf.5.html">krb5.conf</a></u>(5).

       If  the  same option is set in <u>krb5.conf</u> and in the PAM configuration, the latter takes precedent.  Note,
       however, that due to the configuration syntax, there's no way to turn off a boolean  option  in  the  PAM
       configuration that was turned on in <u>krb5.conf</u>.

       afs_cells=<u>cell</u>[,<u>cell</u>...]
           Obtain  tokens  for  the  listed  cells  instead of the default local cell.  If more than one cell is
           listed, try to obtain tokens for each cell.  If specified in <u>krb5.conf</u>, the cells can be separated by
           any combination of spaces and commas; if specified in the PAM configuration, they must  be  separated
           by commas.

           If the AFS session PAM module is running an external program, this option is implemented by passing a
           <b>-c</b> flag with the cell as its argument for each listed cell to that program.  If aklog_homedir is also
           set, the <b>-c</b> flags and the <b>-p</b> flag will all be passed to the external program.

       aklog_homedir
           Try  to  obtain  the  necessary  tokens  to  access the user's home directory.  If the libkafs token-
           obtaining API is used, setting this will cause the AFS session PAM module to  pass  the  user's  home
           directory  into that API and request that the appropriate tokens be obtained.  If running an external
           <b>aklog</b> program, <b>aklog</b> will be called with <b>-p</b> <u>home-directory</u> where <u>home-directory</u> is the home directory
           of the local user for which the session is being opened or refreshed.  This generally will tell <b>aklog</b>
           to check that path, find all AFS cells involved in access to that path, and attempt to obtain  tokens
           for  each  one.  Note that this means that if the user's home directory is not in AFS, no tokens will
           be obtained.

           In either case, the user's home directory is obtained via <u>getpwnam()</u> based on the username  PAM  says
           we are authenticating.

       always_aklog
           Normally,  the  AFS  session  PAM  module only tries to obtain tokens if KRB5CCNAME is set in the PAM
           environment.  If this option is set, it will always attempt to obtain tokens.  This is only useful if
           it is configured to run an external <b>aklog</b> program.

           This can be used if your environment doesn't correctly set KRB5CCNAME in  the  environment  for  some
           reason,  or  if  your <b>aklog</b> doesn't rely on a Kerberos ticket cache to obtain tokens (or can find the
           cache on its own via some other means).

       debug
           If this option is set, additional trace information will be logged to syslog with priority LOG_DEBUG.

       ignore_root
           If this option is set, the AFS session PAM module won't take any action (and will exit  successfully)
           if the account for which the session is being established is named "root".

       kdestroy
           If  this  option  is  set  and the AFS session PAM module was built with Kerberos support, the user's
           ticket cache will be destroyed after tokens are obtained successfully.  If tokens  are  not  obtained
           successfully, the ticket cache will be left intact.  Please note that this is not properly a security
           feature,  since  the  ticket  cache  will  still be written to disk between the time the Kerberos PAM
           module authenticates the user and the time the AFS session PAM module is run.  It  can,  however,  be
           used to reduce the window during which Kerberos ticket caches are lying about if the only use one has
           for ticket caches is to obtain AFS tokens.

       minimum_uid=<u>uid</u>
           If  this option is set, the AFS session PAM module won't take any action (and will exit successfully)
           if the account for which the session is being established has a UID lower than <u>uid</u>.

       nopag
           If this option is set, no PAG will be created.  Be careful when using this  option,  since  it  means
           that  the  user  will  inherit  a PAG from the process managing the login.  If <b>sshd</b>, for instance, is
           started in a PAG, every user who logs in via ssh will be put in the same PAG and will share tokens if
           this option is used.

           This is the default on Mac OS X, where PAGs are not supported.

       notokens
           If this option is set, the AFS session PAM module will only create a PAG and not  attempt  to  obtain
           tokens.   Setting  this  option  overrides  all other settings related to acquiring tokens, including
           always_aklog.  If both nopag and notokens are set, the module essentially does nothing.

           Setting notokens also implies retain_after_close, meaning that the AFS session PAM module  will  also
           not attempt to delete tokens when the user's session ends.

       program=<u>path</u>
           The path to the <b>aklog</b> program to run.  Setting this option tells the AFS session PAM module to always
           run  an  external program to obtain tokens and never use the libkafs interface, even if the latter is
           available.

           You may pass options to this program by separating them with commas (or spaces or tabs  in  <u>krb5.conf</u>
           or if the configuration syntax of your PAM configuration allows this).  For example, the setting:

               program=/usr/bin/aklog,-noprdb,-524

           will  run  "/usr/bin/aklog  -noprdb  -524" as the program to obtain tokens.  The arguments are passed
           directly, not parsed by the shell.

           If this option is not set, the default behavior is to call the libkafs function to obtain tokens,  if
           available,  and  otherwise to use a default path to <b>aklog</b> determined at compile time (the first <b>aklog</b>
           found on the compiler's path by default).  If no <b>aklog</b> could be found at  compile  time  and  libkafs
           isn't used, this option must be set.

       retain_after_close
           If  this option is set, pam_close_session will do nothing (successfully) rather than deleting tokens.
           This will allow programs started in the user's PAG that  are  still  running  when  the  log  out  to
           continue  to  use  the  user's  tokens  until  they  expire.   Normally,  the  AFS kernel module will
           automatically clean up tokens once every process in that PAG has terminated.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       KRB5CCNAME
           This module looks for KRB5CCNAME in the PAM environment and by default does not run <b>aklog</b>  if  it  is
           not set.

       The  entire  PAM  environment  is  passed to <b>aklog</b> as its environment (rather than the environment of the
       process running the PAM functions).

</pre><h4><b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       As mentioned above, this module implements a dummy pam_authenticate function so that  it  can  provide  a
       pam_setcred function.  Never list this module as "sufficient" or as the only "required" module or you may
       allow users to log on without a password.

       While spawning an external <b>aklog</b> program, the AFS session PAM module resets the SIGCHLD signal handler to
       the  default handler while the program runs and then restores it afterward.  This is done to avoid having
       aklog interfere with process handling in the calling application,  but  it  means  that  there's  a  race
       condition  that  can cause children to be incorrectly handled if they exit while aklog is running.  There
       is unfortunately no good solution to this other than building  against  Heimdal  and  using  the  libkafs
       interface to obtain tokens instead of an external program.

       To  detect  whether  AFS  is  running on the system, the AFS session PAM module temporarily sets a SIGSYS
       handler before attempting an AFS system call.  That handler may also modify a static  variable.   Neither
       of  these should ideally be done in a PAM module, but there is no other good way of checking for the non-
       existence of a system call that doesn't crash the application on some operating systems.  The PAM  module
       will  attempt  to  restore  the  previous  SIGSYS handler, if any, after the test is done, and the static
       variable is used in such a way that running it from multiple threads shouldn't be an issue, but be  aware
       that  the  PAM  module  is  doing  this behind the back of the application and may interfere with unusual
       SIGSYS handlers or similar application actions.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       When using the libkafs interface to obtain tokens, be sure that it is configured properly for the type of
       AFS tokens expected at your site.  As of Heimdal 0.7, the default  behavior  is  to  contact  the  krb524
       service  to  translate  Kerberos v5 tickets into Kerberos v4 tickets to use as tokens.  AFS cells running
       current server software no longer need this, and if your site doesn't run the krb524  service,  this  may
       break token acquisition.

       Sites running AFS servers that understand Kerberos-v5-derived tokens should add configuration like:

           libkafs = {
               EXAMPLE.ORG = {
                   afs-use-524 = no
               }
           }

       to  the  [appdefaults]  section  of  their <u>krb5.conf</u> files to disable use of the krb524 service.  See the
       Heimdal <u><a href="../man3/kafs.3.html">kafs</a></u>(3) man page for more information.
