</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ha.cf - Configuration file for the Heartbeat cluster messaging layer

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/ha.d/ha.cf is read by <b><a href="../man8/heartbeat.8.html">heartbeat</a></b>(8) upon node start-up. It lists the communication facilities enabled
       between nodes, enables or disables certain features, and optionally lists the cluster nodes by host name.

       This file can safely be made world readable, but should be writable only by root.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b></h4><pre>
       Some directives in ha.cf are global in nature. The order of these global options is important in
       configuring the ha.cf file, since each directive is interpreted as it is encountered in ha.cf.

       These directives are <b>use_logd</b> and <b>udpport</b>. It is recommended that these be placed first in the ha.cf file
       when they are entered.

       Other directives in this category are <b>baud</b>, <b>logfacility</b>, <b>logfile</b>, and <b>debugfile</b>, but those directives are
       deprecated and should no longer be used.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b></h4><pre>
       The following directives are supported in ha.cf (listed here in alphabetical order):

       <b>apiauth</b>
           This directive specifies what users and/or groups are allowed to connect to a specific API group
           name. The syntax is simple:

               apiauth apigroupname [uid=uid1,uid2 ...] [gid=gid1,gid2 ...]

           You can specify either a uid list, or a gid list, or both. However you must specify either a uid list
           or a gid list. If you include both a uid list and a gid list, then a process is authorized to connect
           to that API group if if it is either in the uid-list or it is in the gid-list.

           The API group name default has special meaning. If it is specified, it will be used for authorizing
           clients without any API group name, and all client groups not identified by any other apiauth
           directive.

           Unless you specify otherwise in the ha.cf file, certain services will be provided default
           authorizations as follows:

           <b>Table</b> <b>1.</b> <b>Default</b> <b>service</b> <b>authorizations</b>
           ┌───────────────┬─────────────────┐
           │ <b>Service</b>       │ <b>Default</b> <b>apiauth</b> │
           ├───────────────┼─────────────────┤
           │ ipfail        │ uid=hacluster   │
           ├───────────────┼─────────────────┤
           │ ccm           │ gid=haclient    │
           ├───────────────┼─────────────────┤
           │ ping          │ gid=haclient    │
           ├───────────────┼─────────────────┤
           │ cl_status     │ gid=haclient    │
           ├───────────────┼─────────────────┤
           │ lha-snmpagent │ uid=root        │
           ├───────────────┼─────────────────┤
           │ crmd          │ uid=hacluster   │
           └───────────────┴─────────────────┘

       <b>autojoin</b>
           The autojoin directive enables nodes to join automatically just by communicating with the cluster,
           hence not requiring node directives in the ha.cf file. Since our communication is normally strongly
           authenticated, only nodes which know the cluster key can join (automatically or otherwise).

           The values you can give for the autojoin directive have the following meanings:

           •   none: disables automatic joining.

           •   other: allows nodes other than ourself who are not listed in ha.cf to join automatically. In
               other words, our node has to be listed in ha.cf, but other nodes do not.

           •   any: allows any node to join automatically without being listed in ha.cf, even the current node.

           Note that the set of nodes currently considered part of the cluster is kept in the hostcache file.
           With autojoin enabled, the node directive is no longer authoritative - the hostcache file is.

       <b>bcast</b>
           The bcast directive is used to configure which interfaces Heartbeat sends UDP broadcast traffic on.
           More than one interface can be specified on the line. The udpport directive is used to configure
           which port is used for these broadcast communications if the udpport directive is specified before
           the bcast directive, otherwise the default port will be used. A couple of sample bcast lines are
           shown below.

               bcast eth0 eth1  # on Linux systems
               bcast le0        # for Solaris systems

               <b>Note</b>
               Broadcast links are not supported in Pacemaker clusters on BSD systems.

       <b>compression</b>
           The compression directive sets which compression method will be used when a message is big and
           compression is needed.

           It could be either zlib or bz2, depending on whether you have the corresponding library in the
           system. You can check /usr/lib/heartbeat/plugins/compress, to see what compression module is
           available. Requires cluster-glue &gt;= 1.0.10.

           If this directive is not set, there will be no compression.

       <b>compression_threshold</b>
           The compression_threshold directive sets the threshold to compress a message, e.g. if the threshold
           is 1, then any message with size greater than 1 KB will be compressed. The default is 2 (KB). This
           directive only makes sense if you have set the compression directive.

       <b>conn_logd_time</b>
           The conn_logd_time directive specifies the time Heartbeat will reconnect to the logging daemon if the
           connection between Heartbeat and the logging daemon is broken. The conn_logd_time is specified
           according to the Heartbeat time syntax, for example:

               conn_logd_time 60 #60 seconds

           The default is 60 seconds.

               <b>Note</b>
               Heartbeat will not automatically reconnect to the logging daemon. It only tries to reconnect when
               it needs to log a message and conn_logd_time have passed since the last attempt to connect.

       <b>coredumps</b>
           The coredumps directive tells Heartbeat to do things to enable making core dumps - should it need to
           dump core.

           The allowed values are <b>true</b> and <b>false</b>.

       <b>crm</b>
           historical, for Cluster Resource Manager, now an alias to <b>pacemaker</b>

       <b>pacemaker</b>
           Enables the Pacemaker cluster manager. For historical reasons, the default for this option is <b>off</b>;
           however, it should always be set to <b>respawn</b>.

           When set to <b>respawn</b>, the directive automatically implies, with proper search paths, something similar
           to:

               apiauth cib             uid=hacluster
               apiauth crmd            uid=hacluster
               apiauth stonithd        uid=root
               apiauth stonithd-ng     uid=root
               apiauth attrd           uid=hacluster
               apiauth pingd           uid=root

               respawn hacluster       ccm
               respawn hacluster       cib
               respawn root        stonithd
               respawn root        lrmd
               respawn hacluster       attrd
               respawn hacluster       pengine
               respawn hacluster       crmd

       <b>crm_daemon_dir</b>
           The paths where heartbeat looks first for pacemaker daemons (cib, lrmd, stonithd, pengine, attd,
           crmd, see above). If not set, uses /usr/libexec/pacemaker. Always falls back to
           /usr/libexec/heartbeat. (both hardcoded at compile time). If any daemon is not found or inaccessible
           at startup time, this is treated as a configuration error and startup fails.

       <b>crmd_spawns_pengine</b>
           If pacemaker crmd spawns the pengine (policy engine daemon) itself, it sometimes "forgets" to kill
           the pengine on shutdown, which later may confuse the system after cluster restart.
           "crmd_spawns_pengine off" tells the system that Heartbeat is supposed to control the pengine
           directly.

       <b>deadtime</b>
           The deadtime directive is used to specify how quickly Heartbeat should decide that a node in a
           cluster is dead. Setting this value too low will cause the system to falsely declare itself dead.
           Setting it too high will delay takeover after the failure of a node in the cluster.

       <b>debug</b>
           The debug directive is used to set the level of debugging in effect in the system. Production systems
           should have their debug level set to zero (i.e., turned off). This is the default. Legal values of
           the debug option are between 0-255. The most useful values are between 0 (off) and 3. Setting the
           debug level greater than 1 can have an adverse effect on the size of your log files, and on the
           system's ability to send heartbeats at rapid rates, thus affecting the cluster reliability.

           The debug level of the system can also be specified on the command line using the -d option.
           Additionally, the debug level of the system can be dynamically changed by sending the heartbeat
           process SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals. SIGUSR1 raises the debug level, and SIGUSR2 lowers it.

       <b>hbgenmethod</b> time|file
           The hbgenmethod directive specifies how Heartbeat should compute its current generation number for
           communications. This is a specialized and obscure directive, used mainly in firewalls which have no
           local disk, and other devices which do not have a method of storing data persistently across reboots.
           It defaults to storing the Heartbeat generations in a file. Generation numbers are used by Heartbeat
           for replay attack protection.

               <b>Warning</b>
               If one specifies the time method, there are certain possible cases where troubles can arise. If a
               machine restarts Heartbeat and its local time of day clock is less than or equal to than the
               value of the time of day clock when Heartbeat last started, then that node will be unable to join
               the cluster.

       <b>initdead</b>
           The initdead parameter is used to set the time that it takes to declare a cluster node dead when
           Heartbeat is first started. This parameter generally needs to be set to a higher value, because
           experience suggests that it sometimes takes operating systems many seconds for their communication
           systems before they operate correctly. initdead is specified according to the Heartbeat time syntax.
           A sample initdead value is shown below:

               initdead 30

           In some switched network environments, switches engage in a spanning tree algorithm whenever a NIC
           connects to a port. This can take a long time to complete, and it is only necessary if the NIC being
           connected is another switch. If this is the case, you may be able to configure certain NICs as not
           being switches and shrink the connection delay significantly. If not, you'll need to raise initdead
           to make this problem go away.

           If this is set too low, you'll see one node declare the other as dead.

       <b>keepalive</b>
           The keepalive directive sets the interval between heartbeat packets. It is specified according to the
           Heartbeat time syntax.

       <b>logfacility</b>
           The logfacility is used to tell Heartbeat which syslog logging facility it should use for logging its
           messages.

           The possible values for logfacility vary by operating system, but some of the most common ones are
           {auth, authpriv, daemon, syslog, user, local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5, local6,
           local7}.

           A sample logfacility directive is shown below:

               logfacility local7

           If you want to disable logging to syslog:

               logfacility none

       <b>mcast</b>
           The mcast directive is used to configure a multicast communication path. The syntax of an mcast
           directive is:

               mcast dev mcast-group udp-port ttl 0

           •   dev - IP device to send/rcv heartbeats on

           •   mcast-group - multicast group to join (class D multicast address 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255).
               For most Heartbeat uses, you should chose from "The IPv4 Organization Local Scope --
               239.192.0.0/14".

                   <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>use</b> <b>reserved</b> <b>or</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>multicast</b> <b>addresses.</b>
                   You likely would seriously confuse a lot of network devices.

           •   port - UDP port to sendto/rcvfrom (set this to the same value as udpport)

           •   ttl - the ttl value for outbound heartbeats. This affects how far the multicast packet will
               propagate. (0-255). Set to 1 for the current subnet. Must be greater than zero.

           A sample mcast directive is shown below:

               mcast eth0 239.0.0.1 694 1 0

       <b>mcast6</b>
           The mcast6 directive is to configure an IPv6 multicast communication path. The syntax of an mcast
           directive is:

               mcast6 [device] [mcast6 group] [port] [mcast6 hops] [mcast6 loop]

           For example, using link-local scope with some "transient" group:

               mcast6 eth0 ff12::1:2:3:4 694 1 0

           •   device - IP device to send/rcv heartbeats on

           •   mcast6 group - multicast group to join. Refer to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3513">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3513</a>#section-2.7
               for valid and reserved IPv6 multicast addresses.

               For most heartbeat uses, addresses should be taken from:

                   ff12::/16

               Plausibility checking code during config file parsing will reject some, but will probably not be
               able to catch all unsuitable addresses. Please understand the IPv6 multicast addressing scheme
               first.

                   <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>use</b> <b>reserved</b> <b>or</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>multicast</b> <b>addresses.</b>
                   You likely would seriously confuse a lot of network devices.

           •   port - UDP port to sendto/rcvfrom

           •   mcast6 hops - affects how far the multicast packet will propagate (sockopt: IPV6_MULTICAST_HOPS).
               (0-4). Set to 1 for link-local.

           •   loop - sockopt IPV6_MULTICAST_LOOP; always set to 0

       <b>msgfmt</b> classic|netstring
           The msgfmt directive specifies the format Heartbeat uses in wire.

           •   classic - Heartbeat will convert a message into a string and transmit in wire. Binary values are
               converted with a base64 library.

           •   netstring - Binary messages will be transmitted directly. This is more efficient since it avoids
               conversion between string and binary values.

           When in doubt, leave the default (classic).

       <b>node</b>
           The node directive tells what machines are in the cluster. The syntax of the node directive is
           simple:

               node nodename1 nodename2 ...

           Node names in the directive must match the "uname -n" of that machine.

           You can declare multiple node names in one directive. You can also use the directive multiple times.
           Normally every node in the cluster must be listed in the ha.cf file, including the current node,
           unless the autojoin directive is enabled.

           The node directive is not completely authoritative with regard to nodes heartbeat will communicate
           with. If a node has ever been added in the past, it will tend to remain in the hostcache file more
           until it's manually removed.

       <b>realtime</b> on|off
           The realtime directive specifies whether or not Heartbeat should try and take advantage of the
           operating system's realtime scheduling features. When enabled, Heartbeat will lock itself into
           memory, and raise its priority to a realtime priority (as set by the rtprio directive). This feature
           is mainly used for debugging various kinds of loops which might otherwise cripple the system and
           impair debugging them.

           The default is on.

       <b>rtprio</b>
           The rtprio directive is used to specify the priority at which Heartbeat runs. It does not need to be
           specified unless other realtime priority programs are also running on the system. The minimum and
           maximum values for this field can be determined from the sched_get_priority_min(SCHED_FIFO) and
           sched_get_priority_max(SCHED_FIFO) calls respectively. The default value for rtprio is halfway
           between the minimum and maximum values.

           A sample rtprio directive is shown below:

               rtprio 5

       <b>ucast</b>
           The ucast directive configures Heartbeat to communicate over a UDP unicast communications link. The
           udpport directive is used to configure which port is used for these unicast communications if the
           udpport directive is specified before the ucast directive, otherwise the default port will be used.

           The general syntax of a ucast directive is:

               ucast dev peer-ip-address

           Where dev is the device to use when talking to the peer, and peer-ip-address is the IP address we
           will send packets to.

           A sample ucast directive is shown below:

               ucast eth0 10.10.10.133

           This directive will cause us to send packets to 10.10.10.133 over interface eth0.

           Note that ucast directives which go to the local machine are effectively ignored. This allows the
           ha.cf directives on all machines to be identical.

       <b>ucast6</b>
           The ucast6 directive configures Heartbeat to communicate over a IPv6 UDP unicast communications link.
           The udpport directive is used to configure which port is used for these unicast communications if the
           udpport directive is specified before the ucast directive, otherwise the default port will be used.

           The general syntax of a ucast6 directive is:

               ucast dev peer-ipv6-address

           Where dev is the device to use when talking to the peer, and peer-ip-address is the IP address we
           will send packets to.

           A sample ucast directive is shown below:

               ucast6  eth1 fe80::5054:ff:fe29:3949

           This directive will cause us to send packets to the specified (in this example: link-local) address
           via the specified interface.

           As the sockets will be bound to the specified interface, you have to ensure the specified address is
           in fact reachable via that interface.

           For link-local addresses, you may explicitly specify the "scope-id" (in the example you would add
           %eth1 to the address). If you do, it has to match the device. If you leave it off, the specified
           device name is implied.

           Note that ucast6 directives which go to the local machine are effectively ignored. This allows the
           ha.cf directives on all machines to be identical.

       <b>udpport</b>
           The udpport directive specifies which port Heartbeat will use for its UDP intra-cluster
           communication. There are two common reasons for overriding this value: there are multiple bcast
           clusters on the same subnet, or this port is already in use in accordance with some
           locally-established policy.

           The default value for this parameter is the the port ha-cluster in <a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a> (if present), or 694
           if port ha-cluster is not in /etc/services. 694 is the IANA registered port number for Heartbeat
           (a.k.a. ha-cluster).

           A sample udpport directive is shown below.

               udpport 694

           You have to configure udpport (in ha.cf) <u>before</u> you configure ucast or bcast, if not heartbeat will
           use the default port (694).

               <b>Note</b>
               Due to a specification error in the syntax of the mcast directive, this directive does not apply
               to mcast communications.

       <b>use_logd</b> on|off
           The use_logd directive specifies whether Heartbeat logs its messages through logging daemon or not.

           If the logging daemon is used, all log messages will be sent through IPC to the logging daemon, which
           then writes them into log files. In case the logging daemon dies (for whatever reason), a warning
           message will be logged and all messages will be written to log files directly.

           If the logging daemon is used, logfile/debugfile/logfacility in this file are not meaningful any
           longer. You should check the config file for logging daemon (the default is /etc/logd.cf).

           If use_logd is not used, all log messages will be written to log files directly.

           The logging daemon is started/stopped in heartbeat script.

           Setting use_logd to "on" is recommended.

       <b>uuidfrom</b>
           In the normal case, heartbeat generates a UUID for each node in the system as a way of uniquely
           identifying a node - even if it should change nodenames. This UUID is typically stored in the file
           /var/lib/heartbeat/hb_uuid.

           For certain kinds of installations (those booting from CDs or other read-only media), it is
           impossible for heartbeat to save a generated to disk as it normally does. In these cases, one can use
           the uuidfrom directive to instruct heartbeat to use the nodename as though it were a UUID, by
           specifying uuidfrom nodename.

           All possible legal uuidfrom directives are shown below.

               uuidfrom file
               uuidfrom nodename

       <b>warntime</b>
           The warntime directive is used to specify how quickly Heartbeat should issue a "late heartbeat"
           warning.

           The warntime value is specified according to the HeartbeatTimeSyntax. A sample warntime specification
           is shown below.

               warntime 10    # 10 seconds

           The warntime directive is important for tuning deadtime

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATED</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b></h4><pre>
       The following directives are interpreted by the configuration file parser for historical reasons, but
       should be considered deprecated and should no longer be used.

       <b>auto_failback</b>
           In legacy Heartbeat clusters, the auto_failback option would determine whether a resource would
           automatically fail back to its "primary" node, or remain on whatever node is serving it until that
           node fails, or an administrator intervenes. The possible values for auto_failback were:

           •   on - enable automatic failbacks

           •   off - disable automatic failback

           •   legacy - enable automatic failbacks in systems where all nodes in the cluster do not yet support
               the auto_failback option.

           This option has been replaced the configurable failback policies in Pacemaker, and should no longer
           be used.

       <b>baud</b>
           The baud directive is used to set the speed for serial communications. Any of the following speeds
           can be specified, provided they are supported by your operating system: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600,
           115200, 230400, 460800. The default speed is 19200.

           This option is obsolete as serial links should not be used in Pacemaker clusters.

       <b>deadping</b>
           The deadping directive is used to specify how quickly Heartbeat should decide that a ping node in a
           cluster is dead. Setting this value too low will cause the system to falsely declare the ping node
           dead. Setting it too high will delay detection of communication failure.

           This feature has been replaced by the more flexible pingd resource agent in Pacemaker, and should no
           longer be used.

       <b>debugfile</b>
           The debugfile directive specifies the file Heartbeat will write debug messages to.

           This directive is ignored when <b>use_logd</b> is specified. Enabling <b>use_logd</b> is the recommended approach.

       <b>hbaping</b>
           Hbaping directives are given to declare fiber channel devices as ping nodes.

           This directive was never fully supported in Heartbeat (requiring manual modifications to the code
           base) and should not be used.

       <b>hopfudge</b>
           The hopfudge directive controls how many nodes a packet can be forwarded through before it is thrown
           away in the worst case. However, the hopfudge value is added to the number of nodes in the system. It
           defaults to 1.

           This option applies to serial links only, which are deprecated.

       <b>logfile</b>
           The logfile directive configures a log file. All non-debug messages from Heartbeat will go into this
           file.

           This directive is ignored when <b>use_logd</b> is specified. Enabling <b>use_logd</b> is the recommended approach.

       <b>ping</b>
           Ping directives are given to declare ping nodes to Heartbeat. The syntax of the ping directive is
           simple:

               ping ip-address ...

           Each IP address listed in a ping directive is considered to be independent. That is, connectivity to
           each node is considered to be equally important.

           In order to declare that a group of nodes are equally qualified for a particular function, and that
           the presence of any of them indicates successful communication, use the ping_group directive.

           This feature has been replaced by the more flexible pingd resource agent in Pacemaker, and should no
           longer be used.

       <b>ping_group</b>
           Ping group directives are given to declare a group ping node to Heartbeat. syntax of the ping_group
           directive is as follows:

               ping_group group-name ip-address ...

           Each IP address listed in a ping_group directive is considered to be related, and connectivity to any
           one node is considered to be connectivity to the group.

           A ping group is considered by Heartbeat to be a single cluster node (group-name). The ability to
           communicate with any of the group members means that the group-name member is reachable. This is
           useful when (for example) two different routers may be used to contact the internet, depending on
           which is up, or when finding an appropriate reliable single ping node is difficult.

           This feature has been replaced by the more flexible pingd resource agent in Pacemaker, and should no
           longer be used.

       <b>respawn</b>
           The respawn directive is used to specify a program to run and monitor while it runs. If this program
           exits with anything other than exit code 100, it will be automatically restarted. The first parameter
           is the user id to run the program under, and the second parameter is the program to run. Subsequent
           parameters will be given to the program as arguments.

           This functionality was primarily designed for the legacy ipfail program, which has been replaced by
           the more flexible pingd resource agent in Pacemaker. Thus, this directive should no longer be used,
           except when it is implicitly generated by <b>pacemaker</b> <b>yes</b>.

       <b>serial</b>
           The serial directive tells Heartbeat to use the specified serial port(s) for its communication. The
           parameters to the serial directive are the names of tty devices suitable for opening without waiting
           for carrier first. On Linux, those ports are typically named /dev/ttySX.

           A few sample serial directives are shown below:

               serial /dev/ttyS0 /dev/ttyS1     # Linux
               serial /dev/cuaa0                # FreeBSD
               serial /dev/cua/a                # Solaris

           The baud directive is used to configure the baud rate for the port(s) if the baud directive is
           specified before the serial directive, otherwise the default baud rate will be used.

           Using this option is <u>strongly</u> discouraged in Pacemaker clusters, as its CIB updates can easily hit
           practical message size limits for serial links, with undefined results.

       <b>stonith</b>
           The stonith directive is used to configure Heartbeat's legacy STONITH configuration. It assumes
           you're going to put in a STONITH configuration file on each machine in the cluster to configure the
           (single) STONITH device that this node will use to reset the other node in the cluster.

           This functionality has been replaced by STONITH agents in Pacemaker.

       <b>stonith_host</b>
           The stonith_host directive is used to configure Heartbeat's (release 1 only), STONITH configuration.
           With this directive, you put all the STONITH configuration information for the devices in your
           cluster in the ha.cf file, rather than in a separate file.

           This functionality has been replaced by STONITH agents in Pacemaker.

       <b>traditional_compression</b> on|off
           This directive enables traditional compression (messages are compressed as a whole, including message
           header information). Defaults to off. Pacemaker clusters with significant number of node/resources
           may need to enable this, because Pacemaker not always chose to send compressible payload field types.
           If uncompressed packet sizes exceed maximum message size, this method may be tried implicitly as a
           fallback, even if switched off. You should combine this with a sufficiently high
           compression_threshold. May impact real time performance.

       <b>watchdog</b>
           The watchdog directive configures Heartbeat to use a watchdog device. In some circumstances, a
           watchdog device can be used in place of a STONITH device. In any case, it is a reasonable thing to
           configure if you don't have a STONITH device, or if you wish, in addition to your STONITH device.

           It is the purpose of a watchdog device to shut the machine down if Heartbeat does not hear its own
           heartbeats as often as it thinks it should. This keeps things like scheduler bugs from becoming
           split-brain configurations.

           The general syntax of a watchdog directive is:

               watchdog watchdog-device-name

           A sample watchdog directive is shown below:

               watchdog /dev/watchdog

           The most common watchdog device currently used with general Linux systems is the softdog device. The
           softdog device is a software-based watchdog device and is usually referred to as /dev/watchdog -
           although like most UNIX devices, this is a convention not a rule.

           This functionality has been replaced by cluster self-monitoring and STONITH resource agents in
           Pacemaker. This directive should no longer be used.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIRED</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b></h4><pre>
       The following directives must always be present in ha.cf:

       •   At least one communication topology directive (<b>bcast</b>, <b>mcast</b>, or <b>ucast</b>);

       •   Either one or more <b>node</b> directives, or <b>autojoin</b> <b>any</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Below is an example ha.cf for a 2-node Pacemaker cluster with redundant network communication paths:

           # LOGGING: your choice.
           #
           # Note: if you want pacemaker to NOT write any log file at all,
           # you may need to explicitly use: logfile /dev/null
           # (and use a recent cluster glue!)
           #
           # logfile /var/log/ha.log
           # debugfile /var/log/ha-debug.log
           # logfacility local7
           # or use logd, which is configured in /etc/logd.cf
           # use_logd on

           # If pacemaker crmd spawns the pengine itself,
           # it sometimes "forgets" to kill the pengine on shutdown,
           # which later may confuse the system after cluster restart.
           # Tell the system that Heartbeat is supposed to control the pengine directly.
           crmd_spawns_pengine off
