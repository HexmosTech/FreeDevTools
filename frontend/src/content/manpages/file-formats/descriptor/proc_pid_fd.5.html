       /proc/pid/fd/ - file descriptors

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/fd/</u>
              This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the process has open, named by its
              file  descriptor,  and  which is a symbolic link to the actual file.  Thus, 0 is standard input, 1
              standard output, 2 standard error, and so on.

              For file descriptors for pipes and sockets, the entries will be symbolic links  whose  content  is
              the file type with the inode.  A <b><a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink</a></b>(2) call on this file returns a string in the format:

                  type:[inode]

              For  example, <u>socket:[2248868]</u> will be a socket and its inode is 2248868.  For sockets, that inode
              can be used to find more information in one of the files under <u><a href="file:/proc/net/">/proc/net/</a></u>.

              For file descriptors that have no corresponding inode (e.g., file descriptors produced by  <b><a href="../man2/bpf.2.html">bpf</a></b>(2),
              <b><a href="../man2/epoll_create.2.html">epoll_create</a></b>(2),  <b><a href="../man2/eventfd.2.html">eventfd</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/inotify_init.2.html">inotify_init</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/perf_event_open.2.html">perf_event_open</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/signalfd.2.html">signalfd</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/timerfd_create.2.html">timerfd_create</a></b>(2),
              and <b><a href="../man2/userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd</a></b>(2)), the entry will be a symbolic link with contents of the form

                  anon_inode:<u>file-type</u>

              In many cases (but not all), the <u>file-type</u> is surrounded by square brackets.

              For example, an epoll file descriptor will have a  symbolic  link  whose  content  is  the  string
              <u>anon_inode:[eventpoll]</u>.

              In  a  multithreaded  process, the contents of this directory are not available if the main thread
              has already terminated (typically by calling <b><a href="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit</a></b>(3)).

              Programs that take a filename as a command-line argument, but don't take input from standard input
              if no argument is supplied, and programs that write to a file named as  a  command-line  argument,
              but  don't  send  their  output to standard output if no argument is supplied, can nevertheless be
              made to use standard input  or  standard  output  by  using  <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/fd</u>  files  as  command-line
              arguments.  For example, assuming that <u>-i</u> is the flag designating an input file and <u>-o</u> is the flag
              designating an output file:

                  $ <b>foobar</b> <b>-i</b> <b><a href="file:/proc/self/fd/0">/proc/self/fd/0</a></b> <b>-o</b> <b>/proc/self/fd/1</b> <b>...</b>

              and you have a working filter.

              <u>/proc/self/fd/N</u>  is  approximately the same as <u>/dev/fd/N</u> in some UNIX and UNIX-like systems.  Most
              Linux MAKEDEV scripts symbolically link <u><a href="file:/dev/fd">/dev/fd</a></u> to <u><a href="file:/proc/self/fd">/proc/self/fd</a></u>, in fact.

              Most systems provide symbolic links <u><a href="file:/dev/stdin">/dev/stdin</a></u>, <u>/dev/stdout</u>, and <u>/dev/stderr</u>,  which  respectively
              link  to  the files <u>0</u>, <u>1</u>, and <u>2</u> in <u><a href="file:/proc/self/fd">/proc/self/fd</a></u>.  Thus the example command above could be written
              as:

                  $ <b>foobar</b> <b>-i</b> <b><a href="file:/dev/stdin">/dev/stdin</a></b> <b>-o</b> <b>/dev/stdout</b> <b>...</b>

              Permission to dereference or read (<b><a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink</a></b>(2)) the symbolic links in this directory  is  governed
              by a ptrace access mode <b>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS</b> check; see <b><a href="../man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace</a></b>(2).

              Note  that  for  file descriptors referring to inodes (pipes and sockets, see above), those inodes
              still have permission bits and ownership information  distinct  from  those  of  the  <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/fd</u>
              entry,  and that the owner may differ from the user and group IDs of the process.  An unprivileged
              process may lack permissions to open them, as in this example:

                  $ <b>echo</b> <b>test</b> <b>|</b> <b>sudo</b> <b>-u</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>cat</b>
                  test
                  $ <b>echo</b> <b>test</b> <b>|</b> <b>sudo</b> <b>-u</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>cat</b> <b><a href="file:/proc/self/fd/0">/proc/self/fd/0</a></b>
                  cat: <a href="file:/proc/self/fd/0">/proc/self/fd/0</a>: Permission denied

              File descriptor 0 refers to the pipe created by the shell and owned by that shell's user, which is
              not <u>nobody</u>, so <b>cat</b> does not have permission to create a new file  descriptor  to  read  from  that
              inode, even though it can still read from its existing file descriptor 0.
