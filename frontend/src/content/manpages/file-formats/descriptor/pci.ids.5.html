</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pci.ids - list of known identifiers related to PCI devices

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       Devices  on  the  PCI  bus  are  identified by a combination of a vendor ID (assigned by the PCI SIG) and
       device ID (assigned by the vendor). Both IDs are 16-bit  integers  and  the  device  itself  provides  no
       translation to a human-readable string.

       In addition to the vendor and device, devices also report several other identifiers:

       •  Device class and subclass (two 8-bit numbers)

       •  Programming interface (8-bit number, meaning specific for the subclass)

       •  Subsystem,  which  identifies  the assembly in which the device is contained.  A typical example is an
          Ethernet add-in card: the device is the Ethernet controller chip, while the card plays the role of the
          subsystem. Subsystems have their vendor ID (from the same namespace as device vendors)  and  subsystem
          ID.  Generally,  the meaning of the subsystem ID depends on the device, but there are cases in which a
          single subsystem ID is used for many devices - e.g., laptop motherboards.

          The PCI utilities use the <b>pci.ids</b> file to translate all these numeric IDs to strings.

</pre><h4><b>KEEPING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>LIST</b> <b>UP-TO-DATE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>pci.ids</b> file is generated from the PCI ID database, which is maintained  at  https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/.
       If you find any IDs missing from the list, please contribute them to the database.

       You can use the <b>update-pciids</b> command to download the current version of the list.

       Alternatively, you can use <b>lspci</b> <b>-q</b> to query the database online.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The  pci.ids  file is a text file in plain ASCII, interpreted line by line.  Lines starting with the hash
       sign are treated as comments are ignored.  Comments regarding a specific entry  are  written  immediately
       before the entry.

       Vendor  entries  start with a 4-digit hexadecimal vendor ID, followed by one or more spaces, and the name
       of the vendor extending to the end of the line.

       Device entries are placed below the vendor entry. Each device entry consists of a single TAB character, a
       4-digit hexadecimal device ID, followed by one or more spaces, and the name of the  device  extending  to
       the end of the line.

       Subsystem  entries  are  placed  below  the  device  entry. They start with two TAB characters, a 4-digit
       hexadecimal vendor ID (which must  be  defined  elsewhere  in  the  list),  a  single  space,  a  4-digit
       hexadecimal  subsystem  ID, one or more spaces, and the name of the subsystem extending to the end of the
       line.

       Class entries consist of "C", one space, 2-digit hexadecimal class ID, one or more spaces, and  the  name
       of  the class. Subclasses are placed below the corresponding class, indented by a single TAB, followed by
       a 2-digit hexadecimal subclass ID, one or more  spaces,  and  the  name  of  the  subclass.   Programming
       interfaces  are  below  the subclass, indented by two TABs, followed by a 2-digit hexadecimal prog-if ID,
       one or more spaces, and the name.

       There can be device-independent subsystem IDs, although the  web  interface  of  the  database  does  not
       support  them  yet.  They  start with a subsystem vendor line consisting of "S", one space, and a 4-digit
       hexadecimal vendor ID (which  must  correspond  to  an  already  listed  vendor).  Subsystems  follow  on
       subsequent  lines,  each indented by one TAB, followed by a 4-digit hexadecimal subsystem ID, one or more
       spaces, and the name of the subsystem.

       To ensure extensibility of the format, lines starting with an unrecognized letter followed  by  a  single
       space are ignored and so are all following TAB-indented lines.
