       glyphs - format of .glyphs files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Glyph  files  (``.glyph''  extension)  are  used  to store commonly-used bit patterns (glyphs) for Magic.
       Right now, the bit patterns are used for two  purposes  in  Magic.   First,  they  specify  patterns  for
       programmable  cursors:  each cursor shape (e.g. the arrow used for the wiring tool) is read in as a glyph
       from a glyph file.  Second, glyphs are used by the window manager to represent the icons displayed at the
       ends of scroll bars.  Glyph file names normally have the extension <b>.glyph</b>.

       Glyph files are stored in ASCII format.  Lines beginning with ``#'' are considered to be comments and are
       ignored.  Blank lines are also ignored.  The first non-comment line in a glyph file must have the  syntax
       <b>size</b>  <u>nGlyphs</u> <u>width</u> <u>height</u> The <u>nGlyphs</u> field must be a number giving the total number of glyphs stored in
       the file.  The <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> fields give the dimensions of each glyph in pixels.  All  glyphs  in  the
       same file must have the same size.

       The  <b>size</b>  line is followed by a description for each of the glyphs.  Each glyph consists of <u>height</u> lines
       each containing 2×<u>width</u> characters. Each pair of characters corresponds to a bit position in  the  glyph,
       with the leftmost pair on the topmost line corresponding to the upper-left pixel in the glyph.

       The  first  character of each pair specifies the color to appear in that pixel.  The color is represented
       as as a single character, which must be the short name of a display style in the  current  display  style
       file.  Some commonly-used characters are <b>K</b> for black, <b>W</b> for white, and <b>.</b> for the background color (when <b>.</b>
       is  used  in  a cursor, it means that that pixel position is transparent:  the underlying picture appears
       through the cursor).  See ``Magic Maintainer's Manual #3: Display Styles, Color Maps,  and  Glyphs''  for
       more information.

       The  second  character of each pair is normally blank, except for one pixel per glyph which may contain a
       ``*'' in the second character.  The ``*'' is used for programmable cursors to indicate the hot-spot:  the
       pixel corresponding to the ``*'' is the one that the cursor is considered to point to.

       For an example of a glyph file, see ∼cad/lib/magic/sys/color.glyphs.
