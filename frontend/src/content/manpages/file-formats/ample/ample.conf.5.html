</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ample.conf - configuration file for Ample

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  file, by default <u>/etc/ample.conf</u>, is read by Ample at startup. There are three categories of values
       than can be defined: strings, numbers and boolean values. Valid boolean  values  are  (case  insensitive)
       yes, no, true and false. Lines that start with # are considered to be comments and ignored.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
              # An example of a Ample config file
              #

              # Port number to use
              port = 1234

              # Should files be ordered when playing a mixed stream?
              order = true

              # Amount of simultaneous clients allowed
              clients = 5

              # Path to logfile if syslog isn't used
              logfile = /var/log/ample

              # Path(s) to MP3 dir/file or M3U file
              mp3path = /home/mp3
              mp3path = /home/moremp3/zztop.mp3
              mp3path = /home/favourites.m3u

              # Path to the HTML file to use as a template
              htmlfile = /etc/ample.html

              # Should the MP3 dir(s) be recursively scanned?
              recursive = true

              # Name of the server
              # (displayed to clients here and there)
              servername = Ample

              # Address of the server
              # (only if your server can't be resolved)
              serveraddress = 192.168.0.1

              # Username and password, if these are specified, Ample
              # will automatically ask for username/password
              username = MusicLover
              password = Pekaboo

              # Filter to pass each music file through
              # (before they are sent to the client)
              filter = /usr/bin/lame -b64 --quiet "@FPATH@" -

              # The end

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>port=</b><u>NUM</u>
              Listen to TCP port <u>NUM</u>, default is 1234.

       <b>order=</b><u>BOOL</u>
              When a list of files is requested, and this option is <b>TRUE</b>, play them in alphabetical order.

       <b>clients=</b><u>NUM</u>
              Allow a maximum of <u>NUM</u> clients to be connected at the same time.

       <b>logfile=</b><u>FILE</u>
              Use <u>FILE</u> as logfile if <b><a href="../man8/syslogd.8.html">syslogd</a></b>(8) isn't used.

       <b>mp3path=</b><u>PATH</u>
              These  are  path(s)  to files or directories that Ample can use to populate it's list of MP3's. If
              <u>PATH</u> is a directory, all files (possibly recursively, see the <b>-n</b> option above) will be  added.  If
              <u>PATH</u>  is  a regular file ending with .mp3 it will be added and if it is a regular file ending with
              .m3u (MP3 playlist) the files listed in it will be added. You can specify several paths by  adding
              several <b>mp3path=</b><u>PATH</u> lines to this config file.

       <b>htmlfile=</b><u>FILE</u>
              This  is  the  path  to  the file which Ample should use as it's base for creating HTML pages. See
              <b><a href="../man5/ample.html.5.html">ample.html</a></b>(5) for more information.

       <b>recursive=</b><u>BOOL</u>
              If <b>TRUE</b>, all directories that Ample index:es will be scanned recursively (meaning that all subdirs
              will be checked for files as well)

       <b>servername=</b><u>STRING</u>
              The name of the server will be set to <u>STRING</u> instead of "Ample" (the servername  is  displayed  to
              clients in various places).

       <b>serveraddress=</b><u>STRING</u>
              <u>STRING</u>  should  be  the  IP  address  of the server where Ample is run. This is only needed if DNS
              resolving your server, for some reason, doesn't work.

       <b>username=</b><u>STRING</u>
              If both username and password is specified  in  the  config  file,  HTTP  authentication  will  be
              enabled. This means that if a client wants to connect to ample, it must do so with a username  and
              password  in  order  to be granted access. If username or password is missing, HTTP authentication
              will be disabled.

       <b>password=</b><u>STRING</u>
              See the description of username above.

       <b>filter=</b><u>STRING</u>
              Specifies an optional filter to run each file through before it is sent  to  the  client.   As  an
              example,  this  could  be  used  to  downgrade the bitrate of a music file if you have a lousy net
              connection but lots of CPU cycles to spare. If  <u>STRING</u>  contains  the  word  @FPATH@  it  will  be
              replaced with the absolute path of the file.
