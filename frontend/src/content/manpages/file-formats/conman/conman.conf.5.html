</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       conman.conf - ConMan daemon configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>conman.conf</b> configuration file is used to specify the consoles being managed by <b>conmand</b>.

       Comments  are  introduced  by  a  hash sign (#), and continue until the end of the line.  Blank lines and
       white-space are ignored.  Directives are terminated by a newline, but may span multiple lines by escaping
       it (i.e., immediately preceding the newline with a backslash).  Strings may be  either  single-quoted  or
       double-quoted, but they may not contain newlines.  Keywords are case-insensitive.

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b></h4><pre>
       These directives begin with the <b>SERVER</b> keyword followed by one of the following key/value pairs:

       <b>coredump</b> <b>=</b> (<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>)
              Specifies  whether  the daemon should generate a core dump file.  This file will be created in the
              current working directory (or '/' when running in the background) unless you also set <b>coredumpdir</b>.
              The default is <b>off</b>.

       <b>coredumpdir</b> <b>=</b> "<u>directory</u>"
              Specifies the directory where the daemon tries to write core dump files.  The  default  is  empty,
              meaning the current working directory (or '/' when running in the background) will be used.

       <b>execpath</b> <b>=</b> "<u>dir1:dir2:dir3...</u>"
              Specifies  a  colon-separated  list  of  directories in which to search for external process-based
              console executables that are not defined by an absolute or  relative  pathname.   The  default  is
              empty.

       <b>keepalive</b> <b>=</b> (<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>)
              Specifies whether the daemon will use TCP keep-alives for detecting dead connections.  The default
              is <b>on</b>.

       <b>logdir</b> <b>=</b> "<u>directory</u>"
              Specifies  a  directory  prefix for log files that are not defined via an absolute pathname.  This
              affects the <b>server</b> <b>logfile</b>, <b>global</b> <b>log</b>, and <b>console</b> <b>log</b> directives.

       <b>logfile</b> <b>=</b> "<u>file</u>[,<u>priority</u>]"
              Specifies the file to which log messages are  appended  if  the  daemon  is  not  running  in  the
              foreground.   This string undergoes conversion specifier expansion (see <b>CONVERSION</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b>)
              each time the file is opened.  If an absolute pathname  is  not  given,  the  file's  location  is
              relative to either <b>logdir</b> (if defined) or the current working directory.  Intermediate directories
              will  be  created  as  needed.   The  filename may optionally be followed by a comma and a minimum
              priority at which messages will be logged.  Refer to <b><a href="../man5/syslog.conf.5.html">syslog.conf</a>(5)</b> for a list of priorities.  The
              default priority is <b>info</b>.  If this keyword  is  used  in  conjunction  with  the  <b>syslog</b>  keyword,
              messages will be sent to both locations.

       <b>loopback</b> <b>=</b> (<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>)
              Specifies  whether the daemon will bind its socket to the loopback address, thereby only accepting
              local client connections directed to that address (127.0.0.1).  The default is <b>on</b>.

       <b>nofile</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Specifies the maximum number of open files for the daemon.  If set to 0, use  the  current  (soft)
              limit.  If set to -1, use the the maximum (hard) limit.  The default is 0.

       <b>pidfile</b> <b>=</b> "<u>file</u>"
              Specifies the file to which the daemon's PID is written.  Intermediate directories will be created
              as  needed.   The  use  of a pidfile is recommended if you want to use the daemon's '<b>-k</b>', '<b>-q</b>', or
              '<b>-r</b>' options.

       <b>port</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Specifies the port on which the daemon will listen for client connections.

       <b>resetcmd</b> <b>=</b> "<u>string</u>"
              Specifies a command string to be invoked by a  subshell  upon  receipt  of  the  client's  "reset"
              escape.   Multiple  commands  within  a  string  may  be  separated  with semicolons.  This string
              undergoes conversion specifier expansion (see  <b>CONVERSION</b>  <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b>)  and  will  be  invoked
              multiple times if the client is connected to multiple consoles.

       <b>syslog</b> <b>=</b> "<u>facility</u>"
              Specifies  that  log messages are to be sent to the system logger (<b>syslogd</b>) at the given facility.
              Refer to <b><a href="../man5/syslog.conf.5.html">syslog.conf</a>(5)</b> for a list of facilities.  If this keyword is used in conjunction with the
              <b>logfile</b> keyword, messages will be sent to both locations.

       <b>tcpwrappers</b> <b>=</b> (<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>)
              Specifies whether the daemon will use TCP-Wrappers when accepting client connections.  Support for
              this feature must be enabled  at  compile-time  (via  configure's  "--with-tcp-wrappers"  option).
              Refer to <b><a href="../man5/hosts_access.5.html">hosts_access</a>(5)</b> and <b><a href="../man5/hosts_options.5.html">hosts_options</a>(5)</b> for more details.  The default is <b>off</b>.

       <b>timestamp</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u> <b>(m</b>|<b>h</b>|<b>d</b>)
              Specifies  the  interval  between  timestamps  written  to  the individual console log files.  The
              interval is an integer that may be followed by a single-character modifier; '<b>m</b>' for  minutes  (the
              default), '<b>h</b>' for hours, or '<b>d</b>' for days.  The default is 0 (i.e., no timestamps).

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b></h4><pre>
       These directives begin with the <b>GLOBAL</b> keyword followed by one of the following key/value pairs:

       <b>log</b> <b>=</b> "<u>file</u>"
              Specifies  the  default  log  file  to  use  for  each  <b>console</b>  directive.  This string undergoes
              conversion specifier expansion (see <b>CONVERSION</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b>) each time the file  is  opened;  it
              must  contain  either  '<b>%N</b>' or '<b>%D</b>'.  If an absolute pathname is not given, the file's location is
              relative to either <b>logdir</b> (if defined) or the current working directory.  Intermediate directories
              will be created as needed.

       <b>logopts</b> <b>=</b> "(<b>lock</b>|<b>nolock</b>),(<b>sanitize</b>|<b>nosanitize</b>),(<b>timestamp</b>|<b>notimestamp</b>)"
              Specifies global options for the console log files.  These options can be  overridden  on  a  per-
              console  basis  by specifying the <b>CONSOLE</b> <b>logopts</b> keyword.  Note that options affecting the output
              of the console's logfile also affect the output of the console's  log-replay  escape.   The  valid
              <b>logopts</b> include the following:

              <b>lock</b> or <b>nolock</b> - locked logs are protected with a write lock.

              <b>sanitize</b>  or  <b>nosanitize</b>  -  sanitized  logs convert non-printable characters into 7-bit printable
              characters.

              <b>timestamp</b> or <b>notimestamp</b> - timestamped logs prepend each line of console output with  a  timestamp
              in  "YYYY-MM-DD  HH:MM:SS" format.  This timestamp is generated when the first character following
              the line break is output.

              The default is "<b>lock</b>,<b>nosanitize</b>,<b>notimestamp</b>".

       <b>seropts</b> <b>=</b> "<u>bps</u>[,<u>databits</u>[<u>parity</u>[<u>stopbits</u>]]]"
              Specifies global options for local serial devices.  These options can  be  overridden  on  a  per-
              console basis by specifying the <b>CONSOLE</b> <b>seropts</b> keyword.

              <u>bps</u>  is  an  integer  specifying  the  baud  rate  in bits-per-second.  If this exact value is not
              supported by the system, it will be rounded down to the next supported value.

              <u>databits</u> is an integer from 5-8.

              <u>parity</u> is a single case-insensitive character: '<b>n</b>' for none, '<b>o</b>' for odd, and '<b>e</b>' for even.

              <u>stopbits</u> is an integer from 1-2.

              The default is "9600,8n1" for 9600 bps, 8 data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit.

       <b>ipmiopts</b> <b>=</b> "<b>U</b>:<u>str</u>,<b>P</b>:<u>str</u>,<b>K</b>:<u>str</u>,<b>C</b>:<u>int</u>,<b>L</b>:<u>str</u>,<b>W</b>:<u>flag</u>"
              Specifies global options for IPMI Serial-Over-LAN devices.  These options can be overridden  on  a
              per-console basis by specifying the <b>CONSOLE</b> <b>IPMIOPTS</b> keyword.  This directive is only available if
              configured using the "--with-freeipmi" option.

              The  <b>IPMIOPTS</b> string is parsed into comma-delimited substrings where each substring is of the form
              "<u>X</u>:<u>VALUE</u>".  "<u>X</u>" is a single-character case-insensitive key specifying the option type, and "<u>VALUE</u>"
              is its corresponding value.  The IPMI default will be  used  if  a  key  is  not  specified.   The
              <b>/etc/freeipmi/libipmiconsole.conf</b>    file    can    contain    alternate   default   values;   see
              <b><a href="../man5/libipmiconsole.conf.5.html">libipmiconsole.conf</a>(5)</b>.  Note that since the <b>IPMIOPTS</b> string is  delimited  by  commas,  substring
              values cannot contain commas.

              The valid <b>IPMIOPTS</b> substrings include the following (in any order):

              <b>U</b>:<u>username</u> - a string of at most 16 bytes for the username.

              <b>P</b>:<u>password</u> - a string of at most 20 bytes for the password.

              <b>K</b>:<u>K_g</u> - a string of at most 20 bytes for the K_g key.

              <b>C</b>:<u>cipher_suite</u>  -  an integer for the IPMI cipher suite ID.  Refer to <b><a href="../man8/ipmiconsole.8.html">ipmiconsole</a>(8)</b> for a list of
              supported IDs.

              <b>L</b>:<u>privilege_level</u> - the string "user", "op", or "admin".

              <b>W</b>:<u>workaround_flag</u> - a string or integer  for  an  IPMI  workaround.   The  following  strings  are
              recognized:   "authcap",   "integritycheckvalue",  "intel20",  "nochecksumcheck",  "opensesspriv",
              "serialalertsdeferred",   "solchannelsupport",   "solpacketseq",   "solpayloadsize",    "solport",
              "solstatus",  "sun20",  "supermicro20",  "default",  and "none".  Refer to <b><a href="../man8/ipmiconsole.8.html">ipmiconsole</a>(8)</b> for more
              information on these workarounds.  This substring may be repeated in  order  to  specify  multiple
              workarounds.

              Both  the  <u>password</u>  and <u>K_g</u> values can be specified in either ASCII or hexadecimal; in the latter
              case, the string should begin with "0x" and contain at most 40  hexadecimal  digits.   A  <u>K_g</u>  key
              entered  in  hexadecimal  may  contain  embedded null characters, but any characters following the
              first null character in the <u>password</u> key will be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>CONSOLE</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b></h4><pre>
       This directive defines an individual console being  managed  by  the  daemon.   The  <b>CONSOLE</b>  keyword  is
       followed by one or more of the following key/value pairs:

       <b>name</b> <b>=</b> "<u>string</u>"
              Specifies the name used by clients to refer to the console.  This keyword is required.

       <b>dev</b> <b>=</b> "<u>string</u>"
              Specifies the type and location of the device.  This keyword is required.

              A local serial port connection is defined by the pathname of the character device file.

              A remote terminal server connection using the telnet protocol is defined by the "<u>host</u>:<u>port</u>" format
              (where <u>host</u> is the remote hostname or IPv4 address, and <u>port</u> is the remote port number).

              An  external  process-based  connection  is  defined  by the "<u>path</u> <u>args</u>" format (where <u>path</u> is the
              pathname to  an  executable  file/script,  and  any  additional  <u>args</u>  are  space-delimited);  the
              <u>/usr/share/conman/exec</u> directory contains scripts for various console types.

              A  local  Unix domain socket connection is defined by the "unix:<u>path</u>" format (where "unix:" is the
              literal character string prefix and <u>path</u> is the pathname of the local socket).

              An IPMI Serial-Over-LAN connection is defined by the "ipmi:<u>host</u>"  format  (where  "ipmi:"  is  the
              literal string and <u>host</u> is a hostname or IPv4 address).

              The '<b>%N</b>' character sequence will be replaced by the console name.

       <b>log</b> <b>=</b> "<u>file</u>"
              Specifies  the  file  where  console output is logged.  This string undergoes conversion specifier
              expansion (see <b>CONVERSION</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b>) each time the file is opened.  If an  absolute  pathname
              is not given, the file's location is relative to either <b>logdir</b> (if defined) or the current working
              directory.   Intermediate  directories  will  be  created  as  needed.  An empty log string (i.e.,
              <b>log</b>="") disables logging, overriding the <b>global</b> <b>log</b> name.

       <b>logopts</b> <b>=</b> "<u>string</u>"
              This keyword is optional (see <b>GLOBAL</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b>).

       <b>seropts</b> <b>=</b> "<u>string</u>"
              This keyword is optional (see <b>GLOBAL</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b>).

       <b>ipmiopts</b> <b>=</b> "<u>string</u>"
              This keyword is optional (see <b>GLOBAL</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b>).

</pre><h4><b>CONVERSION</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A conversion specifier is a two-character sequence beginning with a '<b>%</b>' character.  The second  character
       in the sequence specifies the type of conversion to be applied.  The following specifiers are supported:

       <b>%d</b>     The day of the month as a 2-digit number (01-31).

       <b>%D</b>     The console device basename (from the <b>dev</b> string), with leading directory components removed.

       <b>%g</b>     The  ISO  8601  week-based  year  as  a  2-digit  number  without  the  century.   See  <b>%V</b> for the
              corresponding ISO 8601 week number.

       <b>%G</b>     The ISO 8601 week-based year as a 4-digit number with the century.  See <b>%V</b> for  the  corresponding
              ISO 8601 week number.

       <b>%H</b>     The hour as a 2-digit number (00-23).

       <b>%j</b>     The day of the year as a 3-digit number (001-366).

       <b>%m</b>     The month as a 2-digit number (01-12).

       <b>%M</b>     The minute as a 2-digit number (00-59).

       <b>%N</b>     The console name (from the <b>name</b> string).

       <b>%P</b>     The daemon's process ID.

       <b>%s</b>     The number of seconds since the Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).

       <b>%S</b>     The  second  as  a  2-digit  number  (00-60).  (The range is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap
              seconds.)

       <b>%u</b>     The day of the week as a number (1-7), with Monday being 1.  See also <b>%w</b>.

       <b>%U</b>     The week number as a 2-digit number (00-53), starting with the first Sunday of  the  year  as  the
              first day of week 01; previous days in the new year are in week 00.  See also <b>%V</b> and <b>%W</b>.

       <b>%V</b>     The  ISO 8601 week number (01-53).  Weeks start on a Monday.  Week 01 is the first week where four
              or more days fall within the new year.  When the first calendar week has fewer than four days,  it
              is  counted  as  the  last week of the previous year.  See <b>%g</b> or <b>%G</b> for the corresponding ISO 8601
              week-based year.

       <b>%w</b>     The day of the week as a number (0-6), with Sunday being 0.  See also <b>%u</b>.

       <b>%W</b>     The week number as a 2-digit number (00-53), starting with the first Monday of  the  year  as  the
              first day of week 01; previous days in the new year are in week 00.  See also <b>%U</b> and <b>%V</b>.

       <b>%y</b>     The year as a 2-digit number without the century.

       <b>%Y</b>     The year as a 4-digit number with the century.

       <b>%%</b>     A single '%' character.

       The console name (<b>%N</b>) and device (<b>%D</b>) specifiers are "sanitized" in that non-printable characters and the
       forward-slash (/) character are replaced with underscores.

       Conversion  specifiers  within  console  log filenames are evaluated when the file is opened; this occurs
       when <b>conmand</b> first starts and whenever it receives a <b>SIGHUP</b>.
