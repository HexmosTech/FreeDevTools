</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ipmi/lan.conf - IPMI LAN Interface config file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/ipmi/lan.conf</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ipmi_sim</b> and <b>ipmilan</b> commands are configured using this configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>ITEMS</b></h4><pre>
       The following fields are used in many commands:

       <u>boolean</u> May be "<b>true</b>", "<b>false</b>", "<b>on</b>" or "<b>off</b>".

       <u>priv</u> An IPMI privilege level.  This may be "<b>callback</b>", "<b>user</b>", "<b>operator</b>", or "<b>admin</b>".

       <u>auth</u>  An IPMI authorization type.  This may be "<b>none</b>" for no authentication, "<b>straight</b>" for straight, in-
       the-clear password authentication, "<b>md2</b>" for use MD2 message digest authentication, or  "<b>md5</b>"  for  using
       MD5 message digest authentication.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>STRUCTURE</b></h4><pre>
       Blank lines and lines starting with `#' are ignored.

       The following commands are allowed the configuration file:

       <b>name</b> <u>"name"</u>
              Set  a  name  for the BMC.  This will control other things, like the default value of the ipmi_sim
              startup command file and the place where persistent data is stored.

       <b>user</b> <u>usernum</u> <u>enabled</u> <u>username</u> <u>password</u> <u>max-priv</u> <u>max-session</u>
              <u>usernum</u> specifies the user number for the user.  Note that user number  <b>0</b>  is  invalid,  and  user
              number  <b>1</b> is the special "anonymous" user, whose username is ignored.  This value may be up to <b>63</b>,
              the maximum possible IPMI user.  If you want anonymous access, you <b>must</b> have a user number <b>1</b><u>.</u>

              <u>enabled</u> is a boolean that specified whether the user is enabled or not.

              <u>username</u> specifies the name of the user, specified as a name.

              <u>password</u> specifies the password of the user, specified as a name.

              <u>max-priv</u> specifies the maximum privilege level allowed for the user.

              <u>max.sessions</u> specifies the maximum number of session the user may open.

       <b>startcmd</b> <u>"cmd"</u>
              specifies a command to execute when a power on is requested.   This  lets  a  virtual  machine  be
              started that can then connect back to the simulator.  The simulator does management of the process
              here,  and  the  power  on  state  of  the  process depends on if the process exists or not.  If a
              poweroff is requested, if the process is connected to a VM serial interface, a  graceful  shutdown
              is first requested.  If the process does not terminate in a specified amount of time, a SIGTERM is
              sent  to  the process.  The SIGTERM is sent immediately if there is no connection.  If the process
              doesn't go way in another specified amount of time, a SIGKILL is sent.

       <b>startnow</b>true|false
              If true, start the startcmd at the startup of the simulator.  Otherwise wait until  a  poweron  is
              issued.

       <b>poweroff_wait</b> <u>seconds</u>
              specifies  the  amount  of  time to wait for the startcmd to do a graceful shutdown on a powerdown
              request.  The simulator will send a request to the target, wait this amount of time, and then do a
              SIGTERM kill on the process.  If this is zero, a SIGTERM will not be done (nor  will  a  SIGKILL).
              Note  that if the simulator does not have a connection to the VM, the graceful shutdown is skipped
              and a SIGTERM is done immediately.  Default time is 60 seconds.

       <b>kill_wait</b> <u>seconds</u>
              specifies the amount of time to wait for SIGTERM to kill the process.  If  the  process  does  not
              terminate  in  this period of time, send a SIGKILL kill.  If this is zero, don't send the SIGKILL.
              Default time is 20 seconds.

       <b>console</b> <u>address</u> <u>port</u>
              specifies that a console port be opened at the given address and port.   You  can  telnet  to  the
              console  and execute emulation commands.  Note that this is a pretty huge security hole, it should
              only be used for debugging in a captive environment.

       <b>serial</b> <u>channel</u> <u>addr</u> <u>port</u> [<u>option</u> [<u>option</u> [...]]]
              <u>channel</u> specifies the channel number or type.  This may be <b>kcs</b>, <b>smic</b>, or  <b>bt</b>  or  it  may  be  15.
              Currently,  only  the system interface channel (channel 15) is supported for serial interfaces, if
              the others are specified it is  channel  15  and  the  given  interface  is  reported  in  channel
              configuration commands.

              <u>addr</u> specifies the IP address to listen on for connections.

              <u>port</u> specifies the port to listen on for connections.

              Valid options are:

              <u>codec</u>  <u>name</u>  specifies  which  codec  to use on the serial port.  Valid options are: <b>TerminalMode</b>,
              <b>Direct</b>, <b>RadisysAscii</b>, and <b>VM</b>.  The first three are implementations of IPMI  serial  interfaces  on
              certain  systems  and  might  be used for simulations of that system.  The <b>VM</b> is probably the most
              interesting; it is designed to be used with a virtual machine like qemu.

              <u>oem</u> <u>name</u> specified implementation of some OEM custom commands and options on the interface.  Valid
              options oare <b>PigeonPoint</b> and <b>Radisys</b>.

              <u>attn</u> <u>c1[,c2[...]]</u>  specifies a list of characters, separated by commas, to use  as  the  attention
              character  on  the  interface.  Generally the default is correct.  The characters are specified as
              decimal, octal, or hex digits in C style.

              <u>ipmb</u> <u>addr</u> specifies the IPMI address of the interface.  The default, 0x20, is usually correct, but
              when emulating ATCA systems this might be required.

       <b>sol</b> <u>device</u> <u>default_baud</u> [<u>history=size[,backupfile=filename]</u>] [<u>historyfru=frunum</u>]

              Allow a Serial Over LAN (SOL) connection to the given device.  This will be over interface  1  for
              the MC.

              <u>device</u>  is  the  full  path  to the device name.  It can also be in the form "tcp:address:port" or
              "telnet:address:port" to do connections over tcp (without or with  telnet  processing).   This  is
              useful for providing SOL access to qemu ports.

              <u>default_baud</u>  sets  the initial default baud rate to use.  This is overriden by the persistent SOL
              settings.

              <u>history</u> creates a history device on SOL interface 2.  The size is the size of  the  buffer.   Data
              from  the device is stored in the history buffer all the time.  Connecting to SOL interface 2 will
              cause the full history buffer to be dumped.  If <u>backupfile</u> is specified, then the history is  made
              persistent.   However,  it is only stored when a catchable signal or normal shutdown is done, so a
              poweroff or fatal signal will cause the data to be lost.

              <u>historyfru</u> makes the history available via the given FRU number on the MC.

              Note that if the connection fails to come up, the simulator will continue to try to connect.  This
              way you can fix UDP serial ports or qemu sessions and it will automatically reconnect.

       <b>loadlib</b> <u>"module"</u> [<u>"options"</u>]

              Load the given shared object into the program.

              <u>module</u> is the full path to the module.  It must be in quotes.

              <u>options</u> is an optional string in quotes that passes options to the module.  The  contents  of  the
              string are not specified, the module defines that.

              The module may have a number of functions that are called:

              <u>ipmi_sim_module_print_version(sys_data_t</u>  <u>*sys,</u>  <u>char</u> <u>*options)</u> is called when ipmi_sim is started
              with the version print option.  This way the versions of all loaded modules may be  printed.   The
              module should print it's version.  You must provide this function.

              <u>ipmi_sim_module_init(sys_data_t</u>  <u>*sys,</u>  <u>char</u>  <u>*options)</u>  is called after the configuration file is
              read and before any other initialization is done.  The module should do most of its initialization
              here.  You must provide this function.

              <u>ipmi_sim_module_post_init(sys_data_t</u> <u>*sys)</u> is called after  ipmi_sim  has  finished  initializing.
              This function is optional.

       <u>sys</u> parameter is used for most functions interfacing to the main ipmi_sim code, like logging, timers, and
       a few of the MC calls.  The contents are opaque to the module.

       <b>startlan</b> <u>channel</u>
              Starts a LAN configuration area.  This specifies the settings for a LAN connection using the given
              channel.   This  may  be  specified  more than once in a file to support multiple LAN connections.
              Commands following this, up to <b>endlan</b>, are LAN-specific commands listed below.  <u>channel</u>  specifies
              the channel to set the LAN configuration for.

</pre><h4><b>LAN</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following commands are only valid inside a <b>startlen</b> area.

       <b>addr</b> <u>IP-address</u> [<u>UDP-port</u>]
              <u>IP-address</u> specifies the IP address to use for an IP port. Up to 4 addresses may be specified.  If
              no  address is specified, it defaults to one port at <b>0.0.0.0</b> (for every address on the machine) at
              port <b>623</b>.

              <u>UDP-port</u> specifies an optional port to listen on. It defaults to <b>623</b> (the standard port).

       <b>PEF_alerting</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Turn PEF alerting on or off (not currently supported).

       <b>per_msg_auth</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Turn per-message authentication on or off.

       <b>priv_limit</b> <u>priv</u>
              The maximum privilege allowed on this interface.

       <b>allowed_auths_callback</b> [<u>auth</u> [<u>auth</u> [...]]]
              <u>auth</u> specifies allowed authorization levels for the callback privilege  level.   Only  the  levels
              specified  on  this  line  are  allowed for the authorization level.  If this line is not present,
              callback authorization cannot be used.

       <b>allowed_auths_user</b> [<u>auth</u> [<u>auth</u> [...]]]
              <u>auth</u> specifies allowed authorization levels  for  the  user  privilege  level.   Only  the  levels
              specified on this line are allowed for the authorization level.  If this line is not present, user
              authorization cannot be used.

       <b>allowed_auths_operator</b> [<u>auth</u> [<u>auth</u> [...]]]
              <u>auth</u>  specifies  allowed  authorization  levels for the operator privilege level.  Only the levels
              specified on this line are allowed for the authorization level.  If  this  line  is  not  present,
              operator authorization cannot be used.

       <b>allowed_auths_admin</b> [<u>auth</u> [<u>auth</u> [...]]]
              <u>auth</u>  specifies  allowed  authorization  levels  for  the  admin privilege level.  Only the levels
              specified on this line are allowed for the authorization level.  If this line is not present, user
              authorization cannot be used.

       <b>guid</b> <u>name</u>
              Allows the 16-byte GUID for the IPMI LAN connection to be specified.  If this  is  not  specified,
              then the GUID command is not supported.
