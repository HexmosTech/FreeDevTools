</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       systemd-system.conf, system.conf.d, systemd-user.conf, user.conf.d - System and session service manager
       configuration files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/etc/systemd/system.conf">/etc/systemd/system.conf</a>, /run/systemd/system.conf, /usr/lib/systemd/system.conf,
       /etc/systemd/system.conf.d/*.conf, /run/systemd/system.conf.d/*.conf,
       /usr/lib/systemd/system.conf.d/*.conf

       <a href="file:~/.config/systemd/user.conf">~/.config/systemd/user.conf</a>, <a href="file:/etc/systemd/user.conf">/etc/systemd/user.conf</a>, /run/systemd/user.conf, /usr/lib/systemd/user.conf,
       /etc/systemd/user.conf.d/*.conf, /run/systemd/user.conf.d/*.conf, /usr/lib/systemd/user.conf.d/*.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When run as a system instance, <b>systemd</b> interprets the configuration file system.conf and the files in
       system.conf.d directories; when run as a user instance, it interprets the configuration file user.conf
       (in order of priority, in the home directory of the user and under <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>, <a href="file:/run/systemd/">/run/systemd/</a>, and
       <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/">/usr/lib/systemd/</a>) and the files in user.conf.d directories. These configuration files contain a few
       settings controlling basic manager operations.

       See <b><a href="../man7/systemd.syntax.7.html">systemd.syntax</a></b>(7) for a general description of the syntax.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PRECEDENCE</b></h4><pre>
       The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary
       to deviate from those defaults. The main configuration file is loaded from one of the listed directories
       in order of priority, only the first file found is used: <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>, <a href="file:/run/systemd/">/run/systemd/</a>,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/ [1], <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/.">/usr/lib/systemd/.</a> The vendor version of the file contains commented out
       entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can also be created by
       creating drop-ins, as described below. The main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose
       (or a copy in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> if it is shipped under <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>), however using drop-ins for local configuration is
       recommended over modifications to the main configuration file.

       In addition to the main configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets are read from
       <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/">/usr/lib/systemd/</a>*.conf.d/, /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>*.conf.d/. Those drop-ins
       have higher precedence and override the main configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration
       subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the
       subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a
       single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of
       values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

       When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop-ins under <a href="file:/usr/.">/usr/.</a> Files in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>
       are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files
       installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
       configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those
       subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering. This also defines a concept
       of drop-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship drop-ins within a specific range lower than the range
       used by users. This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding accidentally drop-ins defined by
       users. It is recommended to use the range 10-40 for drop-ins in <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and the range 60-90 for drop-ins in
       <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> and <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>, to make sure that local and transient drop-ins take priority over drop-ins shipped by
       the OS vendor.

       To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
       /dev/null in the configuration directory in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>, with the same filename as the vendor configuration
       file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All options are configured in the [Manager] section:

       <u>LogColor=</u>, <u>LogLevel=</u>, <u>LogLocation=</u>, <u>LogTarget=</u>, <u>LogTime=</u>, <u>DumpCore=yes</u>, <u>CrashChangeVT=no</u>, <u>CrashShell=no</u>,
       <u>CrashAction=freeze</u>, <u>ShowStatus=yes</u>, <u>DefaultStandardOutput=journal</u>, <u>DefaultStandardError=inherit</u>
           Configures various parameters of basic manager operation. These options may be overridden by the
           respective process and kernel command line arguments. See <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) for details.

           Added in version 198.

       <u>CtrlAltDelBurstAction=</u>
           Defines what action will be performed if user presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete more than 7 times in 2s. Can be
           set to "reboot-force", "poweroff-force", "reboot-immediate", "poweroff-immediate" or disabled with
           "none". Defaults to "reboot-force".

           Added in version 232.

       <u>StatusUnitFormat=</u>
           Takes <b>name</b>, <b>description</b> or <b>combined</b> as the value. If <b>name</b>, the system manager will use unit names in
           status messages (e.g.  "systemd-journald.service"), instead of the longer and more informative
           descriptions set with <u>Description=</u> (e.g.  "Journal Logging Service"). If <b>combined</b>, the system manager
           will use both unit names and descriptions in status messages (e.g.  "systemd-journald.service -
           Journal Logging Service").

           See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5) for details about unit names and <u>Description=</u>.

           Added in version 243.

       <u>DefaultTimerAccuracySec=</u>
           Sets the default accuracy of timer units. This controls the global default for the <u>AccuracySec=</u>
           setting of timer units, see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.timer.5.html">systemd.timer</a></b>(5) for details.  <u>AccuracySec=</u> set in individual units
           override the global default for the specific unit. Defaults to 1min. Note that the accuracy of timer
           units is also affected by the configured timer slack for PID 1, see <u>TimerSlackNSec=</u> above.

           Added in version 212.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCE</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>TimerSlackNSec=</u>
           Sets the timer slack in nanoseconds for PID 1, which is inherited by all executed processes, unless
           overridden individually, for example with the <u>TimerSlackNSec=</u> setting in service units (for details
           see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5)). The timer slack controls the accuracy of wake-ups triggered by system timers.
           See <b><a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</a></b>(2) for more information. Note that in contrast to most other time span definitions this
           parameter takes an integer value in nano-seconds if no unit is specified. The usual time units are
           understood too.

           Added in version 198.

       <u>CPUAffinity=</u>
           Configures the CPU affinity for the service manager as well as the default CPU affinity for all
           forked off processes. Takes a list of CPU indices or ranges separated by either whitespace or commas.
           CPU ranges are specified by the lower and upper CPU indices separated by a dash. This option may be
           specified more than once, in which case the specified CPU affinity masks are merged. If the empty
           string is assigned, the mask is reset, all assignments prior to this will have no effect. Individual
           services may override the CPU affinity for their processes with the <u>CPUAffinity=</u> setting in unit
           files, see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5).

           Added in version 198.

       <u>NUMAPolicy=</u>
           Configures the NUMA memory policy for the service manager and the default NUMA memory policy for all
           forked off processes. Individual services may override the default policy with the <u>NUMAPolicy=</u>
           setting in unit files, see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5).

           Added in version 243.

       <u>NUMAMask=</u>
           Configures the NUMA node mask that will be associated with the selected NUMA policy. Note that
           <b>default</b> and <b>local</b> NUMA policies do not require explicit NUMA node mask and value of the option can be
           empty. Similarly to <u>NUMAPolicy=</u>, value can be overridden by individual services in unit files, see
           <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5).

           Added in version 243.

       <u>DefaultCPUAccounting=</u>, <u>DefaultMemoryAccounting=</u>, <u>DefaultTasksAccounting=</u>, <u>DefaultIOAccounting=</u>,
       <u>DefaultIPAccounting=</u>
           Configure the default resource accounting settings, as configured per-unit by <u>CPUAccounting=</u>,
           <u>MemoryAccounting=</u>, <u>TasksAccounting=</u>, <u>IOAccounting=</u> and <u>IPAccounting=</u>. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5)
           for details on the per-unit settings.

           <u>DefaultCPUAccounting=</u> defaults to yes when running on kernel ≥4.15, and no on older versions.
           <u>DefaultMemoryAccounting=</u> defaults to yes.  <u>DefaultTasksAccounting=</u> defaults to yes. The other
           settings default to no.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>DefaultTasksMax=</u>
           Configure the default value for the per-unit <u>TasksMax=</u> setting. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5) for
           details. This setting applies to all unit types that support resource control settings, with the
           exception of slice units. Defaults to 15% of the minimum of <u>kernel.pid_max=</u>, <u>kernel.threads-max=</u> and
           root cgroup <u>pids.max</u>. Kernel has a default value for <u>kernel.pid_max=</u> and an algorithm of counting in
           case of more than 32 cores. For example, with the default <u>kernel.pid_max=</u>, <u>DefaultTasksMax=</u> defaults
           to 4915, but might be greater in other systems or smaller in OS containers.

           Added in version 228.

       <u>DefaultLimitCPU=</u>, <u>DefaultLimitFSIZE=</u>, <u>DefaultLimitDATA=</u>, <u>DefaultLimitSTACK=</u>, <u>DefaultLimitCORE=</u>,
       <u>DefaultLimitRSS=</u>, <u>DefaultLimitNOFILE=</u>, <u>DefaultLimitAS=</u>, <u>DefaultLimitNPROC=</u>, <u>DefaultLimitMEMLOCK=</u>,
       <u>DefaultLimitLOCKS=</u>, <u>DefaultLimitSIGPENDING=</u>, <u>DefaultLimitMSGQUEUE=</u>, <u>DefaultLimitNICE=</u>,
       <u>DefaultLimitRTPRIO=</u>, <u>DefaultLimitRTTIME=</u>
           These settings control various default resource limits for processes executed by units. See
           <b><a href="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</a></b>(2) for details. These settings may be overridden in individual units using the
           corresponding <u>LimitXXX=</u> directives and they accept the same parameter syntax, see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5) for
           details. Note that these resource limits are only defaults for units, they are not applied to the
           service manager process (i.e. PID 1) itself.

           Most of these settings are unset, which means the resource limits are inherited from the kernel or,
           if invoked in a container, from the container manager. However, the following have defaults:

           •   <u>DefaultLimitNOFILE=</u> defaults to 1024:524288.

           •   <u>DefaultLimitMEMLOCK=</u> defaults to 8M.

           •   <u>DefaultLimitCORE=</u> does not have a default but it is worth mentioning that <u>RLIMIT_CORE</u> is set to
               "infinity" by PID 1 which is inherited by its children.

           Note that the service manager internally in PID 1 bumps <u>RLIMIT_NOFILE</u> and <u>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</u> to higher
           values, however the limit is reverted to the mentioned defaults for all child processes forked off.

           Added in version 198.

       <u>DefaultOOMPolicy=</u>
           Configure the default policy for reacting to processes being killed by the Linux Out-Of-Memory (OOM)
           killer or <b>systemd-oomd</b>. This may be used to pick a global default for the per-unit <u>OOMPolicy=</u>
           setting. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service</a></b>(5) for details. Note that this default is not used for services that
           have <u>Delegate=</u> turned on.

           Added in version 243.

       <u>DefaultOOMScoreAdjust=</u>
           Configures the default OOM score adjustments of processes run by the service manager. This defaults
           to unset (meaning the forked off processes inherit the service manager's OOM score adjustment value),
           except if the service manager is run for an unprivileged user, in which case this defaults to the
           service manager's OOM adjustment value plus 100 (this makes service processes slightly more likely to
           be killed under memory pressure than the manager itself). This may be used to pick a global default
           for the per-unit <u>OOMScoreAdjust=</u> setting. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5) for details. Note that this setting has
           no effect on the OOM score adjustment value of the service manager process itself, it retains the
           original value set during its invocation.

           Added in version 250.

       <u>DefaultMemoryPressureWatch=</u>, <u>DefaultMemoryPressureThresholdSec=</u>
           Configures the default settings for the per-unit <u>MemoryPressureWatch=</u> and <u>MemoryPressureThresholdSec=</u>
           settings. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5) for details. Defaults to "auto" and "200ms", respectively.
           This also sets the memory pressure monitoring threshold for the service manager itself.

           Added in version 254.

</pre><h4><b>HARDWARE</b> <b>WATCHDOG</b></h4><pre>
       <u>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</u>, <u>RebootWatchdogSec=</u>, <u>KExecWatchdogSec=</u>
           Configure the hardware watchdog at runtime and at reboot. Takes a timeout value in seconds (or in
           other time units if suffixed with "ms", "min", "h", "d", "w"), or the special strings "off" or
           "default". If set to "off" (alternatively: "0") the watchdog logic is disabled: no watchdog device is
           opened, configured, or pinged. If set to the special string "default" the watchdog is opened and
           pinged in regular intervals, but the timeout is not changed from the default. If set to any other
           time value the watchdog timeout is configured to the specified value (or a value close to it,
           depending on hardware capabilities).

           If <u>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</u> is set to a non-zero value, the watchdog hardware (/dev/watchdog0 or the path
           specified with <u>WatchdogDevice=</u> or the kernel option <u>systemd.watchdog_device=</u>) will be programmed to
           automatically reboot the system if it is not contacted within the specified timeout interval. The
           system manager will ensure to contact it at least once in half the specified timeout interval. This
           feature requires a hardware watchdog device to be present, as it is commonly the case in embedded and
           server systems. Not all hardware watchdogs allow configuration of all possible reboot timeout values,
           in which case the closest available timeout is picked.

           <u>RebootWatchdogSec=</u> may be used to configure the hardware watchdog when the system is asked to reboot.
           It works as a safety net to ensure that the reboot takes place even if a clean reboot attempt times
           out. Note that the <u>RebootWatchdogSec=</u> timeout applies only to the second phase of the reboot, i.e.
           after all regular services are already terminated, and after the system and service manager process
           (PID 1) got replaced by the systemd-shutdown binary, see system <b><a href="../man7/bootup.7.html">bootup</a></b>(7) for details. During the
           first phase of the shutdown operation the system and service manager remains running and hence
           <u>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</u> is still honoured. In order to define a timeout on this first phase of system
           shutdown, configure <u>JobTimeoutSec=</u> and <u>JobTimeoutAction=</u> in the [Unit] section of the shutdown.target
           unit. By default, <u>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</u> defaults to 0 (off), and <u>RebootWatchdogSec=</u> to 10min.

           <u>KExecWatchdogSec=</u> may be used to additionally enable the watchdog when kexec is being executed rather
           than when rebooting. Note that if the kernel does not reset the watchdog on kexec (depending on the
           specific hardware and/or driver), in this case the watchdog might not get disabled after kexec
           succeeds and thus the system might get rebooted, unless <u>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</u> is also enabled at the
           same time. For this reason it is recommended to enable <u>KExecWatchdogSec=</u> only if <u>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</u>
           is also enabled.

           These settings have no effect if a hardware watchdog is not available.

           Added in version 198.

       <u>RuntimeWatchdogPreSec=</u>
           Configure the hardware watchdog device pre-timeout value. Takes a timeout value in seconds (or in
           other time units similar to <u>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</u>). A watchdog pre-timeout is a notification generated
           by the watchdog before the watchdog reset might occur in the event the watchdog has not been
           serviced. This notification is handled by the kernel and can be configured to take an action (i.e.
           generate a kernel panic) using <u>RuntimeWatchdogPreGovernor=</u>. Not all watchdog hardware or drivers
           support generating a pre-timeout and depending on the state of the system, the kernel may be unable
           to take the configured action before the watchdog reboot. The watchdog will be configured to generate
           the pre-timeout event at the amount of time specified by <u>RuntimeWatchdogPreSec=</u> before the runtime
           watchdog timeout (set by <u>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</u>). For example, if the we have <u>RuntimeWatchdogSec=30</u> and
           <u>RuntimeWatchdogPreSec=10</u>, then the pre-timeout event will occur if the watchdog has not pinged for
           20s (10s before the watchdog would fire). By default, <u>RuntimeWatchdogPreSec=</u> defaults to 0 (off). The
           value set for <u>RuntimeWatchdogPreSec=</u> must be smaller than the timeout value for <u>RuntimeWatchdogSec=</u>.
           This setting has no effect if a hardware watchdog is not available or the hardware watchdog does not
           support a pre-timeout and will be ignored by the kernel if the setting is greater than the actual
           watchdog timeout.

           Added in version 251.

       <u>RuntimeWatchdogPreGovernor=</u>
           Configure the action taken by the hardware watchdog device when the pre-timeout expires. The default
           action for the pre-timeout event depends on the kernel configuration, but it is usually to log a
           kernel message. For a list of valid actions available for a given watchdog device, check the content
           of the /sys/class/watchdog/watchdog<u>X</u>/pretimeout_available_governors file. Typically, available
           governor types are <u>noop</u> and <u>panic</u>. Availability, names and functionality might vary depending on the
           specific device driver in use. If the pretimeout_available_governors sysfs file is empty, the
           governor might be built as a kernel module and might need to be manually loaded (e.g.
           <u>pretimeout_noop.ko</u>), or the watchdog device might not support pre-timeouts.

           Added in version 251.

       <u>WatchdogDevice=</u>
           Configure the hardware watchdog device that the runtime and shutdown watchdog timers will open and
           use. Defaults to /dev/watchdog0. This setting has no effect if a hardware watchdog is not available.

           Added in version 236.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       <u>CapabilityBoundingSet=</u>
           Controls which capabilities to include in the capability bounding set for PID 1 and its children. See
           <b><a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</a></b>(7) for details. Takes a whitespace-separated list of capability names as read by
           <b><a href="../man3/cap_from_name.3.html">cap_from_name</a></b>(3). Capabilities listed will be included in the bounding set, all others are removed.
           If the list of capabilities is prefixed with ~, all but the listed capabilities will be included, the
           effect of the assignment inverted. Note that this option also affects the respective capabilities in
           the effective, permitted and inheritable capability sets. The capability bounding set may also be
           individually configured for units using the <u>CapabilityBoundingSet=</u> directive for units, but note that
           capabilities dropped for PID 1 cannot be regained in individual units, they are lost for good.

           Added in version 198.

       <u>NoNewPrivileges=</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. If true, ensures that PID 1 and all its children can never gain new
           privileges through <b><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></b>(2) (e.g. via setuid or setgid bits, or filesystem capabilities). Defaults
           to false. General purpose distributions commonly rely on executables with setuid or setgid bits and
           will thus not function properly with this option enabled. Individual units cannot disable this
           option. Also see <b>No</b> <b>New</b> <b>Privileges</b> <b>Flag</b>[2].

           Added in version 239.

       <u>ProtectSystem=</u>
           Takes a boolean argument or the string "auto". If set to true this will remount <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> read-only. If
           set to "auto" (the default) and running in an initrd equivalent to true, otherwise false. This
           implements a restricted subset of the per-unit setting of the same name, see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5) for
           details: currently, the "full" or "strict" values are not supported.

           Added in version 256.

       <u>SystemCallArchitectures=</u>
           Takes a space-separated list of architecture identifiers. Selects from which architectures system
           calls may be invoked on this system. This may be used as an effective way to disable invocation of
           non-native binaries system-wide, for example to prohibit execution of 32-bit x86 binaries on 64-bit
           x86-64 systems. This option operates system-wide, and acts similar to the <u>SystemCallArchitectures=</u>
           setting of unit files, see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5) for details. This setting defaults to the empty list, in
           which case no filtering of system calls based on architecture is applied. Known architecture
           identifiers are "x86", "x86-64", "x32", "arm" and the special identifier "native". The latter
           implicitly maps to the native architecture of the system (or more specifically, the architecture the
           system manager was compiled for). Set this setting to "native" to prohibit execution of any
           non-native binaries. When a binary executes a system call of an architecture that is not listed in
           this setting, it will be immediately terminated with the SIGSYS signal.

           Added in version 209.

       <u>DefaultSmackProcessLabel=</u>
           Takes a <b>SMACK64</b> security label as the argument. The process executed by a unit will be started under
           this label if <u>SmackProcessLabel=</u> is not set in the unit. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5) for the details.

           If the value is "/", only labels specified with <u>SmackProcessLabel=</u> are assigned and the compile-time
           default is ignored.

           Added in version 252.

</pre><h4><b>TIMEOUTS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>RATE</b> <b>LIMITS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>DefaultTimeoutStartSec=</u>, <u>DefaultTimeoutStopSec=</u>, <u>DefaultTimeoutAbortSec=</u>, <u>DefaultRestartSec=</u>
           Configures the default timeouts for starting, stopping and aborting of units, as well as the default
           time to sleep between automatic restarts of units, as configured per-unit in <u>TimeoutStartSec=</u>,
           <u>TimeoutStopSec=</u>, <u>TimeoutAbortSec=</u> and <u>RestartSec=</u> (for services, see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service</a></b>(5) for details
           on the per-unit settings). For non-service units, <u>DefaultTimeoutStartSec=</u> sets the default
           <u>TimeoutSec=</u> value.

           <u>DefaultTimeoutStartSec=</u> and <u>DefaultTimeoutStopSec=</u> default to 90 s in the system manager and 90 s in
           the user manager.  <u>DefaultTimeoutAbortSec=</u> is not set by default so that all units fall back to
           <u>TimeoutStopSec=</u>.  <u>DefaultRestartSec=</u> defaults to 100 ms.

           Added in version 209.

       <u>DefaultDeviceTimeoutSec=</u>
           Configures the default timeout for waiting for devices. It can be changed per device via the
           <u>x-systemd.device-timeout=</u> option in <a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a> and <a href="file:/etc/crypttab">/etc/crypttab</a> (see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.mount.5.html">systemd.mount</a></b>(5), <b><a href="../man5/crypttab.5.html">crypttab</a></b>(5)).
           Defaults to 90 s in the system manager and 90 s in the user manager.

           Added in version 252.

       <u>DefaultStartLimitIntervalSec=</u>, <u>DefaultStartLimitBurst=</u>
           Configure the default unit start rate limiting, as configured per-service by <u>StartLimitIntervalSec=</u>
           and <u>StartLimitBurst=</u>. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service</a></b>(5) for details on the per-service settings.
           <u>DefaultStartLimitIntervalSec=</u> defaults to 10s.  <u>DefaultStartLimitBurst=</u> defaults to 5.

           Added in version 209.

       <u>ReloadLimitIntervalSec=</u>, <u>ReloadLimitBurst=</u>
           Rate limiting for daemon-reload and (since v256) daemon-reexec requests. The setting applies to both
           operations, but the rate limits are tracked separately. Defaults to unset, and any number of
           operations can be requested at any time.  <u>ReloadLimitIntervalSec=</u> takes a value in seconds to
           configure the rate limit window, and <u>ReloadLimitBurst=</u> takes a positive integer to configure the
           maximum allowed number of operations within the configured time window.

           Added in version 253.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>ManagerEnvironment=</u>
           Takes the same arguments as <u>DefaultEnvironment=</u>, see above. Sets environment variables for the
           manager process itself. These variables are inherited by processes spawned by user managers, but not
           the system manager - use <u>DefaultEnvironment=</u> for that. Note that these variables are merged into the
           existing environment block. In particular, in case of the system manager, this includes variables set
           by the kernel based on the kernel command line. As with <u>DefaultEnvironment=</u>, this environment block
           is internal, and changes are not reflected in the manager's /proc/PID/environ.

           Setting environment variables for the manager process may be useful to modify its behaviour. See
           <b>Known</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Variables</b>[3] for a descriptions of some variables understood by <b>systemd</b>.

           Simple "%"-specifier expansion is supported, see below for a list of supported specifiers.

           Added in version 248.

       <u>DefaultEnvironment=</u>
           Configures environment variables passed to all executed processes. Takes a space-separated list of
           variable assignments. See <b><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></b>(7) for details about environment variables.

           Simple "%"-specifier expansion is supported, see below for a list of supported specifiers.

           Example:

               DefaultEnvironment="VAR1=word1 word2" VAR2=word3 "VAR3=word 5 6"

           Sets three variables "VAR1", "VAR2", "VAR3".

           Added in version 205.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFIERS</b></h4><pre>
       Specifiers may be used in the <u>DefaultEnvironment=</u> and <u>ManagerEnvironment=</u> settings. The following
       expansions are understood:
