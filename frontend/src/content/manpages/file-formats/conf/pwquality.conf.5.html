</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pwquality.conf - configuration for the libpwquality library

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</u>

       <u>/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pwquality.conf</b> provides a way to configure the default password quality requirements for the system
       passwords. This file is read by the libpwquality library and utilities that use this library for checking
       and generating passwords.

       The file has a very simple <u>name</u> <u>=</u> <u>value</u> format with possible comments starting with "#" character. The
       whitespace at the beginning of line, end of line, and around the "=" sign is ignored.

       The libpwquality library also first reads all <u>*.conf</u> files from the <u>/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d</u>
       directory in ASCII sorted order. The values of the same settings are overridden in the order the files
       are parsed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The possible options in the file are:

       <b>difok</b>
           Number of characters in the new password that must not be present in the old password. (default 1)

           The  special  value  of 0 disables all checks of similarity of the new password with the old password
           except the new password being exactly the same as the old one.

       <b>minlen</b>
           Minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if credits  are  not  disabled  which  is  the
           default). (See <b><a href="../man8/pam_pwquality.8.html">pam_pwquality</a></b>(8).)  Cannot be set to lower value than 6. (default 8)

       <b>dcredit</b>
           The  maximum credit for having digits in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of
           digits in the new password. (default 0)

       <b>ucredit</b>
           The maximum credit for having uppercase characters in the new password.  If less than  0  it  is  the
           minimum number of uppercase characters in the new password. (default 0)

       <b>lcredit</b>
           The  maximum  credit  for  having lowercase characters in the new password.  If less than 0 it is the
           minimum number of lowercase characters in the new password. (default 0)

       <b>ocredit</b>
           The maximum credit for having other characters in the new password.  If less than 0 it is the minimum
           number of other characters in the new password. (default 0)

       <b>minclass</b>
           The minimum number of required classes  of  characters  for  the  new  password  (digits,  uppercase,
           lowercase, others). (default 0)

       <b>maxrepeat</b>
           The maximum number of allowed same consecutive characters in the new password.  The check is disabled
           if the value is 0. (default 0)

       <b>maxsequence</b>
           The  maximum  length of monotonic character sequences in the new password.  Examples of such sequence
           are '12345' or 'fedcb'. Note that most such passwords will not pass the simplicity check  unless  the
           sequence is only a minor part of the password.  The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0)

       <b>maxclassrepeat</b>
           The  maximum  number  of  allowed  consecutive characters of the same class in the new password.  The
           check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0)

       <b>gecoscheck</b>
           If nonzero, check whether the words longer than 3 characters from  the  <u>GECOS</u>  field  of  the  user's
           <b><a href="../man5/passwd.5.html">passwd</a></b>(5) entry are contained in the new password.  The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default
           0)

       <b>dictcheck</b>
           If  nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications) matches a word in a dictionary.
           Currently the dictionary check is performed using the cracklib library. (default 1)

       <b>usercheck=</b><u>N</u>
           If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications) contains the user name  in  some
           form. It is not performed for user names shorter than 3 characters. (default 1)

       <b>usersubstr=</b><u>N</u>
           If  greater  than  3  (due to the minimum length in usercheck), check whether the password contains a
           substring of at least <u>N</u> length in some form.  (default 0)

       <b>enforcing=</b><u>N</u>
           If nonzero, reject the password if it fails the  checks,  otherwise  only  print  the  warning.  This
           setting  applies  only  to  the  pam_pwquality module and possibly other applications that explicitly
           change their behavior based on it. It does not affect <b><a href="../man1/pwmake.1.html">pwmake</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/pwscore.1.html">pwscore</a></b>(1). (default 1)

       <b>badwords</b>
           Space separated list of words that must not be contained in the password. These are additional  words
           to  the cracklib dictionary check. This setting can be also used by applications to emulate the gecos
           check for user accounts that are not created yet.

       <b>dictpath</b>
           Path to the cracklib dictionaries. Default is to use the cracklib default.

       <b>retry=</b><u>N</u>
           Prompt user at most <u>N</u> times before returning with error. The default is <u>1</u>.

       <b>enforce_for_root</b>
           The module will return error on failed check even if the user changing the  password  is  root.  This
           option is off by default which means that just the message about the failed check is printed but root
           can  change  the  password anyway. Note that root is not asked for an old password so the checks that
           compare the old and new password are not performed.

       <b>local_users_only</b>
           The module will not test the password quality for users that are not present in the <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u> file.
           The module still asks for the password so the following modules in the stack can use the  <b>use_authtok</b>
           option.  This option is off by default.
