</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       homed.conf, homed.conf.d - Home area/user account manager configuration files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           /etc/systemd/homed.conf
           /run/systemd/homed.conf
           /usr/local/lib/systemd/homed.conf
           /usr/lib/systemd/homed.conf
           /etc/systemd/homed.conf.d/*.conf
           /run/systemd/homed.conf.d/*.conf
           /usr/local/lib/systemd/homed.conf.d/*.conf
           /usr/lib/systemd/homed.conf.d/*.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These configuration files control default parameters for home areas/user accounts created and managed by
       <b><a href="../man8/systemd-homed.service.8.html">systemd-homed.service</a></b>(8).

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PRECEDENCE</b></h4><pre>
       The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary
       to deviate from those defaults. The main configuration file is loaded from one of the listed directories
       in order of priority, only the first file found is used: <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>, <a href="file:/run/systemd/">/run/systemd/</a>,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/ [1], <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/.">/usr/lib/systemd/.</a> The vendor version of the file contains commented out
       entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can also be created by
       creating drop-ins, as described below. The main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose
       (or a copy in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> if it is shipped under <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>), however using drop-ins for local configuration is
       recommended over modifications to the main configuration file.

       In addition to the main configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets are read from
       <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/">/usr/lib/systemd/</a>*.conf.d/, /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>*.conf.d/. Those drop-ins
       have higher precedence and override the main configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration
       subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the
       subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a
       single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of
       values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

       When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop-ins under <a href="file:/usr/.">/usr/.</a> Files in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>
       are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files
       installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
       configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those
       subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering. This also defines a concept
       of drop-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship drop-ins within a specific range lower than the range
       used by users. This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding accidentally drop-ins defined by
       users. It is recommended to use the range 10-40 for drop-ins in <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and the range 60-90 for drop-ins in
       <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> and <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>, to make sure that local and transient drop-ins take priority over drop-ins shipped by
       the OS vendor.

       To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
       /dev/null in the configuration directory in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>, with the same filename as the vendor configuration
       file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are available in the [Home] section:

       <u>DefaultStorage=</u>
           The default storage to use for home areas. Takes one of "luks", "fscrypt", "directory", "subvolume",
           "cifs". For details about these options, see <b><a href="../man1/homectl.1.html">homectl</a></b>(1). If not configured or assigned the empty
           string, the default storage is automatically determined: if not running in a container environment
           and <a href="file:/home/">/home/</a> is not itself encrypted, defaults to "luks". Otherwise, defaults to "subvolume" if <a href="file:/home/">/home/</a>
           is on a btrfs file system, and "directory" otherwise. Note that the storage selected on the <b>homectl</b>
           command line always takes precedence.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>DefaultFileSystemType=</u>
           When using "luks" as storage (see above), selects the default file system to use inside the user's
           LUKS volume. Takes one of "btrfs", "ext4" or "xfs". If not specified, defaults to "btrfs". This
           setting has no effect if a different storage mechanism is used. The file system type selected on the
           <b>homectl</b> command line always takes precedence.

           Added in version 246.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
        1. ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ðŸ§¨ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’£  Please  note  that  those  configuration  files  must  be  available  at  all times. If
           <a href="file:/usr/local/">/usr/local/</a> is a separate partition, it may not be available during early boot, and must not be  used
           for configuration.
