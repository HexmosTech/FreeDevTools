</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       journal-remote.conf, journal-remote.conf.d - Configuration files for the service accepting remote journal
       uploads

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           /etc/systemd/journal-remote.conf
           /run/systemd/journal-remote.conf
           /usr/local/lib/systemd/journal-remote.conf
           /usr/lib/systemd/journal-remote.conf
           /etc/systemd/journal-remote.conf.d/*.conf
           /run/systemd/journal-remote.conf.d/*.conf
           /usr/local/lib/systemd/journal-remote.conf.d/*.conf
           /usr/lib/systemd/journal-remote.conf.d/*.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These files configure various parameters of <b><a href="../man8/systemd-journal-remote.service.8.html">systemd-journal-remote.service</a></b>(8). See <b><a href="../man7/systemd.syntax.7.html">systemd.syntax</a></b>(7) for
       a general description of the syntax.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PRECEDENCE</b></h4><pre>
       The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary
       to deviate from those defaults. The main configuration file is loaded from one of the listed directories
       in order of priority, only the first file found is used: <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>, <a href="file:/run/systemd/">/run/systemd/</a>,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/ [1], <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/.">/usr/lib/systemd/.</a> The vendor version of the file contains commented out
       entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can also be created by
       creating drop-ins, as described below. The main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose
       (or a copy in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> if it is shipped under <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>), however using drop-ins for local configuration is
       recommended over modifications to the main configuration file.

       In addition to the main configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets are read from
       <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/">/usr/lib/systemd/</a>*.conf.d/, /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>*.conf.d/. Those drop-ins
       have higher precedence and override the main configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration
       subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the
       subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a
       single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of
       values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

       When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop-ins under <a href="file:/usr/.">/usr/.</a> Files in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>
       are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files
       installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
       configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those
       subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering. This also defines a concept
       of drop-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship drop-ins within a specific range lower than the range
       used by users. This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding accidentally drop-ins defined by
       users. It is recommended to use the range 10-40 for drop-ins in <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and the range 60-90 for drop-ins in
       <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> and <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>, to make sure that local and transient drop-ins take priority over drop-ins shipped by
       the OS vendor.

       To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
       /dev/null in the configuration directory in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>, with the same filename as the vendor configuration
       file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All options are configured in the [Remote] section:

       <u>Seal=</u>
           Periodically sign the data in the journal using Forward Secure Sealing.

           Added in version 229.

       <u>SplitMode=</u>
           One of "host" or "none".

           Added in version 220.

       <u>ServerKeyFile=</u>
           SSL key in PEM format.

           Added in version 220.

       <u>ServerCertificateFile=</u>
           SSL certificate in PEM format.

           Added in version 220.

       <u>TrustedCertificateFile=</u>
           SSL CA certificate.

           Added in version 220.

       <u>MaxUse=</u>, <u>KeepFree=</u>, <u>MaxFileSize=</u>, <u>MaxFiles=</u>
           These are analogous to <u>SystemMaxUse=</u>, <u>SystemKeepFree=</u>, <u>SystemMaxFileSize=</u> and <u>SystemMaxFiles=</u> in
           <b><a href="../man5/journald.conf.5.html">journald.conf</a></b>(5).

           <u>MaxUse=</u> controls how much disk space the <b>systemd-journal-remote</b> may use up at most.  <u>KeepFree=</u>
           controls how much disk space <b>systemd-journal-remote</b> shall leave free for other uses.
           <b>systemd-journal-remote</b> will respect both limits and use the smaller of the two values.

           <u>MaxFiles=</u> controls how many individual journal files to keep at most. Note that only archived files
           are deleted to reduce the number of files until this limit is reached; active files will stay around.
           This means that, in effect, there might still be more journal files around in total than this limit
           after a vacuuming operation is complete.

           Added in version 253.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
        1. ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ðŸ§¨ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’£  Please  note  that  those  configuration  files  must  be  available  at  all times. If
           <a href="file:/usr/local/">/usr/local/</a> is a separate partition, it may not be available during early boot, and must not be  used
           for configuration.
