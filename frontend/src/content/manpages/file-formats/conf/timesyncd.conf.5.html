</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       timesyncd.conf, timesyncd.conf.d - Network Time Synchronization configuration files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           <a href="file:/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf">/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf</a>
           /run/systemd/timesyncd.conf
           /usr/local/lib/systemd/timesyncd.conf
           /usr/lib/systemd/timesyncd.conf
           /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/*.conf
           /run/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/*.conf
           /usr/local/lib/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/*.conf
           /usr/lib/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/*.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These configuration files control NTP network time synchronization. See <b><a href="../man7/systemd.syntax.7.html">systemd.syntax</a></b>(7) for a general
       description of the syntax.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PRECEDENCE</b></h4><pre>
       The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary
       to deviate from those defaults. The main configuration file is loaded from one of the listed directories
       in order of priority, only the first file found is used: <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>, <a href="file:/run/systemd/">/run/systemd/</a>,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/ [1], <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/.">/usr/lib/systemd/.</a> The vendor version of the file contains commented out
       entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can also be created by
       creating drop-ins, as described below. The main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose
       (or a copy in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> if it is shipped under <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>), however using drop-ins for local configuration is
       recommended over modifications to the main configuration file.

       In addition to the main configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets are read from
       <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/">/usr/lib/systemd/</a>*.conf.d/, /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>*.conf.d/. Those drop-ins
       have higher precedence and override the main configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration
       subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the
       subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a
       single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of
       values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

       When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop-ins under <a href="file:/usr/.">/usr/.</a> Files in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>
       are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files
       installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
       configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those
       subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering. This also defines a concept
       of drop-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship drop-ins within a specific range lower than the range
       used by users. This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding accidentally drop-ins defined by
       users. It is recommended to use the range 10-40 for drop-ins in <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and the range 60-90 for drop-ins in
       <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> and <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>, to make sure that local and transient drop-ins take priority over drop-ins shipped by
       the OS vendor.

       To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
       /dev/null in the configuration directory in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>, with the same filename as the vendor configuration
       file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following settings are configured in the [Time] section:

       <u>NTP=</u>
           A space-separated list of NTP server host names or IP addresses. During runtime this list is combined
           with any per-interface NTP servers acquired from <b><a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service</a></b>(8).  <b>systemd-timesyncd</b> will
           contact all configured system or per-interface servers in turn, until one responds. When the empty
           string is assigned, the list of NTP servers is reset, and all prior assignments will have no effect.
           This setting defaults to an empty list.

           Added in version 216.

       <u>FallbackNTP=</u>
           A space-separated list of NTP server host names or IP addresses to be used as the fallback NTP
           servers. Any per-interface NTP servers obtained from <b><a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service</a></b>(8) take precedence over
           this setting, as do any servers set via <u>NTP=</u> above. This setting is hence only relevant if no other
           NTP server information is known. When the empty string is assigned, the list of NTP servers is reset,
           and all prior assignments will have no effect. If this option is not given, a compiled-in list of NTP
           servers is used.

           Added in version 216.

       <u>RootDistanceMaxSec=</u>
           Maximum acceptable root distance, i.e. the maximum estimated time required for a packet to travel to
           the server we are connected to from the server with the reference clock. If the current server does
           not satisfy this limit, <b>systemd-timesyncd</b> will switch to a different server.

           Takes a time span value. The default unit is seconds, but other units may be specified, see
           <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7). Defaults to 5 seconds.

           Added in version 236.

       <u>PollIntervalMinSec=</u>, <u>PollIntervalMaxSec=</u>
           The minimum and maximum poll intervals for NTP messages. Polling starts at the minimum poll interval,
           and is adjusted within the specified limits in response to received packets.

           Each setting takes a time span value. The default unit is seconds, but other units may be specified,
           see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7).  <u>PollIntervalMinSec=</u> defaults to 32 seconds and must not be smaller than
           16 seconds.  <u>PollIntervalMaxSec=</u> defaults to 34 min 8 s (2048 seconds) and must be larger than
           <u>PollIntervalMinSec=</u>.

           Added in version 236.

       <u>ConnectionRetrySec=</u>
           Specifies the minimum delay before subsequent attempts to contact a new NTP server are made.

           Takes a time span value. The default unit is seconds, but other units may be specified, see
           <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7). Defaults to 30 seconds and must not be smaller than 1 second.

           Added in version 248.

       <u>SaveIntervalSec=</u>
           The interval at which the current time is periodically saved to disk, in the absence of any recent
           synchronisation from an NTP server. This is especially useful for offline systems with no local RTC,
           as it will guarantee that the system clock remains roughly monotonic across reboots.

           Takes a time interval value. The default unit is seconds, but other units may be specified, see
           <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7). Defaults to 60 seconds.

           Added in version 250.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
        1. ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ðŸ§¨ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’£  Please  note  that  those  configuration  files  must  be  available  at  all times. If
           <a href="file:/usr/local/">/usr/local/</a> is a separate partition, it may not be available during early boot, and must not be  used
           for configuration.
