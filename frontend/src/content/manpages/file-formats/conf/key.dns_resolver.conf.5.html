</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       key.dns_resolver.conf - Kernel DNS resolver config

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This file is used by the <a href="../man5/key.dns_resolver.5.html">key.dns_resolver</a>(5) program to set parameters.  Unless otherwise overridden with
       the <b>-c</b> flag, the program reads:

              /etc/key.dns_resolver.conf

       Configuration  options are given in <b>key[=value]</b> form, where <b>value</b> is optional.  If present, the value may
       be surrounded by a pair of single ('') or double quotes ("") which will be  stripped  off.   The  special
       characters in the value may be escaped with a backslash to turn them into ordinary characters.

       Lines  beginning  with  a  '#'  are considered comments and ignored.  A '#' symbol anywhere after the '='
       makes the rest of the line into a comment unless the '#' is inside a quoted section or is escaped.

       Leading and trailing spaces and spaces around the '=' symbol will be stripped off.

       Available options include:

       <b>default_ttl=&lt;number&gt;</b>
              The number of seconds to set as the expiration on a cached record.  This will be overridden if the
              program manages to retrieve TTL information along with the addresses (if, for example, it accesses
              the DNS directly).  The default is 5 seconds.  The value must be in the range 1 to INT_MAX.

       The file can also include comments beginning with a '#' character unless otherwise  suppressed  by  being
       inside a quoted value or being escaped with a backslash.
