</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       snmp.conf - configuration files for the Net-SNMP applications

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Applications  built using the Net-SNMP libraries typically use one or more configuration files to control
       various aspects of their operation.  These files (<b>snmp.conf</b> and <b>snmp.local.conf</b>) can be located in one of
       several locations, as described in the <u><a href="../man5/snmp_config.5.html">snmp_config</a>(5)</u> manual page.

       In particular, /etc/snmp/snmp.conf is a common file, containing the settings shared by all users  of  the
       system.  <a href="file:~/.snmp/snmp.conf">~/.snmp/snmp.conf</a> is a personal file, with the settings specific to a particular user.

</pre><h4><b>HOST-SPECIFIC</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Host-specific  files  may  also  be loaded and will be searched for if a transport name is specified that
       matches a <u>PATH/hosts/HOST.conf</u> file.  For example, if you wanted a particular  host  to  use  SNMPv2c  by
       default you could create a <a href="file:~/.snmp/hosts/NAME.conf">~/.snmp/hosts/NAME.conf</a> file and in it put:

              defVersion 2c

       Any connections set to connect to the hostname <u>NAME</u> will use SNMPv2c.  Also see the <u>transport</u> token below
       for additional host-specific examples.

       Host-specific  configuration  files  are  loaded  at  the  time  the  connection is opened.  Thus they're
       generally loaded after all other configuration files and can  be  used  to  override  settings  from  the
       generic files.

       To avoid loading any host-specific config files set "dontLoadHostConfig true" in your snmp.conf file.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All of the tokens described in this file can be used on the command line of Net-SNMP applications as well
       by  prefixing  them with "--".  EG, specifying <u>--dontLoadHostConfig=true</u> on the command line will turn of
       loading of the host specific configuration files.

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTANT</b> <b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       Several of these directives may contain sensitive information  (such  as  pass  phrases).   Configuration
       files that include such settings should only be readable by the user concerned.

       As  well  as  application-specific  configuration  tokens,  there  are  several directives that relate to
       standard library behaviour, relevant to most Net-SNMP applications.  Many of these correspond to standard
       command-line options, which are described in the <u><a href="../man1/snmpcmd.1.html">snmpcmd</a>(1)</u> manual page.

       These directives can be divided into several distinct groups.

</pre><h4><b>CLIENT</b> <b>BEHAVIOUR</b></h4><pre>
       defDomain application domain
              The transport domain that should be used for a certain application type unless something  else  is
              specified.

       defTarget application domain target
              The  target  that should be used for connections to a certain application if the connection should
              be in a specific domain.

       defaultPort PORT
              defines the default UDP port that client SNMP applications will attempt to connect to.   This  can
              be  overridden  by  explicitly  including  a  port  number  in  the  <u>AGENT</u> specification.  See the
              <u><a href="../man1/snmpcmd.1.html">snmpcmd</a>(1)</u> manual page for more details.

              If not specified, the default value for this token is 161.

       transport HOSTSPECIFIER
              This special token should go into a hostname-specific configuration file in a <u>hosts</u> sub-directory.
              For example if the file <u>hosts/foo.conf</u> exists in the search path it will be loaded if a  transport
              name  of  <u>foo</u>  was  used.  Within the foo.conf file you may put both general snmp.conf settings as
              well as a special <u>transport</u> string to  specify  the  destination  to  connect  to.   For  example,
              putting:

                     transport tcp:foo.example.com:9876

              in  the  <u>hosts/foo.conf</u> file will make applications referencing the <u>foo</u> hostname (e.g. <u>snmpget</u>) to
              actually connect via TCP to <u>foo.exmaple.com</u> on port 9876.

       defVersion (1|2c|3)
              defines the default version of SNMP to use.  This can be overridden using the <b>-v</b> option.

       defCommunity STRING
              defines the default community to use for SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c  requests.   This  can  be  overridden
              using the <b>-c</b> option.

       alias NAME DEFINITION
              Creates  an  aliased tied to NAME for a given transport definition.  The alias can the be referred
              to using an alias: prefix.  Eg, a line of "alias here udp:127.0.0.1:6161" would allow you to use a
              destination host of "alias:here" instead of "udp:127.0.0.1:6161".  This becomes more  useful  with
              complex transport addresses involving IPv6 addresses, etc.

       dumpPacket yes
              defines  whether  to  display a hexadecimal dump of the raw SNMP requests sent and received by the
              application.  This is equivalent to the <b>-d</b> option.

       doDebugging (1|0)
              turns on debugging for all applications run if set to 1.

       debugTokens TOKEN[,TOKEN...]
              defines the debugging tokens that should be turned on when <u>doDebugging</u> is set.  This is equivalent
              to the <b>-D</b> option.

       debugLogLevel (emerg|alert|crit|err|warning|notice|info|debug)
              Set the priority level for logging of debug output. Defaults to debug.

       16bitIDs yes
              restricts requestIDs, etc to 16-bit values.

              The SNMP specifications define these ID fields as 32-bit  quantities,  and  the  Net-SNMP  library
              typically  initialises them to random values for security.  However certain (broken) agents cannot
              handle ID values greater than 2^16 - this option allows interoperability with such agents.

       clientaddr [&lt;transport-specifier&gt;:]&lt;transport-address&gt;
              specifies the source address to be used by command-line applications when sending  SNMP  requests.
              See <u><a href="../man1/snmpcmd.1.html">snmpcmd</a>(1)</u> for more information about the format of addresses.

              This value is also used by <b>snmpd</b> when generating notifications.

       clientaddrUsesPort no
              specifies,  if  clientaddr  option contains a port number. Set this option to "yes", if clientaddr
              contains a port number and this port should be used  for  sending  outgoing  SNMP  requests.  This
              option only affects IPv4 client addresses and is ignored for IPv6 client addresses.

       clientRecvBuf INTEGER
              specifies the desired size of the buffer to be used when receiving responses to SNMP requests.  If
              the  OS  hard  limit  is lower than the <u>clientRecvBuf</u> value, then this will be used instead.  Some
              platforms may decide to increase the size of the buffer actually used for internal housekeeping.

              This directive will be ignored if the platforms does not support <u>setsockopt()</u>.

       clientSendBuf INTEGER
              is similar to <u>clientRecvBuf</u>, but applies to  the  size  of  the  buffer  used  when  sending  SNMP
              requests.

       noRangeCheck yes
              disables  the  validation of varbind values against the MIB definition for the relevant OID.  This
              is equivalent to the <b>-Ir</b> option.

              This directive is primarily  relevant  to  the  <b>snmpset</b>  command,  but  will  also  apply  to  any
              application that calls <u>snmp_add_var()</u> with a non-NULL value.

       noTokenWarnings
              disables warnings about unknown config file tokens.

       reverseEncodeBER (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              controls how the encoding of SNMP requests is handled.

              The default behaviour is to encode packets starting from the end of the PDU and working backwards.
              This  directive  can be used to disable this behaviour, and build the encoded request in the (more
              obvious) forward direction.

              It should not normally be necessary to change this setting, as the encoding is basically the  same
              in  either case - but working backwards typically produces a slightly more efficient encoding, and
              hence a smaller network datagram.

       dontLoadHostConfig (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              Specifies whether or not the host-specific configuration files are loaded.  Set to "true" to  turn
              off the loading of the host specific configuration files.

       retries INTEGER
              Specifies the number of retries to be used in the requests.

       timeout INTEGER
              Specifies the timeout in seconds between retries.

</pre><h4><b>SNMPv1/SNMPv2c</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       disableSNMPv1  (1|yes|true|0|no|false)

       disableSNMPv2c (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              Disables  protocol  versions  at  runtime.  Incoming and outgoing packets for the protocol will be
              dropped.

</pre><h4><b>SNMPv3</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       disableSNMPv3  (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              Disables protocol versions at runtime. Incoming and outgoing packets  for  the  protocol  will  be
              dropped.

       defSecurityName STRING
              defines the default security name to use for SNMPv3 requests.  This can be overridden using the <b>-u</b>
              option.

       defSecurityLevel noAuthNoPriv|authNoPriv|authPriv
              defines  the  default security level to use for SNMPv3 requests.  This can be overridden using the
              <b>-l</b> option.

              If not specified, the default value for this token is <u>noAuthNoPriv</u>.

              Note:  <u>authPriv</u> is only available if the software has been compiled to use the OpenSSL libraries.

       defPassphrase STRING

       defAuthPassphrase STRING

       defPrivPassphrase STRING
              define the default authentication and privacy pass phrases to use for SNMPv3 requests.  These  can
              be overridden using the <b>-A</b> and <b>-X</b> options respectively.

              The  <b>defPassphrase</b> value will be used for the authentication and/or privacy pass phrases if either
              of the other directives are not specified.

       defAuthType MD5|SHA|SHA-512|SHA-384|SHA-256|SHA-224

       defPrivType DES|AES
              define the default authentication and privacy protocols to use for SNMPv3 requests.  These can  be
              overridden using the <b>-a</b> and <b>-x</b> options respectively.

              If not specified, SNMPv3 requests will default to MD5 authentication and DES encryption.

              Note:  If  the  software  has  not  been  compiled  to  use  the  OpenSSL libraries, then only MD5
                     authentication is supported.  Neither SHA authentication nor any form of encryption will be
                     available.

       defContext STRING
              defines the default context to use for SNMPv3 requests.  This  can  be  overridden  using  the  <b>-n</b>
              option.

              If  not  specified, the default value for this token is the default context (i.e. the empty string
              "").

       defSecurityModel STRING
              defines the security model to use for SNMPv3 requests.  The default value is "usm"  which  is  the
              only widely used security model for SNMPv3.

       defAuthMasterKey 0xHEXSTRING

       defPrivMasterKey 0xHEXSTRING

       defAuthLocalizedKey 0xHEXSTRING

       defPrivLocalizedKey 0xHEXSTRING
              define  the  (hexadecimal)  keys  to  be  used  for SNMPv3 secure communications.  SNMPv3 keys are
              frequently derived from a passphrase, as discussed in the <u>defPassphrase</u> section above. However for
              improved security a truely random key can be generated and used instead (which would normally  has
              better entropy than a password unless it is amazingly long).  The directives are equivalent to the
              short-form command line options <b>-3m</b>, <b>-3M</b>, <b>-3k</b>, and <b>-3K</b>.

              Localized  keys  are  master keys which have been converted to a unique key which is only suitable
              for on particular SNMP engine (agent).  The length of the key needs  to  be  appropriate  for  the
              authentication  or  encryption type being used (auth keys: MD5=16 bytes, SHA1=20 bytes; priv keys:
              DES=16 bytes (8 bytes of which is used as an IV and not a key), and AES=16 bytes).

       sshtosnmpsocket PATH
              Sets the path of the <b>sshtosnmp</b> socket  created  by  an  application  (e.g.  snmpd)  listening  for
              incoming ssh connections through the <b>sshtosnmp</b> unix socket.

       sshtosnmpsocketperms MODE [OWNER [GROUP]]
              Sets  the  mode,  owner  and  group of the <b>sshtosnmp</b> socket created by an application (e.g. <b>snmpd</b>)
              listening for incoming ssh connections through the <b>sshtosnmp</b> unix socket.  The socket needs to  be
              read/write  privileged  for SSH users that are allowed to connect to the SNMP service (VACM access
              still needs to be granted as well, most likely through the TSM security model).

       sshusername NAME
              Sets the SSH user name for logging into the remote system.

       sshpubkey FILE
              Set the public key file to use when connecting to a remote system.

       sshprivkey FILE
              Set the private key file to use when connecting to a remote system.

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>BEHAVIOUR</b></h4><pre>
       persistentDir DIRECTORY
              defines the directory where <b>snmpd</b> and <b>snmptrapd</b> store persistent configuration settings.

              If not specified, the persistent directory defaults to /var/lib/snmp

       noPersistentLoad yes

       noPersistentSave yes
              disable the loading and saving of persistent configuration information.

              Note:  This will break SNMPv3 operations (and other behaviour that relies  on  changes  persisting
                     across application restart).  Use With Care.

       tempFilePattern PATTERN
              defines  a  filename  template for creating temporary files, for handling input to and output from
              external shell commands.  Used by the <u>mkstemp()</u> and <u>mktemp()</u> functions.

              If not specified, the default pattern is "/tmp/snmpdXXXXXX".

       serverRecvBuf INTEGER
              specifies the desired size of the buffer to be used when receiving incoming SNMP requests.  If the
              OS hard limit is lower than the <u>serverRecvBuf</u>  value,  then  this  will  be  used  instead.   Some
              platforms may decide to increase the size of the buffer actually used for internal housekeeping.

              This directive will be ignored if the platforms does not support <u>setsockopt()</u>.

       serverSendBuf INTEGER
              is  similar  to  <u>serverRecvBuf</u>,  but  applies  to  the  size  of the buffer used when sending SNMP
              responses.

       sourceFilterType none|acceptlist|blocklist
              specifies whether or not addresses added with <u>sourceFilterAddress</u> are  accepted  or  blocked.  The
              default is none, indicating that incoming packets will not be checked agains the filter list.

       sourceFilterAddress ADDRESS
              specifies   an  address  to  be  added  to  the  source  address  filter  list.   <u>sourceFilterType</u>
              configuration determines whether or not addresses are accepted or blocked.

</pre><h4><b>MIB</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       mibdirs DIRLIST
              specifies a list of directories to search for MIB files.  This operates in the same way as the  <b>-M</b>
              option  -  see  <u><a href="../man1/snmpcmd.1.html">snmpcmd</a>(1)</u>  for  details.   Note  that this value can be overridden by the <b>MIBDIRS</b>
              environment variable, and the <b>-M</b> option.

       mibs MIBLIST
              specifies a list of MIB modules (not files) that should be loaded.  This operates in the same  way
              as  the <b>-m</b> option - see <u><a href="../man1/snmpcmd.1.html">snmpcmd</a>(1)</u> for details.  Note that this list can be overridden by the <b>MIBS</b>
              environment variable, and the <b>-m</b> option.

       mibfile FILE
              specifies a (single) MIB file to load, in addition to the  list  read  from  the  <u>mibs</u>  token  (or
              equivalent  configuration).   Note  that  this value can be overridden by the <b>MIBFILES</b> environment
              variable.

       showMibErrors (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              whether to display MIB parsing errors.

       commentToEOL (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              whether MIB parsing should be strict about comment termination.   Many  MIB  writers  assume  that
              ASN.1  comments  extend to the end of the text line, rather than being terminated by the next "--"
              token.  This token can be used to accept such (strictly incorrect) MIBs.
              Note that this  directive  was  previous  (mis-)named  <u>strictCommentTerm</u>,  but  with  the  reverse
              behaviour  from  that  implied  by  the  name.  This earlier token is still accepted for backwards
              compatibility.

       mibAllowUnderline (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              whether to allow underline characters in MIB object names and enumeration values.  This token  can
              be used to accept such (strictly incorrect) MIBs.

       mibWarningLevel INTEGER
              the minimum warning level of the warnings printed by the MIB parser.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       logTimestamp (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              Whether  the  commands  should  log timestamps with their error/message logging or not.  Note that
              output will not look as pretty with timestamps if the source code that is doing the  logging  does
              incremental  logging  of  messages  that  are not line buffered before being passed to the logging
              routines.  This option is only used when file logging is active.

       printNumericEnums (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              Equivalent to <b>-Oe</b>.

       printNumericOids (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              Equivalent to <b>-On</b>.

       dontBreakdownOids (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              Equivalent to <b>-Ob</b>.

       escapeQuotes (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              Equivalent to <b>-OE</b>.

       quickPrinting (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              Equivalent to <b>-Oq</b>.

       printValueOnly (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              Equivalent to <b>-Ov</b>.

       dontPrintUnits (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              Equivalent to <b>-OU</b>.

       numericTimeticks (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              Equivalent to <b>-Ot</b>.

       printHexText (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              Equivalent to <b>-OT</b>.

       hexOutputLength integer
              Specifies where to break up the output of hexadecimal strings.  Set to 0 to disable  line  breaks.
              Defaults to 16.

       suffixPrinting (0|1|2)
              The value 1 is equivalent to <b>-Os</b> and the value 2 is equivalent to <b>-OS</b>.

       oidOutputFormat (1|2|3|4|5|6)
              Maps  -O  options  as  follow:  -Os=1, -OS=2, -Of=3, -On=4, -Ou=5.  The value 6 has no matching -O
              option. It suppresses output.

       extendedIndex (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              Equivalent to <b>-OX</b>.

       noDisplayHint (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              Disables the use of DISPLAY-HINT information when parsing indices and values to set. Equivalent to
              <b>-Ih</b>.

       outputPrecision PRECISION
              Uses the PRECISION string to allow modification of the value output  format.  See  <a href="../man1/snmpcmd.1.html">snmpcmd</a>(1)  for
              details.  Equivalent to <b>-Op</b> (which takes precedence over the config file).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
