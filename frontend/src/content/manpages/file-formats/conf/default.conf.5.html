</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       default.conf - IPA configuration file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/ipa/default.conf, <a href="file:~/.ipa/default.conf">~/.ipa/default.conf</a>, /etc/ipa/server.conf, /etc/ipa/cli.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>default.conf</u>  configuration  file is used to set system-wide defaults to be applied when running IPA
       clients and servers.

       Users may create an optional configuration file in <u><a href="file:~/.ipa/default.conf">~/.ipa/default.conf</a></u> which  will  be  merged  into  the
       system-wide defaults file.

       The following files are read, in order:
           <a href="file:~/.ipa/default.conf">~/.ipa/default.conf</a>
           /etc/ipa/&lt;context&gt;.conf
           /etc/ipa/default.conf
           built-in constants

       The IPA server does not read <a href="file:~/.ipa/default.conf.">~/.ipa/default.conf.</a>

       The first setting wins.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration  options  are  not  case sensitive. The values may be case sensitive, depending on the
       option.

       Blank lines are ignored.  Lines beginning with # are comments and are ignored.

       Valid lines consist of an option name, an equals sign and a value. Spaces  surrounding  equals  sign  are
       ignored. An option terminates at the end of a line.

       Values should not be quoted, the quotes will not be stripped.

           # Wrong - don't include quotes
           verbose = "True"

           # Right - Properly formatted options
           verbose = True
           verbose=True

       Options must appear in the section named [global]. There are no other sections defined or used currently.

       Options may be defined that are not used by IPA. Be careful of misspellings, they will not be rejected.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are relevant for the server:

       <b>basedn</b> &lt;base&gt;
              Specifies  the  base  DN  to  use  when  performing LDAP operations. The base must be in DN format
              (dc=example,dc=com).

       <b>ca_agent_port</b> <b>&lt;port&gt;</b>
              Specifies the secure CA agent port. The default is 8443.

       <b>ca_host</b> <b>&lt;hostname&gt;</b>
              Specifies the hostname of the dogtag CA server. The default is the hostname of the IPA server.

       <b>ca_port</b> <b>&lt;port&gt;</b>
              Specifies the insecure CA end user port. The default is 8080.

       <b>certmonger_wait_timeout</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              The time to wait for a certmonger request to complete during installation. The  default  value  is
              300 seconds.

       <b>context</b> <b>&lt;context&gt;</b>
              Specifies  the context that IPA is being executed in. IPA may operate differently depending on the
              context. The current defined contexts are cli, server and dns. Additionally this value is used  to
              load  /etc/ipa/<b>context</b>.conf to provide context-specific configuration. For example, if you want to
              always perform client requests in verbose mode but do not want to  have  verbose  enabled  on  the
              server, add the verbose option to <u>/etc/ipa/cli.conf</u>.

       <b>debug</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;</b>
              When  True  provides  detailed information. Specifically this set the global log level to "debug".
              Default is False.

       <b>dogtag_version</b> <b>&lt;version&gt;</b>
              Stores the version of Dogtag. Value 9 is assumed if not specified otherwise.

       <b>domain</b> <b>&lt;domain&gt;</b>
              The domain of the IPA server e.g. example.com.

       <b>enable_ra</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;</b>
              Specifies whether the CA is acting as an RA agent, such as  when  dogtag  is  being  used  as  the
              Certificate Authority. This setting only applies to the IPA server configuration.

       <b>fallback</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;</b>
              Specifies  whether  an  IPA client should attempt to fall back and try other services if the first
              connection fails.

       <b>host</b> <b>&lt;hostname&gt;</b>
              Specifies the local system hostname.

       <b>http_timeout</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              Timeout for HTTP blocking requests (e.g. connection). The default value is 30 seconds.

       <b>in_server</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;</b>
              Specifies whether requests should be forwarded to an IPA server or handled locally. This  is  used
              internally  by  IPA  in  a  similar  way  as  context.  The  same IPA framework is used by the ipa
              command-line tool and the server. This setting tells the framework whether it should  execute  the
              command as if on the server or forward it via XML-RPC to a remote server.

       <b>in_tree</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;</b>
              This  is  used  in  development and is generally a detected value. It means that the code is being
              executed within a source tree.

       <b>interactive</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;</b>
              Specifies whether values should be prompted for or not. The default is True.

       <b>kinit_lifetime</b> <b>&lt;time</b> <b>duration</b> <b>spec&gt;</b>
              Controls  the  lifetime  of  ticket  obtained  by  users  authenticating  to  the   WebGUI   using
              login/password.  The  expected format is a time duration string. Examples are "2 hours", "1h:30m",
              "10 minutes", "5min, 30sec". When the parameter is not set in default.conf, the ticket will have a
              duration inherited from the default value for kerberos clients, that can be set as ticket_lifetime
              in krb5.conf. When the ticket lifetime has expired, the ticket is not valid anymore  and  the  GUI
              will prompt to re-login with a message "Your session has expired. Please re-login."

       <b>ldap_cache</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;</b>
              Enable a per-request LDAP cache. The default is True.

       <b>ldap_cache_size</b> <b>&lt;integer&gt;</b>
              The  maximum number of entries cached if ldap_cache is True. Since this cache is per-request it is
              not expected to be very large. The default is 100. Setting the value &lt; 1 effectively disables  the
              cache regardless of the ldap_cache setting

       <b>ldap_cache_debug</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;</b>
              Log details on hits, misses, etc. for the LDAP cache if the cache is enabled.

       <b>ldap_uri</b> <b>&lt;URI&gt;</b>
              Specifies  the  URI  of  the  IPA  LDAP server to connect to. The URI scheme may be one of <b>ldap</b> or
              <b>ldapi</b>. The default is to use ldapi, e.g. ldapi://%2fvar%2frun%2fslapd-EXAMPLE-COM.socket

       <b>log_logger_XXX</b> <b>&lt;comma</b> <b>separated</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>regexps&gt;</b>
              loggers matching regexp will be assigned XXX level.

              Logger levels can be explicitly specified for specific loggers as  opposed  to  a  global  logging
              level.  Specific  loggers  are  indicated  by a list of regular expressions bound to a level. If a
              logger's name matches the regexp then it is assigned that level. This config item must begin  with
              "log_logger_level_" and then be followed by a symbolic or numeric log level, for example:

                log_logger_level_debug = ipalib\.dn\..*

                log_logger_level_35 = ipalib\.plugins\.dogtag

              The  first  line says any logger belonging to the ipalib.dn module will have it's level configured
              to debug.

              The second line say the ipa.plugins.dogtag logger will be configured to level 35.

              This config item is useful when you only want to see the log output  from  one  or  more  selected
              loggers.  Turning  on the global debug flag will produce an enormous amount of output. This allows
              you to leave the global debug flag off and selectively  enable  output  from  a  specific  logger.
              Typically loggers are bound to classes and plugins.

              Note:  logger  names  are  a  dot ('.') separated list forming a path in the logger tree.  The dot
              character is also a regular expression metacharacter (matches any character)  therefore  you  will
              usually need to escape the dot in the logger names by preceding it with a backslash.

       <b>mode</b> <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>
              Specifies  the  mode  the  server  is  running in. The currently support values are <b>production</b> and
              <b>developer</b>. When running in production mode some self-tests are skipped to improve performance.

       <b>mount_ipa</b> <b>&lt;URI&gt;</b>
              Specifies the mount point that the development server will register. The default is /ipa/

       <b>oidc_child_debug_level</b> <b>&lt;debuglevel&gt;</b>
              Specifies the debug level of <b>oidc_child</b>,  a  helper  process  used  by  <b>ipa-otpd</b>  for  OIDC/OAuth2
              authentication.  Level  can be between 0 and 10, the higher the more details. If the level is 6 or
              higher HTTP debug output is added as well.

       <b>passkey_child_debug_level</b> <b>&lt;debuglevel&gt;</b>
              Specifies the debug level of  <b>passkey_child</b>,  a  helper  process  used  by  <b>ipa-otpd</b>  for  passkey
              authentication.  Level  can be between 0 and 10, the higher the more details. If the level is 6 or
              higher libfido2 debug output is added as well.

       <b>prompt_all</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;</b>
              Specifies that all options should be prompted for in the IPA client, even optional values. Default
              is False.

       <b>ra_plugin</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Specifies the name of the CA back end to use. The current options are <b>dogtag</b> and <b>none</b>. This  is  a
              server-side  setting.  Changing  this  value  is not recommended as the CA back end is only set up
              during initial installation.

       <b>realm</b> <b>&lt;realm&gt;</b>
              Specifies the Kerberos realm.

       <b>replication_wait_timeout</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              The time to wait for a new entry to be replicated during replica installation. The  default  value
              is 300 seconds.

       <b>schema_ttl</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              The  number  of seconds for the ipa tool to cache the IPA API and help schema. Reducing this value
              during development is helpful so that API changes are seen sooner in the tool. Setting this  on  a
              server  will  define the TTL for all client versions &gt; 4.3.1. Client versions &gt; 4.3.1 that connect
              to IPA servers older than 4.3.1 will use the client-side configuration value. The default is  3600
              seconds.  0 disables the cache. A change in the ttl will not be immediately recognized by clients.
              They will use the new value once their current cache expires.

       <b>server</b> <b>&lt;hostname&gt;</b>
              Specifies the IPA Server hostname.

       <b>skip_version_check</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;</b>
              Skip client vs. server API version checking.  Can  lead  to  errors/strange  behavior  when  newer
              clients talk to older servers. Use with caution.

       <b>startup_timeout</b> <b>&lt;time</b> <b>in</b> <b>seconds&gt;</b>
              Controls the amount of time waited when starting a service. The default value is 120 seconds.

       <b>startup_traceback</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;</b>
              If  the  IPA  server  fails  to start and this value is True the server will attempt to generate a
              python traceback to make identifying the underlying problem easier.

       <b>validate_api</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;</b>
              Used internally in the IPA source package to verify that the API has not changed. This is used  to
              prevent regressions. If it is true then some errors are ignored so enough of the IPA framework can
              be  loaded to verify all of the API, even if optional components are not installed. The default is
              False.

       <b>verbose</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;</b>
              When True provides more information. Specifically this sets the global log level to "info".

       <b>wait_for_dns</b> <b>&lt;number</b> <b>of</b> <b>attempts&gt;</b>
              Controls whether the IPA commands dnsrecord-{add,mod,del}  work  synchronously  or  not.  The  DNS
              commands  will  repeat  DNS  queries  up  to the specified number of attempts until the DNS server
              returns an up-to-date answer to a query for modified records. Delay between retries is one second.

              The DNS commands will raise a DNSDataMismatch exception if the answer doesn't match  the  expected
              value even after the specified number of attempts.

              The DNS queries will be sent to the resolver configured in <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> on the IPA server.

              Do  not  enable  this in production! This will cause problems if the resolver on IPA server uses a
              caching server instead of a local authoritative server or e.g. if  DNS  answers  are  modified  by
              DNS64. The default is disabled (the option is not present).

       <b>xmlrpc_uri</b> <b>&lt;URI&gt;</b>
              Specifies the URI of the XML-RPC server for a client. This may be used by IPA, and is used by some
              external tools, such as ipa-getcert. Example: https://ipa.example.com/ipa/xml

       <b>jsonrpc_uri</b> <b>&lt;URI&gt;</b>
              Specifies  the  URI  of  the  JSON  server  for a client. This is used by IPA. If not given, it is
              derived from xmlrpc_uri. Example: https://ipa.example.com/ipa/json

       <b>rpc_protocol</b> <b>&lt;URI&gt;</b>
              Specifies the type of RPC calls IPA makes: 'jsonrpc' or 'xmlrpc'. Defaults to 'jsonrpc'.

       The following define the containers for the IPA server. Containers define where in the DIT that objects
       can be found. The full location is the value of container + basedn.
                container_accounts: cn=accounts
                container_applications: cn=applications,cn=configs,cn=policies

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/ipa/default.conf</u>
              system-wide IPA configuration file

       <u>$HOME/.ipa/default.conf</u>
              user IPA configuration file

       It is also possible to define context-specific configuration files. The <b>context</b> is set when the IPA api
       is initialized. The currently defined contexts in IPA are <b>cli</b>, <b>server</b> and <b>dns</b>. This is helpful, for
       example, if you only want <b>debug</b> enabled on the server and not in the client. If this is set to True in
       <u>default.conf</u> it will affect both the ipa client tool and the IPA server. If it is only set in <u>server.conf</u>
       then only the server will have <b>debug</b> set. These files will be loaded if they exist:

       <u>/etc/ipa/cli.conf</u>
              system-wide IPA client configuration file

       <u>/etc/ipa/server.conf</u>
              system-wide IPA server configuration file

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       An example of a context-specific configuration file is <b>/etc/ipa/dns.conf</b> to be used to increase debug
       output of the IPA DNSSEC daemons.

              [global]
