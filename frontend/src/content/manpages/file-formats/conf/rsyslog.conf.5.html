</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rsyslog.conf - <a href="../man8/rsyslogd.8.html">rsyslogd</a>(8) configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>rsyslog.conf</u>  file  is the main configuration file for the <b><a href="../man8/rsyslogd.8.html">rsyslogd</a></b>(8) which logs system messages on
       *nix systems.  This file specifies rules for logging.  For special features see the <b><a href="../man8/rsyslogd.8.html">rsyslogd</a></b>(8)  manpage.
       Rsyslog.conf is backward-compatible with sysklogd's syslog.conf file. So if you migrate from sysklogd you
       can rename it and it should work.

       <b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>rsyslog</b> <b>ships</b> <b>with</b> <b>extensive</b> <b>documentation</b> <b>in</b> <b>HTML</b> <b>format.</b>  This is provided in
       the  ./doc  subdirectory  and  probably  in  a  separate package if you installed rsyslog via a packaging
       system.  To use rsyslog's advanced features, you <b>need</b> to look at the HTML documentation, because the  man
       pages only cover basic aspects of operation.

</pre><h4><b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       Rsyslog  has  a  modular  design.  Consequently,  there  is  a  growing  number  of modules. See the HTML
       documentation for their full description.

       <u>omsnmp</u> SNMP trap output module

       <u>omgssapi</u>
              Output module for GSS-enabled syslog

       <u>ommysql</u>
              Output module for MySQL

       <u>omrelp</u> Output module for the reliable RELP protocol (prevents message loss).  For details, see  below  at
              imrelp and the HTML documentation.  It can be used like this:

              *.*  :omrelp:server:port

              *.*  :omrelp:192.168.0.1:2514 # actual sample

       <u>ompgsql</u>
              Output module for PostgreSQL

       <u>omlibdbi</u>
              Generic database output module (Firebird/Interbase, MS SQL, Sybase, SQLite, Ingres, Oracle, mSQL)

       <u>imfile</u> Input module for text files

       <u>imudp</u>  Input plugin for UDP syslog. Replaces the deprecated -r option. Can be used like this:

              $ModLoad imudp

              $UDPServerRun 514

       <u>imtcp</u>  Input plugin for plain TCP syslog. Replaces the deprecated -t option. Can be used like this:

              $ModLoad imtcp

              $InputTCPServerRun 514

       <u>imrelp</u> Input plugin for the RELP protocol. RELP can be used instead of UDP or plain TCP syslog to provide
              reliable  delivery  of  syslog  messages. Please note that plain TCP syslog does NOT provide truly
              reliable delivery, with it messages may be lost when there is a connection problem or  the  server
              shuts down.  RELP prevents message loss in those cases.  It can be used like this:

              $ModLoad imrelp

              $InputRELPServerRun 2514

       <u>imgssapi</u>
              Input plugin for plain TCP and GSS-enable syslog

       <u>immark</u> Support for mark messages

       <u>imklog</u> Kernel logging. To include kernel log messages, you need to do

              $ModLoad imklog

              Please  note  that  the klogd daemon is no longer necessary and consequently no longer provided by
              the rsyslog package.

       <u>imuxsock</u>
              Unix sockets, including the system log socket. You need to specify

              $ModLoad imuxsock

              in order to receive log messages from local system processes. This config  directive  should  only
              left out if you know exactly what you are doing.

</pre><h4><b>BASIC</b> <b>STRUCTURE</b></h4><pre>
       Lines starting with a hash mark ('#') and empty lines are ignored.  Rsyslog.conf should contain following
       sections (sorted by recommended order in file):

       Global directives
              Global  directives  set  some  global properties of whole rsyslog daemon, for example size of main
              message queue ($MainMessageQueueSize), loading external modules ($ModLoad) and so on.  All  global
              directives  need  to  be  specified  on a line by their own and must start with a dollar-sign. The
              complete list of global directives can be found in HTML documentation in doc directory  or  online
              on web pages.

       Templates
              Templates  allow  you to specify format of the logged message. They are also used for dynamic file
              name generation. They have to be defined before they are  used  in  rules.  For  more  info  about
              templates see TEMPLATES section of this manpage.

       Output channels
              Output channels provide an umbrella for any type of output that the user might want.  They have to
              be  defined before they are used in rules. For more info about output channels see OUTPUT CHANNELS
              section of this manpage.

       Rules (selector + action)
              Every rule line consists of two fields, a selector field and an action field. These two fields are
              separated by one or more spaces or tabs. The selector field specifies a pattern of facilities  and
              priorities belonging to the specified action.

</pre><h4><b>SELECTORS</b></h4><pre>
       The  selector  field itself again consists of two parts, a facility and a priority, separated by a period
       ('.'). Both parts are case insensitive and can also be specified as decimal numbers, but don't  do  that,
       you  have  been  warned.   Both facilities and priorities are described in <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a>(3). The names mentioned
       below correspond to the similar LOG_-values in /usr/include/syslog.h.

       The facility is one of the following keywords: auth, authpriv, cron, daemon, kern, lpr, mail, mark, news,
       security (same as auth), syslog, user, uucp and local0 through local7. The keyword security should not be
       used anymore and mark is only for internal use and therefore should not be used in applications.  Anyway,
       you may want to specify and redirect these messages here.  The  facility  specifies  the  subsystem  that
       produced  the  message,  i.e.  all  mail programs log with the mail facility (LOG_MAIL) if they log using
       syslog.

       The priority is one of the following keywords, in ascending order: debug,  info,  notice,  warning,  warn
       (same  as  warning),  err,  error  (same as err), crit, alert, emerg, panic (same as emerg). The keywords
       error, warn and panic are deprecated and should not be used anymore. The priority defines the severity of
       the message.

       The behavior of the original BSD syslogd is that all messages of the specified priority  and  higher  are
       logged according to the given action. Rsyslogd behaves the same, but has some extensions.

       In  addition  to  the  above  mentioned  names  the  <a href="../man8/rsyslogd.8.html">rsyslogd</a>(8) understands the following extensions: An
       asterisk ('*') stands for all facilities or all priorities, depending on where  it  is  used  (before  or
       after the period). The keyword none stands for no priority of the given facility.

       You can specify multiple facilities with the same priority pattern in one statement using the comma (',')
       operator.  You may specify as much facilities as you want. Remember that only the facility part from such
       a statement is taken, a priority part would be skipped.

       Multiple selectors may be specified for a single action using the  semicolon  (';')  separator.  Remember
       that  each selector in the selector field is capable to overwrite the preceding ones. Using this behavior
       you can exclude some priorities from the pattern.

       Rsyslogd has a syntax extension to the original BSD source, that makes its use more intuitively. You  may
       precede  every priority with an equals sign ('=') to specify only this single priority and not any of the
       above. You may also (both is valid, too) precede the priority with an exclamation mark  ('!')  to  ignore
       all  that  priorities,  either exact this one or this and any higher priority. If you use both extensions
       then the exclamation mark must occur before the equals sign, just use it intuitively.

       However, please note that there are some restrictions over the traditional BSD  syslog  behaviour.  These
       restrictions stem back to sysklogd, exist probably since at least the 1990's and as such have always been
       in rsyslog.

       Namely, in BSD syslogd you can craft a selector like this:

       *.debug;local6.err

       The  intent  is to log all facilities at debug or higher, except for local6, which should only log at err
       or higher.

       Unfortunately, local6.err will permit error severity and higher, but  will  not  exclude  lower  severity
       messages from facility local6.

       As an alternative, you can explicitly exclude all severities that you do not want to match. For the above
       case, this selector is equivalent to the BSD syslog selector:

       *.debug;local6.!=info;local6.!=notice;local6.!=warn

       An easier approach is probably to do if ... then based matching in script.

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  action field of a rule describes what to do with the message. In general, message content is written
       to a kind of "logfile". But also other actions might be  done,  like  writing  to  a  database  table  or
       forwarding to another host.

   <b>Regular</b> <b>file</b>
       Typically  messages  are logged to real files. The file has to be specified with full pathname, beginning
       with a slash ('/').

       <b>Example:</b>
              *.*     /var/log/traditionalfile.log;RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat      # log to  a  file  in  the
              traditional format

       Note:  if  you  would  like  to  use  high-precision  timestamps  in  your  log  files,  just  remove the
       ";RSYSLOG_TraditionalFormat". That will select the default template, which, if not changed, uses RFC 3339
       timestamps.

       <b>Example:</b>
              *.*     /var/log/file.log # log to a file with RFC3339 timestamps

       By default, files are not synced after each write. To enable syncing of log files  globally,  use  either
       the  "$ActionFileEnableSync"  directive  or the "sync" parameter to omfile. Enabling this option degrades
       performance and it is advised not to enable syncing unless you know what you are doing.   To  selectively
       disable syncing for certain files, you may prefix the file path with a minus sign ("-").

   <b>Named</b> <b>pipes</b>
       This  version  of <a href="../man8/rsyslogd.8.html">rsyslogd</a>(8) has support for logging output to named pipes (fifos). A fifo or named pipe
       can be used as a destination for log messages by prepending a pipe symbol ('|') to the name of the  file.
       This  is  handy  for  debugging.  Note  that  the  fifo must be created with the <a href="../man1/mkfifo.1.html">mkfifo</a>(1) command before
       <a href="../man8/rsyslogd.8.html">rsyslogd</a>(8) is started.

   <b>Terminal</b> <b>and</b> <b>console</b>
       If the file you specified is a tty, special tty-handling is done, same with /dev/console.

   <b>Remote</b> <b>machine</b>
       There are three ways to forward message: the traditional UDP transport,  which  is  extremely  lossy  but
       standard, the plain TCP based transport which loses messages only during certain situations but is widely
       available  and the RELP transport which does not lose messages but is currently available only as part of
       rsyslogd 3.15.0 and above.

       To forward messages to another host via UDP, prepend the hostname with the at sign ("@").  To forward  it
       via  plain  tcp, prepend two at signs ("@@"). To forward via RELP, prepend the string ":omrelp:" in front
       of the hostname.

       <b>Example:</b>
              *.* @192.168.0.1

       In the example above, messages are forwarded via UDP to the machine  192.168.0.1,  the  destination  port
       defaults  to  514.  Due  to  the  nature of UDP, you will probably lose some messages in transit.  If you
       expect high traffic volume, you can expect to lose a quite noticeable number of messages (the higher  the
       traffic, the more likely and severe is message loss).

       Sockets  for forwarded messages can be bound to a specific device using the "device" option for the omfwd
       module.

       <b>Example:</b>
              action(type="omfwd" Target="192.168.0.1" Device="eth0" Port=514 Protocol="udp")

       In the example above, messages are forwarded via UDP to the machine 192.168.0.1  at  port  514  over  the
       device eth0. TCP can be used by setting Protocol to "tcp" in the above example.

       For Linux with VRF support, the device option is used to specify the VRF to send messages.

       <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>message</b> <b>loss,</b> <b>use</b> <b>RELP:</b>
              *.* :omrelp:192.168.0.1:2514

       Note that a port number was given as there is no standard port for relp.

       Keep in mind that you need to load the correct input and output plugins (see "Modules" above).

       Please  note  that  rsyslogd  offers  a  variety  of  options in regarding to remote forwarding. For full
       details, please see the HTML documentation.

   <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b>
       Usually critical messages are also directed to ``root'' on that machine. You can specify a list of  users
       that  shall  get  the  message by simply writing ":omusrmsg:" followed by the login name. You may specify
       more than one user by separating them with commas (','). If they're logged in they get the  message  (for
       example: ":omusrmsg:root,user1,user2").

   <b>Everyone</b> <b>logged</b> <b>on</b>
       Emergency  messages  often  go  to  all  users  currently online to notify them that something strange is
       happening with the system. To specify this <a href="../man1/wall.1.html">wall</a>(1)-feature use an ":omusrmsg:*".

   <b>Database</b> <b>table</b>
       This allows logging of the message to a database table.  By default, a MonitorWare-compatible  schema  is
       required  for  this  to  work.  You  can create that schema with the createDB.SQL file that came with the
       rsyslog package. You can also use any other schema of your liking - you just  need  to  define  a  proper
       template and assign this template to the action.

       See the HTML documentation for further details on database logging.

   <b>Discard</b>
       If  the  discard  action  is  carried  out, the received message is immediately discarded. Discard can be
       highly effective if you want to filter out some annoying messages that  otherwise  would  fill  your  log
       files.  To  do  that,  place  the  discard  actions  early in your log files.  This often plays well with
       property-based filters, giving you great freedom in specifying what you do not want.

       Discard is just the single 'stop' command with no further parameters.

       <b>Example:</b>
              *.*   stop      # discards everything.

   <b>Output</b> <b>channel</b>
       Binds an output channel definition (see there for details) to this action. Output  channel  actions  must
       start  with  a  $-sign,  e.g. if you would like to bind your output channel definition "mychannel" to the
       action, use "$mychannel". Output channels support template definitions like all all other actions.

   <b>Shell</b> <b>execute</b>
       This executes a program in a subshell. The program is passed the template-generated message as  the  only
       command line parameter. Rsyslog waits until the program terminates and only then continues to run.

       <b>Example:</b>
              ^program-to-execute;template

       The program-to-execute can be any valid executable. It receives the template string as a single parameter
       (argv[1]).

</pre><h4><b>FILTER</b> <b>CONDITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Rsyslog offers three different types "filter conditions":
          * "traditional" severity and facility based selectors
          * property-based filters
          * expression-based filters

   <b>Selectors</b>
       <b>Selectors</b>  <b>are</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>traditional</b>  <b>way</b>  <b>of</b> <b>filtering</b> <b>syslog</b> <b>messages.</b>  They have been kept in rsyslog with
       their original syntax, because it is well-known, highly effective and also needed for compatibility  with
       stock  syslogd configuration files. If you just need to filter based on priority and facility, you should
       do this with selector lines. They are not second-class citizens in rsyslog and offer the best performance
       for this job.

   <b>Property-Based</b> <b>Filters</b>
       Property-based filters are unique to rsyslogd. They allow one to filter on any property,  like  HOSTNAME,
       syslogtag and msg.

       A  property-based  filter  must  start  with  a colon in column 0. This tells rsyslogd that it is the new
       filter type. The colon must be followed by the property name, a comma, the name of the compare  operation
       to  carry out, another comma and then the value to compare against. This value must be quoted.  There can
       be spaces and tabs between the commas. Property names and compare operations are case-sensitive, so "msg"
       works, while "MSG" is an invalid property name. In brief, the syntax is as follows:

              :property, [!]compare-operation, "value"

       The following compare-operations are currently supported:

              <b>contains</b>
                     Checks if the string provided in value is contained in the property

              <b>isequal</b>
                     Compares the "value" string provided and the property contents. These two  values  must  be
                     exactly equal to match.

              <b>startswith</b>
                     Checks if the value is found exactly at the beginning of the property value

              <b>regex</b>
                     Compares the property against the provided regular expression.

   <b>Expression-Based</b> <b>Filters</b>
       See the HTML documentation for this feature.

</pre><h4><b>TEMPLATES</b></h4><pre>
       Every  output  in  rsyslog uses templates - this holds true for files, user messages and so on. Templates
       compatible with the stock syslogd formats are hardcoded into rsyslogd. If no template  is  specified,  we
       use one of these hardcoded templates. Search for "template_" in syslogd.c and you will find the hardcoded
       ones.

       A  template  consists  of  a template directive, a name, the actual template text and optional options. A
       sample is:

              <b>$template</b> <b>MyTemplateName,"\7Text</b> <b>%property%</b> <b>some</b> <b>more</b> <b>text\n",&lt;options&gt;</b>

       The "$template" is the template directive. It tells rsyslog that  this  line  contains  a  template.  The
       backslash  is  an  escape character. For example, \7 rings the bell (this is an ASCII value), \n is a new
       line. The set in rsyslog is a bit restricted currently.

       All text in the template is used literally, except for things within percent signs. These are  properties
       and  allow  you  access  to  the contents of the syslog message. Properties are accessed via the property
       replacer and it can for example pick a substring or do date-specific formatting.  More  on  this  is  the
       PROPERTY REPLACER section of this manpage.

       To escape:
          % = \%
          \ = \\ --&gt; '\' is used to escape (as in C)
       $template TraditionalFormat,"%timegenerated% %HOSTNAME% %syslogtag%%msg%\n"

       Properties can be accessed by the property replacer (see there for details).

       <b>Please</b>  <b>note</b>  <b>that</b>  <b>templates</b>  <b>can</b>  <b>also</b> <b>by</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>selector</b> <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>file</b> <b>names.</b>  For
       example, if you would like to split syslog messages from different hosts  to  different  files  (one  per
       host), you can define the following template:

              <b>$template</b> <b>DynFile,"/var/log/system-%HOSTNAME%.log"</b>

       This  template  can  then be used when defining an output selector line. It will result in something like
       "/var/log/system-localhost.log"

   <b>Template</b> <b>options</b>
       The &lt;options&gt; part is optional. It carries options influencing the template as whole.  See details below.
       Be sure NOT to mistake template options with property options - the  later  ones  are  processed  by  the
       property replacer and apply to a SINGLE property, only (and not the whole template).

       Template options are case-insensitive. Currently defined are:

              sql    format  the  string  suitable for a SQL statement in MySQL format. This will replace single
                     quotes ("'") and the backslash character by their backslash-escaped  counterpart  ("´"  and
                     "\")  inside  each field. Please note that in MySQL configuration, the NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES
                     mode must be turned off for this format to work (this is the default).

              stdsql format the string suitable for a SQL statement that is to be sent to a  standards-compliant
                     sql  server.  This will replace single quotes ("'") by two single quotes ("''") inside each
                     field.   You  must  use  stdsql  together  with  MySQL  if  in  MySQL   configuration   the
                     NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES is turned on.

       Either  the  <b>sql</b>  or  <b>stdsql</b>  option <b>MUST</b> be specified when a template is used for writing to a database,
       otherwise injection might occur. Please note that due to the unfortunate fact that several  vendors  have
       violated  the  sql  standard  and  introduced their own escape methods, it is impossible to have a single
       option doing all the work.  So you yourself must make sure you are using the right format.  <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>choose</b>
       <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>one,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> <b>sql</b> <b>injection.</b>

       Please note that the database writer *checks* that the sql option is present in the template.  If  it  is
       not  present,  the write database action is disabled.  This is to guard you against accidental forgetting
       it and then becoming vulnerable to SQL injection. The  sql  option  can  also  be  useful  with  files  -
       especially  if  you  want  to  import  them  into  a database on another machine for performance reasons.
       However, do NOT use it if you do not have a real need for it - among others, it takes some  toll  on  the
       processing time. Not much, but on a really busy system you might notice it ;)

       The default template for the write to database action has the sql option set.

   <b>Template</b> <b>examples</b>
       Please  note  that  the  samples  are  split across multiple lines. A template MUST NOT actually be split
       across multiple lines.

       A template that resembles traditional syslogd file output:

              $template TraditionalFormat,"%timegenerated% %HOSTNAME%
              %syslogtag%%msg:::drop-last-lf%\n"

       A template that tells you a little more about the message:

              $template precise,"%syslogpriority%,%syslogfacility%,%timegenerated%,%HOSTNAME%,
              %syslogtag%,%msg%\n"

       A template for RFC 3164 format:

              $template RFC3164fmt,"&lt;%PRI%&gt;%TIMESTAMP% %HOSTNAME% %syslogtag%%msg%"

       A template for the format traditionally used for user messages:

              $template usermsg," XXXX%syslogtag%%msg%\n\r"

       And a template with the traditional wall-message format:

              $template wallmsg,"\r\n\7Message from syslogd@%HOSTNAME% at %timegenerated%"

       <b>A</b> <b>template</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>database</b> <b>(please</b> <b>note</b> <b>the</b> <b>SQL</b> <b>template</b> <b>option)</b>

              $template MySQLInsert,"insert iut, message, receivedat values ('%iut%', '%msg:::UPPERCASE%',
              '%timegenerated:::date-mysql%') into systemevents\r\n", SQL

              NOTE 1: This template is embedded into core application under name <b>StdDBFmt</b> , so you don't need to
              define it.

              NOTE 2: You have to have MySQL module installed to use this template.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>CHANNELS</b></h4><pre>
       Output Channels are a new concept first introduced in rsyslog 0.9.0. As  of  this  writing,  it  is  most
       likely  that they will be replaced by something different in the future.  So if you use them, be prepared
       to change you configuration file syntax when you upgrade to a later release.

       Output channels are defined via an $outchannel directive. It's syntax is as follows:

              <b>$outchannel</b> <b>name,file-name,max-size,action-on-max-size</b>

       name is the name of the output channel (not the file), file-name is the file name to be written to,  max-
       size the maximum allowed size and action-on-max-size a command to be issued when the max size is reached.
       This  command  always has exactly one parameter. The binary is that part of action-on-max-size before the
       first space, its parameter is everything behind that space.

       Keep in mind that $outchannel just defines a channel with "name". It does not activate it.  To do so, you
       must use a selector line (see below). That selector line includes the channel name  plus  ":omfile:$"  in
       front of it. A sample might be:

              *.* :omfile:$mychannel

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTY</b> <b>REPLACER</b></h4><pre>
       The  property  replacer is a core component in rsyslogd's output system. A syslog message has a number of
       well-defined properties (see below). Each of this properties can  be  accessed  and  manipulated  by  the
       property replacer. With it, it is easy to use only part of a property value or manipulate the value, e.g.
       by converting all characters to lower case.

   <b>Accessing</b> <b>Properties</b>
       Syslog  message  properties  are used inside templates. They are accessed by putting them between percent
       signs. Properties can be modified by the property replacer. The full syntax is as follows:

              <b>%propname:fromChar:toChar:options%</b>

       propname is the name of the property to access.  <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>case-sensitive.</b>

   <b>Available</b> <b>Properties</b>
       <b>msg</b>    the MSG part of the message (aka "the message" ;))

       <b>rawmsg</b> the message exactly as it was received from the socket. Should be useful for debugging.

       <b>HOSTNAME</b>
              hostname from the message

       <b>FROMHOST</b>
              hostname of the system the message was received from  (in  a  relay  chain,  this  is  the  system
              immediately in front of us and not necessarily the original sender)

       <b>syslogtag</b>
              TAG from the message

       <b>programname</b>
              the  "static" part of the tag, as defined by BSD syslogd. For example, when TAG is "named[12345]",
              programname is "named".

       <b>PRI</b>    PRI part of the message - undecoded (single value)

       <b>PRI-text</b>
              the PRI part of the message in a textual form (e.g. "syslog.info")

       <b>IUT</b>    the monitorware InfoUnitType - used when talking to a MonitorWare backend (also for phpLogCon)

       <b>syslogfacility</b>
              the facility from the message - in numerical form

       <b>syslogfacility-text</b>
              the facility from the message - in text form

       <b>syslogseverity</b>
              severity from the message - in numerical form

       <b>syslogseverity-text</b>
              severity from the message - in text form

       <b>timegenerated</b>
              timestamp when the message was RECEIVED. Always in high resolution

       <b>timereported</b>
              timestamp from the message. Resolution depends on what was provided in the message (in most cases,
              only seconds)

       <b>TIMESTAMP</b>
              alias for timereported

       <b>PROTOCOL-VERSION</b>
              The contents of the PROTOCOL-VERSION field from IETF draft draft-ietf-syslog-protocol

       <b>STRUCTURED-DATA</b>
              The contents of the STRUCTURED-DATA field from IETF draft draft-ietf-syslog-protocol

       <b>APP-NAME</b>
              The contents of the APP-NAME field from IETF draft draft-ietf-syslog-protocol

       <b>PROCID</b> The contents of the PROCID field from IETF draft draft-ietf-syslog-protocol

       <b>MSGID</b>  The contents of the MSGID field from IETF draft draft-ietf-syslog-protocol

       <b>$NOW</b>   The current date stamp in the format YYYY-MM-DD

       <b>$YEAR</b>  The current year (4-digit)

       <b>$MONTH</b> The current month (2-digit)

       <b>$DAY</b>   The current day of the month (2-digit)

       <b>$HOUR</b>  The current hour in military (24 hour) time (2-digit)

       <b>$MINUTE</b>
              The current minute (2-digit)

       Properties starting with a $-sign are so-called system properties. These do NOT stem from the message but
       are rather internally-generated.

   <b>Character</b> <b>Positions</b>
       FromChar and toChar are used to build substrings. They specify the offset within the string  that  should
       be  copied.  Offset  counting starts at 1, so if you need to obtain the first 2 characters of the message
       text, you can use this syntax: "%msg:1:2%". If you do not wish to specify from and to, but  you  want  to
       specify options, you still need to include the colons. For example, if you would like to convert the full
       message  text  to lower case, use "%msg:::lowercase%". If you would like to extract from a position until
       the end of the string, you can place a dollar-sign ("$") in toChar (e.g. %msg:10:$%, which  will  extract
       from position 10 to the end of the string).

       There is also support for <b>regular</b> <b>expressions.</b>  To use them, you need to place a "R" into FromChar.  This
       tells  rsyslog  that  a  regular  expression  instead of position-based extraction is desired. The actual
       regular expression <b>must</b> then be provided in toChar. The regular expression must be followed by the string
       "--end". It denotes the end of the regular expression and will not become part of it.  If you  are  using
       regular  expressions,  the  property  replacer will return the part of the property text that matches the
       regular expression.  An  example  for  a  property  replacer  sequence  with  a  regular  expression  is:
       "%msg:R:.*Sev:. \(.*\) \[.*--end%"

       Also, extraction can be done based on so-called "fields". To do so, place a "F" into FromChar. A field in
       its  current  definition is anything that is delimited by a delimiter character. The delimiter by default
       is TAB (US-ASCII value 9). However, if can be changed to any other US-ASCII  character  by  specifying  a
       comma  and  the  decimal  US-ASCII  value of the delimiter immediately after the "F". For example, to use
       comma (",") as a delimiter, use this field specifier: "F,44".  If your syslog data is delimited, this  is
       a  quicker  way  to extract than via regular expressions (actually, a *much* quicker way). Field counting
       starts at 1. Field zero is accepted, but will always lead to a "field not found" error. The same  happens
       if a field number higher than the number of fields in the property is requested. The field number must be
       placed in the "ToChar" parameter. An example where the 3rd field (delimited by TAB) from the msg property
       is extracted is as follows: "%msg:F:3%". The same example with semicolon as delimiter is "%msg:F,59:3%".

       Please note that the special characters "F" and "R" are case-sensitive. Only upper case works, lower case
       will  return  an  error. There are no white spaces permitted inside the sequence (that will lead to error
       messages and will NOT provide the intended result).

   <b>Property</b> <b>Options</b>
       Property options are case-insensitive. Currently, the following options are defined:

       uppercase
              convert property to lowercase only

       lowercase
              convert property text to uppercase only

       drop-last-lf
              The last LF in the message (if any), is dropped. Especially useful for PIX.

       date-mysql
              format as mysql date

       date-rfc3164
              format as RFC 3164 date

       date-rfc3339
              format as RFC 3339 date

       escape-cc
              replace control characters (ASCII value 127 and values less then 32) with an escape sequence.  The
              sequence  is "#&lt;charval&gt;" where charval is the 3-digit decimal value of the control character. For
              example, a tabulator would be replaced by "#009".

       space-cc
              replace control characters by spaces

       drop-cc
              drop control characters - the resulting string will neither  contain  control  characters,  escape
              sequences nor any other replacement character like space.

</pre><h4><b>QUEUED</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Rsyslogd  supports queued operations to handle offline outputs (like remote syslogd's or database servers
       being down). When running in queued mode, rsyslogd buffers messages to memory and optionally to disk  (on
       an as-needed basis). Queues survive rsyslogd restarts.

       It is highly suggested to use remote forwarding and database writing in queued mode, only.

       To learn more about queued operations, see the HTML documentation.
