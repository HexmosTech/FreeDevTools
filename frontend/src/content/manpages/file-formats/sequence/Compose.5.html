       Compose - X client mappings for multi-key input sequences

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  X library, libX11, provides a simple input method for characters beyond those represented on typical
       keyboards using sequences of key strokes that are combined to enter a single character.

       The compose file is searched for in  the following order:

       -      If the environment variable <b>$XCOMPOSEFILE</b> is set, its value is used as the  name  of  the  Compose
              file.

       -      If the user's home directory has a file named <u>.XCompose</u>, it is used as the Compose file.

       -      The  system provided compose file is used by mapping the locale to a compose file from the list in
              <u><a href="file:/usr/share/X11/locale/compose.dir">/usr/share/X11/locale/compose.dir</a></u>.

       Compose files can use an "<b>include</b>" instruction.  This allows local modifications to be made  to  existing
       compose files without including all of the content directly.  For example, the system's iso8859-1 compose
       file can be included with a line like this:
           <b>include</b> <b>"</b><u>%S/iso8859-1/Compose</u><b>"</b>

       There are several substitutions that can be made in the file name of the include instruction:

       <u>%H</u>  expands to the user's home directory (the <b>$HOME</b> environment variable)

       <u>%L</u>  expands     to     the     name     of     the     locale     specific     Compose     file    (i.e.,
           "<u><a href="file:/usr/share/X11/locale/">/usr/share/X11/locale/</a>&lt;localename&gt;/Compose</u>")

       <u>%S</u>  expands to the name of the system directory for Compose files (i.e., "<u><a href="file:/usr/share/X11/locale">/usr/share/X11/locale</a></u>")

       For example, you can include in your compose file the default Compose file by using:
              <b>include</b> <b>"%L"</b>
       and then rewrite only the few rules that you need to  change.   New  compose  rules  can  be  added,  and
       previous ones replaced.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Compose  files are plain text files, with a separate line for each compose sequence.  Comments begin with
       <b>#</b> characters.  Each compose sequence specifies one or more events and a resulting input sequence, with an
       optional comment at the end of the line:
              <u>EVENT</u> [<u>EVENT</u>...] <b>:</b> <u>RESULT</u> [<b>#</b> <u>COMMENT</u>]

       Each event consists of a specified input keysym, and optional modifier states:
              [([<b>!</b>] ([<b>~</b>] <u>MODIFIER</u>)...) | <b>None</b>] <b>&lt;</b><u>keysym</u><b>&gt;</b>

       If the modifier list is preceded by "<b>!</b>" it must match exactly.  MODIFIER may be one of Ctrl, Lock,  Caps,
       Shift,  Alt or Meta.  Each modifier may be preceded by a "<b>~</b>" character to indicate that the modifier must
       not be present.  If "<b>None</b>" is specified, no modifier may be present.

       The result specifies a string, keysym, or both, that the X client receives as input when the sequence  of
       events is input:
              <b>"</b><u>STRING</u><b>"</b> | <u>keysym</u> | <b>"</b><u>STRING</u><b>"</b> <u>keysym</u>

       Keysyms are specified without the <b>XK_</b> prefix.

       Strings  may be direct text encoded in the locale for which the compose file is to be used, or an escaped
       octal or hexadecimal character code.  Octal codes are  specified  as  <b>"\123"</b>  and  hexadecimal  codes  as
       <b>"\x3a"</b>.   It  is not necessary to specify in the right part of a rule a locale encoded string in addition
       to the keysym name.  If the string is omitted, Xlib figures it out  from  the  keysym  according  to  the
       current locale.  I.e., if a rule looks like:
              <b>&lt;dead_grave&gt;</b> <b>&lt;A&gt;</b> <b>:</b> <b>"\300"</b> <b>Agrave</b>
       the result of the composition is always the letter with the "\300" code.  But if the rule is:
              <b>&lt;dead_grave&gt;</b> <b>&lt;A&gt;</b> <b>:</b> <b>Agrave</b>
       the result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.
