</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nfsmount.conf - Configuration file for NFS mounts

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration file for NFS mounts that allows options to be set globally, per server or per mount point.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file is made up of multiple section headers followed by variable assignments associated
       with  that  section.   A  section  header  is defined by a string enclosed by <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> brackets.  Variable
       assignments are assignment statements that assign values to particular variables using the <b>=</b> operator, as
       in <b>Proto=Tcp</b>.  The variables that can be assigned are the set of NFS specific  mount  options  listed  in
       <b><a href="../man5/nfs.5.html">nfs</a></b>(5)  together  with  the  filesystem-independant mount options listed in <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8) and three additions:
       <b>Sloppy=True</b> has the same effect as the <b>-s</b> option to <u>mount</u>, and <b>Foreground=True</b> and  <b>Background=True</b>  have
       the same effect as <b>bg</b> and <b>fg</b>.

       Options  in the config file may be given in upper, lower, or mixed case and will be shifted to lower case
       before being passed to the filesystem.

       Boolean mount options which do not need an equals sign  must  be  given  as  "<u>option</u>=True".   Instead  of
       preceding such an option with "<b>no</b>" its negation must be given as "<u>option</u>=False".

       Sections  are  broken  up  into  three  basic  categories: Global options, Server options and Mount Point
       options.

       <b>[</b> <b>NFSMount_Global_Options</b> <b>]</b> - This statically named section defines all of the global mount options  that
              can be applied to every NFS mount.

       <b>[</b>  <b>Server</b> <b>"Server_Name"</b> <b>]</b> - This section defines all the mount options that should be used on mounts to a
              particular NFS server. The <u>"Server_Name"</u> strings needs to be surrounded by '"'  and  be  an  exact
              match (ignoring case) of the server name used in the <b>mount</b> command.

       <b>[</b>  <b>MountPoint</b>  <b>"Mount_Point"</b>  <b>]</b>  -  This  section  defines all the mount options that should be used on a
              particular mount point.  The <u>"Mount_Point"</u> string needs to be surrounded by '"' and  be  an  exact
              match of the mount point used in the <b>mount</b> command.  Though path names are usually case-sensitive,
              the Mount_Point name is matched insensitive to case.

       The sections are processed in the reverse of the order listed above, and any options already seen, either
       in a previous section or on the command line, will be ignored when seen again.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       These are some example lines of how sections and variables are defined in the configuration file.

       [ NFSMount_Global_Options ]
           Proto=Tcp

              The TCP/IPv4 protocol will be used on every NFS mount.

       [ Server "nfsserver.foo.com" ]
           rsize=32k
           wsize=32k
           proto=udp6

              A  32k  (32768  bytes)  block  size  will  be used as the read and write size on all mounts to the
              'nfsserver.foo.com' server.  UDP/IPv6 is the protocol to be used.

       [ MountPoint "/export/home" ]
           Background=True

              All mounts  to  the  '/export/home'  export  will  be  performed  in  the  background  (i.e.  done
              asynchronously).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/usr/etc/nfsmount.conf</u>
       <u>/usr/etc/nfsmount.conf.d/*.conf</u>
       <u>/etc/nfsmount.conf</u>
       <u>/etc/nfsmount.conf.d/*.conf</u>

              Default  NFS  mount  configuration  files,  variables set in the later file over-ride those in the
              earlier file.
