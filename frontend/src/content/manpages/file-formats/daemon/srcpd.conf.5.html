</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       srcpd.conf - The configuration file for the srcpd daemon

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The file <u>/etc/srcpd.conf</u> is used by the  <b>srcpd</b> <b>(8)</b>.  This file contains the runtime configuration for the
       daemon  and  it's  connection(s)  to model railroad system.  See <b>srcpd</b> <b>(8)</b> for instruction how to use the
       daemon.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The default file is shipped as with the srcpd and contains both  default  settings  and  an  example  bus
       configuration.

              &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
              &lt;srcpd version="2.0"&gt;
                &lt;bus&gt;
                  &lt;server&gt;
                    &lt;tcp-port&gt;4303&lt;/tcp-port&gt;
                    &lt;pid-file&gt;/var/run/srcpd.pid&lt;/pid-file&gt;
                    &lt;username&gt;nobody&lt;/username&gt;
                    &lt;groupname&gt;nogroup&lt;/groupname&gt;
                  &lt;/server&gt;
                  &lt;verbosity&gt;5&lt;/verbosity&gt;
                &lt;/bus&gt;
                &lt;bus&gt;
                  &lt;loopback&gt;
                    &lt;number_fb&gt;3&lt;/number_fb&gt;
                  &lt;/loopback&gt;
                  &lt;use_watchdog&gt;no&lt;/use_watchdog&gt;
                  &lt;verbosity&gt;5&lt;/verbosity&gt;
                  &lt;auto_power_on&gt;yes&lt;/auto_power_on&gt;
                &lt;/bus&gt;
              &lt;/srcpd&gt;

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file for srcpd is stored in XML format.  As XML files are plain text, experienced users
       can  manipulate  such  files  with  the  help  of a text editor.  Less experienced users should select an
       external configuration tool to ensure a syntactically correct format.

       If errors occur while reading the configuration file, the daemon will send appropriate  notifications  to
       the  syslog daemon.  These messages can be watched using the syslog facility user.info.  This facility is
       usually sent to the file <u>/var/log/messages</u> (or <u><a href="file:/var/log/syslog">/var/log/syslog</a></u>).  On some  systems  the  <u>/etc/syslog.conf</u>
       may need to be edited to access the user.info facility:

           user.info     /var/adm/user-info.log

       Currently  there is no document type definition (DTD) available, to validate the format of a user created
       configuration file.

       Each configuration file must provide the following base structure:

           &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
           &lt;srcpd&gt;
           ...
           &lt;/srcpd&gt;

       Within this structure (...) the necessary buses are configured, each using a separate substructure:

           &lt;bus&gt;
           ...
           &lt;/bus&gt;
           &lt;bus&gt;
           ...
           &lt;/bus&gt;

   <b>General</b> <b>hints</b>
       The first configured bus should always be the server-bus.  Sequence and number of the following buses are
       any desired.  Numbering of each single bus is done according to the sequence in this configuration  file.
       The  server bus itself gets number 0, all following buses are numbered continuously starting with 1 up to
       a maximum limit of 20.

       Only buses that are actually used with the daemon should be filed.  Not used buses can be commented out:

           &lt;!--
           &lt;bus&gt;
           ...
           &lt;/bus&gt;
           --&gt;

       Please bear in mind in this case the numbering of the following buses will be changed accordingly.

   <b>Universal</b> <b>options</b>
       The following options are usable for all used bus sections. Universal options must be specified after bus
       specific options.

       verbosity
              Depending on this number (valid range: 0..5) the bus will tell you less  or  more  about  what  is
              happening.  The 0 value gives a minimum output.  This option is mainly used for debugging reasons.
              You   can   watch   these   messages   using   the   syslog   daemon  file  <u>/var/log/messages</u>  (or
              <u>/var/log/messages</u>); see <u><a href="../man8/srcpd.8.html">srcpd</a></u>(8) for more information.  The default value is <u>4</u>.

       use_watchdog
              Some buses provide a watchdog feature to cancel a blocked bus thread.  Valid input values are  <u>yes</u>
              or <u>no</u>.  The default value is <u>no</u>.

       restore_device_settings
              Some buses provide a feature to restore serial device settings.  Valid input values are <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>.
              The default value is <u>no</u>.

       device This  is  the  name  of  the  connected device (like /dev/ttyS0).  If bus is <b>server</b> or <b>loopback</b> no
              assignment is necessary.  The default value is <u>/dev/null</u>.

       auto_power_on
              This option enables/disables automatical power on for a bus on server daemon start.   This  option
              is not necessary for <b>server</b> and <b>loopback</b> buses.  The default value is <u>no</u>.

       speed  Buses  using  serial  devices  with a not fixed transfer speed allow one to adjust this parameter.
              Possible values are 2400, 4800, 9600,  19200,  38400,  57600  and  115200 baud.   For  buses  with
              variable interface speed the default value is <u>2400</u>.

   <b>server</b>
       This bus is needed every time.  The following options can be used for individual setup.

       tcp-port
              This  is  the  TCP/IP port for communication between <u>srcpd</u> and his clients.  Default is <u>4303</u> (this
              port number is assigned to SRCP by IANA).

       pid-file
              File, where srcpd is storing it's process-id.  According to FHS the default is <u>/var/run/srcpd.pid</u>.

       username
              srcpd runs under this user.  Default is <u>nobody</u>.

       groupname
              srcpd runs under this group.  Default is <u>nogroup</u>.

   <b>dccar</b>
       This driver supports <u>DC-Car</u> <u>Infrared</u> <u>Remote</u> <u>Control</u>.  This mode supports remote  control  of  cars  (e.g.
       Faller  Car-System)  with  a DC-Car decoder or Infracar decoder.  A sender must be connected to your PC's
       seriall port.  Some USB/Serial Adapter also work, e.g. Prolifi PL 2303 based adapter.

       A description of the sender is available at <a href="http://www.dc-car.de/pc-sender.html">http://www.dc-car.de/pc-sender.html</a>

       mode   This option specifies whether DC-Car or Infracar decoders are controlled.   Currently  it  is  not
              possible to combine both modes. Possile values are <b>dccar</b> and <b>infracar</b>.

       number_gl
              This  value  specifies  the  address  range of the used vehicles (GL).  Up to 1024 DC-Cars or 4096
              Infracars can be controlled.  Default values are <b>1024</b> (dccar) and <b>4096</b> (infracar).

       pause_between_commands
              This value specifies the time between two commands The default value is 10 ms.

       Example
              &lt;bus&gt;
                   &lt;dccar&gt;
                        &lt;mode&gt;dccar&lt;/mode&gt;
                        &lt;number_gl&gt;1024&lt;/number_gl&gt;
                        &lt;pause_between_commands&gt;10&lt;/pause_between_commands&gt;
                   &lt;/dccar&gt;
                   &lt;auto_power_on&gt;yes&lt;/auto_power_on&gt;
                   &lt;verbosity&gt;4&lt;/verbosity&gt;
                   &lt;device&gt;/dev/ttyUSB0&lt;/device&gt;
              &lt;/bus&gt;

   <b>ddl</b>
       Digital Direct for Linux (DDL) via serial line (RS232).  With this module the PC is enabled to generate a
       digital control voltage for Maerklin/Motorola (MM) and/or NMRA/DCC using  the  serial  interface  (RS232)
       hardware.   Output  lines  TxD  and  GND are used by this feature and must be connected to booster inputs
       properly.

       This module exposes optimal signal performance if special user rights for the <u>srcpd</u> are applied.   It  is
       recommended  especially  for  Maerklin/Motorola  users to configure a system user <u>srcpd</u> and a group <u>srcpd</u>
       with these command lines:

          $ addgroup --system srcpd
          $ adduser --system --no-create-home --ingroup srcpd srcpd

       In order to increase the realtime priority for this user the system file  <u><a href="file:/etc/security/limits.conf">/etc/security/limits.conf</a></u>  must
       be edited to add following line:

           srcpd  -       rtprio  99

       Additionally check if the pam_limits parameters in configuration file

           <a href="file:/etc/pam.d/su">/etc/pam.d/su</a>

       are activated, so user limits set in <a href="file:/etc/security/limits.conf">/etc/security/limits.conf</a> are effective.

       According to these measures the configuration file must be adapted as follows:

           &lt;server&gt;
             ...
             &lt;username&gt;srcpd&lt;/username&gt;
             &lt;groupname&gt;srcpd&lt;/groupname&gt;
             ...
           &lt;/server&gt;

       number_ga
              Maximum  usable  decoder  address number for generic accessory devices (GA).  The default value is
              <u>324</u>.

              please note that there is an offset of 4 between the DDL addresses and the addresses according  to
              the  documentation  from  maerklin.  The equation ddl-address = maerklin docu address + 4 is used.
              This is due to some interpretation differences what the  trits  mean.  Details  can  be  found  at
              <a href="http://vogt-it.com/OpenSource/DDL/Addrestable.html">http://vogt-it.com/OpenSource/DDL/Addrestable.html</a>

       number_gl
              Maximum  usable  decoder address number for generic locomotive devices (GL).  The default value is
              <u>81</u>.

       enable_ringindicator_checking
              The ring indicator (RI) is a line of the serial interface RS232.  This line can be used to  switch
              off  digital  signal  power,  e.g.  by pushing a connected emergency stop button.  Signal power is
              switched off if RI line input voltage changes from -12V (-5V) to +12V (+5V).  If this  feature  is
              used,  the  parameter must be set to <u>yes</u>, if not used, it must be set to <u>no</u>.  The default value is
              <u>no</u>.

       enable_checkshort_checking
              The DSR line of the serial interface RS232 can be used to switch off digital power as response  to
              shortcut  detection.  The connected booster must provide support for this kind of feature and must
              be wired to this line accordingly.  If used the parameter must be set to <u>yes</u>, if not used, it must
              be set to <u>no</u>.  The default value is <u>no</u>.

       inverse_dsr_handling
              Some boosters provide inverted output voltage for shortcut detection.  If such a booster  is  used
              this parameter must be set to <u>yes</u>.  The default value is <u>no</u>.

       enable_maerklin
              This parameter must be set to <u>yes</u>, if decoders for the old (not mfx) Maerklin/Motorola (MM) format
              are used.  If not used, it should be set to <u>no</u>.  The default value is <u>yes</u>.

       enable_nmradcc
              This  parameter  must  be  set  to <u>yes</u>, if decoders for NMRA/DCC format are used.  If not used, it
              should be set to <u>no</u>.  The default value is <u>yes</u>.

       It is also possible to enable both digital protocol formats, to drive decoders of  both  digital  systems
       attached  to  the same power line.  In order to minimize CPU load, the not used protocol should always be
       disabled.

       improve_nmradcc_timing
              The default baudrate of DDL is 19200 baud, which is slightly  higher  than  allowed  by  NMRA  DCC
              standard.   With  a  UART  16550A  you can change the baudrate to  16457 baud, which is within the
              specification.  This is only needed if you have timing problems with  the  default.   Valid  input
              values are <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>.  The default value is <b>no</b>, which corresponds to 19200 baud.

       nmra_ga_offset
              This  parameter  is  for backward compatibility to <u>erddcd</u> and alternate usage of different central
              units, due to the fact there are two ways to handle NMRA/DCC decoder  addresses.   This  parameter
              allows  one  to  add  an offset to all used address values.  E.g., if all GA decoder addresses are
              shifted by 4 (i.e. you want to change switch 1, and you have to change switch 5 to do this),  then
              this parameter should be set to <u>1</u>.  Valid values are 0 and 1.  Default value is <u>0</u>.

       shortcut_failure_delay
              Number  of  micro  seconds  <u>srcpd</u> waits to switch off digital power, after a shortcut is detected.
              The default value is <u>0</u>.

       nmradcc_translation_routine
              There are 3 implementations for converting the logical command bits  into  serial  line  commands,
              considering  the  start  and  stop bits of the serial line.  Valid values are 1, 2 and 3.  Default
              value is <u>3</u>.

       enable_usleep_patch
              Due to certain issues of the MM protocol its usage results in a significant amount of CPU load for
              <u>srcpd</u>, caused by busy waiting.  This parameter gives the possibility to improve this situation  by
              introducing  a  process wait state for a certain amount of time.  Normally this does not result in
              any trouble controlling the attached decoders, so the parameter  should  be  set  to  <u>yes</u>.   Valid
              values are <u>yes</u> and <u>no</u>.  The default value is <u>yes</u>.

       usleep_usec
              Number  of  micro  seconds the signal generating process pauses.  This value should be as small as
              possible; a bigger value can result in improper digital signal generation.  There have  been  good
              results   using   values   between   100   and  250  usecs.   This  parameter  is  only  used,  if
              <u>enable_usleep_patch</u> is set to <u>yes</u>.  The default value is <u>100</u>.

       program_track
              This parameter allows you to suppress commands  which  are  issued  for  a  program  track.   This
              parameter  should only be used on your main.  Valid input values are <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>.  The default value
              is <b>yes</b>, i.e. all program track commands will be executed by default.

       Example Maerklin/Motorola
              &lt;bus&gt;
                  &lt;ddl&gt;
                     &lt;number_ga&gt;200&lt;/number_ga&gt;
                     &lt;number_gl&gt;81&lt;/number_gl&gt;
                     &lt;enable_maerklin&gt;yes&lt;/enable_maerklin&gt;
                     &lt;enable_nmradcc&gt;no&lt;/enable_nmradcc&gt;
                     &lt;enable_usleep_patch&gt;yes&lt;/enable_usleep_patch&gt;
                     &lt;usleep_usec&gt;200&lt;/usleep_usec&gt;
                  &lt;/ddl&gt;
                  &lt;auto_power_on&gt;no&lt;/auto_power_on&gt;
                  &lt;verbosity&gt;4&lt;/verbosity&gt;
                  &lt;device&gt;/dev/ttyS0&lt;/device&gt;
              &lt;/bus&gt;

       Example NMRA/DCC
              &lt;bus&gt;
                  &lt;ddl&gt;
                     &lt;number_ga&gt;160&lt;/number_ga&gt;
                     &lt;number_gl&gt;60&lt;/number_gl&gt;
                     &lt;enable_maerklin&gt;no&lt;/enable_maerklin&gt;
                     &lt;enable_nmradcc&gt;yes&lt;/enable_nmradcc&gt;
                     &lt;nmradcc_translation_routine&gt;3&lt;/nmradcc_translation_routine&gt;
                  &lt;/ddl&gt;
                  &lt;auto_power_on&gt;no&lt;/auto_power_on&gt;
                  &lt;verbosity&gt;4&lt;/verbosity&gt;
                  &lt;device&gt;/dev/ttyS0&lt;/device&gt;
              &lt;/bus&gt;

   <b>ddl-s88</b>
       Digital Direct for Linux S88 via parport (IEEE 1284).  This bus  provides  up  to  four  S88  data  links
       attached  to  the  parallel  port  to connect S88-feedback modules.  Usage of one S88 line is possible by
       simply wiring modules to the parallel port connectors; for advanced applications involving more than  one
       line  the  wiring  scheme  is  equivalent  to  the  one  from  the  DDL  daemon  <u>erddcd</u> (<a href="http://www.vogt">http://www.vogt</a>-
       it.com/OpenSource/DDL) as shown in the circuit of Martin Wolf.  The four S88 data links  are  managed  as
       separate buses.

       The  maximum  count of modules (with 16 contacts) which can be connected to a data link is 31; so maximal
       496 contacts are supported per link.  When using modules with 8 contacts two modules count as one.

       For each data link a separate bus is initialized where the sequence  of  the  feedback  contacts  of  the
       modules  is  increasing as the modules are connected to the data link.  If there are no modules connected
       to a data link the respective value  of  <u>number_fb_x</u>  must  be  set  to  <u>0</u>.   Nevertheless  this  bus  is
       initialized, that means also if only one bus is used, all four buses are initialized.

       ioport Input/output address of the printer port.  The default value is <u>0x0378</u>.  The value for <u>ioport</u> must
              be  given  in  hexadecimal format (starting with 0x).  Valid values for a typical Linux system are
              0x0378, 0x0278 and 0x03BC.  The right value can easily be detected searching  through  the  kernel
              start-up messages:
                  dmesg | grep parport

       clockscale
              Parameter  to  adjust the clock rate for reading the modules.  In the case of the default value 35
              the original S88 clock rate of approximately 8 KHz would be achieved.  Smaller  values  increasing
              the  clock rate but not each module can work with this.  In maximum there is approximately 125 KHz
              possible.

       refresh
              Delay time in milliseconds after witch the feedback modules  are  read  again.   In  case  of  the
              default value 100 the data is refreshed each 100 ms.

              The  higher  this value the less often the attached modules are read and the less is the resulting
              system load.  Useful values are between 100 and 250.

       fb_delay_time_0
              This value in milliseconds determines how long the signal on a feedback contact must  be  on  zero
              level before it is accepted as valid and will be forwarded to all clients.  With this parameter it
              is in a limited range possible to debounce bad feedback contacts (bouncing contacts).  The default
              value is <u>0</u>.

       number_fb_1
              This statement defines the count of feedback modules connected to the data link number <u>1</u>.

       number_fb_2
              This statement defines the count of to data link number <u>2</u> connected feedback modules.

       number_fb_3
              This statement defines the count of to data link number <u>3</u> connected feedback modules.

       number_fb_4
              This statement defines the count of to the data link number <u>4</u> connected feedback modules.

       Inside of the configuration the common values should be arranged before the bus specific values.

   <b>hsi-88</b>
       This  driver  supports  the  HSI-88  device  from  Littfinski  connected  via serial line.  An USB2Serial
       converter should work fine.  The serial line speed setting is fixed to 9600 baud and cannot be changed.

       The HSI-88 device provides three lines for feedback modules.  To each line a maximum of 31 modules  (each
       with 16 inputs) can be attached.  If modules with 8 inputs are used, two modules count as one.

       number_fb_left
              This value is the number of feedback-modules (with 16 inputs) connected to the line called <u>left</u>.

       number_fb_center
              This value is number of feedback-modules (with 16 inputs) connected to the line called <u>center</u>.

       number_fb_right
              This value is number of feedback-modules (with 16 inputs) connected to the line called <u>right</u>.

       fb_delay_time_0
              This  is  the  time in milliseconds a feedback input must be zero, before zero is delivered to the
              attaches SRCP clients.  With this feature it is possible to compensate bad feedback bounces  in  a
              certain range.  The default value is <u>0</u>.

       refresh
              The time in microseconds (us) after srcpd will read feedback again from HSI-88.  The default value
              is 10000 us.  The lower this value the higher the resulting CPU load.

       Example
              &lt;bus&gt;
                  &lt;hsi-88&gt;
                      &lt;number_fb_left&gt;8&lt;/number_fb_left&gt;

   <b>intellibox</b>
       This driver supports the Intellibox device from Uhlenbrock (IB) connected  via  the  serial  port.   Only
       extended  mode  commands  are  used (P50X binary protocol); this should be taken into account if protocol
       compatible devices (e.g. OpenDCC, DiCoStation, EasyControl) are used.  Programming decoders is  currently
       implemented  for  DCC  only.   Possible  values  for  speed  of serial port are depending from device and
       interface type 2400 baud, 4800 baud, 9600 baud, 19200 baud, 38400 bau and 57600 baud.

       fb_delay_time_0
              This is the time in milliseconds a feedback input must be zero, before this value is delivered  to
              clients.   With  this  feature  you  can compensate bad feedback in a specific range.  The default
              value is 0 ms.

       pause_between_commands
              This is the time in milliseconds between two commands the  driver  must  wait.   The  exact  value
              should  be  hand  tuned.   If  the  system does not respond or drops commands try to increase this
              value.  Default is 250 ms.

       number_ga
              This is the maximal address number  of  Generic  Accessory  decoders  (GA).   Supported  range  is
              0..1024.  A value of 0 means no GA available.  Default is 256.

       number_gl
              Like  the  number  of GA this number limits the maximum address of the Generic Locomotive decoders
              (GL).  Supported range is 0..10239.  A value of 0 means no GL available.  Default is 80.

       number_fb
              This is the number of S88 modules attached to the Intellibox device.  The maximum valid number  is
              31.   The  default  is  0  (no  modules  are attached).  Please note that Loconet is currently not
              supported.

       auto_speed_detection
              This option activates an automatical baudrate detection of the connected Intellibox  (BABI,  Break
              and  Automatic  Baud-rate Identification).  This procedure takes several seconds but if enabled it
              is not necessary to specify  a  value  for  the  <u>speed</u>  parameter.   If  disabled  the  connection
              initialization  is  much  faster  but  the  given <u>speed</u> value must comply to the actual Intellibox
              setting.  Valid values are <u>yes</u> and <u>no</u>.  The default value is <u>yes</u>.

       Example
              &lt;bus&gt;
                  &lt;intellibox&gt;
                      &lt;number_ga&gt;250&lt;/number_ga&gt;

   <b>li100,</b> <b>li100usb</b>
       This driver connects with the LI100, LI100F, LI101F or LI-USB devices from Lenz connected via the  serial
       port/USB-interface.   An USB2Serial converter should not be used.  The serial line settings are depending
       on type of interface.  For LI-USB it's fixed to 57600 baud with no chance to  change.   Autodetection  of
       serial  port  interface speed is currently under construction.  If connection fails, try restart of srcpd
       with another speed.  Possible values are 9600 baud, 19200 baud, 38400 baud, 57600 baud  and  115200 baud,
       depending on your interface.

       fb_delay_time_0
              This is the time in milliseconds an feedback input must be zero, before this value is delivered to
              clients.   With  this  feature  you  can compensate bad feedback in a specific range.  The default
              value is 0 ms.

       number_ga
              This is the number of GA.  Supported range is 0..1024.  A  value  of  0  means  no  GA  available.
              Default is 99 (LI-USB 9999).

       number_gl
              Like the number of GA this number gives the maximum address.  Supported range is 0..9999.  A value
              of 0 means no GL available.  Default is 99 (LI-USB 9999).

       number_fb
              This  is  the  number of RS modules attached to the Lenz device.  It can be as large as 512.  It's
              assumed, that one module has 8 inputs.  A value of 0 means no FB available.  Default is  256  (LI-
              USB 512).

       For  Lenz  USB  interfaces It is very important to have the kernel module <u>ftdi_sio</u> available.  Due to the
       Lenz concept, the interface unit returns different values after start.

   <b>loconet</b>
       This  bus provides a driver for the Loconet system by Digitrax.  The device settings may be either serial

   <b>loopback</b>
       This bus does not connect to real hardware.  It is used primarily for development tasks but may be useful
       for real installations too.  Every command on this bus  does  only  have  an  echo  effect  on  the  INFO
       sessions.  This device may be used as virtual device for communication tasks.

       number_ga
              This is the maximal address number of Generic Accessory (GA) devices.  Default is 256.

       number_gl
              This  number  gives  the  maximum  valid  address  number  of the Generic Locomotive (GL) devices.
              Default is 80

       number_fb
              Different to other buses this parameter takes  the  number  of  feedback  contacts,  not  modules.
              Simulation  of  two  feedback  modules,  each providing 16 contacts, accordingly needs a parameter
              value of 32.  Default is 0 (no contact).

       Example
              &lt;bus&gt;

   <b>m605x</b>
       This supports communication with the 6051 or 6050 devices from Maerklin connected via  the  serial  port.
       An USB2Serial converter should work fine.  The serial line settings are fixed to 2400 baud 8N2 and cannot
       be changed.

       m6020mode
              In  this  mode the srcpd does not sent the 4 functions.  This is a feature of the 6021 only. Valid
              values are <u>yes</u> and <u>no</u>.  Default value is <u>no.</u>

       fb_delay_time_0
              This is the time the driver code waits until it recognized the input change in milliseconds.  This
              feature may support a debounce found in the hardware.  The default value is 0 ms.

       ga_min_activetime
              The time in milliseconds a GA device needs to be in active state.  The absolute minimum  is  75 ms
              and is needed for stable communication with the 6051.  The default value is 75 ms.

       pause_between_commands
              This  is  the  time  between  two commands the drivers must wait.  The exact values should be hand
              tuned.  If the system does not respond or drops commands try to increase this value.   Default  is
              200 ms.

       pause_between_bytes
              This  is the time the driver waits between 2 bytes in multi-byte commands.  The hardware handshake
              does not work with all devices so this parameter was introduced to support  it.   The  default  is
              2 ms.

       number_ga
              This is the number of GA.  This parameter does not have a real effect since the interface supports
              the addresses 1..256 only.  Keep the default value 256 untouched.

       number_gl
              Like  the  number of GA this number gives the maximum GL address.  Since this number is limited to
              80, keep the default value 80 untouched.

       number_fb
              This is the number of 6088 modules attached to the 6051/6050 device.   The  valid  range  is  from
              0..31.   The default value is 0 (no modules are attached).  Please note that 6088 modules attached
              to other devices (memory) cannot be accessed.

       Example
