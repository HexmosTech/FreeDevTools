</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hare-module - Hare module layout

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Hare  modules  are represented as directories in the filesystem. A directory is a valid Hare module if it
       contains at least one Hare source file (with the file extension <b>.ha</b>), or if  it  contains  a  file  named
       <b>README</b>.

       All  files which end in <b>.ha</b>, <b>.s</b>, and <b>.o</b> are treated as inputs to the module, and are respectively treated
       as Hare sources, assembly sources, and objects to be linked into the final binary.

       The list of files considered eligible may be filtered by build tags (see <b>BUILD</b> <b>TAGS</b>  below).  The  format
       for  the filename is <u>name</u>[<u>tagset</u>].<u>ext</u>, where the <u>name</u> is user-defined, the <u>ext</u> is either <b>ha</b>, <b>s</b>, or <b>o</b>, and
       a tagset (see <b>BUILD</b> <b>TAGS</b>) is optionally provided after the name. A file will only be included if all tags
       included (with +) in the tagset are present, and no tags excluded (with -) in the tagset are present.

       Only one file for a given combination of <u>name</u> and <u>ext</u> will be selected for the build; the  file  selected
       is the one with the most tag specifiers. If there are two or more such files, the build driver will error
       out.

       For example, if the following files are present in a directory:

       •   foo.ha
       •   bar.ha
       •   bar+linux.ha
       •   bar+plan9.ha
       •   baz+x86_64.s
       •   bat-x86_64.ha

       If  the  build  tags  are  +linux+x86_64,  then  the  files  which are included in the module are foo.ha,
       bar+linux.ha, and baz+x86_64.s. If the following files are added:

       •   meep+linux-libc.ha
       •   meep+linux+x86_64.ha

       then the build driver will error out, unless +libc is added to the build tags.

       Additionally, subdirectories in a module will be considered part of that module if  their  name  consists
       only  of  a  tagset, e.g. "+linux" or "-x86_64". A directory with only a name (but without a tagset, e.g.
       "example") is considered a submodule, and as such must be imported separately.  For  example,  "foo::bar"
       refers  to  foo/bar/.  If a directory name contains both a name and a tagset, the build driver will error
       out.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCY</b> <b>RESOLUTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "use" directives in each Hare source file used as an input to <b><a href="../man1/hare-build.1.html">hare-build</a></b>(1),  <b><a href="../man1/hare-run.1.html">hare-run</a></b>(1),  or  <b><a href="../man1/haretest.1.html">hare-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man1/haretest.1.html">test</a></b>(1)  are  scanned  and used to determine the dependencies for a program. This process is repeated for
       each dependency to obtain a complete dependency tree.

       Dependencies are searched for by examining first the current working directory, then  each  component  of
       the  <b>HAREPATH</b>,  which  is  a list of paths separated by colons. <b>HAREPATH</b> is obtained from the environment
       variable of the same name. If the environment variable is unset, a default value is used,  which  can  be
       viewed with the <b>hare</b> <b>version</b> <b>-v</b> command. Typically, it is set to include the path to the standard library
       installed  on the system, as well as a system-provided location for third-party modules installed via the
       system package manager.

       <b><a href="../man1/hare-deps.1.html">hare-deps</a></b>(1) may be used to print the dependency tree of a Hare module.

</pre><h4><b>BUILD</b> <b>TAGS</b></h4><pre>
       Build tags allow you to add constraints on what features or platforms are enabled for your build.  A  tag
       is  a  name,  consisting  of  characters which aren't any of '+', '-', or '.', and a '+' or '-' prefix to
       signal inclusivity or exclusivity.

       To add or remove build tags, use the <b>-T</b> flag. For example, <b>-T</b> <b>+foo-bar</b> will add the 'foo' tag and  remove
       the 'bar' tag.

       Some  tags  are  enabled  by  default,  enabling features for the host platform. You can view the default
       tagset by running <b>hare</b> <b>version</b> <b>-v</b>. To remove all default tags, use <b>-T^</b>.
