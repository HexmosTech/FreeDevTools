</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If  a  package  directory contains a file with the fixed name "META" it is interpreted as described here.
       The file is a sequence of entries following the given grammar; every entry defines  a  variable  under  a
       certain condition given by the list of formal predicates, or it introduces a subpackage.

       There  is  a  list  of  predefined  variables  and a list of standard predicates. These variables define:
       required packages, description, version information, directories, archive files, and linker options.  The
       predicates  denote  circumstances of the application of the variables: whether the bytecode or the native
       compiler is used, if there is a toploop compiled in, details of  multi-threading  execution,  details  of
       profiling.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The  file  consists  of a sequence of entries which must be formed as the grammar prescribes. The lexical
       tokens are names, values, and interpunctuation like '(', ',' and so on. Note that linefeeds do not play a
       special role, i.e. an entry definition may be given in more than one line,  or  several  definitions  may
       occur on a single line. There may be comments which begin with '#' and run until the end of the line.

       Names  are  sequences  of  the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _. Names containing capital letters and names
       beginning with digits are allowed but not recommended.

       Values are enclosed between double quotes. Values may contain any character. The characters " and \  must
       be preceded by backslashes.

       Package names must not contain the '.' character because it is used as delimiter of compound names.

</pre><h4><b>MAIN</b> <b>PACKAGES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SUBPACKAGES</b></h4><pre>
       The outermost variable assignments and additions belong to the main package. The name of the main package
       is  not  defined within META; it is either the name of the directory containing META or the suffix of the
       META file (if the name of the META file is formed like META.name).

       The keyword package starts the definition of a subpackage. There must not be two  such  definitions  with
       the same name. Within the parentheses, the variable assignments and additions refer to the subpackage. It
       is allowed that a subpackage contains further subpackages.

       The  package  name following package is the local name relative to the main package, i.e. the name of the
       main package is not mentioned. At all other places, however, the subpackage must be prefixed by the  name
       of the containing package, separated by a '.'.

       Subpackages  are  independent  of  the  containing package, except that the subpackage points to the same
       installation directory as the containing package (i.e. the location  of  the  installation  directory  is
       inherited from the containing package).

</pre><h4><b>SEMANTICS</b> <b>OF</b> <b>VARIABLE</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In order to determine the value of a variable, first all assignments are inspected, and the most specific
       assignment  is  taken  (if there is none, the empty string will be taken as value). In a second step, all
       additions are gone through one after the other in the order they occur in the file, and the values of all
       matching additions are appended to the current value. In the following, it  is  further  clarified  which
       assignment  is  the  most  specific,  which  additions  actually  match, and how the details of the value
       addition look like.

       The most specific assignment is selected upon a set of actual predicates, i.e. the set of predicates that
       are assumed to be true. The predicates occurring in the definitions  of  assignments  and  additions  are
       called  formal  predicates.  They may be positive or negative; the latter are prepended by a '-' sign. In
       order to determine the value after the evaluation of the assignments, the following rules apply:

           •  An assignment can only be used if all positive formal predicates are included in the set of actual
              predicates, and if all  negative  formal  predicates  are  not  included  in  the  set  of  actual
              predicates.  Such an assignment is called <b>applicable</b>. If there is no such assignment, the variable
              will have no value.

           •  If there is more than one applicable assignment, the definition with the biggest number of  formal
              predicates is selected.

           •  If  there is still more than one applicable assignment, both applicable  and with a maximum number
              of formal predicates, the definition that is defined first is selected.

       An addition is matching when all positive formal predicates are included in the set of actual predicates,
       and all negative formal predicates are not included.

       The value of an addition is appended to the current value with implicit white space as separator.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       There is a set of variables with predefined meaning:

           •  The variable "directory" redefines the location of the package directory. Normally, the META  file
              is  the  first  file  read  in  the  package  directory,  and  before  any other file is read, the
              "directory" variable is evaluated in order to see if the package directory must  be  changed.  The
              value  of the "directory" variable is determined with an empty set of actual predicates. The value
              must be either: an absolute path name of the alternate directory, or a path name relative  to  the
              stdlib  directory  of  OCaml  (written  "+path"),  or a normal relative path name (without special
              syntax). In the latter case, the interpretation depends on whether it is contained in  a  main  or
              sub  package, and whether the standard repository layout or the alternate layout is in effect (see
              site-lib for these terms). For a main package  in  standard  layout  the  base  directory  is  the
              directory  physically containing the META file, and the relative path is interpreted for this base
              directory. For a main package in alternate layout the base directory is the  directory  physically
              containing  the META.pkg files. The base directory for subpackages is the package directory of the
              containing package. (In the case that a subpackage definition does not have a "directory" setting,
              the subpackage simply inherits the package directory of  the  containing  package.  By  writing  a
              "directory" directive one can change this location again.)

           •  The variable "requires" specifies the list of required packages. The names of the packages must be
              separated by white space and/or commas. The names must be fully qualified (i.e. when they refer to
              a subpackage, the names of all containing packages must be prepended, separated by '.').

           •  The  variable "description" may include a short description of the package (displayed by ocamlfind
              list).

           •  The variable "version" specifies the version string.

           •  The variable "archive" specifies the list of archive files. These files should be given either  as
              (1)  plain  names  without  any  directory  information;  they  are  only  searched in the package
              directory. (2) Or they have the form "+path" in which case the files are looked up relative to the
              standard library. (3) Or they have the form "@name/file" in which case the files are looked up  in
              the package directory of another package. (4) Or they are given as absolute paths.

              The  names of the files must be separated by white space and/or commas. In the preprocessor stage,
              the archive files are passed as extensions to the preprocessor (camlp4) call. In the linker  stage
              (-linkpkg), the archive files are linked. In the compiler stage, the archive files are ignored.

              Note  that  "archive"  should  only  be used for archive files that are intended to be included in
              executables or loaded into toploops. For modules loaded at runtime there is the separate  variable
              "plugin".

           •  The  variable  "plugin"  specifies  the  plugin  archives of the package. These can be dynamically
              loaded with the Fl_dynload module. The plugin archives can have ".cmo", ".cma", or ".cmxs" suffix.

           •  The variable "linkopts" specifies additional linker options.

           •  The variable "error" can be used to signal error conditions. When this variable is applicable, the
              ocaml compilers are stopped, and an error message is printed. The message  is  the  value  of  the
              variable.

           •  The  variable  "warning"  can  be  used  to signal warnings. When this variable is applicable, the
              warning is printed, but the compilation continues. The message is the value of the variable.

           •  The variable "exists_if" can be used to disable subpackages. The value of "exists_if" is  a  file;
              the  subpackage  is  hidden if this file does not exist. You can also enumerate several files, and
              the subpackage is hidden if none of the files exist.

           •  The variable "ppx" is a command that is added to the  compiler  invocation  via  the  -ppx  option
              (available  since  OCaml-4.01).  If the command is relative to the current directory (e.g. ./cmd),
              the command is expected in the package directory. The special forms as defined for  "archive"  are
              also  available  (e.g.  @otherpkg/cmd).  Additional  arguments  can  be specified on the ocamlfind
              command line with the -ppxopt option or the "ppxopt" variable.

           •  The variable "ppxopt" is a set of options that are added  to  the  ppx  rewriter  invocation.  The
              contents  of  the  variable  consists  of  one  or  several whitespace-separated parts. Every part
              consists of several comma-separated  subparts;  the  first  subpart  indicates  the  package  that
              contains  the  ppx rewriter invocation, the rest contain the options to be appended. If the option
              is a path relative to the current directory (e.g. ./foo.cma), the path is expanded relative to the
              package  directory.  The  special  forms  as  defined  for  "archive"  are  also  available  (e.g.
              @otherpkg/foo.cma).

       It is possible to define additional variables but there is currently no software interpreting them.

</pre><h4><b>PREDICATES</b></h4><pre>
       There is a list of standard predicates:

           •  The "byte" predicate means that the bytecode compiler is used.

           •  The "native" predicate means that the native compiler is used.

           •  The  "toploop" predicate means that the toploop is available in the linked program. It is only set
              when the toploop is running, not when the toploop is generated.

           •  The "create_toploop" predicate means that a toploop is created (using ocamlmktop).

           •  The "mt" predicate means that the program is multi-threaded.

           •  The "mt_posix" predicate means that in the case "mt" is set, too, the POSIX libraries are used  to
              implement threads.

           •  The  "mt_vm" predicate means that in the case "mt" is set, too, the VM-based libraries are used to
              implement threads.

           •  The "gprof" predicate means that in the case "native" is set, too, the  program  is  compiled  for
              profiling

           •  The "autolink" predicate means that ocamlc can/will perform automatic linking.

           •  The "preprocessor" predicate means that the META variables are scanned for preprocessor options.

           •  The "syntax" predicate means that the -syntax option is present on the command line.

           •  Legacy:  The  "plugin" predicate could be used in some versions of findlib to select cmxs archives
              instead of cmxa archives. This use is still possible but discouraged.

       In addition to these predicates, there are package predicates for every package that is finally selected.
       Of course, this kind of predicate must not be used to select "directory" and  "requires"  variables,  but
       for  the  other  variables they are perfectly valid. The package predicates have the form "pkg_" plus the
       name of the package (fully qualified).
