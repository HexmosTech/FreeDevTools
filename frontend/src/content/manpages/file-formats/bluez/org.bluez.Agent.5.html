       org.bluez.Agent - BlueZ D-Bus Agent API documentation

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Service</b>
              unique name

       <b>Interface</b>
              org.bluez.Agent1

       <b>Object</b> <b>path</b>
              freely definable

   <b>Methods</b>
   <b>void</b> <b>Release()</b>
          This  method  gets  called  when  the service daemon unregisters the agent.  An agent can use it to do
          cleanup tasks. There is no need to unregister the agent, because when this method gets called  it  has
          already been unregistered.

   <b>string</b> <b>RequestPinCode(object</b> <b>device)</b>
          This method gets called when the service daemon needs to get the passkey for an authentication.

          The return value should be a string of 1-16 characters length. The string can be alphanumeric.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Rejected</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Canceled</b>

   <b>void</b> <b>DisplayPinCode(object</b> <b>device,</b> <b>string</b> <b>pincode)</b>
          This method gets called when the service daemon needs to display a pincode for an authentication.

          An empty reply should be returned. When the pincode needs no longer to be displayed, the Cancel method
          of the agent will be called.

          This  is  used  during the pairing process of keyboards that don't support Bluetooth 2.1 Secure Simple
          Pairing, in contrast to DisplayPasskey which is used for those that do.

          This method will only ever be called once since older keyboards do not support typing notification.

          Note that the PIN will always be a 6-digit number, zero-padded to 6 digits. This is for  harmony  with
          the later specification.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Rejected</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Canceled</b>

   <b>uint32</b> <b>RequestPasskey(object</b> <b>device)</b>
          This method gets called when the service daemon needs to get the passkey for an authentication.

          The return value should be a numeric value between 0-999999.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Rejected</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Canceled</b>

   <b>void</b> <b>DisplayPasskey(object</b> <b>device,</b> <b>uint32</b> <b>passkey,</b> <b>uint16</b> <b>entered)</b>
          This method gets called when the service daemon needs to display a passkey for an authentication.

          The entered parameter indicates the number of already typed keys on the remote side.

          An empty reply should be returned. When the passkey needs no longer to be displayed, the Cancel method
          of the agent will be called.

          During the pairing process this method might be called multiple times to update the entered value.

          Note  that  the  passkey  will always be a 6-digit number, so the display should be zero-padded at the
          start if the value contains less than 6 digits.

   <b>void</b> <b>RequestConfirmation(object</b> <b>device,</b> <b>uint32</b> <b>passkey)</b>
          This method gets called when the service daemon needs to confirm a passkey for an authentication.

          To confirm the value it should return an empty reply or an error in case the passkey is invalid.

          Note that the passkey will always be a 6-digit number, so the display should  be  zero-padded  at  the
          start if the value contains less than 6 digits.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Rejected</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Canceled</b>

   <b>void</b> <b>RequestAuthorization(object</b> <b>device)</b>
          This  method  gets  called to request the user to authorize an incoming pairing attempt which would in
          other circumstances trigger the just-works model, or when the user plugged in a device that implements
          cable pairing. In the latter case, the device would not be connected to the adapter via Bluetooth yet.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Rejected</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Canceled</b>

   <b>void</b> <b>AuthorizeService(object</b> <b>device,</b> <b>string</b> <b>uuid)</b>
          This method gets called when the service daemon needs to authorize a connection/service request.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Rejected</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Canceled</b>

   <b>void</b> <b>Cancel()</b>
          This method gets called to indicate that the agent request failed before a reply was returned.
