       barman - Barman Configurations

       Barman  follows a convention over configuration approach, which simplifies configuration by allowing some
       options to be defined globally and overridden at the server level. This  means  you  can  set  a  default
       behavior for your servers and then customize specific servers as needed. This design reduces the need for
       excessive configuration while maintaining flexibility.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Proper   configuration  is  critical  for  its  effective  operation.  Barman  uses  different  types  of
       configuration files to manage global settings, server-specific settings, and model-specific settings that
       is made up of three scopes:

       1. <b>Global</b> <b>Configuration</b>: It comprises one file with a set of configurations for the barman  system,  such
       as  the  main  directory,  system  user,  log  file,  and  other  general  options.  Default  location is
       <b>/etc/barman.conf</b> and it can be overridden on a per-user level by <b><a href="file:~/.barman.conf">~/.barman.conf</a></b> or by specifying a  <b>.conf</b>
       file using the <b>-c</b> / <b>--config</b> with the <u>barman</u> <u>command</u> directly in the CLI.

       2.  <b>Server</b>  <b>Configuration</b>:  It  comprises  one  or more files with a set of configurations for a Postgres
       server that you want to keep track and interact for backup, recovery and/or replication. Default location
       is <b>/etc/barman.d</b> and must use the <b>.conf</b> suffix. You may have one or multiple files for servers.  You  can
       override  the  default  location  by  setting  the  <b>configuration_files_directory</b>  option  in  the global
       configuration file and placing the files in that particular location.

       3. <b>Model</b> <b>Configuration</b>: It comprises one or more files with a set of configurations overrides that can be
       applied to Barman servers within the same cluster as the model. These overrides can be implemented  using
       the  barman  <b>config-switch</b> command.  Default location is <b>/etc/barman.d</b> and must use the <b>.conf</b> suffix. The
       same <b>configuration_files_directory</b> override option from the server configuration applies for models.  You
       may have one or multiple files for models.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Historically, you could have a single configuration file containing global, server, and model options,
          but, for maintenance reasons, this approach is deprecated.

       Configuration  files follow the <b>INI</b> format and consist of sections denoted by headers in square brackets.
       Each section can include various options.

       Models and servers must have unique identifiers, and reserved words cannot be used as names.

       <b>Reserved</b> <b>Words</b>

       The following reserved words cannot be used as server or model names:

       • <b>barman</b>: Identifies the global section.

       • <b>all</b>: A special shortcut for executing commands on all managed servers.

       <b>Parameter</b> <b>Types</b>

       Configuration options can be of the following types:

       • <b>String</b>: Textual data (e.g., file paths, names).

       • <b>Enum</b>: Enumerated values, often limited to predefined choices.

       • <b>Integer</b>: Numeric values.

       • <b>Boolean</b>: Can be <b>on</b>, <b>true</b>, <b>1</b> (true) or <b>off</b>, <b>false</b>, <b>0</b> (false).

         <b>NOTE:</b>
            Some enums allow <b>off</b>, but not <b>false</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options in the configuration files can have  specific  or  shared  scopes.  The  following  configuration
       options  are  used  not only for configuring how Barman will execute backups and recoveries, but also for
       configuring various aspects of how Barman interacts with the configured Postgres servers to  be  able  to
       apply your Backup and Recovery, and High-Availability strategies.

   <b>General</b>
       These are general configurations options.

       <b>active</b>

       When  this  option  is  set  to <b>true</b> (default), the server operates fully. If set to <b>false</b>, the server is
       restricted to diagnostic use only, meaning that operational commands such  as  backup  execution  or  WAL
       archiving  are  temporarily disabled. When incorporating a new server into Barman, we recommend initially
       setting <b>active</b> <b>=</b> <b>false</b>. Verify that barman check shows no  issues  before  activating  the  server.  This
       approach helps prevent excessive error logging in Barman during the initial setup.

       Scope: Server / Model.

       <b>archiver</b>

       This  option  enables log file shipping through Postgres' <b>archive_command</b> for a server. When set to <b>true</b>,
       Barman expects continuous archiving to be configured and will manage WAL files that  Postgres  stores  in
       the incoming directory (<b>incoming_wals_directory</b>), including their checks, handling, and compression. When
       set to <b>false</b> (default), continuous archiving is disabled.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          If neither <b>archiver</b> nor <b>streaming_archiver</b> is configured, Barman will automatically set this option to
          <b>true</b>  to  maintain  compatibility  with  the  previous default behavior where archiving was enabled by
          default.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>archiver_batch_size</b>

       This option enables batch processing of WAL files for the archiver process  by  setting  it  to  a  value
       greater  than <b>0</b>. If not set, the archiver will use unlimited (default) processing mode for the WAL queue.
       With batch processing enabled, the archiver process will handle  a  maximum  of  <b>archiver_batch_size</b>  WAL
       segments per run. This value must be an integer.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>bandwidth_limit</b>

       Specifies  the  maximum transfer rate in kilobytes per second for backup and recovery operations. A value
       of <b>0</b> indicates no limit (default).

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Applies only when <b>backup_method</b> <b>=</b> <b>postgres</b> <b>|</b> <b>rsync</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>barman_home</b>

       Designates the main data directory for Barman. Defaults to <b>/var/lib/barman</b>.

       Scope: Global.

       <b>barman_lock_directory</b>

       Specifies the directory for lock files. The default is <b>barman_home</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The <b>barman_lock_directory</b> should be on a non-network local filesystem.

       Scope: Global.

       <b>check_timeout</b>

       Sets the maximum execution time in seconds for a Barman check command per server. Set to <b>0</b> to disable the
       timeout. Default is <b>30</b> seconds. Must be a non-negative integer.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>cluster</b>

       Tag the server or model to  an  associated  cluster  name.  Barman  uses  this  association  to  override
       configuration for all servers/models in this cluster. If omitted for servers, it defaults to the server's
       name.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Must be specified for configuration models to group applicable servers.

       Scope: Server / Model.

       <b>config_changes_queue</b>

       Designates  the  filesystem  location for Barman's queue that handles configuration changes requested via
       the barman <b>config-update</b> command. This queue manages the serialization and retry of configuration  change
       requests. By default, Barman writes to a file named <b>cfg_changes.queue</b> under <b>barman_home</b>.

       Scope: Global.

       <b>configuration_files_directory</b>

       Designates  the  directory  where  server/model  configuration files will be read by Barman.  Defaults to
       <b>/etc/barman.d/</b>.

       Scope: Global.

       <b>conninfo</b>

       Specifies the connection string used by Barman to connect to  the  Postgres  server.   This  is  a  libpq
       connection string. Commonly used keys include: <b>host</b>, <b>hostaddr</b>, <b>port</b>, <b>dbname</b>, <b>user</b> and <b>password</b>. See the ‐
       <u>PostgreSQL</u> <u>documentation</u> for details.

       Scope: Server / Model.

       <b>create_slot</b>

       Determines  whether Barman should automatically create a replication slot if it's not already present for
       streaming WAL files. When set to <b>auto</b> and <b>slot_name</b> is defined, Barman will attempt to  create  the  slot
       automatically. When set to <b>manual</b> (default), the replication slot must be created manually.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>description</b>

       Provides a human-readable description of a server.

       Scope: Server / Model.

       <b>errors_directory</b>

       The  directory where WAL files that were errored while being archived by Barman are stored. This includes
       duplicate WAL files (e.g., an archived WAL file that has already been streamed but have  different  hash)
       and unexpected files found in the WAL archive directory.

       The  purpose  of placing the files in this directory is so someone can later review why they failed to be
       archived and take appropriate actions (dispose of, store  somewhere  else,  replace  the  duplicate  file
       archived before, etc.)

       Scope: Server.

       <b>encryption</b>

       Specifies the encryption method used for encrypting backups and WAL files. Supported values are:

       • <b>none</b> (default): No encryption is applied.

       • <b>gpg</b>: Uses <u>GPG</u> for encryption. Requires <u>GPG</u> to be installed and properly configured on the system.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>encryption_key_id</b>

       Specifies  the  encryption key ID used for encrypting backups and WAL files. This option is required when
       <b>encryption</b> <b>=</b> <b>gpg</b> and must correspond to a valid <u>GPG</u> key ID available on the system.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>encryption_passphrase_command</b>

       Specifies a command used to retrieve the encryption passphrase for decrypting backups and WAL files.  The
       command must write the passphrase to standard output.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>forward_config_path</b>

       Determines  whether  a passive node should forward its configuration file path to its primary node during
       <b>cron</b> or <b>sync-info</b> commands. Set to <b>true</b> if Barman is invoked with  the  <b>-c</b>  /  <b>--config</b>  option  and  the
       configuration paths are identical on both passive and primary Barman servers. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>immediate_checkpoint</b>

       Controls  how  Postgres handles checkpoints at the start of a backup. Set to <b>false</b> (default) to allow the
       checkpoint  to  complete  according  to  <b>checkpoint_completion_target</b>.  Set  to  <b>true</b>  for  an  immediate
       checkpoint, where Postgres completes the checkpoint as quickly as possible.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>keepalive_interval</b>

       Sets  the interval in seconds for sending a heartbeat query to keep the libpq connection active during an
       rsync backup. Default is <b>60</b> seconds. Setting this to <b>0</b> disables the heartbeat.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>lock_directory_cleanup</b>

       Enables automatic cleanup of unused lock files in the <b>barman_lock_directory</b>.

       Scope: Global.

       <b>log_file</b>

       Specifies the location of Barman's log file. Defaults to <b>/var/log/barman/barman.log</b>.

       Scope: Global.

       <b>log_level</b>

       Sets the level of logging. Options include: <b>DEBUG</b>, <b>INFO</b>, <b>WARNING</b>, <b>ERROR</b> and <b>CRITICAL</b>.

       Scope: Global.

       <b>minimum_redundancy</b>

       Specifies the minimum number of backups to retain. Default is <b>0</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>model</b>

       When set to <b>true</b>, turns a server section from a configuration file into a model for a cluster.  There  is
       no <b>false</b> option in this case. If you want to simulate a <b>false</b> option, comment out (<b>#model=true</b>) or remove
       the option in the configuration. Defaults to the server name.

       Scope: Model.

       <b>network_compression</b>

       Enables  or  disables  data  compression  for  network  transfers.  Set  to  <b>false</b>  (default)  to disable
       compression, or <b>true</b> to enable it and reduce network usage.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>parallel_jobs</b>

       Controls the number of parallel workers used to copy files during backup  or  recovery.   It  must  be  a
       positive integer. Default is <b>1</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Applies only when <b>backup_method</b> <b>=</b> <b>rsync</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>parallel_jobs_start_batch_period</b>

       Specifies  the time interval in seconds over which a single batch of parallel jobs will start. Default is
       <b>1</b> second. This means that if <b>parallel_jobs_start_batch_size</b> is <b>10</b> and <b>parallel_jobs_start_batch_period</b> is
       <b>1</b>, this will yield an effective rate limit of <b>10</b> jobs per second, because there is a maximum of  <b>10</b>  jobs
       that can be started within <b>1</b> second.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Applies only when <b>backup_method</b> <b>=</b> <b>rsync</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>parallel_jobs_start_batch_size</b>

       Defines  the  maximum  number of parallel jobs to start in a single batch. Default is <b>10</b> jobs. This means
       that if <b>parallel_jobs_start_batch_size</b> is <b>10</b> and <b>parallel_jobs_start_batch_period</b> is <b>2</b>, this will yield a
       maximum of <b>10</b> jobs that can be started within <b>2</b> seconds.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Applies only when <b>backup_method</b> <b>=</b> <b>rsync</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>path_prefix</b>

       Lists one or more absolute paths, separated by colons, where Barman looks for executable  files  such  as
       PostgreSQL binaries (from the appropriate <b>bin</b> directory for the <b>PG_MAJOR_VERSION</b>), <b>rsync</b>, encryption, and
       compression  tools. These paths are prepended to the <b>PATH</b> environment variable and are checked before any
       others.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>primary_checkpoint_timeout</b>

       Time to wait for new WAL files before forcing a checkpoint on the primary server.  Defaults to <b>0</b>.

       Scope: Server / Model.

       <b>primary_conninfo</b>

       Connection string for Barman to connect to the primary Postgres server during a standby backup.

       Scope: Server / Model.

       <b>primary_ssh_command</b>

       SSH command for connecting to the primary Barman server if Barman is passive.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>slot_name</b>

       Replication slot name for the <b>receive-wal</b> command when <b>streaming_archiver</b> is enabled.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>ssh_command</b>

       SSH command used by Barman to connect to the Postgres server for rsync backups.

       Scope: Server / Model.

       <b>streaming_archiver</b>

       Enables Postgres' streaming protocol for WAL files. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          If neither <b>archiver</b> nor <b>streaming_archiver</b> is  configured,  Barman  will  automatically  set  <b>archiver</b>
          option  to  <b>true</b>  to  maintain  compatibility  with  the previous default behavior where archiving was
          enabled by default.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>streaming_archiver_batch_size</b>

       Batch size for processing WAL files in streaming archiver. Defaults to <b>0</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>streaming_archiver_name</b>

       Application name for the <b>receive-wal</b> command. Defaults to <b>barman_receive_wal</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>streaming_backup_name</b>

       Application name for the <b>pg_basebackup</b> command. Defaults to <b>barman_streaming_backup</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>streaming_conninfo</b>

       Connection string for streaming replication protocol. Defaults to <b>conninfo</b>.

       Scope: Server / Model.

       <b>tablespace_bandwidth_limit</b>

       Maximum transfer rate for specific tablespaces  for  backup  and  recovery  operations.   A  value  of  <b>0</b>
       indicates no limit (default).

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Applies only when <b>backup_method</b> <b>=</b> <b>rsync</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

   <b>Backups</b>
       These configurations options are related to how Barman will execute backups.

       <b>autogenerate_manifest</b>

       This  is  a  boolean option that allows for the automatic creation of backup manifest files. The manifest
       file, which is a JSON document, lists all files included in the backup. It is generated  upon  completion
       of  the  backup  and  saved  in  the  backup  directory.  The  format of the manifest file adheres to the
       specifications outlined in the <u>PostgreSQL</u> <u>documentation</u> and is compatible with the <b>pg_verifybackup</b>  tool.
       Default is <b>false</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This option is ignored if the <b>backup_method</b> is not <b>rsync</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>backup_compression</b>

       Specifies  the  compression  method  for  the  backup process. It can be set to <b>gzip</b>, <b>lz4</b>, <b>zstd</b>, or <b>none</b>.
       Ensure that the CLI tool for the chosen compression method is available on both the Barman  and  Postgres
       servers.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Note  that  <b>lz4</b>  and  <b>zstd</b>  require  Postgres version 15 or later. Unsetting this option or using <b>none</b>
          results in an uncompressed archive (default). Only supported when <b>backup_method</b> <b>=</b> <b>postgres</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>backup_compression_format</b>

       Determines the format <b>pg_basebackup</b> should use when saving compressed backups.  Options are <b>plain</b> or <b>tar</b>,
       with <b>tar</b> as the default if unset. The <b>plain</b> format is available only if Postgres version 15 or  later  is
       in use and <b>backup_compression_location</b> is set to <b>server</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Only supported when <b>backup_method</b> <b>=</b> <b>postgres</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>backup_compression_level</b>

       Defines  the  level  of  compression  for  backups  as  an  integer. The permissible values depend on the
       compression method specified in <b>backup_compression</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Only supported when <b>backup_method</b> <b>=</b> <b>postgres</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>backup_compression_location</b>

       Specifies where compression should occur during the backup: either <b>client</b> or <b>server</b>. The <b>server</b> option is
       available only if Postgres version 15 or later is being used.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Only supported when <b>backup_method</b> <b>=</b> <b>postgres</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>backup_compression_workers</b>

       Sets the number of threads used for compression during the backup process. This is applicable  only  when
       <b>backup_compression=zstd</b>. The default value is 0, which uses the standard compression behavior.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Only supported when <b>backup_method</b> <b>=</b> <b>postgres</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>backup_directory</b>

       Specifies   the   directory   where   backup   data   for   a   server   will   be  stored.  Defaults  to
       <b>&lt;barman_home&gt;/&lt;server_name&gt;</b>.

       Scope: Server.

       <b>backup_method</b>

       Defines the method Barman uses to perform backups. Options include:

       • <b>rsync</b> (default): Executes backups using the rsync command over SSH (requires <b>ssh_command</b>).

       • <b>postgres</b>: Uses the <b>pg_basebackup</b> command for backups.

       • <b>local-rsync</b>: Assumes Barman runs on the same server and as the same  user  as  the  Postgres  database,
         performing an rsync file system copy.

       • <b>snapshot</b>:  Utilizes  the  API of the cloud provider specified in the <b>snapshot_provider</b> option to create
         disk snapshots as defined in <b>snapshot_disks</b> and saves only the backup label and  metadata  to  its  own
         storage.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>backup_options</b>

       Controls  how  Barman  interacts  with  Postgres  during backups. This is a comma-separated list that can
       include:

       • <b>concurrent_backup</b> (default): Uses concurrent backup, recommended for Postgres versions 9.6  and  later,
         and supports backups from standby servers.

       • <b>exclusive_backup</b>:  Uses  the  deprecated exclusive backup method. Only for Postgres versions older than
         15. This option will be removed in the future.

       • <b>external_configuration</b>: Suppresses warnings about external configuration files during backup execution.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          <b>exclusive_backup</b> and <b>concurrent_backup</b> cannot be used together.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>basebackups_directory</b>

       Specifies the directory where base backups are stored. Defaults to <b>&lt;backup_directory&gt;/base</b>.

       Scope: Server.

       <b>basebackup_retry_sleep</b>

       Sets the number of seconds to wait after a failed base  backup  copy  before  retrying.   Default  is  <b>30</b>
       seconds. Must be a non-negative integer.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This applies to both backup and recovery operations.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>basebackup_retry_times</b>

       Defines  the  number  of  retry  attempts for a base backup copy after an error occurs.  Default is <b>0</b> (no
       retries). Must be a non-negative integer.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This applies to both backup and recovery operations.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>reuse_backup</b>

       Controls incremental backup support when using <b>backup_method=rsync</b> by reusing the last available  backup.
       The options are:

       • <b>off</b> (default): Standard full backup.

       • <b>copy</b>: File-level incremental backup, by reusing the last backup for a server and creating a copy of the
         unchanged files (just for backup time reduction)

       • <b>link</b>:  File-level  incremental backup, by reusing the last backup for a server and creating a hard link
         of the unchanged files (for backup space and time reduction)

       These configuration options are related to how Barman will manage the  Write-Ahead  Logs  (WALs)  of  the
       PostreSQL servers.

       <b>compression</b>

       Specifies the standard compression algorithm for WAL files. Options include: <b>lz4</b>, <b>xz</b>, <b>zstd</b>, <b>gzip</b>, <b>pygzip</b>,
       <b>pigz</b>, <b>bzip2</b>, <b>pybzip2</b>, <b>snappy</b> and <b>custom</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          All  of  these  options  require the module to be installed in the location where the compression will
          occur.

          The <b>custom</b> option is for custom compression, which requires you to set the following options as well:

          • <b>custom_compression_filter</b>: a compression filter.

          • <b>custom_decompression_filter</b>: a decompression filter

          • <b>custom_compression_magic</b>: a hex string to identify a custom compressed wal file.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>custom_compression_filter</b>

       Specifies a custom compression algorithm for WAL files. It must be a <b>string</b> that will be used  internally
       to  create  a  bash  command and it will prefix to the following string <b>&gt;</b> <b>"$2"</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>"$1";</b>. Write to standard
       output and do not delete input files.

       <b>TIP:</b>
          <b>custom_compression_filter</b> <b>=</b> <b>"xz</b> <b>-c"</b>

          This is the same as running <b>xz</b> <b>-c</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>"$2"</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>"$1";</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>custom_compression_magic</b>

       Defines a custom magic value to identify the custom compression algorithm used in WAL files. If  this  is
       set,  Barman  will  avoid  applying custom compression to WALs that have already been compressed with the
       specified algorithm. If not configured, Barman will apply custom compression to all WAL files, even those
       pre-compressed.

       <b>TIP:</b>
          For example, in the <b>xz</b> compression algorithm, the magic number is used to detect  the  format  of  <b>.xz</b>
          files.

          <b>For</b> <b>xz</b> <b>files,</b> <b>the</b> <b>magic</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>bytes:</b>
                 Magic Number: <b>FD</b> <b>37</b> <b>7A</b> <b>58</b> <b>5A</b> <b>00</b>

          <b>In</b> <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>representation,</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>as:</b>
                 Hex String: <b>fd377a585a00</b>

          As  Barman expects the value of <b>custom_compression_magic</b> to be prefixed with <b>0x</b>, you would need to set
          that config option like this:

              custom_compression_magic = 0xfd377a585a00

          Reference: <u>xz-file-format</u>

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>custom_decompression_filter</b>

       Specifies a custom decompression algorithm for compressed WAL files. It must be a  <b>string</b>  that  will  be
       used  internally  to  create a bash command and it will prefix to the following string <b>&gt;</b> <b>"$2"</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>"$1";</b>. It
       must correspond with the compression algorithm used.

       <b>TIP:</b>
          <b>custom_compression_filter</b> <b>=</b> <b>"xz</b> <b>-c</b> <b>-d"</b>

          This is the same as running <b>xz</b> <b>-c</b> <b>-d</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>"$2"</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>"$1";</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>compression_level</b>

       Specifies the compression level to be used by  the  selected  compression  algorithm.  Valid  values  are
       integers within the supported range of the chosen algorithm or one of the predefined labels: <b>low</b>, <b>medium</b>,
       and <b>high</b>, which serve as shortcuts.

       • <b>low</b>: uses low level of compression, favoring compression speed over compression ratio.

       • <b>medium</b>: uses a medium level of compression, balancing between compression speed and compression ratio.

       • <b>high</b>: uses a high level of compression, favoring compression ratio over compression speed.

       Predefined labels map to algorithm-specific levels, as detailed below:

       If the specified compression level is greater than the algorithm's maximum level, that maximum  level  is
       used.  Similarly, if it is lower than the minimum level, that minimum level is used. The default value is
       <b>medium</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>incoming_wals_directory</b>

       Specifies the directory where incoming WAL files are archived. Requires <b>archiver</b> to be enabled.  Defaults
       to <b>&lt;backup_directory&gt;/incoming</b>.

       Scope: Server.

       <b>last_wal_maximum_age</b>

       Defines  the  time  frame  within which the latest archived WAL file must fall. If the latest WAL file is
       older than this period, the barman check command will report an error. If left empty (default),  the  age
       of the WAL files is not checked. Format is the same as <b>last_backup_maximum_age</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>max_incoming_wals_queue</b>

       Defines  the  maximum  number  of  WAL  files allowed in the incoming queue (including both streaming and
       archiving pools) before the barman check command returns an error.  Default is <b>None</b> (disabled).

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>streaming_wals_directory</b>

       Directory for streaming WAL files. Defaults to <b>&lt;backup_directory&gt;/streaming</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This option is applicable when <b>streaming_archiver</b> is activated.

       Scope: Server.

       <b>wal_conninfo</b>

       The <b>wal_conninfo</b> connection string is used by Barman for monitoring the status of  the  replication  slot
       receiving  WALs.  If  specified,  it  takes  precedence  over <b>wal_streaming_conninfo</b> for these checks. If
       <b>wal_conninfo</b>  is  not   set   but   <b>wal_streaming_conninfo</b>   is,   <b>wal_conninfo</b>   will   fall   back   to
       <b>wal_streaming_conninfo</b>. If neither <b>wal_conninfo</b> nor <b>wal_streaming_conninfo</b> is set, <b>wal_conninfo</b> will fall
       back  to  <b>conninfo</b>.  Both  connection  strings must access a Postgres instance within the same cluster as
       defined by <b>streaming_conninfo</b> and <b>conninfo</b>. If both <b>wal_conninfo</b> and <b>wal_streaming_conninfo</b> are set, only
       <b>wal_conninfo</b> needs the appropriate permissions to read settings and check the  replication  slot  status.
       However,  if  only <b>wal_streaming_conninfo</b> is set, it must have the necessary permissions to perform these
       tasks. The  required  permissions  include  roles  such  as  <b>pg_monitor</b>,  both  <b>pg_read_all_settings</b>  and
       <b>pg_read_all_stats</b>, or superuser privileges.

       Scope: Server / Model.

       <b>wal_streaming_conninfo</b>

       This connection string is used by Barman to connect to the Postgres server for receiving WAL segments via
       streaming  replication  and  checking  the  replication  slot  status, if <b>wal_conninfo</b> is not set. If not
       specified, Barman defaults to using  <b>streaming_conninfo</b>  for  these  tasks.  <b>wal_streaming_conninfo</b>  must
       connect  to  a  Postgres  instance  within the same cluster as defined by <b>streaming_conninfo</b>, and it must
       support streaming replication. If both <b>wal_streaming_conninfo</b> and <b>wal_conninfo</b> are set, only <b>wal_conninfo</b>
       needs the required permissions  to  read  settings  and  check  the  replication  slot  status.  If  only
       <b>wal_streaming_conninfo</b>  is  specified,  it must have these permissions. The necessary permissions include
       roles such as <b>pg_monitor</b>, both <b>pg_read_all_settings</b> and <b>pg_read_all_stats</b>, or superuser privileges.

       <b>xlogdb_directory</b>

       A custom directory for the <b>SERVER-xlog.db</b> file, <b>SERVER</b> being the server name.  This file stores  metadata
       of  archived  WAL  files  and  is  used  internally  by  Barman.  If  unset,  it defaults to the value of
       <b>wals_directory</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server.

   <b>Restore</b>
       These configuration options are related to how Barman manages restoration backups.

       <b>local_staging_path</b>

       Specifies the local path for combining block-level incremental backups during  recovery.   This  location
       must  have  sufficient space to temporarily store the new synthetic backup.  Required for recovery from a
       block-level incremental backup.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Applies only when <b>backup_method</b> <b>=</b> <b>postgres</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>recovery_options</b>

       Options for recovery operations. Currently, only <b>get-wal</b> is supported. This option enables  the  creation
       of  a  basic  <b>restore_command</b>  in  the  recovery  configuration, which uses the barman <b>get-wal</b> command to
       retrieve WAL files directly from Barman's WAL archive. This setting accepts  a  comma-separated  list  of
       values and defaults to empty.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>recovery_staging_path</b>

       Specifies  the  path  on  the recovery host for staging files from compressed backups. This location must
       have sufficient space to temporarily store the compressed backup.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Applies only for commpressed backups.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

   <b>Retention</b> <b>Policies</b>
       These configuration options are related to how Barman manages retention policies of the backups.

       <b>last_backup_maximum_age</b>

       Defines the time frame within which the latest backup must fall. If the latest backup is older than  this
       period,  the  barman  check  command  will report an error. If left empty (default), the latest backup is
       always considered valid. The accepted format is <b>"n</b> <b>{DAYS|WEEKS|MONTHS|HOURS}"</b>,  where  <b>n</b>  is  an  integer
       greater than zero.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>last_backup_minimum_size</b>

       Specifies  the  minimum acceptable size for the latest successful backup. If the latest backup is smaller
       than this size, the barman check command will report an error. If left empty (default), the latest backup
       is always considered valid. The accepted format is <b>"n</b> <b>{k|Ki|M|Mi|G|Gi|T|Ti}"</b> and case-sensitive, where  <b>n</b>
       is  an  integer  greater  than  zero, with an optional SI or IEC suffix. k stands for kilo with k = 1000,
       while Ki stands for kilobytes Ki = 1024. The rest of the options have  the  same  reasoning  for  greater
       units of measure.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>retention_policy</b>

       Defines  how  long  backups  and WAL files should be retained. If this option is left blank, no retention
       policies will be applied. Options include redundancy and recovery window policies.

          retention_policy = {REDUNDANCY value | RECOVERY WINDOW OF value {DAYS | WEEKS | MONTHS}}

       • <b>retention_policy</b> <b>=</b> <b>REDUNDANCY</b> <b>2</b> will keep only 2 backups in the backup catalog  automatically  deleting
         the older one as new backups are created. The number must be a positive integer.

       • <b>retention_policy</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>RECOVERY</b> <b>WINDOW</b> <b>OF</b> <b>2</b> <b>DAYS</b> will only keep backups needed to recover to any point in
         time in the last two days, automatically deleting backups that are older. The period number must  be  a
         positive integer, and   the following options can be applied to it: <b>DAYS</b>, <b>WEEKS</b>, <b>MONTHS</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>retention_policy_mode</b>

       Mode for enforcing retention policies. Currently only supports <b>auto</b>.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

       <b>wal_retention_policy</b>

       Policy for retaining WAL files. Currently only <b>main</b> is available.

       Scope: Global / Server / Model.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>MODELS</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration  models  provide  a  systematic  approach  to  manage and apply configuration overrides for
       Postgres servers by organizing them under a specific <b>cluster</b> name.

   <b>Purpose</b>
       The primary goal of a configuration model is to simplify the management  of  configuration  settings  for
       Postgres  servers  grouped  by  the  same  <b>cluster</b>.  By  using  a  model,  you  can apply a set of common
       configuration overrides, enhancing operational efficiency. They are especially  beneficial  in  clustered
       environments,  allowing  you  to create various configuration models that can be utilized during failover
       events.

   <b>Application</b>
       The configurations defined in a model file can be applied to Postgres servers that share the same <b>cluster</b>
       name specified in the model. Consequently, any server utilizing that model can  inherit  these  settings,
       promoting a consistent and adaptable configuration across all servers.

   <b>Usage</b>
       Model options can only be defined within a model section, which is identified in the same way as a server
       section. It is important to ensure that there are no conflicts between the identifiers of server sections
       and model sections.

       To  apply  a  configuration  model, execute the <b>barman</b> <b>config-switch</b> <b>SERVER_NAME</b> <b>MODEL_NAME</b>. This command
       facilitates the application of the model's overrides to the relevant Barman server  associated  with  the
       specified cluster name.

       If you wish to remove the overrides, the deletion of the model configuration file alone will not have any
       effect, so you can do so by using the <b>--reset</b> argument with the command, as follows: <b>barman</b> <b>config-switch</b>
       <b>SERVER_NAME</b> <b>--reset</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The  <b>config-switch</b>  command  will  only  succeed  if model name exists and is associated with the same
          <b>cluster</b> as the server. Additionally, there can be only one active model at a time; if you execute  the
          command  multiple  times  with  different models, only the overrides defined in the last model will be
          applied.

          Not all options  can  be  configured  through  models.  Please  review  the  scope  of  the  available
          configurations to determine which settings apply to models.

   <b>Benefits</b>
       • Consistency: Ensures uniform configuration across multiple Barman servers within a cluster.

       • Efficiency: Simplifies configuration management by allowing centralized updates and overrides.

       • Flexibility:  Allows  the  use of multiple model files, providing the ability to define various sets of
         overrides as necessary.
