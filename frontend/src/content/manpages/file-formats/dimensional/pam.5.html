</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pam - Netpbm common 2-dimensional bitmap format

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b></h4><pre>
       The PAM image format is a lowest common denominator 2 dimensional map format.

       It is designed to be used for any of myriad kinds of graphics, but can theoretically be used for any kind
       of  data  that is arranged as a two dimensional rectangular array.  Actually, from another perspective it
       can be seen as a format for data arranged as a three dimensional array.

       The name "PAM" is an acronym derived from "Portable Arbitrary Map." This derivation makes more  sense  if
       you consider it in the context of the other Netpbm format names: PBM, PGM, and PPM.

       This  format  does  not define the meaning of the data at any particular point in the array.  It could be
       red, green, and blue light intensities such that the array represents a visual image, or it could be  the
       same  red, green, and blue components plus a transparency component, or it could contain annual rainfalls
       for places on the surface of the Earth.  Any process that uses the PAM format  must  further  define  the
       format to specify the meanings of the data.

       A  PAM  image  describes  a two dimensional grid of tuples.  The tuples are arranged in rows and columns.
       The width of the image is the number of columns.  The height of the image is the  number  of  rows.   All
       rows  are  the  same  width and all columns are the same height.  The tuples may have any degree, but all
       tuples have the same degree.  The degree of the tuples is called the depth of the image.  Each member  of
       a tuple is called a sample.  A sample is an unsigned integer which represents a locus along a scale which
       starts  at  zero and ends at a certain maximum value called the maxval.  The maxval is the same for every
       sample in the image.  The two dimensional array of all the Nth samples of each tuple is  called  the  Nth
       plane or Nth channel of the image.

       Though  the  basic  format  does  not assign any meaning to the tuple values, it does include an optional
       string that describes that meaning.  The contents of this string, called the tuple  type,  are  arbitrary
       from  the  point  of  view  of  the basic PAM format, but users of the format may assign meaning to it by
       convention so they can identify their particular implementations of the PAM format.  Some tuple types are
       defined as official subformats of PAM.  See Defined Tuple Types .

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>Confusing</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>of</b> <b>Netpbm</b> <b>Formats</b></h4><pre>
       It is easy to get confused about the relationship between the PAM format and  PBM,  PGM,  PPM,  and  PNM.
       Here is a little enlightenment:

       "PNM"  is  not really a format.  It is a shorthand for the PBM, PGM, and PPM formats collectively.  It is
       also the name of a group of library functions that can each handle all three of those formats.

       "PAM" is in fact a fourth format.  But it is so general that you can represent the same information in  a
       PAM  image  as  you can in a PBM, PGM, or PPM image.  And in fact a program that is designed to read PBM,
       PGM, or PPM and does so with a recent version of the Netpbm library will read  an  equivalent  PAM  image
       just fine and the program will never know the difference.

       To  confuse  things  more, there is a collection of library routines called the "pam" functions that read
       and write the PAM format, but also read and write the PBM, PGM, and PPM formats.  They  do  this  because
       the  latter  formats  are much older and more popular, so even a new program must work with them.  Having
       the library handle all the formats makes it convenient to write programs that use the newer PAM format as
       well.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>LAYOUT</b></h4><pre>
       A convenient way to read and write the PAM  format  accurately  is  via  the  <b><a href="../man1/libnetpbm.1.html">libnetpbm</a></b>(1)  C  subroutine
       library.

       A  PAM  file consists of a sequence of one or more PAM images.  There are no data, delimiters, or padding
       before, after, or between images.

       Each PAM image consists of a header followed immediately by a raster.

       Here is an example header:

       P7
       WIDTH 227
       HEIGHT 149
       DEPTH 3
       MAXVAL 255
       TUPLTYPE RGB
       ENDHDR

       The header begins with the ASCII characters "P7" followed by newline.  This is the magic number.

       Note: <b>xv</b> thumbnail images also start with  the  "P7"  magic  number.   (This  and  PAM  were  independent
       extensions  to  the  Netpbm  formats).  The rest of the format makes it easy to distinguish PAM from that
       format, though).

       The header continues with an arbitrary number of lines of  ASCII  text.   Each  line  ends  with  and  is
       delimited by a newline character.

       Each  header  line consists of zero or more whitespace-delimited tokens or begins with "#".  If it begins
       with "#" it is a comment and the rest of this specification does not apply to it.

       A header line which has zero tokens is valid but has no meaning.

       The type of header line is identified by its first token, which is 8 characters or less:

       <b>ENDHDR</b> This is the last line in the header.  The header must contain exactly one of these header lines.

       <b>HEIGHT</b> The second token is a decimal number representing the height of the image (number of  rows).   The
              header must contain exactly one of these header lines.

       <b>WIDTH</b>  The second token is a decimal number representing the width of the image (number of columns).  The
              header must contain exactly one of these header lines.

       <b>DEPTH</b>  The  second  token  is  a  decimal number representing the depth of the image (number of planes or
              channels).  The header must contain exactly one of these header lines.

       <b>MAXVAL</b> The second token is a decimal number representing the  maxval  of  the  image.   The  header  must
              contain exactly one of these header lines.

       <b>TUPLTYPE</b>
              The  header may contain any number of these header lines, including zero.  The rest of the line is
              part of the tuple type.  The rest of the line is not  tokenized,  but  the  tuple  type  does  not
              include  any  white space immediately following <b>TUPLTYPE</b>  or at the very end of the line.  It does
              not include a newline.  There must be something other than white space after the <b>TUPLTYPE</b> token.

              If there are multiple <b>TUPLTYPE</b> header lines, the tuple type is the  concatenation  of  the  values
              from  each  of them, separated by a single blank, in the order in which they appear in the header.
              If there are no <b>TUPLTYPE</b> header lines the tuple type is the null string.

       The raster consists of each row of the image, in order from top to bottom, consecutive with no  delimiter
       of any kind between, before, or after, rows.

       Each  row  consists of every tuple in the row, in order from left to right, consecutive with no delimiter
       of any kind between, before, or after, tuples.

       Each tuple consists of every sample in the tuple, in order, consecutive with no  delimiter  of  any  kind
       between, before, or after, samples.

       Each  sample consists of an unsigned integer in pure binary format, with the most significant byte first.
       The number of bytes is the minimum number of bytes required to represent the maxval of the image.

       The character referred to as "newline" herein is the character known in ASCII as Line Feed or LF.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Height, width, depth, and maxval are at least 1.

       Height, width, and depth have no defined maximum, but processors and generators of  images  usually  have
       their own limitations.

       The  maxval  of  an image is never greater than 65535.  (The reason it is limited is to make it easier to
       build an image processor, in which intermediate arithmetic values often have  to  fit  within  31  or  32
       bits).   There was no specified limitation before October, 2005, but essentially all implementations have
       always observed it.

</pre><h4><b>DEFINED</b> <b>TUPLE</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       Some tuple types are defined in this specification to specify official subformats of PAM  for  especially
       popular  applications of the format.  Users of the format may also define their own tuple types, and thus
       their own subformats.

       Tuple type affects <u>only</u> the meanings of the samples (which are unsigned integers) in the  tuples  of  the
       image.  It does not affect how the samples or tuples are encoded.  Tuple type may affect the meaning of a
       tuple's position in the array (e.g. it may indicate in a visual image that a tuple in Row 1 is one at the
       top of the image rather than the bottom).

       Tuple  type  never  determines  how  many samples are in a tuple (that is instead determined by the DEPTH
       header line).  Tuple type could be said to imply a depth (number of samples per  tuple)  because  certain
       tuple  types are valid only in combination with certain DEPTH values, but it is good programming practice
       to use DEPTH for the depth when decoding the raster and separately validate that the depth is  consistent
       with  the  tuple type.  Also, it is good practice to accept a depth that is too great and just ignore the
       higher numbered planes.

   <b>PAM</b> <b>Used</b> <b>For</b> <b>Visual</b> <b>Images</b>
       A common use of PAM images is to represent visual images such as are typically represented by  images  in
       the older and more concrete PBM, PGM, and PPM formats.

       <b>Black</b> <b>And</b> <b>White</b>

       A  black  and white image, such as would alternatively be represented by a PBM image, has a tuple type of
       "BLACKANDWHITE".  Such a PAM image has a depth of 1 and maxval 1 where the one sample in each tuple is  0
       to  represent  a  black  pixel  and  1 to represent a white one.  The maxval, height, width, and order of
       tuples in the raster bear the obvious relationship to those of the equivalent PGM image.

       Note that in the PBM format, a sample value of zero means white, but in PAM, zero means black.

       <b>Grayscale</b>

       A grayscale image, such as would alternatively be represented by  a  PGM  image,  has  a  tuple  type  of
       "GRAYSCALE".   Such a PAM image has a depth of 1.  The maxval, height, width, and raster bear the obvious
       relationship to those of the equivalent PGM image.

       <b>Color</b>

       A color image, such as would alternatively be represented by a PPM image, has  a  tuple  type  of  "RGB".
       Such  a  PAM image has a depth of 3.  The maxval, height, width, and raster bear the obvious relationship
       to those of the PPM image.  The first plane represents red, the second green, and the third blue.

       <b>Transparent</b>

       Each of the visual image formats mentioned above has a variation that contains transparency  information.
       In  that  variation,  the tuple type has "_ALPHA" added to it (e.g. "RGB_ALPHA") and one more plane.  The
       highest numbered plane is the opacity plane (sometimes called an alpha plane or transparency plane).

       In this kind of image, the color represented by a pixel  is  actually  a  combination  of  an  explicitly
       specified foreground color and a background color to be identified later.

       The  planes  other  than  the opacity plane describe the foreground color.  A sample in the opacity plane
       tells how opaque the pixel is, by telling what fraction of the pixel's light comes  from  the  foreground
       color.  The rest of the pixel's light comes from the (unspecified) background color.

       For  example,  in  a GRAYSCALE_ALPHA image, assume Plane 0 indicates a gray tone 60% of white and Plane 1
       indicates opacity 25%.  The foreground color is the 60% gray, and 25% of that contributes to the ultimate
       color of the pixel.  The other 75% comes from some background color.  So let's assume  further  that  the
       background  color  of  the pixel is full white.  Then the color of the pixel is 90% of white:  25% of the
       foreground 60%, plus 75% of the background 100%.

       The sample value is the opacity fraction just described, as a fraction of the maxval.  Note  that  it  is
       <u>not</u> gamma-adjusted like the foreground color samples.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNET</b> <b>MEDIA</b> <b>TYPE</b></h4><pre>
       No  Internet  Media  Type  (aka  MIME  type, content type) for PBM has been registered with IANA, but the
       unofficial value image/x-portable-arbitrarymap is assigned by this specification, to be  consistent  with
       conventional values for the older Netpbm formats.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       The conventional suffix for the name of a PAM file is ".pam".  But this is not required.
