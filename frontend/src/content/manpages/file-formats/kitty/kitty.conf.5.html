</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       kitty.conf - Configuration file for kitty

</pre><h4><b>Overview</b></h4><pre>
       <u>kitty</u>  is  highly  customizable,  everything from keyboard shortcuts, to rendering frames-per-second. See
       below for an overview of all customization possibilities.

       You can open the config file within <u>kitty</u> by pressing <u>ctrl+shift+f2</u> (<b>⌘</b>+<b>,</b> on  macOS).  A  <b>kitty.conf</b>  with
       commented  default  configurations  and descriptions will be created if the file does not exist.  You can
       reload the config file within <u>kitty</u> by pressing <u>ctrl+shift+f5</u> (<b>⌃</b>+<b>⌘</b>+<b>,</b>  on  macOS)  or  sending  <u>kitty</u>  the
       <b>SIGUSR1</b>  signal with <b>kill</b> <b>-SIGUSR1</b> <b>$KITTY_PID</b>. You can also display the current configuration by pressing
       <u>ctrl+shift+f6</u> (<b>⌥</b>+<b>⌘</b>+<b>,</b> on macOS).

       <u>kitty</u> looks for a config file in the OS config directories (usually <b><a href="file:~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf">~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf</a></b>)  but  you
       can  pass  a  specific  path  via the <u>kitty</u> <u>--config</u> option or use the <u>KITTY_CONFIG_DIRECTORY</u> environment
       variable. See <u>kitty</u> <u>--config</u> for full details.

       <b>Comments</b> can be added to the config file as lines starting with the <b>#</b> character. This works only if the <b>#</b>
       character is the first character in the line.

       <b>Lines</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>split</b> by starting the next line with the <b>\</b> character.  All  leading  whitespace  and  the  <b>\</b>
       character are removed.

       You can <b>include</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>config</b> <b>files</b> via the <b>include</b> directive. If you use a relative path for <b>include</b>,
       it  is  resolved with respect to the location of the current config file. Note that environment variables
       are expanded, so <b>${USER}.conf</b> becomes <b>name.conf</b> if <b>USER=name</b>. A special environment variable <u>KITTY_OS</u>  is
       available,  to  detect the operating system. It is <b>linux</b>, <b>macos</b> or <b>bsd</b>.  Also, you can use <b>globinclude</b> to
       include files matching a shell glob pattern and <b>envinclude</b>  to  include  configuration  from  environment
       variables. Finally, you can dynamically generate configuration by running a program using <b>geninclude</b>. For
       example:

          # Include other.conf
          include other.conf
          # Include *.conf files from all subdirs of kitty.d inside the kitty config dir
          globinclude kitty.d/**/*.conf
          # Include the *contents* of all env vars starting with KITTY_CONF_
          envinclude KITTY_CONF_*
          # Run the script dynamic.py placed in the same directory as this config file
          # and include its :file:`STDOUT`. Note that Python scripts are fastest
          # as they use the embedded Python interpreter, but any executable script
          # or program is supported, in any language. Remember to mark the script
          # file executable.
          geninclude dynamic.py

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Syntax highlighting for <b>kitty.conf</b> in vim is available via <u>vim-kitty</u>.

</pre><h4><b>Fonts</b></h4><pre>
       kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure individual font faces and even specify special
       fonts for particular characters.

       <b>font_family,</b> <b>bold_font,</b> <b>italic_font,</b> <b>bold_italic_font</b>

          font_family      monospace
          bold_font        auto
          italic_font      auto
          bold_italic_font auto

       You  can  specify  different  fonts  for the bold/italic/bold-italic variants.  The easiest way to select
       fonts is to run the <b>kitten</b> <b>choose-fonts</b> command which will present a nice UI for you to select the  fonts
       you  want  with previews and support for selecting variable fonts and font features. If you want to learn
       to select fonts manually, read the <u>font</u> <u>specification</u> <u>syntax</u>.

       <b>font_size</b>

          font_size 11.0

       Font size (in pts).

       <b>force_ltr</b>

          force_ltr no

       kitty does not support BIDI (bidirectional text), however,  for  RTL  scripts,  words  are  automatically
       displayed  in  RTL.  That is to say, in an RTL script, the words "HELLO WORLD" display in kitty as "WORLD
       HELLO", and if you try to select a substring of an RTL-shaped string, you will  get  the  character  that
       would  be  there  had  the  string been LTR. For example, assuming the Hebrew word ירושלים, selecting the
       character that on the screen appears to be ם actually writes into the selection buffer the  character  י.
       kitty's  default  behavior  is useful in conjunction with a filter to reverse the word order, however, if
       you wish to manipulate RTL glyphs, it can be very challenging to work with, so this option is provided to
       turn it off. Furthermore, this option can be used with the command line program <u>GNU</u> <u>FriBidi</u> to  get  BIDI
       support,  because  it  will  force  kitty  to  always  treat  the  text as LTR, which FriBidi expects for
       terminals.

       <b>symbol_map</b>

       Has no default values. Example values are shown below:

          symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A3,U+E0C0-U+E0C7 PowerlineSymbols

       Map the specified Unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful if you need special rendering for  some
       symbols,  such  as for Powerline. Avoids the need for patched fonts. Each Unicode code point is specified
       in the form <b>U+&lt;code</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>hexadecimal&gt;</b>. You can specify multiple code points, separated by commas  and
       ranges separated by hyphens. This option can be specified multiple times. The syntax is:

          symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name

       <b>narrow_symbols</b>

       Has no default values. Example values are shown below:

          narrow_symbols U+E0A0-U+E0A3,U+E0C0-U+E0C7 1

       Usually,  for  Private  Use  Unicode  characters  and some symbol/dingbat characters, if the character is
       followed by one or more spaces, kitty will use those extra cells to render the character larger,  if  the
       character  in  the  font  has  a wide aspect ratio. Using this option you can force kitty to restrict the
       specified code points to render in the specified number of cells (defaulting to one cell).   This  option
       can be specified multiple times. The syntax is:

          narrow_symbols codepoints [optionally the number of cells]

       <b>disable_ligatures</b>

          disable_ligatures never

       Choose  how  you  want to handle multi-character ligatures. The default is to always render them. You can
       tell kitty to not render them when the cursor is over them by using <b>cursor</b> to  make  editing  easier,  or
       have kitty never render them at all by using <b>always</b>, if you don't like them. The ligature strategy can be
       set  per-window  either  using  the  kitty  remote  control  facility  or by defining shortcuts for it in
       <b>kitty.conf</b>, for example:

          map alt+1 disable_ligatures_in active always
          map alt+2 disable_ligatures_in all never
          map alt+3 disable_ligatures_in tab cursor

       Note that this refers to programming ligatures, typically implemented using the  <b>calt</b>  OpenType  feature.
       For disabling general ligatures, use the <u>font_features</u> option.

       <b>font_features</b>

       Has no default values. Example values are shown below:

          font_features none

       Choose  exactly  which OpenType features to enable or disable. Note that for the main fonts, features can
       be specified when selecting the font using the choose-fonts kitten.  This setting is useful for  fallback
       fonts.

       Some  fonts might have features worthwhile in a terminal. For example, Fira Code includes a discretionary
       feature, <b>zero</b>, which in that font changes the appearance  of  the  zero  (0),  to  make  it  more  easily
       distinguishable  from  Ø.  Fira  Code  also includes other discretionary features known as Stylistic Sets
       which have the tags <b>ss01</b> through <b>ss20</b>.

       For the exact syntax to use for individual features, see the <u>HarfBuzz</u> <u>documentation</u>.

       Note that this code is indexed by PostScript name, and not the font family. This  allows  you  to  define
       very  precise  feature settings; e.g. you can disable a feature in the italic font but not in the regular
       font.

       On Linux, font features are first read from the FontConfig database and then this option is  applied,  so
       they can be configured in a single, central place.

       To get the PostScript name for a font, use the <b>fc-scan</b> <b>file.ttf</b> command on Linux or the <u>Font</u> <u>Book</u> <u>tool</u> <u>on</u>
       <u>macOS</u>.

       Enable alternate zero and oldstyle numerals:

          font_features FiraCode-Retina +zero +onum

       Enable only alternate zero in the bold font:

          font_features FiraCode-Bold +zero

       Disable the normal ligatures, but keep the <b>calt</b> feature which (in this font) breaks up monotony:

          font_features TT2020StyleB-Regular -liga +calt

       In  conjunction  with  <u>force_ltr</u>, you may want to disable Arabic shaping entirely, and only look at their
       isolated forms if they show up in a document.  You can do this with e.g.:

          font_features UnifontMedium +isol -medi -fina -init

       <b>modify_font</b>

       Modify font characteristics such as the position or thickness of the  underline  and  strikethrough.  The
       modifications  can  have  the suffix <b>px</b> for pixels or <b>%</b> for percentage of original value. No suffix means
       use pts.  For example:

          modify_font underline_position -2
          modify_font underline_thickness 150%
          modify_font strikethrough_position 2px

       Additionally, you can modify the size of the cell in which each font glyph is rendered and  the  baseline
       at which the glyph is placed in the cell.  For example:

          modify_font cell_width 80%
          modify_font cell_height -2px
          modify_font baseline 3

       Note  that  modifying the baseline will automatically adjust the underline and strikethrough positions by
       the same amount. Increasing the baseline raises glyphs inside the cell and  decreasing  it  lowers  them.
       Decreasing the cell size might cause rendering artifacts, so use with care.

       <b>box_drawing_scale</b>

          box_drawing_scale 0.001, 1, 1.5, 2

       The sizes of the lines used for the box drawing Unicode characters. These values are in pts. They will be
       scaled  by  the monitor DPI to arrive at a pixel value.  There must be four values corresponding to thin,
       normal, thick, and very thick lines.

       <b>undercurl_style</b>

          undercurl_style thin-sparse

       The style with which undercurls are rendered. This option  takes  the  form  <b>(thin|thick)-(sparse|dense)</b>.
       Thin  and  thick  control  the  thickness  of  the undercurl. Sparse and dense control how often the curl
       oscillates. With sparse the curl will peak once per character, with dense  twice.  Changing  this  option
       dynamically via reloading the config or remote control is undefined.

       <b>underline_exclusion</b>

          underline_exclusion 1

       By default kitty renders gaps in underlines when they overlap with descenders (the parts of letters below
       the baseline, such as for y, q, p etc.). This option controls the thickness of the gaps. It can be either
       a  unitless  number in which case it is a fraction of the underline thickness as specified in the font or
       it can have a suffix of <b>px</b> for pixels or <b>pt</b> for points. Set to zero to disable the  gaps.  Changing  this
       option dynamically via reloading the config or remote control is undefined.

       <b>text_composition_strategy</b>

          text_composition_strategy platform

       Control  how  kitty composites text glyphs onto the background color. The default value of <b>platform</b> tries
       for text rendering as close to "native" for the platform kitty is running on as possible.

       A value of <b>legacy</b> uses the old (pre kitty 0.28) strategy for how glyphs are composited.  This  will  make
       dark  text  on  light  backgrounds look thicker and light text on dark backgrounds thinner. It might also
       make some text appear like the strokes are uneven.

       You can fine tune the actual  contrast  curve  used  for  glyph  composition  by  specifying  up  to  two
       space-separated numbers for this setting.

       The first number is the gamma adjustment, which controls the thickness of dark text on light backgrounds.
       Increasing  the  value will make text appear thicker.  The default value for this is <b>1.0</b> on Linux and <b>1.7</b>
       on macOS.  Valid values are <b>0.01</b> and above. The result  is  scaled  based  on  the  luminance  difference
       between the background and the foreground. Dark text on light backgrounds receives the full impact of the
       curve while light text on dark backgrounds is affected very little.

       The  second  number is an additional multiplicative contrast. It is percentage ranging from <b>0</b> to <b>100</b>. The
       default value is <b>0</b> on Linux and <b>30</b> on macOS.

       If you wish to achieve similar looking thickness in light and dark themes, a good way  to  experiment  is
       start  by  setting  the  value  to <b>1.0</b> <b>0</b> and use a dark theme.  Then adjust the second parameter until it
       looks good. Then switch to a light theme and adjust the first parameter  until  the  perceived  thickness
       matches the dark theme.

       <b>text_fg_override_threshold</b>

          text_fg_override_threshold 0

       A  setting  to  prevent  low contrast between foreground and background colors.  Useful when working with
       applications that use colors that do not contrast well with your  preferred  color  scheme.  The  default
       value is <b>0</b>, which means no color overriding is performed.  There are two modes of operation:

       A  value  with the suffix <b>ratio</b> represents the minimum accepted contrast ratio between the foreground and
       background color.  Possible values range from <b>0.0</b> <b>ratio</b> to <b>21.0</b> <b>ratio</b>.  For example, to meet  <u>WCAG</u>  <u>level</u>
       <u>AA</u>  a  value  of <b>4.5</b> <b>ratio</b> can be provided.  The algorithm is implemented using <u>HSLuv</u> which enables it to
       change the perceived lightness of a color just as much as needed without  really  changing  its  hue  and
       saturation.

       A  value with the suffix <b>%</b> represents the minimum accepted difference in luminance between the foreground
       and background color, below which kitty will override the foreground color.   It  is  percentage  ranging
       from  <b>0</b>  <b>%</b>  to  <b>100</b>  <b>%</b>.  If  the  difference  in luminance of the foreground and background is below this
       threshold, the foreground color will be set to white if the background is dark or black if the background
       is light.

       WARNING: Some programs use characters (such as block characters) for graphics display and may  expect  to
       be able to set the foreground and background to the same color (or similar colors). If you see unexpected
       stripes,  dots,  lines,  incorrect color, no color where you expect color, or any kind of graphic display
       problem try setting <u>text_fg_override_threshold</u> to <b>0</b> to see if  this  is  the  cause  of  the  problem  or
       consider using the <b>ratio</b> mode of operation described above instead of the <b>%</b> mode of operation.

</pre><h4><b>Text</b> <b>cursor</b> <b>customization</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cursor</b>

          cursor #cccccc

       Default  text  cursor color. If set to the special value <b>none</b> the cursor will be rendered with a "reverse
       video" effect. Its color will be the color of the text in the cell it  is  over  and  the  text  will  be
       rendered  with  the background color of the cell. Note that if the program running in the terminal sets a
       cursor color, this takes precedence. Also, the cursor colors are modified  if  the  cell  background  and
       foreground  colors  have  very  low  contrast.  Note  that  some themes set this value, so if you want to
       override it, place your value after the lines where the theme file is included.

       <b>cursor_text_color</b>

          cursor_text_color #111111

       The color of text under the cursor. If you want it  rendered  with  the  background  color  of  the  cell
       underneath  instead,  use  the  special keyword: <u>background</u>. Note that if <u>cursor</u> is set to <b>none</b> then this
       option is ignored. Note that some themes set this value, so if you want to override it, place your  value
       after the lines where the theme file is included.

       <b>cursor_shape</b>

          cursor_shape block

       The  cursor shape can be one of <b>block</b>, <b>beam</b>, <b>underline</b>.  Note that when reloading the config this will be
       changed only if the cursor shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal. This  sets  the
       default  cursor  shape,  applications  running  in  the  terminal  can  override it. In particular, <u>shell</u>
       <u>integration</u> in kitty sets the cursor shape to <b>beam</b> at shell  prompts.  You  can  avoid  this  by  setting
       <u>shell_integration</u> to <b>no-cursor</b>.

       <b>cursor_shape_unfocused</b>

          cursor_shape_unfocused hollow

       Defines the text cursor shape when the OS window is not focused. The unfocused cursor shape can be one of
       <b>block</b>, <b>beam</b>, <b>underline</b>, <b>hollow</b> and <b>unchanged</b> (leave the cursor shape as it is).

       <b>cursor_beam_thickness</b>

          cursor_beam_thickness 1.5

       The thickness of the beam cursor (in pts).

       <b>cursor_underline_thickness</b>

          cursor_underline_thickness 2.0

       The thickness of the underline cursor (in pts).

       <b>cursor_blink_interval</b>

          cursor_blink_interval -1

       The interval to blink the cursor (in seconds). Set to zero to disable blinking.  Negative values mean use
       system default. Note that the minimum interval will be limited to <u>repaint_delay</u>. You can also animate the
       cursor  blink  by  specifying  an <u>easing</u> <u>function</u>. For example, setting this to option to <b>0.5</b> <b>ease-in-out</b>
       will cause the cursor blink to be animated over a second, in the first half of the second it will go from
       opaque to transparent and then back again over the next half. You can specify different easing  functions
       for  the  two halves, for example: <b>-1</b> <b>linear</b> <b>ease-out</b>. kitty supports all the <u>CSS</u> <u>easing</u> <u>functions</u>.  Note
       that turning on animations uses extra power as it means the screen is redrawn multiple  times  per  blink
       interval. See also, <u>cursor_stop_blinking_after</u>.

       <b>cursor_stop_blinking_after</b>

          cursor_stop_blinking_after 15.0

       Stop  blinking  cursor after the specified number of seconds of keyboard inactivity. Set to zero to never
       stop blinking.

       <b>cursor_trail</b>

          cursor_trail 0

       Set this to a value larger than zero to enable a "cursor trail" animation.  This  is  an  animation  that
       shows a "trail" following the movement of the text cursor.  It makes it easy to follow large cursor jumps
       and  makes  for  a  cool  visual effect of the cursor zooming around the screen. The actual value of this
       option controls when the animation is triggered. It is a number of milliseconds. The trail animation only
       follows cursors that have stayed in their position for longer than the specified number of  milliseconds.
       This  prevents trails from appearing for cursors that rapidly change their positions during UI updates in
       complex   applications.    See    <u>cursor_trail_decay</u>    to    control    the    animation    speed    and
       <u>cursor_trail_start_threshold</u> to control when a cursor trail is started.

       <b>cursor_trail_decay</b>

          cursor_trail_decay 0.1 0.4

       Controls  the  decay  times  for  the  cursor  trail effect when the <u>cursor_trail</u> is enabled. This option
       accepts two positive float values specifying the fastest and slowest decay times in  seconds.  The  first
       value  corresponds  to  the fastest decay time (minimum), and the second value corresponds to the slowest
       decay time (maximum). The second value must be equal to or greater than the first value.  Smaller  values
       result  in  a  faster  decay  of the cursor trail.  Adjust these values to control how quickly the cursor
       trail fades away.

       <b>cursor_trail_start_threshold</b>

          cursor_trail_start_threshold 2

       Set the distance threshold for starting the cursor trail. This option accepts a  positive  integer  value
       that  represents  the  minimum number of cells the cursor must move before the trail is started. When the
       cursor moves less than this threshold, the trail is skipped, reducing unnecessary cursor trail animation.

</pre><h4><b>Scrollback</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scrollback_lines</b>

          scrollback_lines 2000

       Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back. Memory is allocated on demand.  Negative
       numbers  are (effectively) infinite scrollback.  Note that using very large scrollback is not recommended
       as it can slow down performance of the terminal and also use large  amounts  of  RAM.  Instead,  consider
       using  <u>scrollback_pager_history_size</u>.  Note  that on config reload if this is changed it will only affect
       newly created windows, not existing ones.

       <b>scrollback_indicator_opacity</b>

          scrollback_indicator_opacity 1.0

       The opacity of the scrollback indicator which is a small colored rectangle that  moves  along  the  right
       hand  side  of  the  window as you scroll, indicating what fraction you have scrolled. The default is one
       which means fully opaque, aka visible.  Set to a value between zero and one to make  the  indicator  less
       visible.

       <b>scrollback_pager</b>

          scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER

       Program  with  which to view scrollback in a new window. The scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this
       program. If you change it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences for colors  and
       text formatting.  INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command line above will be replaced by an integer representing
       which  line  should be at the top of the screen. Similarly CURSOR_LINE and CURSOR_COLUMN will be replaced
       by the current cursor position or set to 0 if there is no cursor, for  example,  when  showing  the  last
       command output.

       <b>scrollback_pager_history_size</b>

          scrollback_pager_history_size 0

       Separate  scrollback  history size (in MB), used only for browsing the scrollback buffer with pager. This
       separate buffer is not available for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the  pager  program  when
       viewing  scrollback  buffer in a separate window. The current implementation stores the data in UTF-8, so
       approximately 10000 lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line, for pure ASCII, unformatted text.  A  value
       of  zero  or  less  disables this feature. The maximum allowed size is 4GB. Note that on config reload if
       this is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing ones.

       <b>scrollback_fill_enlarged_window</b>

          scrollback_fill_enlarged_window no

       Fill new space with lines from the scrollback buffer after enlarging a window.

       <b>wheel_scroll_multiplier</b>

          wheel_scroll_multiplier 5.0

       Multiplier for the number of lines scrolled by the mouse wheel. Note that  this  is  only  used  for  low
       precision  scrolling  devices,  not  for  high precision scrolling devices on platforms such as macOS and
       Wayland. Use negative numbers to change scroll direction. See also <u>wheel_scroll_min_lines</u>.

       <b>wheel_scroll_min_lines</b>

          wheel_scroll_min_lines 1

       The minimum number of lines scrolled by the mouse wheel. The <u>scroll</u> <u>multiplier</u> only takes effect after it
       reaches this number. Note that this is only used for low precision scrolling devices like wheel mice that
       scroll by very small amounts when using the wheel. With a negative number, the minimum  number  of  lines
       will always be added.

       <b>touch_scroll_multiplier</b>

          touch_scroll_multiplier 1.0

       Multiplier for the number of lines scrolled by a touchpad. Note that this is only used for high precision
       scrolling  devices  on  platforms  such  as  macOS  and  Wayland.  Use  negative numbers to change scroll
       direction.

</pre><h4><b>Mouse</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mouse_hide_wait</b>

          mouse_hide_wait 3.0

       Hide mouse cursor after the specified number of seconds of the mouse not  being  used.  Set  to  zero  to
       disable  mouse  cursor  hiding.  Set to a negative value to hide the mouse cursor immediately when typing
       text. Disabled by default on macOS as getting it to work robustly with the ever-changing sea of bugs that
       is Cocoa is too much effort.

       <b>url_color,</b> <b>url_style</b>

          url_color #0087bd
          url_style curly

       The color and style for highlighting URLs on mouse-over. <u>url_style</u> can be one of: <b>none</b>, <b>straight</b>, <b>double</b>,
       <b>curly</b>, <b>dotted</b>, <b>dashed</b>.

       <b>open_url_with</b>

          open_url_with default

       The program to open clicked URLs. The special value <b>default</b> will first look for any URL handlers  defined
       via  the  <u>Scripting</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>mouse</u>  <u>click</u>  facility and if non are found, it will use the Operating System's
       default URL handler (<b>open</b> on macOS and <b>xdg-open</b> on Linux).

       <b>url_prefixes</b>

          url_prefixes file ftp ftps gemini git gopher http https irc ircs kitty mailto news sftp ssh

       The set of URL prefixes to look for when detecting a URL under the mouse cursor.

       <b>detect_urls</b>

          detect_urls yes

       Detect URLs under the mouse. Detected URLs are highlighted with an underline and the mouse cursor becomes
       a  hand  over  them.  Even  if  this  option  is  disabled,  URLs  are  still  clickable.  See  also  the
       <u>underline_hyperlinks</u> option to control how hyperlinks (as opposed to plain text URLs) are displayed.

       <b>url_excluded_characters</b>

       Additional characters to be disallowed from URLs, when detecting URLs under the mouse cursor. By default,
       all  characters  that  are legal in URLs are allowed.  Additionally, newlines are allowed (but stripped).
       This is to accommodate programs such as mutt that add hard line breaks even for continued lines.  <b>\n</b>  can
       be  added  to  this  option to disable this behavior. Special characters can be specified using backslash
       escapes, to specify a backslash use a double backslash.

       <b>show_hyperlink_targets</b>

          show_hyperlink_targets no

       When the mouse hovers over a terminal hyperlink, show the actual URL that  will  be  activated  when  the
       hyperlink is clicked.

       <b>underline_hyperlinks</b>

          underline_hyperlinks hover

       Control  how  hyperlinks  are  underlined.  They  can  either  be underlined on mouse <b>hover</b>, <b>always</b> (i.e.
       permanently underlined) or <b>never</b> which  means  that  kitty  will  not  apply  any  underline  styling  to
       hyperlinks.  Note  that  the  value  of  <b>always</b>  only applies to real (OSC 8) hyperlinks not text that is
       detected to be a URL on mouse hover.  Uses the <u>url_style</u> and <u>url_color</u> settings for the underline  style.
       Note  that reloading the config and changing this value to/from <b>always</b> will only affect text subsequently
       received by kitty.

       <b>copy_on_select</b>

          copy_on_select no

       Copy to clipboard or a private buffer on select. With this set to  <b>clipboard</b>,  selecting  text  with  the
       mouse  will  cause the text to be copied to clipboard. Useful on platforms such as macOS that do not have
       the concept of primary selection. You can instead specify a name such as <b>a1</b> to copy to  a  private  kitty
       buffer. Map a shortcut with the <b>paste_from_buffer</b> action to paste from this private buffer.  For example:

          copy_on_select a1
          map shift+cmd+v paste_from_buffer a1

       Note  that  copying to the clipboard is a security risk, as all programs, including websites open in your
       browser can read the contents of the system clipboard.

       <b>clear_selection_on_clipboard_loss</b>

          clear_selection_on_clipboard_loss no

       When the contents of the clipboard no longer reflect the current selection, clear it.  This is  primarily
       useful  on  platforms  such  as  Linux where selecting text automatically copies it to a special "primary
       selection" clipboard or if you have <u>copy_on_select</u> set to <b>clipboard</b>.

       Note that on macOS the system does not provide notifications when the  clipboard  owner  is  changed,  so
       there,  copying  to clipboard in a non-kitty application will not clear selections even if <u>copy_on_select</u>
       is enabled.

       <b>paste_actions</b>

          paste_actions quote-urls-at-prompt,confirm

       A comma separated list of actions to take when pasting text  into  the  terminal.   The  supported  paste
       actions are:

       <b>quote-urls-at-prompt:</b>
              If the text being pasted is a URL and the cursor is at a shell prompt, automatically quote the URL
              (needs <u>shell_integration</u>).

       <b>replace-dangerous-control-codes</b>
              Replace dangerous control codes from pasted text, without confirmation.

       <b>replace-newline</b>
              Replace the newline character from pasted text, without confirmation.

       <b>confirm:</b>
              Confirm  the  paste  if  the  text to be pasted contains any terminal control codes as this can be
              dangerous, leading to code execution if  the  shell/program  running  in  the  terminal  does  not
              properly handle these.

       <b>confirm-if-large</b>
              Confirm  the  paste  if  it is very large (larger than 16KB) as pasting large amounts of text into
              shells can be very slow.

       <b>filter:</b>
              Run the filter_paste() function from the file <b>paste-actions.py</b> in the kitty  config  directory  on
              the pasted text. The text returned by the function will be actually pasted.

       <b>no-op:</b> Has no effect.

       <b>strip_trailing_spaces</b>

          strip_trailing_spaces never

       Remove  spaces  at  the  end  of  lines when copying to clipboard. A value of <b>smart</b> will do it when using
       normal selections, but not rectangle selections. A value of <b>always</b> will always do it.

       <b>select_by_word_characters</b>

          select_by_word_characters @-./_~?&amp;=%+#

       Characters considered part of a word when double clicking. In addition to these characters any  character
       that is marked as an alphanumeric character in the Unicode database will be matched.

       <b>select_by_word_characters_forward</b>

       Characters considered part of a word when extending the selection forward on double clicking. In addition
       to  these  characters  any  character that is marked as an alphanumeric character in the Unicode database
       will be matched.

       If empty (default) <u>select_by_word_characters</u> will be used for both directions.

       <b>click_interval</b>

          click_interval -1.0

       The interval between successive clicks to detect double/triple clicks (in seconds). Negative numbers will
       use the system default instead, if available, or fallback to 0.5.

       <b>focus_follows_mouse</b>

          focus_follows_mouse no

       Set the active window to the window under the mouse when moving the mouse around.  On  macOS,  this  will
       also cause the OS Window under the mouse to be focused automatically when the mouse enters it.

       <b>pointer_shape_when_grabbed</b>

          pointer_shape_when_grabbed arrow

       The shape of the mouse pointer when the program running in the terminal grabs the mouse.

       <b>default_pointer_shape</b>

          default_pointer_shape beam

       The default shape of the mouse pointer.

       <b>pointer_shape_when_dragging</b>

          pointer_shape_when_dragging beam crosshair

       The  default  shape  of  the  mouse pointer when dragging across text. The optional second value sets the
       shape when dragging in rectangular selection mode.

   <b>Mouse</b> <b>actions</b>
       Mouse buttons can be mapped to perform arbitrary actions. The syntax is:

          mouse_map button-name event-type modes action

       Where <b>button-name</b> is one of <b>left</b>, <b>middle</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>b1</b> ... <b>b8</b> with added keyboard  modifiers.  For  example:
       <b>ctrl+shift+left</b>  refers  to  holding  the  <b>Ctrl</b>+<b>Shift</b> keys while clicking with the left mouse button. The
       value <b>b1</b> ... <b>b8</b> can be used to refer to up to eight buttons on a mouse.

       <b>event-type</b> is one of <b>press</b>, <b>release</b>,  <b>doublepress</b>,  <b>triplepress</b>,  <b>click</b>,  <b>doubleclick</b>.   <b>modes</b>  indicates
       whether the action is performed when the mouse is grabbed by the program running in the terminal, or not.
       The values are <b>grabbed</b> or <b>ungrabbed</b> or a comma separated combination of them.  <b>grabbed</b> refers to when the
       program  running  in the terminal has requested mouse events. Note that the click and double click events
       have a delay of <u>click_interval</u> to disambiguate from double and triple presses.

       You can run kitty with the <u>kitty</u> <u>--debug-input</u> command line option to see mouse events. See  the  builtin
       actions below to get a sense of what is possible.

       If  you  want  to unmap a button, map it to nothing. For example, to disable opening of URLs with a plain
       click:

          mouse_map left click ungrabbed

       See all the mappable actions including mouse actions <u>here</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Once a selection is started, releasing the button that started it will automatically  end  it  and  no
          release event will be dispatched.

       <b>clear_all_mouse_actions</b>

          clear_all_mouse_actions no

       Remove  all  mouse action definitions up to this point. Useful, for instance, to remove the default mouse
       actions.

       <b>Click</b> <b>the</b> <b>link</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>or</b> <b>move</b> <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b>

          mouse_map left click ungrabbed mouse_handle_click selection link prompt

       First check for a selection and if one exists do nothing. Then check for a link under  the  mouse  cursor
       and  if  one exists, click it. Finally check if the click happened at the current shell prompt and if so,
       move the cursor to the click location. Note that this requires <u>shell</u> <u>integration</u> to work.

       <b>Click</b> <b>the</b> <b>link</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>or</b> <b>move</b> <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>grabbed</b>

          mouse_map shift+left click grabbed,ungrabbed mouse_handle_click selection link prompt

       Same as above, except that the action is performed even when the mouse is grabbed by the program  running
       in the terminal.

       <b>Click</b> <b>the</b> <b>link</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>cursor</b>

          mouse_map ctrl+shift+left release grabbed,ungrabbed mouse_handle_click link

       Variant  with  <b>Ctrl</b>+<b>Shift</b>  is  present because the simple click based version has an unavoidable delay of
       <u>click_interval</u>, to disambiguate clicks from double clicks.

       <b>Discard</b> <b>press</b> <b>event</b> <b>for</b> <b>link</b> <b>click</b>

          mouse_map ctrl+shift+left press grabbed discard_event

       Prevent this press event from being sent to the program that has grabbed the mouse, as the  corresponding
       release event is used to open a URL.

       <b>Paste</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>selection</b>

          mouse_map middle release ungrabbed paste_from_selection

       <b>Start</b> <b>selecting</b> <b>text</b>

       <b>Select</b> <b>line</b> <b>from</b> <b>point</b>

          mouse_map ctrl+alt+left triplepress ungrabbed mouse_selection line_from_point

       Select  from  the clicked point to the end of the line. If you would like to select the word at the point
       and then extend to the rest of the line, change <u>line_from_point</u> to <u>word_and_line_from_point</u>.

       <b>Extend</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>selection</b>

          mouse_map right press ungrabbed mouse_selection extend

       If you want only the end of the selection to be moved instead  of  the  nearest  boundary,  use  <b>move-end</b>
       instead of <b>extend</b>.

       <b>Paste</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>selection</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>grabbed</b>

          mouse_map shift+middle release ungrabbed,grabbed paste_selection

          mouse_map ctrl+shift+alt+left triplepress ungrabbed,grabbed mouse_selection line_from_point

       Select  from  the clicked point to the end of the line even when grabbed. If you would like to select the
       word  at  the  point  and  then  extend  to  the  rest   of   the   line,   change   <u>line_from_point</u>   to
       <u>word_and_line_from_point</u>.

       <b>Extend</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>selection</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>grabbed</b>

          mouse_map ctrl+shift+right press ungrabbed mouse_show_command_output

       Requires <u>shell</u> <u>integration</u> to work.

</pre><h4><b>Performance</b> <b>tuning</b></h4><pre>
       <b>repaint_delay</b>

          repaint_delay 10

       Delay  between  screen updates (in milliseconds). Decreasing it, increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the
       cost of more CPU usage. The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient  for  most  uses.
       Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS, you have to either set <u>sync_to_monitor</u> to <b>no</b> or use a monitor with
       a  high  refresh rate. Also, to minimize latency when there is pending input to be processed, this option
       is ignored.

       <b>input_delay</b>

          input_delay 3

       Delay before input from the program running in the terminal is processed  (in  milliseconds).  Note  that
       decreasing  it  will increase responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker in full
       screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop, because kitty is so fast that partial  screen
       updates will be drawn. This setting is ignored when the input buffer is almost full.

       <b>sync_to_monitor</b>

          sync_to_monitor yes

       Sync  screen  updates  to  the  refresh rate of the monitor. This prevents <u>screen</u> <u>tearing</u> when scrolling.
       However, it limits the rendering speed to the refresh rate of  your  monitor.  With  a  very  high  speed
       mouse/high keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency. If so, set this to <b>no</b>.

</pre><h4><b>Terminal</b> <b>bell</b></h4><pre>
       <b>enable_audio_bell</b>

          enable_audio_bell yes

       The audio bell. Useful to disable it in environments that require silence.

       <b>visual_bell_duration</b>

          visual_bell_duration 0.0

       The  visual  bell  duration (in seconds). Flash the screen when a bell occurs for the specified number of
       seconds. Set to zero to disable. The flash is animated, fading in and out over  the  specified  duration.
       The <u>easing</u> <u>function</u> used for the fading can be controlled.  For example, <b>2.0</b> <b>linear</b> will casuse the flash
       to  fade  in and out linearly. The default if unspecified is to use <b>ease-in-out</b> which fades slowly at the
       start, middle and end.  You can specify different easing functions for the fade-in  and  fade-out  parts,
       like this: <b>2.0</b> <b>ease-in</b> <b>linear</b>. kitty supports all the <u>CSS</u> <u>easing</u> <u>functions</u>.

       <b>visual_bell_color</b>

          visual_bell_color none

       The color used by visual bell. Set to <b>none</b> will fall back to selection background color. If you feel that
       the visual bell is too bright, you can set it to a darker color.

       <b>window_alert_on_bell</b>

          window_alert_on_bell yes

       Request window attention on bell. Makes the dock icon bounce on macOS or the taskbar flash on Linux.

       <b>bell_on_tab</b>

          bell_on_tab "🔔 "

       Some  text  or  a Unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the tab that does not have focus has a
       bell.  If  you  want  to  use  leading  or  trailing  spaces,  surround  the  text   with   quotes.   See
       <u>tab_title_template</u> for how this is rendered.

       For  backwards  compatibility, values of <b>yes</b>, <b>y</b> and <b>true</b> are converted to the default bell symbol and <b>no</b>,
       <b>n</b>, <b>false</b> and <b>none</b> are converted to the empty string.

       <b>command_on_bell</b>

          command_on_bell none

       Program to run when a bell occurs. The environment variable <u>KITTY_CHILD_CMDLINE</u> can be used  to  get  the
       program running in the window in which the bell occurred.

       <b>bell_path</b>

          bell_path none

       Path  to  a  sound file to play as the bell sound. If set to <b>none</b>, the system default bell sound is used.
       Must be in a format supported by  the  operating  systems  sound  API,  such  as  WAV  or  OGA  on  Linux
       (libcanberra) or AIFF, MP3 or WAV on macOS (NSSound).

       <b>linux_bell_theme</b>

          linux_bell_theme __custom

       The  XDG  Sound Theme kitty will use to play the bell sound.  Defaults to the custom theme name specified
       in the <u>XDG</u> <u>Sound</u> <u>theme</u> <u>specification</u> with the contents:
          [Sound Theme]

          Inherits=name-of-the-sound-theme-you-want-to-use

       Replace  <b>name-of-the-sound-theme-you-want-to-use</b>  with  the  actual  theme  name.   Now   all   compliant
       applications should use sounds from this theme.

</pre><h4><b>Window</b> <b>layout</b></h4><pre>
       <b>remember_window_size,</b> <b>initial_window_width,</b> <b>initial_window_height</b>

          remember_window_size  yes
          initial_window_width  640
          initial_window_height 400

       If  enabled, the <u>OS</u> <u>Window</u> size will be remembered so that new instances of kitty will have the same size
       as the  previous  instance.   If  disabled,  the  <u>OS</u>  <u>Window</u>  will  initially  have  size  configured  by
       initial_window_width/height,  in  pixels.  You can use a suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have
       them interpreted as number of cells instead of pixels.

       <b>enabled_layouts</b>

          enabled_layouts *

       The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.  The  special  value  <b>all</b>  means  all
       layouts. The first listed layout will be used as the startup layout. Default configuration is all layouts
       in alphabetical order. For a list of available layouts, see the <u>Layouts</u>.

       <b>window_resize_step_cells,</b> <b>window_resize_step_lines</b>

          window_resize_step_cells 2
          window_resize_step_lines 2

       The  step  size  (in units of cell width/cell height) to use when resizing kitty windows in a layout with
       the shortcut <u>ctrl+shift+r</u>. The cells value is used for horizontal resizing, and the lines value  is  used
       for vertical resizing.

       <b>window_border_width</b>

          window_border_width 0.5pt

       The  width  of window borders. Can be either in pixels (px) or pts (pt). Values in pts will be rounded to
       the nearest number of pixels based on screen resolution.  If not specified, the unit  is  assumed  to  be
       pts.  Note  that  borders  are  displayed  only  when  more than one window is visible. They are meant to
       separate multiple windows.

       <b>draw_minimal_borders</b>

          draw_minimal_borders yes

       Draw only the minimum borders needed. This means that only the borders that separate the  window  from  a
       neighbor  are  drawn.  Note  that  setting  a  non-zero <u>window_margin_width</u> overrides this and causes all
       borders to be drawn.

       <b>window_margin_width</b>

          window_margin_width 0

       The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border). A single  value  sets  all  four  sides.  Two
       values  set  the  vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four values
       set top, right, bottom and left.

       <b>single_window_margin_width</b>

          single_window_margin_width -1

       The window margin to use when only a single window is visible (in pts). Negative values  will  cause  the
       value  of  <u>window_margin_width</u> to be used instead. A single value sets all four sides. Two values set the
       vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four values set  top,  right,
       bottom and left.

       <b>window_padding_width</b>

          window_padding_width 0

       The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the window border).  A single value sets all
       four  sides.  Two  values  set  the  vertical  and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and
       bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

       <b>single_window_padding_width</b>

          single_window_padding_width -1

       The window padding to use when only a single window is visible (in pts). Negative values will  cause  the
       value  of <u>window_padding_width</u> to be used instead. A single value sets all four sides. Two values set the
       vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four values set  top,  right,
       bottom and left.

       <b>placement_strategy</b>

          placement_strategy center

       When the window size is not an exact multiple of the cell size, the cell area of the terminal window will
       have  some  extra padding on the sides. You can control how that padding is distributed with this option.
       Using a value of <b>center</b> means the cell area will be placed centrally.  A  value  of  <b>top-left</b>  means  the
       padding  will  be only at the bottom and right edges.  The value can be one of: <b>top-left</b>, <b>top</b>, <b>top-right</b>,
       <b>left</b>, <b>center</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>bottom-left</b>, <b>bottom</b>, <b>bottom-right</b>.

       <b>active_border_color</b>

          active_border_color #00ff00

       The color for the border of the active window. Set this to <b>none</b> to not draw  borders  around  the  active
       window.

       <b>inactive_border_color</b>

          inactive_border_color #cccccc

       The color for the border of inactive windows.

       <b>bell_border_color</b>

          bell_border_color #ff5a00

       The color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has occurred.

       <b>inactive_text_alpha</b>

          inactive_text_alpha 1.0

       Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number between zero and one, with zero being
       fully faded).

       <b>hide_window_decorations</b>

          hide_window_decorations no

       Hide  the  window  decorations  (title-bar  and  window  borders)  with  <b>yes</b>. On macOS, <b>titlebar-only</b> and
       <b>titlebar-and-corners</b> can be used to only hide the titlebar and the rounded corners.  Whether  this  works
       and  exactly  what effect it has depends on the window manager/operating system. Note that the effects of
       changing this option when reloading config are undefined. When using <b>titlebar-only</b>, it is useful to  also
       set  <u>window_margin_width</u> and <u>placement_strategy</u> to prevent the rounded corners from clipping text. Or use
       <b>titlebar-and-corners</b>.

       <b>window_logo_path</b>

          window_logo_path none

       Path to a logo image. Must be  in  PNG/JPEG/WEBP/GIF/TIFF/BMP  format.  Relative  paths  are  interpreted
       relative  to  the  kitty  config  directory. The logo is displayed in a corner of every kitty window. The
       position is controlled by <u>window_logo_position</u>.  Individual windows can be configured to  have  different
       logos either using the <u>launch</u> action or the <u>remote</u> <u>control</u> facility.

       <b>window_logo_position</b>

          window_logo_position bottom-right

       Where to position the window logo in the window. The value can be one of: <b>top-left</b>, <b>top</b>, <b>top-right</b>, <b>left</b>,
       <b>center</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>bottom-left</b>, <b>bottom</b>, <b>bottom-right</b>.

       <b>window_logo_alpha</b>

          window_logo_alpha 0.5

       The  amount the logo should be faded into the background. With zero being fully faded and one being fully
       opaque.

       <b>window_logo_scale</b>

          window_logo_scale 0

       The percentage (0-100] of the window size to which the logo should scale. Using a single number means the
       logo is scaled to that percentage of the shortest window dimension, while preserving aspect ratio of  the
       logo image.

       Using  two  numbers means the width and height of the logo are scaled to the respective percentage of the
       window's width and height.

       Using zero as the percentage disables scaling in that dimension. A single zero (the default) disables all
       scaling of the window logo.

       <b>resize_debounce_time</b>

          resize_debounce_time 0.1 0.5

       The time to wait (in seconds) before asking the program running in kitty to resize and redraw the  screen
       during  a  live resize of the OS window, when no new resize events have been received, i.e. when resizing
       is either paused or finished.  On platforms such as  macOS,  where  the  operating  system  sends  events
       corresponding  to  the  start  and end of a live resize, the second number is used for redraw-after-pause
       since kitty can distinguish between a pause and end of resizing. On such  systems  the  first  number  is
       ignored  and  redraw  is immediate after end of resize. On other systems only the first number is used so
       that kitty is "ready" quickly after the end of resizing, while not also continuously redrawing,  to  save
       energy.

       <b>resize_in_steps</b>

          resize_in_steps no

       Resize  the  OS window in steps as large as the cells, instead of with the usual pixel accuracy. Combined
       with <u>initial_window_width</u> and <u>initial_window_height</u> in number of cells, this option can be used  to  keep
       the  margins  as small as possible when resizing the OS window. Note that this does not currently work on
       Wayland.

       <b>visual_window_select_characters</b>

          visual_window_select_characters 1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

       The list of characters for visual window selection. For example, for selecting a window to focus on  with
       <u>ctrl+shift+f7</u>.  The  value  should be a series of unique numbers or alphabets, case insensitive, from the
       set <b>0-9A-Z`-=[];',./\</b>.  Specify your preference as a string of characters.

       <b>confirm_os_window_close</b>

          confirm_os_window_close -1

       Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab with at least this number of kitty windows in  it
       by  window  manager  (e.g.  clicking the window close button or pressing the operating system shortcut to
       close windows) or by the <u>close_tab</u> action. A value of zero disables confirmation. This confirmation  also
       applies to requests to quit the entire application (all OS windows, via the <u>quit</u> action). Negative values
       are  converted  to  positive  ones,  however, with <u>shell_integration</u> enabled, using negative values means
       windows sitting at a shell prompt are not counted, only windows where some command is currently  running.
       You  can  also  have  backgrounded  jobs  prevent closing, by adding <b>count-background</b> to the setting, for
       example: <b>-1</b> <b>count-background</b>.  Note that if you want confirmation when closing  individual  windows,  you
       can map the <u>close_window_with_confirmation</u> action.

          tab_bar_margin_height 0.0 0.0

       The  margin  above and below the tab bar (in pts). The first number is the margin between the edge of the
       OS Window and the tab bar. The second number is the margin between the tab bar and the  contents  of  the
       current tab.

       <b>tab_bar_style</b>

          tab_bar_style fade

       The tab bar style, can be one of:

       <b>fade</b>   Each tab's edges fade into the background color. (See also <u>tab_fade</u>)

       <b>slant</b>  Tabs look like the tabs in a physical file.

       <b>powerline</b>
              Tabs are shown as a continuous line with "fancy" separators.  (See also <u>tab_powerline_style</u>)

       <b>custom</b> A  user-supplied  Python  function called draw_tab is loaded from the file <b>tab_bar.py</b> in the kitty
              config directory. For examples  of  how  to  write  such  a  function,  see  the  functions  named
              <b>draw_tab_with_*</b>  in  kitty's  source code: <b>kitty/tab_bar.py</b>. See also <u>this</u> <u>discussion</u> for examples
              from kitty users.

       <b>hidden</b> The tab bar is hidden. If you use this, you might want to create  a  mapping  for  the  <u>select_tab</u>
              action which presents you with a list of tabs and allows for easy switching to a tab.

       <b>tab_bar_align</b>

          tab_bar_align left

       The horizontal alignment of the tab bar, can be one of: <b>left</b>, <b>center</b>, <b>right</b>.

       <b>tab_bar_min_tabs</b>

          tab_bar_min_tabs 2

       The minimum number of tabs that must exist before the tab bar is shown.

       <b>tab_switch_strategy</b>

          tab_switch_strategy previous

       The algorithm to use when switching to a tab when the current tab is closed. The default of <b>previous</b> will
       switch  to  the  last  used  tab. A value of <b>left</b> will switch to the tab to the left of the closed tab. A
       value of <b>right</b> will switch to the tab to the right of the closed tab. A value of <b>last</b> will switch to  the
       right-most tab.

       <b>tab_fade</b>

          tab_fade 0.25 0.5 0.75 1

       Control  how  each tab fades into the background when using <b>fade</b> for the <u>tab_bar_style</u>. Each number is an
       alpha (between zero and one) that controls how much the corresponding cell  fades  into  the  background,
       with  zero  being  no  fade  and  one  being  full  fade.  You  can  change  the  number of cells used by
       adding/removing entries to this list.

       <b>tab_separator</b>

          tab_separator " ┇"

       The separator between tabs in the tab bar when using <b>separator</b> as the <u>tab_bar_style</u>.

       <b>tab_powerline_style</b>

          tab_powerline_style angled

       The powerline separator style between tabs in the tab bar when using <b>powerline</b> as the <u>tab_bar_style</u>,  can
       be one of: <b>angled</b>, <b>slanted</b>, <b>round</b>.

       <b>tab_activity_symbol</b>

          tab_activity_symbol none

       Some text or a Unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the tab that does not have focus has some
       activity.  If  you  want  to  use  leading  or  trailing  spaces,  surround  the  text  with  quotes. See
       <u>tab_title_template</u> for how this is rendered.

       <b>tab_title_max_length</b>

          tab_title_max_length 0

       The maximum number of cells that can be used to render the text in a tab.  A value of zero means that  no
       limit is applied.

       <b>tab_title_template</b>

          tab_title_template "{fmt.fg.red}{bell_symbol}{activity_symbol}{fmt.fg.tab}{tab.last_focused_progress_percent}{title}"

       A template to render the tab title. The default just renders the title with optional symbols for bell and
       activity.  If  you  wish to include the tab-index as well, use something like: <b>{index}:{title}</b>. Useful if
       you have shortcuts mapped for <b>goto_tab</b> <b>N</b>.  If  you  prefer  to  see  the  index  as  a  superscript,  use
       <b>{sup.index}</b>. All data available is:

       <b>title</b>  The current tab title.

       <b>index</b>  The tab index usable with <u>goto_tab</u> <u>N</u> shortcuts.

       <b>layout_name</b>
              The current layout name.

       <b>num_windows</b>
              The number of windows in the tab.

       <b>num_window_groups</b>
              The  number  of  window  groups (a window group is a window and all of its overlay windows) in the
              tab.

       <b>tab.active_wd</b>
              The working directory of the currently active window in the tab (expensive, requires syscall). Use
              <b>tab.active_oldest_wd</b> to get the directory of the oldest foreground process rather than the newest.

       <b>tab.active_exe</b>
              The name of the executable running in the foreground of the currently active  window  in  the  tab
              (expensive, requires syscall). Use <b>tab.active_oldest_exe</b> for the oldest foreground process.

       <b>max_title_length</b>
              The maximum title length available.

       <b>keyboard_mode</b>
              The name of the current <u>keyboard</u> <u>mode</u> or the empty string if no keyboard mode is active.

       <b>tab.last_focused_progress_percent</b>
              If  a  command  running  in  a  window  reports  the  progress for a task, show this progress as a
              percentage from the most recently focused window in the  tab.  Empty  string  if  no  progress  is
              reported.

       <b>tab.progress_percent</b>
              If  a  command  running  in  a  window  reports  the  progress for a task, show this progress as a
              percentage from all windows in the tab, averaged. Empty string is no progress is reported.

       Note that formatting is done by Python's string formatting machinery,  so  you  can  use,  for  instance,
       <b>{layout_name[:2].upper()}</b> to show only the first two letters of the layout name, upper-cased. If you want
       to      style      the     text,     you     can     use     styling     directives,     for     example:
       <b>{fmt.fg.red}red{fmt.fg.tab}normal{fmt.bg._00FF00}greenbg{fmt.bg.tab}</b>.  Similarly, for  bold  and  italic:
       <b>{fmt.bold}bold{fmt.nobold}normal{fmt.italic}italic{fmt.noitalic}</b>.   The  256 eight terminal colors can be
       used as <b>fmt.fg.color0</b> through <b>fmt.fg.color255</b>.  Note that for backward compatibility, if <b>{bell_symbol}</b> or
       <b>{activity_symbol}</b> are not present in the template, they are prepended to it.

       <b>active_tab_title_template</b>

          active_tab_title_template none

       Template to use for active tabs. If not specified falls back to <u>tab_title_template</u>.

       <b>active_tab_foreground,</b> <b>active_tab_background,</b> <b>active_tab_font_style,</b> <b>inactive_tab_foreground,</b>
       <b>inactive_tab_background,</b> <b>inactive_tab_font_style</b>

          active_tab_foreground   #000
          active_tab_background   #eee
          active_tab_font_style   bold-italic
          inactive_tab_foreground #444
          inactive_tab_background #999
          inactive_tab_font_style normal

       Tab bar colors and styles.

       <b>tab_bar_background</b>

          tab_bar_background none

       Background color for the tab bar. Defaults to using the terminal background color.

       <b>tab_bar_margin_color</b>

          tab_bar_margin_color none

       Color for the tab bar margin area. Defaults to using the terminal background color for margins above  and
       below  the  tab  bar.  For  side margins the default color is chosen to match the background color of the
       neighboring tab.

</pre><h4><b>Color</b> <b>scheme</b></h4><pre>
       <b>foreground,</b> <b>background</b>

          foreground #dddddd
          background #000000

       The foreground and background colors.

       <b>background_opacity</b>

          background_opacity 1.0

       The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where one  is  opaque  and  zero  is  fully
       transparent.  This  will  only  work  if supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
       X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in cells that have the same background  color
       as  the  default  terminal background, so that things like the status bar in vim, powerline prompts, etc.
       still look good. But it means that if you use a color theme with a background color in  your  editor,  it
       will not be rendered as transparent. Instead you should change the default background color in your kitty
       config  and  not  use  a  background color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set the
       terminals default colors in a shell script to launch your editor. See also <u>transparent_background_colors</u>.
       Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly significant) performance hit. When using  a  low
       value  for  this  setting,  it  is desirable that you set the <u>background</u> color to a color the matches the
       general color of the desktop background, for best text rendering. Note that to workaround window managers
       not doing gamma-corrected blending kitty makes background_opacity non-linear which means, especially  for
       light  backgrounds you might need to make the value much lower than you expect to get good results, see ‐
       <u>#6218</u> for details.

       If you want to dynamically change transparency of windows, set <u>dynamic_background_opacity</u> to <b>yes</b> (this is
       off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing this option when reloading the  config  will  only
       work if <u>dynamic_background_opacity</u> was enabled in the original config.

       <b>background_blur</b>

          background_blur 0

       Set  to  a positive value to enable background blur (blurring of the visuals behind a transparent window)
       on platforms that support it. Only takes effect when <u>background_opacity</u> is less than one. On macOS,  this
       will  also control the blur radius (amount of blurring). Setting it to too high a value will cause severe
       performance issues and/or rendering artifacts.  Usually, values up to 64 work well. Note that this  might
       cause  performance  issues,  depending  on  how  the  platform implements it, so use with care. Currently
       supported on macOS and KDE.

       <b>background_image</b>

          background_image none

       Path to a background image. Must be in PNG/JPEG/WEBP/TIFF/GIF/BMP format.

       <b>background_image_layout</b>

          background_image_layout tiled

       Whether to tile, scale or clamp the background image. The  value  can  be  one  of  <b>tiled</b>,  <b>mirror-tiled</b>,
       <b>scaled</b>,  <b>clamped</b>,  <b>centered</b> or <b>cscaled</b>. The <b>scaled</b> and <b>cscaled</b> values scale the image to the window size,
       with <b>cscaled</b> preserving the image aspect ratio.

       <b>background_image_linear</b>

          background_image_linear no

       When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation should be used.

       <b>transparent_background_colors</b>

       A space separated list of upto 7 colors, with opacity. When the background color of a cell matches one of
       these colors, it is rendered semi-transparent using the specified opacity.

       Useful in more complex UIs like editors where you could want more than a single background  color  to  be
       rendered  as  transparent,  for  instance, for a cursor highlight line background or a highlighted block.
       Terminal applications can set this color using <u>The</u> <u>kitty</u> <u>color</u> <u>control</u> escape code.

       The syntax  for  specifying  colors  is:  <b>color@opacity</b>,  where  the  <b>@opacity</b>  part  is  optional.  When
       unspecified, the value of <u>background_opacity</u> is used. For example:

          transparent_background_colors <a href="mailto:red@0.5">red@0.5</a> #<a href="mailto:00ff00@0.3">00ff00@0.3</a>

       <b>dynamic_background_opacity</b>

          dynamic_background_opacity no

       Allow changing of the <u>background_opacity</u> dynamically, using either keyboard shortcuts (<u>ctrl+shift+a&gt;m</u> and
       <u>ctrl+shift+a&gt;l</u>)  or  the  remote  control  facility.  Changing this option by reloading the config is not
       supported.

       <b>background_tint</b>

          background_tint 0.0

       How much to tint the background image by the background color. This option makes it easier  to  read  the
       text.  Tinting  is  done  using the current background color for each window. This option applies only if
       <u>background_opacity</u> is set and transparent windows are supported or <u>background_image</u> is set.

       <b>background_tint_gaps</b>

          background_tint_gaps 1.0

       How much to tint the background image at  the  window  gaps  by  the  background  color,  after  applying
       <u>background_tint</u>.  Since  this  is multiplicative with <u>background_tint</u>, it can be used to lighten the tint
       over the window gaps for a <u>separated</u> look.

       <b>dim_opacity</b>

          dim_opacity 0.4

       How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One means no  dimming  and  zero  means  fully
       dimmed (i.e. invisible).

       <b>selection_foreground,</b> <b>selection_background</b>

          selection_foreground #000000
          selection_background #fffacd

       The foreground and background colors for text selected with the mouse. Setting both of these to <b>none</b> will
       cause  a  "reverse  video" effect for selections, where the selection will be the cell text color and the
       text will become the cell background color. Setting only selection_foreground  to  <b>none</b>  will  cause  the
       foreground color to be used unchanged. Note that these colors can be overridden by the program running in
       the terminal.

   <b>The</b> <b>color</b> <b>table</b>
       The  256  terminal  colors.  There  are 8 basic colors, each color has a dull and bright version, for the
       first 16 colors. You can set the remaining 240 colors as color16 to color255.

       <b>color0,</b> <b>color8</b>

          color0 #000000
          color8 #767676

       black

       <b>color1,</b> <b>color9</b>

          color1 #cc0403

       <b>shell</b>

          shell .

       The shell program to execute. The default value of <b>.</b> means to use the value of of the  <u>SHELL</u>  environment
       variable or if unset, whatever shell is set as the default shell for the current user. Note that on macOS
       if  you  change  this, you might need to add <b>--login</b> and <b>--interactive</b> to ensure that the shell starts in
       interactive mode and reads its startup rc files. Environment variables are expanded in this setting.

       <b>editor</b>

          editor .

       The terminal based text editor (such as <b>vim</b> or <b>nano</b>) to use when editing the kitty config file or similar
       tasks.

       The default value of <b>.</b> means to use the environment variables <u>VISUAL</u> and <u>EDITOR</u> in that order.  If  these
       variables  aren't  set,  kitty  will run your <u>shell</u> (<b>$SHELL</b> <b>-l</b> <b>-i</b> <b>-c</b> <b>env</b>) to see if your shell startup rc
       files set <u>VISUAL</u> or <u>EDITOR</u>. If that doesn't work, kitty will cycle through various  known  editors  (<b>vim</b>,
       <b>emacs</b>, etc.) and take the first one that exists on your system.

       <b>close_on_child_death</b>

          close_on_child_death no

       Close  the  window  when  the  child  process  (usually  the shell) exits. With the default value <b>no</b>, the
       terminal will remain open when the child exits as long as there are still other processes  outputting  to
       the  terminal  (for  example  disowned or backgrounded processes). When enabled with <b>yes</b>, the window will
       close as soon as the child process exits. Note that setting it to <b>yes</b> means that any background processes
       still using the terminal can fail silently because their stdout/stderr/stdin no longer work.

       <b>remote_control_password</b>

       Allow other programs to control kitty using passwords. This option can be specified multiple times to add
       multiple passwords. If no passwords are present kitty will ask the user for permission if a program tries
       to use remote control with a password. A password can also <u>optionally</u> be associated with a set of allowed
       remote control actions. For example:

          remote_control_password "my passphrase" get-colors set-colors focus-window focus-tab

       Only the specified actions will be allowed when using this password.  Glob patterns can be used too,  for
       example:

          remote_control_password "my passphrase" set-tab-* resize-*

       To get a list of available actions, run:

          kitten @ --help

       A  set of actions to be allowed when no password is sent can be specified by using an empty password. For
       example:

          remote_control_password "" *-colors

       Finally, the path to a python module can be specified that provides a  function  <b>is_cmd_allowed</b>  that  is
       used to check every remote control command.  For example:

          remote_control_password "my passphrase" my_rc_command_checker.py

       Relative  paths  are resolved from the kitty configuration directory.  See <u>Customizing</u> <u>authorization</u> <u>with</u>
       <u>your</u> <u>own</u> <u>program</u> for details.

       <b>allow_remote_control</b>

          allow_remote_control no

       Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on, other programs can  control  all  aspects  of
       kitty, including sending text to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the content
       of  windows,  etc. Note that this even works over SSH connections. The default setting of <b>no</b> prevents any
       form of remote control. The meaning of the various values are:

       <b>password</b>
              Remote control requests received over both the TTY device and the socket are  confirmed  based  on
              passwords, see <u>remote_control_password</u>.

       <b>socket-only</b>
              Remote  control  requests  received  over a socket are accepted unconditionally. Requests received
              over the TTY are denied.  See <u>listen_on</u>.

       <b>socket</b> Remote control requests received over a socket are  accepted  unconditionally.  Requests  received
              over the TTY are confirmed based on password.

       <b>no</b>     Remote control is completely disabled.

       <b>yes</b>    Remote control requests are always accepted.

       <b>listen_on</b>

          listen_on none

       Listen  to  the  specified  socket for remote control connections. Note that this will apply to all kitty
       instances. It can be overridden by the <u>kitty</u> <u>--listen-on</u> command line option. For UNIX sockets,  such  as
       <b>unix:${TEMP}/mykitty</b>  or  <b>unix:@mykitty</b> (on Linux). Environment variables are expanded and relative paths
       are resolved with respect to the temporary directory. If <b>{kitty_pid}</b> is present, then it is  replaced  by
       the  PID  of  the  kitty process, otherwise the PID of the kitty process is appended to the value, with a
       hyphen. For TCP sockets such as <b>tcp:localhost:0</b> a random port is always used  even  if  a  non-zero  port
       number is specified.  See the help for <u>kitty</u> <u>--listen-on</u> for more details. Note that this will be ignored
       unless  <u>allow_remote_control</u>  is  set  to  either:  <b>yes</b>,  <b>socket</b> or <b>socket-only</b>.  Changing this option by
       reloading the config is not supported.

       <b>env</b>

       Specify the environment variables to be set in all child processes. Using the name  with  an  equal  sign
       (e.g. <b>env</b> <b>VAR=</b>) will set it to the empty string.  Specifying only the name (e.g. <b>env</b> <b>VAR</b>) will remove the
       variable  from  the child process' environment. Note that environment variables are expanded recursively,
       for example:

          env VAR1=a
          env VAR2=${HOME}/${VAR1}/b

       The value of <b>VAR2</b> will be <b>&lt;path</b> <b>to</b> <b>home</b> <b>directory&gt;/a/b</b>.

       <b>filter_notification</b>

       Specify rules to filter out notifications sent by  applications  running  in  kitty.   Can  be  specified
       multiple  times  to  create  multiple  filter  rules. A rule specification is of the form <b>field:regexp</b>. A
       filter rule can match on any of the fields: <b>title</b>, <b>body</b>, <b>app</b>, <b>type</b>.  The special value of <b>all</b> filters out
       all notifications. Rules can be combined using Boolean operators. Some examples:

          filter_notification title:hello or body:"abc.*def"
          # filter out notification from vim except for ones about updates, (?i)
          # makes matching case insensitive.
          filter_notification app:"[ng]?vim" and not body:"(?i)update"
          # filter out all notifications
          filter_notification all

       The field <b>app</b> is the name of the application sending the  notification  and  <b>type</b>  is  the  type  of  the
       notification. Not all applications will send these fields, so you can also match on the title and body of
       the  notification text. More sophisticated programmatic filtering and custom actions on notifications can
       be done by creating a notifications.py file in the kitty config directory (<b><a href="file:~/.config/kitty">~/.config/kitty</a></b>). An annotated
       sample is <u>available</u>.

       <b>watcher</b>

       Path to python file which will be loaded for <u>Watching</u> <u>launched</u> <u>windows</u>. Can be specified more  than  once
       to  load multiple watchers. The watchers will be added to every kitty window. Relative paths are resolved
       relative to the kitty config directory. Note that reloading the config will only affect  windows  created
       after the reload.

       <b>exe_search_path</b>

       Control  where kitty finds the programs to run. The default search order is: First search the system wide
       <b>PATH</b>, then <b><a href="file:~/.local/bin">~/.local/bin</a></b> and <b><a href="file:~/bin">~/bin</a></b>. If still not found, the <b>PATH</b> defined in the login shell after sourcing
       all its startup files is tried. Finally, if present, the <b>PATH</b> specified by the <u>env</u> option is tried.

       This option allows you to prepend, append, or remove paths from this search order. It  can  be  specified
       multiple  times  for  multiple  paths.  A  simple path will be prepended to the search order. A path that
       starts with the <b>+</b> sign will be append to the search order, after <b><a href="file:~/bin">~/bin</a></b> above. A path that starts with the
       <b>-</b> sign will be removed from the entire search order.  For example:

          exe_search_path /some/prepended/path
          exe_search_path +/some/appended/path
          exe_search_path -/some/excluded/path

       <b>update_check_interval</b>

          update_check_interval 24

       The interval to periodically check if an update to kitty is available (in hours). If an update is  found,
       a  system  notification is displayed informing you of the available update. The default is to check every
       24 hours, set to zero to disable. Update checking is only done by  the  official  binary  builds.  Distro
       packages  or source builds do not do update checking. Changing this option by reloading the config is not
       supported.

       <b>startup_session</b>

          startup_session none

       Path to a session file to use for all kitty instances. Can be overridden by  using  the  <u>kitty</u>  <u>--session</u>
       <b>=none</b>  command  line option for individual instances. See <u>Startup</u> <u>Sessions</u> in the kitty documentation for
       details. Note  that  relative  paths  are  interpreted  with  respect  to  the  kitty  config  directory.
       Environment  variables  in  the  path  are  expanded. Changing this option by reloading the config is not
       supported. Note that if kitty is invoked with command line arguments specifying a command  to  run,  this
       option is ignored.

       <b>clipboard_control</b>

          clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary read-clipboard-ask read-primary-ask

       Allow  programs  running  in  kitty  to  read and write from the clipboard. You can control exactly which
       actions  are  allowed.  The  possible  actions  are:  <b>write-clipboard</b>,   <b>read-clipboard</b>,   <b>write-primary</b>,
       <b>read-primary</b>,  <b>read-clipboard-ask</b>, <b>read-primary-ask</b>. The default is to allow writing to the clipboard and
       primary selection and to ask for permission when a program tries to read from the  clipboard.  Note  that
       disabling the read confirmation is a security risk as it means that any program, even the ones running on
       a remote server via SSH can read your clipboard. See also <u>clipboard_max_size</u>.

       <b>clipboard_max_size</b>

          clipboard_max_size 512

       The  maximum  size  (in MB) of data from programs running in kitty that will be stored for writing to the
       system clipboard. A value of zero means no size limit is applied. See also <u>clipboard_control</u>.

       <b>file_transfer_confirmation_bypass</b>

       The password that can be supplied to the <u>file</u> <u>transfer</u> <u>kitten</u> to skip the transfer  confirmation  prompt.
       This  should  only  be  used  when  initiating transfers from trusted computers, over trusted networks or
       encrypted transports, as it allows any programs running on the remote machine to read/write to the  local
       filesystem, without permission.

       <b>allow_hyperlinks</b>

          allow_hyperlinks yes

       Process  <u>hyperlink</u>  escape  sequences  (OSC 8). If disabled OSC 8 escape sequences are ignored. Otherwise
       they become clickable links, that you can click with the mouse or by using the <u>hints</u> <u>kitten</u>.  The special
       value of <b>ask</b> means that kitty will ask before opening the link when clicked.

       <b>shell_integration</b>

          shell_integration enabled

       Enable shell integration on supported shells. This enables features such as jumping to previous  prompts,
       browsing the output of the previous command in a pager, etc. on supported shells. Set to <b>disabled</b> to turn
       off  shell  integration,  completely.  It is also possible to disable individual features, set to a space
       separated list of these values: <b>no-rc</b>, <b>no-cursor</b>, <b>no-title</b>, <b>no-cwd</b>, <b>no-prompt-mark</b>, <b>no-complete</b>, <b>no-sudo</b>.
       See <u>Shell</u> <u>integration</u> for details.

       <b>allow_cloning</b>

          allow_cloning ask

       Control whether programs running in the terminal can request new windows to  be  created.  The  canonical
       example  is  <u>clone-in-kitty</u>.  By  default, kitty will ask for permission for each clone request. Allowing
       cloning unconditionally gives programs running in the terminal (including over SSH) permission to execute
       arbitrary code, as the user who is running the terminal, on the computer that the terminal is running on.

       <b>clone_source_strategies</b>

          clone_source_strategies venv,conda,env_var,path

       Control what shell code is sourced when running <b>clone-in-kitty</b> in the newly cloned window. The  supported
       strategies are:

       <b>venv</b>   Source  the  file  <b>$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate</b>.  This  is  used by the Python stdlib venv module and
              allows cloning venvs automatically.

       <b>conda</b>  Run <b>conda</b> <b>activate</b> <b>$CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV</b>. This supports the virtual environments created by <b>conda</b>.

       <b>env_var</b>
              Execute the contents of the environment variable <u>KITTY_CLONE_SOURCE_CODE</u> with <b>eval</b>.

       <b>path</b>   Source the file pointed to by the environment variable <u>KITTY_CLONE_SOURCE_PATH</u>.

       This option must be a comma separated list of the above values. Only the first valid match, in the  order
       specified, is sourced.

       <b>notify_on_cmd_finish</b>

          notify_on_cmd_finish never

       Show a desktop notification when a long-running command finishes (needs <u>shell_integration</u>).  The possible
       values are:

       <b>never</b>  Never send a notification.

       <b>unfocused</b>
              Only send a notification when the window does not have keyboard focus.

       <b>invisible</b>
              Only  send  a  notification  when  the  window  both is unfocused and not visible to the user, for
              example, because it is in an inactive tab or its OS window is not currently visible (on  platforms
              that support OS window visibility querying this considers an OS Window visible iff it is active).

       <b>always</b> Always send a notification, regardless of window state.

       There are two optional arguments:

       First,  the  minimum  duration  for  what is considered a long running command. The default is 5 seconds.
       Specify a second argument to set the duration. For example: <b>invisible</b> <b>15</b>.   Do  not  set  the  value  too
       small, otherwise a command that launches a new OS Window and exits will spam a notification.

       Second, the action to perform. The default is <b>notify</b>. The possible values are:

       <b>notify</b> Send  a  desktop  notification.  The  subsequent  arguments  are  optional  and  specify  when the
              notification is automatically cleared. The set of possible events when the notification is cleared
              are: <b>focus</b> and <b>next</b>. <b>focus</b> means that when the notification policy is <b>unfocused</b> or  <b>invisible</b>  the
              notification  is automatically cleared when the window regains focus. The value of <b>next</b> means that
              the previous notification is cleared when the next notification is  shown.  The  default  when  no
              arguments are specified is: <b>focus</b> <b>next</b>.

       <b>bell</b>   Ring the terminal bell.

       <b>command</b>
              Run a custom command. All subsequent arguments are the cmdline to run.

       Some more examples:

          # Send a notification when a command takes more than 5 seconds in an unfocused window
          notify_on_cmd_finish unfocused
          # Send a notification when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
          notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0
          # Ring a bell when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
          notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0 bell
          # Run 'notify-send' when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
          # Here %c is replaced by the current command line and %s by the job exit code
          notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0 command notify-send "job finished with status: %s" %c
          # Do not clear previous notification when next command finishes or window regains focus
          notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 5.0 notify

       <b>term</b>

          term xterm-kitty

       The  value  of the <u>TERM</u> environment variable to set. Changing this can break many terminal programs, only
       change it if you know what you are doing, not because you read some advice on "Stack Overflow" to  change
       it.  The <u>TERM</u> variable is used by various programs to get information about the capabilities and behavior
       of the terminal. If you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how different the terminal you
       are changing it to is, various things from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features  may  not
       work. Changing this option by reloading the config will only affect newly created windows.

       <b>terminfo_type</b>

          terminfo_type path

       The  value  of the <u>TERMINFO</u> environment variable to set. This variable is used by programs running in the
       terminal to search for terminfo databases. The default value  of  <b>path</b>  causes  kitty  to  set  it  to  a
       filesystem  location  containing  the  kitty  terminfo  database.  A value of <b>direct</b> means put the entire
       database into the env var directly. This can be useful when connecting to containers, for  example.  But,
       note that not all software supports this. A value of <b>none</b> means do not touch the variable.

       <b>forward_stdio</b>

          forward_stdio no

       Forward  STDOUT  and  STDERR of the kitty process to child processes.  This is useful for debugging as it
       allows  child  processes  to  print  to  kitty's  STDOUT  directly.  For  example,   <b>echo</b>   <b>hello</b>   <b>world</b>
       <b>&gt;&amp;$KITTY_STDIO_FORWARDED</b>   in   a   shell   will   print   to   the   parent  kitty's  STDOUT.  Sets  the
       <b>KITTY_STDIO_FORWARDED=fdnum</b> environment variable so child processes know about the forwarding. Note  that
       on  macOS  this  prevents  the  shell from being run via the login utility so getlogin() will not work in
       programs run in this session.

       <b>menu_map</b>

       Specify entries for various menus in kitty. Currently only the global menubar on macOS is supported.  For
       example:

          menu_map global "Actions::Launch something special" launch --hold --type=os-window sh -c "echo hello world"

       This  will  create a menu entry named "Launch something special" in an "Actions" menu in the macOS global
       menubar.  Sub-menus can be created by adding more levels separated by the <b>::</b> characters.

</pre><h4><b>Os</b> <b>specific</b> <b>tweaks</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wayland_titlebar_color</b>

          wayland_titlebar_color system

       The color of the kitty window's titlebar on Wayland systems with client side window decorations  such  as
       GNOME.  A  value of <b>system</b> means to use the default system colors, a value of <b>background</b> means to use the
       background color of the currently active kitty window and finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as
       <b>#12af59</b> or <b>red</b>.

       <b>macos_titlebar_color</b>

          macos_titlebar_color system

       The color of the kitty window's titlebar on macOS. A value of <b>system</b> means  to  use  the  default  system
       color,  <b>light</b>  or  <b>dark</b>  can  also  be  used to set it explicitly. A value of <b>background</b> means to use the
       background color of the currently active window and finally you can  use  an  arbitrary  color,  such  as
       <b>#12af59</b>  or  <b>red</b>.  WARNING:  This  option  works  by using a hack when arbitrary color (or <b>background</b>) is
       configured, as there is no proper Cocoa API for it. It sets the background color of the entire window and
       makes the titlebar transparent. As such it is incompatible with <u>background_opacity</u>. If you  want  to  use
       both, you are probably better off just hiding the titlebar with <u>hide_window_decorations</u>.

       <b>macos_option_as_alt</b>

          macos_option_as_alt no

       Use  the  <b>Option</b>  key  as  an  <b>Alt</b>  key  on  macOS.  With this set to <b>no</b>, kitty will use the macOS native
       <b>Option</b>+<b>Key</b> to enter Unicode character behavior. This will break any <b>Alt</b>+<b>Key</b> keyboard  shortcuts  in  your
       terminal programs, but you can use the macOS Unicode input technique. You can use the values: <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>
       or  <b>both</b>  to  use only the left, right or both <b>Option</b> keys as <b>Alt</b>, instead. Note that kitty itself always
       treats <b>Option</b> the same as <b>Alt</b>. This means you  cannot  use  this  option  to  configure  different  kitty
       shortcuts  for <b>Option</b>+<b>Key</b> vs. <b>Alt</b>+<b>Key</b>. Also, any kitty shortcuts using <b>Option/Alt</b>+<b>Key</b> will take priority,
       so that any such key presses will not be passed to terminal programs running inside kitty. Changing  this
       option by reloading the config is not supported.

       <b>macos_hide_from_tasks</b>

          macos_hide_from_tasks no

       Hide  the  kitty  window  from  running  tasks  on  macOS  (<b>⌘</b>+<b>Tab</b> and the Dock).  Changing this option by
       reloading the config is not supported.

       <b>macos_quit_when_last_window_closed</b>

          macos_quit_when_last_window_closed no

       Have kitty quit when all the top-level windows are closed on macOS. By default, kitty will stay  running,
       even with no open windows, as is the expected behavior on macOS.

       <b>macos_window_resizable</b>

          macos_window_resizable yes

       Disable this if you want kitty top-level OS windows to not be resizable on macOS.

       <b>macos_thicken_font</b>

          macos_thicken_font 0

       Draw  an extra border around the font with the given width, to increase legibility at small font sizes on
       macOS. For example, a value of <b>0.75</b> will result in rendering that looks similar to sub-pixel antialiasing
       at common font sizes. Note that in modern kitty, this option  is  obsolete  (although  still  supported).
       Consider using <u>text_composition_strategy</u> instead.

       <b>macos_traditional_fullscreen</b>

          macos_traditional_fullscreen no

       Use the macOS traditional full-screen transition, that is faster, but less pretty.

       <b>macos_show_window_title_in</b>

          macos_show_window_title_in all

       Control  where  the  window  title  is  displayed  on macOS. A value of <b>window</b> will show the title of the
       currently active window at the top of the macOS window. A value of <b>menubar</b> will show  the  title  of  the
       currently  active  window  in the macOS global menu bar, making use of otherwise wasted space. A value of
       <b>all</b> will show the title in both places, and <b>none</b> hides the title. See <u>macos_menubar_title_max_length</u>  for
       how to control the length of the title in the menu bar.

       <b>macos_menubar_title_max_length</b>

          macos_menubar_title_max_length 0

       The  maximum number of characters from the window title to show in the macOS global menu bar. Values less
       than one means that there is no maximum limit.

       <b>macos_custom_beam_cursor</b>

          macos_custom_beam_cursor no

       Use a custom mouse cursor for macOS that is easier to see on both light and dark  backgrounds.  Nowadays,
       the  default  macOS  cursor already comes with a white border. WARNING: this might make your mouse cursor
       invisible on dual GPU machines. Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

       <b>macos_colorspace</b>

          macos_colorspace srgb

       The colorspace in which to interpret terminal colors. The default of <b>srgb</b>  will  cause  colors  to  match
       those  seen  in web browsers. The value of <b>default</b> will use whatever the native colorspace of the display
       is.  The value of <b>displayp3</b> will use Apple's special snowflake display P3 color space, which will  result
       in over saturated (brighter) colors with some color shift. Reloading configuration will change this value
       only for newly created OS windows.

       <b>linux_display_server</b>

          linux_display_server auto

       Choose  between Wayland and X11 backends. By default, an appropriate backend based on the system state is
       chosen automatically. Set it to <b>x11</b> or <b>wayland</b> to force the choice. Changing this option by reloading the
       config is not supported.

       <b>wayland_enable_ime</b>

          wayland_enable_ime yes

       Enable Input Method Extension on Wayland. This is  typically  used  for  inputting  text  in  East  Asian
       languages.  However,  its  implementation in Wayland is often buggy and introduces latency into the input
       loop, so disable this if you know you dont need it. Changing this option by reloading the config  is  not
       supported, it will not have any effect.

</pre><h4><b>Keyboard</b> <b>shortcuts</b></h4><pre>
       Keys are identified simply by their lowercase Unicode characters. For example: <b>a</b> for the <b>A</b> key, <b>[</b> for the
       left  square  bracket  key,  etc.  For functional keys, such as <b>Enter</b> or <b>Escape</b>, the names are present at
       <u>Functional</u> <u>key</u> <u>definitions</u>. For modifier keys, the names are <b>ctrl</b> (<b>control</b>,  <b>⌃</b>),  <b>shift</b>  (<b>⇧</b>),  <b>alt</b>  (<b>opt</b>,
       <b>option</b>, <b>⌥</b>), <b>super</b> (<b>cmd</b>, <b>command</b>, <b>⌘</b>).

       Simple  shortcut  mapping  is done with the <b>map</b> directive. For full details on advanced mapping including
       modal and per application maps, see <u>Making</u> <u>your</u> <u>keyboard</u> <u>dance</u>.  Some quick examples to illustrate common
       tasks:

          # unmap a keyboard shortcut, passing it to the program running in kitty
          map kitty_mod+space
          # completely ignore a keyboard event
          map ctrl+alt+f1 discard_event
          # combine multiple actions
          map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout
          # multi-key shortcuts
          map ctrl+x&gt;ctrl+y&gt;z action

       The full list of actions that can be mapped to key presses is available <u>here</u>.

       <b>kitty_mod</b>

          kitty_mod ctrl+shift

       Special modifier key alias for default shortcuts. You can change the value of this option  to  alter  all
       default shortcuts that use <u>kitty_mod</u>.

       <b>clear_all_shortcuts</b>

          clear_all_shortcuts no

       Remove all shortcut definitions up to this point. Useful, for instance, to remove the default shortcuts.

       <b>action_alias</b>

       Has no default values. Example values are shown below:

          action_alias launch_tab launch --type=tab --cwd=current

       Define  action  aliases to avoid repeating the same options in multiple mappings.  Aliases can be defined
       for any action and will be expanded recursively. For example,  the  above  alias  allows  you  to  create
       mappings to launch a new tab in the current working directory without duplication:

          map f1 launch_tab vim
          map f2 launch_tab emacs

       Similarly, to alias kitten invocation:

          action_alias hints kitten hints --hints-offset=0

       <b>kitten_alias</b>

       Has no default values. Example values are shown below:

          kitten_alias hints hints --hints-offset=0

       Like <u>action_alias</u> above, but specifically for kittens. Generally, prefer to use <u>action_alias</u>. This option
       is a legacy version, present for backwards compatibility. It causes all invocations of the aliased kitten
       to  be  substituted.  So  the  example  above  will cause all invocations of the hints kitten to have the
       <u>--hints-offset=0</u> option applied.

   <b>Clipboard</b>
       <b>Copy</b> <b>to</b> <b>clipboard</b>

          map ctrl+shift+c copy_to_clipboard
          map cmd+c copy_to_clipboard 🍎

       There is also a <u>copy_or_interrupt</u> action that can be optionally mapped to <b>Ctrl</b>+<b>C</b>. It will  copy  only  if
       there  is  a  selection and send an interrupt otherwise. Similarly, <u>copy_and_clear_or_interrupt</u> will copy
       and clear the selection or send an interrupt if there is no selection.

       <b>Paste</b> <b>from</b> <b>clipboard</b>

          map ctrl+shift+v paste_from_clipboard
          map cmd+v paste_from_clipboard 🍎

       <b>Paste</b> <b>from</b> <b>selection</b>

          map ctrl+shift+s paste_from_selection
          map shift+insert paste_from_selection

       <b>Pass</b> <b>selection</b> <b>to</b> <b>program</b>

          map ctrl+shift+o pass_selection_to_program

       You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any program with <u>pass_selection_to_program</u>. By
       default, the system's open program is used, but you can specify your own, the selection will be passed as
       a command line argument to the program. For example:

          map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program firefox

       You can pass the current selection to a terminal program running in a new  kitty  window,  by  using  the
       <b>@selection</b> placeholder:

          map kitty_mod+y new_window less @selection

   <b>Scrolling</b>
       <b>Scroll</b> <b>line</b> <b>up</b>

          map opt+cmd+page_down scroll_line_down 🍎
          map cmd+down scroll_line_down 🍎

       <b>Scroll</b> <b>page</b> <b>up</b>

          map ctrl+shift+page_up scroll_page_up
          map cmd+page_up scroll_page_up 🍎

       <b>Scroll</b> <b>page</b> <b>down</b>

          map ctrl+shift+page_down scroll_page_down
          map cmd+page_down scroll_page_down 🍎

       <b>Scroll</b> <b>to</b> <b>top</b>

          map ctrl+shift+home scroll_home
          map cmd+home scroll_home 🍎

       <b>Scroll</b> <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b>

          map ctrl+shift+end scroll_end
          map cmd+end scroll_end 🍎

       <b>Scroll</b> <b>to</b> <b>previous</b> <b>shell</b> <b>prompt</b>

          map ctrl+shift+z scroll_to_prompt -1

       Use  a  parameter of <b>0</b> for <u>scroll_to_prompt</u> to scroll to the last jumped to or the last clicked position.
       Requires <u>shell</u> <u>integration</u> to work.

       <b>Scroll</b> <b>to</b> <b>next</b> <b>shell</b> <b>prompt</b>

          map ctrl+shift+x scroll_to_prompt 1

       <b>Browse</b> <b>scrollback</b> <b>buffer</b> <b>in</b> <b>pager</b>

          map ctrl+shift+h show_scrollback

       You can pipe the contents of the current screen and history buffer as <b>STDIN</b> to an arbitrary program using
       <u>launch</u> <u>--stdin-source</u>.  For example, the following opens the scrollback buffer  in  less  in  an  <u>overlay</u>
       window:

          map f1 launch --stdin-source=@screen_scrollback --stdin-add-formatting --type=overlay less +G -R

       For more details on piping screen and buffer contents to external programs, see <u>The</u> <u>launch</u> <u>command</u>.

       <b>Browse</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>shell</b> <b>command</b> <b>in</b> <b>pager</b>

          map ctrl+shift+g show_last_command_output

       You  can  also  define  additional  shortcuts  to  get the command output.  For example, to get the first
       command output on screen:

          map f1 show_first_command_output_on_screen

       To get the command output that was last accessed by a keyboard action or mouse action:

          map f1 show_last_visited_command_output

       You can pipe the output of the last command run in the shell using the <u>launch</u> action.  For  example,  the
       following opens the output in less in an <u>overlay</u> window:

          map f1 launch --stdin-source=@last_cmd_output --stdin-add-formatting --type=overlay less +G -R

       To get the output of the first command on the screen, use <b>@first_cmd_output_on_screen</b>.  To get the output
       of the last jumped to command, use <b>@last_visited_cmd_output</b>.

       Requires <u>shell</u> <u>integration</u> to work.

   <b>Window</b> <b>management</b>
       <b>New</b> <b>window</b>

          map ctrl+shift+enter new_window
          map cmd+enter new_window 🍎

       You can open a new <u>kitty</u> <u>window</u> running an arbitrary program, for example:

          map kitty_mod+y launch mutt

       You  can open a new window with the current working directory set to the working directory of the current
       window using:

          map ctrl+alt+enter launch --cwd=current

       You can open a new window that is allowed to control kitty via the kitty  remote  control  facility  with
       <u>launch</u>  <u>--allow-remote-control</u>.   Any  programs  running in that window will be allowed to control kitty.
       For example:

          map ctrl+enter launch --allow-remote-control some_program

       You can open a new window next to the currently active window or as the first window, with:

          map ctrl+n launch --location=neighbor
          map ctrl+f launch --location=first

       For more details, see <u>The</u> <u>launch</u> <u>command</u>.

       <b>New</b> <b>OS</b> <b>window</b>

          map ctrl+shift+n new_os_window
          map cmd+n new_os_window 🍎

       Works like <u>new_window</u> above, except that it opens a top-level  <u>OS</u>  <u>window</u>.  In  particular  you  can  use
       <u>new_os_window_with_cwd</u> to open a window with the current working directory.

       <b>Close</b> <b>window</b>

          map ctrl+shift+w close_window

       <b>Visually</b> <b>select</b> <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> <b>window</b>

          map ctrl+shift+f7 focus_visible_window

       Display  overlay  numbers  and alphabets on the window, and switch the focus to the window when you press
       the key. When there are only two windows, the focus will be  switched  directly  without  displaying  the
       overlay.    You    can    change    the    overlay    characters    and    their    order   with   option
       <u>visual_window_select_characters</u>.

       <b>Visually</b> <b>swap</b> <b>window</b> <b>with</b> <b>another</b>

          map ctrl+shift+f8 swap_with_window

       Works like <u>focus_visible_window</u> above, but swaps the window.

   <b>Tab</b> <b>management</b>
       <b>Next</b> <b>tab</b>

          map ctrl+shift+alt+t set_tab_title
          map shift+cmd+i set_tab_title 🍎

       You can also create shortcuts to go to specific <u>tabs</u>, with <b>1</b> being the first tab, <b>2</b> the second tab and <b>-1</b>
       being the previously active tab, <b>-2</b> being the tab active before the previously active tab and so on.  Any
       number larger than the number of tabs goes to the last tab  and  any  number  less  than  the  number  of
       previously used tabs in the history goes to the oldest previously used tab in the history:

          map ctrl+alt+1 goto_tab 1
          map ctrl+alt+2 goto_tab 2

       Just as with <u>new_window</u> above, you can also pass the name of arbitrary commands to run when using <u>new_tab</u>
       and <u>new_tab_with_cwd</u>. Finally, if you want the new tab to open next to the current tab rather than at the
       end of the tabs list, use:

          map ctrl+t new_tab !neighbor [optional cmd to run]

   <b>Layout</b> <b>management</b>
       <b>Next</b> <b>layout</b>

          map ctrl+shift+l next_layout

       You can also create shortcuts to switch to specific <u>layouts</u>:

          map ctrl+alt+t goto_layout tall
          map ctrl+alt+s goto_layout stack

       Similarly, to switch back to the previous layout:

          map ctrl+alt+p last_used_layout

       There  is also a <u>toggle_layout</u> action that switches to the named layout or back to the previous layout if
       in the named layout. Useful to temporarily "zoom" the active window by switching to the stack layout:

          map ctrl+alt+z toggle_layout stack

   <b>Font</b> <b>sizes</b>
       You can change the font size for all top-level kitty OS windows at a time or only the current one.

       <b>Increase</b> <b>font</b> <b>size</b>

          map ctrl+shift+equal change_font_size all +2.0
          map ctrl+shift+plus change_font_size all +2.0
          map ctrl+shift+kp_add change_font_size all +2.0
          map cmd+plus change_font_size all +2.0 🍎
          map cmd+equal change_font_size all +2.0 🍎
          map shift+cmd+equal change_font_size all +2.0 🍎

       <b>Decrease</b> <b>font</b> <b>size</b>

          map ctrl+shift+minus change_font_size all -2.0
          map ctrl+shift+kp_subtract change_font_size all -2.0
          map cmd+minus change_font_size all -2.0 🍎
          map shift+cmd+minus change_font_size all -2.0 🍎

       <b>Reset</b> <b>font</b> <b>size</b>

          map ctrl+shift+backspace change_font_size all 0
          map cmd+0 change_font_size all 0 🍎

       To setup shortcuts for specific font sizes:

          map kitty_mod+f6 change_font_size all 10.0

       To setup shortcuts to change only the current OS window's font size:

          map kitty_mod+f6 change_font_size current 10.0

   <b>Select</b> <b>and</b> <b>act</b> <b>on</b> <b>visible</b> <b>text</b>

       terminal or copy it to the clipboard.

       <b>Open</b> <b>URL</b>

          map ctrl+shift+e open_url_with_hints

       Open  a  currently  visible  URL  using  the  keyboard.  The program used to open the URL is specified in
       <u>open_url_with</u>.

       <b>Insert</b> <b>selected</b> <b>path</b>

          map ctrl+shift+p&gt;f kitten hints --type path --program -

       Select a path/filename and insert it into the terminal. Useful, for instance to run  <b>git</b>  commands  on  a
       filename output from a previous <b>git</b> command.

       <b>Open</b> <b>selected</b> <b>path</b>

          map ctrl+shift+p&gt;shift+f kitten hints --type path

       Select a path/filename and open it with the default open program.

       <b>Insert</b> <b>selected</b> <b>line</b>

          map ctrl+shift+p&gt;l kitten hints --type line --program -

       Select a line of text and insert it into the terminal. Useful for the output of things like: <b>ls</b> <b>-1</b>.

       <b>Insert</b> <b>selected</b> <b>word</b>

          map ctrl+shift+p&gt;w kitten hints --type word --program -

       Select words and insert into terminal.

       <b>Insert</b> <b>selected</b> <b>hash</b>

          map ctrl+shift+p&gt;h kitten hints --type hash --program -

       Select something that looks like a hash and insert it into the terminal. Useful with <b>git</b>, which uses SHA1
       hashes to identify commits.

       <b>Open</b> <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> <b>file</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> <b>line</b>

          map ctrl+shift+p&gt;n kitten hints --type linenum

       Select  something  that  looks  like <b>filename:linenum</b> and open it in your default editor at the specified
       line number.

       <b>Open</b> <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> <b>hyperlink</b>

          map ctrl+shift+p&gt;y kitten hints --type hyperlink

       Select a <u>hyperlink</u> (i.e. a URL that has been marked as such by the terminal program, for example,  by  <b>ls</b>
       <b>--hyperlink=auto</b>).

       The  hints  kitten  has  many more modes of operation that you can map to different shortcuts. For a full

       <b>Open</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitty</b> <b>command</b> <b>shell</b>

          map ctrl+shift+escape kitty_shell window

       Open the kitty shell in a new <b>window</b> / <b>tab</b> / <b>overlay</b> / <b>os_window</b> to control kitty using commands.

       <b>Increase</b> <b>background</b> <b>opacity</b>

          map ctrl+shift+a&gt;m set_background_opacity +0.1

       <b>Decrease</b> <b>background</b> <b>opacity</b>

          map ctrl+shift+a&gt;l set_background_opacity -0.1

          map ctrl+shift+delete clear_terminal reset active
          map opt+cmd+r clear_terminal reset active 🍎

       You can create shortcuts to clear/reset the terminal. For example:

          # Reset the terminal
          map f1 clear_terminal reset active
          # Clear the terminal screen by erasing all contents
          map f1 clear_terminal clear active
          # Clear the terminal scrollback by erasing it
          map f1 clear_terminal scrollback active
          # Scroll the contents of the screen into the scrollback
          map f1 clear_terminal scroll active
          # Clear everything on screen up to the line with the cursor or the start of the current prompt (needs shell integration)
          map f1 clear_terminal to_cursor active
          # Same as above except cleared lines are moved into scrollback
          map f1 clear_terminal to_cursor_scroll active

       If you want to operate on all kitty windows instead of just the current one, use all instead of active.

       Some useful functions that can be defined in the shell rc files to perform various kinds of  clearing  of
       the current window:

          clear-only-screen() {
              printf "\e[H\e[2J"
          }

          clear-screen-and-scrollback() {
              printf "\e[H\e[3J"
          }

          clear-screen-saving-contents-in-scrollback() {
              printf "\e[H\e[22J"
          }

       For  instance, using these escape codes, it is possible to remap <b>Ctrl</b>+<b>L</b> to both scroll the current screen
       contents into the scrollback buffer and clear the screen, instead of just clearing the screen.  For  ZSH,
       in <b><a href="file:~/.zshrc">~/.zshrc</a></b>, add:

          ctrl_l() {
              builtin print -rn -- $'\r\e[0J\e[H\e[22J' &gt;"$TTY"
              builtin zle .reset-prompt
              builtin zle -R
          }
          zle -N ctrl_l
          bindkey '^l' ctrl_l

       Alternatively,  you  can  just  add <b>map</b> <b>ctrl+l</b> <b>clear_terminal</b> <b>to_cursor_scroll</b> <b>active</b> to <b>kitty.conf</b> which
       works with no changes to the shell rc files, but only clears up to the prompt, it does not clear any text
       at the prompt itself.

       <b>Clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b>

          map cmd+k clear_terminal to_cursor active 🍎

       <b>Clear</b> <b>scrollback</b>

          map option+cmd+k clear_terminal scrollback active 🍎

       <b>Clear</b> <b>screen</b>

          map cmd+ctrl+l clear_terminal to_cursor_scroll active 🍎

       <b>Reload</b> <b>kitty.conf</b>

          map ctrl+shift+f5 load_config_file
          map ctrl+cmd+, load_config_file 🍎

       Reload <b>kitty.conf</b>, applying any changes since the last time it was loaded. Note that a handful of options
       cannot be dynamically changed and require a full restart of kitty. Particularly, when changing  shortcuts
       for actions located on the macOS global menu bar, a full restart is needed. You can also map a keybinding
       to load a different config file, for example:

          map f5 load_config /path/to/alternative/kitty.conf

       Note  that  all  options from the original <b>kitty.conf</b> are discarded, in other words the new configuration
       <u>replace</u> the old ones.

       <b>Debug</b> <b>kitty</b> <b>configuration</b>

          map ctrl+shift+f6 debug_config
          map opt+cmd+, debug_config 🍎

       Show details about exactly what configuration kitty is running with and its host environment. Useful  for
       debugging issues.

       <b>Send</b> <b>arbitrary</b> <b>text</b> <b>on</b> <b>key</b> <b>presses</b>

       You  can  tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to the client program when pressing specified
       shortcut keys. For example:

          map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text

       This will send "Special text" when you press the <b>Ctrl</b>+<b>Alt</b>+<b>A</b> key combination. The text to be sent  decodes
       <u>ANSI</u>  <u>C</u> <u>escapes</u> so you can use escapes like <b>\e</b> to send control codes or <b>\u21fb</b> to send Unicode characters
       (or you can just input the Unicode characters directly as UTF-8 text). You can use <b>kitten</b> <b>show-key</b> to get
       the key escape codes you want to emulate.

       The first argument to <b>send_text</b> is the keyboard modes in which to activate  the  shortcut.  The  possible
       values  are  <b>normal</b>,  <b>application</b>,  <b>kitty</b> or a comma separated combination of them.  The modes <b>normal</b> and
       <b>application</b> refer to the DECCKM cursor key mode for terminals, and <b>kitty</b> refers  to  the  kitty  extended
       keyboard protocol. The special value <b>all</b> means all of them.

       Some more examples:

          # Output a word and move the cursor to the start of the line (like typing and pressing Home)
          map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\e[H
          map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\eOH
          # Run a command at a shell prompt (like typing the command and pressing Enter)
          map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal,application some command with arguments\r
