</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-umax_pp - SANE backend for Umax Astra parallel port flatbed scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>sane-umax_pp</b> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to Umax
       parallel port flatbed scanners.  The following scanners work with this backend:

              Model:
              --------------------
              Astra 610P
              Astra 1220P
              HP3200C
              Astra 1600P
              Astra 2000P
              Genius ColorPage-Life Pro

       This  backend  handles  75x75,  150x150,  300x300,  600x600  and  600x1200 for 1220P/1600P/2000P dpi scan
       resolutions, and 75x75, 150x150, 300x300 and 300x600 for 610P. In color  and  gray  levels,  there  is  a
       software lineart mode.

       The  new  generation  models share a newer version of the 610P ASIC embedded in an EPAT chip.  Only parts
       such as CCD and ADC change from one to another.  They  even  all  reports  being  UMAX  Astra  1220P  via
       IEEE1284.   There  isn't a software method to recognize them properly. Under windows, model is set by the
       driver installed, regardless of the hardware.

       <b>EPP/ECP</b> <b>MODES</b> <b>ONLY</b>
              The current version of the backend uses only EPP or ECP mode to communicate with the scanner. PS/2
              mode isn't implemented. The 610P only use SPP. It is recommended that you set your  parallel  port
              to  EPP  in BIOS with the current version of this backend. You can leave it to ECP or ECP+EPP, but
              in this case you may not use ppdev but only direct hardware access if you have to use ECP.  ECPEPP
              will only work if you use a 2.4 or 2.6 kernel with ppdev character device support.

       This backend does support parport sharing only <u>if</u> <u>you</u> <u>have</u> <u>a</u> <u>kernel</u> <u>with</u> <u>ppdev</u> <u>support.</u>

       Note that if you don't use the ppdev character device, the backend needs to run as root.  To  allow  user
       access  to  the  scanner run the backend through the network interface (see <b><a href="../man8/saned.8.html">saned</a></b>(8) and <b><a href="../man5/sane-net.5.html">sane-net</a></b>(5)).  A
       more relaxed solution (security wise) is to add suid bit to the frontend  (see  <b><a href="../man1/chmod.1.html">chmod</a></b>(1)).   The  backend
       drops  root  privileges  as  soon as it can, right after gaining direct access to I/O ports, which lessen
       risks of being root.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              <u>port</u> <u>value</u>

       Where <b>value</b> is:

              auto   autodetect all parallel ports and probe them for scanner

              safe-auto
                     autodetect all parallel ports and probe them for scanner, but does not try direct  hardware
                     access

              <u>/dev/ppi0</u>
                     uses  *BSD  ppi device, depending on the number of available parallel port, you have to use
                     <u>/dev/ppi1</u>, <u>/dev/ppi2</u>, ...

              <u>/dev/parport0</u>
                     uses Linux ppdev device, depending on the number of available parallel port,  you  have  to
                     use <u>/dev/parport1</u>, <u>/dev/parport2</u>, ...

              0x378  does direct hardware access on the given address. Usual values are 0x378, 0x278, 0x3BC.  In
                     this case, you have to run the backend as root (*BSD and Linux), or with 'IOPL=yes' on OS/2

       <b>NOTE:</b>  in  all  cases, you must have sufficient privileges to get access to the chosen device or address.
       Depending on the security settings, devices may not be available for  all  users.   You  have  to  change
       permissions on the <u>/dev/ppi*</u> or <u>/dev/parport*</u> devices.

       You can rename any device using the

              <u>name</u> <u>devname</u>
              <u>model</u> <u>model</u>
              <u>vendor</u> <u>vendor</u>

       options. These options apply to the last port option.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Please make sure to edit <u>umax_pp.conf</u> <b>before</b> you use the backend.

       The  contents  of  the  <u>umax_pp.conf</u>  file  is a list of options and device names that correspond to Umax
       scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.

       The eight options supported are <b>red-gain</b>, <b>green-gain</b>, <b>blue-gain</b>, <b>red-offset</b>,  <b>green-offset</b>,  <b>blue-offset</b>,
       <b>astra</b>, and <b>buffer</b>.

       Options  <b>red-gain</b>,  <b>green-gain</b>  and <b>blue-gain</b> allow you to adjust the sensitivity of your scanner for the
       given color. Values range from 0 (lowest gain) to 15 (highest).  If  the  advanced  option  "Gain"  isn't
       checked  in  the  frontend,  the  backend  does  automatic gain calibration, and do not use user provided
       values.

       Options <b>red-offset</b>, <b>green-offset</b> and <b>blue-offset</b> allow you to adjust the offset of your scanner  for  the
       given color. Values range from 0 (lowest offset) to 15 (highest).

       Option  <b>astra</b>  allows  you  to  change the model of your scanner. Current auto detection is based on side
       effects on scanning when using 1220P command set on other models, so it  may  fail  on  unknown  hardware
       combination.  Valid  values  are  610, 1220, 1600 and 2000. It is useful only when autodetection fails to
       detect properly your scanner model. If your scanner work properly but is reported wrongly, let it be that
       way.  The only valid case to change the model is when your scanner produces "black" or "inverted"  scans.
       In this case you can put the model. Be aware that it will prevent scanner model autodetection.

       Option  <b>buffer</b> allows you to change the size of the scan buffer. The size must be specified in bytes. The
       default value is 2 megabytes. Decreasing this value will improve the smoothness of progress  bar  in  the
       frontend, but will stall the scan more often.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/umax_pp.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file (see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-umax_pp.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-umax_pp.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of directories that may contain the configuration
              file.  On *NIX systems, the directories are separated by a  colon  (`:'),  under  OS/2,  they  are
              separated  by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file is searched
              in two default directories: first, the current working directory (".") and  then  in  <u>/etc/sane.d</u>.
              If  the  value  of  the environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then the
              default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being
              searched (in this order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_UMAX_PP</b>
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug  level  for  this  backend.   E.g.,  a value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

              level   debug output
              ------- ------------------------------
               0       nothing
               1       errors
               2       warnings &amp; minor errors
               3       additional information
               4       debug information
               5       code flow (not supported yet)
               6       special debug information

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_UMAX_PP_LOW</b>
              This variable sets the debug level for the SANE interface for the Umax ASIC.  Note  that  enabling
              this will spam your terminal with some million lines of debug output.

              level   debug output
              ------- -------------------------------
               0       nothing
               1       errors
               8       command blocks
               16      detailed code flow
               32      dump datafiles
               255     everything

</pre><h4><b>BUG</b> <b>REPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       If  something  doesn't work, please contact me. But I need some information about your scanner to be able
       to help you...

       <u>SANE</u> <u>version</u>
              Run <u>scanimage</u> <u>-V</u> to determine this

       <u>the</u> <u>backend</u> <u>version</u> <u>and</u> <u>your</u> <u>scanner</u> <u>hardware</u>
              Run <u>SANE_DEBUG_UMAX_PP=255</u> <u>scanimage</u> <u>-L</u> <u>2&gt;log</u> as root. If  you  don't  get  any  output  from  the
              <b>sane-umax_pp</b>  backend, make sure a line "umax_pp" is included into your <u>/etc/sane.d/dll.conf</u> file.
              If your scanner isn't detected, make sure you've defined the right port address,  or  the  correct
              device in your <u>umax_pp.conf</u> file.

       <u>the</u> <u>name</u> <u>of</u> <u>your</u> <u>scanner/vendor</u>
              also  a  worthy  information.  Please  also  include  the optical resolution and lamp type of your
              scanner, both can be found in the manual of your scanner.

       <u>any</u> <u>further</u> <u>comments</u>
              if you have comments about the documentation (what could be done better), or you  think  I  should
              know something, please include it.
