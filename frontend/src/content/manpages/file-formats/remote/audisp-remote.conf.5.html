       audisp-remote.conf - the audisp-remote configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>audisp-remote.conf</b> is the file that controls the configuration of the audit remote logging subsystem. The
       options that are available are as follows:

       <u>remote_server</u>
              This is a one word character string that is the remote server hostname or address that this plugin
              will send log information to. This can be the numeric address or a resolvable hostname.

       <u>port</u>   This option is an unsigned integer that indicates what port to connect to on the remote machine.

       <u>local_port</u>
              This  option  is  an  unsigned integer that indicates what local port to connect from on the local
              machine.  If unspecified (the default) or set to the word <u>any</u> then any available unprivileged port
              is used. This is a security mechanism to prevent untrusted user space apps from  injecting  events
              into  the  audit daemon. You should set it to an unused port &lt; 1024 to ensure that only privileged
              users can bind to that port. Then also set the tcp_client_ports  in  the  aggregating  auditd.conf
              file to match the ports that clients are sending from.

       <u>transport</u>
              This  parameter  tells  the  remote logging app how to send events to the remote system. The valid
              options are <u>TCP</u>, and <u>KRB5</u>.  If set to <u>TCP</u>, the remote logging app will just make  a  normal  clear
              text  connection  to  the  remote  system.  If  its  set to <u>KRB5</u>, then Kerberos 5 will be used for
              authentication and encryption. The default value is TCP.

       <u>mode</u>   This parameter tells the remote logging app what strategy to use getting  records  to  the  remote
              system.  Valid  values  are  <u>immediate</u>, and <u>forward</u> .  If set to <u>immediate</u>, the remote logging app
              will attempt to send events immediately after getting them.  <u>forward</u> means that it will store  the
              events  to  disk  and  then attempt to send the records. If the connection cannot be made, it will
              queue records until it can connect to the remote system. The depth of the queue is  controlled  by
              the <u>queue_depth</u> option.

       <u>queue_file</u>
              Path  of  a  file  used  for  the  event  queue  if  <u>mode</u>  is  set  to  <u>forward</u>.   The  default is
              <b>/var/spool/audit/remote.log</b>.

       <u>queue_depth</u>
              This option is an unsigned integer that determines how many records can be buffered to disk or  in
              memory  before  considering it to be a failure sending. This parameter affects the <u>forward</u> mode of
              the <u>mode</u> option and internal queueing for temporary network outages. The default depth is 2048.

       <u>format</u> This parameter tells the remote logging app what data format will be used for  the  messages  sent
              over  the  network.   The  default  is  <u>managed</u> which adds some overhead to ensure each message is
              properly handled on the remote end, and to receive status messages from  the  remote  server.   If
              <u>ascii</u>  is  given  instead,  each  message is a simple ASCII text line with no overhead at all. The
              <u>ascii</u> format is a very simplistic protocol. If there are  any  network  problems,  it  will  cause
              audisp-remote to exit. Auditd may or may not restart it on next event. If something more robust is
              needed, use the <u>managed</u> format. If <u>mode</u> is set to <u>forward</u>, <u>format</u> must be <u>managed</u>.

       <u>network_retry_time</u>
              The  time,  in  seconds,  between  retries when a network error is detected.  Note that this pause
              applies starting after the second attempt, so as to  avoid  unneeded  delays  if  a  reconnect  is
              sufficient to fix the problem.  The default is 1 second.

       <u>max_tries_per_record</u>
              The maximum number of times an attempt is made to deliver each message.  The minimum value is one,
              as  even  a  completely  successful  delivery requires at least one try.  If too many attempts are
              made, the network_failure_action action is performed.  The default is 3.

       <u>max_time_per_record</u>
              The maximum amount of time, in seconds, spent attempting to deliver each message.  Note that  both
              this  and  <u>max_tries_per_record</u>  should be set, as each try may take a long time to time out.  The
              default value is 5 seconds.  If too much time is used on  a  message,  the  network_failure_action
              action is performed.

       <u>heartbeat_timeout</u>
              This  parameter  determines  how  often in seconds the client should send a heartbeat event to the
              remote server. This is used to let both the client and server know that each end is alive and  has
              not  terminated  in  a  way  that it did not shutdown the connection uncleanly. This value must be
              coordinated with the server's <u>tcp_client_max_idle</u> setting. The default value is 0  which  disables
              sending a heartbeat.

       <u>network_failure_action</u>
              This  parameter  tells  the  system  what  action to take whenever there is an error detected when
              sending audit events to the remote system. Valid  values  are  <u>ignore</u>,  <u>syslog</u>,  <u>exec</u>,  <u>warn_once</u>,
              <u>suspend</u>,  <u>single</u>,  <u>halt</u>,  and  <u>stop</u>.  If set to <u>ignore</u>, the remote logging app does nothing. If an
              event was sent, its dequeued.  <u>Syslog</u> means that it will issue a warning to syslog.  If  an  event
              was  sent,  its  dequeued. This is the default.  <u>exec</u> /path-to-script will execute the script. You
              cannot pass parameters to the script. If an event was sent, its dequeued.   <u>warn_once_continue</u>  is
              like  syslog  except  that  only  one  message  is  put  in  syslog until an event is successfully
              transferred.  <u>warn_once</u> is like warn_once_continue except that the event is not dequeued.  <u>Suspend</u>
              will cause the remote logging app to stop sending records to the remote system.  The  logging  app
              will  still  be  alive. If an event was sent, it is not dequeued. The <u>single</u> option will cause the
              remote logging app to put the computer system in single user mode. If an event was sent, it is not
              dequeued. The <u>stop</u> option will cause the remote logging app  to  exit,  but  leave  other  plugins
              running.  If  an event was sent, it is not dequeued. The <u>halt</u> option will cause the remote logging
              app to shutdown the computer system. If an event was sent, it is not dequeued. The default  is  to
              stop.

       <u>disk_low_action</u>
              Likewise, this parameter tells the system what action to take if the remote end signals a disk low
              error.  The default is ignore.

       <u>disk_full_action</u>
              Likewise,  this  parameter  tells  the system what action to take if the remote end signals a disk
              full error.  The default is warn_once.

       <u>disk_error_action</u>
              Likewise, this parameter tells the system what action to take if the remote  end  signals  a  disk
              error.  The default is warn_once.

       <u>remote_ending_action</u>
              Likewise,  this  parameter tells the system what action to take if the network connection is lost.
              This action has one additional option, <u>reconnect</u> which tells  the  remote  plugin  to  attempt  to
              reconnect  to  the  server  upon receipt of the next audit record. If an event was being sent when
              something triggered this action, it is not dequeued. If it is unsuccessful  in  reconnecting,  the
              audit record could be lost. The default is to reconnect.

       <u>generic_error_action</u>
              Likewise,  this  parameter tells the system what action to take if the remote end signals an error
              we don't recognize.  The default is to log it to syslog.

       <u>generic_warning_action</u>
              Likewise, this parameter tells the system what action to take if the remote end signals a  warning
              we don't recognize.  The default is to log it to syslog.

       <u>queue_error_action</u>
              Likewise, this parameter tells the system what action to take if there is a problem working with a
              local record queue.  The default is stop.

       <u>overflow_action</u>
              This  parameter  tells the system what action to take if the internal event queue overflows. Valid
              values are <u>ignore</u>, <u>syslog</u>, <u>suspend</u>, <u>single</u>, and <u>halt</u> .  If set to <u>ignore</u>, the remote  logging  app
              does nothing.  <u>Syslog</u> means that it will issue a warning to syslog.  This is the default.  <u>Suspend</u>
              will  cause  the  remote logging app to stop sending records to the remote system. The logging app
              will still be alive. The <u>single</u> option will cause the remote  logging  app  to  put  the  computer
              system  in  single  user  mode.  The <u>halt</u> option will cause the remote logging app to shutdown the
              computer system.

       <u>startup_failure_action</u>
              This parameter tells the system what action to take whenever there is an error connecting  to  the
              remote  system  during  startup.  Typically, this is benign as the plugin's default behavior is to
              attempt reconnecting until it succeeds. But there may be times  when  you  want  to  do  something
              different.  Valid  values are <u>ignore</u>, <u>syslog</u>, <u>exec</u>, <u>warn_once</u>, and <u>warn_once_continue</u> .  If set to
              <u>ignore</u>, the remote logging app does nothing.  <u>Syslog</u> means that it will issue a warning to syslog.
              <u>exec</u> /path-to-script will execute the script. You cannot pass parameters to the script.  <u>warn_once</u>
              is like syslog except that only one message is put  in  syslog  until  an  event  is  successfully
              transferred.   <u>warn_once_continue</u>  is  like  warn_once  except it ignores the problem. This is the
              default.

       <u>enable_krb5</u>
              This option is deprecated. Use the <u>transport</u> option to enable Kerberos  support.  If  this  option
              follows  the transport configuration option, it will override the transport setting. This would be
              the normal expected behavior for backwards compatibility. If set to <u>yes</u>, Kerberos 5 will  be  used
              for  authentication  and  encryption.   Default is <u>no</u>.  Note that encryption can only be used with
              managed connections, not plain ASCII.

       <u>krb5_principal</u>
              If specified, This is the expected principal for the server.  The client and server will  use  the
              specified  principal  to  negotiate  the  encryption.   The  format for the <u>krb5_principal</u> is like
              somename/hostname,  see  the  auditd.conf  man  page  for  details.    If   not   specified,   the
              krb5_client_name and remote_server values are used.

       <u>krb5_client_name</u>
              This  specifies  the  name  portion of the client's own principal.  If unspecified, the default is
              "auditd".  The remainder of the principal will consist of the host's fully qualified  domain  name
              and  the  default  Kerberos  realm, like this: <u>auditd/<a href="mailto:host14.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM">host14.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM</a></u> (assuming you
              gave "auditd" as the krb_client_name).  Note that  the  client  and  server  must  have  the  same
              principal name and realm.

       <u>krb5_key_file</u>
              Location of the key for this client's principal.  Note that the key file must be owned by root and
              mode 0400.  The default is <u>/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.key</u>

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Specifying  a  local  port  may  make  it  difficult  to  restart the audit subsystem due to the previous
       connection being in a TIME_WAIT state, if you're reconnecting to and from the same  hosts  and  ports  as
       before.

       The  network  failure  logic works as follows: The first attempt to deliver normally "just works".  If it
       doesn't, a second attempt is immediately made, perhaps after reconnecting to the server.  If  the  second
       attempt also fails, <u>audispd-remote</u> pauses for the configured time and tries again.  It continues to pause
       and  retry  until  either  too many attempts have been made or the allowed time expires.  Note that these
       times govern the maximum amount of time the remote server is allowed in order to reboot, if you  want  to
       maintain logging across a reboot.

       It  is  recommended  to  set a large q_depth in auditd.conf if using this plugin. Also set an even bigger
       q_depth in audisp-remote.conf. Also set the heartbeat_timeout to something  non-zero  but  coordinate  it
       with  the server so that it's half the size of the server's tcp_client_max_idle setting. This is required
       to get retries in a reasonable time if the network has a problem.
