</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       router.db - rancid group configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>router.db</b>  contains information for devices which are members of a rancid group.  <u><a href="../man1/control_rancid.1.html">control_rancid</a></u>(1) reads
       this file to compile a list of devices which it should collect.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       One device is listed per-line, where the syntax is:

                 &lt;device_name&gt;;&lt;device_type&gt;;&lt;state&gt;[;comments]

       For example:
                 scooby.shrubbery.net;cisco;up

       The fields are as follows:

       <b>&lt;device_name&gt;</b>
              The name of the device, which must resolve via <u>gethostbyname</u>, used as the argument  to  <u><a href="../man1/telnet.1.html">telnet</a></u>(1),
              <u><a href="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh</a></u>(1),  or <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1), to connect to the device.  Once converted to lower-case, this also becomes the
              name of the file used to store the configuration under <u>$BASEDIR/&lt;group&gt;/configs</u>.

              Experience has shown that using the device's FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) works best, as  in
              the example above.

       <b>&lt;device_type&gt;</b>
              The type of device from the set:

               <b>agm</b>    A  Cisco  Anomaly  Guard  Module  (aka Riverhead).  Suspect that at some point the UI will
                      become more cisco-like and it can be merged with the IOS rancid module.

       <b>&lt;state&gt;</b>
              The state is either "up", or some other arbitrary value, e.g. "down".  If the device is not marked
              "up" the device's configuration will not be collected.  It is highly recommended that comments are
              made for any router not listed as up, so as to indicate the reason a router is not to  be  polled,
              e.g.:

              dial1.paris;cisco;up;
              core1.paris;cisco;down;in testing until 5/5/2001.
              core2.paris;cisco;ticketed;Ticket 6054234, 5/3/2001
              border1.paris;juniper;up;

              The  script "downreport" in util/ can be used to produce a report of routers in router.db that are
              not marked "up".

       <b>[comments]</b>
              Freeform string to describe the current state of the router.

       A ``#'' at the beginning of a line is a comment; the entire line is ignored.

       If a device is deleted from the <b>router.db</b> file, then <b>rancid</b> will clean up by removing the device's config
       file from <u>$BASEDIR/&lt;group&gt;/configs</u>.  The device will be removed from the revision control system.  It  is
       possible, in most cases, to resurrect or check-out copies of deleted device configurations.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$BASEDIR/&lt;group&gt;/router.db</b>
              Configuration  file  described  here, where &lt;group&gt; is a device group name defined in the variable
              <u>LIST_OF_GROUPS</u> within <u>$BASEDIR/etc/rancid.conf</u>.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       In RANCID releases prior to 3.0, <b>router.db</b> used colons (:) as its field separator.  This was  changed  to
       allow IPv6 addresses to be used in router.db.
