       net - format of .net files read/written by Magic's netlist editor

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Netlist  files  are  read and written by Magic's netlist editor in a very simple ASCII format.  The first
       line contains the characters ``  Netlist File'' (the leading blank is important).   After  that  comes  a
       blank  line  and  then  the descriptions of one or more nets.  Each net contains one or more lines, where
       each line contains a single terminal name.  The nets are separated by blank  lines.   Any  line  that  is
       blank or whose first character is blank is considered to be a separator line and the rest of its contents
       are ignored.

       Each  terminal  name  is  a  path, much like a file path name in Unix.  It consists of one or more fields
       separated by slashes.  The last field in the path is the name of a label in a cell.  The other fields (if
       any), are cell instance identifiers that form a path from the edit cell down to  the  label.   The  first
       instance  identifier must name a subcell of the edit cell, the second must be a subcell of the first, and
       so on.

       Instance identifiers are unique within their parent cells, so a terminal path selects a  unique  cell  to
       contain the label.  However, the same label may appear multiple times within its cell.  When this occurs,
       Magic  assumes  that  the identical labels identify electrically equivalent terminals; it will choose the
       closest of them when routing to that terminal.  Further, after connecting to one of these terminals Magic
       may take advantage of the internal wiring connecting them together and route through a cell  to  complete
       the net's wiring.

       An example netlist file follows below.  It contains three distinct nets.

              regcell[21,2]/output
              latch[2]/input
               This line starts with a blank, so it's a separator.
