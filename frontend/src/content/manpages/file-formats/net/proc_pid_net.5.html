       /proc/pid/net/, <a href="file:/proc/net/">/proc/net/</a> - network layer information

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/net/</u> (since Linux 2.6.25)
              See the description of <u><a href="file:/proc/net">/proc/net</a></u>.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/net/">/proc/net/</a></u>
              This  directory  contains  various  files  and  subdirectories  containing  information  about the
              networking layer.  The files contain ASCII structures and are, therefore,  readable  with  <b><a href="../man1/cat.1.html">cat</a></b>(1).
              However, the standard <b><a href="../man8/netstat.8.html">netstat</a></b>(8) suite provides much cleaner access to these files.

              With  the  advent  of  network  namespaces,  various  information relating to the network stack is
              virtualized (see <b><a href="../man7/network_namespaces.7.html">network_namespaces</a></b>(7)).  Thus, since Linux 2.6.25, <u><a href="file:/proc/net">/proc/net</a></u> is a  symbolic  link
              to  the  directory  <u><a href="file:/proc/self/net">/proc/self/net</a></u>, which contains the same files and directories as listed below.
              However, these files and directories now expose information for the network namespace of which the
              process is a member.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/net/arp">/proc/net/arp</a></u>
              This holds an ASCII readable dump of the kernel ARP table used for address resolutions.   It  will
              show both dynamically learned and preprogrammed ARP entries.  The format is:

                  IP address     HW type   Flags     HW address          Mask   Device
                  192.168.0.50   0x1       0x2       00:50:BF:25:68:F3   *      eth0
                  192.168.0.250  0x1       0xc       00:00:00:00:00:00   *      eth0

              Here "IP address" is the IPv4 address of the machine and the "HW type" is the hardware type of the
              address  from  RFC 826.   The  flags  are  the  internal flags of the ARP structure (as defined in
              <u><a href="file:/usr/include/linux/if_arp.h">/usr/include/linux/if_arp.h</a></u>) and the "HW address" is the data  link  layer  mapping  for  that  IP
              address if it is known.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/net/dev">/proc/net/dev</a></u>
              The dev pseudo-file contains network device status information.  This gives the number of received
              and  sent packets, the number of errors and collisions and other basic statistics.  These are used
              by the <b><a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a></b>(8) program to report device status.  The format is:

              Inter-|   Receive                                                |  Transmit

              Internet Group Management Protocol.  Defined in <u>/usr/src/linux/net/core/igmp.c</u>.

       <u>/proc/net/rarp</u>
              This file uses the same format as the <u>arp</u> file and contains the current reverse  mapping  database
              used  to  provide  <b><a href="../man8/rarp.8.html">rarp</a></b>(8)  reverse  address  lookup services.  If RARP is not configured into the
              kernel, this file will not be present.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/net/raw">/proc/net/raw</a></u>
              Holds a dump of the RAW socket table.  Much of the information is not of use apart from debugging.
              The "sl" value is the kernel hash slot for the socket, the "local_address" is  the  local  address
              and  protocol  number  pair.   "St"  is  the  internal  status  of the socket.  The "tx_queue" and
              "rx_queue" are the outgoing and incoming data queue in terms of kernel memory  usage.   The  "tr",
              "tm-&gt;when",  and "rexmits" fields are not used by RAW.  The "uid" field holds the effective UID of
              the creator of the socket.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/net/snmp">/proc/net/snmp</a></u>
              This file holds the ASCII data needed for the IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP management information  bases
              for an SNMP agent.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/net/tcp">/proc/net/tcp</a></u>
              Holds a dump of the TCP socket table.  Much of the information is not of use apart from debugging.
              The  "sl"  value  is the kernel hash slot for the socket, the "local_address" is the local address
              and port number pair.   The  "rem_address"  is  the  remote  address  and  port  number  pair  (if
              connected).   "St"  is  the  internal status of the socket.  The "tx_queue" and "rx_queue" are the
              outgoing and incoming data queue in terms of kernel  memory  usage.   The  "tr",  "tm-&gt;when",  and
              "rexmits"  fields  hold  internal  information  of the kernel socket state and are useful only for
              debugging.  The "uid" field holds the effective UID of the creator of the socket.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/net/udp">/proc/net/udp</a></u>
              Holds a dump of the UDP socket table.  Much of the information is not of use apart from debugging.
              The "sl" value is the kernel hash slot for the socket, the "local_address" is  the  local  address
              and  port  number  pair.   The  "rem_address"  is  the  remote  address  and  port number pair (if
              connected).  "St" is the internal status of the socket.  The "tx_queue"  and  "rx_queue"  are  the
              outgoing  and  incoming  data  queue  in  terms of kernel memory usage.  The "tr", "tm-&gt;when", and
              "rexmits" fields are not used by UDP.  The "uid" field holds the effective UID of the  creator  of
              the socket.  The format is:

              sl  local_address rem_address   st tx_queue rx_queue tr rexmits  tm-&gt;when uid
               1: 01642C89:0201 0C642C89:03FF 01 00000000:00000001 01:000071BA 00000000 0

       <u><a href="file:/proc/net/unix">/proc/net/unix</a></u>
              Lists the UNIX domain sockets present within the system and their status.  The format is:

              Num RefCount Protocol Flags    Type St Inode Path
               0: 00000002 00000000 00000000 0001 03    42
               1: 00000001 00000000 00010000 0001 01  1948 /dev/printer

              The fields are as follows:

              <u>Num</u>:      the kernel table slot number.

              <u>RefCount</u>: the number of users of the socket.

              <u>Protocol</u>: currently always 0.

              <u>Flags</u>:    the internal kernel flags holding the status of the socket.

              <u>Type</u>:     the  socket  type.  For <b>SOCK_STREAM</b> sockets, this is 0001; for <b>SOCK_DGRAM</b> sockets, it is
                        0002; and for <b>SOCK_SEQPACKET</b> sockets, it is 0005.

              <u>St</u>:       the internal state of the socket.

              <u>Inode</u>:    the inode number of the socket.

              <u>Path</u>:     the bound pathname (if any) of the  socket.   Sockets  in  the  abstract  namespace  are
                        included in the list, and are shown with a <u>Path</u> that commences with the character '@'.

       <u>/proc/net/netfilter/nfnetlink_queue</u>
              This file contains information about netfilter user-space queueing, if used.  Each line represents
              a queue.  Queues that have not been subscribed to by user space are not shown.

                     1   4207     0  2 65535     0     0        0  1
                    (1)   (2)    (3)(4)  (5)    (6)   (7)      (8)

              The fields in each line are:

              (1)  The  ID  of  the queue.  This matches what is specified in the <b>--queue-num</b> or <b>--queue-balance</b>
                   options to the <b><a href="../man8/iptables.8.html">iptables</a></b>(8) NFQUEUE target.  See <b><a href="../man8/iptables-extensions.8.html">iptables-extensions</a></b>(8) for more information.

              (2)  The netlink port ID subscribed to the queue.

              (3)  The number of packets currently queued and waiting to be processed by the application.

              (4)  The copy mode of the queue.  It is either 1 (metadata only) or 2 (also copy payload  data  to
                   user space).

              (5)  Copy range; that is, how many bytes of packet payload should be copied to user space at most.

              (6)  queue  dropped.   Number  of  packets  that  had to be dropped by the kernel because too many
                   packets are already waiting for user space to send back the mandatory accept/drop verdicts.

              (7)  queue user dropped.  Number of packets that were dropped within the netlink subsystem.   Such
                   drops usually happen when the corresponding socket buffer is full; that is, user space is not
                   able to read messages fast enough.

              (8)  sequence  number.  Every queued packet is associated with a (32-bit) monotonically increasing
                   sequence number.  This shows the ID of the most recent packet queued.

              The last number exists only for compatibility reasons and is always 1.
