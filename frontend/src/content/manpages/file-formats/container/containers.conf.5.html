</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       containers.conf  -  The  container  engine configuration file specifies default configuration options and
       command-line flags for container engines.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Container engines like Podman &amp; Buildah read containers.conf file, if it exists and modify  the  defaults
       for  running  containers  on the host. containers.conf uses a TOML format that can be easily modified and
       versioned.

       Container engines read the  <b>/usr/share/containers/containers.conf</b>,  <b>/etc/containers/containers.conf</b>,  and
       <b>/etc/containers/containers.conf.d/*.conf</b>  for  global  configuration  that  effects  all users.  For user
       specific      configuration      it      reads      <b>\$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/containers/containers.conf</b>      and
       <b>\$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/containers/containers.conf.d/*.conf</b>  files.  When  <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b> is not set it falls
       back to using <b>$HOME/.config</b> instead.

       Fields specified in containers conf override the default options, as well as options in  previously  read
       containers.conf files.

       Config files in the <b>.d</b> directories, are added in alpha numeric sorted order and must end in <b>.conf</b>.

       Not all options are supported in all container engines.

       Note, container engines also use other configuration files for configuring the environment.

              • <b>storage.conf</b> for configuration of container and images storage.

              • <b>registries.conf</b>  for  definition  of  container  registries  to search while pulling.  container
                images.

              • <b>policy.conf</b> for controlling which images can be pulled to the system.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       If the <b>CONTAINERS_CONF</b> environment variable is set, all system and user config files are ignored and only
       the specified config file will be loaded.

       If the <b>CONTAINERS_CONF_OVERRIDE</b> path environment variable is set, the config file  will  be  loaded  last
       even when <b>CONTAINERS_CONF</b> is set.

       The   values   of   both  environment  variables  may  be  absolute  or  relative  paths,  for  instance,
       <b>CONTAINERS_CONF=/tmp/my_containers.conf</b>.

</pre><h4><b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       A module is a containers.conf file located  directly  in  or  a  sub-directory  of  the  following  three
       directories:
        -                         <b>\$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/containers/containers.conf.modules</b>                        or
       <b>\$HOME/.config/containers/containers.conf.modules</b> if <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b> is not set.
        - <b>/etc/containers/containers.conf.modules</b>
        - <b>/usr/share/containers/containers.conf.modules</b>

       Files in those locations are not loaded by default but only on-demand.  They are loaded after all  system
       and user configuration files but before <b>CONTAINERS_CONF_OVERRIDE</b> hence allowing for overriding system and
       user configs.

       Modules  are  currently supported by <a href="../man1/podman.1.html">podman</a>(1).  The <b>podman</b> <b>--module</b> flag allows for loading a module and
       can be specified multiple times.  If the specified value is an absolute path, the  config  file  will  be
       loaded  directly.   Relative  paths are resolved relative to the three module directories mentioned above
       and in the specified order such that modules in <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/$HOME</b> allow for overriding those in <b><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></b>
       and <b><a href="file:/usr/share">/usr/share</a></b>.

</pre><h4><b>APPENDING</b> <b>TO</b> <b>STRING</b> <b>ARRAYS</b></h4><pre>
       The default behavior during the loading  sequence  of  multiple  containers.conf  files  is  to  override
       previous  data.  To change the behavior from overriding to appending, you can set the <b>append</b> attribute as
       follows: <b>array=["item-1",</b> <b>"item=2",</b> <b>...,</b> <b>{append=true}]</b>.   Setting  the  append  attribute  instructs  to
       append  to  this specific string array for the current and also subsequent loading steps.  To change back
       to overriding, set <b>{append=false}</b>.

       Consider the following example:

       modules1.conf: env=["1=true"]
       modules2.conf: env=["2=true"]
       modules3.conf: env=["3=true", {append=true}]
       modules4.conf: env=["4=true"]

       After loading the files in the given order, the final contents are  <b>env=["2=true",</b>  <b>"3=true",</b>  <b>"4=true"]</b>.
       If modules4.conf would set <b>{append=false}</b>, the final contents would be <b>env=["4=true"]</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The  TOML  format  ⟨https://github.com/toml-lang/toml⟩ is used as the encoding of the configuration file.
       Every option is nested under its table. No bare options are used. The format of TOML  can  be  simplified
       to:

       [table1]
       option = value

       [table2]
       option = value

       [table3]
       option = value

       [table3.subtable1]
       option = value

</pre><h4><b>CONTAINERS</b> <b>TABLE</b></h4><pre>
       The containers table contains settings to configure and manage the OCI runtime.

       <b>annotations</b> = []

       List of annotations. Specified as "key=value" pairs to be added to all containers.

       Example: "run.oci.keep_original_groups=1"

       <b>apparmor_profile</b>="container-default"

       Used  to  change the name of the default AppArmor profile of container engines.  The default profile name
       is "container-default".

       <b>base_hosts_file</b>=""

       Base file to create the <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b> file inside the container. This must either be an absolute path  to  a
       file on the host system, or one of the following special flags:
         ""      Use the host's <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b> file (the default)
         <b>none</b>  Do not use a base file (i.e. start with an empty file)
         <b>image</b> Use the container image's <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b> file as base file

       <b>cgroup_conf</b>=[]

       List  of  cgroup_conf entries specifying a list of cgroup files to write to and their values. For example
       <b>memory.high=1073741824</b> sets the memory.high limit to 1GB.

       <b>cgroups</b>="enabled"

       Determines  whether  the  container will create CGroups.  Options are:
         <b>enabled</b>   Enable cgroup support within container
         <b>disabled</b>  Disable cgroup support, will inherit cgroups from parent
         <b>no-conmon</b> Do not create a cgroup dedicated to conmon.

       <b>cgroupns</b>="private"

       Default way to create a cgroup namespace for the container.  Options are: <b>private</b> Create  private  Cgroup
       Namespace for the container.  <b>host</b>    Share host Cgroup Namespace with the container.

       <b>container_name_as_hostname</b>=true|false

       When  no  hostname  is  set  for  a  container, use the container's name, with characters not valid for a
       hostname removed, as the hostname instead of the first 12 characters of the  container's  ID.  Containers
       not  running in a private UTS namespace will have their hostname set to the host's hostname regardless of
       this setting.

       Default is false.

       <b>default_capabilities</b>=[]

       List of default capabilities for containers.

       The default list is:

       default_capabilities = [
             "CHOWN",
             "DAC_OVERRIDE",
             "FOWNER",
             "FSETID",
             "KILL",
             "NET_BIND_SERVICE",
             "SETFCAP",
             "SETGID",
             "SETPCAP",
             "SETUID",
             "SYS_CHROOT",
       ]

       Note, by default container engines using containers.conf, run with less capabilities than Docker.  Docker
       runs additionally with "AUDIT_WRITE", "MKNOD" and "NET_RAW". If you need to add one of these capabilities
       for a particular container, you can use the --cap-add option or edit your system's containers.conf.

       <b>default_sysctls</b>=[]

       A list of sysctls to be set in containers by default, specified as "name=value".

       Example:"net.ipv4.ping_group_range=0 1000".

       <b>default_ulimits</b>=[]

       A list of ulimits to be set in containers by default, specified as "name=soft-limit:hard-limit".

       Example: "nofile=1024:2048".

       <b>devices</b>=[]

       List of devices.  Specified as 'device-on-host:device-on-container:permissions'.

       Example: "/dev/sdc:/dev/xvdc:rwm".

       <b>dns_options</b>=[]

       List of default DNS options to be added to <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> inside of the container.

       <b>dns_searches</b>=[]

       List of default DNS search domains to be added to <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> inside of the container.

       <b>dns_servers</b>=[]

       A list of dns servers to override the DNS configuration passed to the container. The special value “none”
       can be specified to disable creation of <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> in the container.

       <b>env</b>=["PATH=<a href="file:/usr/local/sbin">/usr/local/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>:<a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>"]

       Environment  variable  list  for  the  container  process,  used for passing environment variables to the
       container.

       <b>env_host</b>=false

       Pass all host environment variables into the container.

       <b>host_containers_internal_ip</b>=""

       Set the IP address the container should expect to connect to the host. The IP address is used  by  Podman
       to  automatically  add the <b>host.containers.internal</b> and <b>host.docker.internal</b> hostnames to the container's
       <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b> file. It is also used for the <u>host-gateway</u> flag of Podman's <b>--add-host</b> CLI option.  If  no  IP
       address  is configured (the default), Podman will try to determine it automatically, but might fail to do
       so depending on the container's network setup. Adding these internal hostnames to <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b> is  silently
       skipped then.  Set this config to <b>none</b> to never add the internal hostnames to <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b>.

       Note:  If  Podman  is  running  in  a virtual machine using <b>podman</b> <b>machine</b> (this includes Mac and Windows
       hosts), Podman will silently skip adding the internal hostnames to <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b>, unless an IP  address  was
       configured manually. The internal hostnames are resolved by the gvproxy DNS resolver instead. This config
       has  no  effect on gvproxy. However, since <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b> bypasses the DNS resolver, a manually configured IP
       address still takes precedence.

       Note: This config doesn't affect the actual network setup, it just tells Podman the IP address it  should
       expect.  Configuring  an  IP  address  here doesn't ensure that the container can actually reach the host
       using this IP address.

       <b>http_proxy</b>=true

       Default proxy environment variables will be passed into the container.  The environment variables  passed
       in  include:  <b>http_proxy</b>,  <b>https_proxy</b>,  <b>ftp_proxy</b>,  <b>no_proxy</b>,  and the upper case versions of these. The
       <b>no_proxy</b> option is needed when host system uses a  proxy  but  container  should  not  use  proxy.  Proxy
       environment  variables  specified for the container in any other way will override the values passed from
       the host.

       <b>init</b>=false

       Run an init inside the container that forwards signals and reaps processes.

       <b>init_path</b>="/usr/libexec/podman/catatonit"

       If this option is not set catatonit is searched in the directories listed under  the  <b>helper_binaries_dir</b>
       option. It is recommended to just install catatonit there instead of configuring this option here.

       Path  to  the  container-init  binary, which forwards signals and reaps processes within containers. Note
       that the container-init binary will only be used when the <b>--init</b> for podman-create and podman-run is set.

       <b>interface_name</b>=""

       Default way to set interface names inside containers. Defaults to legacy pattern of ethX, where X  is  an
       integer, when left undefined.  Options are:
         <b>device</b>    Uses  the network_interface name from the network config as interface name. Falls back to the
       ethX pattern if the network_interface is not set.

       <b>ipcns</b>="shareable"

       Default way to create a IPC namespace for the container.  Options are:
         <b>host</b>     Share host IPC Namespace with the container.
         <b>none</b>     Create shareable IPC Namespace for the container without a private /dev/shm.
         <b>private</b>  Create private IPC Namespace for the container, other containers are not allowed to share it.
         <b>shareable</b> Create shareable IPC Namespace for the container.

       <b>keyring</b>=true

       Indicates whether the container engines create a kernel keyring for use within the container.

       <b>label</b>=true

       Indicates whether the container engine uses MAC(SELinux) container separation via labeling.  This  option
       is ignored on disabled systems.

       <b>label_users</b>=false

       label_users  indicates  whether  to  enforce confined users in containers on SELinux systems. This option
       causes containers to maintain the current user and role field of the calling process. By default  SELinux
       containers run with the user system_u, and the role system_r.

       <b>log_driver</b>=""

       Logging  driver  for  the  container.  Currently  available  options  are  k8s-file,  journald,  none and
       passthrough, with json-file aliased to k8s-file for scripting compatibility.  The journald driver is used
       by default if the systemd journal is readable and writable.  Otherwise, the k8s-file driver is used.

       <b>log_size_max</b>=-1

       Maximum size allowed for the container's log file. Negative  numbers  indicate  that  no  size  limit  is
       imposed.  If  it  is  positive,  it  must  be  &gt;=  8192 to match/exceed conmon's read buffer. The file is
       truncated and re-opened so the limit is never exceeded.

       <b>log_tag</b>=""

       Default format tag for container log messages. This is useful for creating a specific tag  for  container
       log messages. Container log messages default to using the truncated container ID as a tag.

       <b>mounts</b>=[]

       List of mounts.  Specified as "type=TYPE,source=,destination=,"

       Example:  [ "type=bind,source=/var/lib/foobar,destination=/var/lib/foobar,ro", ]

       <b>netns</b>="private"

       Default way to create a NET namespace for the container.  Options are:
         <b>private</b> Create private NET Namespace for the container.
         <b>host</b>    Share host NET Namespace with the container.
         <b>none</b>    Containers do not use the network.

       <b>no_hosts</b>=false

       Do  not  modify  the  <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b>  file  in  the  container.  Podman  assumes control over the container's
       <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b> file by default; refer to the <b>--add-host</b> CLI option for details. To disable this,  either  set
       this config to <b>true</b>, or use the functionally identical <b>--no-hosts</b> CLI option.

       <b>oom_score_adj</b>=0

       Tune the host's OOM preferences for containers (accepts values from -1000 to 1000).

       <b>pidns</b>="private"

       Default way to create a PID namespace for the container.  Options are:
         <b>private</b> Create private PID Namespace for the container.
         <b>host</b>    Share host PID Namespace with the container.

       <b>pids_limit</b>=1024

       Maximum number of processes allowed in a container. 0 indicates that no limit is imposed.

       <b>prepare_volume_on_create</b>=false

       Copy  the  content  from the underlying image into the newly created volume when the container is created
       instead of when it is started. If <b>false</b>, the container  engine  will  not  copy  the  content  until  the
       container is started. Setting it to <b>true</b> may have negative performance implications.

       <b>privileged</b>=false

       Give  extended  privileges to all containers. A privileged container turns off the security features that
       isolate the container from the host. Dropped  Capabilities,  limited  devices,  read-only  mount  points,
       Apparmor/SELinux separation, and Seccomp filters are all disabled. Due to the disabled security features,
       the privileged field should almost never be set as containers can easily break out of confinment.

       Containers  running  in a user namespace (e.g., rootless containers) cannot have more privileges than the
       user that launched them.

       <b>read_only</b>=true|false

       Run all containers with root file system mounted read-only. Set to false by default.

       <b>seccomp_profile</b>="/usr/share/containers/seccomp.json"

       Path to the seccomp.json profile which is used as the default seccomp profile for the runtime.

       <b>shm_size</b>="65536k"

       Size of <b><a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a></b>. The format is <b>&lt;number&gt;&lt;unit&gt;</b>. <b>number</b> must be greater than <b>0</b>.  Unit is optional and  can
       be:  <b>b</b>  (bytes),  <b>k</b>  (kilobytes),  <b><a href="../manmegabytes/m.megabytes.html">m</a></b>(megabytes), or <b>g</b> (gigabytes).  If you omit the unit, the system uses
       bytes. If you omit the size entirely, the system uses <b>65536k</b>.

       <b>tz=</b>""

       Set timezone in container. Takes IANA timezones as  well  as  <b>local</b>,  which  sets  the  timezone  in  the
       container  to  match the host machine.  If not set, then containers will run with the time zone specified
       in the image.

       Examples:
         <b>tz="local"</b>
         <b>tz="America/New_York"</b>

       <b>umask</b>="0022"

       Sets umask inside the container.

       <b>userns</b>="host"

       Default way to create a USER namespace for the container.  Options are:
         <b>private</b> Create private USER Namespace for the container.
         <b>host</b>    Share host USER Namespace with the container.

       <b>utsns</b>="private"

       Default way to create a UTS namespace for the container.  Options are:
         <b>private</b> Create private UTS Namespace for the container.
         <b>host</b>    Share host UTS Namespace with the container.

       <b>volumes</b>=[]

       List of volumes.  Specified as "directory-on-host:directory-in-container:options".

       Example:  "/db:/var/lib/db:ro".

</pre><h4><b>NETWORK</b> <b>TABLE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>network</b> table contains settings pertaining to the management of CNI plugins.

       <b>network_backend</b>=""

       Network backend determines what network driver will be used to set up and tear down  container  networks.
       Valid values are "cni" and "netavark".  The default value is empty which means that it will automatically
       choose CNI or netavark. If there are already containers/images or CNI networks preset it will choose CNI.

       Before  changing this value all containers must be stopped otherwise it is likely that iptables rules and
       network interfaces might leak on the host. A reboot will fix this.

       <b>cni_plugin_dirs</b>=[]

       List of paths to directories where CNI plugin binaries are located.

       The default list is:

       cni_plugin_dirs = [
         "/usr/local/libexec/cni",
         "/usr/libexec/cni",
         "/usr/local/lib/cni",
         "/usr/lib/cni",
         "/opt/cni/bin",
       ]

       <b>netavark_plugin_dirs</b>=[]

       List of directories that will be searched for netavark plugins.

       The default list is:

       netavark_plugin_dirs = [
         "/usr/local/libexec/netavark",
         "/usr/libexec/netavark",
         "/usr/local/lib/netavark",
         "/usr/lib/netavark",
       ]

       <b>default_network</b>="podman"

       The network name of the default network to attach pods to.

       <b>default_subnet</b>="10.88.0.0/16"

       The subnet to use for the default network (named above in <b>default_network</b>).  If the default network  does
       not exist, it will be automatically created the first time a tool is run using this subnet.

       <b>default_subnet_pools</b>=[]

       DefaultSubnetPools  is  a  list  of subnets and size which are used to allocate subnets automatically for
       podman network create.  It will iterate through the list and will pick the first  free  subnet  with  the
       given size. This is only used for ipv4 subnets, ipv6 subnets are always assigned randomly.

       The default list is (10.89.0.0-10.255.255.0/24):

       default_subnet_pools = [
         {"base" = "10.89.0.0/16", "size" = 24},
         {"base" = "10.90.0.0/15", "size" = 24},
         {"base" = "10.92.0.0/14", "size" = 24},
         {"base" = "10.96.0.0/11", "size" = 24},

       Configure  which  rootless  network  program  to  use by default. Valid options are <b>slirp4netns</b> and <b>pasta</b>
       (default).

       <b>network_config_dir</b>="/etc/cni/net.d/"

       Path to the directory where network configuration files are located.  For the CNI backend the default  is
       <b>/etc/cni/net.d</b>   as   root   and   <b>$HOME/.config/cni/net.d</b>   as   rootless.   For  the  netavark  backend
       "/etc/containers/networks" is used as root and "$graphroot/networks" as rootless.

       <b>firewall_driver</b>=""

       The firewall driver to be used by netavark.  The default is empty which  means  netavark  will  pick  one
       accordingly.  Current  supported  drivers  are  "iptables", "nftables", "none" (no firewall rules will be
       created) and "firewalld" (firewalld is experimental at the moment and not recommend outside of testing).

       <b>dns_bind_port</b>=53

       Port to use for dns forwarding daemon with netavark in rootful bridge mode and  dns  enabled.   Using  an
       alternate port might be useful if other dns services should run on the machine.

       <b>pasta_options</b> = []

       Name of destination for accessing the Podman service. See SERVICE DESTINATION TABLE below.

       <b>add_compression</b>=[]

       List of compression algorithms. If set makes sure that requested compression variant for each platform is
       added to the manifest list keeping original instance intact in the same manifest list on  every  <b>manifest</b>
       <b>push</b>.  Supported  values are (<b>gzip</b>, <b>zstd</b> and <b>zstd:chunked</b>).  <b>zstd:chunked</b> is incompatible with encrypting
       images, and will be treated as <b>zstd</b> with a warning in that case.

       Note: This is different from <b>compression_format</b> which allows users to select a default compression format
       for <b>push</b> and <b>manifest</b> <b>push</b>, while <b>add_compression</b> is limited to <b>manifest</b> <b>push</b> and allows users to  append
       new  instances  to  manifest  list  with  specified  compression  algorithms  in <b>add_compression</b> for each
       platform.

       <b>cgroup_manager</b>="systemd"

       The cgroup management implementation used for the runtime. Supports <b>cgroupfs</b> and <b>systemd</b>.

       <b>compat_api_enforce_docker_hub</b>=true

       Enforce using docker.io for completing short names in Podman's compatibility REST  API.  Note  that  this
       will    ignore    unqualified-search-registries   and   short-name   aliases   defined   in   <a href="../man5/containersregistries.conf.5.html">containers-</a>
       <a href="../man5/containersregistries.conf.5.html">registries.conf</a>(5).

       <b>compose_providers</b>=[]

       Specify one or more external providers for the compose command.  The first found  provider  is  used  for
       execution.  Can be an absolute and relative path or a (file) name.

       <b>compose_warning_logs</b>=true

       Emit logs on each invocation of the compose command indicating that an external compose provider is being
       executed.

       <b>conmon_env_vars</b>=[]

       Environment variables to pass into Conmon.

       <b>conmon_path</b>=[]

       Paths  to  search  for  the  conmon container manager binary. If the paths are empty or no valid path was
       found, then the <b>$PATH</b> environment variable will be used as the fallback.

       The default list is:

           "/run/current-system/sw/bin/conmon",
       ]

       <b>database_backend</b>=""

       The database backend of Podman.  Supported values are "" (default), "boltdb" and "sqlite". An empty value
       means it will check whenever a boltdb already exists and use it when  it  does,  otherwise  it  will  use
       sqlite  as  default  (e.g.  new  installs).  This allows for backwards compatibility with older versions.
       Please run <b>podman-system-reset</b> prior to changing the database backend of an existing deployment, to  make
       sure Podman can operate correctly.

       <b>detach_keys</b>="ctrl-p,ctrl-q"

       Keys  sequence  used  for  detaching  a container.  Specify the keys sequence used to detach a container.
       Format is a single character <b>[a-Z]</b> or a comma separated sequence of <b>ctrl-&lt;value&gt;</b>, where  <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>  is  one
       of: <b>a-z</b>, <b>@</b>, <b>^</b>, <b>[</b>, <b>\</b>, <b>]</b>, <b>^</b> or <b>_</b> Specifying "" disables this feature.

       <b>enable_port_reservation</b>=true

       Determines  whether the engine will reserve ports on the host when they are forwarded to containers. When
       enabled, when ports are forwarded to containers, they are held open by conmon as long as the container is
       running, ensuring that they cannot be reused by other programs on  the  host.  However,  this  can  cause
       significant memory usage if a container has many ports forwarded to it.  Disabling this can save memory.

       <b>env</b>=[]

       Environment  variables  to be used when running the container engine (e.g., Podman, Buildah). For example
       "http_proxy=internal.proxy.company.com".  Note these environment variables will not be  used  within  the
       container. Set the env section under [containers] table, if you want to set environment variables for the
       container.

       <b>events_logfile_path</b>=""

       Define where event logs will be stored, when events_logger is "file".

       <b>events_logfile_max_size</b>="1m"

       Sets  the  maximum size for events_logfile_path.  The unit can be b (bytes), k (kilobytes), m (megabytes)
       or g (gigabytes).  The format for the size is <b>&lt;number&gt;&lt;unit&gt;</b>, e.g., <b>1b</b> or <b>3g</b>.  If  no  unit  is  included
       then  the size will be in bytes.  When the limit is exceeded, the logfile will be rotated and the old one
       will be deleted.  If the maximum size is set to 0, then no limit will be applied, and  the  logfile  will
       not be rotated.

       <b>events_logger</b>="journald"

       The default method to use when logging events.

       The  default  method  is different based on the platform that Podman is being run upon.  To determine the
       current value, use this command:

       <b>podman</b> <b>info</b> <b>--format</b> <b>{{.Host.EventLogger}}</b>

       Valid values are: <b>file</b>, <b>journald</b>, and <b>none</b>.

       <b>events_container_create_inspect_data</b>=true|false

       Creates a more verbose container-create event which includes a JSON  payload  with  detailed  information
       about the container.  Set to false by default.

       <b>healthcheck_events</b>=true|false

       Whenever  Podman  should  log healthcheck events.  With many running healthcheck on short interval Podman
       will spam the event log a lot as it generates a event for each single healthcheck run. Because this event
       is optional and only useful to external consumers that may want to know when  a  healthcheck  is  run  or
       failed allow users to turn it off by setting it to false.

       Default is true.

       <b>helper_binaries_dir</b>=["/usr/libexec/podman", ...]

       A  is  a  list  of  directories which are used to search for helper binaries.  The following binaries are
       searched in these directories:

       Directories to scan for CDI Spec files.

       <b>image_default_format</b>="oci"|"v2s2"|"v2s1"

       Manifest Type (oci, v2s2, or v2s1) to use when pulling, pushing, building container  images.  By  default
       images  pulled  and  pushed  match  the  format of the source image. Building/committing defaults to OCI.
       Note: <b>image_build_format</b> is deprecated.

       <b>image_default_transport</b>="docker://"

       Default transport method for pulling and pushing images.

       <b>image_parallel_copies</b>=0

       Maximum number of image layers to be copied (pulled/pushed) simultaneously.  Not setting this field  will
       fall back to containers/image defaults. (6)

       <b>image_volume_mode</b>="bind"

       Tells container engines how to handle the built-in image volumes.

              • bind: An anonymous named volume will be  created  and  mounted into the container.

              • tmpfs:  The  volume  is  mounted onto the container as a tmpfs, which allows the users to create
                content that disappears when the container is stopped.

              • ignore: All volumes are just ignored and no action is taken.

       <b>infra_command</b>="/pause"

       Infra (pause) container image command for pod infra containers. When running a pod,  we  start  a  <b>/pause</b>
       process  in  a container to hold open the namespaces associated with the pod. This container does nothing
       other than sleep, reserving the pod's resources for the lifetime of the pod.

       <b>infra_image</b>=""

       Infra (pause) container image for pod infra containers. When running a pod, we start a <b>pause</b> process in a
       container to hold open the namespaces associated with the pod. This container  does  nothing  other  than
       sleep,  reserving  the  pod's  resources  for the lifetime of the pod. By default container engines run a
       built-in container using the pause executable. If you want override specify an image to pull.

       <b>kube_generate_type</b>="pod"

       Default Kubernetes kind/specification of the kubernetes yaml generated  with  the  <b>podman</b>  <b>kube</b>  <b>generate</b>
       command. The possible options are <b>pod</b> and <b>deployment</b>.

       <b>lock_type</b>="shm"

       Specify  the locking mechanism to use; valid values are "shm" and "file".  Change the default only if you
       are sure of what you are doing, in general "file" is useful only on platforms where cgo is not  available
       for  using  the faster "shm" lock type. You may need to run "podman system renumber" after you change the
       lock type.

       <b>multi_image_archive</b>=false

       Allows for creating archives (e.g., tarballs) with more than one image. Some container engines,  such  as
       Podman,  interpret additional arguments as tags for one image and hence do not store more than one image.
       The default behavior can be altered with this option.

       <b>namespace</b>=""

       Default engine namespace. If the engine is joined to a namespace, it will see only  containers  and  pods
       that  were  created in the same namespace, and will create new containers and pods in that namespace. The
       default namespace is "", which corresponds to no namespace. When no namespace is set, all containers  and
       pods are visible.

       <b>network_cmd_path</b>=""

       Path to the slirp4netns binary.

       <b>network_cmd_options</b>=[]

       Default options to pass to the slirp4netns binary.

       Valid options values are:

              • <b>allow_host_loopback=true|false</b>:  Allow the slirp4netns to reach the host loopback IP (<b>10.0.2.2</b>).
                Default is false.

              • <b>mtu=MTU</b>: Specify the MTU to use for this network. (Default is <b>65520</b>).

              • <b>cidr=CIDR</b>: Specify ip range to use for this network. (Default is <b>10.0.2.0/24</b>).

              • <b>enable_ipv6=true|false</b>: Enable IPv6. Default is true. (Required for <b>outbound_addr6</b>).

              • <b>outbound_addr=INTERFACE</b>: Specify the outbound interface  slirp  should  bind  to  (ipv4  traffic
                only).

              • <b>outbound_addr=IPv4</b>: Specify the outbound ipv4 address slirp should bind to.

              • <b>outbound_addr6=INTERFACE</b>:  Specify  the  outbound  interface  slirp should bind to (ipv6 traffic
                only).

              • <b>outbound_addr6=IPv6</b>: Specify the outbound ipv6 address slirp should bind to.

              • <b>port_handler=rootlesskit</b>: Use rootlesskit  for  port  forwarding.  Default.   Note:  Rootlesskit
                changes  the  source  IP  address  of  incoming packets to a IP address in the container network
                namespace, usually <b>10.0.2.100</b>. If your application requires the real source IP address, e.g. web
                server logs, use the slirp4netns port handler. The rootlesskit port handler  is  also  used  for
                rootless containers when connected to user-defined networks.

              • <b>port_handler=slirp4netns</b>: Use the slirp4netns port forwarding, it is slower than rootlesskit but
                preserves  the  correct  source  IP  address.  This port handler cannot be used for user-defined
                networks.

       <b>no_pivot_root</b>=false

       Whether to use chroot instead of pivot_root in the runtime.

       <b>num_locks</b>=2048

       Number of locks available for containers, pods, and volumes.  Each  created  container,  pod,  or  volume
       consumes  one  lock.  Locks are recycled and can be reused after the associated container, pod, or volume
       is removed.  The default number available is 2048.  If this  is  changed,  a  lock  renumbering  must  be
       performed, using the <b>podman</b> <b>system</b> <b>renumber</b> command.

       <b>pod_exit_policy</b>="continue"

       Set the exit policy of the pod when the last container exits.  Supported policies are:

       ┌─────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────┐
       │ <b>Exit</b> <b>Policy</b> │ <b>Description</b>                           │

       │             │ last   container   exits.   Used   by │
       │             │ default.                              │
       ├─────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────┤
       │ <u>stop</u>        │ The  pod  is  stopped  when  the last │
       │             │ container exits. Used in <b>play</b> <b>kube</b>.   │
       └─────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────┘

       <b>pull_policy</b>="always"|"missing"|"never"

       Pull image before running or creating a container. The default is <b>missing</b>.

              • <b>missing</b>: attempt to pull the latest image from the registries listed  in  registries.conf  if  a
                local image does not exist. Raise an error if the image is not in any listed registry and is not
                present locally.

              • <b>always</b>:  pull  the  image  from  the first registry it is found in as listed in registries.conf.
                Raise an error if not found in the registries, even if the image is present locally.

              • <b>never</b>: do not pull the image from the registry, use only the local version. Raise  an  error  if
                the image is not present locally.

       <b>remote</b> = false

       Indicates  whether  the  application  should  be  running in remote mode. This flag modifies the --remote
       option on container engines. Setting the flag to true will default <b>podman</b> <b>--remote=true</b> for access to the
       remote Podman service.

       <b>retry</b> = 3

       Number of times to retry pulling/pushing images in case of failure.

       <b>retry_delay</b> = ""

       Delay between retries in case pulling/pushing image fails. If set, container engines will  retry  at  the
       set interval, otherwise they delay 2 seconds and then exponentially back off.

       <b>runtime</b>=""

       Default  OCI  specific  runtime  in  runtimes that will be used by default. Must refer to a member of the
       runtimes table. Default runtime will be searched for on the system using the  priority:  "crun",  "runc",
       "runj", "kata", "runsc", "ocijail"

       <b>runtime_supports_json</b>=["crun", "crun-vm", "runc", "kata", "runsc", "youki", "krun"]

       <b>image_copy_tmp_dir</b>="<a href="file:/var/tmp">/var/tmp</a>"

       Default  location  for  storing  temporary  container  image  content.  Can be overridden with the TMPDIR
       environment variable. If you specify "storage", then the location of the container/storage tmp  directory
       will  be  used. If set then it is the users responsibility to cleanup storage. Configure <a href="../man5/tmpfiles.d.5.html">tmpfiles.d</a>(5) to
       cleanup storage.

       <b>service_timeout</b>=<b>5</b>

       Number of seconds to wait without a connection  before the <b>podman</b> <b>system</b> <b>service</b> times out and exits

       <b>static_dir</b>="/var/lib/containers/storage/libpod"

       where containers/storage stores containers.

       <b>stop_timeout</b>=10

       Number of seconds to wait for container to exit before sending kill signal.

       <b>exit_command_delay</b>=300

       Number of seconds to wait for the API process for the exec call before sending exit command mimicking the

       The path to a temporary directory to store per-boot container.  Must be a tmpfs (wiped after reboot).

       <b>volume_path</b>="/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes"

       Directory  where  named volumes will be created in using the default volume driver.  By default this will
       be configured relative to where containers/storage store containers. This convention is followed  by  the
       default volume driver, but may not be by other drivers.

       <b>chown_copied_files</b>=true

       Determines whether file copied into a container will have changed ownership to the primary uid/gid of the
       container.

       <b>compression_format</b>="gzip"

       Specifies  the  compression  format  to  use  when pushing an image. Supported values are: <b>gzip</b>, <b>zstd</b> and
       <b>zstd:chunked</b>. This field is ignored when pushing images to the docker-daemon and docker-archive  formats.
       It is also ignored when the manifest format is set to v2s2.  <b>zstd:chunked</b> is incompatible with encrypting
       images, and will be treated as <b>zstd</b> with a warning in that case.

       <b>compression_level</b>="5"

       The  compression level to use when pushing an image. Valid options depend on the compression format used.
       For gzip, valid options are 1-9, with a default of 5. For zstd, valid options are 1-20, with a default of

       plugin will be called) to its path (filepath of the plugin's unix socket).

       <b>[engine.platform_to_oci_runtime]</b>

       Allows  end users to switch the OCI runtime on the bases of container image's platform string.  Following
       config field contains a map of <b>platform/string</b> <b>=</b> <b>oci_runtime</b>.

       Memory in MB a machine is created with.

       <b>user</b>=""

       Username  to  use and create on the podman machine OS for rootless container access. The default value is
       <b>user</b>. On Linux/Mac the default is<b>core</b>.

       <b>volumes</b>=["$HOME:$HOME"]

       Host directories to be mounted as volumes into the VM by default.  Environment variables  like  $HOME  as
       well  as  complete paths are supported for the source and destination. An optional third field <b>:ro</b> can be
       used to tell the container engines to mount the volume readonly.

       On Mac, the default volumes are:

       [ "/Users:/Users", "/private:/private", "/var/folders:/var/folders" ]

       <b>provider</b>=""

       Virtualization provider to be used for running a podman-machine VM. Empty value  is  interpreted  as  the
       default provider for the current host OS.

       <b>rosetta</b>="true"

       Rosetta  supports  running x86_64 Linux binaries on a Podman machine on Apple silicon.  The default value
       is <b>true</b>. Supported on AppleHV(arm64) machines only.

</pre><h4><b>FARMS</b> <b>TABLE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>farms</b> table contains configuration options used to group up remote connections into farms  that  will
       be used when sending out builds to different machines in a farm via <b>podman</b> <b>buildfarm</b>.

       <b>default</b>=""

       The default farm to use when farming out builds.

       <b>[farms.list]</b>

       Map of farms created where the key is the farm name and the value is the list of system connections.

</pre><h4><b>PODMANSH</b> <b>TABLE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>podmansh</b> table contains configuration options used by podmansh.

       <b>shell</b>="<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>"

       The shell to spawn in the container.  The default value is <b><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></b>.

       <b>container</b>="podmansh"

       Name of the container that podmansh joins.  The default value is <b>podmansh</b>.

       <b>timeout</b>=0

       Number  of  seconds  to  wait  for  podmansh  logins.  This  value  if favoured over the deprecated field
       <b>engine.podmansh_timeout</b> if set.  The default value is 30.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>containers.conf</b>

       Distributions  often  provide  a  <b>/usr/share/containers/containers.conf</b>  file  to   provide   a   default
       configuration.     Administrators     can     override     fields    in    this    file    by    creating
       <b>/etc/containers/containers.conf</b> to specify their own configuration. They may also  drop  <b>.conf</b>  files  in
       <b>/etc/containers/containers.conf.d</b>  which  will  be  loaded  in  alphanumeric  order.   For  user specific
       configuration         it         reads          <b>\$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/containers/containers.conf</b>          and
       <b>\$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/containers/containers.conf.d/*.conf</b>  files.  When  <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b> is not set it falls
       back to using <b>$HOME/.config</b> instead.

       Fields specified in a containers.conf file override the default options, as well as options in previously
       loaded containers.conf files.

       <b>storage.conf</b>

       The <b>/etc/containers/storage.conf</b> file is the default storage  configuration  file.   Rootless  users  can
       override fields in the storage config by creating <b>$HOME/.config/containers/storage.conf</b>.

       If  the  <b>CONTAINERS_STORAGE_CONF</b> path environment variable is set, this path is used for the storage.conf
       file rather than the default.  This is primarily used for testing.
