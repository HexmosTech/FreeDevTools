</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tuned.conf - TuneD profile definition

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  man  page documents format of TuneD 2.0 profile definition files.  The profile definition is stored
       in /etc/tuned/profiles/&lt;profile_name&gt;/tuned.conf or in  /usr/lib/tuned/profiles/&lt;profile_name&gt;/tuned.conf
       file where the /etc/tuned/profiles/ directory has higher priority.

       The <b>tuned.conf</b> configures the profile and it is in ini-file format.

</pre><h4><b>MAIN</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       The main section is called "[main]" and can contain following options:

       include=
              Includes  a  profile  with  the  given  name.  This allows you to base a new profile on an already
              existing profile. In case there are conflicting  parameters  in  the  new  profile  and  the  base
              profile, the parameters from the new profile are used.

</pre><h4><b>PLUGINS</b></h4><pre>
       Every  other  section  defines  one plugin. The name of the section is used as name for the plugin and is
       used in logs to identify the plugin. There can be only one plugin of particular  type  tuning  particular
       device.  Conflicts  are  by  default  fixed  by merging the options of both plugins together. This can be
       changed by "replace" option.

       Every plugin section can contain following sections:

       type=  Plugin type. Currently there  are  following  upstream  plugins:  audio,  bootloader,  cpu,  disk,
              eeepc_she,  modules,  mounts,  net, script, scsi_host, selinux, scheduler, sysctl, sysfs, systemd,
              usb, video, vm. This list may be incomplete. If you installed  TuneD  through  RPM  you  can  list
              upstream  plugins by the following command: <b>rpm</b> <b>-ql</b> <b>tuned</b> <b>|</b> <b>grep</b> <b>'plugins/plugin_.*.py$'</b> Check the
              plugins directory returned by this command to see all plugins (e.g. plugins provided by 3rd  party
              packages).

       devices=
              Comma  separated  list of devices which should be tuned by this plugin instance.  If you omit this
              option, all found devices will be tuned.

       replace=1
              If there is conflict between two plugins (meaning two plugins of  the  same  type  are  trying  to
              configure  the  same devices), then the plugin defined as last replaces all options defined by the
              previously defined plugin.

       Plugins can also have plugin related options.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       [main]
       # Includes plugins defined in "included" profile.
       include=included

       # Define my_sysctl plugin
       [my_sysctl]
       type=sysctl
       # This plugin will replace any sysctl plugin defined in "included" profile
       replace=1
       # 256 KB default performs well experimentally.
       net.core.rmem_default = 262144
       net.core.wmem_default = 262144

       # Define my_script plugin
       # Both scripts (profile.sh from this profile and script from "included"
       # profile) will be run, because if there is no "replace=1" option the
       # default action is merge.
       [my_script]
       type=script
       script=${i:PROFILE_DIR}/profile.sh
