<b>transpec</b>(5)                                    File Formats Manual                                   <b>transpec</b>(5)

</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       <b>transpec</b> - translation specification for <b>instant</b>

</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
       <b>file.ts</b>

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>transpec</b>  file  is  used  by  the <b>instant</b> program to translate an SGML document instance to a format
       suitable for a formatting application.  The convention is to name the file with the suffix <b>.ts</b>.

       A <b>transpec</b> file is composed  of  a  number  of  individual  translation  specs.   Each  translation  spec
       (transpec)  is  made  up  of a number of fields, one per line.  Translation specs are separated by a line
       with a leading dash.  Text after the dash is ignored.  Fields are composed of two parts,  a  name  and  a
       value,  separated  by  a colon.  The colon must immediately follow the name, and any amount of whitespace
       (blanks and tabs) may be present between the colon and value.  Values  should  not  be  quoted,  and  you
       should be careful of trailing spaces.  (Trailing space will be considered part of the value.)  Quotes, if
       they  appear,  will  be  considered  part  of  the value of the fields.  Lines that begin with whitespace
       (blanks and tabs) are a continuation  of  the  previous  line;  the  leading  space  is  ignored.   These
       characteristics  are very similar to those of e-mail headers.  Lines beginning with a <b>#</b> (number sign) are
       comments and blank lines are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>Field</b> <b>Descriptions</b></h4><pre>
       Some fields are for identifying criteria that determines if a particular spec matches an element  in  the
       instance.   Others specify what action is to take place when a match happens, such as sending text to the
       output stream.

   <b>Criteria</b> <b>fields</b>
       Criteria fields restrict the conditions under which a single translation spec will apply.  If each  field
       specified  in a particular transpec matches an element under consideration in the document instance, then
       that translation spec is said to match. The appropriate actions, as specified  in  that  spec,  are  then
       taken.   The program, <b>instant</b>, searches the list of transpecs in the order given in the file.  Therefore,
       the more restrictive specs (those with more criteria) should appear before less restrictive ones.

       For quick reference, this is a brief summary of the possible criteria fields for translation. A  complete
       discussion of each follows.

       <b>Field</b> <b>Label</b>   <b>Field</b> <b>Value</b>        <b>Description</b>
       GI            gi ...             name of this GI
       AttValue      attname reg-expr   current element has attribute with value
       Content       reg-expr           is reg-expr in char content&gt;
       Context       context            element context, up the tree
       NthChild      number             current element is Nth child of its parent
       PAttSet       attname (val)      parent has this attribute set (optional to value val)
       Relation      relationship gi    gi has relationship to current element
       VarREValue    var REvalue        variable is set to regular expression value
       VarValue      var value          variable is set to value

       <b>GI:</b> <u>gi</u> [...]
              <u>gi</u>  is  the  name  of  the generic identifier, or element name, to consider.  More than one GI may
              appear in this field.

       <b>AttValue:</b> <u>attname</u> <u>regular-expression</u>
              This is an attribute name-value pair, where <u>attname</u> is an  attribute  if  the  GI.   The  <u>regular-</u>
              <u>expression</u>  is  of  the  form  accepted  by  the unix program <b>egrep</b>.  This pair is compared to the
              corresponding attribute name-value pairs of the GI under consideration.   To  simply  test  if  an
              attribute us set, use <b>.</b> (a dot) for <u>regular-expression</u>.  There may be more than one of these lines
              for each transpec.

       <b>Content:</b> <u>regular-expression</u>
              This specifies that the character content of GI contains a string matching the <u>regular-expression</u>.

       <b>Context:</b> <u>context</u>
              This  specifies  the  <u>context</u>  in  which  to  apply this translation spec.  It is either a list of
              generic identifiers or a regular expression describing a list of generic identifiers,  looking  up
              the hierarchy.  The first is the parent of the GI.

       <b>NthChild:</b> <u>number</u>
              This  specifies  that  the  GI is the <u>number</u>th child element of its parent.  Children are numbered
              starting with <b>1</b>.  Negative numbers may be used to indicate order counting backwards.  For example,
              -1 denotes the last child.

       <b>PAttSet:</b> <u>attname</u>
              This specifies that the parent has this attribute, <u>attname</u>, set to any  value  (not  IMPLIED).   A
              value to match may optionally be specified after attname.

       <b>Relation:</b> <u>relationship</u> <u>gi</u>
              This  specifies  that  the  current  element has the <u>relationship</u> to the named <u>gi</u>.  The acceptable
              relationships are: <b>ancestor</b> (anywhere up the tree), <b>child</b> (immediate child), <b>descendant</b>  (anywhere
              down  the  tree),  <b>parent</b> (immediate ancestor), <b>sibling</b> (share same parent element), <b>sibling+</b> (any
              later sibling), <b>sibling+1</b> (the immediately following sibling),  <b>sibling-</b>  (any  earlier  sibling),
              <b>sibling-1</b> (the immediately following sibling).

       <b>VarREValue:</b> <u>varname</u> <u>REvalue</u>
              This  specifies that the global variable <u>varname</u> has the value <u>REvalue</u>, where <u>REvalue</u> is a regular
              expression (see the <b>VarValue</b> statement).

       <b>VarValue:</b> <u>varname</u> <u>value</u>
              This specifies that the global variable <u>varname</u> has the (literal) value <u>value</u> (see the  <b>VarREValue</b>
              statement).

       There  are  two  special  GIs.   If  specified,  <b>_Start</b> and <b>_End</b> are processed as if they were GIs in the
       instance at the start and end of the translation, respectively.  Their criteria are never checked.   Only
       their actions are performed.

   <b>Action</b> <b>fields</b>
       For  quick  reference,  this  is  a  brief  summary  of  the action fields for translation. They are only
       performed if all the criteria are satisfied.  A complete discussion of each follows.

       <b>Field</b> <b>Label</b>   <b>Field</b> <b>Value</b>   <b>Description</b>
       Action        spec-id       use transpec whose spec ID is `spec-id'
       EndText       text          text for end of element
       Increment     name          increment variable `name'
       Ignore        key           flag for ignoring element's children and/or data
       Message       text          text to send to stderr
       Quit          text          print text and quit program
       Replace       text          replace this subtree with text
       Set           name value    set variable <u>name</u> to <u>value</u>
       SpecID        spec-id       unique Spec ID (int) of this spec
       StartText     text          text for start of element

       <b>Action:</b> <u>spec-id</u>
              Use the actions of the spec identified by the <b>SpecID</b> with matching identifier <u>spec-id</u>.

       <b>EndText:</b> <u>text</u>
              This specifies text to be output when the end tag is processed.

       <b>Ignore:</b> <u>key</u>
              This specifies that the data or children for this element are to be ignored.  Set <u>key</u>  to  <b>all</b>  to
              ignore  the  element  (data  and  child  elements), to <b>data</b> to ignore the immediate character data
              content (child elements are still descended into),  and  to  <b>children</b>  to  process  the  immediate
              character  data  content  but  not descended into child elements.  Other actions specified in this
              transpec are still performed, however.

       <b>Increment:</b> <u>name</u>
              This is used to increment a variable whose value is a number.  If the variable is not a number, no
              action will be taken.  The variable must have  been  previously  defined.   This  action  is  done
              immediately before <b>EndText</b>.  There may be more than one of these lines for each transpec.

       <b>Message:</b> <u>text</u>
              This  specifies  a  string  to  be  printed  to  the  standard  error when the matching element is
              processed.  It is intended for informing the user of the progress of the translation.  It is  also
              used  for  validation  of  instances  (see  the <b>-v</b> flag of <b><a href="../man1/instant.1.html">instant</a></b>(1)); a spec would be written to
              recognize a construct that is not allowed.  This  action  is  done  immediately  after  <b>StartText</b>.
              Messages are also useful for debugging spec files; one is able to easily tell when a matching spec
              is  processed, without looking at the actual output of the translation.  Note that the spec writer
              is responsible for putting newlines (<b>\n</b>) in the message text.

       <b>Replace:</b> <u>text</u>
              This specifies text to replace the current subtree with.  This  is  equivalent  to  <b>StartText</b>  and
              <b>Ignore</b>.

       <b>Quit:</b> <u>text</u>
              This  specifies  text  to be printed to the standard error.  The program then terminates with exit
              status 1.  This is intended for bailing out when an undesirable instance is encountered  (such  as
              when  it  is  known  that  the formatting application can never handle a class of components, like
              tables).

       <b>Set:</b> <u>name</u> <u>value</u>
              This is used to set a variable whose name is <u>name</u> and value is <u>value</u>.  Names that would  be  valid
              for  GIs in the document instance are valid for variable names.  <u>value</u> is the rest of the line and
              may be any string.   This action is done immediately before <b>EndText</b>.  There may be more  than  one
              of these lines for each transpec.  See the discussion on variables below.

       <b>SpecID:</b> <u>spec-id</u>
              This  names  the spec with the number <u>spec-id</u>. Other specs may refer to this one by this number by
              an <b>Action</b> field or an <b>_action</b> special variable.  This is used for cases  where  several  specs  to
              perform the exact same action.

       <b>StartText:</b> <u>text</u>
              This specifies text to be output when the start tag is processed.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Fields</b>
       These  fields  may appear anywhere.  The action occurs when the translation spec file is read, before any
       elements are translated.  Theses are independent of any element processing.

       <b>Var:</b> <u>name</u> <u>value</u>
              This is used to define a variable whose name is <u>name</u> and value is <u>value</u>.  It is  similar  to  <b>Set</b>,
              but it may occur anywhere in the file and takes effect when the spec file is read.

   <b>Text</b> <b>Strings</b>
       The  <u>text</u>  referred  to  in  the  <b>StartText</b>,  <b>EndText</b>,  <b>Replace</b>,  and <b>Message</b> actions is more than simple
       character strings.  Special sequences allow more complex output.

       One type of special sequence is for C-style string processing.  Most special characters are escaped  with
       a  \  (backslash). Like in C or shell programs, to print a \ (backslash), you must escape it with another
       backslash. These special character strings are:

       <b>\n</b> <b>(backslash-n)</b>
              This specifies that a newline character is to be printed to the output stream.

       <b>\r</b> <b>(backslash-r)</b>
              This specifies that a carriage return character is to be printed to the output stream.

       <b>\t</b> <b>(backslash-t)</b>
              This specifies that a tab character is to be printed to the output stream.

       <b>\s</b> <b>(backslash-s)</b>
              This specifies that a space is to be printed to the output stream.  This is useful for the end  of
              a transpec line, where it can be difficult to tell if a blank is present at the end.

       <b>\007</b> <b>(backslash-007)</b>
              This  specifies that the character whose octal value is 007 is to be printed to the output stream.
              This works for any octal character value.

       <b>^</b> <b>(caret)</b>
              This specifies the that position in the string will be at the  start  of  a  line  in  the  output
              stream.

       If  the  first token of the text string is <b>#include</b>, then the second token is taken to be a file name and
       that file is included.  If the file is not found, the library directory, as mentioned above, is searched.
       If the text string starts with a <b>!</b> (exclamation point), the rest of the line is taken to be a command and
       the output of that command is inserted.

       An element's attributes may also be used in the text of  output  fields.   To  use  an  attribute  value,
       precede its name with a <b>${</b> (dollar sign-left curly bracket) and follow it with a <b>}</b> (right curly bracket).
       (This  style  is  followed by the Bourne shell.)  For example, <b>${TYPE}</b>.  If the attribute is not set (not
       IMPLIED), nothing will be printed to the output stream.  To specify a value to use if  the  attribute  is
       not  set,  place the value after the attribute name, separated by a space.  To return the attribute value
       in lower-case, add a colon followed by lower-case l (<b>${TYPE:l}</b>.

</pre><h4><b>Variables</b></h4><pre>
       Variables in <b>instant</b> are similar to those in many other string-oriented programming languages, such as <b>sh</b>
       and <b>awk</b>.  They are set by: <b>Var:</b> <u>name</u> <u>value</u> and <b>Set:</b> <u>name</u> <u>value</u>.  Values may  be  set  and  reset  to  any
       string.  In a <b>Var</b> line, if the value begins with a <b>!</b>, then the rest of the line is executed as a command,
       and its output is taken as the <u>value</u>.

       A  reference  to  the  value  of  a  variable  follows  the same syntax as a reference to the value of an
       attribute:  <b>${</b><u>name</u><b>}</b>.  If that variable has not been defined, a null value will be  returned.   A  default
       value can be returned instead of null for an undefined variable by using the form:  <b>${</b><u>name</u> <u>default</u><b>}</b>.

       Variables may be used as attributes are, that is in any of the text strings mentioned above.  In fact, if
       an attribute name is referred to and it is not set for a given element, <b>instant</b> looks for a variable with
       the  same  name.   This  way global defaults can be set.  If you want to be sure that you are accessing a
       local variable value, not an attribute value, you can use lower or mixed case names.  Attribute names, as
       passed by <b>onsgmls</b>, are in upper case.

       Any number of <b>Var</b> actions may appear in the spec file.  These set the values of the variables before  any
       translation takes place.  The <b>Set</b> actions within transpecs are performed when that spec is processed when
       an element matches the given criteria.

   <b>Preset</b> <b>Variables</b>
       Several  variables  are  preset  by <b>instant</b> upon start of the program.  Their values may be overridden in
       transpec files or on the command line.

       <b>date</b>   This is the date and time that the program started. The format is: Tue 10 Aug 1993, 16:52.

       <b>host</b>   This is the name of the host where the program is run.  It is what is returned by the  <b>gethostname</b>
              library call.

       <b>transpec</b>
              This is the translation spec filename.

       <b>user</b>   This is the login name of the user running the program.

   <b>Special</b> <b>Variables</b>
       There  is  a  collection of special variables called <u>special</u> <u>variables</u>.  These are identified by starting
       the names with a <b>_</b> (underscore).  This is a summary of the special variables.  A complete  discussion  of
       each  special  variable follows.  <b>spec-id</b> refers to a number specified in a <b>SpecID</b> field.  When used in a
       special variable, it means to perform the action in that translation spec.

       Note that when a <u>spec-id</u> is given in a special variable, the default is to perform the  translation  spec
       named  by  the  <u>spec-id</u> ignoring of any criteria statements found there.  For most special variables that
       use a <u>spec-id</u>, postpending a "<b>t</b>" to the <u>spec-id</u> (with no spaces between  them,  eg,  "<b>${_followrel</b>  <b>child</b>
       <b>TITLE</b>  <b>15t}</b>"),  will cause the criteria statements in the named translation spec to evaluate successfully
       before that translation spec will be processed.

       <b>Variable</b> <b>Usage</b>                       <b>Description</b>
       <b>_action</b> <u>spec-id</u>                      do spec with id spec-id

       <b>_followrel</b> <u>rel</u> <u>gi</u> <u>spec-id</u>            do spec-id on rel if it matches
       <b>_gi</b> [<b>M|L|U</b>]                          return GI name; M, L, U case
       <b>_id</b> <u>id</u> <u>[spec-id</u>]                     find element with ID and use spec-id

       <b>_nchild</b> [<u>gi</u>]                         number of child elements [named <u>attname</u>]
       <b>_osftable</b> <u>format</u> [<u>flag</u>]              print table format specification

       <b>_pfind</b> <u>args</u> <u>...</u>                      same as <b>_find</b>, but start at parent
       <b>_relation</b> <u>rel</u> <u>gi</u> <u>spec-id</u> [<u>spec-id</u>]   do spec-id if relation matches
       <b>_set</b> <u>var</u> <u>value</u>                       set variable to value
       <b>_!</b><u>command</u>                            command to run

       <b>_action</b> <u>spec-id</u>
              Use the actions of the spec identified by the  <b>SpecID</b>  with  matching  identifier  <u>spec-id</u>.   This
              behaves similarly to the <b>Action</b> action, but is in addition to the present translation spec.

       <b>_allatts</b>
              Print  all  attribute  name-value pairs of the current element to the output stream.  The name and
              value are separated by a <b>=</b> (equals sign), and the value is surrounded  by  quotes.   This  can  be
              useful for creating a normalized version of the instance.

       <b>_attval</b> <u>attname</u> [<u>value</u>] <u>spec-id</u>
              If  the  current element has an attribute named <u>attname</u>, optionally whose value matches <u>value</u>, use
              the actions of the transpec identified by <u>spec-id</u>.

       <b>_chasetogi</b> <u>gi</u> <u>spec-id</u>
              Follow IDREF attributes until if finds an element whose GI is <u>gi</u> or which has a child element with
              that GI.  It will apply the transpec <u>spec-id</u> to that element.  By  default,  <b>instant</b>  assumes  the
              attributes named <b>LINKEND</b>, <b>LINKENDS</b>, and <b>IDREF</b> are of type IDREF or IDREFS.  (This corresponds with
              the OSF DTDs.)  You can change this by setting the variable <b>link_atts</b> to a space-separated list of
              attribute names.

       <b>_eachatt</b> <u>att</u> <u>spec-id</u> [<u>spec-id2</u>]
              The  transpec  named  by <u>spec-id</u> is invoked once per each word found in the value of the attribute
              <u>att</u>.  Inside the target transpec, the current word being processed is available  in  the  variable
              named <b>each_A</b> (<b>${each_A}</b>).  If <u>spec-id2</u> is specified, it will use <u>spec-id</u> for the first word in the
              attribute and <u>spec-id2</u> for the others.

       <b>_eachcon</b> <u>spec-id</u> [<u>spec-id2</u>]
              The  transpec  named  by <u>spec-id</u> is invoked once per each word found in the content of the current
              element.  Inside the target transpec, the  current  word  being  processed  is  available  in  the
              variable  named  <b>each_C</b>  (<b>${each_C}</b>).  If <u>spec-id2</u> is specified, it will use <u>spec-id</u> for the first
              word in the content and <u>spec-id2</u> for the others.

       <b>_env</b> <u>env-variable</u>
              Print the value of the environment variable <u>env-variable</u> to the output stream.

       <b>_filename</b>
              Print the filename of the notation associated with this element, if any.  This is used to get  the
              filename  of  an  external  notation  entity reference.  For example, to print the filename in the
              latex macro from the epsf macro package, use \\epsfboxi{${_filename}}.

       <b>_find</b> [<b>top</b>] <u>relationship</u> <u>args</u> <u>...</u> <u>spec-id</u>
              Descend the document hierarchy finding elements that match one of several criteria.  When  one  is
              found,  the  action  specified by <u>spec-id</u> is performed.  If <b>top</b> is specified, the search starts at
              the top of the document hierarchy, rather than at the current element.  The  possible  values  for
              <u>relationship</u>  are <b>gi</b>, <b>gi-parent</b>, <b>parent</b>, and <b>attr</b>, and take different arguments.  Explanations may
              be best done by example: <b>_find</b> <b>gi</b> <b>CHAPTER</b> <b>123</b> means to find elements  whose  GI  is  CHAPTER,  and
              perform action 123; <b>_find</b> <b>gi-parent</b> <b>TITLE</b> <b>CHAPTER</b> <b>124</b> means to find elements whose GI is TITLE and
              whose  parent  is  CHAPTER,  and  perform action 124; <b>_find</b> <b>parent</b> <b>BODY</b> <b>125</b> means to find elements
              whose parent's GI is BODY, and perform action 125; <b>_find</b> <b>attr</b> <b>TYPE</b> <b>UGLY</b> <b>125</b> means to find elements
              whose attribute named TYPE is set to UGLY, and perform action 126.

       <b>_followlink</b> [<u>attname</u>] <u>spec-id</u>
              When processing an element, <b>instant</b> will follow the IDREF attributes  until  an  element  with  no
              IDREF  attributes is found.  It will then apply the transpec specified by <u>spec-id</u> to that element.
              If specified, it will follow the link pointed to by <u>attname</u>.   By  default,  <b>instant</b>  assumes  the
              attributes named <b>LINKEND</b> and <b>LINKENDS</b> are if type IDREF or IDREFS.  You can change this by setting
              the variable <b>link_atts</b> to a space-separated list of attribute names.

       <b>_followrel</b> <u>relationship</u> <u>gi</u> <u>spec-id</u>
              If  the  <u>gi</u> has the specified <u>relationship</u> to the current element, perform the action specified by
              <u>spec-id</u> on the related element.  See the discussion of the criteria field <b>Relation</b> for  acceptable
              relationship names.

       <b>_gi</b> [<b>M|L|U</b>]
              Print  the  name of the current GI to the output stream.  If specified, <b>M</b>, <b>L</b>, or <b>U</b> will ensure the
              GI name is printed in mixed, lower, or upper case, respectively.

       <b>_id</b> <u>id</u> [<u>spec-id</u>]
              Find the element with <u>id</u> and use <u>spec-id</u>, if set.  If not set, use the  spec  for  that  element's
              context.

       <b>_include</b> <u>filename</u>
              Insert the file <u>filename</u> into the output stream.

       <b>_infile</b> [<b>line</b>]
              Print  the  name  of the sgml instance file to the output stream. If <b>line</b> is specified, also print
              the line number.  This depends on <b>onsgmls</b> being called with the <b>-l</b> option.

       <b>_insertnode</b> <b>S</b>|<b>E</b> <u>spec-id</u>
              Do <u>spec-id</u> when the current element is  traversed  at  a  later  pass.   This  can  be  considered
              inserting  a  node,  without content, into the hierarchy.  This is only useful if done to elements
              <u>before</u> they are  processed.   Typically  <b>_chasetogi</b>  or  <b>_followlink</b>  is  specified  early  in  an
              instance's  processing,  so  that when the elements found by one of these actions are processed in
              their turn, the added actions are performed.  <b>_insertnode</b> would be specified as the  action  of  a
              <u>spec-id</u> pointed to in a <b>_chasetogi</b> or <b>_followlink</b> usage.

       <b>_location</b>
              The  location  of the current element is printed to the output stream in several ways: the path to
              the element (see <b>_path</b>), a position hint, which is the nearest title, the line number, if the ESIS
              (output from <b>onsgmls</b>) contains line numbers, and the ID of the element, if it has  one.   This  is
              especially useful when using the <b>Message</b> action to validate an instance.

       <b>_namelist</b> <u>spec-id</u> [<u>spec-id2</u>]
              This  assumes  that  the content of the current element is a namelist (a list of element IDs), and
              applies the action based on <u>spec-id</u> for each element pointed to.  If  <u>spec-id2</u>  is  specified,  it
              will use <u>spec-id</u> for the first ID in the namelist and <u>spec-id2</u> for the others.

       <b>_nchild</b> [<u>gi</u>]
              Print the number of child elements of the element to the output stream.  If <u>gi</u> is specified, print
              the number of child element with that name.

       <b>_osftable</b> <b>tex</b>|<b>tbl</b>|<b>check</b> [<u>flag</u>]
              Print table markup into the output stream.  The format depends on whether <b>tex</b> or <b>tbl</b> is specified.
              The <u>flag</u> may be one of <b>cellstart</b>, <b>cellend</b>, <b>rowstart</b>, <b>rowend</b>, <b>top</b>, or <b>bottom</b>.  The value determines
              what  markup  or  text  will  be generated.  If <b>cellstart</b> is specified, the correct markup for the
              beginning of a cell is output.  If <b>top</b>, <b>bottom</b>, or <b>rowend</b> are specified, the  correct  markup  for
              the  end  of the appropriate position is printed to the output stream.  If <b>check</b> is specified, the
              attributes and child elements are checked for errors and consistency.

       <b>_path</b>  Print the path to current GI to the output stream.  A path is each element, going  down  the  tree
              from  the  topmost  element.   A  number  in parentheses after each element name shows which child
              element the next one is in the order of children for that element.  Ordering  starts  at  0.   For
              example:  <a href="../man3/OSF-BOOK.3.html">OSF-BOOK</a>(3) <a href="../man0/BODY.0.html">BODY</a>(0) <a href="../man4/CHAPTER.4.html">CHAPTER</a>(4) SECTION.  This says the path is <b>&lt;OSF-BOOK&gt;</b>'s third child,
              <b>&lt;BODY&gt;</b>'s zeroth, and <b>&lt;CHAPTER&gt;</b>'s fourth, which is named <b>&lt;SECTION&gt;</b>.

       <b>_pattr</b> <u>name</u>
              Print the value of parent's attribute whose name is <u>name</u> to the output stream.

       <b>_pfind</b> <u>rel</u> <u>gi</u> <u>spec-id</u>
              This is exactly the same as <b>_find</b> except that the search starts at the current element's parent.

       <b>_relation</b> <u>relationship</u> <u>gi</u> <u>spec-id</u> [<u>spec-id2</u>]
              If the <u>gi</u> has the specified <u>relationship</u> to the current element, perform the action  specified  by
              <u>spec-id</u> on the current element.  If the relationship test fails and <u>spec-id2</u> is specified, perform
              that action.  See the discussion of the criteria field <b>Relation</b> for acceptable relationship names.

       <b>_set</b> <u>varname</u> <u>value</u>
              Set the value of the variable <u>varname</u> to <u>value</u>.

       <b>_isset</b> <u>varname</u> [<u>value</u>] <u>spec-id</u>
              If  the value of the variable <u>varname</u> is set to <u>value</u>, then perform action referred to by <u>spec-id</u>.
              If <u>value</u> is not specified, action will be performed if <u>varname</u> is set to any value.

       <b>_!</b> <u>command</u>
              Run the command <u>command</u>, directing its standard output into the output stream.

   <b>Immediate</b> <b>Variables</b>
       <u>Immediate</u> <u>variables</u> are like special variables, except that  they  are  expanded  when  the  transpec  is
       originally  processed  (special  variables  are  processed  later,  near  when  the final output is being
       generated).  The general syntax of immediate variables is <b>${+</b><u>immediate_variable</u> <u>...</u><b>}</b>.

       There is currently only one immediate variable defined:

       <b>+content</b>
              This special variable is replaced by the data content of the current element.

</pre><h4><b>Examples</b></h4><pre>
       The following will output the given string for elements whose generic identifier is  <b>P</b>  (for  paragraph).
       At  the  start  of processing this element, the program ensures that the output starts on a new line, the
       <b>troff</b> macro <b>&lt;.P&gt;</b> is output, then a newline.  At the end of this element processing, the  program  ensures
       that the output starts on a new line.
       GI:             P
       StartText:      ^.P^
       EndText:        ^
       -

       The  following  will  output  the  given string for elements whose generic identifier is <b>CMD-ARGUMENT</b> and
       which have an attribute <b>PRESENCE</b> set to the value <b>OPTIONAL</b>.
       GI:             CMD-ARGUMENT
       AttValue:       PRESENCE OPTIONAL
       StartText:      $\\[
       EndText:        $\\]

       The following prints the section number, title, and page number of  the  target  of  a  cross  reference.
       Assume the cross reference points to a section element, which contains a title element.  The criteria for
       this  spec  to match is that the attribute <b>OSFROLE</b> is set to the value <b>getfull</b>.  The action is to replace
       the content of the <b>&lt;XREF&gt;</b> element with the given string.  When processing the string, <b>instant</b> will follow
       the IDREF attributes of <b>&lt;XREF&gt;</b> until an element with no IDREF attributes is found. It will then apply the
       transpec numbered <b>87</b> to that element, which will print the name of the GI in mixed case into  the  output
       stream.  It will then print the LaTeX reference instruction with the value of the <b>LINKEND</b> attribute as an
       argument.   (This  will become the section number after processing by LaTeX.)  It will then follow IDREFs
       until if finds an element whose GI is <b>TITLE</b> or which has a child element with that GI.  It will apply the
       transpec numbered <b>1</b> to that element, which copies the title  into  the  output  stream  where  the  cross
       reference  occurs.   Finally, it will print the word <b>page</b> followed by the LaTeX instruction to obtain the
       page number of a reference.
       GI:             XREF
       AttValue:       OSFROLE getfull
       Replace:        ${_followlink 87} \\ref{${LINKEND}},\s
                       {\\bf ${_chasetogi TITLE 1}}, page \\pageref{${LINKEND}}
       -
       # Print GI name, in mixed case
       GI:             _pr_gi_name
       SpecID:         87
       Ignore:         1
       EndText:        ${_gi M}
       -
       GI:             _pass-text
