</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       notmuch-hooks - hooks for notmuch

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       &lt;hook_dir&gt;/{pre-new, post-new, post-insert}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Hooks  are  scripts  (or arbitrary executables or symlinks to such) that notmuch invokes before and after
       certain actions. These scripts reside in a directory defined as described in  <u>notmuch-config</u>.  They  must
       have executable permissions.

       The currently available hooks are described below.

       <b>pre-new</b>
              This hook is invoked by the <u>notmuch-new</u> command before scanning or importing new messages into the
              database.  If this hook exits with a non-zero status, notmuch will abort further processing of the
              <u>notmuch-new</u> command.

              Typically this hook is used for fetching or delivering new mail to be imported into the database.

       <b>post-new</b>
              This hook is invoked by the <u>notmuch-new</u> command after any new messages have been imported into the
              database and initial tags have been applied. The hook will not be  run  if  there  have  been  any
              errors during the scan or import.

              Typically this hook is used to perform additional query-based tagging on the imported messages.

       <b>post-insert</b>
              This  hook is invoked by the <u>notmuch-insert</u> command after the message has been delivered, added to
              the database, and initial tags have been applied. The hook will not be run if there have been  any
              errors  during the message delivery; what is regarded as successful delivery depends on the <b>--keep</b>
              option.

              Typically this hook is used to perform additional query-based tagging on the delivered messages.
