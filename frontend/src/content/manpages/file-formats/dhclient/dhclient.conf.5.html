       dhclient.conf - DHCP client configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  dhclient.conf  file contains configuration information for <u>dhclient,</u> the Internet Systems Consortium
       DHCP Client.

       The dhclient.conf file is a free-form ASCII text file.  It is  parsed  by  the  recursive-descent  parser
       built  into dhclient.  The file may contain extra tabs and newlines for formatting purposes.  Keywords in
       the file are case-insensitive.  Comments may be placed anywhere within the file (except  within  quotes).
       Comments begin with the # character and end at the end of the line.

       The  dhclient.conf  file  can be used to configure the behaviour of the client in a wide variety of ways:
       protocol timing, information requested from the server, information required of the server,  defaults  to
       use  if  the  server  does  not  provide  certain  information, values with which to override information
       provided by the server, or values to prepend or append  to  information  provided  by  the  server.   The
       configuration  file  can  also  be  preinitialized with addresses to use on networks that don't have DHCP
       servers.

</pre><h4><b>PROTOCOL</b> <b>TIMING</b></h4><pre>
       The timing behaviour of the client need not be configured by the user.  If  no  timing  configuration  is
       provided by the user, a fairly reasonable timing behaviour will be used by default - one which results in
       fairly timely updates without placing an inordinate load on the server.

       If  required  the  following  statements can be used to adjust the timing behaviour of the DHCPv4 client.
       The DHCPv6 protocol provides values to use and they are not currently configurable.

       <u>The</u> <b>timeout</b> <u>statement</u>

        <b>timeout</b> <u>time</u><b>;</b>

       The <u>timeout</u> statement determines the amount of time that must pass  between  the  time  that  the  client
       begins  to  try  to  determine its address and the time that it decides that it's not going to be able to
       contact a server.  By default, this timeout is 300 seconds.  After the timeout has passed, if  there  are
       any  static  leases defined in the configuration file, or any leases remaining in the lease database that
       have not yet expired, the client will loop through these leases attempting to validate them,  and  if  it
       finds  one  that  appears  to  be  valid, it will use that lease's address.  If there are no valid static
       leases or unexpired leases in the lease database, the client will restart the protocol after the  defined
       retry interval.

       <u>The</u> <b>retry</b> <u>statement</u>

        <b>retry</b> <u>time</u><b>;</b>

       The  <u>retry</u>  statement determines the time that must pass after the client has determined that there is no
       DHCP server present before it tries again to contact a DHCP server.  By default, this is five minutes.

       <u>The</u> <b>select-timeout</b> <u>statement</u>

        <b>select-timeout</b> <u>time</u><b>;</b>

       It is possible (some might say desirable) for there to be more than one DHCP  server  serving  any  given
       network.   In  this case, it is possible that a client may be sent more than one offer in response to its
       initial lease discovery message.  It may be that one of these offers is preferable to  the  other  (e.g.,
       one offer may have the address the client previously used, and the other may not).

       The <u>select-timeout</u> is the time after the client sends its first lease discovery request at which it stops
       waiting  for  offers  from  servers, assuming that it has received at least one such offer.  If no offers
       have been received by the time the <u>select-timeout</u> has expired, the client will  accept  the  first  offer
       that arrives.

       By default, the select-timeout is zero seconds - that is, the client will take the first offer it sees.

       <u>The</u> <b>reboot</b> <u>statement</u>

        <b>reboot</b> <u>time</u><b>;</b>

       When  the  client  is restarted, it first tries to reacquire the last address it had.  This is called the
       INIT-REBOOT state.  If it is still attached to the same network it was attached to when it last ran, this
       is the quickest way to get started.  The <u>reboot</u> statement sets the time that must elapse after the client
       first tries to reacquire its old address before it gives up and tries to  discover  a  new  address.   By
       default, the reboot timeout is ten seconds.

       <u>The</u> <b>backoff-cutoff</b> <u>statement</u>

        <b>backoff-cutoff</b> <u>time</u><b>;</b>

       The  client  uses  an  exponential backoff algorithm with some randomness, so that if many clients try to
       configure themselves at the same time, they will not make their requests in lockstep.  The <u>backoff-cutoff</u>
       statement determines the maximum amount of time that the client is allowed to back off, the actual  value
       will  be  evaluated  randomly  between  1/2  to  1  1/2 times the <u>time</u> specified.  It defaults to fifteen
       seconds.

       <u>The</u> <b>initial-interval</b> <u>statement</u>

        <b>initial-interval</b> <u>time</u><b>;</b>

       The <u>initial-interval</u> statement sets the amount of time between the first attempt to reach  a  server  and
       the  second  attempt  to  reach  a server.  Each time a message is sent, the interval between messages is
       incremented by twice the current interval multiplied by a random number between zero and one.  If  it  is
       greater than the backoff-cutoff amount, it is set to that amount.  It defaults to ten seconds.

       <u>The</u> <u>initial-delay</u> <u>statement</u>

        <b>initial-delay</b> <u>time</u><b>;</b>

       <u>initial-delay</u>  parameter  sets  the  maximum  time  client  can  wait after start before commencing first
       transmission.  According to RFC2131 Section 4.4.1, client should wait a random time between  startup  and
       the  actual  first  transmission.  Previous  versions of ISC DHCP client used to wait random time up to 5
       seconds, but that was unwanted due to impact on startup time. As such,  new  versions  have  the  default
       initial delay set to 0. To restore old behavior, please set initial-delay to 5.

</pre><h4><b>DHCPv6</b> <b>LEASE</b> <b>SELECTION</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  DHCPv6  protocol  the  client  will wait a small amount of time to allow ADVERTISE messages from
       multiple servers to arrive.  It will then need to choose from all of the messages that may  have  arrived
       before proceeding to making a request of the selected server.

       The  first  selection  criteria  is the set of options and addresses in the message.  Messages that don't
       include an option specified as required will be given a score of 0 and not used.  If  the  <u>-R</u>  option  is
       given  on  the command line then messages that don't include the correct number of bindings (IA-NA, IA-TA
       or IA-PD) will be discarded.

       The next criteria is the preference value from the message.  With the highest preference value being used
       even if leases with better addresses or options are available.

       Finally the lease is scored and the lease with the highest score is selected.  A lease's score  is  based
       on the number of bindings, number of addresses and number of options it contains:
            bindings * X + addresses * Y + options
       By  default X = 10000 and Y = 100, this will cause the client to select a lease with more bindings over a
       lease with less bindings but more addresses.  The weightings were changed as  part  of  implementing  RFC
       7550.   Previously they were X = 50 and Y = 100 meaning more addresses were preferred over more bindings.
       If you wish to continue using the old style you may  do  so  by  editing  the  file  includes/site.h  and
       uncommenting the define for USE_ORIGINAL_CLIENT_LEASE_WEIGHTS.

</pre><h4><b>LEASE</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>REQUESTS</b></h4><pre>
       The DHCP protocol allows the client to request that the server send it specific information, and not send
       it  other  information  that it is not prepared to accept.  The protocol also allows the client to reject
       offers from servers if they don't contain information the client needs, or if the information provided is
       not satisfactory.

       There is a variety of data contained in offers that DHCP servers send to DHCP clients.  The data that can
       be specifically requested is what are called <u>DHCP</u> <u>Options</u>.  DHCP Options are defined in
        <b><a href="../man5/dhcp-options.5.html">dhcp-options</a>(5)</b>.

       <u>The</u> <b>request</b> <u>statement</u>

        <b>[</b> <b>also</b> <b>]</b> <b>request</b> <b>[</b> <b>[</b> <u>option-space</u> . ] <u>option</u> ] [<b>,</b> <u>...</u> <u>]</u><b>;</b>

       The request statement causes the client to request that any server responding  to  the  client  send  the
       client  its  values  for the specified options.  Only the option names should be specified in the request
       statement - not option parameters.  By default, the DHCPv4 client requests  the  subnet-mask,  broadcast-
       address,  time-offset,  routers,  domain-name, domain-name-servers and host-name options while the DHCPv6
       client requests the dhcp6 name-servers and domain-search options.  Note that if  you  enter  a  ´request´
       statement, you over-ride these defaults and these options will not be requested.

       In  some  cases,  it may be desirable to send no parameter request list at all.  To do this, simply write
       the request statement but specify no parameters:

            request;

       In most cases, it is desirable to simply add one option to the request list which is of interest  to  the
       client in question.  In this case, it is best to ´also request´ the additional options:

            also request domain-search, dhcp6.sip-servers-addresses;

       <u>The</u> <b>require</b> <u>statement</u>

        <b>[</b> <b>also</b> <b>]</b> <b>require</b> <b>[</b> <b>[</b> <u>option-space</u> . ] <u>option</u> ] [<b>,</b> <u>...</u> <u>]</u><b>;</b>

       The  require statement lists options that must be sent in order for an offer to be accepted.  Offers that
       do not contain all the listed options will be ignored.  There is no default require list.

            require name-servers;

            interface eth0 {
                 also require domain-search;
            }

       <u>The</u> <b>send</b> <u>statement</u>

        <b>send</b> <b>[</b> <u>option</u> <u>declaration</u> ] <b>;</b>

       The send statement causes the client to send the specified option to the server with the specified value.
       This is a full option declaration as described in <b><a href="../man5/dhcp-options.5.html">dhcp-options</a>(5)</b>.  Options that are always sent  in  the
       DHCP  protocol  should  not be specified here, except that the client can specify a requested <b>dhcp-lease-</b>
       <b>time</b> option other than the default requested lease time, which is two hours.  The other obvious  use  for
       this  statement  is  to  send  information to the server that will allow it to differentiate between this
       client and other clients or kinds of clients.

</pre><h4><b>DYNAMIC</b> <b>DNS</b></h4><pre>
       The client now has some very limited support for doing DNS updates when a lease  is  acquired.   This  is
       prototypical,  and  probably  doesn't do what you want.  It also only works if you happen to have control
       over your DNS server, which isn't very likely.

       Note that everything in this section is true whether you are using DHCPv4  or  DHCPv6.   The  exact  same
       syntax is used for both.

       To  make  it  work,  you  have  to  declare  a  key and zone as in the DHCP server (see <b><a href="../man5/dhcpd.conf.5.html">dhcpd.conf</a></b>(5) for
       details).  You also need to configure the <u>fqdn</u> option on the client, as follows:

         send fqdn.fqdn "grosse.example.com.";
         send fqdn.encoded on;
         send fqdn.server-update off;
         also request fqdn, dhcp6.fqdn;

       The <u>fqdn.fqdn</u> option <b>MUST</b> be a fully-qualified domain name.  You <b>MUST</b> define a  zone  statement  for  the
       zone  to  be  updated.   The  <u>fqdn.encoded</u>  option may need to be set to <u>on</u> or <u>off</u>, depending on the DHCP
       server you are using.

       <u>The</u> <b>do-forward-updates</b> <u>statement</u>

        <b>do-forward-updates</b> <b>[</b> <u>flag</u> ] <b>;</b>

       If you want to do DNS updates in the DHCP client script (see <b><a href="../man8/dhclient-script.8.html">dhclient-script</a>(8)</b>) rather than  having  the
       DHCP  client  do the update directly (for example, if you want to use <a href="../man0/SIG.0.html">SIG</a>(0) authentication, which is not
       supported directly by the DHCP client, you can instruct the client not to do the  update  using  the  <b>do-</b>
       <b>forward-updates</b>  statement.   <u>Flag</u> should be <b>true</b> if you want the DHCP client to do the update, and <b>false</b>
       if you don't want the DHCP client to do the update.  By default, the DHCP client will do the DNS update.

</pre><h4><b>OPTION</b> <b>MODIFIERS</b></h4><pre>
       In some cases, a client may receive option data from the server which is not really appropriate for  that
       client,  or  may  not receive information that it needs, and for which a useful default value exists.  It
       may also receive information which is useful, but which needs to be supplemented with local  information.
       To handle these needs, several option modifiers are available.

       <u>The</u> <b>default</b> <u>statement</u>

        <b>default</b> <b>[</b> <u>option</u> <u>declaration</u> ] <b>;</b>

       If  for some option the client should use the value supplied by the server, but needs to use some default
       value if no value was supplied by the server, these values can be defined in the <b>default</b> statement.

       <u>The</u> <b>supersede</b> <u>statement</u>

        <b>supersede</b> <b>[</b> <u>option</u> <u>declaration</u> ] <b>;</b>

       If for some option the client should always use a locally-configured value or values rather than whatever
       is supplied by the server, these values can be defined in the <b>supersede</b> statement.

       <u>The</u> <b>prepend</b> <u>statement</u>

        <b>prepend</b> <b>[</b> <u>option</u> <u>declaration</u> ] <b>;</b>

       If for some set of options the client should use a value you supply, and then use the values supplied  by
       the server, if any, these values can be defined in the <b>prepend</b> statement.  The <b>prepend</b> statement can only
       be  used  for options which allow more than one value to be given.  This restriction is not enforced - if
       you ignore it, the behaviour will be unpredictable.

       <u>The</u> <b>append</b> <u>statement</u>

        <b>append</b> <b>[</b> <u>option</u> <u>declaration</u> ] <b>;</b>

       If for some set of options the client should first use the values supplied by the  server,  if  any,  and
       then  use  values  you supply, these values can be defined in the <b>append</b> statement.  The <b>append</b> statement
       can only be used for options which allow more than one value  to  be  given.   This  restriction  is  not
       enforced - if you ignore it, the behaviour will be unpredictable.

</pre><h4><b>LEASE</b> <b>DECLARATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>The</u> <b>lease</b> <u>declaration</u>

        <b>lease</b> <b>{</b> <u>lease-declaration</u> [ ... <u>lease-declaration</u> <u>]</u> <b>}</b>

       The  DHCP  client  may  decide  after  some  period of time (see <b>PROTOCOL</b> <b>TIMING</b>) that it is not going to
       succeed in contacting a server.  At that time, it consults its own database of old leases and tests  each
       one  that  has  not  yet timed out by pinging the listed router for that lease to see if that lease could
       work.  It is possible to define one or more <u>fixed</u> leases in the client configuration  file  for  networks
       where  there  is  no  DHCP  or  BOOTP  service,  so that the client can still automatically configure its
       address.  This is done with the <b>lease</b> statement.

       NOTE: the lease statement is also used in the dhclient.leases file in order to record  leases  that  have
       been  received from DHCP servers.  Some of the syntax for leases as described below is only needed in the
       dhclient.leases file.  Such syntax is documented here for completeness.

       A lease statement consists of the lease keyword, followed by a left curly brace, followed by one or  more
       lease  declaration  statements,  followed  by  a right curly brace.  The following lease declarations are
       possible:

        <b>bootp;</b>

       The <b>bootp</b> statement is used to indicate that the lease was acquired using the BOOTP protocol rather  than
       the  DHCP  protocol.  It is never necessary to specify this in the client configuration file.  The client
       uses this syntax in its lease database file.

        <b>interface</b> <b>"</b><u>string</u><b>";</b>

       The <b>interface</b> lease statement is used to indicate the interface on which the lease  is  valid.   If  set,
       this lease will only be tried on a particular interface.  When the client receives a lease from a server,
       it  always  records  the  interface  number  on  which  it received that lease.  If predefined leases are
       specified in the dhclient.conf file, the interface  should  also  be  specified,  although  this  is  not
       required.

        <b>fixed-address</b> <u>ip-address</u><b>;</b>

       The  <b>fixed-address</b>  statement  is used to set the ip address of a particular lease.  This is required for
       all lease statements.  The IP address must be specified as a dotted quad (e.g., 12.34.56.78).

        <b>filename</b> <b>"</b><u>string</u><b>";</b>

       The <b>filename</b> statement specifies the name of the boot filename to use.  This is not used by the  standard
       client configuration script, but is included for completeness.

        <b>server-name</b> <b>"</b><u>string</u><b>";</b>

       The  <b>server-name</b>  statement  specifies the name of the boot server name to use.  This is also not used by
       the standard client configuration script.

        <b>option</b> <u>option-declaration</u><b>;</b>

       The <b>option</b> statement is used to specify the value of an option supplied by the server, or, in the case of
       predefined leases declared in dhclient.conf, the value that the  user  wishes  the  client  configuration
       script to use if the predefined lease is used.

        <b>script</b> <b>"</b><u>script-name</u><b>";</b>

       The  <b>script</b>  statement  is  used  to  specify the pathname of the dhcp client configuration script.  This
       script is used by the dhcp client to set each interface's initial configuration prior  to  requesting  an
       address,  to  test  the  address once it has been offered, and to set the interface's final configuration
       once a lease has been acquired.  If no lease is acquired, the script is used to test  predefined  leases,
       if  any,  and  also called once if no valid lease can be identified.  For more information, see <b><a href="../man8/dhclientscript.8.html">dhclient-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man8/dhclientscript.8.html">script</a>(8).</b>

        <b>vendor</b> <b>option</b> <b>space</b> <b>"</b><u>name</u><b>";</b>

       The <b>vendor</b> <b>option</b> <b>space</b> statement is used to specify which option space should be used for  decoding  the
       vendor-encapsulate-options  option if one is received.  The <u>dhcp-vendor-identifier</u> can be used to request
       a specific class of vendor options from the server.  See <b><a href="../man5/dhcp-options.5.html">dhcp-options</a>(5)</b> for details.

        <b>medium</b> <b>"</b><u>media</u> <u>setup</u><b>";</b>

       The <b>medium</b> statement can be used on systems where network interfaces cannot automatically  determine  the
       type  of  network  to  which  they are connected.  The media setup string is a system-dependent parameter
       which is passed to the dhcp client configuration script when initializing the  interface.   On  Unix  and
       Unix-like systems, the argument is passed on the ifconfig command line when configuring the interface.

       The  dhcp  client automatically declares this parameter if it uses a media type (see the <b>media</b> statement)
       when configuring the interface in order to obtain a lease.  This statement should be used  in  predefined
       leases only if the network interface requires media type configuration.

        <b>renew</b> <u>date</u><b>;</b>

        <b>rebind</b> <u>date</u><b>;</b>

        <b>expire</b> <u>date</u><b>;</b>

       The  <b>renew</b>  statement defines the time at which the dhcp client should begin trying to contact its server
       to renew a lease that it is using.  The <b>rebind</b> statement defines the time at which the dhcp client should
       begin to try to contact <u>any</u> dhcp server in order to renew its lease.  The <b>expire</b>  statement  defines  the
       time  at  which  the  dhcp  client must stop using a lease if it has not been able to contact a server in
       order to renew it.

       These declarations are automatically set in leases  acquired  by  the  DHCP  client,  but  must  also  be
       configured in predefined leases - a predefined lease whose expiry time has passed will not be used by the
       DHCP client.

       Dates are specified in one of two ways.  The software will output times in these two formats depending on
       if the <b>db-time-format</b> configuration parameter has been set to <u>default</u> or <u>local</u>.

       If it is set to <u>default</u>, then <u>date</u> values appear as follows:

        <u>&lt;weekday&gt;</u> <u>&lt;year&gt;</u><b>/</b><u>&lt;month&gt;</u><b>/</b><u>&lt;day&gt;</u> <u>&lt;hour&gt;</u><b>:</b><u>&lt;minute&gt;</u><b>:</b><u>&lt;second&gt;</u>

       The  weekday  is  present  to make it easy for a human to tell when a lease expires - it's specified as a
       number from zero to six, with zero being Sunday.  When declaring a predefined lease,  it  can  always  be
       specified  as zero.  The year is specified with the century, so it should generally be four digits except
       for really long leases.  The month is specified as a number starting with 1 for January.  The day of  the
       month  is likewise specified starting with 1.  The hour is a number between 0 and 23, the minute a number
       between 0 and 59, and the second also a number between 0 and 59.

       If the <b>db-time-format</b> configuration was set to <u>local</u>, then the <u>date</u> values appear as follows:

        <b>epoch</b> <u>&lt;seconds-since-epoch&gt;</u><b>;</b> <b>#</b> <u>&lt;day-name&gt;</u> <u>&lt;month-name&gt;</u> <u>&lt;day-number&gt;</u> <u>&lt;hours&gt;</u><b>:</b><u>&lt;minutes&gt;</u><b>:</b><u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u> <u>&lt;year&gt;</u>

       The <u>seconds-since-epoch</u> is as according to the system's local clock (often referred to as  "unix  time").
       The  <b>#</b>  symbol  supplies  a  comment that describes what actual time this is as according to the system's
       configured timezone, at the time the value was written.  It is provided only for  human  inspection,  the
       epoch time is the only recommended value for machine inspection.

       Note  that  when defining a static lease, one may use either time format one wishes, and need not include
       the comment or values after it.

       If the time is infinite in duration, then the <u>date</u> is <b>never</b> instead of an actual date.

</pre><h4><b>ALIAS</b> <b>DECLARATIONS</b></h4><pre>
        <b>alias</b> <b>{</b>  <u>declarations</u> <u>...</u> <b>}</b>

       Some DHCP clients running TCP/IP roaming protocols may require that in addition to  the  lease  they  may
       acquire  via  DHCP, their interface also be configured with a predefined IP alias so that they can have a
       permanent IP address even while roaming.  The Internet Systems Consortium  DHCP  client  doesn't  support
       roaming  with  fixed addresses directly, but in order to facilitate such experimentation, the dhcp client
       can be set up to configure an IP alias using the <b>alias</b> declaration.

       The alias declaration resembles a lease declaration, except  that  options  other  than  the  subnet-mask
       option  are ignored by the standard client configuration script, and expiry times are ignored.  A typical
       alias declaration includes an interface  declaration,  a  fixed-address  declaration  for  the  IP  alias
       address,  and  a subnet-mask option declaration.  A medium statement should never be included in an alias
       declaration.

        <b>db-time-format</b> [ <u>default</u> | <u>local</u> ] <b>;</b>

       The <b>db-time-format</b> option determines which of two output methods are used for printing  times  in  leases
       files.   The  <u>default</u>  format  provides  day-and-time in UTC, whereas <u>local</u> uses a seconds-since-epoch to
       store the time value, and helpfully places a local timezone time in a comment  on  the  same  line.   The
       formats are described in detail in this manpage, within the LEASE DECLARATIONS section.

       The <u>lease-id-format</u> parameter

         <b>lease-id-format</b> <u>format</u><b>;</b>

         The  <u>format</u>  parameter  must  be  either <b>octal</b> or <b>hex</b>.  This parameter governs the format used to write
         certain values to lease files. With the default format, octal, values are written as quoted strings  in
         which  non-printable  characters  are  represented as octal escapes - a backslash character followed by
         three octal digits.  When the hex format is specified, values are written  as  an  unquoted  series  of
         hexadecimal digit pairs, separated by colons.

         Currently,  the  values  written  out  based on lease-id-format are the default-duid and the IAID value
         (DHCPv6 only).  The client automatically reads the values in either format.  Note that when the  format
         is  octal, rather than as an octal string, IAID is output as hex if it contains no printable characters
         or as a string if contains only printable characters. This is done to maintain backward compatibility.

          <b>reject</b> <u>cidr-ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>...</u> <u>cidr-ip-address</u> ] <b>;</b>

         The <b>reject</b> statement causes the DHCP client to reject  offers  from  servers  whose  server  identifier
         matches  any of the specified hosts or subnets.  This can be used to avoid being configured by rogue or
         misconfigured dhcp servers, although it should be a last resort - better to track  down  the  bad  DHCP
         server and fix it.

         The  <u>cidr-ip-address</u>  configuration  type  is of the form <u>ip-address</u>[<b>/</b><u>prefixlen</u>], where <u>ip-address</u> is a
         dotted quad IP address, and prefixlen is the CIDR prefix length of the subnet, counting the  number  of
         significant bits in the netmask starting from the leftmost end.  Example configuration syntax:

         <u>reject</u> 192.168.0.0<b>/</b>16<b>,</b> 10.0.0.5<b>;</b>

         The  above  example  would  cause  offers  from  any server identifier in the entire RFC 1918 "Class C"
         network 192.168.0.0/16, or the specific single address 10.0.0.5, to be rejected.

          <b>interface</b> <b>"</b><u>name</u><b>"</b> <b>{</b> <u>declarations</u> <u>...</u>  <b>}</b>

         A client with more than one network interface  may  require  different  behaviour  depending  on  which
         interface  is  being  configured.   All  timing  parameters and declarations other than lease and alias
         declarations can be enclosed in an interface declaration, and those parameters will then be  used  only
         for  the  interface  that  matches  the  specified  name.   Interfaces  for which there is no interface
         declaration will use the parameters declared outside of  any  interface  declaration,  or  the  default
         settings.

         <b>Note</b>  <b>well:</b>  ISC  dhclient only maintains one list of interfaces, which is either determined at startup
         from command line arguments, or otherwise is autodetected.  If you supplied the list of  interfaces  on
         the command line, this configuration clause will add the named interface to the list in such a way that
         will  cause  it  to  be  configured by DHCP.  Which may not be the result you had intended.  This is an
         undesirable side effect that will be addressed in a future release.

          <b>pseudo</b> <b>"</b><u>name</u>" "<u>real-name</u><b>"</b> <b>{</b> <u>declarations</u> <u>...</u>  <b>}</b>

         Under some circumstances it can be useful to declare  a  pseudo-interface  and  have  the  DHCP  client
         acquire a configuration for that interface.  Each interface that the DHCP client is supporting normally
         has a DHCP client state machine running on it to acquire and maintain its lease.  A pseudo-interface is
         just  another  state  machine  running on the interface named <u>real-name</u>, with its own lease and its own
         state.  If you use this feature, you must provide a client identifier for both the pseudo-interface and
         the actual interface, and the two identifiers must be different.  You  must  also  provide  a  separate
         client script for the pseudo-interface to do what you want with the IP address.  For example:

              interface "ep0" {
                   send dhcp-client-identifier "my-client-ep0";
              }
              pseudo "secondary" "ep0" {
                   send dhcp-client-identifier "my-client-ep0-secondary";
                   script "/etc/dhclient-secondary";
              }

         The client script for the pseudo-interface should not configure the interface up or down - essentially,
         all  it needs to handle are the states where a lease has been acquired or renewed, and the states where
         a lease has expired.  See <b><a href="../man8/dhclient-script.8.html">dhclient-script</a>(8)</b> for more information.

          <b>media</b> <b>"</b><u>media</u> <u>setup</u><b>"</b> <u>[</u> <b>,</b> <b>"</b><u>media</u> <u>setup</u><b>",</b> <u>...</u> <u>]</u><b>;</b>

         The <b>media</b> statement defines one or more  media  configuration  parameters  which  may  be  tried  while
         attempting to acquire an IP address.  The dhcp client will cycle through each media setup string on the
         list,  configuring the interface using that setup and attempting to boot, and then trying the next one.
         This can be used for network interfaces which aren't capable  of  sensing  the  media  type  unaided  -
         whichever  media  type  succeeds  in  getting a request to the server and hearing the reply is probably
         right (no guarantees).

         The media setup is only used for the  initial  phase  of  address  acquisition  (the  DHCPDISCOVER  and
         DHCPOFFER  packets).   Once  an  address has been acquired, the dhcp client will record it in its lease
         database and will record the media type used to acquire the address.   Whenever  the  client  tries  to
         renew  the  lease,  it  will use that same media type.  The lease must expire before the client will go
         back to cycling through media types.

          <b>hardware</b> <u>link-type</u> <u>mac-address</u><b>;</b>

         The <b>hardware</b> statement defines the hardware MAC address to use for this interface, for DHCP servers  or
         relays  to direct their replies.  dhclient will determine the interface's MAC address automatically, so
         use of this parameter is not recommended.  The <u>link-type</u> corresponds to the interface's link layer type
         (example: ´ethernet´), while the <u>mac-address</u> is a string  of  colon-separated  hexadecimal  values  for
         octets.

          <b>anycast-mac</b> <u>link-type</u> <u>mac-address</u><b>;</b>

         The  <b>anycast-mac</b>  statement  over-rides the all-ones broadcast MAC address dhclient will use when it is
         transmitting packets to the all-ones limited broadcast IPv4 address.  This configuration  parameter  is
         useful to reduce the number of broadcast packets transmitted by DHCP clients, but is only useful if you
         know  the DHCP service(s) anycast MAC address prior to configuring your client.  The <u>link-type</u> and <u>mac-</u>
         <u>address</u> parameters are configured in a similar manner to the <b>hardware</b> statement.

</pre><h4><b>SAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The following configuration file was used on a laptop running NetBSD 1.3, though the  domains  have  been
       modified.   The  laptop  has  an  IP  alias  of  192.5.5.213, and has one interface, ep0 (a 3com 3C589C).
       Booting intervals have been shortened somewhat from the default, because the client  is  known  to  spend
       most of its time on networks with little DHCP activity.  The laptop does roam to multiple networks.

       timeout 300;
       retry 60;
       reboot 10;
       select-timeout 5;
       initial-interval 2;
       reject 192.33.137.209;

       interface "ep0" {
           send host-name "andare.example.com";
           hardware ethernet 00:a0:24:ab:fb:9c;
           send dhcp-client-identifier 1:0:a0:24:ab:fb:9c;
           send dhcp-lease-time 3600;
           supersede domain-search "example.com", "rc.isc.org", "home.isc.org";
           prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;
           request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
                domain-name, domain-name-servers, host-name;
           require subnet-mask, domain-name-servers;
           script "/sbin/dhclient-script";
           media "media 10baseT/UTP", "media 10base2/BNC";
       }

       alias {
         interface "ep0";
         fixed-address 192.5.5.213;
         option subnet-mask 255.255.255.255;
       }
       This is a very complicated dhclient.conf file - in general, yours should be much simpler.  In many cases,
       it's sufficient to just create an empty dhclient.conf file - the defaults are usually fine.
