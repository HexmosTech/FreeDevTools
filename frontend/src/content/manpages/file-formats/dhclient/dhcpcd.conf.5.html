       dhcpcd.conf — dhcpcd configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Although  <b>dhcpcd</b> can do everything from the command line, there are cases where it's just easier to do it
       once in a configuration file.  Most of the options found in <u><a href="../man8/dhcpcd.8.html">dhcpcd</a></u>(8) can be used here.  The  first  word
       on the line is the option and the rest of the line is the value.  Leading and trailing whitespace for the
       option  and  value  are trimmed.  You can escape characters in the value using the \ character.  Comments
       can be prefixed with the # character.  String values should be quoted with the " character.

       Here's a list of available options:

       <b>allowinterfaces</b> <u>pattern</u>
               When discovering interfaces, the interface name must match <u>pattern</u> which  is  a  space  or  comma
               separated  list  of  patterns  passed  to  <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3).   If  the  same  interface  is  matched in
               <b>denyinterfaces</b> then it is still denied.

       <b>denyinterfaces</b> <u>pattern</u>
               When discovering interfaces, the interface name must not match <u>pattern</u> which is a space or  comma
               separated list of patterns passed to <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3).

       <b>anonymous</b>
               Enables  Anonymity  Profiles  for  DHCP, RFC 7844.  Any DUID is ignored and ClientID is set to LL
               only.  All non essential options are then masked at this point, but they  could  be  unmasked  by
               explicitly requesting the option <b>after</b> the <b>anonymous</b> option is processed.  As such, the <b>anonymous</b>
               option  <b>should</b>  be  the last option in the configuration unless you really want to send something
               which could identify you.  <b>dhcpcd</b> will not try and reboot an old lease, it will go straight  into
               DISCOVER/SOLICIT.

       <b>randomise_hwaddr</b>
               Forces  a  hardware address randomisation when the interface is brought up or when the carrier is
               lost.  This is generally used in tandem with the anonymous option.

       <b>arping</b> <u>address</u> [address]
               <b>dhcpcd</b> will arping each address in order before attempting DHCP.  If an address is found, we will
               select the replying hardware address as the profile, otherwise the IP address.  Example:

                     interface bge0
                     arping 192.168.0.1

                     # My specific 192.168.0.1 network
                     profile dd:ee:aa:dd:bb:ee
                     static ip_address=192.168.0.10/24

                     # A generic 192.168.0.1 network
                     profile 192.168.0.1
                     static ip_address=192.168.0.98/24

       <b>authprotocol</b> <u>protocol</u> [<u>algorithm</u> [<u>rdm</u>]]
               Authenticate DHCP messages.  See the Supported Authentication Protocols section.  If <u>protocol</u>  is
               <u>token</u> then <u>algorithm</u> <u>is</u> snd_secretid/rcv_secretid so you can send and receive different tokens.

       <b>authtoken</b> <u>secretid</u> <u>realm</u> <u>expire</u> <u>key</u>
               Define  a  shared  key  for  use  in authentication.  <u>realm</u> can be "" to for use with the <u>delayed</u>
               protocol.  <u>expire</u> is the date the token expires and should be formatted "yyy-mm-dd  HH:MM".   You
               can  use  the  keyword <u>forever</u> or <u>0</u> which means the token never expires.  For the token protocol,
               <u>secretid</u> needs to be 0 and <u>realm</u> needs to be "".  If <b>dhcpcd</b> has the error
                     dhcp_auth_encode: Invalid argument
               then it means that <b>dhcpcd</b> could not find the correct authentication token in your configuration.

       <b>background</b>
               Fork to the background immediately.  This is useful for startup scripts which don't disable  link
               messages for carrier status.

       <b>blacklist</b> <u>address</u>[/cidr]
               Ignores all packets from <u>address</u>[/cidr].

       <b>whitelist</b> <u>address</u>[/cidr]
               Only accept packets from <u>address</u>[/cidr].  <b>blacklist</b> is ignored if <b>whitelist</b> is set.

       <b>bootp</b>   Be  a  BOOTP  client.  Basically, this just doesn't send a DHCP Message Type option and will only
               interact with a BOOTP server.  All other DHCP options still work.

       <b>broadcast</b>
               Instructs the DHCP server to broadcast replies back to the client.  Normally this is only set for
               non-Ethernet interfaces, such as FireWire and InfiniBand.  In most cases, <b>dhcpcd</b>  will  set  this
               automatically.

       <b>controlgroup</b> <u>group</u>
               Sets the group ownership of <u>/run/dhcpcd/sock</u> so that users other than root can connect to <b>dhcpcd</b>.

       <b>debug</b>   Echo debug messages to the stderr and syslog.

       <b>dev</b> <u>value</u>
               Load the <u>value</u> <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> management module.  <b>dhcpcd</b> will load the first one found to work, if any.

       <b>env</b> <u>value</u>
               Push  <u>value</u>  to  the  environment for use in <u><a href="../man8/dhcpcd-run-hooks.8.html">dhcpcd-run-hooks</a></u>(8).  For example, you can force the
               hostname hook to always set the hostname  with  <b>env</b>  <u>force_hostname=YES</u>.   Or  set  which  driver
               <u><a href="../man8/wpa_supplicant.8.html">wpa_supplicant</a></u>(8) should use with <b>env</b> <u>wpa_supplicant_driver=nl80211</u>

               If the hostname is set, it will be will set to the FQDN if possible as per RFC 4702, section 3.1.
               If  the FQDN option is missing, <b>dhcpcd</b> will still try and set a FQDN from the hostname and domain
               options for consistency.  To override this, set <b>env</b> <u>hostname_fqdn=[YES|NO|SERVER]</u>.   A  value  of
               <u>SERVER</u>  means just what the server says, don't manipulate it.  This could lead to an inconsistent
               hostname on a DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 network where the DHCPv4 hostname is short and the DHCPv6 has  an
               FQDN.  DHCPv6 has no hostname option.

       <b>clientid</b> <u>string</u>
               Send  the  <u>clientid</u>.   If  the  string  is of the format 01:02:03 then it is encoded as hex.  For
               interfaces whose hardware address is longer than 8 bytes, or if the <u>clientid</u> is an  empty  string
               then <b>dhcpcd</b> sends a default <u>clientid</u> of the hardware family and the hardware address.

       <b>duid</b> [ll | lt | uuid | value]
               Use  a  DHCP  Unique  Identifier.  If persistent storage is available then a DUID-LLT (link local
               address + time) is generated, otherwise DUID-LL is generated (link local address).  The DUID type
               can be hinted as an optional parameter if the file <u><a href="file:/var/lib/dhcpcd/duid">/var/lib/dhcpcd/duid</a></u> does not exist.   If  not
               <u>ll</u>, <u>lt</u> or <u>uuid</u> then <u>value</u> will be converted from 00:11:22:33 format.  This, plus the IAID will be
               used  as the <b>clientid</b>.  The DUID generated will be held in <u><a href="file:/var/lib/dhcpcd/duid">/var/lib/dhcpcd/duid</a></u> and should not be
               copied to other hosts.  This file also takes precedence over the above rules except for setting a
               value.

       <b>iaid</b> <u>iaid</u>
               Set the Interface Association Identifier to <u>iaid</u>.  This option  must  be  used  in  an  <b>interface</b>
               block.   This defaults to the VLANID (prefixed with 0xff) for the interface if set, otherwise the
               last 4 bytes of the hardware address assigned to the interface.  Each instance of this should  be
               unique  within the scope of the client and <b>dhcpcd</b> warns if a conflict is detected.  If there is a
               conflict, it is only a problem if the conflicted IAIDs are used on the same network.

       <b>dhcp</b>    Enable DHCP on the interface, on by default.

       <b>dhcp6</b>   Enable DHCPv6 on the interface, on by default.

       <b>ipv4</b>    Enable IPv4 on the interface, on by default.

       <b>ipv6</b>    Enable IPv6 on the interface, on by default.

       <b>request</b> [<u>address</u>]
               Request the <u>address</u> in the DHCP DISCOVER message.  There is no guarantee this is the address  the
               DHCP server will actually give.  If no <u>address</u> is given then the first address currently assigned
               to the <u>interface</u> is used.

       <b>inform</b> [<u>address</u>[<u>/cidr</u>[<u>/broadcast_address</u>]]]
               Behaves  like  <b>request</b>  as above, but sends a DHCP INFORM instead of DISCOVER/REQUEST.  This does
               not get a lease as such, just notifies the DHCP server of the <u>address</u> in use.   You  should  also
               include  the  optional  <u>cidr</u>  network number in case the address is not already configured on the
               interface.  <b>dhcpcd</b> remains running and pretends it has an infinite lease.  <b>dhcpcd</b>  will  not  de-
               configure  the interface when it exits.  If <b>dhcpcd</b> fails to contact a DHCP server then it returns
               a failure instead of falling back on IPv4LL.

       <b>inform6</b>
               Performs a DHCPv6 Information Request.  No address is  requested  or  specified,  but  all  other
               DHCPv6  options  are  allowed.   This  is  normally  performed  automatically when an IPv6 Router
               Advertisement indicates that the client should perform  this  operation.   This  option  is  only
               needed  when  <b>dhcpcd</b>  is  not  processing  IPv6 RA messages and the need for a DHCPv6 Information
               Request exists.

       <b>persistent</b>
               <b>dhcpcd</b> normally de-configures the interface and configuration when  it  exits.   Sometimes,  this
               isn't  desirable  if,  for example, you have root mounted over NFS or SSH clients connect to this
               host and they need to be notified of the host shutting down.  You can use  this  option  to  stop
               this from happening.

       <b>fallback</b> <u>profile</u>
               Fall  back  to  using  this profile if DHCP fails.  This allows you to configure a static profile
               instead of using ZeroConf.

       <b>fallback_time</b> <u>seconds</u>
               Start fallback after <u>seconds</u>.  The default is 5 seconds.

       <b>hostname</b> <u>name</u>
               Sends the hostname <u>name</u> to the DHCP server so it can be registered in DNS.  If <u>name</u> is  an  empty
               string  then the current system hostname is sent.  If <u>name</u> is a FQDN (i.e., contains a .) then it
               will be encoded as such.

       <b>hostname_short</b>
               Sends the short hostname to the DHCP server instead of the FQDN.  This  is  useful  because  DHCP
               servers will not register the FQDN in their DNS if the domain part does not match theirs.

               Also, see the <b>env</b> option above to control how the hostname is set on the host.

       <b>ia_na</b> [<u>iaid</u> [/ address]]
               Request  a  DHCPv6 Normal Address for <u>iaid</u>.  <u>iaid</u> defaults to the <b>iaid</b> option as described above.
               You can request more than one ia_na by specifying a unique <u>iaid</u> for each one.

       <b>ia_ta</b> [<u>iaid</u>]
               Request a DHCPv6 Temporary Address for <u>iaid</u>.  You can request more than one ia_ta by specifying a
               unique <u>iaid</u> for each one.

       <b>ia_pd</b> [<u>iaid</u> [/ <u>prefix</u> <u>/</u> <u>prefix_len</u>] [<u>interface</u> [/ <u>sla_id</u> [/ <u>prefix_len</u> [/ <u>suffix</u>]]]]]
               Request a DHCPv6 Delegated Prefix for <u>iaid</u>.  This option must be  used  in  an  <b>interface</b>  block.
               Unless  a  <u>sla_id</u>  of  0  is  assigned with the same resultant prefix length as the delegation, a
               reject route is installed for the Delegated Prefix to stop unallocated addresses  being  resolved
               upstream.   If no <u>interface</u> is given then we will assign a prefix to every other interface with a
               <u>sla_id</u> equivalent to the interface index assigned  by  the  OS.   Otherwise  addresses  are  only
               assigned  for  each  <u>interface</u>  and  <u>sla_id</u>.   To avoid delegating to any interface, use - as the
               invalid interface name.  Each assigned address will have a  <u>suffix</u>,  defaulting  to  1.   If  the
               <u>suffix</u>  is  0  then  a  SLAAC  address is assigned.  You cannot assign a prefix to the requesting
               interface unless the DHCPv6 server supports the <b>RFC</b> <b>6603</b> Prefix Exclude Option.  <b>dhcpcd</b> has to be
               running for all the interfaces it is delegating to.  A  default  <u>prefix_len</u>  of  64  is  assumed,
               unless  the  maximum  <u>sla_id</u>  does  not fit.  In this case <u>prefix_len</u> is increased to the highest
               multiple of 8 that can accommodate the <u>sla_id</u>.  <u>sla_id</u> is an integer which must be unique  inside
               the  <u>iaid</u>  and  is  added  to  the prefix which must fit inside <u>prefix_len</u> less the length of the
               delegated prefix.  You can specify multiple <u>interface</u> <u>/</u> <u>sla_id</u>  <u>/</u>  <u>prefix_len</u>  per  <b>ia_pd</b>,  space
               separated.  IPv6RS should be disabled globally when requesting a Prefix Delegation.

               In  the  following example eth0 is the externally facing interface to be configured for both IPv4
               and IPv6.  The DHCPv4 server will provide us with an IPv4  address  and  a  default  route.   The
               DHCPv6 server is going to provide us with an IPv6 address, a default route and a /64 subnet to be
               delegated  to  the  internal  interface.  The eth1 interface will be automatically configured for
               IPv6 using the first address (::1) from the delegated prefix.  A second prefix is  requested  and
               assigned  to  two  other  interfaces.   <u><a href="../man8/rtadvd.8.html">rtadvd</a></u>(8) can be used with an empty configuration file on
               eth1, eth2 and eth3, to provide automatic IPv6 address configuration for the internal network.

               noipv6rs                 # disable routing solicitation
               denyinterfaces eth2      # Don't touch eth2 at all
               interface eth0
                 ipv6rs                 # enable routing solicitation for eth0
                 ia_na 1                # request an IPv6 address
                 ia_pd 2 eth1/0         # request a PD and assign it to eth1
                 ia_pd 3 eth2/1 eth3/2  # req a PD and assign it to eth2 and eth3
                 ia_pd 4 -              # request a PD but don't assign it

       <b>ipv4only</b>
               Only configure IPv4.

       <b>ipv6only</b>
               Only configure IPv6.

       <b>fqdn</b> [disable | none | ptr | both]
               <u>none</u> will not ask the DHCP server to update DNS.  <u>ptr</u> just asks the DHCP server to update the PTR
               record of the host in DNS, whereas <u>both</u> also updates the A record.  <u>disable</u> will disable the FQDN
               option.  The default is <u>both</u>.  <b>dhcpcd</b> itself never does any DNS updates.  <b>dhcpcd</b> encodes the FQDN
               hostname as specified in <b>RFC</b> <b>1035</b>.

       <b>interface</b> <u>interface</u>
               Subsequent options  are  only  parsed  for  this  <u>interface</u>.   Pattern  matching  is  allowed  by
               <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3).

       <b>ipv4ll_time</b> <u>seconds</u>
               Wait for <u>seconds</u> before starting IPv4LL.  The default is 5 seconds.

       <b>ipv6ra_autoconf</b>
               Generate  SLAAC addresses for each Prefix advertised by an IPv6 Router Advertisement message with
               the Auto flag set.  On by default.

       <b>ipv6ra_noautoconf</b>
               Disables the above option.

       <b>ipv6ra_fork</b>
               By default, when <b>dhcpcd</b> receives an IPv6 Router Advertisement,  <b>dhcpcd</b>  will  only  fork  to  the
               background if the RA contains at least one unexpired RDNSS option and a valid prefix or no DHCPv6
               instruction.  Set this option so to make <b>dhcpcd</b> always fork on a RA.

       <b>ipv6rs</b>  Enables IPv6 Router Advertisement solicitation.  This is on by default, but is documented here in
               the case where it is disabled globally but needs to be enabled for one interface.

       <b>lastlease</b>
               If <b>dhcpcd</b> cannot obtain a lease, then try to use the last lease acquired for the interface.

       <b>lastleaseextend</b>
               Same  as the above, but the lease will be retained even if it expires.  <b>dhcpcd</b> will give it up if
               any other host tries to claim it for their own via ARP.  This violates  RFC  2131,  section  3.7,
               which states the lease should be dropped once it has expired.

       <b>leasetime</b> <u>seconds</u>
               Request  DHCP  a lease time of <u>seconds</u>.  <u>-1</u> represents an infinite lease time.  By default <b>dhcpcd</b>
               does not request any lease time and leaves it in the  hands  of  the  DHCP  server.   It  is  not
               possible  to  request a DHCPv6 lease time as this is not RFC compliant.  See RFC 8415 21.4, 21.6,
               21.21 and 21.22.

       <b>link_rcvbuf</b> <u>size</u>
               Override the size of the link receive buffer from the kernel default.  While <b>dhcpcd</b> will  recover
               from link buffer overflows, this may not be desirable on heavily loaded systems.

       <b>logfile</b> <u>logfile</u>
               Writes to the specified <u>logfile</u>.  <b>dhcpcd</b> still writes to <u><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></u>(3).  The <u>logfile</u> is reopened when
               <b>dhcpcd</b> receives the SIGUSR2 signal.

       <b>metric</b> <u>metric</u>
               Metrics  are  used  to  prefer  an interface over another one, lowest wins.  <b>dhcpcd</b> will supply a
               default metric of 1000 + <u><a href="../man3/if_nametoindex.3.html">if_nametoindex</a></u>(3).  This will be offset by 2000 for wireless interfaces,
               with additional offsets of 1000000 for IPv4LL and 2000000 for roaming interfaces.

       <b>mudurl</b> <u>url</u>
               Specifies the URL for a Manufacturer  Usage  Description  (MUD).   The  description  is  used  by
               upstream  network devices to instantiate any desired access lists.  See draft-ietf-opsawg-mud for
               more information.

       <b>noalias</b>
               Any pre-existing IPv4 addresses will be removed  from  the  interface  when  adding  a  new  IPv4
               address.

       <b>noarp</b>   Don't send any ARP requests.  This also disables IPv4LL.

       <b>arp_persistdefence</b>
               Keep the IP address even if defence fails upon IP Address conflict.

       <b>noauthrequired</b>
               Don't require authentication even though we requested it.  Also allows FORCERENEW and RECONFIGURE
               messages without authentication.

       <b>nodelay</b>
               Don't delay for an initial randomised time when starting protocols.

       <b>nodev</b>   Don't load <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> management modules.

       <b>nodhcp</b>  Don't start DHCP or listen to DHCP messages.  This is only useful when allowing IPv4LL.

       <b>nodhcp6</b>
               Don't  start  DHCPv6  or listen to DHCPv6 messages.  Normally DHCPv6 is started by an IPv6 Router
               Advertisement instruction or configuration.

       <b>nogateway</b>
               Don't install any default routes.

       <b>gateway</b>
               Install a default route if available (default).

       <b>nohook</b> <u>script</u>
               Don't run this hook script.  Matches full name, or prefixed with 2 numbers optionally ending with
               <u>.sh</u>.

               So to stop <b>dhcpcd</b> from touching your DNS settings or starting wpa_supplicant you would do:-
                     nohook resolv.conf, wpa_supplicant

       <b>noipv4</b>  Don't attempt to configure an IPv4 address.

       <b>noipv4ll</b>
               Don't attempt to obtain an IPv4LL address if we failed to get one via DHCP.  See <u>RFC</u> <u>3927</u>.

       <b>noipv6</b>  Don't solicit or accept IPv6 Router Advertisements and DHCPv6.

       <b>noipv6rs</b>
               Don't solicit or accept IPv6 Router Advertisements.

       <b>nolink</b>  Don't receive link messages about carrier status.  You should only set this for  buggy  interface
               drivers.

       <b>nosyslog</b>
               Disable writing to <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a>(3).

       <b>noup</b>    Don't bring the interface up when in manager mode.

       <b>option</b> <u>option</u>
               Requests  the  <u>option</u> from the server.  It can be a variable to be used in <u><a href="../man8/dhcpcd-run-hooks.8.html">dhcpcd-run-hooks</a></u>(8) or
               the numerical value.  You can specify more <u>option</u>s separated by commas,  spaces  or  more  <b>option</b>
               lines.   Prepend  dhcp6_  to  <u>option</u>  to  request  a  DHCPv6  option.   If  no DHCPv6 options are
               configured, then DHCPv4 options are mapped to equivalent DHCPv6 options.

               Prepend nd_ to <u>option</u> to handle ND options, but this only works  for  the  <b>nooption</b>,  <b>reject</b>  and
               <b>require</b> options.

               To see a list of options you can use, call <b>dhcpcd</b> with the <b>-V</b>, <b>--variables</b> argument.

       <b>nooption</b> <u>option</u>
               Remove the option from the message before it's processed.

       <b>require</b> <u>option</u>
               Requires  the <u>option</u> to be present in all messages, otherwise the message is ignored.  To enforce
               that  <b>dhcpcd</b>  only  responds  to  DHCP  servers  and  not  BOOTP   servers,   you   can   <b>require</b>
               <u>dhcp_message_type</u>.   This isn't an exact science though because a BOOTP server can send DHCP-like
               options.

       <b>reject</b> <u>option</u>
               Reject a message that contains the <u>option</u>.  This is useful when you cannot use <b>require</b> to  select
               / de-select BOOTP messages.

       <b>destination</b> <u>option</u>
               If  <b>dhcpcd.conf</b>  detects  an  address added to a point to point interface (PPP, TUN, etc) then it
               will set the listed DHCP options to the destination address of the interface.

       <b>profile</b> <u>name</u>
               Subsequent options are only parsed for this profile <u>name</u>.

       <b>quiet</b>   Suppress any dhcpcd output to the console, except for errors.

       <b>reboot</b> <u>seconds</u>
               Allow <u>reboot</u> seconds before moving to the DISCOVER phase if we have an old lease to  use.   Allow
               <u>reboot</u>  seconds  before starting fallback states from the DISCOVER phase.  IPv4LL is started when
               the first <u>reboot</u> timeout is reached.  The default is 5 seconds.  A setting of  0  seconds  causes
               <b>dhcpcd.conf</b> to skip the reboot phase and go straight into DISCOVER.  This is desirable for mobile
               users  because  if  you  change  from network A to network B and they use the same subnet and the
               address from network A isn't in use on network B, then the DHCP server will remain silent even if
               authoritative which means <b>dhcpcd</b> will timeout before moving back to the DISCOVER phase.  This has
               no effect on DHCPv6 other than skipping the reboot phase.

       <b>release</b>
               <b>dhcpcd</b> will release the lease prior to stopping the interface.

       <b>script</b> <u>script</u>
               Use <u>script</u> instead of the default <u><a href="file:/usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-run-hooks">/usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-run-hooks</a></u>.

       <b>request_time</b> <u>seconds</u>
               Request the lease for <u>seconds</u> before going back to DISCOVER.  The default is 180 seconds.

       <b>ssid</b> <u>ssid</u>
               Subsequent options are only parsed for this wireless <u>ssid</u>.

       <b>slaac</b> <b>hwaddr</b> | <b>private</b> | <b>token</b> <u>token</u> [<b>temp</b> | <b>temporary</b>]
               Selects the interface identifier used for SLAAC generated IPv6 addresses.  If <b>private</b> is used,  a
               RFC 7217 address is generated.  If <b>token</b> <u>token</u> is used then the token is combined with the prefix
               to  make  the  final  address.   The  <b>temporary</b> directive will create a temporary address for the
               prefix as well.

       <b>static</b> <u>value</u>
               Configures a static <u>value</u>.  If you set <b>ip_address</b> then <b>dhcpcd</b> will not attempt to obtain a  lease
               and  will  just  use  the value for the address with an infinite lease time.  If you set an empty
               value this removes all prior static allocations to the same value.  This  is  useful  when  using
               profiles  and  in the case of <b>ip_address</b> it will remove the static allocation.  Note that setting
               0.0.0.0 keeps the static allocation but waits for a 3rdparty to configure the  address.   If  you
               set <b>ip6_address</b>, <b>dhcpcd</b> will continue auto-configuration as normal.

               Here  is  an  example  which configures two static address, overriding the default IPv4 broadcast
               address, an IPv4 router, DNS and disables  IPv6  auto-configuration.   You  could  also  use  the
               <b>inform6</b>  command  here if you wished to obtain more information via DHCPv6.  For IPv4, you should
               use the <b>inform</b> <u>ipaddress</u> option instead of setting a static address.
                     interface eth0
                     noipv6rs
                     static ip_address=192.168.0.10/24
                     static broadcast_address=192.168.0.63
                     static ip6_address=fd51:42f8:caae:d92e::ff/64
                     static routers=192.168.0.1
                     static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1 fd51:42f8:caae:d92e::1

               Here is an example for PPP which gives the destination a default  route.   It  uses  the  special
               <u>destination</u> keyword to insert the destination address into the value.
                     interface ppp0
                     static ip_address=0.0.0.0
                     destination routers

       <b>timeout</b> <u>seconds</u>
               Time  out after <u>seconds</u>, instead of the default 30.  A setting of 0 <u>seconds</u> causes <b>dhcpcd</b> to wait
               forever to get a lease.  If <b>dhcpcd</b> is working on a single interface then <b>dhcpcd</b> will exit when  a
               timeout  occurs,  otherwise  <b>dhcpcd</b>  will  fork into the background.  If using IPv4LL then <b>dhcpcd</b>
               start the IPv4LL process after the timeout and then wait a little  longer  before  really  timing
               out.

       <b>userclass</b> <u>string</u>
               Tag the DHCPv4 message with the userclass.  You can specify more than one.

       <b>msuserclass</b> <u>string</u>
               Tag  the  DHCPv4 mesasge with the Microsoft userclass.  Unlike the <b>userclass</b> option, this one can
               only be added once.  It should only be used for Microsoft  DHCP  servers  and  the  <b>vendorclassid</b>
               should be set to "MSFT 98" or "MSFT 5.0".  This option is not RFC compliant.

       <b>vendor</b> <u>code</u>,<u>value</u>
               Add  an encapsulated vendor-specific information option (DHCP Option 43).  <u>code</u> should be between
               1 and 254 inclusive.  To add a raw vendor string, omit <u>code</u> but keep the comma.  Examples.

               Set the vendor option 01 with an IP address.
                     vendor 01,192.168.0.2
               Set the vendor option 02 with a hex code.
                     vendor 02,01:02:03:04:05
               Set the vendor option 03 with an IP address as a string.
                     vendor 03,\"192.168.0.2\"
               Set un-encapsulated vendor option to hello world.
                     vendor ,"hello world"

       <b>vsio</b> <u>en</u> <u>code,value</u>
               Add an encapsulated vendor-specific information option  (DHCP  Option  125)  with  IANA  assigned
               Enterprise  Number  <u>en</u>  proceeding with the <u>code</u> which should be between 1 and 255 inclusive, and
               the <u>value</u> after the comma.  Examples:

               Set the vsio for enterprise number 155 option 01 with an IPv4 address.
                     vsio 155 01,192.168.1.1
               Set the vsio for enterprise number 155 option 02 with a string.
                     vsio 155 02,"hello world"
               Set the vsio for enterprise number 255 option 01 with a hex code.
                     vsio 255 01,01:02:03:04:05

       <b>vsio6</b> <u>en</u> <u>code,value</u>
               Add an encapsulated vendor-specific information option (DHCPv6  Option  17)  with  IANA  assigned
               Enterprise  Number <u>en</u> proceeding with the <u>code</u> which should be between 1 and 65535 inclusive, and
               the <u>value</u> after the comma.  Examples:

               Set the vsio for enterprise number 155 option 01 with an IPv6 address.
                     vsio6 155 01,2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
               Set the vsio for enterprise number 155 option 02 with a string.
                     vsio6 155 02,"hello world"
               Set the vsio for enterprise number 255 option 01 with a hex code.
                     vsio6 255 01,01:02:03:04:05

       <b>vendorclassid</b> <u>string</u>
               Set the DHCP Vendor  Class.   DHCPv6  has  its  own  option  as  shown  below.   The  default  is
               dhcpcd-&lt;version&gt;:&lt;os&gt;:&lt;machine&gt;:&lt;platform&gt;.  For example
                     dhcpcd-5.5.6:NetBSD-6.99.5:i386:i386
               If  not set then none is sent.  Some badly configured DHCP servers reject unknown vendorclassids.
               To work around it, try and impersonate Windows by using the MSFT vendorclassid.

       <b>vendclass</b> <u>en</u> <u>data</u>
               Add the DHCPv6 Vendor Indetifying Vendor Class with the IANA assigned Enterprise Number  <u>en</u>  with
               the  <u>data</u>.  This option can be set more than once to add more data, but the behaviour, as per RFC
               3925 is undefined if the Enterprise Number differs.

       <b>waitip</b> [4 | 6]
               Wait for an address to be assigned before forking to the background.  4 means wait  for  an  IPv4
               address  to  be  assigned.   6  means wait for an IPv6 address to be assigned.  If no argument is
               given, <b>dhcpcd.conf</b> will wait for any address protocol to be assigned.  It is possible to wait for
               more than one address protocol and <b>dhcpcd.conf</b> will only fork to the background when all  waiting
               conditions are satisfied.

       <b>xidhwaddr</b>
               Use  the  last four bytes of the hardware address as the DHCP xid instead of a randomly generated
               number.

   <b>Defining</b> <b>new</b> <b>options</b>
       DHCP, ND and DHCPv6 allow for the use of custom options, and RFC 3925 vendor options for DHCP can also be
       supplied.  Each option needs to be started with the <b>define</b>, <b>definend</b>, <b>define6</b> or <b>vendopt</b> directive.  This
       can optionally be followed by both <b>embed</b> or <b>encap</b> options.  Both can be  specified  more  than  once  and
       <b>embed</b> must come before <b>encap</b>.

       <b>define</b> <u>code</u> <u>type</u> <u>variable</u>
               Defines the DHCP option <u>code</u> of <u>type</u> with a name of <u>variable</u> exported to <u><a href="../man8/dhcpcd-run-hooks.8.html">dhcpcd-run-hooks</a></u>(8).

       <b>definend</b> <u>code</u> <u>type</u> <u>variable</u>
               Defines  the ND option <u>code</u> of <u>type</u> with a name of <u>variable</u> exported to <u><a href="../man8/dhcpcd-run-hooks.8.html">dhcpcd-run-hooks</a></u>(8), with
               a prefix of <u>nd</u><b>_</b>.

       <b>define6</b> <u>code</u> <u>type</u> <u>variable</u>
               Defines the DHCPv6 option <u>code</u> of <u>type</u> with a name of <u>variable</u> exported  to  <u><a href="../man8/dhcpcd-run-hooks.8.html">dhcpcd-run-hooks</a></u>(8),
               with a prefix of <u>dhcp6</u><b>_</b>.

       <b>vendopt</b> <u>code</u> <u>type</u> <u>variable</u>
               Defines the Vendor-Identifying Vendor Options.  The <u>code</u> is the IANA Enterprise Number which will
               uniquely  describe  the encapsulated options.  <u>type</u> is normally <u>encap</u>.  <u>variable</u> names the Vendor
               option to be exported.

       <b>embed</b> <u>type</u> <u>variable</u>
               Defines an embedded variable within the defined option.  The length is determined  by  the  <u>type</u>.
               If  the  <u>variable</u> is not the same as defined in the parent option, it is prefixed with the parent
               <u>variable</u> first with an underscore.  If the <u>variable</u> has the name  of  <u>reserved</u>  then  it  is  not
               processed.

       <b>encap</b> <u>code</u> <u>type</u> <u>variable</u>
               Defines  an  encapsulated  variable  within  the defined option.  The length is determined by the
               <u>type</u>.  If the <u>variable</u> is not the same as defined in the parent option, it is prefixed  with  the
               parent <u>variable</u> first with an underscore.

   <b>Type</b> <b>prefix</b>
       These  keywords  come  before the type itself, to describe it more fully.  You can use more than one, but
       they must appear in the order listed below.

       <b>request</b>  Requests the option by default without having to be specified in user configuration.

       <b>norequest</b>
                This option cannot be requested, regardless of user configuration.

       <b>optional</b>
                This option is optional.  Only makes sense for embedded options like  the  client  FQDN  option,
                where the FQDN string itself is optional.

       <b>index</b>    The option can appear more than once and will be indexed.

       <b>array</b>    The option data is split into a space separated array, each element being the same type.

   <b>Types</b> <b>to</b> <b>define</b>
       The  type directly affects the length of data consumed inside the option.  Any remaining data is normally
       discarded.  Lengths can be specified for string and binhex types, but this is generally with  other  data
       embedded afterwards in the same option.

       <b>ipaddress</b>
               An IPv4 address, 4 bytes.

       <b>ip6address</b>
               An IPv6 address, 16 bytes.

       <b>string</b> [: <b>length</b>]
               A NVT ASCII string of printable characters.

       <b>byte</b>    A byte.

       <b>bitflags</b>: <b>flags</b>
               A byte represented as a string of flags, most significant bit first.  For example, using ABCDEFGH
               then A would equal 10000000, B 01000000, C 00100000, etc.  If the bit is not set, the flag is not
               printed.   A  flag  of  0  is  not  printed  even  if  the bit position is set.  This is to allow
               reservation of the first bits while assigning the last bits.

       <b>int16</b>   A signed 16bit integer, 2 bytes.

       <b>uint16</b>  An unsigned 16bit integer, 2 bytes.

       <b>int32</b>   A signed 32bit integer, 4 bytes.

       <b>uint32</b>  An unsigned 32bit integer, 4 bytes.

       <b>flag</b>    A fixed value (1) to indicate that the option is present, 0 bytes.

       <b>domain</b>  An RFC 3397 encoded string.

       <b>dname</b>   An RFC 1035 validated string.

       <b>uri</b>     If an array then the first two bytes are the URI length inside the option data.   Otherwise,  the
               whole  option data is the URI.  As a space is not allowed in the URI encoding, the URIs are space
               separated.

       <b>binhex</b> [: <b>length</b>]
               Binary data expressed as hexadecimal.

       <b>embed</b>   Contains embedded options (implies encap as well).

       <b>encap</b>   Contains encapsulated options (implies embed as well).

       <b>option</b>  References an option from the global definition.

   <b>Example</b> <b>definition</b>
             # DHCP option 81, Fully Qualified Domain Name, RFC 4702
             define 81 embed fqdn
             embed byte flags
             embed byte rcode1
             embed byte rcode2
             embed domain fqdn

             # DHCP option 125, Vendor Specific Information Option, RFC 3925
             define 125 encap vsio

             # Options defined for the enterprise number
             encap 1 ipaddress ipaddress

   <b>Supported</b> <b>Authentication</b> <b>Protocols</b>
       <b>token</b>    Sends a plain text token the server expects and matches a token sent by the server.  The  tokens
                do  not  have  to  be  the same.  If unspecified, the token with a <u>secretid</u> of 0 will be used in
                sending messages and validating received messages.

       <b>delayedrealm</b>
                Delayed Authentication.  <b>dhcpcd</b> will send an authentication option with  no  key  or  MAC.   The
                server will see this option, and select a key for <b>dhcpcd.conf</b>, writing the <u>realm</u> and <u>secretid</u> in
                it.   <b>dhcpcd</b>  will  then  look  for an unexpired token with a matching <u>realm</u> and <u>secretid</u>.  This
                token is used to authenticate all other messages.

       <b>delayed</b>  Same as above, but without a realm.

   <b>Supported</b> <b>Authentication</b> <b>Algorithms</b>
       If none specified, <b>hmac-md5</b> is the default.

       <b>hmac-md5</b>

   <b>Supported</b> <b>Replay</b> <b>Detection</b> <b>Mechanisms</b>
       If none specified, <b>monotonic</b> is the default.  If this is changed from what was previously  used,  or  the
       means  of calculating or storing it is broken, then the DHCP server will probably have to have its notion
       of the client's Replay Detection Value reset.

       <b>monocounter</b>
                Read the number in the file <u>/var/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-rdm.monotonic</u> and add one to it.

       <b>monotime</b>
                Create an NTP timestamp from the system time.

       <b>monotonic</b>
                Same as <b>monotime</b>.
