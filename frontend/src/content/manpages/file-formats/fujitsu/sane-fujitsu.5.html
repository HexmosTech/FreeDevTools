</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-fujitsu - SANE backend for Fujitsu and Ricoh fi series scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-fujitsu</b>  library  implements  a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend which provides access to
       most Fujitsu flatbed and ADF scanners, and the subsequent Ricoh models.

       This document describes backend version 140.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       This version supports every known model which  speaks  the  Fujitsu  SCSI  and  SCSI-over-USB  protocols.
       Specifically,  the  SCSI M309x and M409x series, the SCSI fi-series, and most of the USB fi-, ScanSnap, &amp;
       iX      series      scanners      are      supported.       Please      see       the       list       at
       <u><a href="http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html">http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html</a></u> for details.

       This  backend  may  support  other  Fujitsu  or  newer Ricoh scanners. The best way to determine level of
       support is to test the scanner directly, or to collect a trace of the windows driver in  action.   Please
       contact the author for help or with test results.

</pre><h4><b>UNSUPPORTED</b> <b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  scanners are known NOT to work with this backend, either because they have an unsupported
       chipset, or an unsupported interface type. Some of these scanners may be supported by another backend.

                                        SP-2x/3x

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Effort has been made to expose all hardware options, including:

       <b>source</b> <b>s</b>
              Selects the source for the scan. Options may include "Flatbed",  "ADF  Front",  "ADF  Back",  "ADF
              Duplex", "Card Front", "Card Back", "Card Duplex".

       <b>mode</b> <b>m</b>
              Selects the mode for the scan. Options may include "Lineart", "Halftone", "Gray", and "Color".

       <b>resolution,</b> <b>y-resolution</b>
              Controls  scan  resolution. Setting <b>--resolution</b> also sets <b>--y-resolution,</b> though this behavior is
              overridden by some frontends.

       <b>tl-x,</b> <b>tl-y,</b> <b>br-x,</b> <b>br-y</b>
              Sets scan area upper left and lower right coordinates. These are  renamed  <b>t,</b>  <b>l,</b>  <b>x,</b>  <b>y</b>  by  some
              frontends.

       <b>page-width,</b> <b>page-height</b>
              Sets  paper  size.  Used  by scanner to determine centering of scan coordinates when using the ADF
              (Automatic Document Feeder) and to detect double feed errors.

       Other options will be available based on the capabilities of the scanner: machines with IPC or  DTC  will
       have  additional  enhancement options, those with CMP will have compression options, those with a printer
       will have a group of endorser options.

       Additionally, several 'software' options are exposed by  the  backend.  These  are  reimplementations  of
       features  provided  natively  by  larger scanners, but running on the host computer. This enables smaller
       machines to have similar capabilities. Please note that these features are somewhat simplistic,  and  may
       not  perform  as  well  as the native implementations. Note also that these features all require that the
       driver cache the entire image in memory. This will almost certainly result in  a  reduction  of  scanning
       speed.

       <b>swcrop</b>
              Requests  the  driver to detect the extremities of the paper within the larger image, and crop the
              empty edges.

       <b>swdeskew</b>
              Requests the driver to detect the rotation of the paper within the larger image, and  counter  the
              rotation.

       <b>swdespeck</b> <b>X</b>
              Requests  the driver to find and remove dots of X diameter or smaller from the image, and fill the
              space with the average surrounding color.

       Use <u>'scanimage</u> <u>--help'</u> to get a list, but be aware that some options may be settable  only  when  another
       option has been set, and that advanced options may be hidden by some frontend programs.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration  file  <u>fujitsu.conf</u>  is used to tell the backend how to look for scanners, and provide
       options controlling the operation of the backend.  This file is read each  time  the  frontend  asks  the
       backend  for  a  list  of scanners, generally only when the frontend starts. If the configuration file is
       missing, the backend will be unable to locate any scanners.

       Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in 4 ways:

       "scsi FUJITSU"
              Requests backend to search all scsi buses in the system for a device which reports itself to be  a
              scanner made by 'FUJITSU'.

       "scsi /dev/sg0" (or other scsi device file)
              Requests  backend  to  open  the  named  scsi  device. Only useful if you have multiple compatible
              scanners connected to your system, and need to specify one. Probably should not be used  with  the
              other "scsi" line above.

       "usb 0x04c5 0x1042" (or other vendor/product ids)
              Requests  backend  to  search  all usb buses in the system for a device which uses that vendor and
              product id. The device will then be queried to determine if it is a supported scanner.

       "usb /dev/usb/scanner0" (or other device file)
              Some systems use a kernel driver to access usb scanners. This method is untested.

       The only configuration option supported is "buffer-size=xxx", allowing you to set the number of bytes  in
       the  data  buffer  to  something  other than the compiled-in default, 65536 (64K). Some users report that
       their scanner will "hang" mid-page, or fail to transmit the image if the buffer is not large enough.

       Note: This option may appear multiple times in the  configuration  file.  It  only  applies  to  scanners
       discovered by 'scsi/usb' lines that follow this option.

       Note:  The  backend  does  not  place an upper bound on this value, as some users required it to be quite
       large. Values above the default are not recommended, and may crash your  OS  or  lockup  your  scsi  card
       driver. You have been warned.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  backend  uses  a  single environment variable, <b>SANE_DEBUG_FUJITSU</b>, which enables debugging output to
       stderr. Valid values are:

              5  Errors
              10 Function trace
              15 Function detail
              20 Option commands
              25 SCSI/USB trace
              30 SCSI/USB writes
              31 SCSI/USB reads
              35 Useless noise

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       Flatbed units may fail to scan at maximum area, particularly at high resolution.

       Any model that does not support VPD during inquiry will not function until an override is  added  to  the
       backend.

       CCITT Fax compression used by older scanners is not supported.

       JPEG output is supported by the backend, but not by the SANE protocol, so is disabled in this release. It
       can be enabled if you rebuild from source.

       Network interfaces are not supported on any scanner model.
