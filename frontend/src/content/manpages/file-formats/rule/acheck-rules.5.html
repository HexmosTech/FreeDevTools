</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       set.rules - Rules set for acheck

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Rules set files contain rules to be check by acheck.

       Lines beginning with a number sign (`<b>#</b>') and empty lines will be ignored.  Spaces at the beginning and
       the end of a line will also be ignored as well as tabulators.  If you need spaces at the end or the
       beginning of a value you can use apostrophes (`<b>"</b>').  A comment starts with the number sign, there can be
       any number of spaces and/or tab stops in front of the #.  Long lines can be broken into multiple lines
       ending with a backslash (`<b>\</b>').  Some possible examples:

        # this line is ignored
        field    value
        field    value                               # this is a comment
        field         "value ending with space   "
        field    value\
                 continuing on the next line

       You have to escape number signs with a backslash to use it in a value and use apostrophes if a value ends
       with a backslash.

       Rule sets are made of lists of rules. Theses lists can be repeated a number of times, until or while a
       condition happens.

       A rule detects an error if the corresponding test succeeds and none of its validation tests does. Each
       rule can then produce some fixes, a warning or an error, and provide hints to help the operator to
       correct the error.

       Parts of the text can be set as comments and so no rule and no spell check will be performed on them.
