</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>radium.conf</b> - <b>radium</b> resource file.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>radium.conf</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Radium  will  open  this  radium.conf if its installed as /etc/radium.conf.  It will also search for this
       file as radium.conf in directories specified in $RADIUMPATH, or $RADIUMHOME, $RADIUMHOME/lib,  or  $HOME,
       $HOME/lib, and parse it to set common configuration options.  All values in this file can be overriden by
       command line options, or other files of this format that can be read in using the -F option.

</pre><h4><b>Variable</b> <b>Syntax</b></h4><pre>
       Variable assignments must be of the form:
         VARIABLE=
       with no white space between the VARIABLE and the '=' sign.  Quotes are optional for string arguments, but
       if you want to embed comments, then quotes are required.

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_DAEMON</b></h4><pre>
       Radium  is  capable  of  running  as  a  daemon,  doing  all the right things that daemons do.  When this
       configuration is used for the system daemon process, say for /etc/radium.conf, this  variable  should  be
       set to "yes".

       The default value is to not run as a daemon.

       This  example  is to support the ./support/Startup/radium script which requires that this variable be set
       to "yes".

       Commandline equivalent  -d

       <b>RADIUM_DAEMON=</b>no

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_MONITOR_ID</b></h4><pre>
       Radium Monitor Data is uniquely identifiable based on the source identifier  that  is  included  in  each
       output  record.   This  is  to allow you to work with Argus Data from multiple monitors at the same time.
       The ID is 32 bits long, and supports a number of formats as legitimate values. Radium  supports  unsigned
       ints, IPv4 addresses and 4 bytes strings, as values.

       The formats are discerned from the values provided.  Double-quoted values are treated as strings, and are
       truncated to 4 characters.  Non-quoted values are tested for whether they are hostnames, and if not, then
       they are tested wheter they are numbers.

       The  configuration  allows  for you to use host names, however, do have some understanding how `hostname`
       will be resolved by the nameserver before commiting to this strategy completely.

       For convenience, argus supports the notion of "`hostname`" for assigning the  probe's  id.   This  is  to
       support  management  of  large  deployments,  so you can have one argus.conf file that works for a lot of
       probes.

       For security, argus does not rely on system programs,  like  hostname.1.   It  implements  the  logic  of
       hostname itself, so don't try to run arbitrary programs using this method, because it won't work.

       Commandline equivalent   -e

       <b>RADIUM_MONITOR_ID</b>=`hostname`     // IPv4 address returned <b>RADIUM_MONITOR_ID</b>=10.2.45.3     // IPv4 address
       <b>RADIUM_MONITOR_ID</b>=2435          // Number <b>RADIUM_MONITOR_ID</b>="en0"         // String

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_ARGUS_SERVER</b></h4><pre>
       Radium can attach to any number of remote argus servers, and collect argus data in real time.  The syntax
       for this variable is a hostname or a dot notation  IP  address,  followed  by  an  optional  port  value,
       separated by a ':'.  If the port is not specified, the default value of 561 is used.

       Commandline equivalent   -S &lt;host[:port]&gt;

       <b>RADIUM_ARGUS_SERVER</b>=localhost:561

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_CISCONETFLOW_PORT</b></h4><pre>
       Radium  can  read  Cicso  Netflow  records directly from Cisco routers.  Specifying this value will alert
       Radium to open a UDP based socket listening for data from this name or address.

       Commandline equivalent   -C

       <b>RADIUM_CISCONETFLOW_PORT</b>=9996

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_USER_AUTH,</b> <b>RADIUM_AUTH_PASS</b></h4><pre>
       When argus is compiled with SASL support, ra* clients may be required to authenticate to the argus server
       before the argus will accept the  connection.   This  variable  will  allow  one  to  set  the  user  and
       authorization  id's,  if  needed.   Although  not  recommended  you  can  provide  a password through the
       RADIUM_AUTH_PASS variable.  The format for this variable is:

       Commandline equivalent   -U

       <b>RADIUM_USER_AUTH</b>=user_id/authorization_id <b>RADIUM_AUTH_PASS</b>=the_password

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_ACCESS_PORT</b></h4><pre>
       Radium monitors can provide a real-time remote access port for collecting Radium data.   This  is  a  TCP
       based  port  service  and  the  default port number is tcp/561, the "experimental monitor" service.  This
       feature is disabled by default, and can be forced off by setting it to zero (0).

       When you do want to enable this service, 561 is a good choice, as all ra* clients are configured  to  try
       this port by default.

       Commandline equivalent  -P

       <b>RADIUM_ACCESS_PORT=</b>561

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_BIND_IP</b></h4><pre>
       When  remote access is enabled (see above), you can specify that Radium should bind only to a specific IP
       address.  This is useful, for example, in restricting access to the local host, or binding to  a  private
       interface while capturing from another. The default is to bind to any IP address.

       Commandline equivalent  -B

       <b>RADIUM_BIND_IP=</b>"127.0.0.1"

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_OUTPUT_FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Radium  can  write its output to one or a number of files, default limit is 5 concurrent files, each with
       their own independant filters.

       The format is:
            RADIUM_OUTPUT_FILE=/full/path/file/name
            RADIUM_OUTPUT_FILE=/full/path/file/name "filter"

       Most sites will have radium write to a file, for reliablity and performance.  The example  file  name  is
       used  here  as  supporting  programs,  such as ./support/Archive/radiumarchive are configured to use this
       file.

       Commandline equivalent  -w

       <b>RADIUM_OUTPUT_FILE=</b>/var/log/radium/radium.out

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_SET_PID</b></h4><pre>
       When Radium is configured to run as a daemon, with the -d option, Radium can store its pid in a file,  to
       aid  in  managing  the running daemon.  However, creating a system pid file requires priviledges that may
       not be appropriate for all cases.

       When configured to generate a pid file, if Radium cannot create the pid file, it will fail to run.   This
       variable is available to override the default, in case this gets in your way.

       The default value is to generate a pid.

       No Commandline equivalent

       <b>RADIUM_SET_PID</b>=yes

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_ADJUST_TIME</b></h4><pre>
       Radium  can correct for time synchronization problems that may exist between data sources.  If configured
       to do so, radium will adjust all the timestamps in records by the calculated drift between radium and its
       many data sources.  Records whose timevalues have been 'corrected' are marked so that subsequent  readers
       can differentiate between true primitive time and modified time.

       Commandline equivalent   -T

       <b>RADIUM_ADJUST_TIME=</b>no

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_MAR_STATUS_INTERVAL</b></h4><pre>
       Radium  will  periodically report on a its own health, providing interface status, total packet and bytes
       counts, packet drop rates, and flow oriented statistics.

       These records can be used as "keep alives" for periods when there is no network traffic to be monitored.

       The default value is 300 seconds, but a value of 60 seconds is very common.

       Commandline equivalent   -M

       <b>RADIUM_MAR_STATUS_INTERVAL</b>=60

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_DEBUG_LEVEL</b></h4><pre>
       If compiled to support this option, Radium is capable of generating a lot of debug information.

       The default value is zero (0).

       Commandline equivalent  -D

       <b>RADIUM_DEBUG_LEVEL=</b>0

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_FILTER_OPTIMIZER</b></h4><pre>
       Radium uses the packet filter capabilities of libpcap.  If there is a need to not use the libpcap  filter
       optimizer, you can turn it off here.  The default is to leave it on.

       Commandline equivalent  -O

       <b>RADIUM_FILTER_OPTIMIZER=</b>yes

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_FILTER</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  provide  a  filter  expression  here,  if you like.  It should be limited to 2K in length.  The
       default is to not filter.

       No Commandline equivalent

       <b>RADIUM_FILTER=</b>""

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_CHROOT_DIR</b></h4><pre>
       Radium supports <a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</a>(2) in order to control the file system that  radium  exists  in  and  can  access.
       Generally  used when radium is running with privleges, this limits the negative impacts that radium could
       inflict on its host machine.

       This option will cause the output file names to be relative to this directory, and so consider this  when
       trying to find your output files.

       Commandline equivalent   -C

       <b>RADIUM_CHROOT_DIR=</b>""

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_SETUSER_ID</b></h4><pre>
       Radium  can  be  directed  to  change  its user id using the setuid() system call.  This is can used when
       radium is started as root, in order to access privleged resources,  but  then  after  the  resources  are
       opened,  this  directive  will  cause  radium  to change its user id value to a 'lesser' capable account.
       Recommended when radium is running as a daemon.

       Commandline equivalent   -u

       <b>RADIUM_SETUSER_ID=</b>"user"

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_SETGROUP_ID</b></h4><pre>
       Radium can be directed to change its group id using the setgid() system call.   This  is  can  used  when
       radium  is  started  as  root,  in  order to access privleged resources, but then after the resources are
       opened, this directive can be used to change argu's  group  id  value  to  a  'lesser'  capable  account.
       Recommended when radium is running as a daemon.

       Commandline equivalent   -g

       <b>RADIUM_SETGROUP_ID=</b>"group"

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_CLASSIFIER_FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Radium  can be used to label records as they are distributed.  This can be used to classify flow records,
       or simply to mark them for post processing purposes.

       When provided with a ralabel.conf formatted file, radium will label all matching records.

       Commandline equivalent   none

       <b>RADIUM_CLASSIFIER_FILE</b>=/usr/local/argus/ralabel.conf

</pre><h4><b>RADIUM_CORRELATE</b></h4><pre>
       Radium has a  correlation  function,  where  flow  data  from  multiple  source's  can  be  compared  and
       'correlateda.

       This  function  is  enabled with a single radium configuration keyword RADIUM_CORRELATE="yes".  With this
       variable set, radium().  will buffer incoming data to  generate  delay,  and  will  correlate  data  from
       multiple  sources  with  an event window of about 3 seconds.  Data that is matchable, which means that it
       has the same flow identifiers, or the same hints, will treated as if they  were  "observed"  by  multiple
       probes, and merged.

        Commandline equivalent   none

       <b>RADIUM_CORRELATE=</b>"no"
