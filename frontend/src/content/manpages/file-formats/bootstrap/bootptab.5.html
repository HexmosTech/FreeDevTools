</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bootptab - Internet Bootstrap Protocol server database

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>bootptab</u> file is the configuration database file for <b>bootpd</b>, the Internet Bootstrap Protocol server.
       It's format is similar to that of <b><a href="../man5/termcap.5.html">termcap</a></b>(5) in which two-character case-sensitive tag symbols  are  used
       to  represent  host parameters.  These parameter declarations are separated by colons (:), with a general
       format of:

            <u>hostname:tg=value...</u> <u>:tg=value...</u> <u>:tg=value.</u> <u>...</u>

       where <u>hostname</u> is the actual name of a bootp client (or a "dummy entry"), and <b>tg</b> is a  two-character  tag
       symbol.   Dummy  entries have an invalid hostname (one with a "." as the first character) and are used to
       provide default values used by other entries via  the  <b>tc=</b><u>.dummy-entry</u>  mechanism.   Most  tags  must  be
       followed  by  an  equals-sign and a value as above.  Some may also appear in a boolean form with no value
       (i.e.  :<b>tg</b>:).  The currently recognized tags are:

            bf   Bootfile
            bs   Bootfile size in 512-octet blocks
            cs   Cookie server address list
            df   Merit dump file
            dl   DHCP lease time in seconds

            hn   Send client's hostname to client
            ht   Host hardware type (see Assigned Numbers RFC)
            im   Impress server address list
            ip   Host IP address

            ns   IEN-116 name server address list
            nt   NTP (time) Server (RFC 1129)
            ra   Reply address override
            rl   Resource location protocol server address list
            rp   Root path to mount as root
            sa   TFTP server address client should use
            sm   Host subnet mask
            sw   Swap server address
            tc   Table continuation (points to similar "template" host entry)
            td   TFTP root directory used by "secure" TFTP servers
            to   Time offset in seconds from UTC
            ts   Time server address list
            vm   Vendor magic cookie selector
            yd   YP (NIS) domain name
            ys   YP (NIS) server address

       There is also a generic tag, <b>T</b><u>n</u><b>,</b> where <u>n</u> is an RFC1084 vendor field tag number.  Thus it is  possible  to
       immediately  take  advantage of future extensions to RFC1084 without being forced to modify <b>bootpd</b> first.
       Generic data may be represented as either a stream of hexadecimal numbers or as a quoted string of  ASCII
       characters.   The  length  of  the  generic data is automatically determined and inserted into the proper
       field(s) of the RFC1084-style bootp reply.

       The following tags take a whitespace-separated list of IP addresses: <b>cs</b>, <b>ds</b>, <b>gw</b>, <b>im</b>, <b>lg</b>, <b>lp</b>, <b>ns</b>, <b>nt</b>,  <b>ra</b>,
       <b>rl</b>,  and  <b>ts</b>.   The  <b>ip</b>,  <b>sa</b>,  <b>sw</b>,  <b>sm</b>,  and <b>ys</b> tags each take a single IP address.  All IP addresses are
       specified in standard Internet "dot" notation and may use decimal, octal, or hexadecimal  numbers  (octal
       numbers  begin  with 0, hexadecimal numbers begin with '0x' or '0X').  Any IP addresses may alternatively
       be specified as a  hostname,  causing  <b>bootpd</b>  to  lookup  the  IP  address  for  that  host  name  using
       <b><a href="../man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname</a>(3).</b>   If  the <b>ip</b> tag is not specified, <b>bootpd</b> will determine the IP address using the entry
       name as the host name.  (Dummy entries use an invalid host name to avoid automatic IP lookup.)

       The <b>ht</b> tag specifies the hardware type code as either an unsigned decimal, octal, or hexadecimal  integer
       or  one of the following symbolic names: <b>ethernet</b> or <b>ether</b> for 10Mb Ethernet, <b>ethernet3</b> or <b>ether3</b> for 3Mb
       experimental Ethernet, <b>ieee802</b>, <b>tr</b>, or <b>token-ring</b> for IEEE 802 networks, <b>pronet</b> for Proteon ProNET  Token
       Ring,  or <b>chaos</b>, <b>arcnet</b>, or <b>ax.25</b> for Chaos, ARCNET, and AX.25 Amateur Radio networks, respectively.  The
       <b>ha</b> tag takes a hardware address which may be specified as a host name or in numeric form.  Note that  the
       numeric form <u>must</u> be specified in hexadecimal; optional periods and/or a leading '0x' may be included for
       readability.   The <b>ha</b> tag must be preceded by the <b>ht</b> tag (either explicitly or implicitly; see <b>tc</b> below).
       If the hardware address is not specified and the type is specified as  either  "ethernet"  or  "ieee802",
       then <b>bootpd</b> will try to determine the hardware address using <b><a href="../man3/ether_hton.3.html">ether_hton</a></b>(3).

       The hostname, home directory, and bootfile are ASCII strings which may be optionally surrounded by double
       quotes  (").  The client's request and the values of the <b>hd</b> and <b>bf</b> symbols determine how the server fills
       in the bootfile field of the bootp reply packet.

       If the client provides a file name it is left as is.  Otherwise, if the <b>bf</b> option is specified its  value
       is  copied  into  the reply packet.  If the <b>hd</b> option is specified as well, its value is prepended to the
       boot file copied into the reply packet.  The existence of the boot file is checked only  if  the  <b>bs=</b><u>auto</u>
       option  is  used  (to  determine  the  boot file size).  A reply may be sent whether or not the boot file
       exists.

       Some newer versions of <b><a href="../man8/tftpd.8.html">tftpd</a></b>(8) provide a security feature to  change  their  root  directory  using  the
       <b><a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</a></b>(2)  system  call.   The <b>td</b> tag may be used to inform <b>bootpd</b> of this special root directory used by
       <b>tftpd</b>.  (One may alternatively use the <b>bootpd</b> <b>-c</b> <u>chdir</u> option.)  The <b>hd</b> tag is actually relative  to  the
       root  directory  specified  by  the  <b>td</b> tag.  For example, if the real absolute path to your BOOTP client
       bootfile is <u>/tftpboot/bootfiles/bootimage</u>, and <b>tftpd</b> uses  <u>/tftpboot</u>  as  its  "secure"  directory,  then
       specify the following in <u>bootptab</u>:

            :td=/tftpboot:hd=/bootfiles:bf=bootimage:

       If your bootfiles are located directly in /tftpboot, use:

            :td=/tftpboot:hd=/:bf=bootimage:

       The  <b>sa</b>  tag  may  be used to specify the IP address of the particular TFTP server you wish the client to
       use.  In the absence of this tag, <b>bootpd</b> will tell the client to perform TFTP to the same machine  <b>bootpd</b>
       is running on.

       The  time  offset  <b>to</b>  may be either a signed decimal integer specifying the client's time zone offset in
       seconds from UTC, or the keyword <b>auto</b> which uses the server's time zone offset.  Specifying the <b>to</b> symbol
       as a boolean has the same effect as specifying <b>auto</b> as its value.

       The bootfile size <b>bs</b> may be either a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal integer specifying the  size  of  the
       bootfile  in 512-octet blocks, or the keyword <b>auto</b> which causes the server to automatically calculate the
       bootfile size at each request.  As with the time offset, specifying the <b>bs</b> symbol as a  boolean  has  the
       same effect as specifying <b>auto</b> as its value.

       The  vendor  magic  cookie selector (the <b>vm</b> tag) may take one of the following keywords: <b>auto</b> (indicating
       that vendor information is determined by the client's request), <b>rfc1048</b> or <b>rfc1084</b> (which  always  forces
       an RFC1084-style reply), or <b>cmu</b> (which always forces a CMU-style reply).

       The  <b>hn</b>  tag  is strictly a boolean tag; it does not take the usual equals-sign and value.  It's presence
       indicates that the hostname should be sent to RFC1084  clients.   <b>Bootpd</b>  attempts  to  send  the  entire
       hostname  (including  domain) as it is specified in the configuration file; if this will not fit into the
       reply packet, the name is shortened to just the host field (up to the first period, if present) and  then
       tried.   In no case is an arbitrarily-truncated hostname sent (if nothing reasonable will fit, nothing is
       sent).

       Often, many host entries share common values for certain tags (such as name servers, etc.).  Rather  than
       repeatedly  specifying  these  tags,  a full specification can be listed for one host entry and shared by
       others via the <b>tc</b> (table continuation) mechanism.  Often, the  template  entry  is  a  dummy  host  which
       doesn't  actually  exist  and  never  sends bootp requests.  This feature is similar to the <b>tc</b> feature of
       <b><a href="../man5/termcap.5.html">termcap</a></b>(5) for similar terminals.  Note that <b>bootpd</b> allows the <b>tc</b> tag symbol to appear  anywhere  in  the
       host  entry, unlike <u>termcap</u> which requires it to be the last tag.  Information explicitly specified for a
       host always overrides information implied by a <b>tc</b> tag symbol,  regardless  of  its  location  within  the
       entry.   The value of the <b>tc</b> tag may be the hostname or IP address of any host entry previously listed in
       the configuration file.

       Sometimes it is necessary to delete a specific tag after it has been inferred via <b>tc</b>.  This can  be  done
       using the construction <u>tag</u><b>@</b> which removes the effect of <u>tag</u> as in <b><a href="../man5/termcap.5.html">termcap</a></b>(5).  For example, to completely
       undo  an  IEN-116  name  server  specification,  use ":ns@:" at an appropriate place in the configuration
       entry.  After removal with <b>@</b>, a tag is eligible to be set again through the <b>tc</b> mechanism.

       Blank lines and lines beginning with "#" are  ignored  in  the  configuration  file.   Host  entries  are
       separated  from  one  another by newlines; a single host entry may be extended over multiple lines if the
       lines end with a backslash (\).  It is also acceptable for lines to be longer than 80  characters.   Tags
       may  appear in any order, with the following exceptions:  the hostname must be the very first field in an
       entry, and the hardware type must precede the hardware address.
