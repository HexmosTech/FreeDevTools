       /etc/service-policy.d/*.pol - configuration for policy-rc.d-declarative

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/service-policy.d/*.pol</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Files in the directory <u>/etc/service-policy.d</u> are opened and parsed by the <u>policy-rc.d-declarative</u> script.
       Lines should have exactly three fields of data which are separated by whitespace; any trailing whitespace
       is ignored.

       All files are opened in order by file name; following that, all rules in a file are evaluated in order.

       The first rule that matches a given service with a given action is applied. All further rules are
       ignored.

       If no rule matches a given service with a given action, the default is to exit with exit state 100, which
       signals "unknown initscript id" to the calling update-rc.d program.

</pre><h4><b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       The file contains the following fields:

       1.  The  service(s) to which this should apply. This should be a perl regular expression that matches the
           init scripts for which this policy should be used.

       2.  The action(s) which <u>invoke-rc.d</u> wants to take. For more information on  the  available  actions,  see
           <u><a href="file:/usr/share/doc/init-system-helpers/README.policy-rc.d.gz">/usr/share/doc/init-system-helpers/README.policy-rc.d.gz</a></u>.

       3.  The policy to apply to this action. Available policies are:

           allow
               Allow the action that invoke-rc.d wants to perform without modification

           deny
               Do not allow the action.

           restart-ignore
               Replace  the  action that invoke-rc.d wants to perform by "restart stop".  That is, try a restart
               action first; if that fails for some reason, try a stop action.

               Note that at the time of this writing, not all PID1 implementations support  this.  Notably,  the
               systemd version of invoke-rc.d does not support overriding actions.
