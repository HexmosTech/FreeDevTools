</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ods-kasp</b> - OpenDNSSEC kasp specification

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/opendnssec/kasp.xml</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  kasp  file  describes the parameters of the DNSSEC Key and Signing Policy (KASP), the policy used to
       sign zones. Each policy comprises a series of parameters that define the way the zone is signed.

       <b>KASP</b> <b>Parameters</b>
              A policy has a set of common parameters to identify the policy.

       <b>Policy</b> <b>Name</b>
              The name is used to link a policy to a zone that needs to be  signed.  Each  policy  must  have  a
              unique name. The policy named "default" is special, as it is associated with all zones that do not
              have a policy explicitly associated with them.

       <b>Policy</b> <b>Description</b>
              A policy can have a description associated with it.

       <b>Signatures</b> <b>Parameters</b>
              This section lists the parameters for the signatures created using the policy.

       <b>Signature</b> <b>Resign</b> <b>Interval</b>
              This  is  the interval between runs of the signer. For example, a zone that has a Re-sign Interval
              of PT2H (2 hours) is handled by the signer every 2 hours.

       <b>Signature</b> <b>Refresh</b> <b>Interval</b>
              The Refresh Interval is describing when a  signature  should  be  refreshed.   As  signatures  are
              typically  valid for much longer than the interval between runs of the signer, there is no need to
              regenerate the signatures each time the signer is running. This means that  the  Re-sign  Interval
              must  be  smaller than the Refresh Interval.  In order to make refreshing signatures possible, the
              Re-sign Interval should be at least half of the Refresh Interval. In the case a  signer  runs  and
              detects  that  there  is  no  change  to  the  data  being signed, signatures may be refreshed.  A
              signature will be refreshed when the time until  the  signature  expiration  is  closer  than  the
              Refresh Interval.

       <b>Signature</b> <b>Validity</b>
              The Signature Validity describes how long the signatures are valid for.  This parameter groups two
              elements  of  information.  The  Default Signature Validity is the validity interval for all RRSIG
              records except those related to NSEC or NSEC3 records. For these records, the validity  period  is
              given by the value of the Denial Signature Validity.

       <b>Signature</b> <b>Jitter</b>
              The  Signature  Jitter  (j)  is  the  value  added  to  or  subtracted from the expiration time of
              signatures to ensure that not all signatures expire at the same time.  The  actual  value  of  the
              jitter  is  a  random value, uniformly ranging between Minus Signature Jitter and Signature Jitter
              [-j...j]. This value is added to Signature Validity to determine the signature expiration time.

       <b>Signature</b> <b>Inception</b> <b>Offset</b>
              This is a duration subtracted from the time at which a record is signed to give the inception time
              of the RRSIG record. This is required to allow for clock skew between the signing system  and  the
              system  on  which  the  signature is checked. Without it, the possibility exists that the checking
              system could retrieve  a  signature  whose  start  time  is  later  than  the  current  time.  The
              relationship between these elements is shown below in Figure 1.

       <b>Authenticated</b> <b>Denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>Existence</b> <b>Parameters</b>
              Authenticated  denial  of  existence  -  proving  that  domain names do not exist in the zone - is
              discussed in this section.  Below, the list of the parameters is given for creating NSEC or  NSEC3
              records using the policy.

       <b>NSEC</b> <b>or</b> <b>NSEC3</b>
              If  the  NSEC  scheme  is used to implement authenticated denial of existence, there are no record
              elements we can tune. If NSEC3 [RFC5155] is used, there are some more options.

       <b>NSEC3</b> <b>Opt-Out</b>
              Whether to enable or disable "opt-out". This is an optimisation that means that NSEC3 records  are
              only  created for authoritative data or for secure delegations; insecure delegations have no NSEC3
              records. For zones where a majority of the entries are delegations that are not signed - typically
              TLDs during the take-up phase of DNSSEC - this reduces the number of DNSSEC records in the zone.

       <b>NSEC3</b> <b>Re-salt</b> <b>Interval</b>
              The is the interval between generating new salt values for the hashing algorithm.

       <b>NSEC3</b> <b>Hash</b> <b>Parameters</b>
              The NSEC3 Hash Parameters tells parameters related to NSEC3.

       <b>NSEC3</b> <b>Hash</b> <b>Algorithm</b>
              The NSEC3 Hash Algorithm tells what hashing algorithm should be used to create the NSEC3 records.

       <b>NSEC3</b> <b>Hash</b> <b>Iterations</b>
              The NSEC3 Hash Iterations shows how many iterations of the hash function should be performed  over
              the original owner name.

       <b>NSEC3</b> <b>Hash</b> <b>Salt</b> <b>Length</b>
              The NSEC3 Hash Salt Length provides the length of the salt value to be generated.

       <b>Key</b> <b>Parameters</b>
              This section covers parameters related to keys.  There are a number of parameters relating to both
              zone-signing keys (ZSK) and key-signing keys (KSK).

       <b>DNSKEY</b> <b>TTL</b>
              This is the time-to-live value for the DNSKEY resource records.

       <b>Key</b> <b>Retire</b> <b>Safety</b>
              The  Key  Retire Safety is the retire safety margin for the keys. This interval is a safety margin
              added to calculated timing values to ensure that keys are retired without there being a chance  of
              signatures created with the keys being considered invalid.

       <b>Key</b> <b>Publish</b> <b>Safety</b>
              The  Key  Publish  is  the publish safety margins for the keys. This interval is the safety margin
              added to calculated timing values to ensure that keys are published  and  without  there  being  a
              chance of signatures created with the keys being considered invalid.

       <b>Key</b> <b>Sharing</b>
              If multiple zones are associated with a policy, a key may be shared between zones. For example, if
              you  have  100  zones  then you will only use one set of keys instead of 100 sets.  This will safe
              space in your HSM.

       <b>Key</b> <b>Purging</b> <b>Interval</b>
              Key Purging is the event where keys marked as dead (as defined  by  draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-  key-
              timing  [key-timing]) will be automatically purged from the key database. The Key Purging Interval
              is the interval of when Key Purging is done.

       <b>KSK</b> <b>Parameters</b>
              There are parameters specific for the KSK.

       <b>KSK</b> <b>Algorithm</b>
              The KSK Algorithm determines the algorithm used for KSKs.

       <b>KSK</b> <b>Lifetime</b>
              The KSK Lifetime determines how long the KSK is used for before it is must be rolled.

       <b>KSK</b> <b>Repository</b>
              The KSK Repository determines the location of the KSKs.

       <b>Manual</b> <b>KSK</b> <b>Rollover</b>
              It may be desirable to force that a key rollover will only be initiated  on  the  command  by  the
              operator. Note that if KSK rollover is done automatically, there is currently still a step for the
              KSK  that  needs  manual  intervention,  where the corresponding DS record for the key needs to be
              published to the parent before the rollover is completed.

       <b>ZSK</b> <b>Parameters</b>
              The same parameters for the KSK are available for  the  ZSK.  The  split  between  the  series  of
              parameters  is  that  with  a  ZSK/KSK  Split Signing Scheme, the values for the parameters may be
              different.

       <b>ZSK</b> <b>Algorithm</b>
              The ZSK Algorithm determines the algorithm used for ZSKs.

       <b>ZSK</b> <b>Lifetime</b>
              The ZSK Lifetime determines how long the ZSK is used for before it is must be rolled.

       <b>ZSK</b> <b>Repository</b>
              The ZSK Repository determines the location of the ZSKs.

       <b>Manual</b> <b>ZSK</b> <b>Rollover</b>
              The ZSK rollover will be fully automatic if Manual ZSK Rollover is disabled.

       <b>Zone</b> <b>Parameters</b>
              General information concerning the zones is described here.

       <b>Propagation</b> <b>Delay</b>
              The Propagation Delay is the amount of time needed for information changes at  the  master  server
              for the zone to work its way through to all the secondary nameservers.

       <b>SOA</b> <b>Parameters</b>
              These  parameters  are  necessary for maintaining the SOA record in the signed zone.  These values
              will override values set for the SOA record in the input zone.

       <b>SOA</b> <b>TTL</b>
              This is the time-to-live of the SOA record.

       <b>SOA</b> <b>MINIUM</b>
              This is value for the MINIMUM RDATA element in the SOA record.

       <b>SOA</b> <b>Serial</b>
              This represents the format of the serial number in the signed zone.  This is one of the following:
                counter:   Use an increasing counter (but use the serial from the  unsigned zone
                         if possible).

                datecounter:   Use increasing counter in YYYYMMDDxx format (xx is the number of
                               increments within each day, starting at 00).

                unixtime:   The serial number is set to the "Unix time" (seconds since 00:00 on
                            1 January 1970 (UTC)) at which the signer is run.

                keep:   Keep the serial from the unsigned zone (do not re-sign unless it has been
                        incremented).  This way, no signed zone is created unless the zone operator
                        explicitly initiated a zone update.

       <b>Parent</b> <b>Zone</b> <b>Parameters</b>
              If a DNSSEC zone is in a chain of trust, digest information about the KSKs used in the  zone  will
              be  stored  in  DS records in the parent zone. To properly roll keys, timing information about the
              parent zone must be configured.

       <b>Propagation</b> <b>Delay</b>
              The Propagation Delay parameter related to the parent zone is the interval between the time a  new
              KSK  is  published  in  the  zone  and  the time that the DS record appears in the parent zone. In
              reality, this is a variable value. The value for the Propagation Delay in the policy should  be  a
              estimate.

       <b>DS</b> <b>TTL</b> This  represents  the DS time-to-live. The DS TTL should be set to the TTL of the DS record in the
              parent zone.

       <b>SOA</b> <b>Parameters</b>
              The SOA Parameters related to the parent zone gives information about  the  parent's  SOA  record.
              These are necessary to calculate the timings in particular rollover scenarios.

       <b>SOA</b> <b>TTL</b>
              This should be set to the time-to-live of the parent zone SOA record.

       <b>SOA</b> <b>MINIUM</b>
              This should be set to the value of the MINIMUM RDATA element in the parent zone SOA record.
