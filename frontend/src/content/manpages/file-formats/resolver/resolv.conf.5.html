       resolv.conf - resolver configuration file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>resolver</u> is a set of routines in the C library that provide access to the Internet Domain Name System
       (DNS).   The  resolver  configuration file contains information that is read by the resolver routines the
       first time they are invoked by a process.  The file is designed to be human readable and contains a  list
       of  keywords  with  values that provide various types of resolver information.  The configuration file is
       considered a trusted source of DNS information; see the <b>trust-ad</b> option below for details.

       If this file does not exist, only the name server on the local machine will be queried,  and  the  search
       list contains the local domain name determined from the hostname.

       The different configuration options are:

       <b>nameserver</b> Name server IP address
              Internet  address  of a name server that the resolver should query, either an IPv4 address (in dot
              notation), or an IPv6 address in colon (and possibly dot) notation as per RFC 2373.  Up  to  <b>MAXNS</b>
              (currently  3, see <u>&lt;resolv.h&gt;</u>) name servers may be listed, one per keyword.  If there are multiple
              servers, the resolver library queries them in the order listed.   If  no  <b>nameserver</b>  entries  are
              present,  the  default  is to use the name server on the local machine.  (The algorithm used is to
              try a name server, and if the query times out, try the next,  until  out  of  name  servers,  then
              repeat trying all the name servers until a maximum number of retries are made.)

       <b>search</b> Search list for host-name lookup.
              By  default, the search list contains one entry, the local domain name.  It is determined from the
              local hostname returned by <b><a href="../man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname</a></b>(2); the local domain name is taken to be  everything  after
              the first '.'.  Finally, if the hostname does not contain a '.', the root domain is assumed as the
              local domain name.

              This  may  be  changed by listing the desired domain search path following the <u>search</u> keyword with
              spaces or tabs separating the names.  Resolver queries having fewer than <u>ndots</u> dots (default is 1)
              in them will be attempted using each component of the search path in turn until a match is  found.
              For  environments  with multiple subdomains please read <b>options</b> <b>ndots:</b><u>n</u> below to avoid man-in-the-
              middle attacks and unnecessary traffic for the root-dns-servers.  Note that this  process  may  be
              slow  and  will  generate  a  lot of network traffic if the servers for the listed domains are not
              local, and that queries will time out if no server is available for one of the domains.

              If there are multiple <b>search</b> directives, only the search list from the last instance is used.

              In glibc 2.25 and earlier, the search list  is  limited  to  six  domains  with  a  total  of  256
              characters.  Since glibc 2.26, the search list is unlimited.

              The  <b>domain</b>  directive  is  an obsolete name for the <b>search</b> directive that handles one search list
              entry only.

       <b>sortlist</b>
              This option allows addresses returned by <b><a href="../man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname</a></b>(3) to be sorted.  A sortlist  is  specified
              by  IP-address-netmask  pairs.  The netmask is optional and defaults to the natural netmask of the
              net.  The IP address and optional network pairs are separated by slashes.  Up to 10 pairs  may  be
              specified.  Here is an example:

                  sortlist 130.155.160.0/255.255.240.0 130.155.0.0

       <b>options</b>
              Options allows certain internal resolver variables to be modified.  The syntax is

                     <b>options</b> <u>option</u> <u>...</u>

              where <u>option</u> is one of the following:

              <b>debug</b>  Sets  <b>RES_DEBUG</b>  in <b>_</b><u>res.options</u> (effective only if glibc was built with debug support; see
                     <b><a href="../man3/resolver.3.html">resolver</a></b>(3)).

              <b>ndots:</b><u>n</u>
                     Sets a threshold for the number of dots which must appear in a name given  to  <b><a href="../man3/res_query.3.html">res_query</a></b>(3)
                     (see  <b><a href="../man3/resolver.3.html">resolver</a></b>(3))  before an <u>initial</u> <u>absolute</u> <u>query</u> will be made.  The default for <u>n</u> is 1,
                     meaning that if there are any dots in a name, the name will be tried first as  an  absolute
                     name  before  any  <u>search</u>  <u>list</u>  elements are appended to it.  The value for this option is
                     silently capped to 15.

              <b>timeout:</b><u>n</u>
                     Sets the amount of time the resolver will wait for a response from  a  remote  name  server
                     before  retrying  the  query  via  a different name server.  This may <b>not</b> be the total time
                     taken by any resolver API call and there is no guarantee that a single  resolver  API  call
                     maps  to  a  single timeout.  Measured in seconds, the default is <b>RES_TIMEOUT</b> (currently 5,
                     see <u>&lt;resolv.h&gt;</u>).  The value for this option is silently capped to 30.

              <b>attempts:</b><u>n</u>
                     Sets the number of times the resolver will send a query to its name servers  before  giving
                     up  and  returning  an  error  to  the  calling  application.   The default is <b>RES_DFLRETRY</b>
                     (currently 2, see <u>&lt;resolv.h&gt;</u>).  The value for this option is silently capped to 5.

              <b>rotate</b> Sets <b>RES_ROTATE</b> in <b>_</b><u>res.options</u>, which causes round-robin selection of  name  servers  from
                     among  those  listed.   This  has  the  effect of spreading the query load among all listed
                     servers, rather than having all clients try the first listed server first every time.

              <b>no-aaaa</b> <b>(since</b> <b>glibc</b> <b>2.36)</b>
                     Sets <b>RES_NOAAAA</b> in <b>_</b><u>res.options</u>, which suppresses AAAA queries made by the  stub  resolver,
                     including  AAAA lookups triggered by NSS-based interfaces such as <b><a href="../man3/getaddrinfo.3.html">getaddrinfo</a></b>(3).  Only DNS
                     lookups are affected: IPv6 data in <b><a href="../man5/hosts.5.html">hosts</a></b>(5) is still used, <b><a href="../man3/getaddrinfo.3.html">getaddrinfo</a></b>(3)  with  <b>AI_PASSIVE</b>
                     will  still  produce  IPv6  addresses, and configured IPv6 name servers are still used.  To
                     produce correct Name Error (NXDOMAIN) results, AAAA queries are translated  to  A  queries.
                     This  option  is  intended  preliminary  for diagnostic purposes, to rule out that AAAA DNS
                     queries have adverse impact.  It is incompatible with EDNS0 usage and DNSSEC validation  by
                     applications.

              <b>no-check-names</b>
                     Sets  <b>RES_NOCHECKNAME</b>  in <b>_</b><u>res.options</u>, which disables the modern BIND checking of incoming
                     hostnames and mail names for invalid characters  such  as  underscore  (_),  non-ASCII,  or
                     control characters.

              <b>inet6</b>  Sets  <b>RES_USE_INET6</b> in <b>_</b><u>res.options</u>.  This has the effect of trying an AAAA query before an
                     A query inside the <b><a href="../man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname</a></b>(3)  function,  and  of  mapping  IPv4  responses  in  IPv6
                     "tunneled form" if no AAAA records are found but an A record set exists.  Since glibc 2.25,
                     this   option   is   deprecated;   applications  should  use  <b><a href="../man3/getaddrinfo.3.html">getaddrinfo</a></b>(3),  rather  than
                     <b><a href="../man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname</a></b>(3).

              Some programs behave strangely when this option is turned on.

              <b>ip6-bytestring</b> (since glibc 2.3.4 to glibc 2.24)
                     Sets <b>RES_USEBSTRING</b> in <b>_</b><u>res.options</u>.  This causes reverse IPv6 lookups to be made using the
                     bit-label format described in RFC 2673; if this option is not set (which is  the  default),
                     then  nibble  format  is used.  This option was removed in glibc 2.25, since it relied on a
                     backward-incompatible DNS extension that was never deployed on the Internet.

              <b>ip6-dotint</b>/<b>no-ip6-dotint</b> (glibc 2.3.4 to glibc 2.24)
                     Clear/set <b>RES_NOIP6DOTINT</b> in <b>_</b><u>res.options</u>.  When this option is clear (<b>ip6-dotint</b>), reverse
                     IPv6 lookups  are  made  in  the  (deprecated)  <u>ip6.int</u>  zone;  when  this  option  is  set
                     (<b>no-ip6-dotint</b>),  reverse  IPv6  lookups  are  made in the <u>ip6.arpa</u> zone by default.  These
                     options are available up  to  glibc  2.24,  where  <b>no-ip6-dotint</b>  is  the  default.   Since
                     <b>ip6-dotint</b>  support  long  ago  ceased  to be available on the Internet, these options were
                     removed in glibc 2.25.

              <b>edns0</b> (since glibc 2.6)
                     Sets <b>RES_USE_EDNS0</b> in <b>_</b><u>res.options</u>.  This enables support for the DNS extensions  described
                     in RFC 2671.

              <b>single-request</b> (since glibc 2.10)
                     Sets  <b>RES_SNGLKUP</b>  in  <b>_</b><u>res.options</u>.   By  default, glibc performs IPv4 and IPv6 lookups in
                     parallel since glibc 2.9.  Some appliance DNS servers cannot handle these queries  properly
                     and  make the requests time out.  This option disables the behavior and makes glibc perform
                     the IPv6 and IPv4 requests sequentially (at the cost of  some  slowdown  of  the  resolving
                     process).

              <b>single-request-reopen</b> (since glibc 2.9)
                     Sets <b>RES_SNGLKUPREOP</b> in <b>_</b><u>res.options</u>.  The resolver uses the same socket for the A and AAAA
                     requests.   Some  hardware  mistakenly  sends  back  only one reply.  When that happens the
                     client system will sit and wait for the second reply.  Turning this option on changes  this
                     behavior so that if two requests from the same port are not handled correctly it will close
                     the socket and open a new one before sending the second request.

              <b>no-tld-query</b> (since glibc 2.14)
                     Sets  <b>RES_NOTLDQUERY</b>  in  <b>_</b><u>res.options</u>.  This option causes <b>res_nsearch</b>() to not attempt to
                     resolve an unqualified name as if it were a top level domain (TLD).  This option can  cause
                     problems if the site has ``localhost'' as a TLD rather than having localhost on one or more
                     elements  of  the  search  list.   This  option  has  no  effect if neither RES_DEFNAMES or
                     RES_DNSRCH is set.

              <b>use-vc</b> (since glibc 2.14)
                     Sets <b>RES_USEVC</b> in <b>_</b><u>res.options</u>.  This option forces the use of TCP for DNS resolutions.

              <b>no-reload</b> (since glibc 2.26)
                     Sets <b>RES_NORELOAD</b> in <b>_</b><u>res.options</u>.  This option disables automatic reloading of  a  changed
                     configuration file.

              <b>trust-ad</b> (since glibc 2.31)
                     Sets  <b>RES_TRUSTAD</b>  in  <b>_</b><u>res.options</u>.   This option controls the AD bit behavior of the stub
                     resolver.  If a validating resolver sets the AD bit in a response, it  indicates  that  the
                     data  in  the  response was verified according to the DNSSEC protocol.  In order to rely on
                     the AD bit, the local system has to trust  both  the  DNSSEC-validating  resolver  and  the
                     network path to it, which is why an explicit opt-in is required.  If the <b>trust-ad</b> option is
                     active,  the  stub  resolver  sets  the  AD  bit  in outgoing DNS queries (to enable AD bit
                     support), and preserves the AD bit in responses.  Without this option, the AD  bit  is  not
                     set  in  queries,  and  it is always removed from responses before they are returned to the
                     application.  This means that applications can  trust  the  AD  bit  in  responses  if  the
                     <b>trust-ad</b> option has been set correctly.

                     In  glibc  2.30  and  earlier,  the  AD  is not set automatically in queries, and is passed
                     through unchanged to applications in responses.

       The <u>search</u> keyword of a system's <u>resolv.conf</u> file can be overridden on a per-process basis by setting the
       environment variable <b>LOCALDOMAIN</b> to a space-separated list of search domains.

       The <u>options</u> keyword of a system's <u>resolv.conf</u> file can be amended on a per-process basis by  setting  the
       environment  variable  <b>RES_OPTIONS</b> to a space-separated list of resolver options as explained above under
       <b>options</b>.

       The keyword and value must appear on a single line, and the keyword (e.g.,  <b>nameserver</b>)  must  start  the
       line.  The value follows the keyword, separated by white space.

       Lines that contain a semicolon (;) or hash character (#) in the first column are treated as comments.
