       cmap - format of .cmap files (color maps)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Color-map  files  define  the mapping between eight-bit color numbers and red, green and blue intensities
       used for those numbers.  They are read by Magic as part of system startup, and  also  by  the  <b>:load</b>  and
       <b>:save</b>  commands in color-map windows.  Color-map file names usually have the form <u>x</u><b>.</b><u>y</u><b>.</b><u>z</u><b>.cmap</b><u>n</u>, where <u>x</u> is
       a class of technology files, <u>y</u> is a class of displays, <u>z</u> is a class of  monitors,  and  <u>n</u>  is  a  version
       number (currently <b>1</b>).  The version number will change in the future if the format of color-map files ever
       changes.  Normally, <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> correspond to the corresponding parts of a display styles file.  For example,
       the  color  map  file  <b>mos.7bit.std.cmap1</b>  is  used  today  for most nMOS and CMOS technology files using
       displays that support at least seven  bits  of  color  per  pixel  and  standard-phosphor  monitors.   It
       corresponds to the display styles file <b>mos.7bit.dstyle5</b>.

       Color-map  files  are  stored in ASCII form, with each line containing four decimal integers separated by
       white space.  The first three integers are red, green, and blue intensities, and the fourth  field  is  a
       color  number.   For  current  displays  the  intensities  must be integers between 0 and 255.  The color
       numbers must increase from line to line, and the last line must have a color number  of  255.   The  red,
       green,  and  blue  intensities  on  the first line are used for all colors from 0 up to and including the
       color number on that line.  For other lines, the intensities  on  that  line  are  used  for  all  colors
       starting  one  color  above the color number on the previous line and continuing up and through the color
       number on the current line.  For example, consider the color map below:

       255     0       0       2
       0       0       255     3
       255     255     255     256

       This color map indicates that colors 0, 1, and 2 are to be red, color 3 is to  be  blue,  and  all  other
       colors are to be white.
