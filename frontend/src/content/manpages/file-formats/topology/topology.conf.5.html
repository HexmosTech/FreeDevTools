</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       topology.conf -  Slurm configuration file for the topology plugins

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>topology.conf</b>  is an ASCII file which describes the cluster's network topology for optimized job resource
       allocation.  The file will always be located in the same directory as the <b>slurm.conf</b>.

       Parameter names are case insensitive.  Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated as a
       comment through the end of that line.  Changes to the configuration file  take  effect  upon  restart  of
       Slurm  daemons,  daemon  receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution of the command "scontrol reconfigure"
       unless otherwise noted.

</pre><h4><b>topology/tree</b></h4><pre>
       This plugin requires you to use the select/cons_tres plugin.  The network  topology  configuration,  each
       line  defining  a  switch  name  and  its  children, either node names or switch names.  Slurm's hostlist
       expression  parser  is  used,  so  the  node  and  switch   names   need   not   be   consecutive   (e.g.
       "Nodes=tux[0-3,12,18-20]" and "Switches=s[0-2,4-8,12]" will parse fine).  An optional link speed may also
       be specified.

       All nodes in the network must be connected to at least one switch. The network must be fully connected to
       use  <b>TopologyParam=RouteTree</b>. Jobs can only span nodes connected by the same switch fabric, even if there
       are available idle nodes in other areas of the cluster.

       The <b>topology.conf</b> file for an Infiniband switch can be automatically generated using the  <b>slurmibtopology</b>
       tool found here: &lt;https://github.com/OleHolmNielsen/Slurm_tools/tree/master/slurmibtopology&gt;.

       The overall configuration parameters available for topology/tree include:

       <b>SwitchName</b>
              The  name  of  a  switch. This name is internal to Slurm and arbitrary.  Each switch should have a
              unique name.  This field must be specified and cannot be longer than 64 characters.

       <b>Switches</b>
              Child switches of the named switch.  Either this option or the <b>Nodes</b> option must be specified.

       <b>Nodes</b>  Child Nodes of the named leaf  switch.   Either  this  option  or  the  <b>Switches</b>  option  must  be
              specified.

       <b>LinkSpeed</b>
              An  optional  value  specifying  the  performance  of this communication link.  The units used are
              arbitrary and this information is currently not used.  It may be used in the  future  to  optimize
              resource allocations.

</pre><h4><b>topology/block</b></h4><pre>
       The network topology configuration, each line defining a block name and its children node names.  Slurm's
       hostlist   expression   parser   is   used,   so   the   node   names   need  not  be  consecutive  (e.g.
       "Nodes=tux[0-3,12,18-20]").

       This topology plugin places emphasis on reducing fragmentation of the  cluster,  allowing  jobs  to  take
       advantage  of  lower-latency  connections  between smaller "blocks" of node, rather than starting jobs as
       quickly as possible on the first available resources.

       Defined blocks of nodes are paired with other contiguous blocks, to create a higher level block of nodes.
       These larger blocks can then be paired with other blocks at the same level for bigger and  bigger  blocks
       of  contiguous  nodes  with optimized communication between them. The enforced block sizes are defined by
       <b>BlockSizes</b>.

       The overall configuration parameters available for topology/block include:

       <b>BlockName</b>
              The name of a block. This name is internal to Slurm and  arbitrary.   Each  block  should  have  a
              unique name.  This field must be specified.

       <b>Nodes</b>  Child Nodes of the named block.  This must be specified along with the <b>BlockName</b>.

       <b>BlockSizes</b>
              List  of  the  planning  base  block  size,  alongside  any higher-level block sizes that would be
              enforced.  Each block must have at least the planning base block size count of nodes.   Successive
              BlockSizes must be a power of two larger than the prior values.
