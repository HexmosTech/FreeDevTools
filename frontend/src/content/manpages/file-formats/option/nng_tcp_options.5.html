       nng_tcp_options - TCP-specific options

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           #include &lt;nng/nng.h&gt;

           #define NNG_OPT_TCP_NODELAY    "tcp-nodelay"
           #define NNG_OPT_TCP_KEEPALIVE  "tcp-keepalive"
           #define NNG_OPT_TCP_BOUND_PORT "tcp-bound-port"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This page documents the various standard options that can be set or retrieved on objects using TCP.

       The option names should always be used by their symbolic definitions.

       In the following list of options, the name of the option is supplied, along with the data type of the
       underlying value.

       Some options are only meaningful or supported in certain contexts, or may have other access restrictions.
       An attempt has been made to include details about such restrictions in the description of the option.

       The following options are generally application to objects making use of TCP/IP communications.

   <b>TCP</b> <b>Options</b>
       NNG_OPT_TCP_NODELAY
           (bool) This option is used to disable (or enable) the use of Nagle’s algorithm for TCP connections.

               <b>Note</b>

               This setting may apply to transports that are built on top of TCP. See the transport
               documentation for each transport for details.

           When true (the default), messages are sent immediately by the underlying TCP stream without waiting
           to gather more data.

           When false, Nagle’s algorithm is enabled, and the TCP stream may wait briefly in attempt to coalesce
           messages. Nagle’s algorithm is useful on low-bandwidth connections to reduce overhead, but it comes
           at a cost to latency.

           When used on a dialer or a listener, the value affects how newly created connections will be
           configured.

       NNG_OPT_TCP_KEEPALIVE
           (bool) This option is used to enable the sending of keep-alive messages on the underlying TCP stream.
           This option is false by default.

               <b>Note</b>

               This setting may apply to transports that are built on top of TCP. See the transport
               documentation for each transport for details.

           When enabled, if no messages are seen for a period of time, then a zero length TCP message is sent
           with the ACK flag set in an attempt to tickle some traffic from the peer. If none is still seen
           (after some platform-specific number of retries and timeouts), then the remote peer is presumed dead,
           and the connection is closed.

           When used on a dialer or a listener, the value affects how newly created connections will be
           configured.

               <b>Tip</b>

               This option has two purposes. First, it can be used to detect dead peers on an otherwise
               quiescent network. Second, it can be used to keep connection table entries in NAT and other
               middleware from being expiring due to lack of activity.

       NNG_OPT_TCP_BOUND_PORT
           (int) This option is available on listeners, after the listern has bound to a port, and provides the
           port bound to in native byte order. This is most useful when using a listener with an ephemeral port
           (configured by using port 0 at configuration time), as it allows the caller to determine the actual
           ephemeral port that was chosen by the system. While the value is of type int, it will be a legal TCP
           port number, that is a value between 1 and 65535, inclusive.

   <b>Inherited</b> <b>Options</b>
       Generally, the following option values are also available for TCP objects, when appropriate for the
       context:

       •   NNG_OPT_LOCADDR

       •   NNG_OPT_REMADDR
