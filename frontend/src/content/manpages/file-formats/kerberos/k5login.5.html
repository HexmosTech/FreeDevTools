       k5login - Kerberos V5 acl file for host access

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  .k5login file, which resides in a user's home directory, contains a list of the Kerberos principals.
       Anyone with valid tickets for a principal in the file is allowed host access with the UID of the user  in
       whose  home  directory  the  file  resides.   One  common  use is to place a .k5login file in root's home
       directory, thereby granting system administrators remote root access to the host via Kerberos.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Suppose the user <b>alice</b> had a .k5login file in her home directory containing just the following line:

          <a href="mailto:bob@FOOBAR.ORG">bob@FOOBAR.ORG</a>

       This would allow <b>bob</b> to use Kerberos network applications, such as <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a>(1),  to  access  <b>alice</b>'s  account,
       using  <b>bob</b>'s  Kerberos  tickets.   In  a default configuration (with <b>k5login_authoritative</b> set to true in
       <a href="../man5/krb5.conf.5.html">krb5.conf</a>(5)), this .k5login file would not let <b>alice</b>  use  those  network  applications  to  access  her
       account,  since  she is not listed!  With no .k5login file, or with <b>k5login_authoritative</b> set to false, a
       default rule would permit the principal <b>alice</b> in the machine's default realm to access the <b>alice</b> account.

       Let us further suppose that <b>alice</b> is a system administrator.  Alice and the other  system  administrators
       would have their principals in root's .k5login file on each host:

          <a href="mailto:alice@BLEEP.COM">alice@BLEEP.COM</a>

          joeadmin/<a href="mailto:root@BLEEP.COM">root@BLEEP.COM</a>

       This  would  allow  either  system  administrator  to  log in to these hosts using their Kerberos tickets
       instead of having to type the root password.  Note that because <b>bob</b> retains the Kerberos tickets for  his
       own principal, <b><a href="mailto:bob@FOOBAR.ORG">bob@FOOBAR.ORG</a></b>, he would not have any of the privileges that require <b>alice</b>'s tickets, such
       as root access to any of the site's hosts, or the ability to change <b>alice</b>'s password.
