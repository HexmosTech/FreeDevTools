       slapo-chain - chain overlay to slapd

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/ldap/slapd.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>chain</b> overlay to <b><a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd</a></b>(8) allows automatic referral chasing.  Any time a referral is returned (except
       for bind operations), it is chased by using an instance of the ldap backend.  If operations are performed
       with  an identity (i.e. after a bind), that identity can be asserted while chasing the referrals by means
       of the <u>identity</u> <u>assertion</u> feature of back-ldap (see <b><a href="../man5/slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap</a></b>(5)  for  details),  which  is  essentially
       based  on the <b>proxied</b> <b>authorization</b> control [RFC 4370].  Referral chasing can be controlled by the client
       by issuing the <b>chaining</b> control (see <u>draft-sermersheim-ldap-chaining</u> for details.)

       The config directives that are specific to the <b>chain</b> overlay are prefixed by <b>chain-</b>, to  avoid  potential
       conflicts with directives specific to the underlying database or to other stacked overlays.

       There are very few chain overlay specific directives; however, directives related to the instances of the
       <u>ldap</u> backend that may be implicitly instantiated by the overlay may assume a special meaning when used in
       conjunction with this overlay.  They are described in <b><a href="../man5/slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap</a></b>(5), and they also need to be prefixed by
       <b>chain-</b>.

       Note: this overlay is built into the <u>ldap</u> backend; it is not a separate module.

       <b>overlay</b> <b>chain</b>
              This  directive adds the chain overlay to the current backend.  The chain overlay may be used with
              any backend, but it is mainly intended for  use  with  local  storage  backends  that  may  return
              referrals.   It is useless in conjunction with the <u>slapd-ldap</u> and <u>slapd-meta</u> backends because they
              already exploit the libldap specific referral chase  feature.   [Note:  this  may  change  in  the
              future, as the <b><a href="../man5/ldap.5.html">ldap</a></b>(5) and <b><a href="../man5/meta.5.html">meta</a></b>(5) backends might no longer chase referrals on their own.]

       <b>chain-cache-uri</b> <b>{FALSE|true}</b>
              This  directive  instructs  the <u>chain</u> overlay to cache connections to URIs parsed out of referrals
              that are not predefined, to be reused for later  chaining.   These  URIs  inherit  the  properties
              configured  for  the  underlying  <b><a href="../man5/slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap</a></b>(5)  before any occurrence of the <b>chain-uri</b> directive;
              basically, they are chained anonymously.

       <b>chain-chaining</b> <b>[resolve=&lt;r&gt;]</b> <b>[continuation=&lt;c&gt;]</b> <b>[critical]</b>
              This directive enables the <u>chaining</u> control (see <u>draft-sermersheim-ldap-chaining</u> for details) with
              the desired resolve and continuation behaviors and criticality.  The <b>resolve</b> parameter  refers  to
              the  behavior  while  discovering  a  resource,  namely when accessing the object indicated by the
              request DN; the  <b>continuation</b>  parameter  refers  to  the  behavior  while  handling  intermediate
              responses,  which  is  mostly  significant  for  the  search  operation,  but  may affect extended
              operations  that  return  intermediate  responses.   The  values  <b>r</b>  and   <b>c</b>   can   be   any   of
              <b>chainingPreferred</b>,  <b>chainingRequired</b>, <b>referralsPreferred</b>, <b>referralsRequired</b>.  If the <b>critical</b> flag
              affects the control criticality if provided.  [This control is experimental and  its  support  may
              change in the future.]

       <b>chain-max-depth</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              In  case a referral is returned during referral chasing, further chasing occurs at most <b>&lt;n&gt;</b> levels
              deep.  Set to <b>1</b> (the default) to disable further referral chasing.

       <b>chain-return-error</b> <b>{FALSE|true}</b>
              In case referral chasing fails, the real error is returned instead of the original  referral.   In
              case  multiple referral URIs are present, only the first error is returned.  This behavior may not
              be always appropriate nor desirable, since failures in referral chasing might be  better  resolved
              by the client (e.g. when caused by distributed authentication issues).

       <b>chain-uri</b> <b>&lt;ldapuri&gt;</b>
              This  directive  instantiates  a  new underlying <u>ldap</u> database and instructs it about which URI to
              contact to chase referrals.  As opposed to what stated in <b><a href="../man5/slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap</a></b>(5), only one URI  can  appear
              after  this  directive;  all  subsequent <b><a href="../man5/slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap</a></b>(5) directives prefixed by <b>chain-</b> refer to this
              specific instance of a remote server.

       Directives for configuring the underlying ldap database may also be required, as shown in this example:

              overlay                 chain
              chain-rebind-as-user    FALSE

              chain-uri               "ldap://ldap1.example.com"
              chain-rebind-as-user    TRUE
              chain-idassert-bind     bindmethod="simple"
                                      binddn="cn=Auth,dc=example,dc=com"
                                      credentials="secret"
                                      mode="self"

              chain-uri               "ldap://ldap2.example.com"
              chain-idassert-bind     bindmethod="simple"
                                      binddn="cn=Auth,dc=example,dc=com"
                                      credentials="secret"
                                      mode="none"

       Any valid directives for the ldap  database  may  be  used;  see  <b><a href="../man5/slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap</a></b>(5)  for  details.   Multiple
       occurrences  of  the  <b>chain-uri</b>  directive may appear, to define multiple "trusted" URIs where operations
       with <u>identity</u> <u>assertion</u> are chained.  All URIs not listed in the configuration are  chained  anonymously.
       All  <b><a href="../man5/slapd-ldap.5.html">slapd-ldap</a></b>(5)  directives  appearing  before  the first occurrence of <b>chain-uri</b> are inherited by all
       URIs, unless specifically overridden inside each URI configuration.
