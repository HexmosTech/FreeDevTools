</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       access - Postfix SMTP server access table

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>postmap</b> <b>/etc/postfix/access</b>

       <b>postmap</b> <b>-q</b> <b>"</b><u>string</u><b>"</b> <b>/etc/postfix/access</b>

       <b>postmap</b> <b>-q</b> <b>-</b> <b>/etc/postfix/access</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>inputfile</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  document describes access control on remote SMTP client information: host names, network addresses,
       and envelope sender or  recipient  addresses;  it  is  implemented  by  the  Postfix  SMTP  server.   See
       <b><a href="../man5/header_checks.5.html">header_checks</a></b>(5) or <b><a href="../man5/body_checks.5.html">body_checks</a></b>(5) for access control on the content of email messages.

       Normally, the <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) table is specified as a text file that serves as input to the <b><a href="../man1/postmap.1.html">postmap</a></b>(1) command.
       The  result,  an indexed file in <b>dbm</b> or <b>db</b> format, is used for fast searching by the mail system. Execute
       the command "<b>postmap</b> <b>/etc/postfix/access</b>" to rebuild an indexed file  after  changing  the  corresponding
       text file.

       When  the  table  is  provided via other means such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, the same lookups are done as for
       ordinary indexed files.

       Alternatively, the table can be provided as a regular-expression map where patterns are given as  regular
       expressions,  or lookups can be directed to a TCP-based server. In those cases, the lookups are done in a
       slightly different way as described below under "REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES" or "TCP-BASED TABLES".

</pre><h4><b>CASE</b> <b>FOLDING</b></h4><pre>
       The search string is folded to lowercase before database lookup. As of Postfix 2.3, the search string  is
       not case folded with database types such as regexp: or pcre: whose lookup fields can match both upper and
       lower case.

</pre><h4><b>TABLE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The input format for the <b><a href="../man1/postmap.1.html">postmap</a></b>(1) command is as follows:

       <u>pattern</u> <u>action</u>
              When <u>pattern</u> matches a mail address, domain or host address, perform the corresponding <u>action</u>.

       blank lines and comments
              Empty  lines  and  whitespace-only  lines  are  ignored,  as  are lines whose first non-whitespace
              character is a `#'.

       multi-line text
              A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that starts  with  whitespace  continues  a
              logical line.

</pre><h4><b>EMAIL</b> <b>ADDRESS</b> <b>PATTERNS</b> <b>IN</b> <b>INDEXED</b> <b>TABLES</b></h4><pre>
       With  lookups  from  indexed  files such as DB or DBM, or from networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL,
       patterns are tried in the order as listed below:

       <u>user</u>@<u>domain</u>
              Matches the specified mail address.

       <u>domain.tld</u>
              Matches <u>domain.tld</u> as the domain part of an email address.

              The pattern <u>domain.tld</u> also matches subdomains, but only  when  the  string  <b>smtpd_access_maps</b>  is
              listed in the Postfix <b>parent_domain_matches_subdomains</b> configuration setting.

       <u>.domain.tld</u>
              Matches  subdomains of <u>domain.tld</u>, but only when the string <b>smtpd_access_maps</b> is not listed in the
              Postfix <b>parent_domain_matches_subdomains</b> configuration setting.

       <u>user</u>@  Matches all mail addresses with the specified user part.

       Note: lookup of the null sender address is not possible with some types  of  lookup  table.  By  default,
       Postfix   uses   <b>&lt;&gt;</b>   as   the   lookup  key  for  such  addresses.  The  value  is  specified  with  the
       <b>smtpd_null_access_lookup_key</b> parameter in the Postfix <b>main.cf</b> file.

</pre><h4><b>EMAIL</b> <b>ADDRESS</b> <b>EXTENSION</b></h4><pre>
       When a mail address localpart contains the optional  recipient  delimiter  (e.g.,  <u>user+foo</u>@<u>domain</u>),  the
       lookup order becomes: <u>user+foo</u>@<u>domain</u>, <u>user</u>@<u>domain</u>, <u>domain</u>, <u>user+foo</u>@, and <u>user</u>@.

</pre><h4><b>HOST</b> <b>NAME/ADDRESS</b> <b>PATTERNS</b> <b>IN</b> <b>INDEXED</b> <b>TABLES</b></h4><pre>
       With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, the
       following lookup patterns are examined in the order as listed:

       <u>domain.tld</u>
              Matches <u>domain.tld</u>.

              The  pattern  <u>domain.tld</u>  also  matches  subdomains, but only when the string <b>smtpd_access_maps</b> is
              listed in the Postfix <b>parent_domain_matches_subdomains</b> configuration setting.

       <u>.domain.tld</u>
              Matches subdomains of <u>domain.tld</u>, but only when the string <b>smtpd_access_maps</b> is not listed in  the
              Postfix <b>parent_domain_matches_subdomains</b> configuration setting.

       <u>net.work.addr.ess</u>

       <u>net.work.addr</u>

       <u>net.work</u>

       <u>net</u>    Matches  a  remote IPv4 host address or network address range.  Specify one to four decimal octets
              separated by ".". Do not specify "[]" , "/", leading zeros, or hexadecimal forms.

              Network ranges are matched by repeatedly truncating the last ".octet"  from  a  remote  IPv4  host
              address  string,  until  a  match is found in the access table, or until further truncation is not
              possible.

              NOTE: use the <b>cidr</b> lookup table type to specify network/netmask patterns.  See  <b><a href="../man5/cidr_table.5.html">cidr_table</a></b>(5)  for
              details.

       <u>net:work:addr:ess</u>

       <u>net:work:addr</u>

       <u>net:work</u>

       <u>net</u>    Matches  a  remote IPv6 host address or network address range.  Specify three to eight hexadecimal
              octet pairs separated by ":", using the compressed form "::" for a sequence of  zero-valued  octet
              pairs. Do not specify "[]", "/", leading zeros, or non-compressed forms.

              A network range is matched by repeatedly truncating the last ":octetpair" from the compressed-form
              remote  IPv6  host  address  string,  until a match is found in the access table, or until further
              truncation is not possible.

              NOTE: use the <b>cidr</b> lookup table type to specify network/netmask patterns.  See  <b><a href="../man5/cidr_table.5.html">cidr_table</a></b>(5)  for
              details.

              IPv6 support is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>ACCEPT</b> <b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>OK</b>     Accept the address etc. that matches the pattern.

       <u>all-numerical</u>
              An  all-numerical  result  is  treated  as  OK.  This  format  is generated by address-based relay
              authorization schemes such as pop-before-smtp.

       For other accept actions, see "OTHER ACTIONS" below.

</pre><h4><b>REJECT</b> <b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Postfix version 2.3 and later support enhanced status codes as defined in RFC  3463.   When  no  code  is
       specified  at  the beginning of the <u>text</u> below, Postfix inserts a default enhanced status code of "5.7.1"
       in the case of reject actions, and "4.7.1" in the case of defer  actions.  See  "ENHANCED  STATUS  CODES"
       below.

       <b>4</b><u>NN</u> <u>text</u>

       <b>5</b><u>NN</u> <u>text</u>
              Reject  the address etc. that matches the pattern, and respond with the numerical three-digit code
              and text. <b>4</b><u>NN</u> means "try again later", while <b>5</b><u>NN</u> means "do not try again".

              The following responses have special meaning for the Postfix SMTP server:

              <b>421</b> <u>text</u> (Postfix 2.3 and later)

              <b>521</b> <u>text</u> (Postfix 2.6 and later)
                     After responding with the numerical three-digit code and text, disconnect immediately  from
                     the SMTP client.  This frees up SMTP server resources so that they can be made available to
                     another SMTP client.

                     Note:  The  "521"  response  should  be  used  only  with  botnets  and other malware where
                     interoperability is of no concern.  The "send 521 and disconnect" behavior is  NOT  defined
                     in the SMTP standard.

       <b>REJECT</b> <u>optional</u> <u>text...</u>
              Reject  the  address  etc.  that matches the pattern. Reply with "<b>$access_map_reject_code</b> <u>optional</u>
              <u>text...</u>" when the optional text is specified,  otherwise  reply  with  a  generic  error  response
              message.

       <b>DEFER</b> <u>optional</u> <u>text...</u>
              Reject  the  address  etc.  that  matches the pattern. Reply with "<b>$access_map_defer_code</b> <u>optional</u>
              <u>text...</u>" when the optional text is specified,  otherwise  reply  with  a  generic  error  response
              message.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

       <b>DEFER_IF_REJECT</b> <u>optional</u> <u>text...</u>
              Defer  the  request  if  some  later  restriction  would  result  in  a  REJECT action. Reply with
              "<b>$access_map_defer_code</b> <b>4.7.1</b> <u>optional</u> <u>text...</u>" when the optional  text  is  specified,  otherwise
              reply with a generic error response message.

              Prior to Postfix 2.6, the SMTP reply code is 450.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>DEFER_IF_PERMIT</b> <u>optional</u> <u>text...</u>
              Defer the request if some later restriction would result in an explicit or implicit PERMIT action.
              Reply  with  "<b>$access_map_defer_code</b> <b>4.7.1</b>  <u>optional</u> <u>text...</u>" when the optional text is specified,
              otherwise reply with a generic error response message.

              Prior to Postfix 2.6, the SMTP reply code is 450.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       For other reject actions, see "OTHER ACTIONS" below.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>restriction...</u>
              Apply the named UCE restriction(s) (<b>permit</b>, <b>reject</b>, <b>reject_unauth_destination</b>, and so on).

       <b>BCC</b> <u>user@domain</u>
              Send one copy of the message to the specified recipient.

              If multiple BCC actions are specified within the same SMTP MAIL transaction, with Postfix 3.0 only
              the last action will be used.

              This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

       <b>DISCARD</b> <u>optional</u> <u>text...</u>
              Claim successful delivery and silently discard the message.  Log the optional text  if  specified,
              otherwise log a generic message.

              Note:  this action currently affects all recipients of the message.  To discard only one recipient
              without discarding the entire message, use the <a href="../man5/transport.5.html">transport</a>(5) table to direct mail to the <a href="../man8/discard.8.html">discard</a>(8)
              service.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       <b>DUNNO</b>  Pretend that the lookup key was not found. This prevents Postfix from  trying  substrings  of  the
              lookup key (such as a subdomain name, or a network address subnetwork).

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       <b>FILTER</b> <u>transport:destination</u>
              After  the  message  is  queued,  send  the  entire message through the specified external content
              filter. The <u>transport</u> name specifies the first field  of  a  mail  delivery  agent  definition  in
              master.cf;  the  syntax  of  the  next-hop  <u>destination</u>  is  described  in  the manual page of the
              corresponding delivery agent.  More information about external content filters is in  the  Postfix
              FILTER_README file.

              Note  1:  do  not use $<u>number</u> regular expression substitutions for <u>transport</u> or <u>destination</u> unless
              you know that the information has a trusted origin.

              Note 2: this action overrides the main.cf <b>content_filter</b> setting, and affects  all  recipients  of
              the message. In the case that multiple <b>FILTER</b> actions fire, only the last one is executed.

              Note  3:  the  purpose  of  the  FILTER  command  is to override message routing.  To override the
              recipient's <u>transport</u> but not the  next-hop  <u>destination</u>,  specify  an  empty  filter  <u>destination</u>
              (Postfix  2.7  and  later),  or  specify a <u>transport:destination</u> that delivers through a different
              Postfix instance (Postfix 2.6 and earlier). Other options are using the recipient-dependent <b>trans‐</b>
              <b>port_maps</b> or the sender-dependent <b>sender_dependent_default_transport_maps</b> features.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       <b>HOLD</b> <u>optional</u> <u>text...</u>
              Place the message on the <b>hold</b> queue, where it will sit until someone either deletes it or releases
              it for delivery.  Log the optional text if specified, otherwise log a generic message.

              Mail that is placed on hold can be examined with the <b><a href="../man1/postcat.1.html">postcat</a></b>(1) command, and can be  destroyed  or
              released with the <b><a href="../man1/postsuper.1.html">postsuper</a></b>(1) command.

              Note:  use  "<b>postsuper</b>  <b>-r</b>"  to  release  mail that was kept on hold for a significant fraction of
              <b>$maximal_queue_lifetime</b> or <b>$bounce_queue_lifetime</b>, or longer. Use "<b>postsuper</b>  <b>-H</b>"  only  for  mail
              that will not expire within a few delivery attempts.

              Note: this action currently affects all recipients of the message.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       <b>PREPEND</b> <u>headername:</u> <u>headervalue</u>
              Prepend  the specified message header to the message.  When more than one PREPEND action executes,
              the first prepended header appears before the second etc. prepended header.

              Note: this action must execute before the message content is received; it cannot  execute  in  the
              context of <b>smtpd_end_of_data_restrictions</b>.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>REDIRECT</b> <u>user@domain</u>
              After  the  message  is  queued, send the message to the specified address instead of the intended
              recipient(s).  When multiple <b>REDIRECT</b> actions fire, only the last one takes effect.

              Note 1: this action overrides the FILTER action, and currently overrides  all  recipients  of  the
              message.

              Note  2: a REDIRECT address is subject to canonicalization (add missing domain) but NOT subject to
              canonical, masquerade, bcc, or virtual alias mapping.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>INFO</b> <u>optional</u> <u>text...</u>
              Log an informational record with the optional  text,  together  with  client  information  and  if
              available, with helo, sender, recipient and protocol information.

              This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

       <b>WARN</b> <u>optional</u> <u>text...</u>
              Log  a  warning  with  the  optional text, together with client information and if available, with
              helo, sender, recipient and protocol information.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>ENHANCED</b> <b>STATUS</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       Postfix version 2.3 and later support enhanced status codes as defined in RFC  3463.   When  an  enhanced
       status code is specified in an access table, it is subject to modification. The following transformations
       are needed when the same access table is used for client, helo, sender, or recipient access restrictions;
       they happen regardless of whether Postfix replies to a MAIL FROM, RCPT TO or other SMTP command.

       •      When  a sender address matches a REJECT action, the Postfix SMTP server will transform a recipient
              DSN status (e.g., 4.1.1-4.1.6) into the corresponding sender DSN status, and vice versa.

       •      When non-address information matches a REJECT action (such as the HELO  command  argument  or  the
              client  hostname/address), the Postfix SMTP server will transform a sender or recipient DSN status
              into a generic non-address DSN status (e.g., 4.0.0).

</pre><h4><b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSION</b> <b>TABLES</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes how the table lookups change when the table  is  given  in  the  form  of  regular
       expressions.  For  a  description  of  regular  expression  lookup  table  syntax, see <b><a href="../man5/regexp_table.5.html">regexp_table</a></b>(5) or
       <b><a href="../man5/pcre_table.5.html">pcre_table</a></b>(5).

       Each pattern is a regular expression that is applied to the entire string being looked up.  Depending  on
       the application, that string is an entire client hostname, an entire client IP address, or an entire mail
       address.  Thus,  no  parent  domain  or parent network search is done, <u>user@domain</u> mail addresses are not
       broken up into their <u>user@</u> and <u>domain</u> constituent parts, nor is <u>user+foo</u> broken up into <u>user</u> and <u>foo</u>.

       Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a pattern is found  that  matches  the
       search string.

       Actions  are  the  same  as  with  indexed  file  lookups, with the additional feature that parenthesized
       substrings from the pattern can be interpolated as <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b> and so on.

</pre><h4><b>TCP-BASED</b> <b>TABLES</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes how the table lookups change when lookups are directed to a TCP-based server.  For
       a  description of the TCP client/server lookup protocol, see <b><a href="../man5/tcp_table.5.html">tcp_table</a></b>(5).  This feature is not available
       up to and including Postfix version 2.4.

       Each lookup operation uses the entire query string once.  Depending on the application, that string is an
       entire client hostname, an entire client IP address, or an entire mail address.  Thus, no  parent  domain
       or  parent  network  search  is  done,  <u>user@domain</u> mail addresses are not broken up into their <u>user@</u> and
       <u>domain</u> constituent parts, nor is <u>user+foo</u> broken up into <u>user</u> and <u>foo</u>.

       Actions are the same as with indexed file lookups.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The following example uses an indexed file, so that the order of  table  entries  does  not  matter.  The
       example  permits  access  by  the  client at address 1.2.3.4 but rejects all other clients in 1.2.3.0/24.
       Instead of <b>hash</b> lookup tables, some systems use <b>dbm</b>.  Use the command "<b>postconf</b>  <b>-m</b>"  to  find  out  what
       lookup tables Postfix supports on your system.

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           smtpd_client_restrictions =
               check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/access

       /etc/postfix/access:
           1.2.3   REJECT
           1.2.3.4 OK

       Execute the command "<b>postmap</b> <b>/etc/postfix/access</b>" after editing the file.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The table format does not understand quoting conventions.
