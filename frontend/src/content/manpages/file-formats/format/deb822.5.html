</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       deb822 - Debian RFC822 control data format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The package management system manipulates data represented in a common format, known as <u>control</u> <u>data</u>,
       stored in <u>control</u> <u>files</u>.  Control files are used for source packages, binary packages and the <b>.changes</b>
       files which control the installation of uploaded files (<b>dpkg</b>'s internal databases are in a similar
       format).

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       A control file consists of one or more stanzas of fields (the stanzas sometimes used to be referred to as
       paragraphs).  The stanzas are separated by empty lines.  Parsers may accept lines consisting solely of
       U+0020 <b>SPACE</b> and U+0009 <b>TAB</b> as stanza separators, but control files should use empty lines.  Some control
       files allow only one stanza; others allow several, in which case each stanza usually refers to a
       different package.  (For example, in source packages, the first stanza refers to the source package, and
       later stanzas refer to binary packages generated from the source.)  The ordering of the stanzas in
       control files is significant.

       Each stanza consists of a series of data fields.  Each field consists of the field name followed by a
       colon (U+003A ‘<b>:</b>’), and then the data/value associated with that field.  The field name is composed of
       US-ASCII characters excluding control characters, space, and colon (i.e., characters in the ranges U+0021
       ‘<b>!</b>’ through U+0039 ‘<b>9</b>’, and U+003B ‘<b>;</b>’ through U+007E ‘<b>~</b>’, inclusive).  Field names must not begin with
       the comment character (U+0023 ‘<b>#</b>’), nor with the hyphen character (U+002D ‘<b>-</b>’).

       The field ends at the end of the line or at the end of the last continuation line (see below).
       Horizontal whitespace (U+0020 <b>SPACE</b> and U+0009 <b>TAB</b>) may occur immediately before or after the value and
       is ignored there; it is conventional to put a single space after the colon.  For example, a field might
       be:

        Package: dpkg

       the field name is <b>Package</b> and the field value <b>dpkg</b>.

       Empty field values are only permitted in source package control files (<u>debian/control</u>).  Such fields are
       ignored.

       A stanza must not contain more than one instance of a particular field name.

       There are three types of fields:

           <b>simple</b>
               The  field,  including  its value, must be a single line.  Folding of the field is not permitted.
               This is the default field type if the definition of the field does not specify a different type.

           <b>folded</b>
               The value of a folded field is a logical line that may span several lines.  The lines  after  the
               first  are  called  continuation  lines  and  must  start  with  a  U+0020 <b>SPACE</b> or a U+0009 <b>TAB</b>.
               Whitespace, including any newlines, is not significant in the field values of folded fields.

               This folding method is similar to RFC5322, allowing control files that contain  only  one  stanza
               and no multiline fields to be read by parsers written for RFC5322.

           <b>multiline</b>
               The  value  of a multiline field may comprise multiple continuation lines.  The first line of the
               value, the part on the same line as the field name, often has special significance or may have to
               be empty.  Other lines are added following the same syntax  as  the  continuation  lines  of  the
               folded fields.  Whitespace, including newlines, is significant in the values of multiline fields.

           Whitespace  must  not  appear  inside  names  (of packages, architectures, files or anything else) or
           version numbers, or between the characters of multi-character version relationships.

           The presence and purpose of a field, and the syntax of its value may differ between types of  control
           files.

           Field names are not case-sensitive, but it is usual to capitalize the field names using mixed case as
           shown below.  Field values are case-sensitive unless the description of the field says otherwise.

           Stanza  separators  (empty  lines)  and lines consisting only of U+0020 <b>SPACE</b> and U+0009 <b>TAB</b>, are not
           allowed within field values or between fields.  Empty lines in field values are  usually  escaped  by
           representing them by a U+0020 <b>SPACE</b> followed by a dot (U+002E ‘<b>.</b>’).

           Lines  starting  with  U+0023  ‘<b>#</b>’, without any preceding whitespace are comments lines that are only
           permitted in source package control files (<u>debian/control</u>) and in <b><a href="../man5/deb-origin.5.html">deb-origin</a></b>(5) files.  These comment
           lines are ignored, even between two continuation lines.  They do not end logical lines.

           All control files must be encoded in UTF-8.
