       isodump - format of IEEE 1394 isochronous packets dump file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  isodump  format  stores  a  series  of  IEEE 1394 isochronous stream packets (possibly from multiple
       channels), including their headers.  Its main use is as the output format of  <b><a href="../man1/dumpiso.1.html">dumpiso</a></b>(1)  and  the  input
       format of <b><a href="../man1/sendiso.1.html">sendiso</a></b>(1).

       The  32  byte  header  starts at offset 0 with the string "1394 isodump v1" followed by a zero byte.  The
       next 8 bytes form a 64 bit big endian integer, which represents a bit mask  of  the  channels  that  were
       dumped.   A set bit at position (1 &lt;&lt; x) signifies that channel x was being listened on.  The following 8
       bytes are set to zero.

       The iso packets follow the header and are appended to the data stream in the order  they  were  received.
       The  packets  consist  of  the  header  quadlet  as  originally  received and the data quadlets following
       directly.  The CRC quadlets after header and data do not appear and everything is in big endian, as  seen
       on the bus.

       There  is  no  further framing of the packets in the format, packet boundaries can be found by looking at
       the data size field in the header quadlet of each packet.  The  data  size  field  appears  in  the  most
       significant  16  bits  of the header quadlet, contain the size in bytes (the actual packet is padded to a
       multiple of four bytes) and do not include the header packet.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This format was introduced with the iso send and dump tools distributed with  libraw1394.   No  one  else
       uses it so far.
