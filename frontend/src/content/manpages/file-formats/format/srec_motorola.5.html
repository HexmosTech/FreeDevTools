</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       srec_motorola - Motorola S‐Record hexadecimal file format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This format is also known as the <u>Exorciser</u>, <u>Exormacs</u> or <u>Exormax</u> format.

       Motorola's  S‐record  format  allows  binary  files  to  be  uploaded and downloaded between two computer
       systems.  This type of format is widely used when transferring  programs  and  data  between  a  computer
       system  (such  as  a  PC,  Macintosh,  or  workstation)  and an emulator or evaluation board for Motorola
       microcontrollers and microprocessors.

   <b>The</b> <b>Lines</b>
       Most S‐Record file contain only S‐Record lines (see the next section), which always start with a  capital
       S  character.   Some systems generate various “extensions[rq] which usually manifest as lines which start
       with something else.  These “extension[rq] lines may or  may  not  break  other  systems  made  by  other
       vendors.  Caveat emptor.

   <b>The</b> <b>Fields</b>
       The  S‐Record  format  consists  of 5 fields. These are the type field, length field, address field, data
       field, and the checksum.  The lines always start with a capital S character.
                               ┌───┬──────┬───────────────┬─────────┬──────┬──────────┐
                               │ S │ Type │ Record Length │ Address │ Data │ Checksum │
                               └───┴──────┴───────────────┴─────────┴──────┴──────────┘

       Type    The type field is a 1 character field that specifies whether the record is an S0, S1, S2, S3, S5,
               S6, S7, S8 or S9 field.

       Record Length
               The record length field is a 2 character (1 byte) field that specifies the  number  of  character
               pairs (bytes) in the record, excluding the type and record length fields.

       Address This  is a 2‐, 3‐ or 4‐byte address that specifies where the data in the S‐Record is to be loaded
               into memory.

       Data    The data field contains the executable code, memory‐loadable data or descriptive  information  to
               be transferred.

       Checksum
               The checksum is an 8‐bit field that represents the least significant byte of the one's complement
               of  the  sum  of the values represented by the pairs of characters making up the record's length,
               address, and data fields.

   <b>Record</b> <b>Types</b>
       S0      This type of record is the header record for each block of S‐Records.  The data field may contain
               any descriptive information identifying the  following  block  of  S‐Records.   (It  is  commonly
               “HDR[rq] on many systems.)  The address field is normally zero.

       S1      A record containing data and the 2‐byte address at which the data is to reside.

       S2      A record containing data and the 3‐byte address at which the data is to reside.

       S3      A record containing data and the 4‐byte address at which the data is to reside.

       S5
               An  optional  record  containing  the number of S1, S2 and S3 records transmitted in a particular
               block.  The count appears in the two‐byte address field.  There is no data field.

               This record is optional, you do not have to use it.  Nobody knows if you can have more  than  one
               in a file; and if you do, nobody knows whether or not the line count resets after each one.

               The  <u>srec_cat</u>  command  will  only  ever  use  one, provided the number of lines fits in 16 bits,
               otherwise it will use S6.

                      S6
                              An optional record containing the number of S1, S2 and S3 records transmitted in a
                              particular block.  The count appears in the three‐byte address field.  There is no
                              data field.

                              This record is optional, you do not have to use it.  Nobody knows if you can  have
                              more than one in a file; and if you do, nobody knows whether or not the line count
                              resets after each one.

                              Nobody knows what happens if you mix S5 and S6 records in a file.

                              The  <u>srec_cat</u> command will only ever use one, provided the number of lines fits in
                              24 bits.

                      S7      A termination record for a block of S3 records.  The address field may contain the
                              4‐byte address of the instruction to which control is passed.  There  is  no  data
                              field.

                      S8      A  termination record for a block of S2 records.  The address field may optionally
                              contain the 3‐byte address of the instruction to which control is  passed.   There
                              is no data field.

                      S9      A  termination record for a block of S1 records.  The address field may optionally
                              contain the 2‐byte address of the instruction to which control is passed.  If  not
                              specified,  the  first  entry point specification encountered in the object module
                              input will be used.  There is no data field.

   <b>Size</b> <b>Multiplier</b>
       In general, binary data will expand in sized by  approximately  2.4  times  when  represented  with  this
       format.
