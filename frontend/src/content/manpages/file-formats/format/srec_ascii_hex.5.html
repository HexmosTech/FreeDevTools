</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       srec_ascii_hex - Ascii‐Hex file format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  format  is  also  known as the <u>Ascii‐Space‐Hex</u> or <u>Ascii‐Hex‐Space</u> format.  If you know who invented
       this format, please let me know.  If you have a better or more complete description,  I'd  like  to  know
       that, too.

       The  file  starts with a start‐of‐text (STX or Control‐B) character (0x02).  Everything before the STX is
       ignored.

       Each data byte is represented as 2 hexadecimal characters, followed by  an  "execution  character".   The
       default  execution  character  is  a space, although many programs which write this format omit the space
       character immediately preceding end‐of‐line.

       The address for data bytes is set  by  using  a  sequence  of  $A<u>nnnn</u>,  characters,  where  <u>nnnn</u>  is  the
       4‐character ascii representation of the address.  The comma is required.  There is no need for an address
       record  unless  there  are gaps.  Implicitly, the file starts a address 0 if no address is set before the
       first data byte.

       The file ends with an end‐of‐text (ETX or Control‐C) character (0x03).  Everything following the  ETX  is
       ignored.

       It is also possible to specify a running 16‐bit checksum using a sequence of $S<u>nnnn</u>, characters, although
       this usually appears <u>after</u> the ETX character and is thus often ignored.

   <b>Variant</b> <b>Forms</b>
       In  addition  to  a  space  character, the execution character can also be percent (%) called "ascii‐hex‐
       percent" format, apostrophe (') or comma (,) called "ascii‐hex‐comma" format.  The file must use the same
       execution character throughout.

       If the execution character is a comma, the address and checksum commands are  terminated  by  a  dot  (.)
       rather than a comma (,).

   <b>Size</b> <b>Multiplier</b>
       In  general,  binary  data  will  expand  in  sized by approximately 3.0 times when represented with this
       format.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Here is an example ascii‐hex file.  It contains the data  “Hello,  World[rq]  to  be  loaded  at  address
       0x1000.
              ^B $A1000,
              48 65 6C 6C 6F 2C 20 57 6F 72 6C 64 0A ^C
