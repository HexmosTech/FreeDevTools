       srec_logisim - format Logisim EPROM load files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  file  format used for image files is intentionally simple; this permits you to write a program, such
       as an assembler, that generates memory images that can then be loaded into memory. As an example of  this
       file  format,  if  we  had  a  256‐byte  memory  whose first five bytes were 2, 3, 0, 20, and -1, and all
       subsequent values were 0, then the image would be the following text file.
              v2.0 raw

              02 03 00 14 ff
       The first line identifies the file format used (currently, there is only  one  file  format  recognized).
       Subsequent  values  list  the  values in hexadecimal, starting from address 0; you can place several such
       values on the same line. Logisim will assume that any values unlisted in the file are zero.

       The image file can use run‐length encoding; for example, rather than list the value 00 sixteen times in a
       row, the file can include 16*00  rather  than  repeat  00  sixteen  times.  Notice  than  the  number  of
       repetitions  is written in base 10. Files produced by Logisim will use run‐length encoding for runs of at
       least four values

   <b>Size</b> <b>Multiplier</b>
       In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately  2.95  times  when  represented  with  this
       format.

   <b>Commentary</b>
       This format is particularly deficient.

       • There is no way for changing address in‐flight.  And therefore the format can't have holes in the data.

       • There are no checksums, or any other error checking.

       • There is no provision for a comment header, as distinct to the “v2.0 raw” magic number.

       • There is no provision for an execution start address.
