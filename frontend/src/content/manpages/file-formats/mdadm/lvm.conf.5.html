</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lvm.conf — Configuration file for LVM2

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/etc/lvm/lvm.conf">/etc/lvm/lvm.conf</a></u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lvm.conf</b>  is loaded during the initialisation phase of <b><a href="../man8/lvm.8.html">lvm</a></b>(8).  This file can in turn lead to other files
       being loaded - settings read in later override earlier settings.  File  timestamps  are  checked  between
       commands and if any have changed, all the files are reloaded.

       For a description of each <b><a href="../man5/lvm.conf.5.html">lvm.conf</a></b>(5) setting, run:

       <b>lvmconfig</b> <b>--typeconfig</b> <b>default</b> <b>--withcomments</b> <b>--withspaces</b>

       The settings defined in lvm.conf can be overridden by any of these extended configuration methods:

       <b>direct</b> <b>config</b> <b>override</b> <b>on</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b>
              The  <b>--config</b>  <b>ConfigurationString</b>  command  line  option  takes the ConfigurationString as direct
              string  representation  of  the  configuration  to  override  the  existing   configuration.   The
              ConfigurationString is of exactly the same format as used in any LVM configuration file.

       <b>profile</b> <b>config</b>
              A  profile  is  a  set of selected customizable configuration settings that are aimed to achieve a
              certain  characteristics  in  various  environments  or  uses.  It's  used  to  override  existing
              configuration.  Normally, the name of the profile should reflect that environment or use.

       There are two groups of profiles recognised: <b>command</b> <b>profiles</b> and <b>metadata</b> <b>profiles</b>.

       The  <b>command</b> <b>profile</b> is used to override selected configuration settings at global LVM command level - it
       is applied at the very beginning of LVM command execution and it is used throughout the whole time of LVM
       command execution. The command profile is applied by using the <b>--commandprofile</b> <b>ProfileName</b> command  line
       option that is recognised by all LVM2 commands.

       The  <b>metadata</b>  <b>profile</b> is used to override selected configuration settings at Volume Group/Logical Volume
       level - it is applied independently for each Volume Group/Logical Volume  that  is  being  processed.  As
       such,  each  Volume Group/Logical Volume can store the profile name used in its metadata so next time the
       Volume Group/Logical Volume is processed, the profile is applied automatically. If Volume Group  and  any
       of  its  Logical  Volumes  have different profiles defined, the profile defined for the Logical Volume is
       preferred. The metadata profile can be attached/detached by using the <b>lvchange</b> and <b>vgchange</b> commands  and
       their  <b>--metadataprofile</b>  <b>ProfileName</b>  and <b>--detachprofile</b> options or the <b>--metadataprofile</b> option during
       creation when using <b>vgcreate</b> or <b>lvcreate</b>  command.   The  <b>vgs</b>  and  <b>lvs</b>  reporting  commands  provide  <b>-o</b>
       <b>vg_profile</b>  and  <b>-o</b> <b>lv_profile</b> output options to show the metadata profile currently attached to a Volume
       Group or a Logical Volume.

       The set of options allowed for command profiles is mutually exclusive when compared to the set of options
       allowed for metadata profiles. The settings that belong to either  of  these  two  sets  can't  be  mixed
       together and LVM tools will reject such profiles.

       LVM itself provides a few predefined configuration profiles.  Users are allowed to add more profiles with
       different  values if needed.  For this purpose, there's the <b>command_profile_template.profile</b> (for command
       profiles) and <b>metadata_profile_template.profile</b> (for metadata profiles) which contain all  settings  that
       are  customizable  by  profiles of certain type. Users are encouraged to copy these template profiles and
       edit them as needed. Alternatively, the <b>lvmconfig</b> <b>--file</b> <b>&lt;ProfileName.profile&gt;</b> <b>--type</b>  <b>profilable-command</b>
       <b>&lt;section&gt;</b>  or  <b>lvmconfig</b> <b>--file</b> <b>&lt;ProfileName.profile&gt;</b> <b>--type</b> <b>profilable-metadata</b> <b>&lt;section&gt;</b> can be used to
       generate a configuration with profilable settings in either of the type for given section and save it  to
       new ProfileName.profile (if the section is not specified, all profilable settings are reported).

       The  profiles are stored in <u><a href="file:/etc/lvm/profile">/etc/lvm/profile</a></u> directory by default.  This location can be changed by using
       the <b>config/profile_dir</b> setting.  Each profile configuration is stored in <b>ProfileName.profile</b> file in  the
       profile directory. When referencing the profile, the <b>.profile</b> suffix is left out.

       <b>tag</b> <b>config</b>
              See <b>tags</b> configuration setting description below.

       When  several  configuration  methods  are  used  at  the same time and when LVM looks for the value of a
       particular setting, it traverses this <b>config</b> <b>cascade</b> from left to right:

       <b>direct</b> <b>config</b> <b>override</b> <b>on</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b> → <b>command</b> <b>profile</b> <b>config</b> → <b>metadata</b> <b>profile</b> <b>config</b> → <b>tag</b> <b>config</b>  →
       <b>lvmlocal.conf</b> → <b>lvm.conf</b>

       No  part  of  this  cascade is compulsory. If there's no setting value found at the end of the cascade, a
       default value is used for that setting.  Use <b>lvmconfig</b> to check what settings are in  use  and  what  the
       default values are.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes the configuration file syntax.

       Whitespace  is  not  significant  unless  it is within quotes.  This provides a wide choice of acceptable
       indentation styles.  Comments begin with # and continue to the end of the  line.   They  are  treated  as
       whitespace.

       Here is an informal grammar:

       <b>file</b> = <b>value</b>*
              A configuration file consists of a set of values.

       <b>value</b> = <b>section</b> | <b>assignment</b>
              A value can either be a new section, or an assignment.

       <b>section</b> = <b>identifier</b> '<b>{</b>' <b>value</b>* '<b>}</b>'
              A  section  groups  associated values together. If the same section is encountered multiple times,
              the contents of all instances are concatenated together in the order of appearance.
              It is denoted by a name and delimited by curly brackets.
              e.g. backup {
                        ...
                   }

       <b>assignment</b> = <b>identifier</b> '<b>=</b>' ( <b>array</b> | <b>type</b> )
              An assignment associates a type with an identifier. If the identifier  contains  forward  slashes,
              those  are  interpreted  as  path  delimiters.  The statement <b>section/key</b> <b>=</b> <b>value</b> is equivalent to
              <b>section</b> <b>{</b> <b>key</b> <b>=</b> <b>value</b> <b>}</b>. If multiple instances of the same key  are  encountered,  only  the  last
              value is used (and a warning is issued).
              e.g. <b>level</b> <b>=</b> <b>7</b>

       <b>array</b> =  '<b>[</b>' ( <b>type</b> '<b>,</b>')* <b>type</b> '<b>]</b>' | '<b>[</b>' '<b>]</b>'
              Inhomogeneous arrays are supported.
              Elements must be separated by commas.
              An empty array is acceptable.
              An array with one element will be correctly interpreted if the array brackets are missing.

       <b>type</b> = <b>integer</b>|<b>float</b>|<b>string</b>
              <b>integer</b> = [<b>0</b>-<b>9</b>]*
              <b>float</b> = [<b>0</b>-<b>9</b>]*'<b>.</b>'[<b>0</b>-<b>9</b>]*
              <b>string</b> = '<b>"</b>' .* '<b>"</b>'

              Strings  with  spaces must be enclosed in double quotes, single words that start with a letter can
              be left unquoted.

</pre><h4><b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>lvmconfig</b> command prints  the  LVM  configuration  settings  in  various  ways.   See  the  man  page
       <b><a href="../man8/lvmconfig.8.html">lvmconfig</a></b>(8).

       Command to print a list of all possible config settings, with their default values:
       <b>lvmconfig</b> <b>--type</b> <b>default</b>

       Command  to  print  a  list  of  all  possible  config  settings,  with  their default values, and a full
       description of each as a comment:
       <b>lvmconfig</b> <b>--type</b> <b>default</b> <b>--withcomments</b>

       Command to print a list of all possible config settings, with  their  current  values  (configured,  non-
       default values are shown):
       <b>lvmconfig</b> <b>--type</b> <b>current</b>

       Command  to  print  all config settings that have been configured with a different value than the default
       (configured, non-default values are shown):
       <b>lvmconfig</b> <b>--type</b> <b>diff</b>

       Command to print a single config setting, with its default value, and a full description, where "Section"
       refers to the config section, e.g. global, and "Setting" refers to the name of the specific setting, e.g.
       umask:
       <b>lvmconfig</b> <b>--type</b> <b>default</b> <b>--withcomments</b> <b>Section/Setting</b>
