</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lxc-usernet - unprivileged user network administration file.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/lxc/lxc-usernet</u>  controls  the  limits  which  the program <b>lxc-user-nic</b> places on network interfaces
       which an unprivileged user may create.

   <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       This file consists of multiple entries, one per line, of the form:

       <b>user</b> <b>type</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>number</b>

       or

       <b>@group</b> <b>type</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>number</b>

       Where

       <b>user</b>   is the username to whom this entry applies.

       <b>@group</b> is the groupname to which this entry applies.

       <b>type</b>   is the type of network interface being allowed. Only veth is currently supported.

       <b>bridge</b> is the bridge to which the network interfaces may be attached, for instance <u>lxcbr0</u>.

       <b>number</b> is the number or quota of network interfaces of the given type which the given user or  group  may
              attach to the given bridge, for instance <u>2</u>.

       Since  a  user  can  be specified both by username as well as one or more usergroups, it is possible that
       several configuration lines enable that user to create network interfaces. In such cases, any  interfaces
       create are counted towards the quotas of the user or group in the order in which they appear in the file.
       If the quota of one line is full, the rest will be parsed until one is found or the end of the file.
