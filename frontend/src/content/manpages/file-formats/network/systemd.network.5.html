</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       systemd.network - Network configuration

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>network</u>.network

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A plain ini-style text file that encodes network configuration for matching network interfaces, used by
       <b><a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.8.html">systemd-networkd</a></b>(8). See <b><a href="../man7/systemd.syntax.7.html">systemd.syntax</a></b>(7) for a general description of the syntax.

       The main network file must have the extension .network; other extensions are ignored. Networks are
       applied to links whenever the links appear.

       Note that not all settings and configurations can be made with .network files, and that it may be
       necessary to use <b><a href="../man5/systemd.link.5.html">systemd.link</a></b>(5)) or <b><a href="../man5/systemd.netdev.5.html">systemd.netdev</a></b>(5)) files in conjuction with .network files when
       working with physical and virtual network devices respectively.

       The .network files are read from the files located in the system network directories
       <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/network">/usr/lib/systemd/network</a> and /usr/local/lib/systemd/network [1], the volatile runtime network directory
       <a href="file:/run/systemd/network">/run/systemd/network</a> and the local administration network directory /etc/systemd/network. All
       configuration files are collectively sorted and processed in alphanumeric order, regardless of the
       directories in which they live. However, files with identical filenames replace each other. It is
       recommended that each filename is prefixed with a number smaller than "70" (e.g.  10-eth0.network).
       Otherwise, the default .network files or those generated by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-network-generator.service.8.html">systemd-network-generator.service</a></b>(8) may take
       precedence over user configured files. Files in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> have the highest priority, files in <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a> take
       precedence over files with the same name under <a href="file:/usr/.">/usr/.</a> This can be used to override a system-supplied
       configuration file with a local file if needed. As a special case, an empty file (file size 0) or symlink
       with the same name pointing to /dev/null disables the configuration file entirely (it is "masked").

       Along with the network file foo.network, a "drop-in" directory foo.network.d/ may exist. All files with
       the suffix ".conf" from this directory will be merged in the alphanumeric order and parsed after the main
       file itself has been parsed. This is useful to alter or add configuration settings, without having to
       modify the main configuration file. Each drop-in file must have appropriate section headers.

       In addition to <a href="file:/etc/systemd/network">/etc/systemd/network</a>, drop-in ".d" directories can be placed in <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/network">/usr/lib/systemd/network</a>
       or <a href="file:/run/systemd/network">/run/systemd/network</a> directories. Drop-in files in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> take precedence over those in <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a> which in
       turn take precedence over those in <a href="file:/usr/lib/.">/usr/lib/.</a> Drop-in files under any of these directories take
       precedence over the main network file wherever located.

</pre><h4><b>[MATCH]</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The network file contains a [Match] section, which determines if a given network file may be applied to a
       given interface; and a [Network] section specifying how the interface should be configured. The first (in
       alphanumeric order) of the network files that matches a given interface is applied, all later files are
       ignored, even if they match as well.

       Note that any network interfaces that have the <u>ID_NET_MANAGED_BY=</u> udev property set will never be matched
       by any .network files – unless the property's value is the string "io.systemd.Network" – even if the
       [Match] section would otherwise match. This may be used to exclude specific network interfaces from
       <b><a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.8.html">systemd-networkd</a></b>(8)'s management, while keeping the [Match] section generic. The <u>ID_NET_MANAGED_BY=</u>
       property thus declares intended <u>ownership</u> of the device, and permits ensuring that concurrent network
       management implementations do not compete for management of specific devices.

       A network file is said to match a network interface if all matches specified by the [Match] section are
       satisfied. When a network file does not contain valid settings in [Match] section, then the file will
       match all interfaces and <b>systemd-networkd</b> warns about that. Hint: to avoid the warning and to make it
       clear that all interfaces shall be matched, add the following:

           Name=*

       The following keys are accepted:

       <u>MACAddress=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of hardware addresses. The acceptable formats are:

           <b>colon-delimited</b> <b>hexadecimal</b>
               Each field must be one byte. E.g.  "12:34:56:78:90:ab" or "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF".

               Added in version 250.

           <b>hyphen-delimited</b> <b>hexadecimal</b>
               Each field must be one byte. E.g.  "12-34-56-78-90-ab" or "AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF".

               Added in version 250.

           <b>dot-delimited</b> <b>hexadecimal</b>
               Each field must be two bytes. E.g.  "1234.5678.90ab" or "AABB.CCDD.EEFF".

               Added in version 250.

           <b>IPv4</b> <b>address</b> <b>format</b>
               E.g.  "127.0.0.1" or "192.168.0.1".

               Added in version 250.

           <b>IPv6</b> <b>address</b> <b>format</b>
               E.g.  "2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334" or "::1".

               Added in version 250.

           The total length of each MAC address must be 4 (for IPv4 tunnel), 6 (for Ethernet), 16 (for IPv6
           tunnel), or 20 (for InfiniBand). This option may appear more than once, in which case the lists are
           merged. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list of hardware addresses defined prior
           to this is reset. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>PermanentMACAddress=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of hardware's permanent addresses. While <u>MACAddress=</u> matches the device's
           current MAC address, this matches the device's permanent MAC address, which may be different from the
           current one. Use full colon-, hyphen- or dot-delimited hexadecimal, or IPv4 or IPv6 address format.
           This option may appear more than once, in which case the lists are merged. If the empty string is
           assigned to this option, the list of hardware addresses defined prior to this is reset. Defaults to
           unset.

           Added in version 245.

       <u>Path=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of shell-style globs matching the persistent path, as exposed by the udev
           property <u>ID_PATH</u>.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>Driver=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of shell-style globs matching the driver currently bound to the device,
           as exposed by the udev property <u>ID_NET_DRIVER</u> of its parent device, or if that is not set, the driver
           as exposed by <b>ethtool</b> <b>-i</b> of the device itself. If the list is prefixed with a "!", the test is
           inverted.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>Type=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of shell-style globs matching the device type, as exposed by <b>networkctl</b>
           <b>list</b>. If the list is prefixed with a "!", the test is inverted. Some valid values are "ether",
           "loopback", "wlan", "wwan". Valid types are named either from the udev "DEVTYPE" attribute, or
           "ARPHRD_" macros in linux/if_arp.h, so this is not comprehensive.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>Kind=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of shell-style globs matching the device kind, as exposed by <b>networkctl</b>
           <b>status</b> <u>INTERFACE</u> or <b>ip</b> <b>-d</b> <b>link</b> <b>show</b> <u>INTERFACE</u>. If the list is prefixed with a "!", the test is
           inverted. Some valid values are "bond", "bridge", "gre", "tun", "veth". Valid kinds are given by
           netlink's "IFLA_INFO_KIND" attribute, so this is not comprehensive.

           Added in version 251.

       <u>Property=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of udev property names with their values after equals sign ("="). If
           multiple properties are specified, the test results are ANDed. If the list is prefixed with a "!",
           the test is inverted. If a value contains white spaces, then please quote whole key and value pair.
           If a value contains quotation, then please escape the quotation with "\".

           Example: if a .link file has the following:

               Property=ID_MODEL_ID=9999 "ID_VENDOR_FROM_DATABASE=vendor name" "KEY=with \"quotation\""

           then, the .link file matches only when an interface has all the above three properties.

           Added in version 243.

       <u>Name=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of shell-style globs matching the device name, as exposed by the udev
           property "INTERFACE", or device's alternative names. If the list is prefixed with a "!", the test is
           inverted.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>WLANInterfaceType=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of wireless network type. Supported values are "ad-hoc", "station", "ap",
           "ap-vlan", "wds", "monitor", "mesh-point", "p2p-client", "p2p-go", "p2p-device", "ocb", and "nan". If
           the list is prefixed with a "!", the test is inverted.

           Added in version 244.

       <u>SSID=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of shell-style globs matching the SSID of the currently connected
           wireless LAN. If the list is prefixed with a "!", the test is inverted.

           Added in version 244.

       <u>BSSID=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of hardware address of the currently connected wireless LAN. Use full
           colon-, hyphen- or dot-delimited hexadecimal. See the example in <u>MACAddress=</u>. This option may appear
           more than once, in which case the lists are merged. If the empty string is assigned to this option,
           the list is reset.

           Added in version 244.

       <u>Host=</u>
           Matches against the hostname or machine ID of the host. See <u>ConditionHost=</u> in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5) for
           details. When prefixed with an exclamation mark ("!"), the result is negated. If an empty string is
           assigned, the previously assigned value is cleared.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>Virtualization=</u>
           Checks whether the system is executed in a virtualized environment and optionally test whether it is
           a specific implementation. See <u>ConditionVirtualization=</u> in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5) for details. When prefixed
           with an exclamation mark ("!"), the result is negated. If an empty string is assigned, the previously
           assigned value is cleared.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>KernelCommandLine=</u>
           Checks whether a specific kernel command line option is set. See <u>ConditionKernelCommandLine=</u> in
           <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5) for details. When prefixed with an exclamation mark ("!"), the result is negated. If
           an empty string is assigned, the previously assigned value is cleared.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>KernelVersion=</u>
           Checks whether the kernel version (as reported by <b>uname</b> <b>-r</b>) matches a certain expression. See
           <u>ConditionKernelVersion=</u> in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5) for details. When prefixed with an exclamation mark ("!"),
           the result is negated. If an empty string is assigned, the previously assigned value is cleared.

           Added in version 237.

       <u>Credential=</u>
           Checks whether the specified credential was passed to the systemd-udevd.service service. See <b>System</b>
           <b>and</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Credentials</b>[2] for details. When prefixed with an exclamation mark ("!"), the result is
           negated. If an empty string is assigned, the previously assigned value is cleared.

           Added in version 252.

       <u>Architecture=</u>
           Checks whether the system is running on a specific architecture. See <u>ConditionArchitecture=</u> in
           <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5) for details. When prefixed with an exclamation mark ("!"), the result is negated. If
           an empty string is assigned, the previously assigned value is cleared.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>Firmware=</u>
           Checks whether the system is running on a machine with the specified firmware. See <u>ConditionFirmware=</u>
           in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5) for details. When prefixed with an exclamation mark ("!"), the result is negated.

           Added in version 249.

</pre><h4><b>[LINK]</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The [Link] section accepts the following keys:

       <u>MACAddress=</u>
           The hardware address to set for the device.

           Added in version 218.

       <u>MTUBytes=</u>
           The maximum transmission unit in bytes to set for the device. The usual suffixes K, M, G, are
           supported and are understood to the base of 1024.

           Note that if IPv6 is enabled on the interface, and the MTU is chosen below 1280 (the minimum MTU for
           IPv6) it will automatically be increased to this value.

           Added in version 218.

       <u>ARP=</u>
           Takes a boolean. If set to true, the IPv4 ARP (low-level Address Resolution Protocol) and IPv6 NDP
           (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) for this interface are enabled. When unset, the kernel's default will
           be used.

           For example, disabling ARP is useful when creating multiple MACVLAN or VLAN virtual interfaces atop a
           single lower-level physical interface, which will then only serve as a link/"bridge" device
           aggregating traffic to the same physical link and not participate in the network otherwise. Defaults
           to unset.

           Added in version 232.

       <u>Multicast=</u>
           Takes a boolean. If set to true, the multicast flag on the device is enabled. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 239.

       <u>AllMulticast=</u>
           Takes a boolean. If set to true, the driver retrieves all multicast packets from the network. This
           happens when multicast routing is enabled. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 239.

       <u>Promiscuous=</u>
           Takes a boolean. If set to true, promiscuous mode of the interface is enabled. Defaults to unset.

           If this is set to false for the underlying link of a "passthru" mode MACVLAN/MACVTAP, the virtual
           interface will be created with the "nopromisc" flag set.

           Added in version 248.

       <u>Unmanaged=</u>
           Takes a boolean. When "yes", no attempts are made to bring up or configure matching links, equivalent
           to when there are no matching network files. Defaults to "no".

           This is useful for preventing later matching network files from interfering with certain interfaces
           that are fully controlled by other applications.

           Added in version 233.

       <u>Group=</u>
           Link groups are similar to port ranges found in managed switches. When network interfaces are added
           to a numbered group, operations on all the interfaces from that group can be performed at once. Takes
           an unsigned integer in the range 0...2147483647. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>RequiredForOnline=</u>
           Takes a boolean, a minimum operational state (e.g., "carrier"), or a range of operational state
           separated with a colon (e.g., "degraded:routable"). Please see <b><a href="../man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl</a></b>(1) for possible operational
           states. When "yes", the network is deemed required when determining whether the system is online
           (including when running <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online</b>). When "no", the network is ignored when
           determining the online state. When a minimum operational state and an optional maximum operational
           state are set, <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online</b> deems that the interface is online when the operational
           state is in the specified range.

           Defaults to "yes" when <u>ActivationPolicy=</u> is not set, or set to "up", "always-up", or "bound".
           Defaults to "no" when <u>ActivationPolicy=</u> is set to "manual" or "down". This is forced to "no" when
           <u>ActivationPolicy=</u> is set to "always-down".

           The network will be brought up normally (as configured by <u>ActivationPolicy=</u>), but in the event that
           there is no address being assigned by DHCP or the cable is not plugged in, the link will simply
           remain offline and be skipped automatically by <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online</b> if
           "RequiredForOnline=no".

           The boolean value "yes" is translated as follows;

           <b>CAN</b> <b>devices</b>
               "carrier",

               Added in version 256.

           <b>Master</b> <b>devices,</b> <b>e.g.</b> <b>bond</b> <b>or</b> <b>bridge</b>
               "degraded-carrier" with <u>RequiredFamilyForOnline=any</u>,

               Added in version 256.

           <b>Bonding</b> <b>port</b> <b>interfaces</b>
               "enslaved",

               Added in version 256.

           <b>Other</b> <b>interfaces</b>
               "degraded".

               Added in version 236.

           This setting can be overridden by the command line option for <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online</b>. See
           <b><a href="../man8/systemd-networkd-wait-online.service.8.html">systemd-networkd-wait-online.service</a></b>(8) for more details.

           Added in version 236.

       <u>RequiredFamilyForOnline=</u>
           Takes an address family. When specified, an IP address in the given family is deemed required when
           determining whether the link is online (including when running <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online</b>). Takes
           one of "ipv4", "ipv6", "both", or "any". Defaults to "no". Note that this option has no effect if
           "RequiredForOnline=no".

           Added in version 249.

       <u>ActivationPolicy=</u>
           Specifies the policy for <b>systemd-networkd</b> managing the link administrative state. Specifically, this
           controls how <b>systemd-networkd</b> changes the network device's "IFF_UP" flag, which is sometimes
           controlled by system administrators by running e.g., <b>ip</b> <b>link</b> <b>set</b> <b>dev</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>up</b> or <b>ip</b> <b>link</b> <b>set</b> <b>dev</b> <b>eth0</b>
           <b>down</b>, and can also be changed with <b>networkctl</b> <b>up</b> <b>eth0</b> or <b>networkctl</b> <b>down</b> <b>eth0</b>.

           Takes one of "up", "always-up", "manual", "always-down", "down", or "bound". When "manual",
           <b>systemd-networkd</b> will not change the link's admin state automatically; the system administrator must
           bring the interface up or down manually, as desired. When "up" (the default) or "always-up", or
           "down" or "always-down", <b>systemd-networkd</b> will set the link up or down, respectively, when the
           interface is (re)configured. When "always-up" or "always-down", <b>systemd-networkd</b> will set the link up
           or down, respectively, any time <b>systemd-networkd</b> detects a change in the administrative state. When
           <u>BindCarrier=</u> is also set, this is automatically set to "bound" and any other value is ignored.

           When the policy is set to "down" or "manual", the default value of <u>RequiredForOnline=</u> is "no". When
           the policy is set to "always-down", the value of <u>RequiredForOnline=</u> forced to "no".

           The administrative state is not the same as the carrier state, so using "always-up" does not mean the
           link will never lose carrier. The link carrier depends on both the administrative state as well as
           the network device's physical connection. However, to avoid reconfiguration failures, when using
           "always-up", <u>IgnoreCarrierLoss=</u> is forced to true.

           Added in version 248.

</pre><h4><b>[SR-IOV]</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       SR-IOV provides the ability to partition a single physical PCI resource into virtual PCI functions which
       can then be e.g. injected into a VM. In the case of network VFs, SR-IOV reduces latency and CPU
       utilisation for north-south network traffic (that is, traffic with endpoints outside the host machine),
       by allowing traffic to bypass the host machine’s network stack.

       The presence of an [SR-IOV] section in a .link file will cause the creation and configuration of the
       specified virtual function. Within a .network file, the specified virtual function will be configured,
       but must already exist. Specify several [SR-IOV] sections to configure several SR-IOVs.

       The [SR-IOV] section accepts the following keys.

       <u>VirtualFunction=</u>
           Specifies a Virtual Function (VF), lightweight PCIe function designed solely to move data in and out.
           Takes an integer in the range 0...2147483646. This option is compulsory.

           Added in version 251.

       <u>VLANId=</u>
           Specifies VLAN ID of the virtual function. Takes an integer in the range 1...4095.

           Added in version 251.

       <u>QualityOfService=</u>
           Specifies quality of service of the virtual function. Takes an integer in the range 1...4294967294.

           Added in version 251.

       <u>VLANProtocol=</u>
           Specifies VLAN protocol of the virtual function. Takes "802.1Q" or "802.1ad".

           Added in version 251.

       <u>MACSpoofCheck=</u>
           Takes a boolean. Controls the MAC spoof checking. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 251.

       <u>QueryReceiveSideScaling=</u>
           Takes a boolean. Toggle the ability of querying the receive side scaling (RSS) configuration of the
           virtual function (VF). The VF RSS information like RSS hash key may be considered sensitive on some
           devices where this information is shared between VF and the physical function (PF). When unset, the
           kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 251.

       <u>Trust=</u>
           Takes a boolean. Allows one to set trust mode of the virtual function (VF). When set, VF users can
           set a specific feature which may impact security and/or performance. When unset, the kernel's default
           will be used.

           Added in version 251.

       <u>LinkState=</u>
           Allows one to set the link state of the virtual function (VF). Takes a boolean or a special value
           "auto". Setting to "auto" means a reflection of the physical function (PF) link state, "yes" lets the
           VF to communicate with other VFs on this host even if the PF link state is down, "no" causes the
           hardware to drop any packets sent by the VF. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 251.

       <u>MACAddress=</u>
           Specifies the MAC address for the virtual function.

           Added in version 251.

</pre><h4><b>[NETWORK]</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The [Network] section accepts the following keys:

       <u>Description=</u>
           A description of the device. This is only used for presentation purposes.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>DHCP=</u>
           Enables DHCPv4 and/or DHCPv6 client support. Accepts "yes", "no", "ipv4", or "ipv6". Defaults to
           "no".

           Note that DHCPv6 will by default be triggered by Router Advertisements, if reception is enabled,
           regardless of this parameter. By explicitly enabling DHCPv6 support here, the DHCPv6 client will be
           started in the mode specified by the <u>WithoutRA=</u> setting in the [DHCPv6] section, regardless of the
           presence of routers on the link, or what flags the routers pass. See <u>IPv6AcceptRA=</u>.

           Furthermore, note that by default the domain name specified through DHCP is not used for name
           resolution. See option <b>UseDomains=</b> below.

           See the [DHCPv4] or [DHCPv6] sections below for further configuration options for the DHCP client
           support.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>DHCPServer=</u>
           Takes a boolean. If set to "yes", DHCPv4 server will be started. Defaults to "no". Further settings
           for the DHCP server may be set in the [DHCPServer] section described below.

           Even if this is enabled, the DHCP server will not be started automatically and wait for the
           persistent storage being ready to load/save leases in the storage, unless <u>RelayTarget=</u> or
           <u>PersistLeases=no</u> are specified in the [DHCPServer] section. It will be started after
           systemd-networkd-persistent-storage.service is started, which calls <b>networkctl</b> <b>persistent-storage</b>
           <b>yes</b>. See <b><a href="../man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl</a></b>(1) for more details.

           Added in version 215.

       <u>LinkLocalAddressing=</u>
           Enables link-local address autoconfiguration. Accepts a boolean, <b>ipv4</b>, and <b>ipv6</b>. An IPv6 link-local
           address is configured when <b>yes</b> or <b>ipv6</b>. An IPv4 link-local address is configured when <b>yes</b> or <b>ipv4</b> and
           when DHCPv4 autoconfiguration has been unsuccessful for some time. (IPv4 link-local address
           autoconfiguration will usually happen in parallel with repeated attempts to acquire a DHCPv4 lease).

           Defaults to <b>no</b> when <u>KeepMaster=</u> or <u>Bridge=</u> is set or when the specified <u>MACVLAN=</u>/<u>MACVTAP=</u> has
           <u>Mode=passthru</u>, or <b>ipv6</b> otherwise.

           Added in version 219.

       <u>IPv6LinkLocalAddressGenerationMode=</u>
           Specifies how IPv6 link-local address is generated. Takes one of "eui64", "none", "stable-privacy"
           and "random". When unset, "stable-privacy" is used if <u>IPv6StableSecretAddress=</u> is specified, and if
           not, "eui64" is used. Note that if <u>LinkLocalAddressing=</u> is "no" or "ipv4", then
           <u>IPv6LinkLocalAddressGenerationMode=</u> will be ignored. Also, even if <u>LinkLocalAddressing=</u> is "yes" or
           "ipv6", setting <u>IPv6LinkLocalAddressGenerationMode=none</u> disables to configure an IPv6 link-local
           address.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>IPv6StableSecretAddress=</u>
           Takes an IPv6 address. The specified address will be used as a stable secret for generating IPv6
           link-local address. If this setting is specified, and <u>IPv6LinkLocalAddressGenerationMode=</u> is unset,
           then <u>IPv6LinkLocalAddressGenerationMode=stable-privacy</u> is implied. If this setting is not specified,
           and "stable-privacy" is set to <u>IPv6LinkLocalAddressGenerationMode=</u>, then a stable secret address will
           be generated from the local machine ID and the interface name.

           Added in version 249.

       <u>IPv4LLStartAddress=</u>
           Specifies the first IPv4 link-local address to try. Takes an IPv4 address for example 169.254.1.2,
           from the link-local address range: 169.254.0.0/16 except for 169.254.0.0/24 and 169.254.255.0/24.
           This setting may be useful if the device should always have the same address as long as there is no
           address conflict. When unset, a random address will be automatically selected. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 252.

       <u>IPv4LLRoute=</u>
           Takes a boolean. If set to true, sets up the route needed for non-IPv4LL hosts to communicate with
           IPv4LL-only hosts. Defaults to false.

           Added in version 216.

       <u>DefaultRouteOnDevice=</u>
           Takes a boolean. If set to true, sets up the IPv4 default route bound to the interface. Defaults to
           false. This is useful when creating routes on point-to-point interfaces. This is equivalent to e.g.
           the following,

               ip route add default dev veth99

           or,

               [Route]
               Gateway=0.0.0.0

           Currently, there are no way to specify e.g., the table for the route configured by this setting. To
           configure the default route with such an additional property, please use the following instead:

               [Route]
               Gateway=0.0.0.0
               Table=1234

           If you'd like to create an IPv6 default route bound to the interface, please use the following:

               [Route]
               Gateway=::
               Table=1234

           Added in version 243.

       <u>LLMNR=</u>
           Takes a boolean or "resolve". When true, enables <b>Link-Local</b> <b>Multicast</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Resolution</b>[3] on the link.
           When set to "resolve", only resolution is enabled, but not host registration and announcement.
           Defaults to true. This setting is read by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service</a></b>(8).

           Added in version 216.

       <u>MulticastDNS=</u>
           Takes a boolean or "resolve". When true, enables <b>Multicast</b> <b>DNS</b>[4] support on the link. When set to
           "resolve", only resolution is enabled, but not host or service registration and announcement.
           Defaults to false. This setting is read by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service</a></b>(8).

           Added in version 229.

       <u>DNSOverTLS=</u>
           Takes a boolean or "opportunistic". When true, enables <b>DNS-over-TLS</b>[5] support on the link. When set
           to "opportunistic", compatibility with non-DNS-over-TLS servers is increased, by automatically
           turning off DNS-over-TLS servers in this case. This option defines a per-interface setting for
           <b><a href="../man5/resolved.conf.5.html">resolved.conf</a></b>(5)'s global <u>DNSOverTLS=</u> option. Defaults to unset, and the global setting will be used.
           This setting is read by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service</a></b>(8).

           Added in version 239.

       <u>DNSSEC=</u>
           Takes a boolean or "allow-downgrade". When true, enables <b>DNSSEC</b>[6] DNS validation support on the
           link. When set to "allow-downgrade", compatibility with non-DNSSEC capable networks is increased, by
           automatically turning off DNSSEC in this case. This option defines a per-interface setting for
           <b><a href="../man5/resolved.conf.5.html">resolved.conf</a></b>(5)'s global <u>DNSSEC=</u> option. Defaults to unset, and the global setting will be used.
           This setting is read by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service</a></b>(8).

           Added in version 229.

       <u>DNSSECNegativeTrustAnchors=</u>
           A space-separated list of DNSSEC negative trust anchor domains. If specified and DNSSEC is enabled,
           look-ups done via the interface's DNS server will be subject to the list of negative trust anchors,
           and not require authentication for the specified domains, or anything below it. Use this to disable
           DNSSEC authentication for specific private domains, that cannot be proven valid using the Internet
           DNS hierarchy. Defaults to the empty list. This setting is read by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service</a></b>(8).

           Added in version 229.

       <u>LLDP=</u>
           Controls support for Ethernet LLDP packet reception. LLDP is a link-layer protocol commonly
           implemented on professional routers and bridges which announces which physical port a system is
           connected to, as well as other related data. Accepts a boolean or the special value "routers-only".
           When true, incoming LLDP packets are accepted and a database of all LLDP neighbors maintained. If
           "routers-only" is set only LLDP data of various types of routers is collected and LLDP data about
           other types of devices ignored (such as stations, telephones and others). If false, LLDP reception is
           disabled. Defaults to "routers-only". Use <b><a href="../man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl</a></b>(1) to query the collected neighbor data. LLDP is
           only available on Ethernet links. See <u>EmitLLDP=</u> below for enabling LLDP packet emission from the
           local system.

           Added in version 219.

       <u>EmitLLDP=</u>
           Controls support for Ethernet LLDP packet emission. Accepts a boolean parameter or the special values
           "nearest-bridge", "non-tpmr-bridge" and "customer-bridge". Defaults to false, which turns off LLDP
           packet emission. If not false, a short LLDP packet with information about the local system is sent
           out in regular intervals on the link. The LLDP packet will contain information about the local
           hostname, the local machine ID (as stored in <b><a href="../man5/machine-id.5.html">machine-id</a></b>(5)) and the local interface name, as well as
           the pretty hostname of the system (as set in <b><a href="../man5/machine-info.5.html">machine-info</a></b>(5)). LLDP emission is only available on
           Ethernet links. Note that this setting passes data suitable for identification of host to the network
           and should thus not be enabled on untrusted networks, where such identification data should not be
           made available. Use this option to permit other systems to identify on which interfaces they are
           connected to this system. The three special values control propagation of the LLDP packets. The
           "nearest-bridge" setting permits propagation only to the nearest connected bridge, "non-tpmr-bridge"
           permits propagation across Two-Port MAC Relays, but not any other bridges, and "customer-bridge"
           permits propagation until a customer bridge is reached. For details about these concepts, see <b>IEEE</b>
           <b>802.1AB-2016</b>[7]. Note that configuring this setting to true is equivalent to "nearest-bridge", the
           recommended and most restricted level of propagation. See <u>LLDP=</u> above for an option to enable LLDP
           reception.

           Added in version 230.

       <u>BindCarrier=</u>
           A link name or a list of link names. When set, controls the behavior of the current link. When all
           links in the list are in an operational down state, the current link is brought down. When at least
           one link has carrier, the current interface is brought up.

           This forces <u>ActivationPolicy=</u> to be set to "bound".

           Added in version 220.

       <u>Address=</u>
           A static IPv4 or IPv6 address and its prefix length, separated by a "/" character. Specify this key
           more than once to configure several addresses. The format of the address must be as described in
           <b><a href="../man3/inet_pton.3.html">inet_pton</a></b>(3). This is a short-hand for an [Address] section only containing an Address key (see
           below). This option may be specified more than once.

           If the specified address is "0.0.0.0" (for IPv4) or "::" (for IPv6), a new address range of the
           requested size is automatically allocated from a system-wide pool of unused ranges. Note that the
           prefix length must be equal or larger than 8 for IPv4, and 64 for IPv6. The allocated range is
           checked against all current network interfaces and all known network configuration files to avoid
           address range conflicts. The default system-wide pool consists of 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12 and
           10.0.0.0/8 for IPv4, and fd00::/8 for IPv6. This functionality is useful to manage a large number of
           dynamically created network interfaces with the same network configuration and automatic address
           range assignment.

           If an IPv4 link-local address (169.254.0.0/16) is specified, IPv4 Address Conflict Detection (<b>RFC</b>
           <b>5227</b>[8]) is enabled for the address. To assign an IPv4 link-local address without IPv4 Address
           Conflict Detection, please use [Address] section to configure the address and disable
           <u>DuplicateAddressDetection=</u>.

               [Address]
               Address=169.254.10.1/24
               DuplicateAddressDetection=none

           If an empty string is specified, then the all previous assignments in both [Network] and [Address]
           sections are cleared.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>Gateway=</u>
           The gateway address, which must be in the format described in <b><a href="../man3/inet_pton.3.html">inet_pton</a></b>(3). This is a short-hand for
           a [Route] section only containing a <u>Gateway=</u> key. This option may be specified more than once.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>DNS=</u>
           A DNS server address, which must be in the format described in <b><a href="../man3/inet_pton.3.html">inet_pton</a></b>(3). This option may be
           specified more than once. Each address can optionally take a port number separated with ":", a
           network interface name or index separated with "%", and a Server Name Indication (SNI) separated with
           "#". When IPv6 address is specified with a port number, then the address must be in the square
           brackets. That is, the acceptable full formats are "111.222.333.444:9953%ifname#example.com" for IPv4
           and "[1111:2222::3333]:9953%ifname#example.com" for IPv6. If an empty string is assigned, then the
           all previous assignments are cleared. This setting is read by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service</a></b>(8).

           Added in version 211.

       <u>UseDomains=</u>
           Specifies the protocol-independent default value for the same settings in [IPv6AcceptRA], [DHCPv4],
           and [DHCPv6] sections below. Takes a boolean, or the special value <b>route</b>. See also the same setting
           in [DHCPv4] below. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 256.

       <u>Domains=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of domains which should be resolved using the DNS servers on this link.
           Each item in the list should be a domain name, optionally prefixed with a tilde ("~"). The domains
           with the prefix are called "routing-only domains". The domains without the prefix are called "search
           domains" and are first used as search suffixes for extending single-label hostnames (hostnames
           containing no dots) to become fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). If a single-label hostname is
           resolved on this interface, each of the specified search domains are appended to it in turn,
           converting it into a fully qualified domain name, until one of them may be successfully resolved.

           Both "search" and "routing-only" domains are used for routing of DNS queries: look-ups for hostnames
           ending in those domains (hence also single label names, if any "search domains" are listed), are
           routed to the DNS servers configured for this interface. The domain routing logic is particularly
           useful on multi-homed hosts with DNS servers serving particular private DNS zones on each interface.

           The "routing-only" domain "~."  (the tilde indicating definition of a routing domain, the dot
           referring to the DNS root domain which is the implied suffix of all valid DNS names) has special
           effect. It causes all DNS traffic which does not match another configured domain routing entry to be
           routed to DNS servers specified for this interface. This setting is useful to prefer a certain set of
           DNS servers if a link on which they are connected is available.

           This setting is read by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service</a></b>(8). "Search domains" correspond to the <u>domain</u> and
           <u>search</u> entries in <b><a href="../man5/resolv.conf.5.html">resolv.conf</a></b>(5). Domain name routing has no equivalent in the traditional glibc API,
           which has no concept of domain name servers limited to a specific link.

           Added in version 216.

       <u>DNSDefaultRoute=</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. If true, this link's configured DNS servers are used for resolving domain
           names that do not match any link's configured <u>Domains=</u> setting. If false, this link's configured DNS
           servers are never used for such domains, and are exclusively used for resolving names that match at
           least one of the domains configured on this link. If not specified, defaults to an automatic mode:
           queries not matching any link's configured domains will be routed to this link if it has no
           routing-only domains configured.

           Added in version 240.

       <u>NTP=</u>
           An NTP server address (either an IP address, or a hostname). This option may be specified more than
           once. This setting is read by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-timesyncd.service.8.html">systemd-timesyncd.service</a></b>(8).

           Added in version 216.

       <u>IPv4Forwarding=</u>
           Configures IPv4 packet forwarding for the interface. Takes a boolean value. This controls the
           net.ipv4.conf.<u>INTERFACE</u>.forwarding sysctl option of the network interface. See <b>IP</b> <b>Sysctl</b>[9] for more
           details about the sysctl option. Defaults to true if <u>IPMasquerade=</u> is enabled for IPv4, otherwise the
           value specified to the same setting in <b><a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf</a></b>(5) will be used. If none of them are specified,
           the sysctl option will not be changed.

           To control the global setting, use the same setting in <b><a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf</a></b>(5).

           Added in version 256.

       <u>IPv6Forwarding=</u>
           Configures interface-specific host/router behaviour. Takes a boolean value. This controls the
           net.ipv6.conf.<u>INTERFACE</u>.forwarding sysctl option of the network interface. See <b>IP</b> <b>Sysctl</b>[9] for more
           details about the sysctl option. Defaults to true if <u>IPMasquerade=</u> is enabled for IPv6 or <u>IPv6SendRA=</u>
           is enabled, otherwise the value specified to the same setting in <b><a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf</a></b>(5) will be used. If
           none of them are specified, the sysctl option will not be changed.

           To control the global setting, use the same setting in <b><a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf</a></b>(5).

           Note, unlike <u>IPv4Forwarding=</u>, enabling per-interface <u>IPv6Forwarding=</u> on two or more interfaces <u>DOES</u>
           <u>NOT</u> make IPv6 packets forwarded within the interfaces. This setting just controls the per-interface
           sysctl value, and the sysctl value is not directly correlated to whether packets are forwarded. To
           ensure IPv6 packets forwarded, the global setting in <b><a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf</a></b>(5) needs to be enabled.

           Added in version 256.

       <u>IPMasquerade=</u>
           Configures IP masquerading for the network interface. If enabled, packets forwarded from the network
           interface will be appear as coming from the local host. Typically, this should be enabled on the
           downstream interface of routers. Takes one of "ipv4", "ipv6", "both", or "no". Defaults to "no". Note
           that any positive boolean values such as "yes" or "true" are now deprecated. Please use one of the
           values above. Specifying "ipv4" or "both" implies <u>IPv4Forwarding=</u> settings in both .network file for
           this interface and the global <b><a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf</a></b>(5) unless they are explicitly specified. Similarly for
           <u>IPv6Forwarding=</u> when "ipv6" or "both" is specified. See <u>IPv4Forwarding=</u>/<u>IPv6Forwarding=</u> in the above
           for the per-link settings, and <b><a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf</a></b>(5) for the global settings.

           Added in version 219.

       <u>IPv6PrivacyExtensions=</u>
           Configures use of stateless temporary addresses that change over time (see <b>RFC</b> <b>4941</b>[10], Privacy
           Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6). Takes a boolean or the special values
           "prefer-public" and "kernel". When true, enables the privacy extensions and prefers temporary
           addresses over public addresses. When "prefer-public", enables the privacy extensions, but prefers
           public addresses over temporary addresses. When false, the privacy extensions remain disabled. When
           "kernel", the kernel's default setting will be left in place. When unspecified, the value specified
           in the same setting in <b><a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf</a></b>(5), which defaults to "no", will be used.

           Added in version 222.

       <u>IPv6AcceptRA=</u>
           Takes a boolean. Controls IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) reception support for the interface. If
           true, RAs are accepted; if false, RAs are ignored. When RAs are accepted, they may trigger the start
           of the DHCPv6 client if the relevant flags are set in the RA data, or if no routers are found on the
           link. Defaults to false for bridge devices, when <u>IPv6Forwarding=</u>, <u>IPv6SendRA=</u>, or <u>KeepMaster=</u> is
           enabled. Otherwise, enabled by default. Cannot be enabled on devices aggregated in a bond device or
           when link-local addressing is disabled.

           Further settings for the IPv6 RA support may be configured in the [IPv6AcceptRA] section, see below.

           Also see <b>IP</b> <b>Sysctl</b>[9] in the kernel documentation regarding "accept_ra", but note that systemd's
           setting of <b>1</b> (i.e. true) corresponds to kernel's setting of <b>2</b>.

           Note that kernel's implementation of the IPv6 RA protocol is always disabled, regardless of this
           setting. If this option is enabled, a userspace implementation of the IPv6 RA protocol is used, and
           the kernel's own implementation remains disabled, since <b>systemd-networkd</b> needs to know all details
           supplied in the advertisements, and these are not available from the kernel if the kernel's own
           implementation is used.

           Added in version 231.

       <u>IPv6DuplicateAddressDetection=</u>
           Configures the amount of IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) probes to send. When unset, the
           kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 228.

       <u>IPv6HopLimit=</u>
           Configures IPv6 Hop Limit. Takes an integer in the range 1...255. For each router that forwards the
           packet, the hop limit is decremented by 1. When the hop limit field reaches zero, the packet is
           discarded. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 228.

       <u>IPv6RetransmissionTimeSec=</u>
           Configures IPv6 Retransmission Time. The time between retransmitted Neighbor Solicitation messages.
           Used by address resolution and the Neighbor Unreachability Detection algorithm. A value of zero is
           ignored and the kernel's current value will be used. Defaults to unset, and the kernel's current
           value will be used.

           Added in version 256.

       <u>IPv4ReversePathFilter=</u>
           Configure IPv4 Reverse Path Filtering. If enabled, when an IPv4 packet is received, the machine will
           first check whether the <u>source</u> of the packet would be routed through the interface it came in. If
           there is no route to the source on that interface, the machine will drop the packet. Takes one of
           "no", "strict", or "loose". When "no", no source validation will be done. When "strict", each
           incoming packet is tested against the FIB and if the incoming interface is not the best reverse path,
           the packet check will fail. By default, failed packets are discarded. When "loose", each incoming
           packet's source address is tested against the FIB. The packet is dropped only if the source address
           is not reachable via any interface on that router. See <b>RFC</b> <b>3704</b>[11]. When unset, the kernel's default
           will be used.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>MulticastIGMPVersion=</u>
           Configures IPv4 Multicast IGMP Version to be used, and controls the value of
           <a href="file:/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/">/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/</a><u>INTERFACE</u>/force_igmp_version. Takes one of "no", "v1", "v2", or "v3". When
           "no", no enforcement of an IGMP version is applied. IGMPv1/v2 fallbacks are allowed, and
           <b>systemd-networkd</b> will return to IGMPv3 mode after all IGMPv1/v2 Querier Present timers have expired.
           When "v1", use of IGMP version 1 is enforced. An IGMPv1 report will be returned even if IGMPv2/v3
           queries are received. When "v2", use of IGMP version 2 is enforced. An IGMPv2 report will be returned
           if an IGMPv2/v3 query is received.  <b>systemd-networkd</b> will fall back to IGMPv1 if an IGMPv1 query is
           received. When "v3", use of IGMP version 3 is enforced, and the response is the same as with "no".
           Defaults to unset — the sysctl is not set.

           Added in version 257.

       <u>IPv4AcceptLocal=</u>
           Takes a boolean. Accept packets with local source addresses. In combination with suitable routing,
           this can be used to direct packets between two local interfaces over the wire and have them accepted
           properly. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>IPv4RouteLocalnet=</u>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the kernel does not consider loopback addresses as martian source or
           destination while routing. This enables the use of 127.0.0.0/8 for local routing purposes. When
           unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 248.

       <u>IPv4ProxyARP=</u>
           Takes a boolean. Configures proxy ARP for IPv4. Proxy ARP is the technique in which one host, usually
           a router, answers ARP requests intended for another machine. By "faking" its identity, the router
           accepts responsibility for routing packets to the "real" destination. See <b>RFC</b> <b>1027</b>[11]. When unset,
           the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 233.

       <u>IPv4ProxyARPPrivateVLAN=</u>
           Takes a boolean. Configures proxy ARP private VLAN for IPv4, also known as VLAN aggregation, private
           VLAN, source-port filtering, port-isolation, or MAC-forced forwarding.

           This variant of the ARP proxy technique will allow the ARP proxy to reply back to the same interface.

           See <b>RFC</b> <b>3069</b>[12]. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 256.

       <u>IPv6ProxyNDP=</u>
           Takes a boolean. Configures proxy NDP for IPv6. Proxy NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) is a
           technique for IPv6 to allow routing of addresses to a different destination when peers expect them to
           be present on a certain physical link. In this case, a router answers Neighbour Advertisement
           messages intended for another machine by offering its own MAC address as destination. Unlike proxy
           ARP for IPv4, it is not enabled globally, but will only send Neighbour Advertisement messages for
           addresses in the IPv6 neighbor proxy table, which can also be shown by <b>ip</b> <b>-6</b> <b>neighbour</b> <b>show</b> <b>proxy</b>.
           <b>systemd-networkd</b> will control the per-interface `proxy_ndp` switch for each configured interface
           depending on this option. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 234.

       <u>IPv6ProxyNDPAddress=</u>
           An IPv6 address, for which Neighbour Advertisement messages will be proxied. This option may be
           specified more than once.  <b>systemd-networkd</b> will add the <u>IPv6ProxyNDPAddress=</u> entries to the kernel's
           IPv6 neighbor proxy table. This setting implies <u>IPv6ProxyNDP=yes</u> but has no effect if <u>IPv6ProxyNDP=</u>
           has been set to false. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 233.

       <u>IPv6SendRA=</u>
           Whether to enable or disable Router Advertisement sending on a link. Takes a boolean value. When
           enabled, prefixes configured in [IPv6Prefix] sections and routes configured in the [IPv6RoutePrefix]
           sections are distributed as defined in the [IPv6SendRA] section. If <u>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</u> is enabled,
           then the delegated prefixes are also distributed. See <u>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</u> setting and the
           [IPv6SendRA], [IPv6Prefix], [IPv6RoutePrefix], and [DHCPPrefixDelegation] sections for more
           configuration options.

           If enabled, <u>IPv6Forwarding=</u> on this interface is also enabled, unless the setting is explicitly
           specified. See <u>IPv6Forwarding=</u> in the above for more details.

           Added in version 247.

       <u>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</u>
           Takes a boolean value. When enabled, requests subnet prefixes on another link via the DHCPv6 protocol
           or via the 6RD option in the DHCPv4 protocol. An address within each delegated prefix will be
           assigned, and the prefixes will be announced through IPv6 Router Advertisement if <u>IPv6SendRA=</u> is
           enabled. This behaviour can be configured in the [DHCPPrefixDelegation] section. Defaults to
           disabled.

           Added in version 250.

       <u>IPv6MTUBytes=</u>
           Configures IPv6 maximum transmission unit (MTU). An integer greater than or equal to 1280 bytes. When
           unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 239.

       <u>KeepMaster=</u>
           Takes a boolean value. When enabled, the current master interface index will not be changed, and
           <u>BatmanAdvanced=</u>, <u>Bond=</u>, <u>Bridge=</u>, and <u>VRF=</u> settings are ignored. This may be useful when a netdev with
           a master interface is created by another program, e.g.  <b><a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn</a></b>(1). Defaults to false.

           Added in version 250.

       <u>BatmanAdvanced=</u>, <u>Bond=</u>, <u>Bridge=</u>, <u>VRF=</u>
           The name of the B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced, bond, bridge, or VRF interface to add the link to. See
           <b><a href="../man5/systemd.netdev.5.html">systemd.netdev</a></b>(5).

           Added in version 211.

       <u>IPoIB=</u>, <u>IPVLAN=</u>, <u>IPVTAP=</u>, <u>MACsec=</u>, <u>MACVLAN=</u>, <u>MACVTAP=</u>, <u>Tunnel=</u>, <u>VLAN=</u>, <u>VXLAN=</u>, <u>Xfrm=</u>
           The name of an IPoIB, IPVLAN, IPVTAP, MACsec, MACVLAN, MACVTAP, tunnel, VLAN, VXLAN, or Xfrm to be
           created on the link. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.netdev.5.html">systemd.netdev</a></b>(5). This option may be specified more than once.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>ActiveSlave=</u>
           Takes a boolean. Specifies the new active slave. The "ActiveSlave=" option is only valid for
           following modes: "active-backup", "balance-alb", and "balance-tlb". Defaults to false.

           Added in version 235.

       <u>PrimarySlave=</u>
           Takes a boolean. Specifies which slave is the primary device. The specified device will always be the
           active slave while it is available. Only when the primary is off-line will alternate devices be used.
           This is useful when one slave is preferred over another, e.g. when one slave has higher throughput
           than another. The "PrimarySlave=" option is only valid for following modes: "active-backup",
           "balance-alb", and "balance-tlb". Defaults to false.

           Added in version 235.

       <u>ConfigureWithoutCarrier=</u>
           Takes a boolean. Allows <b>systemd-networkd</b> to configure a specific link even if it has no carrier.
           Defaults to false. If enabled, and the <u>IgnoreCarrierLoss=</u> setting is not explicitly set, then it is
           enabled as well.

           With this enabled, to make the interface enter the "configured" state, which is required to make
           <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online</b> work properly for the interface, all dynamic address configuration
           mechanisms like <u>DHCP=</u> and <u>IPv6AcceptRA=</u> (which is enabled by default in most cases) need to be
           disabled. Also, <u>DuplicateAddressDetection=</u> (which is enabled by default for IPv4 link-local addresses
           and all IPv6 addresses) needs to be disabled for all static address configurations. Otherwise,
           without carrier, the interface will be stuck in the "configuring" state, and
           <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online</b> for the interface will timeout. Also, it is recommended to set
           <u>RequiredForOnline=no-carrier</u> to make <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online</b> work for the interface.

           Added in version 235.

       <u>IgnoreCarrierLoss=</u>
           Takes a boolean or a timespan. When true, <b>systemd-networkd</b> retains both the static and dynamic
           configuration of the interface even if its carrier is lost. When false, <b>systemd-networkd</b> drops both
           the static and dynamic configuration of the interface. When a timespan is specified, <b>systemd-networkd</b>
           waits for the specified timespan, and ignores the carrier loss if the link regain its carrier within
           the timespan. Setting 0 seconds is equivalent to "no", and "infinite" is equivalent to "yes".

           Setting a finite timespan may be useful when e.g. in the following cases:

           •   A wireless interface connecting to a network which has multiple access points with the same SSID.

           •   Enslaving a wireless interface to a bond interface, which may disconnect from the connected
               access point and causes its carrier to be lost.

           •   The driver of the interface resets when the MTU is changed.

           When <u>Bond=</u> is specified to a wireless interface, defaults to 3 seconds. When the DHCPv4 client is
           enabled and <u>UseMTU=</u> in the [DHCPv4] section enabled, defaults to 5 seconds. Otherwise, defaults to
           the value specified with <u>ConfigureWithoutCarrier=</u>. When <u>ActivationPolicy=</u> is set to "always-up", this
           is forced to "yes", and ignored any user specified values.

           Added in version 242.

       <u>KeepConfiguration=</u>
           Takes a boolean or one of "static", "dynamic-on-stop", and "dynamic". When "static", <b>systemd-networkd</b>
           will not drop statically configured addresses and routes on starting up process. When
           "dynamic-on-stop", the dynamically configurad addresses and routes, such as DHCPv4, DHCPv6, SLAAC,
           and IPv4 link-local address, will not be dropped when <b>systemd-networkd</b> is being stopped. When
           "dynamic", the dynamically configured addresses and routes will never be dropped, and the lifetime of
           DHCPv4 leases will be ignored. This is contrary to the DHCP specification, but may be the best choice
           if, e.g., the root filesystem relies on this connection. The setting "dynamic" implies
           "dynamic-on-stop", and "yes" implies "dynamic" and "static". Defaults to "dynamic-on-stop" when
           <b>systemd-networkd</b> is running in initrd, "yes" when the root filesystem is a network filesystem, and
           "no" otherwise.

           Added in version 257.

</pre><h4><b>[ADDRESS]</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       An [Address] section accepts the following keys. Specify several [Address] sections to configure several
       addresses.

       <u>Address=</u>
           As in the [Network] section. This setting is mandatory. Each [Address] section can contain one
           <u>Address=</u> setting.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>Peer=</u>
           The peer address in a point-to-point connection. Accepts the same format as the <u>Address=</u> setting.

           Added in version 216.

       <u>Broadcast=</u>
           Takes an IPv4 address or boolean value. The address must be in the format described in <b><a href="../man3/inet_pton.3.html">inet_pton</a></b>(3).
           If set to true, then the IPv4 broadcast address will be derived from the <u>Address=</u> setting. If set to
           false, then the broadcast address will not be set. Defaults to true, except for wireguard interfaces,
           where it default to false.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>Label=</u>
           Specifies the label for the IPv4 address. The label must be a 7-bit ASCII string with a length of
           1...15 characters. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>PreferredLifetime=</u>
           Allows the default "preferred lifetime" of the address to be overridden. Only three settings are
           accepted: "forever", "infinity", which is the default and means that the address never expires, and
           "0", which means that the address is considered immediately "expired" and will not be used, unless
           explicitly requested. A setting of <b>PreferredLifetime=0</b> is useful for addresses which are added to be
           used only by a specific application, which is then configured to use them explicitly.

           Added in version 230.

       <u>Scope=</u>
           The scope of the address, which can be "global" (valid everywhere on the network, even through a
           gateway), "link" (only valid on this device, will not traverse a gateway) or "host" (only valid
           within the device itself, e.g. 127.0.0.1) or an integer in the range 0...255. Defaults to "global".
           IPv4 only - IPv6 scope is automatically assigned by the kernel and cannot be set manually.

           Added in version 235.

       <u>RouteMetric=</u>
           The metric of the prefix route, which is pointing to the subnet of the configured IP address, taking
           the configured prefix length into account. Takes an unsigned integer in the range 0...4294967295.
           When unset or set to 0, the kernel's default value is used. This setting will be ignored when
           <u>AddPrefixRoute=</u> is false.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>HomeAddress=</u>
           Takes a boolean. Designates this address the "home address" as defined in <b>RFC</b> <b>6275</b>[13]. Supported
           only on IPv6. Defaults to false.

           Added in version 232.

       <u>DuplicateAddressDetection=</u>
           Takes one of "ipv4", "ipv6", "both", or "none". When "ipv4", performs IPv4 Address Conflict
           Detection. See <b>RFC</b> <b>5227</b>[8]. When "ipv6", performs IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection. See <b>RFC</b> <b>4862</b>[14].
           Defaults to "ipv4" for IPv4 link-local addresses (169.254.0.0/16), "ipv6" for IPv6 addresses, and
           "none" otherwise.

           Added in version 232.

       <u>ManageTemporaryAddress=</u>
           Takes a boolean. If true the kernel manage temporary addresses created from this one as template on
           behalf of Privacy Extensions <b>RFC</b> <b>3041</b>[15]. For this to become active, the use_tempaddr sysctl setting
           has to be set to a value greater than zero. The given address needs to have a prefix length of 64.
           This flag allows using privacy extensions in a manually configured network, just like if stateless
           auto-configuration was active. Defaults to false.

           Added in version 232.

       <u>AddPrefixRoute=</u>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the prefix route for the address is automatically added. Defaults to
           true.

           Added in version 245.

       <u>AutoJoin=</u>
           Takes a boolean. Joining multicast group on ethernet level via <b>ip</b> <b>maddr</b> command would not work if we
           have an Ethernet switch that does IGMP snooping since the switch would not replicate multicast
           packets on ports that did not have IGMP reports for the multicast addresses. Linux vxlan interfaces
           created via <b>ip</b> <b>link</b> <b>add</b> <b>vxlan</b> or <b>systemd-networkd</b>'s netdev kind vxlan have the group option that
           enables them to do the required join. By extending <b>ip</b> <b>address</b> command with option "autojoin" we can
           get similar functionality for openvswitch (OVS) vxlan interfaces as well as other tunneling
           mechanisms that need to receive multicast traffic. Defaults to "no".

           Added in version 232.

       <u>NetLabel=label</u>
           This setting provides a method for integrating static and dynamic network configuration into Linux
           <b>NetLabel</b>[16] subsystem rules, used by <b>Linux</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>(LSMs)</b>[17] for network access control.
           The label, with suitable LSM rules, can be used to control connectivity of (for example) a service
           with peers in the local network. At least with SELinux, only the ingress can be controlled but not
           egress. The benefit of using this setting is that it may be possible to apply interface independent
           part of NetLabel configuration at very early stage of system boot sequence, at the time when the
           network interfaces are not available yet, with <b><a href="../man8/netlabelctl.8.html">netlabelctl</a></b>(8), and the per-interface configuration
           with <b>systemd-networkd</b> once the interfaces appear later. Currently this feature is only implemented
           for SELinux.

           The option expects a single NetLabel label. The label must conform to lexical restrictions of LSM
           labels. When an interface is configured with IP addresses, the addresses and subnetwork masks will be
           appended to the <b>NetLabel</b> <b>Fallback</b> <b>Peer</b> <b>Labeling</b>[18] rules. They will be removed when the interface is
           deconfigured. Failures to manage the labels will be ignored.

               <b>Warning</b>
               Once labeling is enabled for network traffic, a lot of LSM access control points in Linux
               networking stack go from dormant to active. Care should be taken to avoid getting into a
               situation where for example remote connectivity is broken, when the security policy has not been
               updated to consider LSM per-packet access controls and no rules would allow any network traffic.
               Also note that additional configuration with <b><a href="../man8/netlabelctl.8.html">netlabelctl</a></b>(8) is needed.
           Example:

               [Address]
               NetLabel=system_u:object_r:localnet_peer_t:s0

           With the example rules applying for interface "eth0", when the interface is configured with an IPv4
           address of 10.0.0.123/8, <b>systemd-networkd</b> performs the equivalent of <b>netlabelctl</b> operation

               netlabelctl unlbl add interface eth0 address:10.0.0.0/8 label:system_u:object_r:localnet_peer_t:s0

           and the reverse operation when the IPv4 address is deconfigured. The configuration can be used with
           LSM rules; in case of SELinux to allow a SELinux domain to receive data from objects of SELinux
           "peer" class. For example:

               type localnet_peer_t;
               allow my_server_t localnet_peer_t:peer recv;

           The effect of the above configuration and rules (in absence of other rules as may be the case) is to
           only allow "my_server_t" (and nothing else) to receive data from local subnet 10.0.0.0/8 of interface
           "eth0".

           Added in version 252.

       <u>NFTSet=source</u>:<u>family</u>:<u>table</u>:<u>set</u>
           This setting provides a method for integrating network configuration into firewall rules with <b>NFT</b>[19]
           sets. The benefit of using the setting is that static network configuration (or dynamically obtained
           network addresses, see similar directives in other sections) can be used in firewall rules with the
           indirection of NFT set types. For example, access could be granted for hosts in the local subnetwork
           only. Firewall rules using IP address of an interface are also instantly updated when the network
           configuration changes, for example via DHCP.

           This option expects a whitespace separated list of NFT set definitions. Each definition consists of a
           colon-separated tuple of source type (one of "address", "prefix" or "ifindex"), NFT address family
           (one of "arp", "bridge", "inet", "ip", "ip6", or "netdev"), table name and set name. The names of
           tables and sets must conform to lexical restrictions of NFT table names. The type of the element used
           in the NFT filter must match the type implied by the directive ("address", "prefix" or "ifindex") and
           address type (IPv4 or IPv6) as shown in the table below.

           <b>Table</b> <b>1.</b> <b>Defined</b> <u>source</u> <u>type</u> values
           ┌─────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┐
           │ <b>Source</b> <b>type</b> │ <b>Description</b>     │ <b>Corresponding</b> <b>NFT</b> <b>type</b> <b>name</b> │
           ├─────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
           │ "address"   │ host IP address │ "ipv4_addr" or "ipv6_addr"  │
           ├─────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
           │ "prefix"    │ network prefix  │ "ipv4_addr" or "ipv6_addr", │
           │             │                 │ with "flags interval"       │
           ├─────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
           │ "ifindex"   │ interface index │ "iface_index"               │
           └─────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘

           When an interface is configured with IP addresses, the addresses, subnetwork masks or interface index
           will be appended to the NFT sets. The information will be removed when the interface is deconfigured.
           <b>systemd-networkd</b> only inserts elements to (or removes from) the sets, so the related NFT rules,
           tables and sets must be prepared elsewhere in advance. Failures to manage the sets will be ignored.

           Example:

               [Address]
               NFTSet=prefix:netdev:filter:eth_ipv4_prefix

           Corresponding NFT rules:

               table netdev filter {
                       set eth_ipv4_prefix {
                               type ipv4_addr
                               flags interval
                       }
                       chain eth_ingress {
                               type filter hook ingress device "eth0" priority filter; policy drop;
                               ip daddr != @eth_ipv4_prefix drop
                               accept
                       }

           Added in version 248.

       <u>OnLink=</u>
           Takes a boolean. If set to true, the kernel does not have to check if the gateway is reachable
           directly by the current machine (i.e., attached to the local network), so that we can insert the
           nexthop in the kernel table without it being complained about. Defaults to "no".

           Added in version 248.

       <u>Blackhole=</u>
           Takes a boolean. If enabled, packets to the corresponding routes are discarded silently, and <u>Gateway=</u>
           cannot be specified. Defaults to "no".

           Takes a whitespace separated list of nexthop IDs. Each ID must be in the range 1...4294967295.
           Optionally, each nexthop ID can take a weight after a colon ("<u>id</u>[:<u>weight</u>]"). The weight must be in
           the range 1...255. If the weight is not specified, then it is assumed that the weight is 1. This
           setting cannot be specified with <u>Gateway=</u>, <u>Family=</u>, <u>Blackhole=</u>. This setting can be specified
           multiple times. If an empty string is assigned, then the all previous assignments are cleared.
           Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 249.

</pre><h4><b>[ROUTE]</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The [Route] section accepts the following settings. Specify several [Route] sections to configure several
       routes.

       <u>Gateway=</u>
           Takes the gateway address or the special values "_dhcp4" and "_ipv6ra". If "_dhcp4" or "_ipv6ra" is
           set, then the gateway address provided by DHCPv4 or IPv6 RA is used.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>GatewayOnLink=</u>
           Takes a boolean. If set to true, the kernel does not have to check if the gateway is reachable
           directly by the current machine (i.e., attached to the local network), so that we can insert the
           route in the kernel table without it being complained about. Defaults to "no".

           Added in version 234.

       <u>Destination=</u>
           The destination prefix of the route. Possibly followed by a slash and the prefix length. If omitted,
           a full-length host route is assumed.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>Source=</u>
           The source prefix of the route. Possibly followed by a slash and the prefix length. If omitted, a
           full-length host route is assumed.

           Added in version 218.

       <u>Metric=</u>
           The metric of the route. Takes an unsigned integer in the range 0...4294967295. Defaults to unset,
           and the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 216.

       <u>IPv6Preference=</u>
           Specifies the route preference as defined in <b>RFC</b> <b>4191</b>[24] for Router Discovery messages. Which can be
           one of "low" the route has a lowest priority, "medium" the route has a default priority or "high" the
           route has a highest priority.

           Added in version 234.

       <u>Scope=</u>
           The scope of the IPv4 route, which can be "global", "site", "link", "host", or "nowhere":

           •   "global" means the route can reach hosts more than one hop away.

           •   "site" means an interior route in the local autonomous system.

           •   "link" means the route can only reach hosts on the local network (one hop away).

           •   "host" means the route will not leave the local machine (used for internal addresses like
               127.0.0.1).

           •   "nowhere" means the destination does not exist.

           For IPv4 route, defaults to "host" if <u>Type=</u> is "local" or "nat", and "link" if <u>Type=</u> is "broadcast",
           "multicast", "anycast", or "unicast". In other cases, defaults to "global". The value is not used for
           IPv6.

           Added in version 219.

       <u>PreferredSource=</u>
           The preferred source address of the route. The address must be in the format described in
           <b><a href="../man3/inet_pton.3.html">inet_pton</a></b>(3).

           Added in version 227.

       <u>Table=</u>
           The table identifier for the route. Takes one of predefined names "default", "main", and "local", and
           names defined in <u>RouteTable=</u> in <b><a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf</a></b>(5), or a number between 1 and 4294967295. The table can
           be retrieved using <b>ip</b> <b>route</b> <b>show</b> <b>table</b> <u>num</u>. If unset and <u>Type=</u> is "local", "broadcast", "anycast", or
           "nat", then "local" is used. In other cases, defaults to "main".

           Added in version 230.

           Configures per route hop limit. Takes an integer in the range 1...255. See also <u>IPv6HopLimit=</u>.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>Protocol=</u>
           The protocol identifier for the route. Takes a number between 0 and 255 or the special values
           "kernel", "boot", "static", "ra" and "dhcp". Defaults to "static".

           Added in version 234.

       <u>Type=</u>
           Specifies the type for the route. Takes one of "unicast", "local", "broadcast", "anycast",
           "multicast", "blackhole", "unreachable", "prohibit", "throw", "nat", and "xresolve". If "unicast", a
           regular route is defined, i.e. a route indicating the path to take to a destination network address.
           If "blackhole", packets to the defined route are discarded silently. If "unreachable", packets to the
           defined route are discarded and the ICMP message "Host Unreachable" is generated. If "prohibit",
           packets to the defined route are discarded and the ICMP message "Communication Administratively
           Prohibited" is generated. If "throw", route lookup in the current routing table will fail and the
           route selection process will return to Routing Policy Database (RPDB). Defaults to "unicast".

           Added in version 235.

       <u>InitialCongestionWindow=</u>
           The TCP initial congestion window is used during the start of a TCP connection. During the start of a
           TCP session, when a client requests a resource, the server's initial congestion window determines how
           many packets will be sent during the initial burst of data without waiting for acknowledgement. Takes
           a number between 1 and 1023. Note that 100 is considered an extremely large value for this option.
           When unset, the kernel's default (typically 10) will be used.

           Added in version 237.

       <u>InitialAdvertisedReceiveWindow=</u>
           The TCP initial advertised receive window is the amount of receive data (in bytes) that can initially
           be buffered at one time on a connection. The sending host can send only that amount of data before
           waiting for an acknowledgment and window update from the receiving host. Takes a number between 1 and
           1023. Note that 100 is considered an extremely large value for this option. When unset, the kernel's
           default will be used.

           Added in version 237.

       <u>QuickAck=</u>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the TCP quick ACK mode for the route is enabled. When unset, the kernel's
           default will be used.

           Added in version 237.

       <u>FastOpenNoCookie=</u>
           Takes a boolean. When true enables TCP fastopen without a cookie on a per-route basis. When unset,
           the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 243.

       <u>MTUBytes=</u>
           The maximum transmission unit in bytes to set for the route. The usual suffixes K, M, G, are
           supported and are understood to the base of 1024.

           Added in version 239.

       <u>TCPAdvertisedMaximumSegmentSize=</u>
           Specifies the Path MSS (in bytes) hints given on TCP layer. The usual suffixes K, M, G, are supported
           and are understood to the base of 1024. An unsigned integer in the range 1...4294967294. When unset,
           the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 248.

       <u>TCPCongestionControlAlgorithm=</u>
           Specifies the TCP congestion control algorithm for the route. Takes a name of the algorithm, e.g.
           "bbr", "dctcp", or "vegas". When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 252.

       <u>TCPRetransmissionTimeoutSec=</u>
           Specifies the TCP Retransmission Timeout (RTO) for the route. Takes time values in seconds. This
           value specifies the timeout of an alive TCP connection, when retransmissions remain unacknowledged.
           When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>MultiPathRoute=address[@name]</u> <u>[weight]</u>
           Configures multipath route. Multipath routing is the technique of using multiple alternative paths
           through a network. Takes gateway address. Optionally, takes a network interface name or index
           separated with "@", and a weight in 1..256 for this multipath route separated with whitespace. This
           setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is assigned, then the all previous
           assignments are cleared.

           Added in version 245.

       <u>NextHop=</u>
           Specifies the nexthop id. Takes an unsigned integer in the range 1...4294967295. If set, the
           corresponding [NextHop] section must be configured. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 248.

</pre><h4><b>[DHCPV4]</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The [DHCPv4] section configures the DHCPv4 client, if it is enabled with the <u>DHCP=</u> setting described
       above:

       <u>RequestAddress=</u>
           Takes an IPv4 address. When specified, the Requested IP Address option (option code 50) is added with
           it to the initial DHCPDISCOVER message sent by the DHCP client. Defaults to unset, and an already
           assigned dynamic address to the interface is automatically picked.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>SendHostname=</u>
           When true (the default), the machine's hostname (or the value specified with <u>Hostname=</u>, described
           below) will be sent to the DHCP server. Note that the hostname must consist only of 7-bit ASCII
           lower-case characters and no spaces or dots, and be formatted as a valid DNS domain name. Otherwise,
           the hostname is not sent even if this option is true.

           Added in version 215.

       <u>Hostname=</u>
           Use this value for the hostname which is sent to the DHCP server, instead of machine's hostname. Note
           that the specified hostname must consist only of 7-bit ASCII lower-case characters and no spaces or
           dots, and be formatted as a valid DNS domain name.

           Added in version 223.

       <u>MUDURL=</u>
           When configured, the specified Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) URL will be sent to the DHCPv4
           server. Takes a URL of length up to 255 characters. A superficial verification that the string is a
           valid URL will be performed. DHCPv4 clients are intended to have at most one MUD URL associated with
           them. See <b>RFC</b> <b>8520</b>[25].

           MUD is an embedded software standard defined by the IETF that allows IoT device makers to advertise
           device specifications, including the intended communication patterns for their device when it
           connects to the network. The network can then use this to author a context-specific access policy, so
           the device functions only within those parameters.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>ClientIdentifier=</u>
           The DHCPv4 client identifier to use. Takes one of <b>mac</b> or <b>duid</b>. If set to <b>mac</b>, the MAC address of the
           link is used. If set to <b>duid</b>, an RFC4361-compliant Client ID, which is the combination of IAID and
           DUID, is used. IAID can be configured by <u>IAID=</u>. DUID can be configured by <u>DUIDType=</u> and <u>DUIDRawData=</u>.
           Defaults to <b>duid</b>.

           Added in version 220.

       <u>VendorClassIdentifier=</u>
           The vendor class identifier used to identify vendor type and configuration.

           Added in version 216.

       <u>UserClass=</u>
           A DHCPv4 client can use UserClass option to identify the type or category of user or applications it
           represents. The information contained in this option is a string that represents the user class of
           which the client is a member. Each class sets an identifying string of information to be used by the
           DHCP service to classify clients. Takes a whitespace-separated list of strings.

           Added in version 239.

       <u>DUIDType=</u>
           Override the global <u>DUIDType=</u> setting for this network. See <b><a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf</a></b>(5) for a description of
           possible values.

           Added in version 230.

       <u>DUIDRawData=</u>
           Override the global <u>DUIDRawData=</u> setting for this network. See <b><a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf</a></b>(5) for a description of
           possible values.

           Added in version 230.

       <u>IAID=</u>
           The DHCP Identity Association Identifier (IAID) for the interface, a 32-bit unsigned integer.

           Added in version 230.

       <u>RapidCommit=</u>
           Takes a boolean. The DHCPv4 client can obtain configuration parameters from a DHCPv4 server through a
           rapid two-message exchange (discover and ack). When the rapid commit option is set by both the DHCPv4
           client and the DHCPv4 server, the two-message exchange is used. Otherwise, the four-message exchange
           (discover, offer, request, and ack) is used. The two-message exchange provides faster client
           configuration. See <b>RFC</b> <b>4039</b>[26] for details. Defaults to true when <u>Anonymize=no</u> and neither
           <u>AllowList=</u> nor <u>DenyList=</u> is specified, and false otherwise.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>Anonymize=</u>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the options sent to the DHCP server will follow the <b>RFC</b> <b>7844</b>[27]
           (Anonymity Profiles for DHCP Clients) to minimize disclosure of identifying information. Defaults to
           false.

           This option should only be set to true when <u>MACAddressPolicy=</u> is set to <b>random</b> (see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.link.5.html">systemd.link</a></b>(5)).

           When true, <u>ClientIdentifier=mac</u>, <u>RapidCommit=no</u>, <u>SendHostname=no</u>, <u>Use6RD=no</u>, <u>UseCaptivePortal=no</u>,
           <u>UseMTU=no</u>, <u>UseNTP=no</u>, <u>UseSIP=no</u>, and <u>UseTimezone=no</u> are implied and these settings in the .network
           file are silently ignored. Also, <u>Hostname=</u>, <u>MUDURL=</u>, <u>RequestAddress=</u>, <u>RequestOptions=</u>, <u>SendOption=</u>,
           <u>SendVendorOption=</u>, <u>UserClass=</u>, and <u>VendorClassIdentifier=</u> are silently ignored.

           With this option enabled DHCP requests will mimic those generated by Microsoft Windows, in order to
           reduce the ability to fingerprint and recognize installations. This means DHCP request sizes will
           grow and lease data will be more comprehensive than normally, though most of the requested data is
           not actually used.

           Added in version 235.

       <u>RequestOptions=</u>
           Sets request options to be sent to the server in the DHCPv4 request options list. A
           whitespace-separated list of integers in the range 1...254. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 244.

       <u>SendOption=</u>
           Send an arbitrary raw option in the DHCPv4 request. Takes a DHCP option number, data type and data
           separated with a colon ("<u>option</u>:<u>type</u>:<u>value</u>"). The option number must be an integer in the range
           1...254. The type takes one of "uint8", "uint16", "uint32", "ipv4address", or "string". Special
           characters in the data string may be escaped using <b>C-style</b> <b>escapes</b>[28]. This setting can be specified
           multiple times. If an empty string is specified, then all options specified earlier are cleared.
           Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 244.

       <u>SendVendorOption=</u>
           Send an arbitrary vendor option in the DHCPv4 request. Takes a DHCP option number, data type and data
           separated with a colon ("<u>option</u>:<u>type</u>:<u>value</u>"). The option number must be an integer in the range
           1...254. The type takes one of "uint8", "uint16", "uint32", "ipv4address", or "string". Special
           characters in the data string may be escaped using <b>C-style</b> <b>escapes</b>[28]. This setting can be specified
           multiple times. If an empty string is specified, then all options specified earlier are cleared.
           Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>IPServiceType=</u>
           Takes one of the special values "none", "CS6", or "CS4". When "none" no IP service type is set to the
           packet sent from the DHCPv4 client. When "CS6" (network control) or "CS4" (realtime), the
           corresponding service type will be set. Defaults to "CS6".

           Added in version 244.

       <u>SocketPriority=</u>
           The Linux socket option <b>SO_PRIORITY</b> applied to the raw IP socket used for initial DHCPv4 messages.
           Unset by default. Usual values range from 0 to 6. More details about <b>SO_PRIORITY</b> socket option in
           <b><a href="../man7/socket.7.html">socket</a></b>(7). Can be used in conjunction with [VLAN] section <u>EgressQOSMaps=</u> setting of .netdev file to
           set the 802.1Q VLAN ethernet tagged header priority, see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.netdev.5.html">systemd.netdev</a></b>(5).

           Added in version 253.

       <u>Label=</u>
           Specifies the label for the IPv4 address received from the DHCP server. The label must be a 7-bit
           ASCII string with a length of 1...15 characters. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 250.

       <u>UseDNS=</u>
           When true (the default), the DNS servers received from the DHCP server will be used.

           This corresponds to the <b>nameserver</b> option in <b><a href="../man5/resolv.conf.5.html">resolv.conf</a></b>(5).

           Added in version 211.

       <u>RoutesToDNS=</u>
           When true, the routes to the DNS servers received from the DHCP server will be configured. When
           <u>UseDNS=</u> is disabled, this setting is ignored. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 243.

       <u>UseNTP=</u>
           When true (the default), the NTP servers received from the DHCP server will be used by
           systemd-timesyncd.service.

           Added in version 220.

       <u>RoutesToNTP=</u>
           When true, the routes to the NTP servers received from the DHCP server will be configured. When
           <u>UseNTP=</u> is disabled, this setting is ignored. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 249.

       <u>UseSIP=</u>
           When true (the default), the SIP servers received from the DHCP server will be collected and made
           available to client programs.

           Added in version 244.

       <u>UseCaptivePortal=</u>
           When true (the default), the captive portal advertised by the DHCP server will be recorded and made
           available to client programs and displayed in the <b><a href="../man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl</a></b>(1) status output per-link.

           Added in version 254.

       <u>UseDNR=</u>
           When true, designated resolvers advertised by the DHCP server will be used as encrypted DNS servers.
           See <b>RFC</b> <b>9463</b>[29].

           Defaults to unset, and the value for <u>UseDNS=</u> will be used.

           Added in version 257.

       <u>UseMTU=</u>
           When true, the interface maximum transmission unit from the DHCP server will be used on the current
           link. If <u>MTUBytes=</u> is set, then this setting is ignored. Defaults to false.

           Note, some drivers will reset the interfaces if the MTU is changed. For such interfaces, please try
           to use <u>IgnoreCarrierLoss=</u> with a short timespan, e.g.  "3 seconds".

           Added in version 211.

       <u>UseHostname=</u>
           When true (the default), the hostname received from the DHCP server will be set as the transient
           hostname of the system.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>UseDomains=</u>
           Takes a boolean, or the special value <b>route</b>. When true, the domain name received from the DHCP server
           will be used as DNS search domain over this link, similarly to the effect of the <b>Domains=</b> setting. If
           set to <b>route</b>, the domain name received from the DHCP server will be used for routing DNS queries
           only, but not for searching, similarly to the effect of the <b>Domains=</b> setting when the argument is
           prefixed with "~".

           When unspecified, the value specified in the same setting in the [Network] section will be used. When
           it is unspecified, the value specified in the same setting in the [DHCPv4] section in
           <b><a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf</a></b>(5) will be used. When it is unspecified, the value specified in the same setting in the
           [Network] section in <b><a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf</a></b>(5) will be used. When none of them are specified, defaults to
           "no".

           It is recommended to enable this option only on trusted networks, as setting this affects resolution
           of all hostnames, in particular of single-label names. It is generally safer to use the supplied
           domain only as routing domain, rather than as search domain, in order to not have it affect local
           resolution of single-label names.

           When set to true, this setting corresponds to the <b>domain</b> option in <b><a href="../man5/resolv.conf.5.html">resolv.conf</a></b>(5).

           Added in version 216.

       <u>UseRoutes=</u>
           When true (the default), the static routes will be requested from the DHCP server and added to the
           routing table with a metric of 1024, and a scope of <b>global</b>, <b>link</b> or <b>host</b>, depending on the route's
           destination and gateway. If the destination is on the local host, e.g., 127.x.x.x, or the same as the
           link's own address, the scope will be set to <b>host</b>. Otherwise, if the gateway is null (a direct
           route), a <b>link</b> scope will be used. For anything else, scope defaults to <b>global</b>.

           Added in version 215.

       <u>RouteMetric=</u>
           Set the routing metric for routes specified by the DHCP server (including the prefix route added for
           the specified prefix). Takes an unsigned integer in the range 0...4294967295. Defaults to 1024.

           Added in version 217.

       <u>RouteTable=num</u>
           The table identifier for DHCP routes. Takes one of predefined names "default", "main", and "local",
           and names defined in <u>RouteTable=</u> in <b><a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf</a></b>(5), or a number between 1...4294967295.

           When used in combination with <u>VRF=</u>, the VRF's routing table is used when this parameter is not
           specified.

           Added in version 232.

       <u>RouteMTUBytes=</u>
           Specifies the MTU for the DHCP routes. Please see the [Route] section for further details.

           Added in version 245.

       <u>QuickAck=</u>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the TCP quick ACK mode is enabled for the routes configured by the
           acquired DHCPv4 lease. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 253.

       <u>InitialCongestionWindow=</u>
           As in the [Route] section.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>InitialAdvertisedReceiveWindow=</u>
           As in the [Route] section.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>UseGateway=</u>
           When true, and the DHCP server provides a Router option, the default gateway based on the router
           address will be configured. Defaults to unset, and the value specified with <u>UseRoutes=</u> will be used.

           Note, when the server provides both the Router and Classless Static Routes option, and <u>UseRoutes=</u> is
           enabled, the Router option is always ignored regardless of this setting. See <b>RFC</b> <b>3442</b>[30].

           Added in version 246.

       <u>UseTimezone=</u>
           When true, the timezone received from the DHCP server will be set as timezone of the local system.
           Defaults to false.

           Added in version 226.

       <u>Use6RD=</u>
           When true, subnets of the received IPv6 prefix are assigned to downstream interfaces which enables
           <u>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</u>. See also <u>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</u> in the [Network] section, the
           [DHCPPrefixDelegation] section, and <b>RFC</b> <b>5969</b>[31]. Defaults to false.

           Added in version 250.

       <u>UnassignedSubnetPolicy=</u>
           Takes "none", or one of the reject types: "unreachable", "prohibit", "blackhole", or "throw". If a
           reject type is specified, the reject route corresponding to the acquired 6RD prefix will be
           configured. For example, when "unreachable",

               unreachable 2001:db8::/56 dev lo proto dhcp metric 1024 pref medium

           will be configured. See <b>RFC</b> <b>7084</b>[32]. If "none" is specified, such route will not be configured. This
           may be useful when custom firewall rules that handle packets for unassigned subnets will be
           configured. Defaults to "unreachable".

           Added in version 257.

       <u>IPv6OnlyMode=</u>
           When true, the DHCPv4 configuration will be delayed by the timespan provided by the DHCP server and
           skip to configure dynamic IPv4 network connectivity if IPv6 connectivity is provided within the
           timespan. See <b>RFC</b> <b>8925</b>[33]. Defaults to false.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>FallbackLeaseLifetimeSec=</u>
           Allows one to set DHCPv4 lease lifetime when DHCPv4 server does not send the lease lifetime. Takes
           one of "forever" or "infinity". If specified, the acquired address never expires. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>RequestBroadcast=</u>
           Request the server to use broadcast messages before the IP address has been configured. This is
           necessary for devices that cannot receive RAW packets, or that cannot receive packets at all before
           an IP address has been configured. On the other hand, this must not be enabled on networks where
           broadcasts are filtered out.

           Added in version 216.

       <u>MaxAttempts=</u>
           Specifies how many times the DHCPv4 client configuration should be attempted. Takes a number or
           "infinity". Defaults to "infinity". Note that the time between retries is increased exponentially, up
           to approximately one per minute, so the network will not be overloaded even if this number is high.
           The default is suitable in most circumstances.

           Added in version 243.

       <u>ListenPort=</u>
           Set the port from which the DHCP client packets originate.

           Added in version 233.

       <u>ServerPort=</u>
           Set the port on which the DHCP server is listening.

           Added in version 256.

       <u>DenyList=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of IPv4 addresses. Each address can optionally take a prefix length after
           "/". DHCP offers from servers in the list are rejected. Note that if <u>AllowList=</u> is configured then
           <u>DenyList=</u> is ignored.

           Note that this filters only DHCP offers, so the filtering might not work when <u>RapidCommit=</u> is
           enabled. See also <u>RapidCommit=</u> above.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>AllowList=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of IPv4 addresses. Each address can optionally take a prefix length after
           "/". DHCP offers from servers in the list are accepted.

           Note that this filters only DHCP offers, so the filtering might not work when <u>RapidCommit=</u> is
           enabled. See also <u>RapidCommit=</u> above.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>SendRelease=</u>
           When true, the DHCPv4 client sends a DHCP release packet when it stops. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 243.

       <u>SendDecline=</u>
           A boolean. When true, <b>systemd-networkd</b> performs IPv4 Duplicate Address Detection to the acquired
           address by the DHCPv4 client. If duplicate is detected, the DHCPv4 client rejects the address by
           sending a <b>DHCPDECLINE</b> packet to the DHCP server, and tries to obtain an IP address again. See <b>RFC</b>
           <b>5227</b>[8]. Defaults to false.

           Added in version 245.

       <u>NetLabel=</u>
           This applies the NetLabel for the addresses received with DHCP, like <u>NetLabel=</u> in [Address] section
           applies it to statically configured addresses. See <u>NetLabel=</u> in [Address] section for more details.

           Added in version 252.

       <u>NFTSet=</u>
           This applies the NFT set for the network configuration received with DHCP, like <u>NFTSet=</u> in [Address]
           section applies it to static configuration. See <u>NFTSet=</u> in [Address] section for more details. For
           "address" or "prefix" source types, the type of the element used in the NFT filter must be
           "ipv4_addr".

           Added in version 255.

</pre><h4><b>[DHCPV6]</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The [DHCPv6] section configures the DHCPv6 client, if it is enabled with the <u>DHCP=</u> setting described
       above, or invoked by the IPv6 Router Advertisement:

       <u>MUDURL=</u>, <u>IAID=</u>, <u>DUIDType=</u>, <u>DUIDRawData=</u>, <u>RequestOptions=</u>
           As in the [DHCPv4] section.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>SendOption=</u>
           As in the [DHCPv4] section, however because DHCPv6 uses 16-bit fields to store option numbers, the
           option number is an integer in the range 1...65536.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>SendVendorOption=</u>
           Send an arbitrary vendor option in the DHCPv6 request. Takes an enterprise identifier, DHCP option
           number, data type, and data separated with a colon ("<u>enterprise</u> <u>identifier</u>:<u>option</u>:<u>type</u>:<u>value</u>").
           Enterprise identifier is an unsigned integer in the range 1...4294967294. The option number must be
           an integer in the range 1...254. Data type takes one of "uint8", "uint16", "uint32", "ipv4address",
           "ipv6address", or "string". Special characters in the data string may be escaped using <b>C-style</b>
           <b>escapes</b>[28]. This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is specified, then all
           options specified earlier are cleared. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>UserClass=</u>
           A DHCPv6 client can use User Class option to identify the type or category of user or applications it
           represents. The information contained in this option is a string that represents the user class of
           which the client is a member. Each class sets an identifying string of information to be used by the
           DHCP service to classify clients. Special characters in the data string may be escaped using <b>C-style</b>
           <b>escapes</b>[28]. This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is specified, then all
           options specified earlier are cleared. Takes a whitespace-separated list of strings. Note that
           currently <b>NUL</b> bytes are not allowed.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>VendorClass=</u>
           A DHCPv6 client can use VendorClass option to identify the vendor that manufactured the hardware on
           which the client is running. The information contained in the data area of this option is contained
           in one or more opaque fields that identify details of the hardware configuration. Takes a
           whitespace-separated list of strings.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>PrefixDelegationHint=</u>
           Takes an IPv6 address with prefix length in the same format as the <u>Address=</u> in the [Network] section.
           The DHCPv6 client will include a prefix hint in the DHCPv6 solicitation sent to the server. The
           prefix length must be in the range 1...128. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 244.

       <u>UnassignedSubnetPolicy=</u>
           Takes "none" or one of the reject types: "unreachable", "prohibit", "blackhole", or "throw". If a
           reject type is specified, the reject route corresponding to the delegated prefix will be configured.
           For example, when "unreachable",

               unreachable 2001:db8::/56 dev lo proto dhcp metric 1024 pref medium

           will be configured. See <b>RFC</b> <b>7084</b>[32]. If "none" is specified, such route will not be configured. This
           may be useful when custom firewall rules that handle packets for unassigned subnets will be
           configured. Defaults to "unreachable".

           Added in version 257.

       <u>RapidCommit=</u>
           Takes a boolean. The DHCPv6 client can obtain configuration parameters from a DHCPv6 server through a
           rapid two-message exchange (solicit and reply). When the rapid commit option is set by both the
           DHCPv6 client and the DHCPv6 server, the two-message exchange is used. Otherwise, the four-message
           exchange (solicit, advertise, request, and reply) is used. The two-message exchange provides faster
           client configuration. See <b>RFC</b> <b>3315</b>[34] for details. Defaults to true, and the two-message exchange
           will be used if the server support it.

           Added in version 252.

       <u>SendHostname=</u>
           When true (the default), the machine's hostname (or the value specified with <u>Hostname=</u>, described
           below) will be sent to the DHCPv6 server. Note that the hostname must consist only of 7-bit ASCII
           lower-case characters and no spaces or dots, and be formatted as a valid DNS domain name. Otherwise,
           the hostname is not sent even if this option is true.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>Hostname=</u>
           Use this value for the hostname which is sent to the DHCPv6 server, instead of machine's hostname.
           Note that the specified hostname must consist only of 7-bit ASCII lower-case characters and no spaces
           or dots, and be formatted as a valid DNS domain name.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>UseAddress=</u>
           When true (the default), the IP addresses provided by the DHCPv6 server will be assigned.

           Added in version 248.

       <u>UseCaptivePortal=</u>
           When true (the default), the captive portal advertised by the DHCPv6 server will be recorded and made
           available to client programs and displayed in the <b><a href="../man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl</a></b>(1) status output per-link.

           Added in version 254.

       <u>UseDelegatedPrefix=</u>
           When true (the default), the client will request the DHCPv6 server to delegate prefixes. If the
           server provides prefixes to be delegated, then subnets of the prefixes are assigned to the interfaces
           that have <u>DHCPPrefixDelegation=yes</u>. See also the <u>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</u> setting in the [Network]
           section, settings in the [DHCPPrefixDelegation] section, and <b>RFC</b> <b>8415</b>[35].

           Added in version 250.

       <u>UseDNS=</u>, <u>UseDNR=</u>, <u>UseNTP=</u>, <u>UseHostname=</u>, <u>UseDomains=</u>, <u>NetLabel=</u>, <u>SendRelease=</u>
           As in the [DHCPv4] section.

           Added in version 243.

       <u>NFTSet=</u>
           This applies the NFT set for the network configuration received with DHCP, like <u>NFTSet=</u> in [Address]
           section applies it to static configuration. See <u>NFTSet=</u> in [Address] section for more details. For
           "address" or "prefix" source types, the type of the element used in the NFT filter must be
           "ipv6_addr".

           Added in version 255.

       <u>WithoutRA=</u>
           Allows DHCPv6 client to start without router advertisements's "managed" or "other configuration"
           flag. Takes one of "no", "solicit", or "information-request". If this is not specified, "solicit" is
           used when <u>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</u> is enabled and <u>UplinkInterface=:self</u> is specified in the
           [DHCPPrefixDelegation] section. Otherwise, defaults to "no", and the DHCPv6 client will be started
           when an RA is received. See also the <u>DHCPv6Client=</u> setting in the [IPv6AcceptRA] section.

           Added in version 246.

</pre><h4><b>[DHCPPREFIXDELEGATION]</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The [DHCPPrefixDelegation] section configures subnet prefixes of the delegated prefixes acquired by a
       DHCPv6 client or by a DHCPv4 client through the 6RD option on another interface. The settings in this
       section are used only when the <u>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</u> setting in the [Network] section is enabled.

       <u>UplinkInterface=</u>
           Specifies the name or the index of the uplink interface, or one of the special values ":self" and
           ":auto". When ":self", the interface itself is considered the uplink interface, and <u>WithoutRA=solicit</u>
           is implied if the setting is not explicitly specified. When ":auto", the first link which acquired
           prefixes to be delegated from the DHCPv6 or DHCPv4 server is selected. Defaults to ":auto".

           Added in version 250.

       <u>SubnetId=</u>
           Configure a specific subnet ID on the interface from a (previously) received prefix delegation. You
           can either set "auto" (the default) or a specific subnet ID (as defined in <b>RFC</b> <b>4291</b>[36], section
           2.5.4), in which case the allowed value is hexadecimal, from 0 to 0x7fffffffffffffff inclusive.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>Announce=</u>
           Takes a boolean. When enabled, and <u>IPv6SendRA=</u> in [Network] section is enabled, the delegated
           prefixes are distributed through the IPv6 Router Advertisement. This setting will be ignored when the
           <u>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</u> setting is enabled on the upstream interface. Defaults to yes.

           Added in version 247.

       <u>Assign=</u>
           Takes a boolean. Specifies whether to add an address from the delegated prefixes which are received
           from the WAN interface by the DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation. When true (on LAN interface), the EUI-64
           algorithm will be used by default to form an interface identifier from the delegated prefixes. See
           also <u>Token=</u> setting below. Defaults to yes.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>Token=</u>
           Specifies an optional address generation mode for assigning an address in each delegated prefix. This
           accepts the same syntax as <u>Token=</u> in the [IPv6AcceptRA] section. If <u>Assign=</u> is set to false, then
           this setting will be ignored. Defaults to unset, which means the EUI-64 algorithm will be used.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>ManageTemporaryAddress=</u>
           As in the [Address] section, but defaults to true.

           Added in version 248.

       <u>RouteMetric=</u>
           The metric of the route to the delegated prefix subnet. Takes an unsigned integer in the range
           0...4294967295. When set to 0, the kernel's default value is used. Defaults to 256.

           Added in version 249.

       <u>NetLabel=</u>
           This applies the NetLabel for the addresses received with DHCP, like <u>NetLabel=</u> in [Address] section
           applies it to statically configured addresses. See <u>NetLabel=</u> in [Address] section for more details.

           Added in version 252.

       <u>NFTSet=</u>
           This applies the NFT set for the network configuration received with DHCP, like <u>NFTSet=</u> in [Address]
           section applies it to static configuration. See <u>NFTSet=</u> in [Address] section for more details. For
           "address" or "prefix" source types, the type of the element used in the NFT filter must be
           "ipv6_addr".

           Added in version 255.

</pre><h4><b>[IPV6ACCEPTRA]</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The [IPv6AcceptRA] section configures the IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) client, if it is enabled with
       the <u>IPv6AcceptRA=</u> setting described above:

       <u>UseRedirect=</u>
           When true (the default), Redirect message sent by the current first-hop router will be accepted, and
           routes to redirected nodes will be configured.

           Added in version 256.

       <u>Token=</u>
           Specifies an optional address generation mode for the Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).
           The following values are supported:

           <b>eui64</b>
               The EUI-64 algorithm will be used to generate an address for that prefix. Only supported by
               Ethernet or InfiniBand interfaces.

               Added in version 250.

           <b>static:</b><u>ADDRESS</u>
               An IPv6 address must be specified after a colon (":"), and the lower bits of the supplied address
               are combined with the upper bits of a prefix received in a Router Advertisement (RA) message to
               form a complete address. Note that if multiple prefixes are received in an RA message, or in
               multiple RA messages, addresses will be formed from each of them using the supplied address. This
               mode implements SLAAC but uses a static interface identifier instead of an identifier generated
               by using the EUI-64 algorithm. Because the interface identifier is static, if Duplicate Address
               Detection detects that the computed address is a duplicate (in use by another node on the link),
               then this mode will fail to provide an address for that prefix. If an IPv6 address without mode
               is specified, then "static" mode is assumed.

               Added in version 250.

           <b>prefixstable[:</b><u>ADDRESS</u><b>][,</b><u>UUID</u><b>]</b>
               The algorithm specified in <b>RFC</b> <b>7217</b>[37] will be used to generate interface identifiers. This mode
               can optionally take an IPv6 address separated with a colon (":"). If an IPv6 address is
               specified, then an interface identifier is generated only when a prefix received in an RA message
               matches the supplied address.

               This mode can also optionally take a non-null UUID in the format which <b>sd_id128_from_string()</b>
               accepts, e.g.  "86b123b969ba4b7eb8b3d8605123525a" or "86b123b9-69ba-4b7e-b8b3-d8605123525a". If a
               UUID is specified, the value is used as the secret key to generate interface identifiers. If not
               specified, then an application specific ID generated with the system's machine-ID will be used as
               the secret key. See <b><a href="../man3/sd-id128.3.html">sd-id128</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/sd_id128_from_string.3.html">sd_id128_from_string</a></b>(3), and <b><a href="../man3/sd_id128_get_machine.3.html">sd_id128_get_machine</a></b>(3).

               Note that the "prefixstable" algorithm uses both the interface name and MAC address as input to
               the hash to compute the interface identifier, so if either of those are changed the resulting
               interface identifier (and address) will be changed, even if the prefix received in the RA message
               has not been changed.

               Added in version 250.

           If no address generation mode is specified (which is the default), or a received prefix does not
           match any of the addresses provided in "prefixstable" mode, then the EUI-64 algorithm will be used
           for Ethernet or InfiniBand interfaces, otherwise "prefixstable" will be used to form an interface
           identifier for that prefix.

           This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is assigned, then the all previous
           assignments are cleared.

           Examples:

               Token=eui64
               Token=::1a:2b:3c:4d
               Token=static:::1a:2b:3c:4d
               Token=prefixstable
               Token=prefixstable:2002:da8:1::

           Added in version 250.

       <u>UseDNS=</u>
           When true (the default), the DNS servers received in the Router Advertisement will be used.

           This corresponds to the <b>nameserver</b> option in <b><a href="../man5/resolv.conf.5.html">resolv.conf</a></b>(5).

           Added in version 231.

       <u>UseDNR=</u>
           When true, the DNR servers received in the Router Advertisement will be used. Defaults to the value
           of <b>UseDNS=</b>.

           Added in version 257.

       <u>UseDomains=</u>
           Takes a boolean, or the special value "route". When true, the domain name received via IPv6 Router
           Advertisement (RA) will be used as DNS search domain over this link, similarly to the effect of the
           <b>Domains=</b> setting. If set to "route", the domain name received via IPv6 RA will be used for routing
           DNS queries only, but not for searching, similarly to the effect of the <b>Domains=</b> setting when the
           argument is prefixed with "~". Defaults to false.

           It is recommended to enable this option only on trusted networks, as setting this affects resolution
           of all hostnames, in particular of single-label names. It is generally safer to use the supplied
           domain only as routing domain, rather than as search domain, in order to not have it affect local
           resolution of single-label names.

           When set to true, this setting corresponds to the <b>domain</b> option in <b><a href="../man5/resolv.conf.5.html">resolv.conf</a></b>(5).

           Added in version 231.

       <u>RouteTable=num</u>
           The table identifier for the routes received in the Router Advertisement. Takes one of predefined
           names "default", "main", and "local", and names defined in <u>RouteTable=</u> in <b><a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf</a></b>(5), or a
           number between 1...4294967295.

           When used in combination with <u>VRF=</u>, the VRF's routing table is used when this parameter is not
           specified.

           Added in version 232.

       <u>RouteMetric=</u>
           Set the routing metric for the routes received in the Router Advertisement. Takes an unsigned integer
           in the range 0...4294967295, or three unsigned integer separated with ":", in that case the first one
           is used when the router preference is high, the second is for medium preference, and the last is for
           low preference ("<u>high</u>:<u>medium</u>:<u>low</u>"). Defaults to "512:1024:2048".

           Added in version 249.

       <u>QuickAck=</u>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the TCP quick ACK mode is enabled for the routes configured by the
           received RAs. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 253.

       <u>UseMTU=</u>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the MTU received in the Router Advertisement will be used. Defaults to
           true.

           Added in version 250.

       <u>UseHopLimit=</u>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the hop limit received in the Router Advertisement will be set to routes
           configured based on the advertisement. See also <u>IPv6HopLimit=</u>. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>UseReachableTime=</u>

           the interface receiving the advertisement. It is used as the base timespan of the validity of a
           neighbor entry. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 256.

       <u>UseRetransmissionTime=</u>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the retransmission time received in the Router Advertisement will be set
           on the interface receiving the advertisement. It is used as the time between retransmissions of
           Neighbor Solicitation messages to a neighbor when resolving the address or when probing the
           reachability of a neighbor. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 256.

           When true (the default), the router address will be configured as the default gateway.

           Added in version 250.

       <u>UseRoutePrefix=</u>
           When true (the default), the routes corresponding to the route prefixes received in the Router
           Advertisement will be configured.

           Added in version 250.

       <u>UseCaptivePortal=</u>
           When true (the default), the captive portal received in the Router Advertisement will be recorded and
           made available to client programs and displayed in the <b><a href="../man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl</a></b>(1) status output per-link.

           Added in version 254.

           When true, the IPv6 PREF64 (or NAT64) prefixes received in the Router Advertisement will be recorded
           and made available to client programs and displayed in the <b><a href="../man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl</a></b>(1) status output per-link. See
           <b>RFC</b> <b>8781</b>[38]. Defaults to false.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>UseAutonomousPrefix=</u>
           When true (the default), the autonomous prefix received in the Router Advertisement will be used and
           take precedence over any statically configured ones.

           Added in version 242.

       <u>UseOnLinkPrefix=</u>
           When true (the default), the onlink prefix received in the Router Advertisement will be used and
           takes precedence over any statically configured ones.

           Added in version 242.

       <u>RouterDenyList=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of IPv6 router addresses. Each address can optionally take a prefix
           length after "/". Any information advertised by the listed router is ignored.

           Added in version 248.

       <u>RouterAllowList=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of IPv6 router addresses. Each address can optionally take a prefix
           length after "/". Only information advertised by the listed router is accepted. Note that if

           A whitespace-separated list of IPv6 prefixes. Each prefix can optionally take its prefix length after
           "/". IPv6 prefixes supplied via router advertisements in the list are allowed. Note that if
           <u>PrefixAllowList=</u> is configured then <u>PrefixDenyList=</u> is ignored.

           Added in version 248.

       <u>RouteDenyList=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of IPv6 route prefixes. Each prefix can optionally take its prefix length
           after "/". IPv6 route prefixes supplied via router advertisements in the list are ignored.

           Added in version 248.

       <u>RouteAllowList=</u>
           A whitespace-separated list of IPv6 route prefixes. Each prefix can optionally take its prefix length

           Added in version 248.

       <u>DHCPv6Client=</u>
           Takes a boolean, or the special value "always". When true, the DHCPv6 client will be started in
           "solicit" mode if the RA has the "managed" flag or "information-request" mode if the RA lacks the
           "managed" flag but has the "other configuration" flag. If set to "always", the DHCPv6 client will be
           started in "solicit" mode when an RA is received, even if neither the "managed" nor the "other
           configuration" flag is set in the RA. This will be ignored when <u>WithoutRA=</u> in the [DHCPv6] section is

           section applies it to static configuration. See <u>NFTSet=</u> in [Address] section for more details. For
           "address" or "prefix" source types, the type of the element used in the NFT filter must be
           "ipv6_addr".

           Added in version 255.

</pre><h4><b>[DHCPSERVER]</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The [DHCPServer] section contains settings for the DHCP server, if enabled via the <u>DHCPServer=</u> option
       described above:

       <u>ServerAddress=</u>
           Specifies the server address for the DHCP server. Takes an IPv4 address with prefix length separated
           with a slash, e.g.  "192.168.0.1/24". Defaults to unset, and one of static IPv4 addresses configured
           in [Network] or [Address] section will be automatically selected. This setting may be useful when the
           interface on which the DHCP server is running has multiple static IPv4 addresses.

           This implies <u>Address=</u> in [Network] or [Address] section with the same address and prefix length. That
           is,

               [Network]
               DHCPServer=yes
               Address=192.168.0.1/24
               Address=192.168.0.2/24
               [DHCPServer]
               ServerAddress=192.168.0.1/24

           or

               [Network]
               DHCPServer=yes
               [Address]
               Address=192.168.0.1/24
               [Address]
               Address=192.168.0.2/24
               [DHCPServer]
               ServerAddress=192.168.0.1/24

           are equivalent to the following:

               [Network]
               DHCPServer=yes
               Address=192.168.0.2/24
               [DHCPServer]
               ServerAddress=192.168.0.1/24

           Since version 255, like the <u>Address=</u> setting in [Network] or [Address] section, this also supports a
           null address, e.g.  "0.0.0.0/24", and an unused address will be automatically selected. For more
           details about the automatic address selection, see <u>Address=</u> setting in [Network] section in the
           above.

           Added in version 249.

       <u>PoolOffset=</u>, <u>PoolSize=</u>
           Configures the pool of addresses to hand out. The pool is a contiguous sequence of IP addresses in
           the subnet configured for the server address, which does not include the subnet nor the broadcast
           address.  <u>PoolOffset=</u> takes the offset of the pool from the start of subnet, or zero to use the
           default value.  <u>PoolSize=</u> takes the number of IP addresses in the pool or zero to use the default
           value. By default, the pool starts at the first address after the subnet address and takes up the
           rest of the subnet, excluding the broadcast address. If the pool includes the server address (the
           default), this is reserved and not handed out to clients.

           Added in version 226.

       <u>DefaultLeaseTimeSec=</u>, <u>MaxLeaseTimeSec=</u>
           Control the default and maximum DHCP lease time to pass to clients. These settings take time values
           in seconds or another common time unit, depending on the suffix. The default lease time is used for
           clients that did not ask for a specific lease time. If a client asks for a lease time longer than the
           maximum lease time, it is automatically shortened to the specified time. The default lease time
           defaults to 1h, the maximum lease time to 12h. Shorter lease times are beneficial if the
           configuration data in DHCP leases changes frequently and clients shall learn the new settings with
           shorter latencies. Longer lease times reduce the generated DHCP network traffic.

           Added in version 226.

       <u>UplinkInterface=</u>
           Specifies the name or the index of the uplink interface, or one of the special values ":none" and
           ":auto". When emitting DNS, NTP, or SIP servers is enabled but no servers are specified, the servers
           configured in the uplink interface will be emitted. When ":auto", the link which has a default
           gateway with the highest priority will be automatically selected. When ":none", no uplink interface
           will be selected. Defaults to ":auto".

           Added in version 249.

       <u>EmitDNS=</u>, <u>DNS=</u>
           <u>EmitDNS=</u> takes a boolean. Configures whether the DHCP leases handed out to clients shall contain DNS
           server information. Defaults to "yes". The DNS servers to pass to clients may be configured with the
           <u>DNS=</u> option, which takes a list of IPv4 addresses, or special value "_server_address" which will be
           converted to the address used by the DHCP server.

           If the <u>EmitDNS=</u> option is enabled but no servers configured, the servers are automatically propagated
           from an "uplink" interface that has appropriate servers set. The "uplink" interface is determined by
           the default route of the system with the highest priority. Note that this information is acquired at
           the time the lease is handed out, and does not take uplink interfaces into account that acquire DNS
           server information at a later point. If no suitable uplink interface is found the DNS server data
           from <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> is used. Also, note that the leases are not refreshed if the uplink network
           configuration changes. To ensure clients regularly acquire the most current uplink DNS server
           information, it is thus advisable to shorten the DHCP lease time via <u>MaxLeaseTimeSec=</u> described
           above.

           This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is specified, then all DNS servers
           specified earlier are cleared.

           Added in version 226.

       <u>EmitNTP=</u>, <u>NTP=</u>, <u>EmitSIP=</u>, <u>SIP=</u>, <u>EmitPOP3=</u>, <u>POP3=</u>, <u>EmitSMTP=</u>, <u>SMTP=</u>, <u>EmitLPR=</u>, <u>LPR=</u>
           Similar to the <u>EmitDNS=</u> and <u>DNS=</u> settings described above, these settings configure whether and what
           server information for the indicate protocol shall be emitted as part of the DHCP lease. The same
           syntax, propagation semantics and defaults apply as for <u>EmitDNS=</u> and <u>DNS=</u>.

           Added in version 226.

       <u>EmitRouter=</u>, <u>Router=</u>
           The <u>EmitRouter=</u> setting takes a boolean value, and configures whether the DHCP lease should contain
           the router option. The <u>Router=</u> setting takes an IPv4 address, and configures the router address to be
           emitted. When the <u>Router=</u> setting is not specified, then the server address will be used for the
           router option. When the <u>EmitRouter=</u> setting is disabled, the <u>Router=</u> setting will be ignored. The
           <u>EmitRouter=</u> setting defaults to true, and the <u>Router=</u> setting defaults to unset.

           Added in version 230.

       <u>EmitTimezone=</u>, <u>Timezone=</u>
           Takes a boolean. Configures whether the DHCP leases handed out to clients shall contain timezone
           information. Defaults to "yes". The <u>Timezone=</u> setting takes a timezone string (such as
           "Europe/Berlin" or "UTC") to pass to clients. If no explicit timezone is set, the system timezone of
           the local host is propagated, as determined by the <a href="file:/etc/localtime">/etc/localtime</a> symlink.

           Added in version 226.

       <u>BootServerAddress=</u>
           Takes an IPv4 address of the boot server used by e.g. PXE boot systems. When specified, this address
           is sent in the <b>siaddr</b> field of the DHCP message header. See <b>RFC</b> <b>2131</b>[39] for more details. Defaults
           to unset.

           Added in version 251.

       <u>BootServerName=</u>
           Takes a name of the boot server used by e.g. PXE boot systems. When specified, this name is sent in
           the DHCP option 66 ("TFTP server name"). See <b>RFC</b> <b>2132</b>[40] for more details. Defaults to unset.

           Note that typically setting one of <u>BootServerName=</u> or <u>BootServerAddress=</u> is sufficient, but both can
           be set too, if desired.

           Added in version 251.

       <u>BootFilename=</u>
           Takes a path or URL to a file loaded by e.g. a PXE boot loader. When specified, this path is sent in
           the DHCP option 67 ("Bootfile name"). See <b>RFC</b> <b>2132</b>[40] for more details. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 251.

       <u>IPv6OnlyPreferredSec=</u>
           Takes a timespan. Controls the <b>RFC</b> <b>8925</b>[33] IPv6-Only Preferred option. Specifies the DHCPv4 option
           to indicate that a host supports an IPv6-only mode and is willing to forgo obtaining an IPv4 address
           if the network provides IPv6 connectivity. Defaults to unset, and not send the option. The minimum
           allowed value is 300 seconds.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>SendOption=</u>
           Send a raw option with value via DHCPv4 server. Takes a DHCP option number, data type and data
           ("<u>option</u>:<u>type</u>:<u>value</u>"). The option number is an integer in the range 1...254. The type takes one of
           "uint8", "uint16", "uint32", "ipv4address", "ipv6address", or "string". Special characters in the
           data string may be escaped using <b>C-style</b> <b>escapes</b>[28]. This setting can be specified multiple times.
           If an empty string is specified, then all options specified earlier are cleared. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 244.

       <u>SendVendorOption=</u>
           Send a vendor option with value via DHCPv4 server. Takes a DHCP option number, data type and data
           ("<u>option</u>:<u>type</u>:<u>value</u>"). The option number is an integer in the range 1...254. The type takes one of
           "uint8", "uint16", "uint32", "ipv4address", or "string". Special characters in the data string may be
           escaped using <b>C-style</b> <b>escapes</b>[28]. This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty string
           is specified, then all options specified earlier are cleared. Defaults to unset.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>BindToInterface=</u>
           Takes a boolean value. When "yes", DHCP server socket will be bound to its network interface and all
           socket communication will be restricted to this interface. Defaults to "yes", except if <u>RelayTarget=</u>
           is used (see below), in which case it defaults to "no".

           Added in version 249.

       <u>RelayTarget=</u>
           Takes an IPv4 address, which must be in the format described in <b><a href="../man3/inet_pton.3.html">inet_pton</a></b>(3). Turns this DHCP server
           into a DHCP relay agent. See <b>RFC</b> <b>1542</b>[41]. The address is the address of DHCP server or another relay
           agent to forward DHCP messages to and from.

           Added in version 249.

       <u>RelayAgentCircuitId=</u>
           Specifies value for Agent Circuit ID suboption of Relay Agent Information option. Takes a string,
           which must be in the format "string:<u>value</u>", where "<u>value</u>" should be replaced with the value of the
           suboption. Defaults to unset (means no Agent Circuit ID suboption is generated). Ignored if
           <u>RelayTarget=</u> is not specified.

           Added in version 249.

       <u>RelayAgentRemoteId=</u>
           Specifies value for Agent Remote ID suboption of Relay Agent Information option. Takes a string,
           which must be in the format "string:<u>value</u>", where "<u>value</u>" should be replaced with the value of the
           suboption. Defaults to unset (means no Agent Remote ID suboption is generated). Ignored if
           <u>RelayTarget=</u> is not specified.

           Added in version 249.

       <u>RapidCommit=</u>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the server supports <b>RFC</b> <b>4039</b>[42]. When a client sends a DHCPDISCOVER
           message with the Rapid Commit option to the server, then the server will reply with a DHCPACK message
           to the client, instead of DHCPOFFER. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>PersistLeases=</u>
           Takes a boolean. When true, the DHCP server will load and save leases in the persistent storage. When
           false, the DHCP server will neither load nor save leases in the persistent storage. Hence, bound
           leases will be lost when the interface is reconfigured e.g. by <b>networkctl</b> <b>reconfigure</b>, or <b><a href="../man8/systemdnetworkd.service.8.html">systemd-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man8/systemdnetworkd.service.8.html">networkd.service</a></b>(8) is restarted. That may cause address conflict on the network. So, please take an
           extra care when disable this setting. When unspecified, the value specified in the same setting in
           <b><a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf</a></b>(5), which defaults to "yes", will be used.

           Added in version 256.

</pre><h4><b>[DHCPSERVERSTATICLEASE]</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The "[DHCPServerStaticLease]" section configures a static DHCP lease to assign a fixed IPv4 address to a
       specific device based on its MAC address. This section can be specified multiple times.

       <u>MACAddress=</u>
           The hardware address of a device to match. This key is mandatory.

           Added in version 249.

       <u>Address=</u>
           The IPv4 address that should be assigned to the device that was matched with <u>MACAddress=</u>. This key is
           mandatory.

           Added in version 249.

</pre><h4><b>[IPV6SENDRA]</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The [IPv6SendRA] section contains settings for sending IPv6 Router Advertisements and whether to act as a
       router, if enabled via the <u>IPv6SendRA=</u> option described above. IPv6 network prefixes or routes are
       defined with one or more [IPv6Prefix] or [IPv6RoutePrefix] sections.

       <u>Managed=</u>, <u>OtherInformation=</u>
           Takes a boolean. Controls whether a DHCPv6 server is used to acquire IPv6 addresses on the network
           link when <u>Managed=</u> is set to "true" or if only additional network information can be obtained via
           DHCPv6 for the network link when <u>OtherInformation=</u> is set to "true". Both settings default to
           "false", which means that a DHCPv6 server is not being used.

           Added in version 235.

       <u>RouterLifetimeSec=</u>
           Takes a timespan. Configures the IPv6 router lifetime in seconds. The value must be 0 seconds, or
           between 4 seconds and 9000 seconds. When set to 0, the host is not acting as a router. Defaults to
           1800 seconds (30 minutes).

           Added in version 235.

       <u>ReachableTimeSec=</u>
           Configures the time, used in the Neighbor Unreachability Detection algorithm, for which clients can
           assume a neighbor is reachable after having received a reachability confirmation. Takes a time span
           in the range 0...4294967295 ms. When 0, clients will handle it as if the value was not specified.
           Defaults to 0.

           Added in version 256.

       <u>RetransmitSec=</u>
           Configures the time, used in the Neighbor Unreachability Detection algorithm, for which clients can
           use as retransmit time on address resolution and the Neighbor Unreachability Detection algorithm.
           Takes a time span in the range 0...4294967295 ms. When 0, clients will handle it as if the value
           wasn't specified. Defaults to 0.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>RouterPreference=</u>
           Configures IPv6 router preference if <u>RouterLifetimeSec=</u> is non-zero. Valid values are "high",
           "medium" and "low", with "normal" and "default" added as synonyms for "medium" just to make
           configuration easier. See <b>RFC</b> <b>4191</b>[24] for details. Defaults to "medium".

           Added in version 235.

       <u>HopLimit=</u>
           Configures hop limit. Takes an integer in the range 0...255. See also <u>IPv6HopLimit=</u>.

           Added in version 255.

       <u>UplinkInterface=</u>
           Specifies the name or the index of the uplink interface, or one of the special values ":none" and

           same setting in the [DHCPPrefixDelegation] section will be used if <u>DHCPPrefixDelegation=</u> is enabled,
           otherwise the link which has a default gateway with the highest priority will be automatically
           selected. When ":none", no uplink interface will be selected. Defaults to ":auto".

           Added in version 250.

       <u>EmitDNS=</u>, <u>DNS=</u>
           <u>DNS=</u> specifies a list of recursive DNS server IPv6 addresses that are distributed via Router
           Advertisement messages when <u>EmitDNS=</u> is true.  <u>DNS=</u> also takes special value "_link_local"; in that
           case the IPv6 link-local address is distributed. If <u>DNS=</u> is empty, DNS servers are read from the
           [Network] section. If the [Network] section does not contain any DNS servers either, DNS servers from
           the uplink interface specified in <u>UplinkInterface=</u> will be used. When <u>EmitDNS=</u> is false, no DNS
           server information is sent in Router Advertisement messages.  <u>EmitDNS=</u> defaults to true.

           Added in version 243.

       <u>Cost=</u>
           Sets the "cost" of sending packets of this interface. Each port in a bridge may have a different
           speed and the cost is used to decide which link to use. Faster interfaces should have lower costs. It
           is an integer value between 1 and 65535.

           Added in version 218.

       <u>Priority=</u>
           Sets the "priority" of sending packets on this interface. Each port in a bridge may have a different
           priority which is used to decide which link to use. Lower value means higher priority. It is an
           integer value between 0 to 63.  <b>systemd-networkd</b> does not set any default, meaning the kernel default
           value of 32 is used.

           Added in version 234.

           Specifies the time quanta, propagation segment, phase buffer segment 1 and 2, and the synchronization
           jump width, which allow one to define the CAN bit-timing in a hardware independent format as proposed
           by the Bosch CAN 2.0 Specification.  <u>TimeQuantaNSec=</u> takes a timespan in nanoseconds.
           <u>PropagationSegment=</u>, <u>PhaseBufferSegment1=</u>, <u>PhaseBufferSegment2=</u>, and <u>SyncJumpWidth=</u> take number of
           time quantum specified in <u>TimeQuantaNSec=</u> and must be an unsigned integer in the range

           Added in version 246.

       <u>Loopback=</u>
           Takes a boolean. When "yes", loopback mode is enabled. When the loopback mode is enabled, the
           interface treats messages transmitted by itself as received messages. The loopback mode is important
           to debug CAN networks. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

           Added in version 250.

       <u>OneShot=</u>

</pre><h4><b>[IPOIB]</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The [IPoIB] section manages the IP over Infiniband and accepts the following keys:

       <u>Mode=</u>
           Takes one of the special values "datagram" or "connected". Defaults to unset, and the kernel's
           default is used.

           When "datagram", the Infiniband unreliable datagram (UD) transport is used, and so the interface MTU
           is equal to the IB L2 MTU minus the IPoIB encapsulation header (4 bytes). For example, in a typical
           IB fabric with a 2K MTU, the IPoIB MTU will be 2048 - 4 = 2044 bytes.

           When "connected", the Infiniband reliable connected (RC) transport is used. Connected mode takes
           advantage of the connected nature of the IB transport and allows an MTU up to the maximal IP packet
           size of 64K, which reduces the number of IP packets needed for handling large UDP datagrams, TCP

</pre><h4><b>[BRIDGEVLAN]</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The [BridgeVLAN] section manages the VLAN ID configurations of a bridge master or port, and accepts the
       following keys. To make the settings in this section take an effect, <u>VLANFiltering=</u> option has to be
       enabled on the bridge master, see the [Bridge] section in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.netdev.5.html">systemd.netdev</a></b>(5). If at least one valid
       settings specified in this section in a .network file for an interface, all assigned VLAN IDs on the
       interface that are not configured in the .network file will be removed. If VLAN IDs on an interface need
       to be managed by other tools, then the settings in this section cannot be used in the matching .network
       file.

       <u>VLAN=</u>
           The VLAN ID allowed on the port. This can be either a single ID or a range M-N. Takes an integer in
           the range 1...4094. This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is assigned,
           then the all previous assignments are cleared.

           Added in version 231.

       <u>EgressUntagged=</u>
           The VLAN ID specified here will be used to untag frames on egress. Configuring <u>EgressUntagged=</u>
           implicates the use of <u>VLAN=</u> above and will enable the VLAN ID for ingress as well. This can be either
           a single ID or a range M-N. This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is
           assigned, then the all previous assignments are cleared.

           Added in version 231.

       <u>PVID=</u>
           The port VLAN ID specified here is assigned to all untagged frames at ingress. Takes an VLAN ID or
           negative boolean value (e.g.  "no"). When false, the currently assigned port VLAN ID will be dropped.
           Configuring <u>PVID=</u> implicates the use of <u>VLAN=</u> setting in the above and will enable the VLAN ID for
           ingress as well. Defaults to unset, and will keep the assigned port VLAN ID if exists.

           Added in version 231.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Example</b> <b>1.</b> <b>Static</b> <b>network</b> <b>configuration</b>

           # /etc/systemd/network/50-static.network
           [Match]
           Name=enp2s0

           [Network]
           Address=192.168.0.15/24
           Gateway=192.168.0.1

       This brings interface "enp2s0" up with a static address. The specified gateway will be used for a default
       route.

       <b>Example</b> <b>2.</b> <b>DHCP</b> <b>on</b> <b>ethernet</b> <b>links</b>

           # /etc/systemd/network/80-dhcp.network
           [Match]
           Name=en*

           [Network]
           DHCP=yes

       This will enable DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 on all interfaces with names starting with "en" (i.e. ethernet
       interfaces).

       <b>Example</b> <b>3.</b> <b>IPv6</b> <b>Prefix</b> <b>Delegation</b> <b>(DHCPv6</b> <b>PD)</b>

           UplinkInterface=enp1s0
           SubnetId=1
           Announce=yes

       This will enable DHCPv6-PD on the interface enp1s0 as an upstream interface where the DHCPv6 client is
       running and enp2s0 as a downstream interface where the prefix is delegated to. The delegated prefixes are
       distributed by IPv6 Router Advertisement on the downstream network.

       <b>Example</b> <b>4.</b> <b>IPv6</b> <b>Prefix</b> <b>Delegation</b> <b>(DHCPv4</b> <b>6RD)</b>

           # It is expected that the host is acting as a router. So, usually it is not
           # necessary to receive Router Advertisement from other hosts in the downstream network.
           IPv6AcceptRA=no

           [DHCPPrefixDelegation]
           UplinkInterface=enp1s0
           SubnetId=1
           Announce=yes

       This will enable DHCPv4-6RD on the interface enp1s0 as an upstream interface where the DHCPv4 client is
       running and enp2s0 as a downstream interface where the prefix is delegated to. The delegated prefixes are
       distributed by IPv6 Router Advertisement on the downstream network.

       <b>Example</b> <b>5.</b> <b>A</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>enslaved</b> <b>links</b>

           [Match]
           Name=wlp3s0

           [Network]
           Bridge=bridge0

       This creates a bridge and attaches devices "enp2s0" and "wlp3s0" to it. The bridge will have the
       specified static address and network assigned, and a default route via the specified gateway will be
       added. The specified DNS server will be added to the global list of DNS resolvers.

       <b>Example</b> <b>6.</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>port</b> <b>with</b> <b>VLAN</b> <b>forwarding</b>

           # /etc/systemd/network/25-bridge-slave-interface-1.network

           EgressUntagged=42

           [BridgeVLAN]
           VLAN=100-299

           [BridgeVLAN]
           EgressUntagged=300-400

       This overrides the configuration specified in the previous example for the interface "enp2s0", and
       enables VLAN on that bridge port. VLAN IDs 1-32, 42, 100-400 will be allowed. Packets tagged with VLAN
       IDs 42, 300-400 will be untagged when they leave on this interface. Untagged packets which arrive on this
       interface will be assigned VLAN ID 42.

       <b>Example</b> <b>7.</b> <b>Various</b> <b>tunnels</b>

           [NetDev]
           Name=vti-tun
           Kind=vti

       This will bring interface "ens1" up and create an IPIP tunnel, a SIT tunnel, a GRE tunnel, and a VTI
       tunnel using it.

       <b>Example</b> <b>8.</b> <b>A</b> <b>bond</b> <b>device</b>

           [Network]
           Bond=bond1

       This will create a bond device "bond1" and enslave the two devices with MAC addresses 52:54:00:e9:64:41
       and 52:54:00:e9:64:42 to it. IPv6 DHCP will be used to acquire an address.

       <b>Example</b> <b>9.</b> <b>Virtual</b> <b>Routing</b> <b>and</b> <b>Forwarding</b> <b>(VRF)</b>

       Add the "bond1" interface to the VRF master interface "vrf1". This will redirect routes generated on this
       interface to be within the routing table defined during VRF creation. For kernels before 4.8 traffic will
       not be redirected towards the VRFs routing table unless specific ip-rules are added.

       This creates a "xfrm0" interface and binds it to the "eth0" device. This allows hardware based ipsec
       offloading to the "eth0" nic. If offloading is not needed, xfrm interfaces can be assigned to the "lo"
       device.
