</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       shard.yml - metadata for projects managed by <a href="../man1/shards.1.html">shards</a>(1)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The file <u>shard.yml</u> is a YAML file with metadata about a project managed by shards, known as a <b>shard</b>. It
       must contain at least <u>name</u> and <u>version</u> attributes plus optional additional attributes.

       Both libraries and applications will benefit from shard.yml.

       The metadata for libraries are expected to have more information (e.g., list of authors, description,
       license) than applications that may only have a name, version and dependencies.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The file must be named <u>shard.yml</u> and be a valid YAML file with UTF-8 encoding. It must not contain
       duplicate attributes in any mapping. It should use an indent of 2 spaces. It should not use advanced YAML
       features, only simple mappings, sequences and strings (Failsafe Schema).

</pre><h4><b>REQUIRED</b> <b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>name</b>
           The name of the project (string, required).

           •   It must be unique.

           •   It must be 50 characters or less.

           •   It should be lowercase (a-z).

           •   It should not contain <u>crystal</u>.

           •   It may contain digits (0-9) but not start with one.

           •   It may contain underscores or dashes but not start/end with one.

           •   It must not have consecutive underscores or dashes.

           Examples: <u>minitest</u>, <u>mysql2</u>, <u>battery-horse</u>.

       <b>version</b>
           The version number of the project (string, required).

           •   It must contain digits.

           •   It may contain dots and dashes but not consecutive ones.

           •   It may contain a letter to make it a 'prerelease'.

           Examples: <u>1.2.3</u>, <u>2.0.0.1</u>, <u>1.0.0.alpha</u> <u>2.0.0-rc1</u> or <u>2016.09</u>.

           While Shards doesn’t enforce it, following a rational versioning scheme like Semantic Versioning
           &lt;<a href="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org/</a>&gt; or Calendar Versioning &lt;<a href="http://calver.org/">http://calver.org/</a>&gt; is highly recommended.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONAL</b> <b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>authors</b>
           A list of authors, along with their contact email (optional) (sequence of string).

           •   Each author must have a name.

           •   Each author may have an email address, within angle bracket (<u>&lt;</u> and <u>&gt;</u>) chars.

           <b>Example:</b>

               authors:
               - Ary
               - Julien Portalier &lt;<a href="mailto:julien@example.org">julien@example.org</a>&gt;

       <b>crystal</b>
           A restriction to indicate which are the supported crystal versions. This will usually express a lower
           and upper-bound constraints (string, recommended)

           When resolving dependencies, this information is not used. After dependencies have been determined
           shards checks all of them are expected to work with the current crystal version. If not, a warning
           appears for the offending dependencies. The resolved versions are installed and can be used at your
           own risk.

           The valid values are mostly the same as for <u>dependencies.version</u>:

           •   A version number prefixed by an operator: <u>&lt;</u>, <u>&lt;=</u>, <u>&gt;</u>, <u>&gt;=</u>, <u>!=</u> or <u>~&gt;</u>.

           •   Just <u>"*"</u> if any version will do (this is the default if unspecified).

           •   Multiple requirements can be separated by commas.

           There is a special legacy behavior (its use is discouraged) when just a version number is used as the
           value: it works exactly the same as a &gt;= check: <u>x.y.z</u> is interpreted as <u>"&gt;=</u> <u>x.y.z"</u>

           You are welcome to also specify the upper bound to be lower than the next (future) major Crystal
           version, because there’s no guarantee that it won’t break your library.

           <b>Example:</b>

               crystal: "&gt;= 0.35, &lt; 2.0"

       <b>dependencies</b>
           A list of required dependencies (mapping).

           Each dependency begins with the name of the dependency as a key (string) then a list of attributes
           (mapping) that depend on the resolver type.

           <b>Example:</b>

               dependencies:
                 minitest:
                   github: ysbaddaden/minitest.cr
                   version: 0.1.0

       <b>development_dependencies</b>
           A list of dependencies required to work on the project, but not necessary to build and run the
           project (mapping).

           They will be installed for the main project or library itself. When the library is installed as a
           dependency for another project the development dependencies will never be installed.

           Development dependencies follow the same scheme as dependencies.

           <b>Example:</b>

               development_dependencies:
                 minitest:
                   github: ysbaddaden/minitest.cr
                   version: ~&gt; 0.1.3

       <b>description</b>
           A single line description of the project (string, recommended).

       <b>documentation</b>
           The URL to a website providing the project’s documentation for online browsing (string).

       <b>executables</b>
           A list of executables to be installed (sequence).

           The executables can be of any type or language (e.g., shell, binary, ruby), must exist in the <u>bin</u>
           folder of the Shard, and have the executable bit set (on POSIX platforms). When installed as a
           dependency for another project the executables will be copied to the <u>bin</u> folder of that project.

           Executables are always installed last, after the <u>postinstall</u> script is run, so libraries can build
           the executables when they are installed by Shards. Installation can be disabled by passing the flag
           <u>--skip-executables</u>.

           <b>Example:</b>

               executables:
               - micrate
               - icr

       <b>homepage</b>
           The URL of the project’s homepage (string).

       <b>libraries</b>
           A list of shared libraries the shard tries to link to (mapping).

           This field is purely informational. It serves as a canonical way to discover non Crystal dependencies
           in shards, both for tools as well as humans.

           A shard must only list libraries it directly links to, it must not include libraries that are only
           referenced by dependencies. It must include all libraries it directly links to, regardless of a
           dependency doing it too.

           It should map from the soname without any extension, path or version, for example <u>libsqlite3</u> for
           <u>/usr/lib/libsqlite3.so.0.8.6</u>, to a version constraint.

           The version constraint has the following format:

           •   It may be a version number.

           •   It may be <u>"*"</u> if any version will do.

           •   The version number may be prefixed by an operator: <u>&lt;</u>, <u>&lt;=</u>, <u>&gt;</u>, <u>&gt;=</u>, <u>!=</u> or <u>~&gt;</u>.

               libraries:
                 libQt5Gui: "*"
                 libQt5Help: "~&gt; 5.7"
                 libQtBus: "&gt;= 4.8"

       <b>license</b>
           An SPDX license expression
           &lt;https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/annexes/spdx-license-expressions/&gt; or an URL to a license
           file (string, recommended).

           The OSI publishes a list &lt;https://opensource.org/licenses-old/category&gt; of open source licenses and
           their corresponding SPDX identifiers.

           Examples: <u>Apache-2.0</u>, <u>GPL-3.0-or-later</u>, <u>Apache-2.0</u> <u>OR</u> <u>MIT</u>, <u>Apache-2.0</u> <u>WITH</u> <u>Swift-exception</u>,
           https://example.com/LICENSE.

       <b>repository</b>
           The URL of the project’s canonical repository (string, recommended).

           The URL should be compatible with typical VCS tools without modifications. <u>http</u>/<u>https</u> is preferred
           over VCS schemes like <u>git</u>. It is recommended that this URL is publicly available.

           Copies of a shard (such as mirrors, development forks etc.) should point to the same canonical
           repository address, even if hosted at different locations.

           <b>Example:</b>

               repository: "https://github.com/crystal-lang/shards"

       <b>scripts</b>
           Script hooks to run. Only <u>postinstall</u> is supported.

           Shards may run scripts automatically after certain actions. The scripts themselves are mere shell
           commands.

           <b>postinstall</b>
               The <u>postinstall</u> hook of a dependency will be run whenever that dependency is installed or
               upgraded in a project that requires it. This may be used to compile a C library, to build tools
               to help working on the project, or anything else.

               The script will be run from the dependency’s installation directory, for example <u>lib/foo</u> for a
               Shard named <u>foo</u>.

               <b>Example:</b>

                   scripts:
                     postinstall: cd src/libfoo &amp;&amp; make

       <b>targets</b>
           A list of targets to build (mapping).

           Each target begins with the name of the target as a key (string), then a list of attributes
           (mapping). The target name is the built binary name, created in the <u>bin</u> folder of the project.

           <b>Example:</b>

               targets:
                 server:
                   main: src/server/cli.cr
                 worker:
                   main: src/worker.cr

           The above example will build <u>bin/server</u> from <u>src/server/cli.cr</u> and <u>bin/worker</u> from <u>src/worker.cr</u>.

           <b>main</b>
               A path to the source file to compile (string).

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCY</b> <b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       Each dependency needs at least one attribute that defines the resolver for this dependency. Those can be
       <u>path</u>, <u>git</u>, <u>github</u>, <u>gitlab</u>, <u>bitbucket</u>, <u>codeberg</u>.

       <b>path</b>
           A local path (string).

           The library will be installed as a symlink to the local path. The <u>version</u> attribute isn’t required
           but will be used if present to validate the dependency.

       <b>git</b>
           A Git repository URL (string).

           The URL may be any protocol &lt;https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#_git_urls&gt; supported by Git, which
           includes SSH, GIT and HTTPS.

           The Git repository will be cloned, the list of versions (and associated <u>shard.yml</u>) will be extracted
           from Git tags (e.g., <u>v1.2.3</u>).

           One of the other attributes (<u>version</u>, <u>tag</u>, <u>branch</u> or <u>commit</u>) is required. When missing, Shards will
           install the HEAD refs.

           <b>Example:</b> <u>git:</u> <u>git://git.example.org/crystal-library.git</u>

       <b>github</b>
           GitHub repository URL as <u>user/repo</u> (string)

           Extends the <u>git</u> resolver, and acts exactly like it.

           <b>Example:</b> <u>github:</u> <u>ysbaddaden/minitest.cr</u>

       <b>gitlab</b>
           GitLab repository URL as <u>user/repo</u> (string).

           Extends the <u>git</u> resolver, and acts exactly like it.

           Only matches dependencies hosted on <u>gitlab.com</u>. For personal GitLab installations, you must use the
           generic <u>git</u> resolver.

           <b>Example:</b> <u>gitlab:</u> <u>thelonlyghost/minitest.cr</u>

       <b>bitbucket</b>
           Bitbucket repository URL as <u>user/repo</u> (string).

           Extends the <u>git</u> resolver, and acts exactly like it.

           <b>Example:</b> <u>bitbucket:</u> <u>tom/library</u>

       <b>codeberg</b>
           Codeberg repository URL as <u>user/repo</u> (string).

           Extends the <u>git</u> resolver, and acts exactly like it.

           <b>Example:</b> <u>codeberg:</u> <u>tom/library</u>

       <b>hg</b>
           A Mercurial repository URL (string).

           The URL may be any protocol &lt;https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/help/clone&gt; supported by
           Mercurial, which includes SSH and HTTPS.

           The Mercurial repository will be cloned, the list of versions (and associated <u>shard.yml</u>) will be
           extracted from Mercurial tags (e.g., <u>v1.2.3</u>).

           One of the other attributes (<u>version</u>, <u>tag</u>, <u>branch</u>, <u>bookmark</u> or <u>commit</u>) is required. When missing,
           Shards will install the <u>@</u> bookmark or <u>tip</u>.

           <b>Example:</b> <u>hg:</u> https://hg.example.org/crystal-library

       <b>fossil</b>
           A Fossil &lt;https://www.fossil-scm.org&gt; repository URL (string).

           The URL may be any protocol &lt;https://fossil-scm.org/home/help/clone&gt; supported by Fossil, which
           includes SSH and HTTPS.

           The Fossil repository will be cloned, the list of versions (and associated <u>shard.yml</u>) will be
           extracted from Fossil tags (e.g., <u>v1.2.3</u>).

           One of the other attributes (<u>version</u>, <u>tag</u>, <u>branch</u>, or <u>commit</u>) is required. When missing, Shards will
           install <u>trunk</u>.

           <b>Example:</b> <u>fossil:</u> https://fossil.example.org/crystal-library

       <b>version</b>
           A version requirement (string).

           •   It may be an explicit version number.

           •   It may be <u>"*"</u> wildcard if any version will do (this is the default). Shards will then install the
               latest tagged version (or HEAD if no tagged version available).

           •   The version number may be prefixed by an operator: <u>&lt;</u>, <u>&lt;=</u>, <u>&gt;</u>, <u>&gt;=</u>, <u>!=</u> or <u>~&gt;</u>.

           •   Multiple requirements can be separated by commas.

           Examples: <u>1.2.3</u>, <u>&gt;=</u> <u>1.0.0</u>, <u>&gt;=</u> <u>1.0.0,</u> <u>&lt;</u> <u>2.0</u> or <u>~&gt;</u> <u>2.0</u>.

           Most of the version operators, like <u>&gt;=</u> <u>1.0.0</u>, are self-explanatory, but the <u>~&gt;</u> operator has a special
           meaning. It specifies a minimum version, but allows the last digit specified to go up, excluding the
           major release number:

       •   <u>~&gt;</u> <u>0.3.5</u> is identical to <u>&gt;=</u> <u>0.3.5</u> <u>and</u> <u>&lt;</u> <u>0.4.0</u>.

       •   <u>~&gt;</u> <u>2.0.3</u> is identical to <u>&gt;=</u> <u>2.0.3</u> <u>and</u> <u>&lt;</u> <u>2.1</u>.

       •   <u>~&gt;</u> <u>2.1</u> is identical to <u>&gt;=</u> <u>2.1</u> <u>and</u> <u>&lt;</u> <u>3.0</u>.

       •   <u>~&gt;</u> <u>0.3</u> is identical to <u>&gt;=</u> <u>0.3</u> <u>and</u> <u>&lt;</u> <u>1.0</u>.

       •   <u>~&gt;</u> <u>1</u> is identical to <u>&gt;=</u> <u>1.0</u> <u>and</u> <u>&lt;</u> <u>2.0</u>.

           <b>Note</b>

           Even though <u>2.1.0-dev</u> is strictly before <u>2.1.0</u>, a version constraint like <u>~&gt;</u> <u>2.0.3</u> would not install
           it since only the <u>.3</u> can change but the <u>2.0</u> part is fixed.

       <b>branch</b>
           Install the specified branch of a git dependency, or the named branch of a mercurial or fossil
           dependency (string).

       <b>commit</b>
           Install the specified commit of a git, mercurial, or fossil dependency (string).

       <b>tag</b>
           Install the specified tag of a git, mercurial, or fossil dependency (string).

       <b>bookmark</b>
           Install the specified bookmark of a mercurial dependency (string).
