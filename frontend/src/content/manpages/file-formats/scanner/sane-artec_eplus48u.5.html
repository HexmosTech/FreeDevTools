</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-artec_eplus48u - SANE backend for the scanner Artec E+ 48U and re-badged models

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-artec_eplus48u</b> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access
       to several USB flatbed scanners using the GT6816 chipset like the Artec E+ 48U.  These  scanners  have  a
       contact image sensor (CIS).

       A       complete       list       of       supported       devices       can       be       found      on
       <u><a href="http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html">http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html</a></u>.

       This is ALPHA software. Especially if you test new or untested scanners, keep your hand at the  scanner's
       plug and unplug it, if the head bumps at the end of the scan area.

       If  you  own a scanner other than the ones mentioned on the list that works with this backend, please let
       us know this by sending the scanner's exact model name and the USB vendor  and  product  ids  (e.g.  from
       <u>/proc/bus/usb/devices</u>, <b><a href="../man1/sane-find-scanner.1.html">sane-find-scanner</a></b>(1) or syslog) to me. Even if the scanner's name is only slightly
       different from the models mentioned above, please let me know.

</pre><h4><b>KERNEL</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       If  libusb-0.1.6  or  later  is  installed,  this  section can be skipped. The scanner should be found by
       <b><a href="../man1/sane-find-scanner.1.html">sane-find-scanner</a></b>(1) without further actions. For setting permissions and general USB information look at
       <b><a href="../man5/sane-usb.5.html">sane-usb</a></b>(5).

       When you are using the scanner module, a Linux kernel 2.4.12 or newer is required.

</pre><h4><b>FIRMWARE</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       You need a firmware file for your scanner. That's a small file containing software that will be  uploaded
       to  the  scanner's  memory. For the scanners mentioned above, it's usually named <u>Artec48.usb</u> or <u>1200.usb</u>.
       You can find it on the installation CD that was provided by the manufacturer, normally in  the  directory
       Win98, WinMe or similar.  If the Windows-driver is installed on your computer, then you can also find the
       firmware file under c:\windows\system32\drivers.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  contents  of  the  <u>artec_eplus48u.conf</u> file is a list of <u>usb</u> lines containing vendor and product ids
       that correspond to USB scanners. The file can also contain option lines.  Empty lines and lines  starting
       with  a  hash mark (#) are ignored.  The scanners are autodetected by <u>usb</u> <u>vendor_id</u> <u>product_id</u> statements
       which are already included into <u>artec_eplus48u.conf</u>  <u>.</u>   "vendor_id"  and  "product_id"  are  hexadecimal
       numbers that identify the scanner.

       Every <u>usb</u> section can have additional options.

       <b>artecFirmwareFile</b> <b>/usr/share/sane/artec_eplus48u/Artec48.usb</b>
              The path to the firmware file. This option is required.

       <b>redGamma</b> <b>1.0</b>

       <b>greenGamma</b> <b>1.0</b>

       <b>blueGamma</b> <b>1.0</b>

       <b>masterGamma</b> <b>1.9</b>
              These  are  the  default  gamma values. If you set the "Defaults" option with a frontend, then the
              gamma options are reset to the values specified here.

       <b>redOffset</b> <b>0x28</b>

       <b>greenOffset</b> <b>0x2f</b>

       <b>blueOffset</b> <b>0x2f</b>

       <b>redExposure</b> <b>0xa7</b>

       <b>greenExposure</b> <b>0x116</b>

       <b>blueExposure</b> <b>0xdc</b>
              These are the default values for offset and exposure time.  You can change them (e.g. to speed  up
              calibration) if you don't want to save the calibration data permanently.

       <b>vendorString</b> <b>Artec</b>

       <b>modelString</b> <b>E+</b> <b>48U</b>
              By  default,  the scanner is reported as "Artec E+ 48U". If you don't like this, e.g.  because you
              have an Tevion MD 9693, then change the options accordingly.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/usr/local/etc/sane.d/artec_eplus48u.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file (see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).

       <u>/usr/local/lib/sane/libsane-artec_eplus48u.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/local/lib/sane/libsane-artec_eplus48u.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.   On  *NIX  systems,  the  directories  are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are
              separated by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file is  searched
              in  two  default  directories: first, the current working directory (".") and then in <u>/etc/sane.d</u>.
              If the value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separator  character,  then  the
              default  directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories. For example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being
              searched (in this order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_ARTEC_EPLUS48U</b>
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug level for this backend.  Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_ARTEC_EPLUS48U=3

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       Michael Herder.
       This  backend  is  based  on  the gt68xx test-program written by Sergey Vlasov, Andreas Nowack, and David
       Stevenson. Thanks to everyone who tested the backend or reported bugs.
       This man page is based on man <b><a href="../man5/sane-gt68xx.5.html">sane-gt68xx</a></b>(5), written by Henning Meier-Geinitz.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This backend has been tested on Linux only. If you are using it on a different platform,  please  contact
       us.

       Interpolation with 1200 dpi is weak.

       Support for buttons is missing due to missing support in SANE.

       Please contact us if you find a bug: <u><a href="http://www.sane-project.org/bugs.html">http://www.sane-project.org/bugs.html</a></u>.
