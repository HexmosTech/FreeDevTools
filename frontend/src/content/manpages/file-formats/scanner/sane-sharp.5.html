</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-sharp - SANE backend for SHARP scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-sharp</b> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to Sharp
       SCSI scanners.  This backend should be considered <b>beta-quality</b> software!  In  the  current  state  it  is
       known  to work with JX-610 and JX-250 scanners. It is prepared for usage with the JX-330 series scanners,
       but we are not able to test it with these devices.

       For other Sharp scanners, it may or may not work.

       At present, the following scanners are known to work with this backend.

              Vendor  Product id:
              -----   -----------
              Sharp   JX-610
              Sharp   JX-250
              Sharp   JX-320
              Sharp   JX-330
              Sharp   JX-350

       The following scanners are detected by the backend, but not tested:

              Vendor  Product id:
              -----   -----------
              Sharp   JX-325

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              <u>special</u>

       where <u>special</u> is the path-name for the special device that corresponds to a  SCSI  scanner.  The  special
       device name must be a generic SCSI device or a symlink to such a device.  Under Linux, such a device name
       could be <u>/dev/sga</u> or <u>/dev/sge</u>, for example.  See <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5) for details.

</pre><h4><b>SCAN</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--mode</b> Scan  Mode.  Possible  settings  are:  <u>Lineart</u> (1 bit black &amp; white scans), <u>Gray</u> (8 bit gray scale
              scans), <u>Lineart</u> <u>Color</u> (bi-level color scans), and <u>Color</u> (8 bit RGB scans). The  default  value  is
              <u>Color.</u>

       <b>--halftone-pattern</b>
              Halftone  Pattern. Available only for the JX-330 series scanners.  Possible settings: <u>none</u>, <u>Dither</u>
              <u>Bayer</u>, <u>Dither</u> <u>Spiral</u>, <u>Dither</u> <u>Dispersed</u> and <u>Error</u> <u>Diffusion</u>.  The default value is <u>none</u>.

       <b>--source</b>
              Paper Source. This option is only available if an automatic  document  feeder  or  a  transparency
              adapter  is installed. Possible settings are: <u>Flatbed</u>, <u>Automatic</u> <u>Document</u> <u>Feeder</u>, and <u>Transparency</u>
              <u>Adapter</u>.  If an ADF or a transparency adapter is installed, using it is the default selection.

       <b>--custom-gamma</b>
              Custom Gamma. This option determines whether a builtin or a custom gamma table is  used.  Possible
              settings are: <u>yes</u> (enables custom gamma tables) or <u>no</u> (enables a built gamma table).

       <b>--gamma</b>
              Gamma.  This  option  is only available if <b>Custom</b> <b>Gamma</b> is set to <u>no</u>.  Possible values are: <u>1.0</u> or
              <u>2.2</u>.  The default value is <u>2.2</u>.  (The JX-250 and JX-350 have no built  in  gamma  correction;  for
              these scanners, a gamma table is downloaded to the scanner by the backend.)

       <b>--gamma-table</b>
              Gamma Table. Allowed values: 0..255; 256 numbers must be defined.  The default values are 0, 1, 2,
              .. 255 (i.e., gamma == 1). This table is only used for gray scale scans.

       <b>--red-gamma-table</b>
              Red  Gamma  Table. Allowed values: 0..255; 256 numbers must be defined.  The default values are 0,
              1, 2, .. 255 (i.e., gamma == 1).

       <b>--green-gamma-table</b>
              Green Gamma Table. Allowed values: 0..255; 256 numbers must be defined.  The default values are 0,
              1, 2, .. 255 (i.e., gamma == 1).

       <b>--blue-gamma-table</b>
              Blue Gamma Table. Allowed values: 0..255; 256 numbers must be defined.  The default values are  0,
              1, 2, .. 255 (i.e., gamma == 1).

       <b>--resolution</b>
              Selects  the  resolution of the scanned image. Allowed values: <u>30..600</u> (JX-330, JX-350 and JX-610)
              and <u>30..400</u> (JX-250).  The default value is 150.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>-t</b>, <b>-x</b>, <b>-y</b>
              Scan Window.  Top-left x position of scan area (<b>-l</b>), top-left y position of scan area (<b>-t</b>), bottom
              right x position of scan area (<b>-x</b>) and bottom right y position of scan area  (<b>-y</b>).   The  possible
              settings  depend on the scanner model and, for the JX-250 and the JX-350, also on the usage of the
              automatic document feeder resp. the transparency adapter. Please refer to the  values  allowed  by
              <b><a href="../man1/xscanimage.1.html">xscanimage</a></b>(1),  or  <b><a href="../man1/xsane.1.html">xsane</a></b>(1).   With <b><a href="../man1/scanimage.1.html">scanimage</a></b>(1), enter one of the following commands in order to
              see the allowed parameter values for the scan window:

              scanimage -d sharp --source "Automatic Document Feeder" --help

              scanimage -d sharp --source Flatbed --help

              scanimage -d sharp --source "Transparency Adapter" --help

</pre><h4><b>ADF</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       If a paper jam occurrs, the maintenance cover <u>must</u> be opened and closed, even if the jammed paper can  be
       removed without opening the maintenance cover. Otherwise, the error condition will not be cleared.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  contents  of  the  <u>sharp.conf</u>  file  is  a list of options and device names that correspond to Sharp
       scanners. Empty lines and lines beginning with a hash mark (#) are ignored. See <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5) for  details
       about device names.

       Lines  setting  an  option start with the key word <b>option,</b> followed by the option's name and the option's
       value. At present, three options are defined: <b>buffers,</b> <b>buffersize,</b> and <b>readqueue.</b>

       Options defined at the start of <u>sharp.conf</u> apply to all devices; options  defined  after  a  device  name
       apply to this device.

       The  options <b>buffers</b> and <b>readqueue</b> are only significant if the backend has been compiled so that for each
       scan a second process is forked (switch <b>USE_FORK</b> in <u>sharp.c</u> ). This process reads the scan data from  the
       scanner  and writes this data into a block of shared memory.  The parent process reads the data from this
       memory block and delivers it to the frontend. The options control the  size  and  usage  of  this  shared
       memory block.

       <b>option</b> <b>buffers</b> defines the number of buffers used. The smallest number allowed is 2.

       <b>option</b>  <b>buffersize</b> defines the size of one buffer. Since each buffer is filled with a single read command
       sent to the scanner, its size is limited automatically to the size allowed by the operating system or  by
       the  Sane  SCSI library for SCSI read commands. A buffer size of 128 kB or 256 kB is recommended for scan
       resolutions of 300 dpi and above.

       <b>option</b> <b>readqueue</b> defines how many read commands to be sent to the scanner are  queued.  At  present,  the
       Sane  SCSI  library supports queued read commands only for for Linux. For other operating systems, <b>option</b>
       <b>readqueue</b> should be set to 0. For Linux, <b>option</b> <b>readqueue</b> should be set to 2. Larger values  than  2  for
       <b>option</b>  <b>readqueue</b>  are  not  reasonable  in  most  cases.   <b>option</b>  <b>buffers</b> should be greater than <b>option</b>
       <b>readqueue.</b>

</pre><h4><b>Performance</b> <b>Considerations</b></h4><pre>
       This section focuses on the problem of stops of the scanner's carriage  during  a  scan.  Carriage  stops
       happen  mainly  with  the JX-250. This scanner has obviously only a small internal buffer compared to its
       speed. That means that the backend must read the data as fast as possible from the scanner  in  order  to
       avoid carriage stops.

       Even the JX-250 needs only less than 10 seconds for a 400 dpi A4 gray scale scan, which results in a data
       transfer  rate  of  more than 1.6 MB per second. This means that the data produced by the scanner must be
       processed fairly fast. Due to the small internal buffer of the JX-250, the  backend  must  issue  a  read
       request  for  the  next  data  block  as soon as possible after reading a block of data in order to avoid
       carriage stops.

       Stops of the carriage can be caused by the following reasons:

              - too much "traffic" on the SCSI bus,
              - slow responses by the backend to the scanner,
              - a program which processes the data acquired by the backend is too slow.

       Too much "traffic" on the SCSI bus: This happens for example, if hard disks are  connected  to  the  same
       SCSI  bus as the scanner, and when data transfer from/to these hard disks requires a considerable part of
       the SCSI bandwidth during a scan. If this is the case, you should consider to connect the  scanner  to  a
       separate SCSI adapter.

       Slow  responses  by the backend to the scanner: Unfortunately, UNIX-like operating systems generally have
       no real time capabilities.  Thus there is no guarantee that the backend is under any  circumstances  able
       to  communicate  with  the  scanner  as fast as required. To minimize this problem, the backend should be
       compiled so that a separate reader process is forked: Make sure that <b>USE_FORK</b> is defined when you compile
       <u>sharp.c.</u>  If slow responses of the backend remain to be problem, you could try to reduce the load of  the
       system.  Even  while the backend and the reader process need only a minor amount of processor time, other
       running processes can cause an increase in the time delay between two time slices  given  to  the  reader
       process.  On  slower  systems,  such  an  increased delay can be enough to cause a carriage stop with the
       JX-250.  For Linux, the usage of the SG driver  version  2.1.36  or  above  is  recommended,  because  it
       supports, in combination with the SCSI library of Sane version 1.0.2, command queueing within the kernel.
       This  queueing implementation, combined with a buffer size of at least 128 kB, should avoid most carriage
       stops.

       Slow processing of the scan data: An example for this situation is the access to the  scanner  via  a  10
       MBit Ethernet, which is definitely too slow to transfer the scan data as fast as they are produced by the
       scanner.  If  you  have enough memory available, you can increase <b>option</b> <b>buffers,</b> so that an entire image
       can be stored in these buffers.

       In order to see, if the backend is too slow or if the further processing of the data is too slow, set the
       environment variable <b>SANE_DEBUG_SHARP</b> to 1. When a scan is finished, the backend writes the line  "buffer
       full  conditions:  <u>nn</u>"  to  stderr. If <u>nn</u> is zero, carriage stops are caused by too slow responses of the
       backend or too much "traffic" on the SCSI bus. If <u>nn</u> is greater than zero, the backend  had  to  wait  <u>nn</u>
       times until a buffer has been processed by the frontend. (Please note that <b>option</b> <b>buffers</b> must be greater
       than <b>option</b> <b>readqueue</b> in order to get useful output for "buffer full conditions".)

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/sharp.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-sharp.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-sharp.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_DEBUG_SHARP</b>
              If  the  library  was  compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128 requests  all  debug  output  to  be  printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>PROBLEMS</b></h4><pre>
       1. ADF Mode
              After  several ADF scans, the scanner moves the carriage back to the idle position and back to ADF
              scan position, before a scan starts. We do not know, if this is a problem of the  scanner,  or  if
              this  is a bug of the backend. At present, the scanner must power off and on to stop this annoying
              behaviour.

       2. Threshold level does not work (only JX-610)

       3. The maximum resolution is limited to 600 dpi (JX-610 supported to 1200 dpi) resp. 400 dpi (JX-250)

       4. If the JX-250 is used with an ADF, the following situation can occur: After several scans, the scanner
       moves, after loading a new sheet of paper, the carriage to the  idle  position,  and  then  back  to  the
       position  used  for ADF scans. This happens for <u>every</u> scan, in contrast to the calibration, which is done
       after 10 scans. (For the calibration, the carriage is also moved to the idle position.) We do not know if
       this behavior is caused by the backend, or if it is a bug in the firmware of the scanner.

       5. Usage of a transparency adapter (film scan unit) is supported, but not tested.
