       sane-bh - SANE backend for Bell+Howell Copiscan II series document scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-bh</b>  library  implements  a  SANE  (Scanner  Access  Now  Easy)  backend that provides access to
       Bell+Howell Copiscan II series document scanners.  The Copiscan II 6338  has  been  the  primary  scanner
       model  used  during development and testing, but since the programming interface for the entire series is
       consistent the backend should work for the following scanner models:

              COPISCAN II 6338 Duplex Scanner with ACE
              COPISCAN II 2135 Simplex Scanner
              COPISCAN II 2137(A) Simplex Scanner (with ACE)
              COPISCAN II 2138A Simplex Scanner with ACE
              COPISCAN II 3238 Simplex Scanner
              COPISCAN II 3338(A) Simplex Scanner (with ACE)

       If you have  a  Bell+Howell  scanner  and  are  able  to  test  it  with  this  backend,  please  contact
       <u><a href="mailto:sane-devel@alioth-lists.debian.net">sane-devel@alioth-lists.debian.net</a></u>   with   the  model  number  and  testing  results.  Have  a  look  at
       <u><a href="http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html">http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html</a></u> concerning subscription to sane-devel.  Additionally,  the
       author  is  curious  as  to  the  likelihood  of  using  this backend with the newer 4000 and 8000 series
       scanners.  If you have such a beast, please let me know.

       The Bell+Howell Copiscan II series document scanners are high volume, high throughput  scanners  designed
       for  document  scanning  applications.   As  such, they are lineart/grayscale scanners supporting a fixed
       number of fairly low resolutions (e.g. 200/240/300dpi).  However, they do have a  number  of  interesting
       and  useful  features suited to needs of document imaging applications.  This backend attempts to support
       as many of these features as possible.

       The main technical reference used in writing this backend is the <b>Bell</b> <b>and</b> <b>Howell</b> <b>Copiscan</b> <b>II</b> <b>Remote</b>  <b>SCSI</b>
       <b>Controller</b>  <b>(RSC)</b>  <b>OEM</b>  <b>Technical</b>  <b>Manual</b>  <b>Version</b>  <b>1.5.</b>   The Linux SCSI programming HOWTO, the SANE API
       documentation, and SANE source code were also extremely valuable resources.

       The latest backend release, additional information and helpful  hints  are  available  from  the  backend
       homepage:
              <u><a href="http://www.martoneconsulting.com/sane-bh.html">http://www.martoneconsulting.com/sane-bh.html</a></u>

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              <u>special</u>

       Where  <u>special</u>  is  the  path-name  for  the  special device that corresponds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI
       scanners, the special device name must be a generic SCSI device or a symlink to  such  a  device.   Under
       Linux, such a device name takes a format such as <u>/dev/sga</u> or <u>/dev/sg0</u>, for example.  See <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5) for
       details.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Scan</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>Options:</b>

       <b>--preview[=(yes|no)]</b> <b>[no]</b>
              Request  a preview-quality scan.  When preview is set to yes image compression is disabled and the
              image is delivered in a <b>SANE_FRAME_GRAY</b> frame.

       <b>--mode</b> <b>lineart|halftone</b> <b>[lineart]</b>
              Selects the scan mode (e.g., lineart, monochrome, or color).

       <b>--resolution</b> <b>200|240|300dpi</b> <b>[200]</b>
              Sets the resolution of the scanned  image.   Each  scanner  model  supports  a  list  of  standard
              resolutions; only these resolutions can be used.

       <b>--compression</b> <b>none|g31d|g32d|g42d</b> <b>[none]</b>
              Sets  the compression mode of the scanner.  Determines the type of data returned from the scanner.
              Values are:

              <b>none</b> - uncompressed data - delivered in a SANE_FRAME_GRAY frame
              <b>g31d</b> - CCITT G3 1 dimension (MH) - delivered in a SANE_FRAME_G31D frame
              <b>g32d</b> - CCITT G3 2 dimensions (MR, K=4) - delivered in a SANE_FRAME_G32D frame
              <b>g42d</b> - CCITT G4 (MMR) - delivered in a SANE_FRAME_G42D frame

              <b>NOTE</b>: The use of g31d, g32d, and g42d compression values causes the backend to  generate  optional
              frame formats which may not be supported by all SANE frontends.

       <b>Geometry</b> <b>Options:</b>

       <b>--autoborder[=(yes|no)]</b> <b>[yes]</b>
              Enable/Disable automatic image border detection.  When enabled, the RSC unit automatically detects
              the image area and sets the window geometry to match.

       <b>--paper-size</b> <b>Custom|Letter|Legal|A3|A4|A5|A6|B4|B5</b> <b>[Custom]</b>
              Specify the scan window geometry by specifying the paper size of the documents to be scanned.

       <b>--tl-x</b> <b>0..297.18mm</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Top-left x position of scan area.

       <b>--tl-y</b> <b>0..431.8mm</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Top-left y position of scan area.

       <b>--br-x</b> <b>0..297.18mm</b> <b>[297.18]</b>
              Bottom-right x position of scan area.

       <b>--br-y</b> <b>0..431.8mm</b> <b>[431.8]</b>
              Bottom-right y position of scan area.

       <b>Feeder</b> <b>Options:</b>

       <b>--source</b> <b>Automatic</b> <b>Document</b> <b>Feeder|Manual</b> <b>Feed</b> <b>Tray</b> <b>[Automatic</b> <b>Document</b> <b>Feeder]</b>
              Selects  the  scan  source (such as a document feeder).  This option is provided to allow multiple
              image scans with <b><a href="../man1/xsane.1.html">xsane</a></b>(1); it has no other purpose.

       <b>--batch[=(yes|no)]</b> <b>[no]</b>
              Enable/disable batch mode scanning.  Batch mode allows scanning at maximum throughput by buffering
              within the RSC unit.  This option is recommended when performing multiple pages  scans  until  the
              feeder is emptied.

       <b>--duplex[=(yes|no)]</b> <b>[no]</b>
              Enable  duplex  (dual-sided)  scanning.   The  scanner takes an image of each side of the document
              during a single pass through the scanner.  The front page is delivered followed by the back  page.
              Most options, such as compression, affect both the front and back pages.

       <b>--timeout-adf</b> <b>0..255</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Sets  the  timeout  in seconds for the automatic document feeder (ADF).  The value 0 specifies the
              hardware default value which varies based on the scanner model.

       <b>--timeout-manual</b> <b>0..255</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Sets the timeout in seconds for semi-automatic feeder.  The value 0 specifies the hardware default
              value which varies based on the scanner model.

       <b>--check-adf[=(yes|no)]</b> <b>[no]</b>
              Check ADF status prior to starting scan using the OBJECT POSITION command.  Note that this feature
              requires RSC firmware level 1.5 or higher and dip switch 4 must be in the on position.  NOTE: This
              option has not been tested extensively and may produce undesirable results.

       <b>Enhancement:</b>

       <b>--control-panel[=(yes|no)]</b> <b>[yes]</b>
              Enables the scanner's control panel for selecting image enhancement parameters.  When  the  option
              is  set  to  no  the following options are used to control image enhancement.  See the Bell+Howell
              scanner users' guide for complete information on ACE functionality.

       <b>--ace-function</b> <b>-4..4</b> <b>[3]</b>
              Specify the Automatic Contrast Enhancement (ACE) Function.

       <b>--ace-sensitivity</b> <b>0..9</b> <b>[5]</b>
              Specify the Automatic Contrast Enhancement (ACE) Sensitivity.

       <b>--brightness</b> <b>0..255</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Controls the brightness of the acquired image.  Ignored for ACE capable scanners.

       <b>--threshold</b> <b>0..255</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Select minimum-brightness to get a white point.  Ignored for ACE capable scanners.

       <b>--contrast</b> <b>0..255</b> <b>[inactive]</b>
              Controls the contrast of the acquired image.  This option is not currently  used  by  the  scanner
              (and perhaps never will be).

       <b>--negative[=(yes|no)]</b> <b>[no]</b>
              Swap black and white, yielding a reverse-video image.

       <b>Icon:</b>

       <b>--icon-width</b> <b>0..3600pel</b> <b>(in</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>8)</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Width of icon (thumbnail) image in pixels.

       <b>--icon-length</b> <b>0..3600pel</b> <b>(in</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>8)</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Length of icon (thumbnail) image in pixels.

       <b>Barcode</b> <b>Options:</b>

       <b>--barcode-search-bar</b> <b>&lt;see</b> <b>list&gt;</b> <b>[none]</b>
              Specifies  the  barcode  type to search for.  If this option is not specified, or specified with a
              value of none, then the barcode decoding feature is completely disabled.  The valid  barcode  type
              are:

              <b>none</b>
              <b>ean-8</b>
              <b>ean-13</b>
              <b>reserved-ean-add</b>
              <b>code39</b>
              <b>code2-5-interleaved</b>
              <b>code2-5-3lines-matrix</b>
              <b>code2-5-3lines-datalogic</b>
              <b>code2-5-5lines-industrial</b>
              <b>patchcode</b>
              <b>codabar</b>
              <b>codabar-with-start-stop</b>
              <b>code39ascii</b>
              <b>code128</b>
              <b>code2-5-5lines-iata</b>

       <b>--barcode-search-count</b> <b>1..7</b> <b>[3]</b>
              Number  of  times  that  the  RSC  performs  the  decoding algorithm.  Specify the smallest number
              possible to increase performance.  If you are having trouble recognizing barcodes, it is suggested
              that you increase this option to its maximum value (7).

       <b>--barcode-search-mode</b> <b>&lt;see</b> <b>list&gt;</b> <b>[horiz-vert]</b>
              Chooses the orientation of barcodes to be searched.  The valid orientations are:

              <b>horiz-vert</b>
              <b>horizontal</b>
              <b>vertical</b>
              <b>vert-horiz</b>

       <b>--barcode-hmin</b> <b>0..1660mm</b> <b>[5]</b>
              Sets the barcode minimum height in millimeters (larger values  increase  recognition  speed).   Of
              course the actual barcodes in the document must be of sufficient size.

       <b>--barcode-search-timeout</b> <b>20..65535us</b> <b>[10000]</b>
              Sets  the  timeout  for  barcode searching in milliseconds.  When the timeout expires, the decoder
              will stop trying to decode barcodes.

       <b>--section</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> <b>[]</b>
              Specifies a series of image sections.  A section can be used  to  gather  a  subset  image  or  to
              provide  a  small  area  for  barcode decoding.  Each section is specified in the following format
              (units are in millimeters):

       <b>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;+&lt;top-left-x&gt;+&lt;top-left-y&gt;[:functioncode...]</b>

       Multiple sections can be specified by separating them with commas.

       For example <b>76.2x25.4+50.8+0:frontbar</b> identifies an area 3 inches wide and 1 inch high with  a  top  left
       corner  at the top of the page two inches from the left hand edge of the page.  This section will be used
       for barcode decoding on the front page only.

       For example <b>50.8x25.4+25.4+0:frontbar:front:g42d</b> identifies an area 2 inches wide and 1 inch high with  a
       top  left  corner at the top of the page one inch from the left hand edge of the page.  This section will
       be used for barcode decoding on the front page as well as generating an image compressed in g42d format.

       Ordinarily barcodes are searched in the entire image.  However, when you  specify  sections  all  barcode
       searching  is done within the specific sections identified.  This can significantly speed up the decoding
       process.

       The following function codes are available:

              <b>front</b> - generate an image for the front page section
              <b>back</b> - generate an image for the back page section
              <b>frontbar</b> - perform barcode search in front page section
              <b>backbar</b> - perform barcode search in back page section
              <b>frontpatch</b> - perform patchcode search in front page section
              <b>backpatch</b> - perform patchcode search in back page section
              <b>none</b> - use no image compression
              <b>g31d</b> - use Group 3 1 dimension image compression
              <b>g32d</b> - use Group 3 2 dimensions image compression
              <b>g42d</b> - use Group 4 2 dimensions image compression

       If you omit a compression functioncode, the full page  compression  setting  is  used.   If  you  specify
       multiple compression functioncodes, only the last one is used.

       <b>--barcode-relmax</b> <b>0..255</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Specifies the maximum relation from the widest to the smallest bar.

       <b>--barcode-barmin</b> <b>0..255</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Specifies the minimum number of bars in Bar/Patch code.

       <b>--barcode-barmax</b> <b>0..255</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Specifies the maximum number of bars in a Bar/Patch code.

       <b>--barcode-contrast</b> <b>0..6</b> <b>[3]</b>
              Specifies the image contrast used in decoding.  Use higher values when there are more white pixels
              in the code.

       <b>--barcode-patchmode</b> <b>0..1</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Controls Patch Code detection.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  contents of the <u>bh.conf</u> file is a list of device names that correspond to Bell+Howell scanners.  See
       <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5) on details of what constitutes a valid device name.  Additionally, options can be specified;
       these lines begin with the word "option".  Each option is described in detail  below.   Empty  lines  and
       lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options can be specified in the <u>bh.conf</u> file:

       <b>disable-optional-frames</b>
              This option prevents the backend from sending any optional frames.  This option may be useful when
              dealing with frontends which do not support these optional frames.  When this option is in effect,
              the  data  is  sent  in  a  <b>SANE_FRAME_GRAY</b>  frame.  The optional frames sent by this backend are:
              <b>SANE_FRAME_G31D</b>, <b>SANE_FRAME_G32D</b>, <b>SANE_FRAME_G42D</b> and <b>SANE_FRAME_TEXT</b>.  These frames are generated
              based on the compression and barcode options.  These frames are never sent in preview mode.

       <b>fake-inquiry</b>
              This option is used for debugging purposes and its use is not encouraged.  Essentially, it  allows
              the  backend  to  initialize  in the absence of a scanner.  This is useful for development and not
              much else.  This option must be specified earlier in the configuration file than the devices which
              are to be "faked".

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/bh.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file (see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-bh.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-bh.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.  On  *NIX  systems,  the  directories  are  separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are
              separated by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file is  searched
              in  two  default  directories: first, the current working directory (".") and then in <u>/etc/sane.d</u>.
              If the value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separator  character,  then  the
              default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being
              searched (in this order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_BH</b>
              If  the  library  was  compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 255 requests  all  debug  output  to  be  printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ADF</b> <b>support</b>
              With  document  scanners,  automatic  document feeder (ADF) support is a key feature.  The backend
              supports the ADF by default and returns <b>SANE_STATUS_NO_DOCS</b> when  the  out-of-paper  condition  is
              detected.  The SANE frontend <b><a href="../man1/scanadf.1.html">scanadf</a></b>(1) is a command line frontend that supports multi-page scans.
              It  has  been  used successfully with this backend.  The SANE frontend <b><a href="../man1/xsane.1.html">xsane</a></b>(1) is an improved GUI
              frontend by Oliver Rauch.  Support for multi-page scans is included  in  xsane  version  0.35  and
              above.

       <b>Duplex</b> <b>scanning</b>
              Some models, such as the COPISCAN II 6338, support duplex scanning.  That is, they scan both sides
              of  the  document  during  a  single pass through the scanner (the scanner has two cameras).  This
              backend supports duplex scanning (with the <b>--duplex</b> option).  The front and back page  images  are
              delivered consecutively as if they were separately scanned pages.

       <b>Hardware</b> <b>compression</b>
              The  scanner  is capable of compressing the data into several industry standard formats (CCITT G3,
              CCITT G3-2D, CCITT G4).  This results in increased performance as less data  is  passed  from  the
              scanner  to  the  host  over the SCSI bus.  The backend supports these compression formats via the
              <b>--g31d,</b> <b>--g32d,</b> <b>--g42d</b> options, respectively.  Many SANE frontends are not equipped to  deal  with
              these  formats, however.  The SANE frontend <b><a href="../man1/scanadf.1.html">scanadf</a></b>(1) supports these optional frame formats.  The
              compressed image data is written directly to a file and can then be  processed  by  a  scan-script
              using the <b>--scan-script</b> option.  Examples of this are given on the <b><a href="../man1/scanadf.1.html">scanadf</a></b>(1) homepage.

       <b>Automatic</b> <b>Border</b> <b>Detection</b>
              The  scanner  can  automatically  detect  the  paper  size and adjust the scanning window geometry
              appropriately.  The backend supports this useful feature with  the  <b>--autoborder</b>  option.   It  is
              enabled by default.

       <b>Batch</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>Scanning</b>
              The batch scan mode allows for maximum throughput.  The Set Window parameters must remain constant
              during the entire batch.

       <b>Icon</b> <b>Generation</b>
              The  Icon  function generates a thumbnail of the full page image, that can be transferred as if it
              were a separate page.  This allows the host to quickly display a thumbnail  representation  during
              the  scanning  operation.   Perhaps  this would be a great way of implementing a preview scan, but
              since a normal scan is so quick, it might not be worth the trouble.

       <b>Multiple</b> <b>Sections</b>
              Multiple sections (scanning sub-windows) can be defined  for  the  front  and  back  pages.   Each
              section  can  have  different  characteristics  (e.g.  geometry,  compression).   The sections are
              returned as if they were separately scanned images.  Additionally sections can be used to  greatly
              enhance  the  accuracy  and  efficiency  of the barcode/patchcode decoding process by limiting the
              search area to a small subset of the page.  Most Copiscan II series scanners support up to 8 user-
              defined sections.

       <b>Support</b> <b>Barcode/Patchcode</b> <b>Decoding</b>
              The RSC unit can recognize Bar and Patch Codes of various types embedded  in  the  scanned  image.
              The  codes  are  decoded  and  the  data is returned to the frontend as a text frame.  The text is
              encoded in xml and contains a great deal of  information  about  the  decoded  data  such  as  the
              location  where  it was found, its orientation, and the time it took to find.  Further information
              on the content of this text frame as well as some barcode decoding examples can be  found  on  the
              backend homepage.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Decoding</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>barcode</b> <b>type</b> <b>per</b> <b>scan</b>
              The RSC unit can search for up to six different barcode types at a time.  While the code generally
              supports  this  as  well, the <b>--barcode-search-bar</b> option only allows the user to specify a single
              barcode type.  Perhaps another option which allows a comma separated list of  barcode  type  codes
              could be added to address this.

       <b>Scanning</b> <b>a</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> <b>in</b> <b>batch</b> <b>mode</b>
              The  separation  of  front and back end functionality in SANE presents a problem in supporting the
              'cancel batch' functionality in the scanner.  In batch mode, the scanner is always a page ahead of
              the host.  The host, knowing ahead of time which page will be the  last,  can  cancel  batch  mode
              prior  to  initiating  the  last scan command.  Currently, there is no mechanism available for the
              frontend to pass this knowledge to the backend.  If batch mode  is  enabled  and  the  <b>--end-count</b>
              terminates  a <b><a href="../man1/scanadf.1.html">scanadf</a></b>(1) session, an extra page will be pulled through the scanner, but is neither
              read nor delivered to the frontend.  The issue  can  be  avoided  by  specifying  <b>--batch=no</b>  when
              scanning a fixed number of pages.

       <b>Revision</b> <b>1.2</b> <b>Patch</b> <b>detector</b>
              There  is  an  enhanced  patchcode  detection  algorithm available in the RSC with revision 1.2 or
              higher that is faster and more reliable than the standard Bar/Patch code  decoder.   This  is  not
              currently supported.
