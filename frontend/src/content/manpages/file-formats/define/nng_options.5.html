</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This page documents the various standard options that can be set or retrieved on objects.

       Sockets (nng_socket objects) use the functions nng_socket_get() and nng_socket_set() to set and retrieve
       option values.

       Dialers (nng_dialer objects) use the functions nng_dialer_get() and nng_dialer_set() to set and retrieve
       option values.

       Listeners (nng_listener objects) use the functions nng_listener_get() and nng_listener_set() to set and
       retrieve option values.

       Pipes (nng_pipe objects) can only retrieve option values using the nng_pipe_get() function.

       Other object types may have additional methods to access these options.

       In addition to the options listed here, transports and protocols will generally have some of their own
       options, which will be documented with the transport or protocol.

   <b>Generic</b> <b>Options</b>
       In the following list of options, the name of the option is supplied, along with the data type of the
       underlying value.

       Some options are only meaningful or supported in certain contexts; for example there is no single
       meaningful address for a socket, since sockets can have multiple dialers and endpoints associated with
       them. An attempt has been made to include details about such restrictions in the description of the
       option.

       NNG_OPT_LOCADDR
           (nng_sockaddr) This read-only option may be used on listeners, dialers and connected pipes, and
           represents the local address used for communication. NOTE: Not all transports support this option,
           and some transports may support it on listeners but not dialers.

           When used on a TCP dialer, this option is used to configure the source IP address that will be used
           when initiating outgoing connections. The specific port number will be ignored, however, and the
           system will choose a random ephemeral port instead.

       NNG_OPT_RAW

           (bool) This read-only option indicates whether the socket is in raw mode. If true, the socket is in
           raw mode, and if false the socket is in normal mode.

           Raw mode sockets generally do not have any protocol-specific semantics applied to them; instead the
           application is expected to perform such semantics itself. (For example, in normal mode a <u>rep</u> socket
           would automatically copy message headers from a received message to the corresponding reply, whereas
           in raw mode this is not done.) See Raw Mode for more details.

           <b>Note</b>

           This option is deprecated. Use the nng_socket_raw function instead.

       NNG_OPT_RECONNMINT

           (nng_duration) This is the minimum amount of time (milliseconds) to wait before attempting to
           establish a connection after a previous attempt has failed. This can be set on a socket, but it can
           also be overridden on an individual dialer. The option is irrelevant for listeners.

       NNG_OPT_RECONNMAXT

           (nng_duration) This is the maximum amount of time (milliseconds) to wait before attempting to
           establish a connection after a previous attempt has failed. If this is non-zero, then the time
           between successive connection attempts will start at the value of NNG_OPT_RECONNMINT, and grow
           exponentially, until it reaches this value. If this value is zero, then no exponential back-off
           between connection attempts is done, and each attempt will wait the time specified by
           NNG_OPT_RECONNMINT. This can be set on a socket, but it can also be overridden on an individual
           dialer. The option is irrelevant for listeners.

       NNG_OPT_RECVBUF

           (int) This is the depth of the socket’s receive buffer as a number of messages. Messages received by
           a transport may be buffered until the application has accepted them for delivery. This value must be
           an integer between 0 and 8192, inclusive. NOTE: Not all protocols support buffering received
           messages. For example <u>req</u> can only deal with a single reply at a time.

       NNG_OPT_RECVFD

           (int) This read-only option is used to obtain an integer file descriptor suitable for use with poll()
           &lt;<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/poll.html">http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/poll.html</a>&gt;, select()
           &lt;<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/select.html">http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/select.html</a>&gt;, (or on Windows systems WSAPoll()
           &lt;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms741669(v=vs.85).aspx&gt;) and similar
           functions. This descriptor will be <b>readable</b> when a message is available for receiving on the socket.
           When no message is ready for receiving, then this file descriptor will <b>not</b> be readable.

               <b>Important</b>

               Applications should never attempt to read or write to the returned file descriptor.

               <b>Important</b>

               This option is incompatible with nng_ctx contexts and should not be used on a socket where they
               are in use.

               <b>Tip</b>

               While this option may help applications integrate into existing polling loops, it is more
               efficient, and often easier, to use the asynchronous I/O objects instead. See nng_aio_alloc().

       NNG_OPT_RECVMAXSZ

           (size_t) This is the maximum message size that the will be accepted from a remote peer. If a peer
           attempts to send a message larger than this, then the message will be discarded. If the value of this
           is zero, then no limit on message sizes is enforced. This option exists to prevent certain kinds of
           denial-of-service attacks, where a malicious agent can claim to want to send an extraordinarily large
           message, without sending any data. This option can be set for the socket, but may be overridden for
           on a per-dialer or per-listener basis.

               <b>Important</b>

               Applications on hostile networks should set this to a non-zero value to prevent denial-of-service
               attacks.

               <b>Important</b>

               This option should be set before any listeners or dialers are added. Ideally this option should
               be set on specific dialers or listeners; setting it on the socket globally is deprecated
               behavior, and might not work in a future release, or might only work for endpoints that have not
               yet been created. (Maximum receive sizes might be negotiated during connection establishment for
               future transports, which means that the option needs to be set before any connections are
               established.)

               <b>Note</b>

               Some transports may have further message size restrictions.

       NNG_OPT_RECVTIMEO

           (nng_duration) This is the socket receive timeout in milliseconds. When no message is available for
           receiving at the socket for this period of time, receive operations will fail with a return value of
           NNG_ETIMEDOUT.

       NNG_OPT_REMADDR
           (nng_sockaddr) This read-only option may be used on dialers and connected pipes, and represents the
           address of a remote peer. Not all transports support this option.

       NNG_OPT_SENDBUF

           (int) This is the depth of the socket send buffer as a number of messages. Messages sent by an
           application may be buffered by the socket until a transport is ready to accept them for delivery.
           This value must be an integer between 0 and 8192, inclusive.

               <b>Note</b>

               Not all protocols support buffering sent messages. For example, <u>req</u> can only have a single
               request outstanding at a time (per context).

       NNG_OPT_SENDFD

           (int) This read-only option is used to obtain an integer file descriptor suitable for use with poll()
           &lt;<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/poll.html">http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/poll.html</a>&gt;, select()
           &lt;<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/select.html">http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/select.html</a>&gt;, (or on Windows systems WSAPoll()
           &lt;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms741669(v=vs.85).aspx&gt;) and similar
           functions.

           This descriptor will be <b>readable</b> when the socket is able to accept a message for sending without
           blocking. When the socket is no longer able to accept such messages without blocking, the descriptor
           will <b>not</b> be readable.

               <b>Important</b>

               Applications should never attempt to read or write to the returned file descriptor; use should be
               limited to polling system calls only.

               <b>Important</b>

               This option is incompatible with nng_ctx contexts and should not be used on a socket where they
               are in use.

               <b>Tip</b>

               While this option may help applications integrate into existing polling loops, it is more
               efficient, and often easier, to use the asynchronous I/O objects instead. See nng_aio_alloc().

       NNG_OPT_SENDTIMEO

           (nng_duration) This is the socket send timeout in milliseconds. When a message cannot be queued for
           delivery by the socket for this period of time (such as if send buffers are full), the operation will
           fail with a return value of NNG_ETIMEDOUT.

       NNG_OPT_SOCKNAME

           (string) This the socket name. By default, this is a string corresponding to the value of the socket.
           The string must fit within 64-bytes, including the terminating NUL byte. The value is intended for
           application use, and is not used for anything in the library itself.

       NNG_OPT_MAXTTL
           (int)

           This is the maximum number of times a message may traverse across a nng_device() forwarders. The
           intention here is to prevent forwarding loops in device chains. When this is supported, it can have a
           value between 1 and 255, inclusive.

               <b>Note</b>

               Not all protocols support this option. Those that do generally have a default value of 8.

               <b>Tip</b>

               Each node along a forwarding path may have its own value for the maximum time-to-live, and
               performs its own checks before forwarding a message. Therefore it is helpful if all nodes in the
               topology use the same value for this option.

       NNG_OPT_URL

           (string) This read-only option is used to obtain the URL with which a listener or dialer was
           configured. Accordingly it can only be used with dialers, listeners, and pipes.

               <b>Note</b>

               Some transports will canonify URLs before returning them to the application.

       NNG_OPT_PROTO
           (int) This read-only option is used to obtain the 16-bit number for the socket’s protocol.

           <b>Note</b>

           This option is deprecated. Use the nng_socket_proto_id function instead.

       NNG_OPT_PEER
           (int) This read-only option is used to obtain the 16-bit number of the peer protocol for the socket.

           <b>Note</b>

           This option is deprecated. Use the nng_socket_peer_id function instead.

       NNG_OPT_PEER_GID
           (uint64_t) This read-only option provides a connected peer’s primary group id, when known. This is
           the effective group id of the peer when either the underlying listen() or connect() calls were made,
           and is not forgeable. This option is generally only available on POSIX systems, only on certain
           transports.

       NNG_OPT_PEER_PID
           (uint64_t) This read-only option provides the process id of the connected peer, when known. This
           option is only available on certain platforms and transports.

               <b>Note</b>

               Applications should not assume that the process ID does not change, as it may be possible for a
               process to pass a file descriptor between processes. However, it is not possible for a nefarious
               application to forge the identity of a well-behaved one using this method.

       NNG_OPT_PEER_UID
           (uint64_t) This read-only option provides a connected peer’s user id. This is the effective user id
           of the peer when either the underlying listen() or connect() calls were made, and cannot be forged.
           This option is generally only available on POSIX systems, on certain transports.

       NNG_OPT_PEER_ZONEID
           (uint64_t) This read-only option provides a connected peer’s the zone id. Zones (and this option) are
           only supported on Solaris and illumos systems, on select transports.

       NNG_OPT_PEERNAME
           (string) This read-only option is used to obtain the name of the peer protocol for the socket.

           <b>Note</b>

           This option is deprecated. Use the nng_socket_peer_name function instead.

       NNG_OPT_PROTONAME
           (string) This read-only option is used to obtain the name of the socket’s protocol.

           <b>Note</b>

           This option is deprecated. Use the nng_socket_proto_name function instead.
