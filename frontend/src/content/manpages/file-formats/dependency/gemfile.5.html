</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Gemfile</b> - A format for describing gem dependencies for Ruby programs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       A <b>Gemfile</b> describes the gem dependencies required to execute associated Ruby code.

       Place  the  <b>Gemfile</b> in the root of the directory containing the associated code. For instance, in a Rails
       application, place the <b>Gemfile</b> in the same directory as the <b>Rakefile</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       A <b>Gemfile</b> is evaluated as Ruby code, in a context which makes available  a  number  of  methods  used  to
       describe the gem requirements.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>SOURCE</b></h4><pre>
       At the top of the <b>Gemfile</b>, add a single line for the <b>RubyGems</b> source that contains the gems listed in the
       <b>Gemfile</b>.

           source "https://rubygems.org"

       You  can  add only one global source. In Bundler 1.13, adding multiple global sources was deprecated. The
       <b>source</b> <b>MUST</b> be a valid RubyGems repository.

       To use more than one source of RubyGems, you should use <b>source</b> block.

       A source is checked for gems following the heuristics described in <u>SOURCE</u> <u>PRIORITY</u>.

       <b>Note</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> <b>deprecated</b> <b>in</b> <b>Bundler</b> <b>1.13</b>: If a gem  is  found  in  more  than  one
       global  source,  Bundler  will print a warning after installing the gem indicating which source was used,
       and listing the other sources where the gem is available. A specific source can be selected for gems that
       need to use a non-standard repository, suppressing this warning, by using the <b>:source</b>  option  or  <b>source</b>
       block.

   <b>CREDENTIALS</b>
       Some  gem  sources  require a username and password. Use bundle <a href="../man1/config.1.html">config</a>(1) <u>bundle-config.1.html</u> to set the
       username and password for any of the sources that need it. The command must be run once on each  computer
       that  will install the Gemfile, but this keeps the credentials from being stored in plain text in version
       control.

           bundle config gems.example.com user:password

       For some sources, like a company Gemfury account, it may be easier to  include  the  credentials  in  the
       Gemfile as part of the source URL.

           source "https://user:<a href="mailto:password@gems.example.com">password@gems.example.com</a>"

       Credentials in the source URL will take precedence over credentials set using <b>config</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RUBY</b></h4><pre>
       If  your application requires a specific Ruby version or engine, specify your requirements using the <b>ruby</b>
       method, with the following arguments. All parameters are <b>OPTIONAL</b> unless otherwise specified.

   <b>VERSION</b> <b>(required)</b>
       The version of Ruby that your application requires.  If  your  application  requires  an  alternate  Ruby
       engine,  such  as JRuby, TruffleRuby, etc., this should be the Ruby version that the engine is compatible
       with.

           ruby "3.1.2"

       If you wish to derive your Ruby version from a version file (ie .ruby-version),  you  can  use  the  <b>file</b>
       option instead.

           ruby file: ".ruby-version"

       The version file should conform to any of the following formats:

       •   <b>3.1.2</b> (.ruby-version)

       •   <b>ruby</b> <b>3.1.2</b> (.tool-versions, read: https://asdf-vm.com/manage/configuration.html#tool-versions)

   <b>ENGINE</b>
       Each  application  <u>may</u>  specify  a Ruby engine. If an engine is specified, an engine version <u>must</u> also be
       specified.

       What exactly is an Engine?

       •   A Ruby engine is an implementation of the Ruby language.

       •   For background: the reference or original implementation of the Ruby programming language  is  called
           Matz's Ruby Interpreter <u>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_MRI</u>, or MRI for short. This is named after
           Ruby  creator  Yukihiro  Matsumoto,  also  known  as  Matz. MRI is also known as CRuby, because it is
           written in C. MRI is the most widely used Ruby engine.

       •   Other implementations <u>https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/</u> of Ruby exist. Some of the more  well-known
           implementations  include  JRuby <u>https://www.jruby.org/</u> and TruffleRuby <u>https://www.graalvm.org/ruby/</u>.
           Rubinius is an alternative implementation of Ruby written in Ruby. JRuby is an implementation of Ruby
           on the JVM, short for Java Virtual Machine. TruffleRuby is a Ruby implementation on  the  GraalVM,  a
           language toolkit built on the JVM.

   <b>ENGINE</b> <b>VERSION</b>
       Each  application  <u>may</u>  specify  a Ruby engine version. If an engine version is specified, an engine <u>must</u>
       also be specified. If the engine is "ruby" the engine version specified <u>must</u> match the Ruby version.

           ruby "2.6.8", engine: "jruby", engine_version: "9.3.8.0"

   <b>PATCHLEVEL</b>
       Each application <u>may</u> specify a Ruby patchlevel. Specifying the patchlevel has been meaningless since Ruby
       2.1.0 was released as the patchlevel is now uniquely determined by a combination  of  major,  minor,  and
       teeny version numbers.

       This option was implemented in Bundler 1.4.0 for Ruby 2.0 or earlier.

           ruby "3.1.2", patchlevel: "20"

</pre><h4><b>GEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Specify  gem requirements using the <b>gem</b> method, with the following arguments. All parameters are <b>OPTIONAL</b>
       unless otherwise specified.

   <b>NAME</b> <b>(required)</b>
       For each gem requirement, list a single <u>gem</u> line.

           gem "nokogiri"

   <b>VERSION</b>
       Each <u>gem</u> <b>MAY</b> have one or more version specifiers.

           gem "nokogiri", "&gt;= 1.4.2"
           gem "RedCloth", "&gt;= 4.1.0", "&lt; 4.2.0"

   <b>REQUIRE</b> <b>AS</b>
       Each <u>gem</u> <b>MAY</b> specify files that should be used when autorequiring via <b>Bundler.require</b>. You  may  pass  an
       array  with  multiple  files  or  <b>true</b> if the file you want <b>required</b> has the same name as <u>gem</u> or <b>false</b> to
       prevent any file from being autorequired.

           gem "redis", require: ["redis/connection/hiredis", "redis"]
           gem "webmock", require: false
           gem "byebug", require: true

       The argument defaults to the name of the gem. For example, these are identical:

           gem "nokogiri"
           gem "nokogiri", require: "nokogiri"
           gem "nokogiri", require: true

   <b>GROUPS</b>
       Each <u>gem</u> <b>MAY</b> specify membership in one or more groups. Any <u>gem</u> that does not specify  membership  in  any
       group is placed in the <b>default</b> group.

           gem "rspec", group: :test
           gem "wirble", groups: [:development, :test]

       The Bundler runtime allows its two main methods, <b>Bundler.setup</b> and <b>Bundler.require</b>, to limit their impact
       to particular groups.

           # setup adds gems to Ruby's load path
           Bundler.setup                    # defaults to all groups
           require "bundler/setup"          # same as Bundler.setup
           Bundler.setup(:default)          # only set up the _default_ group
           Bundler.setup(:test)             # only set up the _test_ group (but `not` _default_)
           Bundler.setup(:default, :test)   # set up the _default_ and _test_ groups, but no others

           # require requires all of the gems in the specified groups
           Bundler.require                  # defaults to the _default_ group
           Bundler.require(:default)        # identical
           Bundler.require(:default, :test) # requires the _default_ and _test_ groups
           Bundler.require(:test)           # requires the _test_ group

       The  Bundler CLI allows you to specify a list of groups whose gems <b>bundle</b> <b>install</b> should not install with
       the <b>without</b> configuration.

       To specify multiple groups to ignore, specify a list of groups separated by spaces.

           bundle config set --local without test
           bundle config set --local without development test

       Also, calling <b>Bundler.setup</b> with no parameters, or calling <b>require</b> <b>"bundler/setup"</b> will setup all  groups
       except for the ones you excluded via <b>--without</b> (since they are not available).

       Note  that  on  <b>bundle</b>  <b>install</b>,  bundler  downloads  and evaluates all gems, in order to create a single
       canonical list of all of the required gems and their  dependencies.  This  means  that  you  cannot  list
       different  versions  of  the  same  gems in different groups. For more details, see Understanding Bundler
       <u>https://bundler.io/rationale.html</u>.

   <b>PLATFORMS</b>
       If a gem should only be used in a particular  platform  or  set  of  platforms,  you  can  specify  them.
       Platforms  are  essentially  identical  to  groups,  except  that  you  do  not need to use the <b>--without</b>
       install-time flag to exclude groups of gems for other platforms.

       There are a number of <b>Gemfile</b> platforms:

       <b>ruby</b>   C Ruby (MRI), Rubinius, or TruffleRuby, but not Windows

       <b>mri</b>    C Ruby (MRI) only, but not Windows

       <b>windows</b>
              Windows C Ruby (MRI), including RubyInstaller 32-bit and 64-bit versions

       <b>mswin</b>  Windows C Ruby (MRI), including RubyInstaller 32-bit versions

       <b>mswin64</b>
              Windows C Ruby (MRI), including RubyInstaller 64-bit versions

       <b>rbx</b>    Rubinius

       <b>jruby</b>  JRuby

       <b>truffleruby</b>
              TruffleRuby

       On platforms <b>ruby</b>, <b>mri</b>, <b>mswin</b>, <b>mswin64</b>, and <b>windows</b>, you may additionally specify a version by  appending
       the  major  and minor version numbers without a delimiter. For example, to specify that a gem should only
       be used on platform <b>ruby</b> version 3.1, use:

           ruby_31

       As with groups (above), you may specify one or more platforms:

           gem "weakling",   platforms: :jruby
           gem "ruby-debug", platforms: :mri_31
           gem "nokogiri",   platforms: [:windows_31, :jruby]

       All operations involving groups (<b>bundle</b> <b>install</b>  <u>bundle-install.1.html</u>,  <b>Bundler.setup</b>,  <b>Bundler.require</b>)
       behave exactly the same as if any groups not matching the current platform were explicitly excluded.

       The following platform values are deprecated and should be replaced with <b>windows</b>:

       •   <b>mswin</b>, <b>mswin64</b>, <b>mingw32</b>, <b>x64_mingw</b>

       Note  that,  while unfortunately using the same terminology, the values of this option are different from
       the values that <b>bundle</b> <b>lock</b> <b>--add-platform</b> can take. The values of this option are more closer  to  "Ruby
       Implementation"  while  the values that <b>bundle</b> <b>lock</b> <b>--add-platform</b> understands are more related to OS and
       architecture of the different systems where your lockfile will be used.

   <b>FORCE_RUBY_PLATFORM</b>
       If you always want the pure ruby variant of a gem to be chosen over platform specific variants,  you  can
       use the <b>force_ruby_platform</b> option:

           gem "ffi", force_ruby_platform: true

       This can be handy (assuming the pure ruby variant works fine) when:

       •   You're having issues with the platform specific variant.

       •   The platform specific variant does not yet support a newer ruby (and thus has a <b>required_ruby_version</b>
           upper bound), but you still want your Gemfile{.lock} files to resolve under that ruby.

   <b>SOURCE</b>
       You can select an alternate RubyGems repository for a gem using the ':source' option.

           gem "some_internal_gem", source: "https://gems.example.com"

       This forces the gem to be loaded from this source and ignores the global source declared at the top level
       of the file. If the gem does not exist in this source, it will not be installed.

       Bundler  will  search  for child dependencies of this gem by first looking in the source selected for the
       parent, but if they are not found there, it will fall back on the global source.

       <b>Note</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> <b>deprecated</b> <b>in</b> <b>Bundler</b> <b>1.13</b>: Selecting a specific  source  repository
       this way also suppresses the ambiguous gem warning described above in <u>GLOBAL</u> <u>SOURCE</u>.

       Using  the <b>:source</b> option for an individual gem will also make that source available as a possible global
       source for any other gems which do not specify explicit sources. Thus, when  adding  gems  with  explicit
       sources, it is recommended that you also ensure all other gems in the Gemfile are using explicit sources.

   <b>GIT</b>
       If  necessary,  you  can  specify  that  a  gem  is located at a particular git repository using the <b>:git</b>
       parameter. The repository can be accessed via several protocols:

       <b>HTTP(S)</b>
              gem "rails", git: "https://github.com/rails/rails.git"

       <b>SSH</b>    gem "rails", git: "<a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:rails/rails.git"

       <b>git</b>    gem "rails", git: "git://github.com/rails/rails.git"

       If using SSH, the user that you use to run <b>bundle</b> <b>install</b> <b>MUST</b> have the  appropriate  keys  available  in
       their <b>$HOME/.ssh</b>.

       <b>NOTE</b>:  <b>http://</b> and <b>git://</b> URLs should be avoided if at all possible. These protocols are unauthenticated,
       so a man-in-the-middle attacker can deliver malicious code and compromise your system. HTTPS and SSH  are
       strongly preferred.

       The  <b>group</b>,  <b>platforms</b>, and <b>require</b> options are available and behave exactly the same as they would for a
       normal gem.

       A git repository <b>SHOULD</b> have at least one file, at the root of the directory containing the gem, with the
       extension <b>.gemspec</b>. This file <b>MUST</b> contain a valid gem  specification,  as  expected  by  the  <b>gem</b>  <b>build</b>
       command.

       If a git repository does not have a <b>.gemspec</b>, bundler will attempt to create one, but it will not contain
       any  dependencies,  executables,  or  C  extension  compilation instructions. As a result, it may fail to
       properly integrate into your application.

       If a git repository does have a <b>.gemspec</b> for the  gem  you  attached  it  to,  a  version  specifier,  if
       provided,  means  that  the git repository is only valid if the <b>.gemspec</b> specifies a version matching the
       version specifier. If not, bundler will print a warning.

           gem "rails", "2.3.8", git: "https://github.com/rails/rails.git"
           # bundle install will fail, because the .gemspec in the rails
           # repository's master branch specifies version 3.0.0

       If a git repository does <b>not</b> have a <b>.gemspec</b> for the gem you attached it to, a version specifier <b>MUST</b>  be
       provided. Bundler will use this version in the simple <b>.gemspec</b> it creates.

       Git repositories support a number of additional options.

       <b>branch</b>, <b>tag</b>, and <b>ref</b>
              You <b>MUST</b> only specify at most one of these options. The default is <b>branch:</b> <b>"master"</b>. For example:

              gem "rails", git: "https://github.com/rails/rails.git", branch: "5-0-stable"

              gem "rails", git: "https://github.com/rails/rails.git", tag: "v5.0.0"

              gem "rails", git: "https://github.com/rails/rails.git", ref: "4aded"

       <b>submodules</b>
              For  reference,  a git submodule <u>https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules</u> lets you have
              another git repository within a subfolder of your repository. Specify <b>submodules:</b>  <b>true</b>  to  cause
              bundler to expand any submodules included in the git repository

       If a git repository contains multiple <b>.gemspecs</b>, each <b>.gemspec</b> represents a gem located at the same place
       in the file system as the <b>.gemspec</b>.

           |~rails                   [git root]
           | |-rails.gemspec         [rails gem located here]
           |~actionpack
           | |-actionpack.gemspec    [actionpack gem located here]
           |~activesupport
           | |-activesupport.gemspec [activesupport gem located here]
           |...

       To  install  a  gem located in a git repository, bundler changes to the directory containing the gemspec,
       runs <b>gem</b> <b>build</b> <b>name.gemspec</b> and then installs the resulting gem.  The  <b>gem</b>  <b>build</b>  command,  which  comes
       standard with Rubygems, evaluates the <b>.gemspec</b> in the context of the directory in which it is located.

   <b>GIT</b> <b>SOURCE</b>
       A  custom  git source can be defined via the <b>git_source</b> method. Provide the source's name as an argument,
       and a block which receives a single argument and interpolates it into a string to return  the  full  repo
       address:

           git_source(:stash){ |repo_name| "https://stash.corp.acme.pl/#{repo_name}.git" }
           gem 'rails', stash: 'forks/rails'

       In addition, if you wish to choose a specific branch:

           gem "rails", stash: "forks/rails", branch: "branch_name"

   <b>GITHUB</b>
       <b>NOTE</b>:  This  shorthand  should  be  avoided  until Bundler 2.0, since it currently expands to an insecure
       <b>git://</b> URL. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to compromise your system.

       If the git repository you want to use is hosted on  GitHub  and  is  public,  you  can  use  the  :github
       shorthand  to specify the github username and repository name (without the trailing ".git"), separated by
       a slash. If both the username and repository name are the same, you can omit one.

           gem "rails", github: "rails/rails"
           gem "rails", github: "rails"

       Are both equivalent to

           gem "rails", git: "https://github.com/rails/rails.git"

       Since the <b>github</b> method is a specialization of <b>git_source</b>, it accepts a <b>:branch</b> named argument.

       You can also directly pass a pull request URL:

           gem "rails", github: "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/43753"

       Which is equivalent to:

           gem "rails", github: "rails/rails", branch: "refs/pull/43753/head"

   <b>GIST</b>
       If the git repository you want to use is hosted as a GitHub Gist and is public, you  can  use  the  :gist
       shorthand to specify the gist identifier (without the trailing ".git").

           gem "the_hatch", gist: "4815162342"

       Is equivalent to:

           gem "the_hatch", git: "https://gist.github.com/4815162342.git"

       Since the <b>gist</b> method is a specialization of <b>git_source</b>, it accepts a <b>:branch</b> named argument.

   <b>BITBUCKET</b>
       If  the  git  repository you want to use is hosted on Bitbucket and is public, you can use the :bitbucket
       shorthand to specify the bitbucket username and repository name (without the trailing ".git"),  separated
       by a slash. If both the username and repository name are the same, you can omit one.

           gem "rails", bitbucket: "rails/rails"
           gem "rails", bitbucket: "rails"

       Are both equivalent to

           gem "rails", git: "https://<a href="mailto:rails@bitbucket.org">rails@bitbucket.org</a>/rails/rails.git"

       Since the <b>bitbucket</b> method is a specialization of <b>git_source</b>, it accepts a <b>:branch</b> named argument.

   <b>PATH</b>
       You  can  specify  that  a gem is located in a particular location on the file system. Relative paths are
       resolved relative to the directory containing the <b>Gemfile</b>.

       Similar to the semantics of the <b>:git</b> option, the <b>:path</b> option requires that  the  directory  in  question
       either contains a <b>.gemspec</b> for the gem, or that you specify an explicit version that bundler should use.

       Unlike <b>:git</b>, bundler does not compile C extensions for gems specified as paths.

           gem "rails", path: "vendor/rails"

       If  you  would  like  to  use multiple local gems directly from the filesystem, you can set a global <b>path</b>
       option to the path  containing  the  gem's  files.  This  will  automatically  load  gemspec  files  from
       subdirectories.

           path 'components' do
             gem 'admin_ui'
             gem 'public_ui'
           end

</pre><h4><b>BLOCK</b> <b>FORM</b> <b>OF</b> <b>SOURCE,</b> <b>GIT,</b> <b>PATH,</b> <b>GROUP</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLATFORMS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>:source</b>, <b>:git</b>, <b>:path</b>, <b>:group</b>, and <b>:platforms</b> options may be applied to a group of gems by using block
       form.

           source "https://gems.example.com" do
             gem "some_internal_gem"

           end

           group :development, optional: true do
             gem "wirble"
             gem "faker"
           end

       In  the  case  of  the  group  block form the :optional option can be given to prevent a group from being
       installed unless listed in the <b>--with</b> option given to the <b>bundle</b> <b>install</b> command.

       In the case of the <b>git</b> block form, the <b>:ref</b>, <b>:branch</b>, <b>:tag</b>, and <b>:submodules</b> options may be passed to  the
       <b>git</b> method, and all gems in the block will inherit those options.

       The  presence of a <b>source</b> block in a Gemfile also makes that source available as a possible global source
       for any other gems which do not specify explicit sources.  Thus,  when  defining  source  blocks,  it  is
       recommended  that  you  also  ensure all other gems in the Gemfile are using explicit sources, either via
       source blocks or <b>:source</b> directives on individual gems.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALL_IF</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>install_if</b> method allows gems to be installed based on a proc or lambda. This  is  especially  useful
       for  optional  gems  that  can only be used if certain software is installed or some other conditions are
       met.

           install_if -&gt; { RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /darwin/ } do
             gem "pasteboard"
           end

</pre><h4><b>GEMSPEC</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>.gemspec</b> <u>https://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/</u> file  is  where  you  provide  metadata
       about  your gem to Rubygems. Some required Gemspec attributes include the name, description, and homepage
       of your gem. This is also where you specify the dependencies your gem needs to run.

       If you wish to use Bundler to help install dependencies for a gem while it is being  developed,  use  the
       <b>gemspec</b> method to pull in the dependencies listed in the <b>.gemspec</b> file.

       The  <b>gemspec</b>  method adds any runtime dependencies as gem requirements in the default group. It also adds
       development dependencies as gem requirements in the <b>development</b> group. Finally, it adds a gem requirement
       on your project (<b>path:</b> <b>'.'</b>). In conjunction with <b>Bundler.setup</b>, this allows you to require project  files
       in  your  test code as you would if the project were installed as a gem; you need not manipulate the load
       path manually or require project files via relative paths.

       The <b>gemspec</b> method supports optional <b>:path</b>, <b>:glob</b>, <b>:name</b>, and <b>:development_group</b> options,  which  control
       where  bundler  looks  for  the  <b>.gemspec</b>,  the  glob  it  uses  to  look  for  the gemspec (defaults to:
       <b>{,*,*/*}.gemspec</b>), what named <b>.gemspec</b> it uses (if more than one is present), and which group development
       dependencies are included in.

       When a <b>gemspec</b> dependency encounters  version  conflicts  during  resolution,  the  local  version  under
       development  will  always  be  selected  --  even  if  there  are remote versions that better match other
       requirements for the <b>gemspec</b> gem.

</pre><h4><b>SOURCE</b> <b>PRIORITY</b></h4><pre>
       When attempting to locate a gem to satisfy a gem requirement, bundler uses the following priority order:

       1.  The source explicitly attached to the gem (using <b>:source</b>, <b>:path</b>, or <b>:git</b>)

       2.  For implicit gems (dependencies of explicit gems), any source, git, or path  repository  declared  on
           the  parent. This results in bundler prioritizing the ActiveSupport gem from the Rails git repository
           over ones from <b>rubygems.org</b>

       3.  If neither of the above conditions are met, the global  source  will  be  used.  If  multiple  global
           sources  are  specified,  they  will  be prioritized from last to first, but this is deprecated since
           Bundler 1.13, so Bundler prints a warning and will abort with an error in the future.
