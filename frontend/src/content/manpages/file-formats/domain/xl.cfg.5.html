</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xl.cfg - xl domain configuration file syntax

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        /etc/xen/xldomain

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Creating a VM (a domain in Xen terminology, sometimes called a guest) with xl requires the provision of a
       domain configuration file.  Typically, these live in <u>/etc/xen/DOMAIN.cfg</u>, where DOMAIN is the name of the
       domain.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       A domain configuration file consists of a series of options, specified by using "KEY=VALUE" pairs.

       Some "KEY"s are mandatory, some are general options which apply to any guest type, while others relate
       only to specific guest types (e.g. PV or HVM guests).

       A "VALUE" can be one of:

       <b>"STRING"</b>
           A  string,  surrounded by either single or double quotes. But if the STRING is part of a SPEC_STRING,
           the quotes should be omitted.

       <b>NUMBER</b>
           A number, in either decimal, octal (using a 0 prefix) or hexadecimal (using a "0x" prefix) format.

       <b>BOOLEAN</b>
           A "NUMBER" interpreted as "False" (0) or "True" (any other value).

       <b>[</b> <b>VALUE,</b> <b>VALUE,</b> <b>...</b> <b>]</b>
           A list of "VALUE"s of the above types. Lists can be heterogeneous and nested.

       The semantics of each "KEY" defines which type of "VALUE" is required.

       Pairs may be separated either by a newline or a semicolon.  Both of the following are valid:

         name="h0"
         type="hvm"

         name="h0"; type="hvm"

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Mandatory</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Items</b>
       The following key is mandatory for any guest type.

       <b>name="NAME"</b>
           Specifies the name of the domain.  Names of domains existing on a single host must be unique.

   <b>Selecting</b> <b>Guest</b> <b>Type</b>
       <b>type="pv"</b>
           Specifies that this is to be a PV domain, suitable for hosting  Xen-aware  guest  operating  systems.
           This is the default on x86.

       <b>type="pvh"</b>
           Specifies  that  this  is  to be an PVH domain. That is a lightweight HVM-like guest without a device
           model and without many of the emulated devices available to HVM guests. Note that this mode  requires
           a PVH aware kernel on x86. This is the default on Arm.

       <b>type="hvm"</b>
           Specifies that this is to be an HVM domain. That is, a fully virtualised computer with emulated BIOS,
           disk and network peripherals, etc.

       <u>Deprecated</u> <u>guest</u> <u>type</u> <u>selection</u>

       Note that the builder option is being deprecated in favor of the type option.

       <b>builder="generic"</b>
           Specifies  that  this  is  to be a PV domain, suitable for hosting Xen-aware guest operating systems.
           This is the default.

       <b>builder="hvm"</b>
           Specifies that this is to be an HVM domain.  That is, a  fully  virtualised  computer  with  emulated
           BIOS, disk and network peripherals, etc.

   <b>General</b> <b>Options</b>
       The following options apply to guests of any type.

       <u>CPU</u> <u>Allocation</u>

       <b>pool="CPUPOOLNAME"</b>
           Put the guest's vCPUs into the named CPU pool.

       <b>vcpus=N</b>
           Start the guest with N vCPUs initially online.

       <b>maxvcpus=M</b>
           Allow  the  guest  to bring up a maximum of M vCPUs. When starting the guest, if <b>vcpus=N</b> is less than
           <b>maxvcpus=M</b> then the first <b>N</b> vCPUs will be created online and the remainder will be created offline.

       <b>cpus="CPULIST"</b>
           List of host CPUs the guest is allowed to use. Default is no pinning at all (more on this  below).  A
           "CPULIST" may be specified as follows:

           "all"
               To allow all the vCPUs of the guest to run on all the CPUs on the host.

           "0-3,5,^1"
               To  allow  all the vCPUs of the guest to run on CPUs 0,2,3,5. It is possible to combine this with
               "all", meaning "all,^7" results in all the vCPUs of the guest being allowed to  run  on  all  the
               CPUs of the host except CPU 7.

           "nodes:0-3,^node:2"
               To  allow all the vCPUs of the guest to run on the CPUs from NUMA nodes 0,1,3 of the host. So, if
               CPUs 0-3 belong to node 0, CPUs 4-7 belong to node 1, CPUs 8-11 to node 2 and CPUs 12-15 to  node
               3, the above would mean all the vCPUs of the guest would be allowed to run on CPUs 0-7,12-15.

               Combining  this  notation  with the one above is possible. For instance, "1,node:1,^6", means all
               the vCPUs of the guest will run on CPU 1 and on all the CPUs of NUMA node 1, but not  on  CPU  6.
               Following the same example as above, that would be CPUs 1,4,5,7.

               Combining this with "all" is also possible, meaning "all,^node:1" results in all the vCPUs of the
               guest running on all the CPUs on the host, except for the CPUs belonging to the host NUMA node 1.

           ["2", "3-8,^5"]
               To  ask  for specific vCPU mapping. That means (in this example), vCPU 0 of the guest will run on
               CPU 2 of the host and vCPU 1 of the guest will run on CPUs 3,4,6,7,8 of the host  (excluding  CPU
               5).

               More complex notation can be also used, exactly as described above. So "all,^5-8", or just "all",
               or "node:0,node:2,^9-11,18-20" are all legal, for each element of the list.

           If  this  option  is not specified, no vCPU to CPU pinning is established, and the vCPUs of the guest
           can run on all the CPUs of the host. If this option  is  specified,  the  intersection  of  the  vCPU
           pinning  mask,  provided here, and the soft affinity mask, if provided via <b>cpus_soft=</b>, is utilized to
           compute the domain node-affinity for driving memory allocations.

       <b>cpus_soft="CPULIST"</b>
           Exactly as <b>cpus=</b>, but specifies soft affinity, rather than pinning (hard affinity).  When  using  the
           credit scheduler, this means what CPUs the vCPUs of the domain prefer.

           A "CPULIST" is specified exactly as for <b>cpus=</b>, detailed earlier in the manual.

           If  this  option is not specified, the vCPUs of the guest will not have any preference regarding host
           CPUs. If this option is specified, the intersection of the soft affinity mask, provided here, and the
           vCPU pinning, if provided via <b>cpus=</b>, is utilized to compute  the  domain  node-affinity  for  driving
           memory allocations.

           If  this  option  is  not specified (and <b>cpus=</b> is not specified either), libxl automatically tries to
           place the guest on the least possible number of nodes. A heuristic approach is used for choosing  the
           best  node  (or set of nodes), with the goal of maximizing performance for the guest and, at the same
           time, achieving efficient utilization of host CPUs and memory. In that case, the soft affinity of all
           the vCPUs of the domain will be set to host CPUs belonging to NUMA nodes chosen during placement.

           For more details, see <b><a href="../man7/xl-numa-placement.7.html">xl-numa-placement</a></b>(7).

       <u>CPU</u> <u>Scheduling</u>

       <b>cpu_weight=WEIGHT</b>
           A domain with a weight of 512 will get twice as much CPU as a domain  with  a  weight  of  256  on  a
           contended  host.  Legal weights range from 1 to 65535 and the default is 256.  Honoured by the credit
           and credit2 schedulers.

       <b>cap=N</b>
           The cap optionally fixes the maximum amount of CPU a domain will be able to consume, even if the host
           system has idle CPU cycles.  The cap is expressed as a percentage of  one  physical  CPU:  100  is  1
           physical CPU, 50 is half a CPU, 400 is 4 CPUs, etc.  The default, 0, means there is no cap.  Honoured
           by the credit and credit2 schedulers.

           <b>NOTE</b>:  Many  systems have features that will scale down the computing power of a CPU that is not 100%
           utilized.  This can be done in the operating system,  but  can  also  sometimes  be  done  below  the
           operating  system, in the BIOS.  If you set a cap such that individual cores are running at less than
           100%, this may have an impact on the performance of your workload over and above the  impact  of  the
           cap.  For  example,  if  your  processor  runs at 2GHz, and you cap a VM at 50%, the power management
           system may also reduce the clock speed to 1GHz; the effect will be that  your  VM  gets  25%  of  the
           available  power (50% of 1GHz) rather than 50% (50% of 2GHz).  If you are not getting the performance
           you expect, look at performance and CPU frequency options in your operating system and your BIOS.

       <u>Memory</u> <u>Allocation</u>

       <b>memory=MBYTES</b>
           Start the guest with MBYTES megabytes of RAM.

       <b>maxmem=MBYTES</b>
           Specifies the maximum amount of memory a guest can ever see.  The value of <b>maxmem=</b> must be  equal  to
           or greater than that of <b>memory=</b>.

           In  combination  with  <b>memory=</b>  it will start the guest "pre-ballooned", if the values of <b>memory=</b> and
           <b>maxmem=</b> differ.  A "pre-ballooned" HVM guest needs a balloon driver, without a balloon driver it will
           crash.

           <b>NOTE</b>: Because of the way ballooning works, the guest has to allocate memory to keep track  of  maxmem
           pages, regardless of how much memory it actually has available to it.  A guest with maxmem=262144 and
           memory=8096  will  report  significantly less memory available for use than a system with maxmem=8096
           memory=8096 due to the memory overhead of having to track the unused pages.

       <u>Guest</u> <u>Virtual</u> <u>NUMA</u> <u>Configuration</u>

       <b>vnuma=[</b> <b>VNODE_SPEC,</b> <b>VNODE_SPEC,</b> <b>...</b> <b>]</b>
           Specify virtual NUMA configuration  with  positional  arguments.  The  nth  <b>VNODE_SPEC</b>  in  the  list
           specifies the configuration of the nth virtual node.

           Note  that  virtual NUMA is not supported for PV guests yet, because there is an issue with the CPUID
           instruction handling that affects PV virtual NUMA. Furthermore, guests with virtual  NUMA  cannot  be
           saved or migrated because the migration stream does not preserve node information.

           Each  <b>VNODE_SPEC</b>  is  a  list, which has a form of "[VNODE_CONFIG_OPTION, VNODE_CONFIG_OPTION, ... ]"
           (without the quotes).

           For example, vnuma = [  ["pnode=0","size=512","vcpus=0-4","vdistances=10,20"]  ]  means  vnode  0  is
           mapped  to pnode 0, has 512MB ram, has vcpus 0 to 4, the distance to itself is 10 and the distance to
           vnode 1 is 20.

           Each <b>VNODE_CONFIG_OPTION</b> is a quoted "KEY=VALUE" pair. Supported <b>VNODE_CONFIG_OPTION</b>s are  (they  are
           all mandatory at the moment):

           <b>pnode=NUMBER</b>
               Specifies which physical node this virtual node maps to.

           <b>size=MBYTES</b>
               Specifies  the  size  of  this  virtual  node.  The sum of memory sizes of all vnodes will become
               <b>maxmem=</b>. If <b>maxmem=</b> is specified separately, a check is performed to make sure  the  sum  of  all
               vnode memory matches <b>maxmem=</b>.

           <b>vcpus="CPUSTRING"</b>
               Specifies  which vCPUs belong to this node. <b>"CPUSTRING"</b> is a string of numerical values separated
               by a comma. You can specify a range and/or a single CPU.   An  example  would  be  "vcpus=0-5,8",
               which means you specified vCPU 0 to vCPU 5, and vCPU 8.

           <b>vdistances=NUMBER,</b> <b>NUMBER,</b> <b>...</b>
               Specifies  the  virtual  distance  from this node to all nodes (including itself) with positional
               arguments. For example, "vdistance=10,20" for vnode 0 means the distance from vnode 0 to vnode  0
               is  10,  from  vnode  0  to  vnode 1 is 20. The number of arguments supplied must match the total
               number of vnodes.

               Normally you can use the values from <b>xl</b> <b>info</b> <b>-n</b> or <b>numactl</b>  <b>--hardware</b>  to  fill  the  vdistances
               list.

       <u>Event</u> <u>Actions</u>

       <b>on_poweroff="ACTION"</b>
           Specifies what should be done with the domain if it shuts itself down.  The <b>ACTION</b>s are:

           <b>destroy</b>
               destroy the domain

           <b>restart</b>
               destroy the domain and immediately create a new domain with the same configuration

           <b>rename-restart</b>
               rename  the  domain  which  terminated,  and  then  immediately create a new domain with the same
               configuration as the original

           <b>preserve</b>
               keep the domain.  It can be examined, and later destroyed with <b>xl</b> <b>destroy</b>.

           <b>coredump-destroy</b>
               write a "coredump" of the domain to <u>/var/lib/xen/dump/NAME</u> and then destroy the domain.

           <b>coredump-restart</b>
               write a "coredump" of the domain to <u>/var/lib/xen/dump/NAME</u> and then restart the domain.

           <b>soft-reset</b>
               Reset all Xen specific interfaces for the Xen-aware HVM domain allowing it to  reestablish  these
               interfaces and continue executing the domain. PV and non-Xen-aware HVM guests are not supported.

           The default for <b>on_poweroff</b> is <b>destroy</b>.

       <b>on_reboot="ACTION"</b>
           Action to take if the domain shuts down with a reason code requesting a reboot.  Default is <b>restart</b>.

       <b>on_watchdog="ACTION"</b>
           Action to take if the domain shuts down due to a Xen watchdog timeout.  Default is <b>destroy</b>.

       <b>on_crash="ACTION"</b>
           Action to take if the domain crashes.  Default is <b>destroy</b>.

       <b>on_soft_reset="ACTION"</b>
           Action to take if the domain performs a 'soft reset' (e.g. does <b>kexec</b>).  Default is <b>soft-reset</b>.

       <u>Direct</u> <u>Kernel</u> <u>Boot</u>

       Direct  kernel boot allows booting guests with a kernel and an initrd stored on a filesystem available to
       the host physical machine, allowing command line arguments to be passed directly. PV guest direct  kernel
       boot  is  supported. HVM guest direct kernel boot is supported with some limitations (it's supported when
       using <b>qemu-xen</b> and the default BIOS 'seabios', but not supported in case of using <b>stubdom-dm</b> and the  old
       'rombios'.)

       <b>kernel="PATHNAME"</b>
           Load the specified file as the kernel image.

       <b>ramdisk="PATHNAME"</b>
           Load the specified file as the ramdisk.

       <b>cmdline="STRING"</b>
           Append  <b>STRING</b>  to  the  kernel  command  line. (Note: the meaning of this is guest specific). It can
           replace <b>root="STRING"</b> along with <b>extra="STRING"</b> and  is  preferred.  When  <b>cmdline="STRING"</b>  is  set,
           <b>root="STRING"</b> and <b>extra="STRING"</b> will be ignored.

       <b>root="STRING"</b>
           Append <b>root=STRING</b> to the kernel command line (Note: the meaning of this is guest specific).

       <b>extra="STRING"</b>
           Append <b>STRING</b> to the kernel command line. (Note: the meaning of this is guest specific).

       <u>Non</u> <u>direct</u> <u>Kernel</u> <u>Boot</u>

       Non  direct  kernel  boot allows booting guests with a firmware. This can be used by all types of guests,
       although the selection of options is different depending on the guest type.

       This option provides the flexibly of letting the guest decide which  kernel  they  want  to  boot,  while
       preventing having to poke at the guest file system form the toolstack domain.

       PV guest options

       <b>firmware="pvgrub32|pvgrub64"</b>
           Boots  a guest using a para-virtualized version of grub that runs inside of the guest. The bitness of
           the guest needs to be know, so that the right version of pvgrub can be selected.

           Note that xl expects to find the pvgrub32.bin and pvgrub64.bin binaries in <u>/usr/lib/xen-4.20/boot</u>.

       HVM guest options

       <b>firmware="bios"</b>
           Boot the guest using the default BIOS firmware, which depends on the chosen device model.

       <b>firmware="uefi"</b>
           Boot the guest using the default UEFI firmware, currently OVMF.

       <b>firmware="seabios"</b>
           Boot the guest using the SeaBIOS BIOS firmware.

       <b>firmware="rombios"</b>
           Boot the guest using the ROMBIOS BIOS firmware.

       <b>firmware="ovmf"</b>
           Boot the guest using the OVMF UEFI firmware.

       <b>firmware="PATH"</b>
           Load the specified file as firmware for the guest.

       PVH guest options

       Currently there's no firmware available for PVH guests, they should be booted  using  the  <b>Direct</b>  <b>Kernel</b>
       <b>Boot</b> method or the <b>bootloader</b> option.

       <b>pvshim=BOOLEAN</b>
           Whether  to boot this guest as a PV guest within a PVH container.  Ie, the guest will experience a PV
           environment, but processor hardware extensions are used to separate its address space to mitigate the
           Meltdown attack (CVE-2017-5754).

           Default is false.

       <b>pvshim_path="PATH"</b>
           The PV shim is a specially-built firmware-like executable  constructed  from  the  hypervisor  source
           tree.  This option specifies to use a non-default shim.  Ignored if pvhsim is false.

       <b>pvshim_cmdline="STRING"</b>
           Command line for the shim.  Default is "pv-shim console=xen,pv".  Ignored if pvhsim is false.

       <b>pvshim_extra="STRING"</b>
           Extra  command  line  arguments for the shim.  If supplied, appended to the value for pvshim_cmdline.
           Default is empty.  Ignored if pvhsim is false.

       <u>Other</u> <u>Options</u>

       <b>uuid="UUID"</b>
           Specifies the UUID of the domain.  If not specified, a fresh unique UUID will be generated.

       <b>seclabel="LABEL"</b>
           Assign an XSM security label to this domain.

       <b>init_seclabel="LABEL"</b>
           Specify an XSM security label used for this domain temporarily during its  build.  The  domain's  XSM
           label  will  be changed to the execution seclabel (specified by <b>seclabel</b>) once the build is complete,
           prior to unpausing the domain. With a properly constructed security policy (such  as  nomigrate_t  in
           the  example  policy),  this  can  be  used  to  build a domain whose memory is not accessible to the
           toolstack domain.

       <b>max_grant_frames=NUMBER</b>
           Specify the maximum number of grant frames the domain is allowed to have.  This  value  controls  how
           many  pages the domain is able to grant access to for other domains, needed e.g. for the operation of
           paravirtualized devices.  The default is settable via <b><a href="../man5/xl.conf.5.html">xl.conf</a></b>(5).

       <b>max_maptrack_frames=NUMBER</b>
           Specify the maximum number of grant maptrack frames  the  domain  is  allowed  to  have.  This  value
           controls  how  many  pages of foreign domains can be accessed via the grant mechanism by this domain.
           The default value is settable via <b><a href="../man5/xl.conf.5.html">xl.conf</a></b>(5).

       <b>max_grant_version=NUMBER</b>
           Specify the maximum grant table version the domain is allowed to use. The default value  is  settable
           via <b><a href="../man5/xl.conf.5.html">xl.conf</a></b>(5).

       <b>nomigrate=BOOLEAN</b>
           Disable  migration  of  this domain.  This enables certain other features which are incompatible with
           migration. Currently this is limited to enabling the invariant TSC feature flag in CPUID results when
           TSC is not emulated.

       <b>driver_domain=BOOLEAN</b>
           Specify that this domain is a driver domain. This enables certain features needed in order to  run  a
           driver domain.

       <b>device_tree=PATH</b>
           Specify  a  partial  device  tree (compiled via the Device Tree Compiler).  Everything under the node
           "/passthrough" will be copied into the guest device tree. For convenience,  the  node  "/aliases"  is
           also copied to allow the user to define aliases which can be used by the guest kernel.

           Given the complexity of verifying the validity of a device tree, this option should only be used with
           a trusted device tree.

           Note  that  the  partial  device  tree  should avoid using the phandle 65000 which is reserved by the
           toolstack.

       <b>passthrough="STRING"</b>
           Specify whether IOMMU mappings are enabled for the domain and hence whether it will  be  enabled  for
           passthrough hardware. Valid values for this option are:

           <b>disabled</b>
               IOMMU mappings are disabled for the domain and so hardware may not be passed through.

               This option is the default if no passthrough hardware is specified in the domain's configuration.

           <b>enabled</b>
               This  option  enables IOMMU mappings and selects an appropriate default operating mode (see below
               for details of the operating modes). For HVM/PVH domains running on platforms where the option is
               available, this is equivalent to <b>share_pt</b>. Otherwise, and also for PV  domains,  this  option  is
               equivalent to <b>sync_pt</b>.

               This option is the default if passthrough hardware is specified in the domain's configuration.

           <b>sync_pt</b>
               This  option  means  that  IOMMU  mappings  will  be  synchronized with the domain's P2M table as
               follows:

               For a PV domain, all writable pages assigned to the domain are identity  mapped  by  MFN  in  the
               IOMMU page table. Thus a device driver running in the domain may program passthrough hardware for
               DMA using MFN values (i.e. host/machine frame numbers) looked up in its P2M.

               For  an HVM/PVH domain, all non-foreign RAM pages present in its P2M will be mapped by GFN in the
               IOMMU page table. Thus a device driver running in the domain  may  program  passthrough  hardware
               using GFN values (i.e. guest physical frame numbers) without any further translation.

               This option is not currently available on Arm.

           <b>share_pt</b>
               This  option  is  unavailable  for a PV domain. For an HVM/PVH domain, this option means that the
               IOMMU will be programmed to directly reference the domain's P2M table as its page table. From the
               point of view of a device driver running in the domain this is functionally equivalent to <b>sync_pt</b>
               but places less load on the hypervisor  and  so  should  generally  be  selected  in  preference.
               However,  the  availability  of  this  option  is hardware specific. If <b>xl</b> <b>info</b> reports <b>virt_caps</b>
               containing <b>iommu_hap_pt_share</b> then this option may be used.

           <b>default</b>
               The default, which chooses between <b>disabled</b> and <b>enabled</b> according to whether passthrough  devices
               are enabled in the config file.

       <b>xend_suspend_evtchn_compat=BOOLEAN</b>
           If  this option is <b>true</b> the xenstore path for the domain's suspend event channel will not be created.
           Instead the old xend behaviour of making the whole xenstore <b>device</b> sub-tree writable  by  the  domain
           will be re-instated.

           The existence of the suspend event channel path can cause problems with certain PV drivers running in
           the guest (e.g. old Red Hat PV drivers for Windows).

           If this option is not specified then it will default to <b>false</b>.

       <b>vmtrace_buf_kb=KBYTES</b>
           Specifies  the size of vmtrace buffer that would be allocated for each vCPU belonging to this domain.
           Disabled (i.e.  <b>vmtrace_buf_kb=0</b>) by default.

           <b>NOTE</b>: Acceptable values are platform specific.  For Intel Processor Trace, this value must be a power
           of 2 between 4k and 16M.

       <b>vpmu=BOOLEAN</b>
           Currently ARM only.

           Specifies whether to enable the access to PMU registers by disabling the PMU traps.

           The PMU registers are not virtualized and the physical registers are directly  accessible  when  this
           parameter is enabled. There is no interrupt support and Xen will not save/restore the register values
           on context switches.

           vPMU,  by  design  and purpose, exposes system level performance information to the guest. Only to be
           used by sufficiently privileged domains. This feature is currently in experimental state.

           If this option is not specified then it will default to <b>false</b>.

   <b>Devices</b>
       The following options define the paravirtual, emulated and physical devices which the guest will contain.

       <b>disk=[</b> <b>"DISK_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>"DISK_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Specifies the disks (both emulated disks and Xen virtual block devices) which are to be  provided  to
           the  guest,  and  what objects on the host they should map to.  See <b><a href="../man5/xl-disk-configuration.5.html">xl-disk-configuration</a></b>(5) for more
           details.

       <b>vif=[</b> <b>"NET_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>"NET_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Specifies the network interfaces (both emulated network adapters, and Xen virtual  interfaces)  which
           are to be provided to the guest.  See <b><a href="../man5/xl-network-configuration.5.html">xl-network-configuration</a></b>(5) for more details.

       <b>vtpm=[</b> <b>"VTPM_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>"VTPM_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Specifies  the  Virtual Trusted Platform module to be provided to the guest. See <b><a href="../man7/xen-vtpm.7.html">xen-vtpm</a></b>(7) for more
           details.

           Each <b>VTPM_SPEC_STRING</b> is a comma-separated list of "KEY=VALUE" settings from the following list:

           <b>backend=domain-id</b>
               Specifies the backend domain name or id. <b>This</b> <b>value</b> <b>is</b> <b>required!</b>  If this domain is a guest,  the
               backend  should  be  set to the vTPM domain name. If this domain is a vTPM, the backend should be
               set to the vTPM manager domain name.

           <b>uuid=UUID</b>
               Specifies the UUID of this vTPM device. The UUID is used to uniquely identify  the  vTPM  device.
               You  can create one using the <b><a href="../man1/uuidgen.1.html">uuidgen</a>(1)</b> program on unix systems. If left unspecified, a new UUID
               will be randomly generated every time the domain boots.  If this is a  vTPM  domain,  you  should
               specify a value. The value is optional if this is a guest domain.

       <b>p9=[</b> <b>"9PFS_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>"9PFS_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Creates a Xen 9pfs connection to share a filesystem from the backend to the frontend.

           Each <b>9PFS_SPEC_STRING</b> is a comma-separated list of "KEY=VALUE" settings, from the following list:

           <b>type=TYPE</b>
               The backendtype for the PV device. Supported values are <b>qemu</b> and <b>xen_9pfsd</b>.  The default is <b>qemu</b>.

           <b>tag=STRING</b>
               9pfs  tag  to identify the filesystem share. The tag is needed on the guest side to mount it. For
               the backendtype of <b>xen_9pfsd</b> the tag defaults to "Xen".

           <b>security_model="none"</b>
               Only "none" is supported today, which means that the files are stored using the same  credentials
               as those they have in the guest (no user ownership squash or remap).

           <b>path=STRING</b>
               Filesystem  path  on the backend to export. For the backendtype of <b>xen_9pfsd</b> the path defaults to
               "/var/log/xen/guests/&lt;guest-name&gt;".

           <b>backend=domain-id</b>
               Specify the backend domain name or id, defaults to dom0.

           <b>max-files=NUMBER</b>
               Specify the maximum number of files below <b>path</b>. A value of 0 (which is the default) doesn't limit
               the number of files. Only valid for <b>type=xen_9pfsd</b>.

           <b>max-open-files=NUMBER</b>
               Specify the maximum number of concurrently opened files below <b>path</b>.  Multiple opens of  the  same
               file   are  counted  individually.  Only  valid  for  <b>type=xen_9pfsd</b>,  which  has  a  default  of
               <b>max-open-files=5</b>.

           <b>max-space=NUMBER</b>
               Specify the maximum used disk space in MiB below <b>path</b>. A  value  of  0  (which  is  the  default)
               doesn't limit the usable disk space. Only valid for <b>type=xen_9pfsd</b>.

           <b>auto-delete=BOOLEAN</b>
               When  set  the  backend will delete the oldest file which is currently not opened by the guest in
               case the disk space limit set via <b>max-space</b> or the file limit set via <b>max-files</b> is being reached.
               Only valid for <b>type=xen_9pfsd</b>.

       <b>pvcalls=[</b> <b>"backend=domain-id",</b> <b>...</b> <b>]</b>
           Creates a Xen pvcalls connection to handle pvcalls requests from frontend to backend. It can be  used
           as   an   alternative   networking   model.    For   more   information   about   the  protocol,  see
           https://xenbits.xenproject.org/docs/unstable/misc/pvcalls.html.

       <b>vfb=[</b> <b>"VFB_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>"VFB_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Specifies the paravirtual framebuffer devices which should be supplied to the domain.

           This option does not control the emulated graphics card presented to an HVM guest. See  <b>Emulated</b>  <b>VGA</b>
           <b>Graphics</b>  <b>Device</b>  below  for  how  to  configure the emulated device. If <b>Emulated</b> <b>VGA</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Device</b>
           options are used in a PV guest configuration, <b>xl</b> will pick up <b>vnc</b>, <b>vnclisten</b>, <b>vncpasswd</b>,  <b>vncdisplay</b>,
           <b>vncunused</b>, <b>sdl</b>, <b>opengl</b> and <b>keymap</b> to construct the paravirtual framebuffer device for the guest.

           Each <b>VFB_SPEC_STRING</b> is a comma-separated list of "KEY=VALUE" settings, from the following list:

           <b>vnc=BOOLEAN</b>
               Allow  access  to the display via the VNC protocol.  This enables the other VNC-related settings.
               Default is 1 (enabled).

           <b>vnclisten=ADDRESS[:DISPLAYNUM]</b>
               Specifies the IP address, and optionally the VNC display number, to use.

               Note: if you specify the display number here, you should not use the <b>vncdisplay</b> option.

           <b>vncdisplay=DISPLAYNUM</b>
               Specifies the VNC display number to use.  The actual TCP port number will be DISPLAYNUM+5900.

               Note: you should not use this option if you set the DISPLAYNUM in the <b>vnclisten</b> option.

           <b>vncunused=BOOLEAN</b>
               Requests that the VNC display setup searches for a free TCP port to use.  The actual display used
               can be accessed with <b>xl</b> <b>vncviewer</b>.

           <b>vncpasswd=PASSWORD</b>
               Specifies the password for  the  VNC  server.  If  the  password  is  set  to  an  empty  string,
               authentication on the VNC server will be disabled, allowing any user to connect.

           <b>sdl=BOOLEAN</b>
               Specifies  that the display should be presented via an X window (using Simple DirectMedia Layer).
               The default is 0 (not enabled).

           <b>display=DISPLAY</b>
               Specifies the X Window display that should be used when the <b>sdl</b> option is used.

           <b>xauthority=XAUTHORITY</b>
               Specifies the path to the X authority file that should be used to connect to the  X  server  when
               the <b>sdl</b> option is used.

           <b>opengl=BOOLEAN</b>
               Enable    OpenGL    acceleration    of   the   SDL   display.   Only   effects   machines   using
               <b>device_model_version="qemu-xen-traditional"</b> and only if the device-model was compiled with OpenGL
               support. The default is 0 (disabled).

           <b>keymap=LANG</b>
               Configure the keymap to use for the keyboard associated with this display. If  the  input  method
               does  not  easily  support  raw  keycodes  (e.g. this is often the case when using VNC) then this
               allows us to correctly map the input keys into keycodes seen by the guest.  The  specific  values
               which  are  accepted  are  defined  by  the  version of the device-model which you are using. See
               <b>Keymaps</b> below or consult the <b><a href="../man1/qemu.1.html">qemu</a>(1)</b> manpage. The default is <b>en-us</b>.

       <b>channel=[</b> <b>"CHANNEL_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>"CHANNEL_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Specifies the virtual  channels  to  be  provided  to  the  guest.  A  channel  is  a  low-bandwidth,
           bidirectional  byte  stream,  which  resembles  a  serial  link.  Typical  uses  for channels include
           transmitting  VM  configuration  after  boot  and  signalling  to   in-guest   agents.   Please   see
           <b><a href="../man7/xen-pv-channel.7.html">xen-pv-channel</a></b>(7) for more details.

           Each  <b>CHANNEL_SPEC_STRING</b>  is  a  comma-separated  list of "KEY=VALUE" settings. Leading and trailing
           whitespace is ignored in both KEY and VALUE. Neither KEY nor VALUE  may  contain  ',',  '='  or  '"'.
           Defined values are:

           <b>backend=domain-id</b>
               Specifies the backend domain name or id. This parameter is optional. If this parameter is omitted
               then the toolstack domain will be assumed.

           <b>name=NAME</b>
               Specifies  the  name  for  this device. <b>This</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>is</b> <b>mandatory!</b>  This should be a well-known
               name for a specific application (e.g.  guest agent) and should be used by the frontend to connect
               the application to the right channel device. There is no formal registry  of  channel  names,  so
               application  authors are encouraged to make their names unique by including the domain name and a
               version number in the string (e.g. org.mydomain.guestagent.1).

           <b>connection=CONNECTION</b>
               Specifies how the backend will be implemented. The following options are available:

               <b>SOCKET</b>
                   The backend will bind a Unix domain socket (at the path given by <b>path=PATH</b>), listen  for  and
                   accept connections. The backend will proxy data between the channel and the connected socket.

               <b>PTY</b> The  backend  will create a pty and proxy data between the channel and the master device. The
                   command <b>xl</b> <b>channel-list</b> can be used to discover the assigned slave device.

       <b>rdm="RDM_RESERVATION_STRING"</b>
           <b>HVM/x86</b> <b>only!</b> Specifies information about Reserved Device Memory (RDM), which is necessary to  enable
           robust  device  passthrough.  One example of RDM is reporting through the ACPI Reserved Memory Region
           Reporting (RMRR) structure on the x86 platform.

           <b>RDM_RESERVATION_STRING</b> is a comma separated list of "KEY=VALUE" settings, from the following list:

           <b>strategy=STRING</b>
               Currently there is only one valid type, and that is "host".

               <b>host</b>
                   If set to "host" it means all reserved device memory on this platform should  be  checked  to
                   reserve  regions  in  this  VM's  address space. This global RDM parameter allows the user to
                   specify reserved regions explicitly, and using "host" includes all reserved regions  reported
                   on this platform, which is useful when doing hotplug.

                   By default this isn't set so we don't check all RDMs. Instead, we just check the RDM specific
                   to a given device if we're assigning this kind of a device.

                   Note: this option is not recommended unless you can make sure that no conflicts exist.

                   For  example, you're trying to set "memory = 2800" to allocate memory to one given VM but the
                   platform owns two RDM regions like:

                   Device A [sbdf_A]: RMRR region_A: base_addr ac6d3000 end_address ac6e6fff

                   Device B [sbdf_B]: RMRR region_B: base_addr ad800000 end_address afffffff

                   In this conflict case,

                   #1. If <b>strategy</b> is set to "host", for example:

                   rdm = "strategy=host,policy=strict" or rdm = "strategy=host,policy=relaxed"

                   it means all conflicts will be handled according  to  the  policy  introduced  by  <b>policy</b>  as
                   described below.

                   #2. If <b>strategy</b> is not set at all, but

                   pci = [ 'sbdf_A, rdm_policy=xxxxx' ]

                   it  means only one conflict of region_A will be handled according to the policy introduced by
                   <b>rdm_policy=STRING</b> as described inside <b>pci</b> options.

           <b>policy=STRING</b>
               Specifies how to deal with conflicts when reserving already reserved device memory in  the  guest
               address space.

               <b>strict</b>
                   Specifies  that  in case of an unresolved conflict the VM can't be created, or the associated
                   device can't be attached in the case of hotplug.

               <b>relaxed</b>
                   Specifies that in case of an unresolved conflict the VM is allowed  to  be  created  but  may
                   cause  the  VM  to crash if a pass-through device accesses RDM.  For example, the Windows IGD
                   GFX driver always accesses RDM regions so it leads to a VM crash.

                   Note: this may be overridden by the <b>rdm_policy</b> option in the <b>pci</b> device configuration.

       <b>usbctrl=[</b> <b>"USBCTRL_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>"USBCTRL_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Specifies the USB controllers created for this guest.

           Each <b>USBCTRL_SPEC_STRING</b> is a comma-separated list of "KEY=VALUE" settings, from the following list:

           <b>type=TYPE</b>
               Specifies the usb controller type.

               <b>pv</b>  Specifies a kernel based PVUSB backend.

               <b>qusb</b>
                   Specifies a QEMU based PVUSB backend.

               <b>devicemodel</b>
                   Specifies a USB controller emulated by QEMU.  It will show up as a PCI-device in the guest.

               <b>auto</b>
                   Determines whether a kernel based backend is installed.  If this is the  case,  <b>pv</b>  is  used,
                   otherwise <b>qusb</b> will be used.  For HVM domains <b>devicemodel</b> will be selected.

                   This option is the default.

           <b>version=VERSION</b>
               Specifies  the  usb  controller  version.   Possible  values include 1 (USB1.1), 2 (USB2.0) and 3
               (USB3.0).  Default is 2 (USB2.0).  Value 3 (USB3.0) is available for the <b>devicemodel</b> type only.

           <b>ports=PORTS</b>
               Specifies the total number of ports of the usb controller. The maximum number is 31. The  default
               is  8.  With the type <b>devicemodel</b> the number of ports is more limited: a USB1.1 controller always
               has 2 ports, a USB2.0 controller always has 6 ports and a USB3.0 controller can  have  up  to  15
               ports.

               USB  controller  ids  start  from  0.   In  line  with the USB specification, however, ports on a
               controller start from 1.

               <b>EXAMPLE</b>

                 usbctrl=["version=1,ports=4", "version=2,ports=8"]

                 The first controller is USB1.1 and has:

                 controller id = 0, and ports 1,2,3,4.

                 The second controller is USB2.0 and has:

                 controller id = 1, and ports 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

       <b>usbdev=[</b> <b>"USBDEV_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>"USBDEV_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Specifies the USB devices to be attached to the guest at boot.

           Each <b>USBDEV_SPEC_STRING</b> is a comma-separated list of "KEY=VALUE" settings, from the following list:

           <b>type=hostdev</b>
               Specifies USB device type. Currently only "hostdev" is supported.

           <b>hostbus=busnum</b>
               Specifies busnum of the USB device from the host perspective.

           <b>hostaddr=devnum</b>
               Specifies devnum of the USB device from the host perspective.

           <b>controller=CONTROLLER</b>
               Specifies the USB controller id, to which controller the USB device is attached.

               If no controller is specified, an available controller:port combination will be used.   If  there
               are no available controller:port combinations, a new controller will be created.

           <b>port=PORT</b>
               Specifies  the  USB  port to which the USB device is attached. The <b>port</b> option is valid only when
               the <b>controller</b> option is specified.

       <b>pci=[</b> <b>"PCI_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>"PCI_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Specifies the host PCI devices to passthrough to this guest.  See  <b><a href="../man5/xl-pci-configuration.5.html">xl-pci-configuration</a></b>(5)  for  more
           details.

       <b>pci_permissive=BOOLEAN</b>
           Changes the default value of <b>permissive</b> for all PCI devices passed through to this VM. See <b>permissive</b>
           above.

       <b>pci_msitranslate=BOOLEAN</b>
           Changes  the  default  value  of  <b>msitranslate</b>  for  all  PCI  devices passed through to this VM. See
           <b>msitranslate</b> above.

       <b>pci_seize=BOOLEAN</b>
           Changes the default value of <b>seize</b> for all PCI devices passed through to this VM. See <b>seize</b> above.

       <b>pci_power_mgmt=BOOLEAN</b>
           <b>(HVM</b> <b>only)</b> Changes the default value of <b>power_mgmt</b> for all PCI devices passed through to this VM. See
           <b>power_mgmt</b> above.

       <b>gfx_passthru=BOOLEAN|"STRING"</b>
           Enable graphics device PCI passthrough. This option makes an assigned PCI graphics  card  become  the
           primary  graphics  card in the VM. The QEMU emulated graphics adapter is disabled and the VNC console
           for the VM will not have any graphics output. All graphics output,  including  boot  time  QEMU  BIOS
           messages from the VM, will go to the physical outputs of the passed through physical graphics card.

           The graphics card PCI device to pass through is chosen with the <b>pci</b> option, in exactly the same way a
           normal Xen PCI device passthrough/assignment is done.  Note that <b>gfx_passthru</b> does not do any kind of
           sharing of the GPU, so you can assign the GPU to only one single VM at a time.

           <b>gfx_passthru</b>  also  enables  various  legacy VGA memory ranges, BARs, MMIOs, and ioports to be passed
           through to the VM, since those are required for correct operation of things like VGA BIOS, text mode,
           VBE, etc.

           Enabling the <b>gfx_passthru</b> option also copies the physical graphics  card  video  BIOS  to  the  guest
           memory, and executes the VBIOS in the guest to initialize the graphics card.

           Most  graphics adapters require vendor specific tweaks for properly working graphics passthrough. See
           the                                                                   XenVGAPassthroughTestedAdapters
           &lt;https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/XenVGAPassthroughTestedAdapters&gt;   wiki  page  for  graphics  cards
           currently supported by <b>gfx_passthru</b>.

           <b>gfx_passthru</b> is currently supported both with  the  qemu-xen-traditional  device-model  and  upstream
           qemu-xen device-model.

           When  given as a boolean the <b>gfx_passthru</b> option either disables graphics card passthrough or enables
           autodetection.

           When given as a string the <b>gfx_passthru</b> option describes the type of device to enable. Note that this
           behavior is only supported with the upstream qemu-xen  device-model.  With  qemu-xen-traditional  IGD
           (Intel  Graphics  Device)  is  always  assumed and options other than autodetect or explicit IGD will
           result in an error.

           Currently, valid values for the option are:

           <b>0</b>   Disables graphics device PCI passthrough.

           <b>1</b>, <b>"default"</b>
               Enables graphics device PCI passthrough and autodetects the type of device which is being used.

           <b>"igd"</b>
               Enables graphics device PCI passthrough but forcing the type of device to Intel Graphics Device.

           Note that  some  graphics  cards  (AMD/ATI  cards,  for  example)  do  not  necessarily  require  the
           <b>gfx_passthru</b>  option,  so you can use the normal Xen PCI passthrough to assign the graphics card as a
           secondary graphics card to the VM. The QEMU-emulated graphics card remains the primary graphics card,
           and VNC output is available from the QEMU-emulated primary adapter.

           More  information  about  the  Xen  <b>gfx_passthru</b>  feature  is  available  on  the   XenVGAPassthrough
           &lt;https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/XenVGAPassthrough&gt; wiki page.

       <b>rdm_mem_boundary=MBYTES</b>
           Number of megabytes to set for a boundary when checking for RDM conflicts.

           When  RDM conflicts with RAM, RDM is probably scattered over the whole RAM space. Having multiple RDM
           entries would worsen this and lead to a complicated memory layout. Here we're trying to figure out  a
           simple solution to avoid breaking the existing layout. When a conflict occurs,

               #1. Above a predefined boundary
                   - move lowmem_end below the reserved region to solve the conflict;

               #2. Below a predefined boundary
                   - Check if the policy is strict or relaxed.
                   A "strict" policy leads to a fail in libxl.
                   Note that when both policies are specified on a given region,
                   "strict" is always preferred.
                   The "relaxed" policy issues a warning message and also masks this
                   entry INVALID to indicate we shouldn't expose this entry to
                   hvmloader.

           The default value is 2048.

       <b>dtdev=[</b> <b>"DTDEV_PATH",</b> <b>"DTDEV_PATH",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Specifies  the  host  device tree nodes to passt hrough to this guest. Each DTDEV_PATH is an absolute
           path in the device tree.

       <b>ioports=[</b> <b>"IOPORT_RANGE",</b> <b>"IOPORT_RANGE",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Allow the guest to access specific legacy I/O ports. Each <b>IOPORT_RANGE</b> is given in hexadecimal format
           and may either be a range, e.g. "2f8-2ff" (inclusive), or a single I/O port, e.g. "2f8".

           It is recommended to only use this option for trusted VMs under administrator's control.

       <b>iomem=[</b> <b>"IOMEM_START,NUM_PAGES[@GFN]",</b> <b>"IOMEM_START,NUM_PAGES[@GFN]",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Allow auto-translated domains to access specific hardware I/O memory pages.

           <b>IOMEM_START</b> is a physical page number. <b>NUM_PAGES</b> is the number of pages, beginning  with  <b>START_PAGE</b>,
           to  allow access to. <b>GFN</b> specifies the guest frame number where the mapping will start in the guest's
           address space. If <b>GFN</b> is not specified, the mapping will be performed using <b>IOMEM_START</b> as a start in
           the guest's address space, therefore performing a 1:1 mapping by default.  All of these  values  must
           be given in hexadecimal format.

           Note  that  the  IOMMU  won't  be  updated  with the mappings specified with this option. This option
           therefore should not be used to pass through any IOMMU-protected devices.

           It is recommended to only use this option for trusted VMs under administrator's control.

       <b>irqs=[</b> <b>NUMBER,</b> <b>NUMBER,</b> <b>...]</b>
           Allow a guest to access specific physical IRQs.

           It is recommended to only use this option for trusted VMs under administrator's control.

           If vuart console is enabled then irq 32 is reserved for it. See "vuart="uart"" to know how to  enable
           vuart console.

       <b>max_event_channels=N</b>
           Limit  the  guest to using at most N event channels (PV interrupts).  Guests use hypervisor resources
           for each event channel they use.

           The default of 1023 should be sufficient for typical guests.  The maximum value depends on  what  the
           guest  supports.   Guests  supporting  the  FIFO-based  event channel ABI support up to 131,071 event
           channels.  Other guests are limited to 4095 (64-bit x86 and ARM) or 1023 (32-bit x86).

       <b>vdispl=[</b> <b>"VDISPL_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>"VDISPL_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Specifies the virtual display devices to be provided to the guest.

           Each <b>VDISPL_SPEC_STRING</b> is a comma-separated list of "KEY=VALUE" settings, from the following list:

           "backend=DOMAIN"
               Specifies the backend domain name or id. If not specified Domain-0 is used.

           "be-alloc=BOOLEAN"
               Indicates if backend can be a buffer provider/allocator for this domain. See display protocol for
               details.

           "connectors=CONNECTORS"
               Specifies virtual connectors for the  device  in  following  format  &lt;id&gt;:&lt;W&gt;x&lt;H&gt;;&lt;id&gt;:&lt;W&gt;x&lt;H&gt;...
               where:

               "id"
                   String connector unique id. Space, comma symbols are not allowed.

               "W" Connector width in pixels.

               "H" Connector height in pixels.

               <b>EXAMPLE</b>

                   connectors=id0:1920x1080;id1:800x600;id2:640x480

       <b>dm_restrict=BOOLEAN</b>
           Restrict  the  device  model after startup, to limit the consequencese of security vulnerabilities in
           qemu.

           See docs/features/qemu-depriv.pandoc for more information on Linux  and  QEMU  version  requirements,

       <b>vsnd=[</b> <b>VCARD_SPEC,</b> <b>VCARD_SPEC,</b> <b>...</b> <b>]</b>
           Specifies  the virtual sound cards to be provided to the guest.  Each <b>VCARD_SPEC</b> is a list, which has
           a form of "[VSND_ITEM_SPEC, VSND_ITEM_SPEC, ... ]" (without the quotes).  The virtual sound card  has
           hierarchical  structure.  Every card has a set of PCM devices and streams, each could be individually
           configured.

           <b>VSND_ITEM_SPEC</b> describes individual item parameters.  <b>VSND_ITEM_SPEC</b> is a string of  comma  separated
           item parameters headed by item identifier. Each item parameter is "KEY=VALUE" pair:

               "identifier, param = value, ...".

           Identifier  shall  be  one  of  following values: "CARD", "PCM", "STREAM".  The child item treated as
           belonging to the previously defined parent item.

           All parameters are optional.

           There are group of parameters which are common for all items.  This group can be  defined  at  higher
           level  of  the hierarchy and be fully or partially re-used by the underlying layers. These parameters
           are:

               * number of channels (min/max)

               * supported sample rates

               * supported sample formats

           E.g. one can define these values for the whole card, device or stream.   Every  underlying  layer  in
           turn  can  re-define some or all of them to better fit its needs. For example, card may define number
           of channels to be in [1; 8] range, and some particular stream may be limited to  [1;  2]  only.   The
           rule is that the underlying layer must be a subset of the upper layer range.

           <b>Arm</b>  <b>only.</b>  Set  TEE type for the guest. TEE is a Trusted Execution Environment -- separate secure OS
           found on some platforms. <b>STRING</b> can be one of the:

           <b>none</b>
               "Don't allow the guest to use TEE if present on the platform. This is the default value.

           <b>optee</b>
               Allow a guest to access the host OP-TEE OS. Xen  will  mediate  the  access  to  OP-TEE  and  the
               resource  isolation  will  be  provided directly by OP-TEE. OP-TEE itself may limit the number of
               guests that can concurrently use it. This requires a  virtualization-aware  OP-TEE  for  this  to
               work.

               You             can             refer             to             OP-TEE             documentation

           <b>ffa</b> <b>Arm</b> <b>only.</b> Allow a guest to communicate via FF-A with Secure Partitions (SP), default false.

               Currently  only a small subset of the FF-A specification is supported. Just enough to communicate
               with OP-TEE. In general only direct messaging and sharing memory with one SP. More  advanced  use
               cases where memory might be shared or donated to multiple SPs are not supported.

   <b>Paravirtualised</b> <b>(PV)</b> <b>Guest</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Options</b>
       The following options apply only to Paravirtual (PV) guests.

       <b>bootloader="PROGRAM"</b>
           Run  "PROGRAM"  to  find  the kernel image and ramdisk to use.  Normally "PROGRAM" would be "pygrub",
           which is an emulation of grub/grub2/syslinux. Either <b>kernel</b> or <b>bootloader</b> must be  specified  for  PV
           guests.

       <b>bootloader_args=[</b> <b>"ARG",</b> <b>"ARG",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Append  <b>ARG</b>s  to  the  arguments to the <b>bootloader</b> program. Alternatively if the argument is a simple
           string then it will be split into words at whitespace <b>(this</b> <b>second</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>deprecated)</b>.

       <b>bootloader_restrict=BOOLEAN</b>
           Attempt  to  restrict  the  bootloader  after  startup,  to  limit  the  consequences   of   security
           vulnerabilities due to parsing guest owned image files.

           See  docs/features/qemu-deprivilege.pandoc  for  more  information  on  how to setup the unprivileged
           users.

           Note that running the bootloader in restricted mode also implies using non-interactive mode, and  the
           disk image must be readable by the restricted user.

       <b>bootloader_user=USERNAME</b>
           When  using  bootloader_restrict,  run  the  bootloader  as  this  user.  If not set the default QEMU
           restrict users will be used.

           NOTE: Each domain MUST have a SEPARATE username.

           See docs/features/qemu-deprivilege.pandoc for more information.

       <b>e820_host=BOOLEAN</b>
           Selects whether to expose the host e820 (memory map) to the guest via the  virtual  e820.  When  this
           option  is  false  (0)  the  guest  pseudo-physical address space consists of a single contiguous RAM
           region. When this option is specified the virtual e820 instead reflects the host  e820  and  contains
           the  same  PCI  holes. The total amount of RAM represented by the memory map is always the same, this
           option configures only how it is laid out.

           Exposing the host e820 to the guest gives the guest kernel the opportunity to set aside the  required
           part  of its pseudo-physical address space in order to provide address space to map passedthrough PCI
           devices. It is guest Operating System dependent whether this option is required, specifically  it  is
           required  when  using  a mainline Linux ("pvops") kernel. This option defaults to true (1) if any PCI
           passthrough devices are configured and false (0) otherwise. If you do not configure  any  passthrough
           devices  at domain creation time but expect to hotplug devices later then you should set this option.
           Conversely if your particular guest kernel does not require this behaviour then it is safe  to  allow
           this to be enabled but you may wish to disable it anyway.

   <b>Fully-virtualised</b> <b>(HVM)</b> <b>Guest</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Options</b>
       The following options apply only to Fully-virtualised (HVM) guests.

       <u>Boot</u> <u>Device</u>

       <b>boot="STRING"</b>
           Specifies the emulated virtual device to boot from.

           Possible values are:

           <b>c</b>   Hard disk.

           <b>d</b>   CD-ROM.

           <b>n</b>   Network / PXE.

           <b>Note:</b>  multiple  options can be given and will be attempted in the order they are given, e.g. to boot
           from CD-ROM but fall back to the hard disk you can specify it as <b>dc</b>.

           The default is <b>cd</b>, meaning try booting from the hard disk first, but fall back to the CD-ROM.

       <u>Emulated</u> <u>disk</u> <u>controller</u> <u>type</u>

       <b>hdtype=STRING</b>
           Specifies the hard disk type.

           Possible values are:

           <b>ide</b> If thise mode is specified <b>xl</b> adds an emulated IDE controller, which is suitable even  for  older
               operation systems.

           <b>ahci</b>
               If this mode is specified, <b>xl</b> adds an ich9 disk controller in AHCI mode and uses it with upstream
               QEMU  to emulate disks instead of IDE. It decreases boot time but may not be supported by default
               in older operating systems, e.g.  Windows XP.

           The default is <b>ide</b>.

       <u>Paging</u>

       The following options control the mechanisms used to virtualise guest memory.  The defaults are  selected
       to give the best results for the common cases so you should normally leave these options unspecified.

       <b>hap=BOOLEAN</b>
           Turns "hardware assisted paging" (the use of the hardware nested page table feature) on or off.  This
           feature  is  called  EPT  (Extended  Page Tables) by Intel and NPT (Nested Page Tables) or RVI (Rapid
           Virtualisation Indexing) by AMD. If turned off, Xen will run the guest in "shadow  page  table"  mode
           where  the  guest's  page  table updates and/or TLB flushes etc. will be emulated.  Use of HAP is the
           default when available.

       <b>oos=BOOLEAN</b>
           Turns "out of sync pagetables" on or off.  When running in shadow page table mode, the  guest's  page
           table  updates may be deferred as specified in the Intel/AMD architecture manuals.  However, this may
           expose unexpected bugs in the guest, or find bugs in Xen, so it is possible to disable this  feature.
           Use of out of sync page tables, when Xen thinks it appropriate, is the default.

       <b>shadow_memory=MBYTES</b>
           Number  of  megabytes to set aside for shadowing guest pagetable pages (effectively acting as a cache
           of translated pages) or to use for HAP state. By default this is 1MB per guest vCPU plus 8KB  per  MB
           of  guest  RAM.  You  should  not  normally  need to adjust this value. However, if you are not using
           hardware assisted paging (i.e. you are using shadow mode) and your guest workload consists of a  very
           large number of similar processes then increasing this value may improve performance.

       <u>Processor</u> <u>and</u> <u>Platform</u> <u>Features</u>

       The  following  options  allow various processor and platform level features to be hidden or exposed from
       the guest's point of view. This can be useful when  running  older  guest  Operating  Systems  which  may
       misbehave  when  faced  with  more  modern features. In general, you should accept the defaults for these
       options wherever possible.

       <b>bios="STRING"</b>
           Select the virtual firmware that is exposed to the guest.  By default, a guess is made based  on  the
           device model, but sometimes it may be useful to request a different one, like UEFI.

           <b>rombios</b>
               Loads   ROMBIOS,   a   16-bit   x86   compatible   BIOS.   This   is   used   by   default   when
               <b>device_model_version=qemu-xen-traditional</b>.  This  is  the  only  BIOS   option   supported   when
               <b>device_model_version=qemu-xen-traditional</b>. This is the BIOS used by all previous Xen versions.

           <b>seabios</b>
               Loads   SeaBIOS,   a   16-bit   x86   compatible   BIOS.   This   is   used   by   default   with
               device_model_version=qemu-xen.

           <b>ovmf</b>
               Loads    OVMF,    a    standard    UEFI    firmware    by    Tianocore     project.      Requires
               device_model_version=qemu-xen.

       <b>bios_path_override="PATH"</b>
           Override  the path to the blob to be used as BIOS. The blob provided here MUST be consistent with the
           <b>bios=</b> which you have specified. You should not normally need to specify this option.

           This    option    does     not     have     any     effect     if     using     <b>bios="rombios"</b>     or
           <b>device_model_version="qemu-xen-traditional"</b>.

       <b>pae=BOOLEAN</b>
           Hide  or  expose the IA32 Physical Address Extensions. These extensions make it possible for a 32 bit
           guest Operating System to access more than 4GB of RAM. Enabling PAE also enabled other features  such
           as  NX.  PAE  is  required if you wish to run a 64-bit guest Operating System. In general, you should
           leave this enabled and allow the guest Operating System to choose whether or not  to  use  PAE.  (X86
           only)

       <b>acpi=BOOLEAN</b>
           Expose  ACPI  (Advanced  Configuration  and  Power Interface) tables from the virtual firmware to the
           guest Operating System. ACPI is required by most modern  guest  Operating  Systems.  This  option  is
           enabled  by  default and usually you should omit it. However, it may be necessary to disable ACPI for
           compatibility with some guest Operating Systems.  This option is true for x86 while  it's  false  for
           ARM by default.

       <b>acpi_s3=BOOLEAN</b>
           Include the S3 (suspend-to-ram) power state in the virtual firmware ACPI table. True (1) by default.

       <b>acpi_s4=BOOLEAN</b>
           Include S4 (suspend-to-disk) power state in the virtual firmware ACPI table. True (1) by default.

       <b>acpi_laptop_slate=BOOLEAN</b>
           Include  the Windows laptop/slate mode switch device in the virtual firmware ACPI table. False (0) by
           default.

       <b>apic=BOOLEAN</b>
           <b>(x86</b> <b>only)</b> Include information regarding APIC (Advanced Programmable  Interrupt  Controller)  in  the
           firmware/BIOS  tables  on  a single processor guest. This causes the MP (multiprocessor) and PIR (PCI
           Interrupt Routing) tables to be exported by the virtual firmware. This option  has  no  effect  on  a
           guest  with multiple virtual CPUs as they must always include these tables. This option is enabled by
           default and you should usually omit it but it may be necessary to disable these firmware tables  when
           using  certain  older  guest Operating Systems. These tables have been superseded by newer constructs
           within the ACPI tables.

       <b>nx=BOOLEAN</b>
           <b>(x86</b> <b>only)</b> Hides or exposes the No-eXecute capability. This allows a guest Operating  System  to  map
           pages  in  such  a way that they cannot be executed which can enhance security. This options requires
           that PAE also be enabled.

       <b>hpet=BOOLEAN</b>
           <b>(x86</b> <b>only)</b> Enables or disables HPET (High Precision Event Timer). This option is enabled  by  default
           and  you  should  usually  omit  it.   It  may  be  necessary to disable the HPET in order to improve
           compatibility with guest Operating Systems.

       <b>altp2m="MODE"</b>
           <b>(x86</b> <b>only)</b> Specifies the access mode to the alternate-p2m capability.  Alternate-p2m allows  a  guest
           to manage multiple p2m guest physical "memory views" (as opposed to a single p2m).  You may want this
           option  if you want to access-control/isolate access to specific guest physical memory pages accessed
           by the guest, e.g. for domain memory introspection or for isolation/access-control of memory  between
           components within a single guest domain. This option is disabled by default.

           The valid values are as follows:

           <b>disabled</b>
               Altp2m is disabled for the domain (default).

           <b>mixed</b>
               The  mixed  mode  allows  access  to the altp2m interface for both in-guest and external tools as
               well.

           <b>external</b>
               Enables access to the alternate-p2m capability by external privileged tools.

           <b>limited</b>
               Enables limited access to the alternate-p2m capability, ie.  giving  the  guest  access  only  to
               enable/disable the VMFUNC and #VE features.

       <b>altp2mhvm=BOOLEAN</b>
           Enables  or  disables  HVM guest access to alternate-p2m capability.  Alternate-p2m allows a guest to
           manage multiple p2m guest physical "memory views" (as opposed  to  a  single  p2m).  This  option  is
           disabled  by  default  and is available only to HVM domains.  You may want this option if you want to
           access-control/isolate access to specific guest physical memory pages accessed by the guest, e.g. for
           HVM domain memory introspection or for isolation/access-control of memory between components within a
           single guest HVM domain. <b>This</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>deprecated,</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>option</b> <b>"altp2m"</b> <b>instead.</b>

           <b>Note</b>: While the option "altp2mhvm" is deprecated, legacy applications for x86 systems  will  continue
           to work using it.

       <b>nestedhvm=BOOLEAN</b>
           Enable or disables guest access to hardware virtualisation features, e.g. it allows a guest Operating
           System  to  also  function  as  a  hypervisor.  You  may  want this option if you want to run another
           hypervisor (including another copy of Xen) within a Xen guest or to support a guest Operating  System
           which  uses  hardware  virtualisation  extensions  (e.g. Windows XP compatibility mode on more modern
           Windows OS).  This option is disabled by default.

       <b>cpuid="LIBXL_STRING"</b> or <b>cpuid=[</b> <b>"XEND_STRING",</b> <b>"XEND_STRING"</b> <b>]</b>
           Configure the value returned when a guest executes the CPUID instruction.   Two  versions  of  config
           syntax are recognized: libxl and xend.

           Both formats use a common notation for specifying a single feature bit.  Possible values are:
             '1' -&gt; force the corresponding bit to 1
             '0' -&gt; force to 0
             'x' -&gt; Get a safe value (pass through and mask with the default policy)
             'k' -&gt; pass through the host bit value (at boot only - value preserved on migrate)
             's' -&gt; legacy alias for 'k'

           <b>Libxl</b> <b>format</b>:

               The  libxl  format  is  a  single  string, starting with the word "host", and followed by a comma
               separated list of key=value pairs.  A few keys take a numerical value, all others take  a  single
               character which describes what to do with the feature bit.  e.g.:

                   cpuid="host,tm=0,sse3=0"

               List of keys taking a value:

                   apicidsize  brandid  clflush  family localapicid maxleaf maxhvleaf model nc proccount procpkg
                   stepping

               List of keys taking a character can be found in the public header  file  arch-x86/cpufeatureset.h
               &lt;https://xenbits.xen.org/docs/unstable/hypercall/x86_64/include,public,arch-
               x86,cpufeatureset.h.html&gt;

               The  feature  names  described in "cpufeatureset.h" should be specified in all lowercase letters,
               and with underscores converted to hyphens.  For example in order to reference  feature  "LAHF_LM"
               the string "lahf-lm" should be used.

               Note  that "clflush" is described as an option that takes a value, and that takes precedence over
               the "clflush" flag in "cpufeatureset.h".  The feature flag must be referenced as "clfsh".

           <b>Xend</b> <b>format</b>:

               Xend format consists of an array of one or more strings  of  the  form  "leaf:reg=bitstring,...".
               e.g. (matching the libxl example above):

                   cpuid=["1:ecx=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx0,edx=xx0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", ...]

               "leaf" is an integer, either decimal or hex with a "0x" prefix.  e.g. to specify something in the
               AMD feature leaves, use "0x80000001:ecx=...".

               Some  leaves  have  subleaves  which  can  be  specified  as  "leaf,subleaf".  e.g. for the Intel
               structured feature leaf, use "7,0:ebx=..."

               The bitstring represents all bits in the register, its length must be 32 chars.  Each  successive
               character represent a lesser-significant bit.

           Note:  when specifying <b>cpuid</b> for hypervisor leaves (0x4000xxxx major group) only the lowest 8 bits of
           leaf's 0x4000xx00 EAX register are processed, the rest are ignored  (these  8  bits  signify  maximum
           number of hypervisor leaves).

           More  info  about  the  CPUID  instruction  can  be found in the processor manuals, and on Wikipedia:
           &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPUID&gt;

       <b>acpi_firmware="STRING"</b>
           Specifies a path to a file that contains extra ACPI firmware tables to pass into a  guest.  The  file
           can  contain several tables in their binary AML form concatenated together. Each table self describes
           its length so no additional information is needed. These tables will be added to the ACPI  table  set
           in  the  guest.  Note  that  existing  tables cannot be overridden by this feature. For example, this
           cannot be used to override tables like DSDT, FADT, etc.

       <b>smbios_firmware="STRING"</b>
           Specifies a path to a file that contains extra SMBIOS firmware structures to pass into a  guest.  The
           file  can  contain a set of DMTF predefined structures which will override the internal defaults. Not
           all predefined structures can be overridden, only the following types: 0, 1, 2, 3, 11,  22,  39.  The
           file  can  also contain any number of vendor defined SMBIOS structures (type 128 - 255). Since SMBIOS
           structures do not present their overall size, each entry in the  file  must  be  preceded  by  a  32b
           integer indicating the size of the following structure.

       <b>smbios=[</b> <b>"SMBIOS_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>"SMBIOS_SPEC_STRING",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Specifies  the  SMBIOS values to be provided to the guest.  These set or override specific entries in
           the tables provided to the guest.

           Each <b>SMBIOS_SPEC_STRING</b> is a "KEY=VALUE" string from the following list:

           <b>bios_vendor=STRING</b>
           <b>bios_version=STRING</b>
           <b>system_manufacturer=STRING</b>
           <b>system_product_name=STRING</b>
           <b>system_version=STRING</b>
           <b>system_serial_number=STRING</b>
           <b>baseboard_manufacturer=STRING</b>
           <b>baseboard_product_name=STRING</b>
           <b>baseboard_version=STRING</b>
           <b>baseboard_serial_number=STRING</b>
           <b>baseboard_asset_tag=STRING</b>
           <b>baseboard_location_in_chassis=STRING</b>
           <b>enclosure_manufacturer=STRING</b>
           <b>enclosure_serial_number=STRING</b>
           <b>enclosure_asset_tag=STRING</b>
           <b>battery_manufacturer=STRING</b>
           <b>battery_device_name=STRING</b>
           <b>oem=STRING</b>
               oem= can be specified up to 99 times.

       <b>ms_vm_genid="OPTION"</b>
           Provide a VM generation ID to the guest.

           The VM generation ID is a 128-bit random number that a guest may use to determine if  the  guest  has
           been restored from an earlier snapshot or cloned.

           This is required for Microsoft Windows Server 2012 (and later) domain controllers.

           Valid options are:

           <b>generate</b>
               Generate a random VM generation ID every time the domain is created or restored.

           <b>none</b>
               Do not provide a VM generation ID.

           See        also        "Virtual        Machine        Generation        ID"       by       Microsoft:

       <u>Guest</u> <u>Virtual</u> <u>Time</u> <u>Controls</u>

       <b>tsc_mode="MODE"</b>
           <b>(x86</b> <b>only)</b> Specifies how the TSC (Time Stamp Counter) should be provided  to  the  guest.  <b>Specifying</b>
           <b>this</b> <b>option</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> <b>deprecated.</b>

           Options are:

           <b>default</b>
               Guest  rdtsc/p  is  executed  natively when monotonicity can be guaranteed and emulated otherwise
               (with frequency scaled if necessary).

               If a HVM container in <b>default</b> TSC mode is created on a host that provides constant host TSC,  its
               guest  TSC  frequency  will be the same as the host. If it is later migrated to another host that
               provide constant host TSC and supports Intel VMX TSC scaling/AMD SVM TSC  ratio,  its  guest  TSC
               frequency  will  be  the  same  before  and  after  migration, and guest rdtsc/p will be executed
               natively after migration as well

           <b>always_emulate</b>
               Guest rdtsc/p is always emulated and the virtual TSC will appear to increment (kernel  and  user)
               at  a  fixed  1GHz  rate,  regardless  of  the  pCPU HZ rate or power state. Although there is an
               overhead associated with emulation, this will NOT affect underlying CPU performance.

           <b>native</b>
               Guest rdtsc/p is always executed natively (no monotonicity/frequency guarantees).  Guest  rdtsc/p
               is emulated at native frequency if unsupported by h/w, else executed natively.

           <b>native_paravirt</b>
               This mode has been removed.

           Please see <b><a href="../man7/xen-tscmode.7.html">xen-tscmode</a>(7)</b> for more information on this option.

       <b>localtime=BOOLEAN</b>
           Set the real time clock to local time or to UTC. False (0) by default, i.e. set to UTC.

       <b>rtc_timeoffset=SECONDS</b>
           Set the real time clock offset in seconds. No offset (0) by default.

       <b>vpt_align=BOOLEAN</b>
           Specifies  that  periodic  Virtual  Platform  Timers  should  be  aligned to reduce guest interrupts.
           Enabling this option can reduce power  consumption,  especially  when  a  guest  uses  a  high  timer
           interrupt frequency (HZ) values. The default is true (1).

       <b>timer_mode="MODE"</b>
           Specifies the mode for Virtual Timers. The valid values are as follows:

           <b>delay_for_missed_ticks</b>
               Delay  for  missed  ticks.  Do  not  advance  a  vCPU's time beyond the correct delivery time for
               interrupts that have been missed due to preemption. Deliver missed interrupts when  the  vCPU  is
               rescheduled and advance the vCPU's virtual time stepwise for each one.

           <b>no_delay_for_missed_ticks</b>
               No  delay  for  missed  ticks.  As  above, missed interrupts are delivered, but guest time always
               tracks wallclock (i.e., real) time while doing so. This is the default.

           <b>no_missed_ticks_pending</b>
               No missed interrupts are held pending. Instead, to ensure ticks are delivered  at  some  non-zero
               rate,  if  we  detect  missed  ticks  then the internal tick alarm is not disabled if the vCPU is
               preempted during the next tick period.

           <b>one_missed_tick_pending</b>
               One missed tick pending. Missed interrupts are collapsed together  and  delivered  as  one  'late
               tick'.  Guest time always tracks wallclock (i.e., real) time.

       <u>Memory</u> <u>layout</u>

       <b>mmio_hole=MBYTES</b>
           Specifies the size the MMIO hole below 4GiB will be.  Only valid for <b>device_model_version="qemu-xen"</b>.

           Cannot be smaller than 256. Cannot be larger than 3840.

           Known good large value is 3072.

       <u>Support</u> <u>for</u> <u>Paravirtualisation</u> <u>of</u> <u>HVM</u> <u>Guests</u>

       The  following  options  allow  Paravirtualised  features  (such  as  devices) to be exposed to the guest
       Operating System in an HVM guest.  Utilising these features requires  specific  guest  support  but  when
       available they will result in improved performance.

       <b>xen_platform_pci=BOOLEAN</b>
           Enable  or  disable the Xen platform PCI device.  The presence of this virtual device enables a guest
           Operating System (subject to the availability of suitable drivers) to make use of  paravirtualisation
           features  such  as  disk  and network devices etc. Enabling these drivers improves performance and is
           strongly recommended when available. PV drivers are available for various Operating Systems including
           HVM Linux (out-of-the-box) and Microsoft Windows &lt;https://xenproject.org/windows-pv-drivers/&gt;.

           Setting <b>xen_platform_pci=0</b> with the default device_model "qemu-xen" requires at least QEMU 1.6.

       <b>viridian=[</b> <b>"GROUP",</b> <b>"GROUP",</b> <b>...]</b> or <b>viridian=BOOLEAN</b>
           The groups of Microsoft Hyper-V (AKA viridian) compatible enlightenments exposed to  the  guest.  The
           following groups of enlightenments may be specified:

           <b>base</b>
               This  group  incorporates  the Hypercall MSRs, Virtual processor index MSR, and APIC access MSRs.
               These enlightenments can improve performance of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 onwards and
               setting this option for such guests is strongly recommended.  This group is also a  pre-requisite
               for all others. If it is disabled then it is an error to attempt to enable any other group.

           <b>freq</b>
               This  group  incorporates  the  TSC  and  APIC  frequency  MSRs. These enlightenments can improve
               performance of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 onwards.

           <b>time_ref_count</b>
               This group incorporates Partition Time Reference Counter  MSR.  This  enlightenment  can  improve
               performance of Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 onwards.

           <b>reference_tsc</b>
               This set incorporates the Partition Reference TSC MSR. This enlightenment can improve performance
               of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 onwards.

           <b>hcall_remote_tlb_flush</b>
               This  set incorporates use of hypercalls for remote TLB flushing.  This enlightenment may improve
               performance of Windows guests running on hosts with higher levels of (physical) CPU contention.

           <b>apic_assist</b>
               This set incorporates use of the APIC  assist  page  to  avoid  EOI  of  the  local  APIC.   This
               enlightenment  may  improve  performance of guests that make use of per-vCPU event channel upcall
               vectors.  Note that this enlightenment will have no effect if the guest  is  using  APICv  posted
               interrupts.

           <b>crash_ctl</b>
               This group incorporates the crash control MSRs. These enlightenments allow Windows to write crash
               information such that it can be logged by Xen.

           <b>stimer</b>
               This  set  incorporates  the SynIC and synthetic timer MSRs. Windows will use synthetic timers in
               preference to emulated HPET for a source of ticks and hence enabling this group will ensure  that
               ticks   will   be   consistent  with  use  of  an  enlightened  time  source  (<b>time_ref_count</b>  or
               <b>reference_tsc</b>).

           <b>hcall_ipi</b>
               This set incorporates use of a hypercall for interprocessor interrupts.  This  enlightenment  may
               improve performance of Windows guests with multiple virtual CPUs.

           <b>ex_processor_masks</b>
               This  set  enables new hypercall variants taking a variably-sized sparse <b>Virtual</b> <b>Processor</b> <b>Set</b> as
               an argument, rather than a simple 64-bit mask. Hence this enlightenment  must  be  specified  for
               guests with more than 64 vCPUs if <b>hcall_remote_tlb_flush</b> and/or <b>hcall_ipi</b> are also specified.

           <b>no_vp_limit</b>
               This  group when set indicates to a guest that the hypervisor does not explicitly have any limits
               on the number of Virtual processors a guest is allowed to bring up. It is strongly recommended to
               keep this enabled for guests with more than 64 vCPUs.

           <b>cpu_hotplug</b>
               This set enables dynamic changes to  Virtual  processor  states  in  Windows  guests  effectively
               allowing vCPU hotplug.

           <b>defaults</b>
               This  is  a  special  value  that enables the default set of groups, which is currently the <b>base</b>,
               <b>freq</b>, <b>time_ref_count</b>, <b>apic_assist</b>, <b>crash_ctl</b>, <b>stimer</b>, <b>no_vp_limit</b> and <b>cpu_hotplug</b> groups.

           <b>all</b> This is a special value that enables all available groups.

           Groups can be disabled by prefixing the name with '!'. So, for example, to enable all  groups  except
           <b>freq</b>, specify:

               <b>viridian=[</b> <b>"all",</b> <b>"!freq"</b> <b>]</b>

           For  details  of  the  enlightenments  see  the  latest  version  of Microsoft's Hypervisor Top-Level
           Functional Specification.

           The enlightenments should be harmless for other versions of Windows (although they will not give  any
           benefit)  and the majority of other non-Windows OSes.  However it is known that they are incompatible
           with some other Operating Systems and in some circumstance can prevent Xen's  own  paravirtualisation
           interfaces for HVM guests from being used.

           The  viridian  option  can be specified as a boolean. A value of true (1) is equivalent to the list [
           "defaults" ], and a value of false (0) is equivalent to an empty list.

       <b>hvm_pirq=BOOLEAN</b>
           Select whether the guest is allowed to route interrupts  from  devices  (either  emulated  or  passed
           through) over event channels.

           This option is disabled by default.

       <u>Emulated</u> <u>VGA</u> <u>Graphics</u> <u>Device</u>

       The following options control the features of the emulated graphics device.  Many of these options behave
       similarly  to the equivalent key in the <b>VFB_SPEC_STRING</b> for configuring virtual frame buffer devices (see
       above).

       <b>videoram=MBYTES</b>
           Sets the amount of RAM which the  emulated  video  card  will  contain,  which  in  turn  limits  the
           resolutions and bit depths which will be available.

           When  using the qemu-xen-traditional device-model, the default as well as minimum amount of video RAM
           for stdvga is 8 MB, which is sufficient for e.g.  1600x1200  at  32bpp.  For  the  upstream  qemu-xen
           device-model, the default and minimum is 16 MB.

           When  using  the  emulated  Cirrus  graphics card (<b>vga="cirrus"</b>) and the qemu-xen-traditional device-
           model, the amount of video RAM is fixed at 4 MB, which is sufficient for 1024x768 at 32 bpp. For  the
           upstream qemu-xen device-model, the default and minimum is 8 MB.

           For  QXL  vga,  both the default and minimal are 128MB.  If <b>videoram</b> is set less than 128MB, an error
           will be triggered.

       <b>stdvga=BOOLEAN</b>
           Specifies a standard VGA card with VBE (VESA BIOS Extensions) as the  emulated  graphics  device.  If
           your  guest  supports VBE 2.0 or later (e.g. Windows XP onwards) then you should enable this.  stdvga
           supports more video ram and bigger resolutions than Cirrus.  The default is false (0) which means  to
           emulate a Cirrus Logic GD5446 VGA card.  <b>This</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>deprecated,</b> <b>use</b> <b>vga="stdvga"</b> <b>instead</b>.

       <b>vga="STRING"</b>
           Selects the emulated video card.  Options are: <b>none</b>, <b>stdvga</b>, <b>cirrus</b> and <b>qxl</b>.  The default is <b>cirrus</b>.

           In general, QXL should work with the Spice remote display protocol for acceleration, and a QXL driver
           is necessary in the guest in that case.  QXL can also work with the VNC protocol, but it will be like
           a standard VGA card without acceleration.

       <b>vnc=BOOLEAN</b>
           Allow  access to the display via the VNC protocol.  This enables the other VNC-related settings.  The
           default is (1) enabled.

       <b>vnclisten="ADDRESS[:DISPLAYNUM]"</b>
           Specifies the IP address and, optionally, the VNC display number to use.

       <b>vncdisplay=DISPLAYNUM</b>
           Specifies the VNC display number to use. The actual TCP port number will be DISPLAYNUM+5900.

       <b>vncunused=BOOLEAN</b>
           Requests that the VNC display setup searches for a free TCP port to use.  The actual display used can
           be accessed with <b>xl</b> <b>vncviewer</b>.

       <b>vncpasswd="PASSWORD"</b>
           Specifies the password for the VNC server. If the password is set to an empty string,  authentication
           on the VNC server will be disabled allowing any user to connect.

       <b>keymap="LANG"</b>
           Configure  the  keymap to use for the keyboard associated with this display. If the input method does
           not easily support raw keycodes (e.g. this is often the case when using VNC) then this allows  us  to
           correctly  map the input keys into keycodes seen by the guest. The specific values which are accepted
           are defined by the version of the device-model which you are using. See <b>Keymaps</b> below or consult  the
           <b><a href="../man1/qemu.1.html">qemu</a>(1)</b> manpage. The default is <b>en-us</b>.

       <b>sdl=BOOLEAN</b>
           Specifies  that the display should be presented via an X window (using Simple DirectMedia Layer). The
           default is (0) not enabled.

       <b>opengl=BOOLEAN</b>
           Enable   OpenGL   acceleration   of    the    SDL    display.    Only    effects    machines    using
           <b>device_model_version="qemu-xen-traditional"</b>  and  only  if  the device-model was compiled with OpenGL
           support. Default is (0) false.

       <b>nographic=BOOLEAN</b>
           Enable or disable the virtual graphics device.  The default is to provide a VGA graphics  device  but
           this option can be used to disable it.

       <u>Spice</u> <u>Graphics</u> <u>Support</u>

       The following options control the features of SPICE.

       <b>spice=BOOLEAN</b>
           Allow access to the display via the SPICE protocol.  This enables the other SPICE-related settings.

       <b>spicehost="ADDRESS"</b>
           Specifies the interface address to listen on if given, otherwise any interface.

       <b>spiceport=NUMBER</b>
           Specifies the port to listen on by the SPICE server if SPICE is enabled.

       <b>spicetls_port=NUMBER</b>
           Specifies  the  secure  port  to  listen  on by the SPICE server if SPICE is enabled. At least one of
           <b>spiceport</b> or <b>spicetls_port</b> must be given if SPICE is enabled.

           <b>Note:</b> the options depending on <b>spicetls_port</b> have not been supported.

       <b>spicedisable_ticketing=BOOLEAN</b>
           Enable clients to connect without specifying a password. When disabled, <b>spicepasswd</b> must be set.  The
           default is (0) false.

       <b>spicepasswd="PASSWORD"</b>
           Specify the password which is used by clients for establishing a connection.

       <b>spiceagent_mouse=BOOLEAN</b>
           Whether SPICE agent is used for client mouse mode. The default is (1) true.

       <b>spicevdagent=BOOLEAN</b>
           Enables  the  SPICE vdagent. The SPICE vdagent is an optional component for enhancing user experience
           and performing guest-oriented management tasks. Its features include: client mouse mode (no  need  to
           grab  the  mouse  by  the  client, no mouse lag), automatic adjustment of screen resolution, copy and
           paste (text and image) between the client and  the  guest.  It  also  requires  the  vdagent  service
           installed on the guest OS to work.  The default is (0) disabled.

       <b>spice_clipboard_sharing=BOOLEAN</b>
           Enables  SPICE  clipboard sharing (copy/paste). It requires that <b>spicevdagent</b> is enabled. The default
           is (0) false.

       <b>spiceusbredirection=NUMBER</b>
           Enables SPICE USB redirection. Creates a NUMBER of USB redirection channels for redirecting up  to  4
           USB  devices  from  the  SPICE client to the guest's QEMU.  It requires an USB controller and, if not
           defined, it will automatically add an USB2.0 controller. The default is (0) disabled.

       <b>spice_image_compression="COMPRESSION"</b>
           Specifies what image compression is to be used by SPICE (if given), otherwise the QEMU  default  will
           be used. Please see the documentation of your QEMU version for more details.

           Available options are: <b>auto_glz,</b> <b>auto_lz,</b> <b>quic,</b> <b>glz,</b> <b>lz,</b> <b>off</b>.

       <b>spice_streaming_video="VIDEO"</b>
           Specifies  what streaming video setting is to be used by SPICE (if given), otherwise the QEMU default
           will be used.

           Available options are: <b>filter,</b> <b>all,</b> <b>off</b>.

       <u>Miscellaneous</u> <u>Emulated</u> <u>Hardware</u>

       <b>serial=[</b> <b>"DEVICE",</b> <b>"DEVICE",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Redirect virtual serial ports to <b>DEVICE</b>s. Please see the <b>-serial</b> option in the  <b><a href="../man1/qemu.1.html">qemu</a>(1)</b>  manpage  for
           details of the valid <b>DEVICE</b> options. Default is <b>vc</b> when in graphical mode and <b>stdio</b> if <b>nographic=1</b> is
           used.

           The form serial=DEVICE is also accepted for backwards compatibility.

       <b>soundhw="DEVICE"</b>
           Select the virtual sound card to expose to the guest. The valid devices are <b>hda</b>, <b>ac97</b>, <b>es1370</b>, <b>adlib</b>,
           <b>cs4231a</b>,  <b>gus</b>,  <b>sb16</b>  if there are available with the device model QEMU. The default is not to export
           any sound device.

       <b>vkb_device=BOOLEAN</b>
           Specifies that the HVM guest gets a vkdb. The default is true (1).

           This option is only used when <b>vkb=[]</b> is unset.

       <b>usb=BOOLEAN</b>
           Enables or disables an emulated USB bus in the guest.

       <b>usbversion=NUMBER</b>
           Specifies the type of an emulated USB bus in the guest, values 1 for USB1.1, 2 for USB2.0 and  3  for
           USB3.0.  It  is  available only with an upstream QEMU.  Due to implementation limitations this is not
           compatible with the <b>usb</b> and <b>usbdevice</b> parameters.  Default is (0) no USB controller defined.

       <b>usbdevice=[</b> <b>"DEVICE",</b> <b>"DEVICE",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Adds <b>DEVICE</b>s to the emulated USB bus. The USB bus must also be enabled using <b>usb=1</b>. The  most  common
           use  for  this option is <b>usbdevice=['tablet']</b> which adds a pointer device using absolute coordinates.
           Such devices function better than relative coordinate devices (such as a standard mouse)  since  many
           methods  of  exporting  guest  graphics  (such  as  VNC)  work better in this mode. Note that this is
           independent of the actual pointer device you are using on the host/client side.

           Host devices can also be passed through in this way, by specifying host:USBID, where USBID is of  the
           form xxxx:yyyy.  The USBID can typically be found by using <b><a href="../man1/lsusb.1.html">lsusb</a>(1)</b> or <b><a href="../man1/usb-devices.1.html">usb-devices</a>(1)</b>.

           If  you  wish  to  use  the "host:bus.addr" format, remove any leading '0' from the bus and addr. For
           example, for the USB device on bus 008 dev 002, you should write "host:8.2".

           The form usbdevice=DEVICE is also accepted for backwards compatibility.

           More valid options can be found in the "usbdevice" section of the QEMU documentation.

       <b>vendor_device="VENDOR_DEVICE"</b>
           Selects which variant of the QEMU xen-pvdevice should be used for this guest. Valid values are:

           <b>none</b>
               The xen-pvdevice should be omitted. This is the default.

           <b>xenserver</b>
               The xenserver variant of the xen-pvdevice (device-id=C000) will be specified, enabling the use of
               XenServer PV drivers in the guest.

           This     parameter     only     takes     effect     when     device_model_version=qemu-xen.      See
           <b><a href="../man7/xen-pci-device-reservations.7.html">xen-pci-device-reservations</a>(7)</b> for more information.

   <b>PVH</b> <b>Guest</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>nestedhvm=BOOLEAN</b>
           Enable or disables guest access to hardware virtualisation features, e.g. it allows a guest Operating
           System  to  also  function  as  a  hypervisor.   You  may want this option if you want to run another
           hypervisor (including another copy of Xen) within a Xen guest or to support a guest Operating  System
           which  uses  hardware  virtualisation  extensions  (e.g. Windows XP compatibility mode on more modern
           Windows OS).

           This option is disabled by default.

       <b>bootloader="PROGRAM"</b>
           Run "PROGRAM" to find the kernel image and ramdisk to use.  Normally  "PROGRAM"  would  be  "pygrub",
           which  is  an  emulation of grub/grub2/syslinux. Either <b>kernel</b> or <b>bootloader</b> must be specified for PV
           guests.

       <b>bootloader_args=[</b> <b>"ARG",</b> <b>"ARG",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Append <b>ARG</b>s to the arguments to the <b>bootloader</b> program. Alternatively if the  argument  is  a  simple
           string then it will be split into words at whitespace <b>(this</b> <b>second</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>deprecated)</b>.

       <b>bootloader_restrict=BOOLEAN</b>
           Attempt   to   restrict  the  bootloader  after  startup,  to  limit  the  consequences  of  security
           vulnerabilities due to parsing guest owned image files.

           See docs/features/qemu-deprivilege.pandoc for more information  on  how  to  setup  the  unprivileged
           users.

           Note  that running the bootloader in restricted mode also implies using non-interactive mode, and the
           disk image must be readable by the restricted user.

       <b>bootloader_user=USERNAME</b>
           When using bootloader_restrict, run the bootloader as this user.

           NOTE: Each domain MUST have a SEPARATE username.

           See docs/features/qemu-deprivilege.pandoc for more information.

       <b>timer_mode="MODE"</b>
           Specifies the mode for Virtual Timers. The valid values are as follows:

           <b>delay_for_missed_ticks</b>
               Delay for missed ticks. Do not advance a  vCPU's  time  beyond  the  correct  delivery  time  for
               interrupts  that  have  been missed due to preemption. Deliver missed interrupts when the vCPU is
               rescheduled and advance the vCPU's virtual time stepwise for each one.

           <b>no_delay_for_missed_ticks</b>
               No delay for missed ticks. As above, missed interrupts  are  delivered,  but  guest  time  always
               tracks wallclock (i.e., real) time while doing so. This is the default.

           <b>no_missed_ticks_pending</b>
               No  missed  interrupts  are held pending. Instead, to ensure ticks are delivered at some non-zero
               rate, if we detect missed ticks then the internal tick alarm is  not  disabled  if  the  vCPU  is
               preempted during the next tick period.

           <b>one_missed_tick_pending</b>
               One  missed  tick  pending.  Missed  interrupts are collapsed together and delivered as one 'late
               tick'.  Guest time always tracks wallclock (i.e., real) time.

       <u>Paging</u>

       The following options control the mechanisms used to virtualise guest memory.  The defaults are  selected
       to give the best results for the common cases so you should normally leave these options unspecified.

       <b>hap=BOOLEAN</b>
           Turns "hardware assisted paging" (the use of the hardware nested page table feature) on or off.  This
           feature  is  called  EPT  (Extended  Page Tables) by Intel and NPT (Nested Page Tables) or RVI (Rapid
           Virtualisation Indexing) by AMD. If turned off, Xen will run the guest in "shadow  page  table"  mode
           where  the  guest's  page  table updates and/or TLB flushes etc. will be emulated.  Use of HAP is the
           default when available.

       <b>oos=BOOLEAN</b>
           Turns "out of sync pagetables" on or off.  When running in shadow page table mode, the  guest's  page
           table  updates may be deferred as specified in the Intel/AMD architecture manuals.  However, this may
           expose unexpected bugs in the guest, or find bugs in Xen, so it is possible to disable this  feature.
           Use of out of sync page tables, when Xen thinks it appropriate, is the default.

       <b>shadow_memory=MBYTES</b>
           Number  of  megabytes to set aside for shadowing guest pagetable pages (effectively acting as a cache
           of translated pages) or to use for HAP state. By default this is 1MB per guest vCPU plus 8KB  per  MB
           of  guest  RAM.  You  should  not  normally  need to adjust this value. However, if you are not using
           hardware assisted paging (i.e. you are using shadow mode) and your guest workload consists of a  very
           large number of similar processes then increasing this value may improve performance.

           On  Arm,  this field is used to determine the size of the guest P2M pages pool, and the default value
           is the same as x86 HAP mode, plus 512KB to cover the extended regions. Users should adjust this value
           if bigger P2M pool size is needed.

   <b>Device-Model</b> <b>Options</b>
       The following options control the selection of the device-model.  This is the  component  which  provides
       emulation  of  the  virtual  devices to an HVM guest.  For a PV guest a device-model is sometimes used to
       provide backends for certain PV devices (most usually a virtual framebuffer device).

       <b>device_model_version="DEVICE-MODEL"</b>
           Selects which variant of the device-model should be used for this guest.

           Valid values are:

           <b>qemu-xen</b>
               Use the device-model merged into the upstream QEMU project.  This device-model is the default for
               Linux dom0.

           <b>qemu-xen-traditional</b>
               Use the device-model based upon the historical Xen fork of QEMU.  This device-model is still  the
               default for NetBSD dom0.

           It  is  recommended  to  accept  the default value for new guests.  If you have existing guests then,
           depending on the nature of the guest Operating System, you may wish to force them to use  the  device
           model which they were installed with.

       <b>device_model_override="PATH"</b>
           Override  the  path  to  the  binary  to be used as the device-model running in toolstack domain. The
           binary provided here MUST be consistent with the <b>device_model_version</b> which you have  specified.  You
           should not normally need to specify this option.

       <b>stubdomain_kernel="PATH"</b>
           Override the path to the kernel image used as device-model stubdomain.  The binary provided here MUST
           be  consistent  with  the  <b>device_model_version</b>  which  you  have  specified.   In  case of <b>qemu-xen-</b>
           <b>traditional</b> it is expected to be MiniOS-based stubdomain image, in case of <b>qemu-xen</b> it is expected to
           be Linux-based stubdomain kernel.

       <b>stubdomain_cmdline="STRING"</b>
           Set the device-model stubdomain kernel command line to <b>STRING</b>.

       <b>stubdomain_ramdisk="PATH"</b>
           Override the path to the ramdisk image used as device-model stubdomain.  The binary provided here  is
           to  be  used  by  a  kernel pointed by <b>stubdomain_kernel</b>.  It is known to be used only by Linux-based
           stubdomain kernel.

       <b>stubdomain_memory=MBYTES</b>
           Start the stubdomain with MBYTES megabytes of RAM. Default is 128.

       <b>device_model_stubdomain_override=BOOLEAN</b>
           Override the use of stubdomain based device-model.  Normally  this  will  be  automatically  selected
           based upon the other features and options you have selected.

       <b>device_model_stubdomain_seclabel="LABEL"</b>
           Assign an XSM security label to the device-model stubdomain.

       <b>device_model_args=[</b> <b>"ARG",</b> <b>"ARG",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Pass  additional  arbitrary  options  on  the  device-model command line. Each element in the list is
           passed as an option to the device-model.

       <b>device_model_args_pv=[</b> <b>"ARG",</b> <b>"ARG",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Pass additional arbitrary options on the device-model command line for a PV device model  only.  Each
           element in the list is passed as an option to the device-model.

       <b>device_model_args_hvm=[</b> <b>"ARG",</b> <b>"ARG",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Pass additional arbitrary options on the device-model command line for an HVM device model only. Each
           element in the list is passed as an option to the device-model.

   <b>Keymaps</b>
       The keymaps available are defined by the device-model which you are using. Commonly this includes:

               ar  de-ch  es  fo     fr-ca  hu  ja  mk     no  pt-br  sv
               da  en-gb  et  fr     fr-ch  is  lt  nl     pl  ru     th
               de  en-us  fi  fr-be  hr     it  lv  nl-be  pt  sl     tr

       The default is <b>en-us</b>.

       See <b><a href="../man1/qemu.1.html">qemu</a>(1)</b> for more information.

   <b>Architecture</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>options</b>
       <u>ARM</u>

       <b>gic_version="vN"</b>
           Version of the GIC emulated for the guest.

           Currently, the following versions are supported:

           <b>v2</b>  Emulate a GICv2

           <b>v3</b>  Emulate a GICv3. Note that the emulated GIC does not support the GICv2 compatibility mode.

           <b>default</b>
               Emulate  the  same  version  as  the  native  GIC  hardware used by the host where the domain was
               created.

           This requires hardware compatibility with the requested version,  either  natively  or  via  hardware
           backwards compatibility support.

       <b>vuart="uart"</b>
           To enable vuart console, user must specify the following option in the VM config file:

           vuart = "sbsa_uart"

           Currently, only the "sbsa_uart" model is supported for ARM.

       <b>sve="vl"</b>
           The  `sve`  parameter  enables  Arm  Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) usage for the guest and sets the
           maximum SVE vector length, the option is applicable  only  to  AArch64  guests.   A  value  equal  to
           "disabled"  disables  the  feature, this is the default value.  Allowed values are "disabled", "128",
           "256", "384", "512", "640", "768", "896", "1024", "1152", "1280",  "1408",  "1536",  "1664",  "1792",
           "1920", "2048", "hw".  Specifying "hw" means that the maximum vector length supported by the platform
           will  be used.  Please be aware that if a specific vector length is passed and its value is above the
           maximum vector length supported by the platform, an error will be raised.

       <b>llc_colors=[</b> <b>"RANGE",</b> <b>"RANGE",</b> <b>...]</b>
           Specify the Last Level Cache (LLC) color configuration for the guest.  <b>RANGE</b> can be either  a  single
           color value or a hypen-separated closed interval of colors (such as "0-4").

       <b>nr_spis="NR_SPIS"</b>
           An  optional  integer  parameter  specifying  the  number  of  SPIs (Shared Peripheral Interrupts) to
           allocate for the domain. Max is 991 SPIs. If the  value  specified  by  the  `nr_spis`  parameter  is
           smaller  than  the  number of SPIs calculated by the toolstack based on the devices allocated for the
           domain, or the `nr_spis` parameter is not specified, the value calculated by the  toolstack  will  be
           used  for  the  domain.  Otherwise, the value specified by the `nr_spis` parameter will be used.  The
           number of SPIs should match the highest interrupt ID that will be assigned to the domain.

       <u>x86</u>

       <b>mca_caps=[</b> <b>"CAP",</b> <b>"CAP",</b> <b>...</b> <b>]</b>
           (HVM only) Enable MCA capabilities besides default ones enabled by Xen hypervisor for the HVM domain.
           "CAP" can be one in the following list:

           <b>"lmce"</b>
               Intel local MCE

           <b>default</b>
               No MCA capabilities in above list are enabled.

       <b>msr_relaxed=BOOLEAN</b>
           The "msr_relaxed" boolean is an interim option, and defaults to false.

           In Xen 4.15, the default behaviour for unhandled MSRs has been changed, to avoid  leaking  host  data
           into guests, and to avoid breaking guest logic which uses #GP probing to identify the availability of
           MSRs.

           However,  this  new  stricter  behaviour  has  the  possibility to break guests, and a more 4.14-like
           behaviour can be selected by setting this option.

           If using this option is necessary to fix an issue, please report a bug.
