</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-dc25 - SANE backend for Kodak DC20/DC25 Digital Cameras

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-dc25</b>  library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to Kodak
       DC20 and DC25 cameras.  At present, only the DC25 has been tested, but since the code is based on a  DC20
       interface program, it is likely to work for that model also.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       The  current  version  of  the backend only allows one camera to be connected.  The device name is always
       "0".

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The contents of the <u>dc25.conf</u> specify the serial port and baud rate to use.  The baud rate specifies  the
       maximum  rate to use while downloading pictures.  (The camera is always initialized using 9600 baud, then
       switches to the higher rate).  On my 90MHz Pentium, I usually have no problems downloading at 115200 baud
       as long as the system is not excessively busy and the "interrupt-unmask flag" is set in  the  IDE  driver
       (<u>hdparm</u> <u>-u1</u>).  Supported baud rates are: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200.

       The  dumpinquiry  line  causes  some information about the camera to be printed to stderr during startup.
       Note:  This is not compatible with saned, so make sure you don't have any dumpinquiry lines  if  you  are
       using saned (i.e. scanning on a remote machine using a network).

       Empty  lines  and  lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  A sample configuration file is shown
       below:

              port=/dev/ttyS0
              # this is a comment
              baud=115200
              dumpinquiry

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/dc25.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file (see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-dc25.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-dc25.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.   On  *NIX  systems,  the  directories  are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are
              separated by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file is  searched
              in  two  default  directories: first, the current working directory (".") and then in <u>/etc/sane.d</u>.
              If the value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separator  character,  then  the
              default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being
              searched (in this order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_DC25</b>
              If the library was compiled with debugging support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              debug  level  for  this  backend.  A value of 128 requests maximally copious debug output; smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Known bugs/limitations are:

       I haven't figured out how to trigger an option reload following a "scan."  This causes  problems  when  a
       new picture is snapped for example, the slider that is used to select the picture from the camera may not
       be updated immediately.

       More  general  comments,  suggestions,  and  inquiries  about  frontends  or  SANE  should go to the SANE
       Developers mailing list (see <u><a href="http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html">http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html</a></u> for details).   You  must  be
       subscribed to the list, otherwise your mail won't be sent to the subscribers.
