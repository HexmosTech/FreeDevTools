</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-epjitsu - SANE backend for Epson-based Fujitsu USB scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-epjitsu</b> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend which provides basic access
       the Fujitsu fi-60F/fi-65F and ScanSnap S300/S1300(i)/S1100(i) scanners.

</pre><h4><b>HARDWARE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       These scanners are fairly limited, only supporting a couple of modes and resolutions, and always scanning
       full width. The backend supports missing  modes  (binary,  grayscale)  and  intermediate  resolutions  in
       software, but provides only minimal scan area controls. See <b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES.</b>

       This  backend may support other scanners. If physical inspection reveals an Epson chipset, please contact
       the author for instructions on collecting a USB trace under Windows to verify.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A limited effort has been made to expose the standard options to the API.  This allows a frontend to  set
       resolution, color mode, and choose the ADF setting. The <b>sane-epjitsu</b> backend supports the following basic
       options for most scanners:

       <b>source</b> <b>s</b>
              Selects  the  source  for  the  scan. Options may include "Flatbed", "ADF Front", "ADF Back", "ADF
              Duplex".

       <b>mode</b> <b>m</b>
              Selects the mode for the scan. Options may include "Lineart", "Gray", "Color".

       <b>resolution</b>, <b>y-resolution</b>
              Controls scan resolution. Setting <b>--resolution</b> also sets <b>--y-resolution</b>, though this  behavior  is
              overridden by some frontends.

       Other options will be available based on the capabilities of the scanner. Use <u>'scanimage</u> <u>--help'</u> to get a
       list.  Be  aware  that  some  options may appear only when another option has been set, and that advanced
       options may be hidden by the frontend.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file <u>/etc/sane.d/epjitsu.conf</u> is used to tell the backend how to look for scanners, and
       provide options controlling the operation of the backend. This file is read each time the  frontend  asks
       the backend for a list of scanners, generally only when the frontend starts. If the configuration file is
       missing, the backend will not work.

       Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in two ways:

       "usb 0x04c5 0x10c7" (or other vendor/product ids)
              Requests  backend  to  search  all usb buses in the system for a device which uses that vendor and
              product id. The device will then be queried to determine if it is a supported scanner.

       "usb /dev/usb/scanner0" (or other device file)
              Some systems use a kernel driver to access usb scanners. This method is untested.

       The only configuration option supported is "firmware /PATH/TO/FILE", allowing you to set the location  of
       the firmware file you have extracted from the Windows driver.

       <b>Note:</b> This firmware is a copyrighted work of Fujitsu, so cannot be provided by the backend or the author.
       Please do not ask.

       <b>Note:</b>  These  scanners  REQUIRE a firmware file to function. See the supplied configuration file for more
       detail.

       <b>Note:</b> This option may appear multiple times in the  configuration  file.  It  only  applies  to  scanners
       discovered by 'usb' lines that follow this option.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  backend  uses  a  single environment variable, <b>SANE_DEBUG_EPJITSU,</b> which enables debugging output to
       stderr. Valid values are:

              5  Errors
              10 Function trace
              15 Function detail
              20 Option commands
              25 USB trace
              30 USB detail
              35 Useless noise

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
              Only limited scan area options are exposed.
              fi-60F and fi-65F hardware grayscale mode is  not  used,  because  the  calibration  code  is  not
              finished.
