</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-epson - SANE backend for EPSON scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-epson</b> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to Epson
       flatbed scanners.  Some functions of this  backend  should  be  considered  <b>beta-quality</b>  software!  Most
       functions  have  been  stable  for  a long time, but of course new development can not and often will not
       function properly from the very first day. Please report any strange behavior to the  maintainer  of  the
       backend.

       At present, the following scanners are known to work with this backend:

              Model:                       Connection Type
              ---------------------------  -------------------

              GT-6500                      SCSI (use only the line "scsi" in epson.conf)
              ActionScanner II             SCSI, parallel
              GT-7000                      SCSI

              and many more. The official list is on the Sane web site.

       For  other  scanners  the  software   may  or  may  not  work.   Please  send  mail to the backend author
       (<u><a href="mailto:khk@khk.net">khk@khk.net</a></u>) to report success with scanners not on the list or problems with scanners that are listed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options the backend supports can either be selected through command line  options  to  programs  like
       <b><a href="../man1/scanimage.1.html">scanimage</a></b>(1) or through GUI elements in programs like <b><a href="../man1/xscanimage.1.html">xscanimage</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/xsane.1.html">xsane</a></b>(1).

       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using:

              scanimage --help -d epson

       Not all devices support all options.

       <u>Scan</u> <u>Mode</u>
              The  <b>--mode</b>  switch  selects the basic mode of operation of the scanner. Valid choices are Binary,
              Gray and Color.  The Binary mode is black and white only, Gray will produce 256 levels of gray  or
              more  depending on the scanner and Color means 24 bit color mode or more depending on the scanner.
              Some scanners will internally use 36 bit color, their external interface however may only  support
              24 bits.

              The  <b>--depth</b>  option selects the bit depth the scanner is using. This option is only available for
              scanners that support more than one bit depth. Older scanners will always transfer  the  image  in
              8bit  mode. Newer scanners allow one to select either 8 bits, 12 or 14 bits per color channel. For
              a color scan this means an effective color depth of 36 or 42 bits over  all  three  channels.  The
              valid choices depend on the scanner model.

              The  <b>--halftoning</b>  switch  selects the mode that is used in Binary mode. Valid options are "None",
              "Halftone A (Hard Tone)", "Halftone B (Soft Tone)", "Halftone C  (Net  Screen)",  "Dither  A  (4x4
              Bayer)",  "Dither B (4x4 Spiral)", "Dither C (4x4 Net Screen)", "Dither D (8x4 Net Screen)", "Text
              Enhanced Technology", "Download pattern A", and "Download pattern B".

              The <b>--dropout</b> switch selects the so called dropout color. Valid options are None, Red,  Green  and
              Blue. The default is None. The dropout color is used for monochrome scanning and selects the color
              that is not scanned. This can be used to e.g. scan an original with a colored background.

              The <b>--brightness</b> switch controls the brightness of the scan. Valid options are integer values from
              -3 to 3. The default is 0. The larger the brightness value, the brighter the image gets. If a user
              defined table for the gamma correction is selected, the brightness parameter is not available.

              The <b>--sharpness</b> switch sets the sharpness of the image data. Valid options are integer values from
              -2  to 2, with -2 meaning "Defocus", -1 "Defocus slightly", 0 "Normal", 1 "Sharpen slightly" and 2
              "Sharpen".

              The <b>--gamma-correction</b> switch controls the scanner's internal gamma correction. Valid options  are
              "Default",  "User  defined",  "High  density  printing"  "Low density printing" and "High contrast
              printing".

              The <b>--color-correction</b> switch controls the scanner's internal  color  correction  function.  Valid
              options  are  "No  Correction",  "Impact-dot printers", "Thermal printers", "Ink-jet printers" and
              "CRT monitors". The default is "CRT monitors".

              The <b>--resolution</b> switch selects the resolution for a scan. Some EPSON scanners will  scan  in  any
              resolution  between the lowest and highest possible value. The list reported by the scanner can be
              displayed using the "--help -d epson" parameters to <b><a href="../man1/scanimage.1.html">scanimage</a></b>(1).

              The <b>--mirror</b> option controls the way the image is scanned. By reading the image data from right to
              left the image is mirrored. Valid options are "yes" and "no". The default is "no".

              The <b>--speed</b> option can improve the scan speed in monochrome mode. Valid options are "yes" or "no",
              the "yes" option will speed up the scan if this option is supported.

              The <b>--auto-area-segmentation</b> switch activates  the  automatic  area  segmentation  for  monochrome
              scans.  The scanner will try to determine which areas are text and which contain images. The image
              areas will be halftoned, and the text will be improved. Valid options  are  "yes"  and  "no".  The
              default is "yes".

              The  <b>--gamma-table</b>  parameter can be used to download a user defined gamma table. The option takes
              256 values from the range 0-255. In color mode this option equally affects  the  red,  green,  and
              blue channel.

              The  <b>--red-gamma-table</b>  parameter  can  be used to download a user defined gamma table for the red
              channel. The valid options are the same as for --gamma-table.

              The <b>--green-gamma-table</b> parameter can be used to download a user defined gamma table for the green
              channel. The valid options are the same as for --gamma-table.

              The <b>--blue-gamma-table</b> parameter can be used to download a user defined gamma table for  the  blue
              channel. The valid options are the same as for --gamma-table.

              The  color  correction  coefficients  <b>--cct-1</b>  <b>--cct-2</b>  <b>--cct-3</b>  <b>...</b>  <b>--cct-9</b>  will  install color
              correction coefficients for the user defined color correction. Values are specified as integers in
              the range -127..127.

              The <b>--preview</b> option requests a preview scan. The frontend software automatically  selects  a  low
              resolution. Valid options are "yes" and "no". The default is "no".

              The  <b>--preview-speed</b>  options  will  increase  the scan speed if this is supported by the scanner.
              Valid options are "yes" and "no", the default is "no".

              The geometry options <b>-l</b> <b>-t</b> <b>-x</b> <b>-y</b> control the scan area: <b>-l</b> sets the top left x coordinate, <b>-t</b>  the
              top left y coordinate, <b>-x</b> selects the width and <b>-y</b> the height of the scan area. All parameters are
              specified in millimeters.

              The <b>--quick-format</b> option lets the user select a scan area with predefined sizes. Valid parameters
              are  "CD",  "A5  portrait",  "A5 landscape", "Letter", "A4" and "max". The default is "max", which
              selects the largest possible area.

              The <b>--source</b> option selects the scan source. Valid options depend on the  installed  options.  The
              default is "Flatbed".

              The <b>--auto-eject</b> option will eject a page after scanning from the document feeder.

              The <b>--film-type</b> option will select the film type for scans with the transparency unit. This option
              is  only  activated  if  the TPU is selected as scan source. Valid options are "Negative Film" and
              "Positive Film".

              The <b>--focus-position</b> option selects the focus position for all scans.  Valid  options  are  "Focus
              2.5mm above glass" and "Focus on glass". The focus on the 2.5mm point above the glass is necessary
              for scans with the transparency unit, so that the scanner can focus on the film if one of the film
              holders  is  used.   This option is only functional for selected scanners, all other scanners will
              ignore this option.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file <u>/etc/sane.d/epson.conf</u> specifies the device(s) that the backend will use. Possible
       connection types are:

       <u>SCSI</u>   This is the default, and if nothing else is specified the backend software will open a given  path
              as SCSI device. More information about valid syntax for SCSI devices can be found in <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5).
              Usually  SCSI  scanners are configured with a line "scsi EPSON" in this file. In some cases it may
              be necessary to only use the string "scsi" (e.g. for the GT-6500).

       <u>PIO</u> <u>-</u> <u>Parallel</u> <u>Interface</u>
              The parallel interface can be configured in two ways: An integer value starting at  the  beginning
              of  a  line  will be interpreted as the IO address of the parallel port. To make it clearer that a
              configured IO address is a parallel port the port address can be preceded by the string "PIO". The
              PIO connection does not use a special device file in the <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> directory. The  IO  address  can  be
              specified in hex mode (prefixed with "0x").

       <u>USB</u>    A  device  file  that  is  preceded  by the string "USB" is treated as a scanner connected via the
              Universal Serial Bus. The correct special device file has to be created prior  to  using  it  with
              Sane. See the USB documentation for more information about how to set up the USB subsystem and the
              required device files.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-epson.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-epson.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_DEBUG_EPSON</b>
              If  the  library  was  compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128 requests  all  debug  output  to  be  printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_EPSON_SCSI</b>
              If  the  library  was  compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              SCSI related debug level for this backend.  Only a value of 2 is supported.

       <b>SANE_EPSON_CMD_LVL</b>
              This allows one to override the function or command level that the  backend  uses  to  communicate
              with the scanner. The function level a scanner supports is determined during the initialization of
              the  device.  If the backend does not recognize the function level reported by the scanner it will
              default to function level B3. Valid function levels are A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, D1
              and F5. Use this feature only if you know what you are doing!

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5), <b><a href="../man1/scanimage.1.html">scanimage</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/xscanimage.1.html">xscanimage</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/xsane.1.html">xsane</a></b>(1)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       None :-) At least none are currently known.

</pre><h4><b>UNSUPPORTED</b> <b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       The backend may be used with Epson scanners that are not yet listed under the list of supported  devices.
       A scanner that is not recognized may default to the function level B3, which means that not all functions
       that the scanner may be capable of are accessible.

       If  the  scanner  is  not  even  recognized  as an Epson scanner this is probably because the device name
       reported by the scanner is not in the correct  format.  Please  send  this  information  to  the  backend
       maintainer  (email  address  is in the AUTHOR section of this man page or in the AUTHORS file of the SANE
       distribution).

       The Perfection 600, Perfection 650, Perfection 660, Perfection 1250 and Perfection 1260 are not supported
       by this backend.
