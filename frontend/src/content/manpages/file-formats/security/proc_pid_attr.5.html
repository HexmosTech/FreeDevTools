       /proc/pid/attr/ - security-related attributes

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/attr/</u>
              The  files  in this directory provide an API for security modules.  The contents of this directory
              are files that can be read  and  written  in  order  to  set  security-related  attributes.   This
              directory  was  added  to support SELinux, but the intention was that the API be general enough to
              support other security modules.  For the purpose of explanation,  examples  of  how  SELinux  uses
              these files are provided below.

              This directory is present only if the kernel was configured with <b>CONFIG_SECURITY</b>.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/attr/current</u> (since Linux 2.6.0)
              The contents of this file represent the current security attributes of the process.

              In  SELinux,  this  file is used to get the security context of a process.  Prior to Linux 2.6.11,
              this file could not be used to set the security context (a write was always denied), since SELinux
              limited process security transitions to <b><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></b>(2) (see  the  description  of  <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/attr/exec</u>,
              below).  Since Linux 2.6.11, SELinux lifted this restriction and began supporting "set" operations
              via  writes  to this node if authorized by policy, although use of this operation is only suitable
              for applications that are trusted to maintain any desired  separation  between  the  old  and  new
              security contexts.

              Prior  to  Linux 2.6.28, SELinux did not allow threads within a multithreaded process to set their
              security context via this node as it would yield an inconsistency among the security  contexts  of
              the  threads  sharing  the same memory space.  Since Linux 2.6.28, SELinux lifted this restriction
              and began supporting "set" operations for threads  within  a  multithreaded  process  if  the  new
              security  context is bounded by the old security context, where the bounded relation is defined in
              policy and guarantees that the new security context has a subset of the  permissions  of  the  old
              security context.

              Other security modules may choose to support "set" operations via writes to this node.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/attr/exec</u> (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This file represents the attributes to assign to the process upon a subsequent <b><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></b>(2).

              In  SELinux,  this  is  needed  to support role/domain transitions, and <b><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></b>(2) is the preferred
              point to make such transitions because it offers better control over  the  initialization  of  the
              process  in  the  new  security label and the inheritance of state.  In SELinux, this attribute is
              reset on <b><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></b>(2) so that the new program reverts to the default behavior for any <b><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></b>(2) calls
              that it may make.  In SELinux, a process can set only its own <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/attr/exec</u> attribute.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/attr/fscreate</u> (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This file represents the attributes to assign to files created by  subsequent  calls  to  <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2),
              <b><a href="../man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/symlink.2.html">symlink</a></b>(2), and <b><a href="../man2/mknod.2.html">mknod</a></b>(2)

              SELinux employs this file to support creation of a file (using the aforementioned system calls) in
              a  secure  state, so that there is no risk of inappropriate access being obtained between the time
              of creation and the time that attributes  are  set.   In  SELinux,  this  attribute  is  reset  on
              <b><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></b>(2),  so that the new program reverts to the default behavior for any file creation calls it
              may make, but the attribute will persist across multiple file  creation  calls  within  a  program
              unless it is explicitly reset.  In SELinux, a process can set only its own <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/attr/fscreate</u>
              attribute.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/attr/keycreate</u> (since Linux 2.6.18)
              If  a process writes a security context into this file, all subsequently created keys (<b><a href="../man2/add_key.2.html">add_key</a></b>(2))
              will be labeled  with  this  context.   For  further  information,  see  the  kernel  source  file
              <u>Documentation/security/keys/core.rst</u>  (or  file  <u>Documentation/security/keys.txt</u> between Linux 3.0
              and Linux 4.13, or <u>Documentation/keys.txt</u> before Linux 3.0).

       <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/attr/prev</u> (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This file contains the security context of the process before the last  <b><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></b>(2);  that  is,  the
              previous value of <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/attr/current</u>.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/attr/socketcreate</u> (since Linux 2.6.18)
              If  a  process  writes a security context into this file, all subsequently created sockets will be
              labeled with this context.
