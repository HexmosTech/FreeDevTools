  "description": "<p>An <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus\">abacus</a>, an ancient tool used to count and calculate by moving beads. Depicted as a wooden frame with four or more rows or columns of variously positioned and colored beads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Used for various content concerning mathematics and science (education) as well as calculations,&nbsp;counting, and numbers more generally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designs from Apple&nbsp;and Facebook resemble a Chinese abacus (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suanpan\"><em>suanpan</em></a>), as did a <a href=\"/microsoft/windows-11/abacus/\">previous</a> Microsoft design. By one reckoning, Apple&rsquo;s red-beaded&nbsp;design displays the number 108 and Emojipedia&#39;s, 12,031,981.</p>",

This emoji elegantly symbolizes calculation, education, history, and meticulous planning, offering a sophisticated visual cue for discussions involving numbers or traditional methods on Apple devices."
