  "apple_vendor_description": "The hippopotamus emoji on Apple devices is a robust and friendly depiction, featuring a large, gray, rounded body with a characteristically wide snout and small ears. Apple's design imbues it with a gentle, almost cuddly appearance through its smooth, 3D shading and realistic lighting, making it feel substantial yet approachable. This emoji is often used to represent the animal itself, or sometimes to allude to something large, powerful, or even a bit cumbersome in a lighthearted way within Apple communications."
