  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the thread emoji appears as a neatly wound spool of bright red thread, its soft rounded edges catching the light with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading. Realistic lighting emphasizes the subtle texture of the wound fibers, suggesting a practical, ready-to-use crafting tool. This emoji on Apple devices is often used to signify sewing, mending, or a connection being formed, embodying a sense of meticulous care and creation."
