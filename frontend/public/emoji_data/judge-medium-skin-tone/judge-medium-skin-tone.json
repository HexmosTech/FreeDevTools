  "apple_vendor_description": "The judge emoji on Apple devices embodies authority and fairness, depicted with a medium skin tone and a stern yet impartial expression. Apple's design language imbues the judge with a sense of gravitas, highlighted by the glossy texture of the judicial robe and the subtle sheen on the gavel, which appears ready to strike. Its smooth, rounded edges and realistic 3D shading contribute to its dignified presence, commonly used to symbolize justice, law, or a final decision."
