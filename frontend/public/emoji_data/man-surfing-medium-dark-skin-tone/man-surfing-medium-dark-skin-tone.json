The water is rendered with Apple's signature smooth gradients and realistic lighting, creating shimmering highlights and cool blues that evoke the ocean's spray.  His athletic posture and the subtle gloss on his skin, characteristic of Apple's 3D design, convey action, adventure, and the thrill of mastering the waves."
