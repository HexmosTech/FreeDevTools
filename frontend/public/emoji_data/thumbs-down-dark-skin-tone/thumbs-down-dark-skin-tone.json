  "description": "This version of the  Thumbs Down emoji has the  Dark Skin Tone applied, which is displayed as a Black Skin Tone on supported platforms.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The thumbs-down emoji on Apple devices showcases a hand with a deep, rich dark skin tone, rendered with Apple's signature realistic lighting and soft, rounded edges. The thumb points decisively downwards, conveying a clear message of disapproval or disagreement with a glossy, tactile finish. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is perfect for politely rejecting an idea or indicating a lack of interest in digital conversations."
