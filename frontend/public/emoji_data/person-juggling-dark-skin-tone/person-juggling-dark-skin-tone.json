  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the person juggling, presented with a dark skin tone, is a dynamic and skillful representation of multitasking and managing multiple tasks. The figures are depicted with a sense of effortless motion, their limbs fluid and their expressions focused, enhanced by Apple's characteristic realistic lighting and soft rounded edges. This emoji, with its vibrant colors and sense of controlled chaos, is ideal for conveying busyness, adaptability, or a sense of accomplishment when handling many things at once on Apple devices."
