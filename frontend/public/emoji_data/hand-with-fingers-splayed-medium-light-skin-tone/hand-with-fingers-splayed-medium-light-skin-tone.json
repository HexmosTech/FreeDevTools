Apple‚Äôs signature realistic lighting and smooth gradients create a subtle, lifelike texture, emphasizing the soft rounded edges of the fingertips. This versatile emoji conveys openness, readiness to receive, a high-five gesture, or a simple greeting, embodying a friendly and approachable signal."
