Apple‚Äôs characteristic soft rounded edges prevent it from appearing too harsh, while realistic lighting gives it a tangible sense of depth and volume. This emoji is commonly used to represent organization, data storage, important documents, or the process of retrieving information, evoking a feeling of order and accessibility."
