  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the deaf woman emoji with dark skin tone is illustrated with a serene and engaged expression, her hand gracefully positioned near her ear and mouth in a gesture of communication. Apple’s design imbues her with subtle yet clear facial features and realistic lighting, ensuring a respectful and nuanced representation. This emoji on Apple devices is a vital symbol of inclusivity and awareness for the Deaf community, often used to discuss accessibility, sign language, or to represent a person who is deaf and communicates through signing."
