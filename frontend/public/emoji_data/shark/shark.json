Its design showcases Apple's mastery of realistic lighting and gradients, giving its gray skin a subtle sheen and its fins a sharp, defined edge.  The slightly open mouth and piercing eye, rendered with Apple's characteristic detail, suggest the creature's primal nature, often used playfully to represent danger, the ocean, or a bold, decisive action in messages sent on Apple devices."
