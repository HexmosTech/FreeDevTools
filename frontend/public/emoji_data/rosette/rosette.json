  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rosette emoji is a beautifully rendered floral emblem, featuring layered petals in a deep, rich red or magenta hue, sculpted with Apple's signature 3D glossy shading and subtle highlights. The soft rounded edges of each petal create a sense of delicate texture, while realistic lighting enhances its three-dimensional appearance, making it look almost tangible. On Apple devices, this elegant bloom symbolizes beauty, achievement, or a special recognition, often used to convey admiration or to mark an occasion with sophisticated charm."
