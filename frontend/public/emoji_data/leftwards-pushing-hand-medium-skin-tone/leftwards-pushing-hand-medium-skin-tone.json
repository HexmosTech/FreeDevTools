  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the leftwards pushing hand emoji, presented in a clear medium skin tone, is designed with Apple's characteristic smooth, rounded edges and subtle 3D shading.  The hand is depicted with a gentle yet firm posture, its palm facing left, suggesting a clear directional cue or a subtle yet polite gesture of dismissal.  This meticulously rendered emoji, with its realistic lighting, effectively communicates pushing away, stopping, or indicating a clear boundary in a visually intuitive way."
