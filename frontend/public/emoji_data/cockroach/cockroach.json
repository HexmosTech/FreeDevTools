  "description": "<p>A brown cockroach shown with antennae, six legs, and two sensory pads at its rear called cerci.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can be used to talk about cockroaches or insects in general. May also be used metaphorically as an insult to call a person a pest, an annoyance, or to suggest they are subhuman. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The cockroach emoji on Apple devices presents a surprisingly detailed, albeit unsettling, rendering with Apple's signature 3D treatment. Its segmented body and antennae are clearly defined, with realistic textures and subtle highlights that emphasize its form. While often used to convey disgust or something unwelcome, this emoji, in true Apple fashion, is rendered with a clear, distinct visual presence."
