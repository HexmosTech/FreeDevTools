  "apple_vendor_description": "The light-skinned ninja emoji on Apple devices is rendered with a dynamic pose, cloaked in shadowy blues and blacks with subtle hints of movement. Apple's signature 3D shading imbues the ninja with a sense of stealth and agility, featuring soft, rounded edges and realistic lighting that suggests a hidden presence. This emoji is perfect for conveying secrecy, surprise, or a swift, silent action in digital conversations on Apple devices."
