  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the cow face emoji presents a friendly and placid bovine expression, rendered with Apple's signature smooth, rounded features and gentle shading. Its large, liquid eyes, highlighted with a soft gleam, convey a sense of calm curiosity, while the subtle 3D effect gives its muzzle a slightly rounded, approachable appearance. The earthy brown and white tones, enhanced by realistic lighting, make it a charming representation of farm life, nature, or a simple, contented feeling, often used in lighthearted or pastoral contexts."
