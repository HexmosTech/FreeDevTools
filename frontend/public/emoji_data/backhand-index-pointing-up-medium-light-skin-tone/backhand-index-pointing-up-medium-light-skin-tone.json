Apple's characteristic glossy finish and subtle shading give the finger a realistic texture and a sense of depth. The rounded tip and smooth contours of the knuckle ensure it appears both direct and friendly, making it a versatile tool on Apple devices for indicating direction, emphasis, or agreement with a stylish, digital flourish."
