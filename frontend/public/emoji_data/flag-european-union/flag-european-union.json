Apple's meticulous attention to detail ensures the stars are sharp and the blue has a smooth, almost velvety gradient, conveying a sense of unity and aspiration. This emoji serves as a direct symbol of the European Union, its values, and its member states, appearing prominently in discussions about politics, travel, and international relations.",
