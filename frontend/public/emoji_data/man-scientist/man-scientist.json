His expression is one of focused curiosity, conveyed through his clear, bright eyes and a subtle, intelligent gaze, all framed by soft rounded edges. He often holds a beaker or flask, its contents shimmering with smooth gradients, symbolizing innovation, discovery, and the pursuit of knowledge in scientific endeavors, a common and respected motif on Apple devices."
