  "apple_vendor_description": "The deaf man emoji on Apple devices depicts a man with a warm, neutral expression, his hands gently positioned to indicate 'hearing' with a downward motion near his ear. Apple's design imbues him with soft, rounded edges and realistic lighting, giving him a friendly and approachable demeanor. This emoji conveys understanding, empathy, or a desire to communicate in a way that acknowledges differing abilities, fostering inclusivity within digital conversations on Apple devices."
