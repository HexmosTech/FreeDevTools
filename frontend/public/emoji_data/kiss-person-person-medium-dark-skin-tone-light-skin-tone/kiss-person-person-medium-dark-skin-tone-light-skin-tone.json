  "apple_vendor_description": "This iteration of the kiss emoji on Apple devices showcases two figures with distinct skin tones – one medium-dark and the other light – leaning in for a gentle kiss, their lips almost touching. The signature Apple 3D shading creates a soft, rounded appearance for their faces and hair, while realistic lighting adds a warm, intimate glow. On Apple devices, it conveys affection, romance, or a tender farewell, embodying a nuanced expression of love between two individuals with distinct representation."
