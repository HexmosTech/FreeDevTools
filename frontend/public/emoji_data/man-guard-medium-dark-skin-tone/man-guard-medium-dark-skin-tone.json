  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man guard emoji stands tall and resolute, distinguished by a medium-dark skin tone and clad in a crisp uniform rendered with Apple's characteristic attention to detail. The glossy 3D shading lends a polished, authoritative feel to his attire, with subtle highlights suggesting sturdy fabric and metallic accents. His composed expression and upright posture, typical of Apple's design language, convey a sense of duty, protection, and vigilance, making it ideal for symbolizing security or a watchful presence."
