  "apple_vendor_description": "The play button emoji on Apple devices is a sleek, crimson triangle, rendered with Apple’s characteristic glossy 3D shading and a prominent highlight that suggests a polished, almost metallic surface. Its smooth, rounded corners and vibrant color are designed to be instantly recognizable and inviting, embodying the essence of starting something. On Apple devices, this emoji is the universal symbol for initiating playback, starting a video, or beginning an action."
