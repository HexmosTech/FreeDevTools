  "description": "A hand with the thumb and index finger pinched together, often indicating a small amount or a subtle gesture of disapproval. This version has a medium skin tone.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the pinched fingers emoji with a medium skin tone is a dynamic and expressive gesture, captured with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting. The fingers are curved precisely, creating a distinct pinch that conveys a range of subtle meanings from questioning to incredulity or even a desire for a small amount of something.  The soft rounded edges and lifelike texture make this emoji feel remarkably tactile and versatile in conveying nuanced emotions and intentions in digital messages."
