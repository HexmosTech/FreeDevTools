It's depicted as a perfectly squared box, adorned with a bright, patterned paper featuring a classic polka dot or stripe design, all rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading that makes it pop. A neatly tied satin ribbon, often in a contrasting bold color, cascades over the top, catching the light to highlight its smooth texture and add a touch of sophisticated charm.  This emoji is an ideal way to convey excitement for birthdays, holidays, or any occasion deserving of a special present when communicating on Apple devices."
