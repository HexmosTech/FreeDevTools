Its minimalist design, characterized by soft, rounded edges and a lack of discernible emotion, conveys a neutral or unreadable state, a subtle yet effective communication tool. On Apple devices, this emoji captures a sense of stoicism or a deliberate lack of reaction, perfect for situations where words might be too much."
