Their faces are softly curved, and the gentle blush on their cheeks, enhanced by realistic lighting, conveys warmth and intimacy.  The smooth gradients and rounded edges of their features, a hallmark of Apple's design, make this emoji a heartfelt expression of love, romance, or a fond farewell in messages sent on Apple devices."
