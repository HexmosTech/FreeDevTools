  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the handshake emoji is rendered with a deep, warm medium-dark skin tone, showcasing Apple's commitment to diverse representation. The two hands, presented with their palms facing each other, are angled to suggest a firm, confident clasp, enhanced by subtle, realistic lighting that emphasizes their texture and the gentle rounding of the fingers. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, powerfully conveys agreement, collaboration, and mutual respect, offering a visual cue for solidarity and partnership in digital conversations."
