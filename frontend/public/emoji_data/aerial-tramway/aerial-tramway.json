  "description": "<p>An Aerial Tramway, most commonly seen at ski resorts, for transport between locations on a mountain. Can also be used as a tourist attraction, or as a form of public transport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2018 this emoji was the focus of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17613850/twitter-least-used-emoji-tramway\">a grassroots campaign on Twitter</a> where users of the platform began using this emoji more frequently. This was to update the least-used emoji on emojitracker.com (as tracked by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leastUsedEmoj\">@leastUsedEmoji</a> Twitter bot) from the Aerial Tramway to another emoji.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the aerial tramway emoji captures the iconic suspension cable car gliding gracefully against a backdrop of soft, gradient skies, typical of Apple's aesthetic.  The tram car itself is depicted with smooth, rounded edges and a polished metallic finish, reflecting subtle highlights that emphasize its sleek design.  Its elevated position and the delicate suspension cables convey a sense of adventure, scenic views, and unique transportation methods, often used for travel or to describe mountainous regions."
