The tram car itself is depicted with smooth, rounded edges and a polished metallic finish, reflecting subtle highlights that emphasize its sleek design.  Its elevated position and the delicate suspension cables convey a sense of adventure, scenic views, and unique transportation methods, often used for travel or to describe mountainous regions."
