  "description": "The Man Shrugging, Type-5 emoji is a sequence of the  Shrug,  Emoji Modifier Fitzpatrick Type-5, ? Male Sign and ? Variation Selector-16",
  "apple_vendor_description": "This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, features a man with a medium-dark skin tone with a classic, expressive shrug. Apple’s design language brings him to life with smooth, rounded shoulders and a slightly tilted head, all rendered with realistic lighting and subtle shading for a tactile feel. His open palms and uncertain expression, typical of Apple’s nuanced character designs, perfectly convey a sense of 'I don't know,' confusion, or nonchalance in digital communication."
