  "apple_vendor_description": "This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, features a man with a medium-dark skin tone with a classic, expressive shrug. Apple‚Äôs design language brings him to life with smooth, rounded shoulders and a slightly tilted head, all rendered with realistic lighting and subtle shading for a tactile feel. His open palms and uncertain expression, typical of Apple‚Äôs nuanced character designs, perfectly convey a sense of 'I don't know,' confusion, or nonchalance in digital communication."
