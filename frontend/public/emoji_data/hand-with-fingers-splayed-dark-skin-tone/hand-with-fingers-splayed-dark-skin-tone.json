  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the hand with splayed fingers emoji is rendered in a rich, dark skin tone with a subtle sheen that highlights its dimensionality. The fingers are gracefully separated, showcasing Apple's attention to realistic hand gestures and smooth gradients that create a tactile impression. This versatile emoji, with its open palm, often communicates a sense of openness, welcome, or a playful 'talk to the hand' dismissal, all with the polished aesthetic Apple is known for."
