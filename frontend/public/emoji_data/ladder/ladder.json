  "description": "<p>A wooden ladder with four or five rungs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Used to represent ladders or the action of climbing. Also used metaphorically to represent systems through which you can climb, for example the corporate ladder or social ladder.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the ladder emoji is depicted as a sturdy, classic wooden stepladder with a slight sheen that highlights its rounded edges and realistic wood grain texture. The subtle, soft lighting across its rungs and sides suggests durability and reliability, embodying ascent, progress, and overcoming challenges. This visually tactile representation on Apple devices makes it ideal for conveying ambition or the steps needed to achieve a goal."
