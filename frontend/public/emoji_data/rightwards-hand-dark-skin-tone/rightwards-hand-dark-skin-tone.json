  "apple_vendor_description": "The rightwards hand emoji on Apple devices, presented with a dark skin tone, is rendered with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients, giving it a polished and inviting appearance. The hand is open and facing towards the right, symbolizing direction, movement forward, or a welcoming gesture. On Apple devices, this emoji is often used to indicate progression, to point towards something to the right in a message, or to convey openness and receptiveness."
