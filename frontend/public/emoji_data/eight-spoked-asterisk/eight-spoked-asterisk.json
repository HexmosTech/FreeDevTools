  "apple_vendor_description": "The eight-spoked asterisk emoji on Apple devices is a vibrant and precisely rendered geometric symbol, radiating outward with a clean, sharp aesthetic. Its smooth, 3D-like appearance, achieved through Apple's signature glossy shading and realistic lighting, makes it pop with visual energy. This emoji serves to emphasize points, denote special notes, or add a touch of sparkle and attention-grabbing flair to text on Apple devices."
