  "apple_vendor_description": "This heartwarming emoji on Apple devices depicts a tender moment between a light-skinned woman and a man with a neutral, skin-tone-less representation, sharing a gentle kiss. The soft, rounded edges and realistic lighting on Apple's design give the figures a smooth, almost sculpted appearance, conveying affection and romance.  The woman's lips are slightly parted, and her eyes are closed, suggesting a moment of sweet intimacy that is universally understood in digital communication on Apple devices."
