  "apple_vendor_description": "The mango emoji on Apple devices is a vibrant and juicy depiction of the tropical fruit, showcasing a gradient of warm reds, oranges, and yellows that capture its ripe sweetness. Its rounded form is rendered with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and soft, inviting highlights, making it look incredibly inviting. This delicious emoji, as it appears on Apple devices, is perfect for expressing a love for exotic fruits, summer vibes, or simply adding a taste of sunshine to your messages."
