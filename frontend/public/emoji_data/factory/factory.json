  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's factory emoji stands as a robust symbol of industry and production, featuring a classic brick facade with visible windows and a prominent smokestack emitting a gentle plume of stylized smoke. The 3D shading and realistic lighting on Apple devices lend it a substantial and tangible presence, suggesting large-scale operations and manufacturing. This emoji is commonly used to represent industrial sites, economic activity, or the creation of goods and services."
