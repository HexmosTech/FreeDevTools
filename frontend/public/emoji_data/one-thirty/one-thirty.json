  "apple_vendor_description": "Displayed on Apple devices, the '1:30' emoji features a classic analog clock face with bold, clear numerals and hands precisely indicating half past one. Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading gives the clock face a subtle depth, with realistic lighting that makes the hands appear tangible against the dial. The soft, rounded edges of the clock casing ensure a friendly and intuitive visual, commonly used to denote specific times for appointments, meetings, or events within the digital communication landscape on Apple products."
