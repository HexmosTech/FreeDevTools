Apple‚Äôs signature glossy 3D shading gives the clock face a subtle depth, with realistic lighting that makes the hands appear tangible against the dial. The soft, rounded edges of the clock casing ensure a friendly and intuitive visual, commonly used to denote specific times for appointments, meetings, or events within the digital communication landscape on Apple products."
