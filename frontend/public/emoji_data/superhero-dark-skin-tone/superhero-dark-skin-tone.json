  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the superhero emoji with dark skin tone stands tall and proud, radiating strength and optimism. Its design features Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, giving the costume a polished, almost heroic sheen, with subtle highlights that emphasize its dynamic posture. The determined expression and outstretched hand, rendered with smooth gradients and soft rounded edges, convey a powerful sense of readiness to protect and inspire, making it a perfect emoji for moments of triumph or encouragement."
