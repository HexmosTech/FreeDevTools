  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the hot dog emoji is a mouthwatering depiction of a classic comfort food, featuring a plump sausage nestled in a soft, glossy bun with a slight sheen. Apple's characteristic 3D shading and realistic lighting give the bun a pillowy texture and the sausage a savory depth, while condiment details like mustard squiggles are rendered with precise, soft rounded edges. This delightful emoji is perfect for expressing cravings, casual dining, or enjoying a day at the ballpark, bringing a touch of playful indulgence to your messages."
