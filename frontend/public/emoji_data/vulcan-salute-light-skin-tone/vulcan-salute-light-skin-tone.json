  "description": "This version of the  Vulcan Salute emoji has the  Light Skin Tone applied, which is displayed as a Pale Skin Tone on supported platforms",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The Vulcan salute emoji on Apple devices, rendered with a light skin tone, presents a graceful and precise hand gesture. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading gives it a polished, almost sculpted appearance, with subtle highlights that emphasize the separation of the ring and middle fingers. This iconic symbol of peace and long life, as seen on Apple devices, conveys a sense of thoughtful well-wishing and intellectual greeting."
