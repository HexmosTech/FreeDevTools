  "apple_vendor_description": "The kiss man emoji on Apple devices features a person with a medium-dark skin tone, leaning in with closed eyes and slightly pursed lips, ready to plant a kiss. Apple's characteristic soft rounded edges and realistic lighting give this emoji a gentle, affectionate appearance, conveying warmth and romantic sentiment. It's a versatile way to send a loving gesture or express fondness in messages, enhanced by the tactile quality of Apple's design."
