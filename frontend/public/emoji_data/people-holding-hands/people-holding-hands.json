  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this emoji beautifully depicts two hands clasped together, rendered with Apple’s signature smooth gradients and subtle 3D shading.  The skin tones are presented with naturalistic warmth and soft, rounded edges, conveying a feeling of unity, support, and deep connection.  This symbol is frequently used on Apple devices to represent partnership, friendship, or shared experiences."
