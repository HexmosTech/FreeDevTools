  "apple_vendor_description": "The elf emoji, depicted on Apple devices with a medium-light skin tone, exudes an ethereal charm with its pointed ears and often whimsical attire.  Its design benefits from Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, giving its tunic and accessories a slightly magical sheen, while realistic lighting adds depth and a touch of fantasy.  With soft rounded edges and a gentle, often curious expression, this emoji symbolizes magic, folklore, and the fantastical, perfect for adding a touch of enchantment to messages."
