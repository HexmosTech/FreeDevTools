Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and soft, rounded edges give the cane a tangible feel, while realistic lighting highlights the subtle details of his expression, conveying resilience and independence. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, represents navigating the world with confidence and is used to signify accessibility, awareness, or personal journeys."
