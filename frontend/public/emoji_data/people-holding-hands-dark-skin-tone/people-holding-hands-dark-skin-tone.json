  "description": "Two people holding hands, representing connection, partnership, love, or friendship. The dark skin tone specifies the appearance of both individuals.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the people holding hands with dark skin tones are illustrated with a profound sense of connection and unity, rendered with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges. The gentle touch and subtle shading convey warmth and solidarity, enhanced by realistic lighting that suggests intimacy. This emoji powerfully symbolizes friendship, partnership, love, or a united front, often used to express support or belonging."
