  "apple_vendor_description": "The person standing emoji on Apple devices is depicted with a simple, upright posture and smooth, rounded contours, embodying a sense of presence and readiness.  Apple's characteristic soft lighting and subtle gradients give the figure a clean, approachable look, suggesting a neutral stance or a general representation of an individual.  It's commonly used to signify a person being present, participating, or simply acknowledging someone's existence in a digital context."
