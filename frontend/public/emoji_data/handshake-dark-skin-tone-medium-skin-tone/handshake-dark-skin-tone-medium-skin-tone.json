  "apple_vendor_description": "The handshake emoji on Apple devices is a powerful symbol of agreement and collaboration, featuring two hands meeting in a firm clasp with one hand in a dark skin tone and the other in a medium skin tone. Apple's detailed 3D shading brings out the texture of the skin and the subtle interplay of light, while the soft rounded edges of the fingers convey a sense of genuine connection. This emoji, as rendered on Apple devices, is excellent for confirming deals, celebrating partnerships, or expressing mutual respect."
