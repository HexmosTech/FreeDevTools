  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s triangular flag emoji appears as a vibrant pennant, its fabric rippling slightly with a sense of gentle movement brought to life by realistic lighting. The smooth gradients and soft rounded edges of the flag’s form give it a tactile, almost tangible quality on Apple devices. This emoji on Apple devices commonly represents a starting point, a marker, a signal, or the announcement of something new and exciting, often used to draw attention to a specific location or event."
