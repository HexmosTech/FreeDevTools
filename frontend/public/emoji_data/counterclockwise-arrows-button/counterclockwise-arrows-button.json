  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the counterclockwise arrows button is rendered with crisp, dynamic lines and a satisfying sense of movement. The two arrows, depicted in a vibrant blue, gracefully loop and curve against a clean white background, showcasing Apple's signature soft gradients and realistic lighting. This emoji beautifully captures the essence of reversal, repetition, or the act of undoing, offering a visually intuitive way to communicate cyclical processes or a desire to go back on Apple devices."
