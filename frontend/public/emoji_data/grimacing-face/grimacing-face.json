  "apple_vendor_description": "The grimacing face emoji on Apple devices presents a vivid illustration of discomfort or embarrassment, its cheeks flushed with a rosy hue. Its eyes are wide and slightly contorted, and the mouth forms an exaggerated, downturned grimace, all rendered with Apple's signature smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges. This emoji effectively communicates awkwardness, a cringe-worthy moment, or a situation that's just a little too much to handle with a smile."
