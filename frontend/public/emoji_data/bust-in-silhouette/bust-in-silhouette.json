  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the bust in silhouette emoji appears as a stark, elegantly rendered profile of a human head and shoulders in deep black. Its clean lines and absence of detail, a hallmark of Apple's minimalist design, allow it to represent anonymity, a generic user, or an unspecified individual. This emoji is often used in contexts where identity is unknown, irrelevant, or deliberately obscured."
