  "apple_vendor_description": "The Japanese 'Open for Business' button on Apple devices is a bright, inviting green circle, rendered with a smooth gradient and subtle 3D effect. Its clean, rounded edges and clear, crisp white Japanese characters communicate openness and welcome with a distinctly Apple aesthetic. This emoji is ideal for signifying that a business is currently open and ready to receive customers or inquiries."
