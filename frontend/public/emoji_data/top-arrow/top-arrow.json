  "apple_vendor_description": "The top arrow emoji on Apple devices is a bold, upward-pointing chevron, rendered with Apple's signature glossy finish and clean, sharp edges. Its bright, energetic hue and subtle 3D shading give it a dynamic feel, signifying direction, advancement, or a command to move upwards. This emoji on Apple devices is commonly used to indicate the top of a page, a return to the beginning, or a positive trajectory."
