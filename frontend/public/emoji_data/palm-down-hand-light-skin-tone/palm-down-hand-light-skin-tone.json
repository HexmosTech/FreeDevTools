The palm faces the viewer, with fingers slightly curved, and the lighting accentuates its soft edges and gentle contours, a hallmark of Appleâ€™s design. This emoji is commonly used to signify 'stop', 'wait', 'calm down', or to offer a gesture of reassurance and gentle direction in digital communication."
