  "description": "Represents a hand with the palm facing down, often used to signal 'stop', 'wait', or to push something away. The light skin tone indicates a fairer complexion.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the palm-down hand emoji with a light skin tone is depicted with a smooth, rounded shape and subtle shading that gives it a realistic, almost tangible quality. The palm faces the viewer, with fingers slightly curved, and the lighting accentuates its soft edges and gentle contours, a hallmark of Apple‚Äôs design. This emoji is commonly used to signify 'stop', 'wait', 'calm down', or to offer a gesture of reassurance and gentle direction in digital communication."
