  "apple_vendor_description": "The flag of Guinea, as rendered on Apple devices, features bold, distinct vertical stripes of red, yellow, and green, each with a subtle 3D sheen and smooth gradient that makes it appear almost tangible. Apple's design language ensures sharp, clean lines with soft, rounded edges, giving the flag a polished and official look. This emoji serves as a clear and proud representation of Guinea, its culture, and its people in digital communication."
