  "apple_vendor_description": "This depiction of two women holding hands on Apple devices features a striking contrast between a deep, rich dark skin tone and a warm medium-dark skin tone, both rendered with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges. Realistic lighting emphasizes the gentle clasp of their hands, conveying a powerful sense of connection, solidarity, and love. On Apple devices, this emoji beautifully represents diverse relationships, friendship, and mutual support, celebrating inclusivity."
