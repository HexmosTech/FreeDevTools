The emoji features precise detailing and a smooth, slightly glossy finish, characteristic of Apple's commitment to inclusivity and detailed design. His hand is positioned to form the sign for 'deaf' with gentle, rounded edges, conveying understanding, empathy, and a connection to the deaf community, often used to express solidarity or communicate a specific message on Apple devices."
