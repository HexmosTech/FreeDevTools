  "description": "A man with a medium-light skin tone, with his hand cupped to his ear and his thumb extended, indicating he is deaf or hard of hearing. This emoji signifies communication challenges or the deaf community.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendering of the deaf man with a medium-light skin tone portrays a dignified individual with a clear, expressive gesture. The emoji features precise detailing and a smooth, slightly glossy finish, characteristic of Apple's commitment to inclusivity and detailed design. His hand is positioned to form the sign for 'deaf' with gentle, rounded edges, conveying understanding, empathy, and a connection to the deaf community, often used to express solidarity or communicate a specific message on Apple devices."
