  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's raised back of hand emoji displays a clean, stylized hand with its palm facing away, rendered with smooth gradients and soft rounded edges that feel approachable and modern. The subtle gloss on the knuckles and the gentle shadowing give it a lifelike quality, embodying a gesture of stopping, caution, or acknowledgment on Apple devices. It's a versatile symbol for pausing a conversation or signaling a clear boundary."
