  "description": "A hand pointing to the left, with a medium-dark skin tone. Used to indicate direction, a previous item, or to push something away.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "This specific hand emoji on Apple devices features a medium-dark skin tone, depicted with Apple's characteristic realistic lighting and glossy 3D shading that gives it a tangible, almost sculpted appearance. The hand is angled to push purposefully towards the left, its fingers slightly splayed and its palm subtly curved, all with soft, rounded edges. It's commonly used on Apple devices to indicate stopping, pushing away, or a firm refusal, conveying a clear gesture of rejection or a need for space."
