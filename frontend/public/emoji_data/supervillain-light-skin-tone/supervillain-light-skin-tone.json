  "apple_vendor_description": "The supervillain emoji on Apple devices is depicted with a dramatic flair, featuring a light skin tone and a menacing, yet stylized, expression. Its costume, rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and sharp angles, exudes power and mystery, while realistic lighting casts subtle shadows that enhance its imposing presence. This emoji, often used with a wink or for playful exaggeration, signifies grand schemes, mischievous intentions, or a touch of dramatic flair in digital conversations."
