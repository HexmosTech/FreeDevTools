  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this emoji portrays a loving couple formed by a man with a light skin tone and a woman with a neutral skin tone, their hands clasped as a vibrant red heart floats between them, a signature touch of Apple's warm design. The figures are rendered with smooth gradients and subtle 3D shading, creating a gentle, affectionate feel, while the heart itself boasts a polished, glossy finish. This emoji is a beautiful way to express romantic love, deep affection, or the formation of a partnership within Apple’s communication ecosystem."
