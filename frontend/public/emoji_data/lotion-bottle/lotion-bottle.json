  "apple_vendor_description": "The lotion bottle emoji on Apple devices presents a sleek, modern design with a pearlescent white finish that catches the light beautifully. Its soft rounded edges and subtle 3D rendering give it a tactile feel, suggesting a premium skincare product. This emoji, with its clean aesthetic, is often used to represent self-care, beauty routines, or the feeling of being refreshed and moisturized."
