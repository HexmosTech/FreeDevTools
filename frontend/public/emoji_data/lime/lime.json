  "apple_vendor_description": "The lime emoji on Apple devices is a burst of zesty freshness, depicted as a perfectly round, bright green citrus fruit with a wonderfully smooth, glossy surface. Realistic lighting catches its subtle texture, hinting at a juicy interior, while soft rounded edges give it a delightfully approachable look. On Apple devices, this emoji conveys a sense of vibrant flavor, tartness, and healthy zest, often used to represent refreshing drinks, culinary ingredients, or a lively, sharp attitude."
