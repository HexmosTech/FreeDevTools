The musculature is subtly defined by realistic lighting, emphasizing effort and physical exertion within its smooth, rounded form.  This emoji powerfully conveys themes of fitness, strength training, personal achievement, and the pursuit of health, all rendered with a polished and dynamic feel on Apple devices."
