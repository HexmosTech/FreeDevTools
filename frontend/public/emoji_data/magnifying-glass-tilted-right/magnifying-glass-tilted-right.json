  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the tilted magnifying glass features a polished metallic frame with a clear, convex lens that catches the light, showcasing Apple's commitment to realistic rendering and glossy 3D shading. The handle is smoothly curved, and the overall design suggests meticulous examination or a keen search for detail. Used on Apple devices, this emoji signifies investigation, discovery, or the act of looking closely at something."
