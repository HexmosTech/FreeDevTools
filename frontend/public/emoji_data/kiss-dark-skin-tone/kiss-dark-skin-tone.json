  "description": "A face blowing a kiss, often with closed eyes and a rosy cheek, signifying affection, love, or a playful farewell.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the kiss with dark skin tone emoji conveys a warm and affectionate gesture, featuring a pair of lips with a rich, deep complexion.  The emoji is rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, giving the lips a soft, plump appearance and reflecting light beautifully to emphasize their sensuality.  Its smooth, rounded edges and gentle highlights make it a heartfelt way to express love, passion, or a sweet greeting."
