  "apple_vendor_description": "The man with red hair emoji on Apple devices features a distinct and vibrant portrayal, with rich, fiery red hair that stands out against a smoothly rendered face, accented by Apple's signature glossy 3D shading.  Realistic lighting highlights the contours of his features, and the soft rounded edges of his design contribute to a friendly, approachable appearance.  This emoji, with its unique characterization, is a great way to represent individuals with red hair or to add a touch of bold personality to messages on Apple devices."
