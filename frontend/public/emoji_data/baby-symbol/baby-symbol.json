Rendered with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges, it conveys a sense of innocence and new beginnings. The subtle 3D shading adds a touch of gentle realism to the clean design, often used to signify childbirth, parenthood, or anything related to infants and young children."
