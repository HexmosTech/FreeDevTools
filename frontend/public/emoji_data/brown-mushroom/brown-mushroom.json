  "apple_vendor_description": "The brown mushroom emoji on Apple devices is a charming illustration of a classic toadstool with a rounded cap and a sturdy stem. Apple’s design language imbues it with a realistic texture, thanks to its subtle shading and smooth, natural curves, making it feel almost tactile. It’s frequently used to signify nature, foraging, healthy eating, or sometimes in a playful, whimsical context on Apple devices."
