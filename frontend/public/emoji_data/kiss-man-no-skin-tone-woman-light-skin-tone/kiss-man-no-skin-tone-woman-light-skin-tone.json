Appleâ€™s signature 3D shading and soft, rounded edges give the figures a gentle and affectionate appearance, highlighting the tender moment. This symbol is often used to express romantic love, a heartfelt greeting, or a profound sense of connection between partners, rendered with Apple's characteristic warmth."
