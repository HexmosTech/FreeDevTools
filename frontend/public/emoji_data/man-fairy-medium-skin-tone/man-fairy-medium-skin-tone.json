  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man fairy emoji with a medium skin tone is depicted with an ethereal glow and delicate, translucent wings that shimmer with soft gradients. His form, rendered with Apple's characteristic smooth, rounded edges, suggests a playful and magical presence. The realistic lighting accentuates his gentle expression and the subtle flow of his attire, bringing to life a creature of myth and wonder, often used to convey enchantment, whimsy, or a touch of the extraordinary."
