  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's 'soon' arrow emoji is a bold, upward-pointing chevron rendered in a vibrant, optimistic shade of blue, with a sleek, glossy finish that catches the light.  The 3D design, characterized by smooth gradients and soft rounded edges, imbues it with a sense of momentum and anticipation, as if pushing forward towards a future event.  This emoji is commonly used on Apple devices to signify that something is coming up, approaching quickly, or is on the horizon."
