  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the person kneeling emoji with dark skin tone is rendered with a posture of respect, contemplation, or perhaps supplication, featuring gentle curves and subtle shading. The realistic lighting emphasizes the respectful bend of the knees and the attentive positioning of the hands, conveying a sense of humility or deep thought. This emoji, with its characteristically soft rounded edges on Apple devices, is often used to represent prayer, apology, or a moment of quiet reflection."
