Apple's characteristic soft rounded edges and subtle, realistic lighting create a sense of intimacy and affection between the figures, whose skin tones are beautifully nuanced. This emoji is a powerful symbol of romantic love and partnership between two men, used to express affection, celebrate relationships, or share romantic sentiment with the characteristic warmth and inclusivity of Apple's emoji set."
