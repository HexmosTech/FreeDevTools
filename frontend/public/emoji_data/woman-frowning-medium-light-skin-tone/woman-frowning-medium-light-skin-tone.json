  "description": "The Woman Frowning, Type-3 emoji is a sequence of the  Person Frowning,  Emoji Modifier Fitzpatrick Type-3, ? Female Sign and ? Variatio",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the frowning woman emoji with medium-light skin tone embodies a thoughtful, perhaps slightly displeased, expression with subtly downturned lips and a thoughtful gaze.  Apple's signature glossy 3D shading lends a realistic depth to her features, while smooth gradients create a natural and approachable appearance.  The overall tone suggests contemplation, mild disappointment, or a need for consideration, making it a nuanced way to convey a less than enthusiastic sentiment."
