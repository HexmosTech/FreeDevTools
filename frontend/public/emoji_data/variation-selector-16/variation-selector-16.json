  "apple_vendor_description": "The variation selector 16 emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is an invisible control character designed to influence the rendering of preceding emojis for enhanced specificity. While not visually represented itself, its presence ensures that subsequent characters, particularly those with multiple gender or skin tone options, appear as intended by the sender, a subtle yet powerful aspect of Apple's emoji system."
