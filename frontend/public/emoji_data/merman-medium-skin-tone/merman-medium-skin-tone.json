  "description": "A merman with medium skin tone, representing a mythical male sea creature. Often used to express fantasy, the ocean, or LGBTQ+ pride.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The merman emoji on Apple devices showcases a distinguished figure with a medium skin tone, his torso rendered with Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting. His powerful tail, a shimmering blend of oceanic blues and greens, gracefully curves, embodying the mythical allure of the sea. This emoji, with its smooth gradients and soft rounded edges, is perfect for conveying a sense of fantasy, strength, or a connection to aquatic themes."
