  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the older person emoji with medium skin tone features a kind, wise face with subtle, rounded lines that suggest experience and a lifetime of stories. Apple's characteristic realistic lighting and soft, smooth gradients create a warm and approachable appearance, while the gentle curves of the face evoke a sense of comfort and familiarity. This emoji is a respectful representation of elders, wisdom, and the generation that has shaped our world, often used to convey respect, love, or a connection to family."
