  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of a man bouncing a ball, with light skin tone, showcases dynamic movement and athletic energy through its smooth, 3D shading. The ball, a vibrant red sphere, appears to be in mid-bounce with subtle highlights that suggest its motion and Apple's characteristic realistic lighting. This emoji embodies joy, playfulness, sports, and active participation, perfectly captured with the soft rounded edges of Apple's emoji style."
