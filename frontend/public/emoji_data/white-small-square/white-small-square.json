  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the white small square emoji is rendered with impeccable crispness and a subtle, almost imperceptible sheen. Its perfectly geometric form, defined by soft, rounded edges characteristic of Apple's design language, makes it a clean and versatile element. This emoji is frequently used to represent selection, order, or as a minimalist visual marker in digital communication, feeling both deliberate and modern on your Apple screen."
