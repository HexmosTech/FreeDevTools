  "apple_vendor_description": "The bubble tea emoji on Apple devices is a delightful and vibrant representation, featuring a translucent cup filled with a creamy beverage and dark, chewy tapioca pearls at the bottom. Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting make the drink look refreshingly cool and inviting, with gentle highlights reflecting off the smooth surfaces. This emoji is often used to express enjoyment of sweet drinks, a desire for a casual outing, or to share a moment of sweet indulgence."
