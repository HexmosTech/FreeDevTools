  "apple_vendor_description": "The man juggling emoji on Apple devices is a dynamic depiction of skill and lightheartedness, his light skin tone rendered with the brand's signature glossy 3D shading that makes the objects in motion almost leap off the screen. He's shown with a cheerful expression and energetic posture, his arms a blur as he keeps multiple colorful balls or objects airborne, all exhibiting the soft rounded edges and realistic lighting typical of Apple's emoji design. This emoji, vibrantly brought to life on Apple devices, perfectly captures a feeling of multitasking, managing many tasks with ease, or simply a sense of playful accomplishment and fun."
