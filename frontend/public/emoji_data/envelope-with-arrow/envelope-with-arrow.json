  "apple_vendor_description": "The envelope with arrow emoji on Apple devices is depicted as a crisp, white stationery envelope with a bright blue arrow arcing upwards and to the right, signifying movement and dispatch. Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting make the paper texture subtly apparent, conveying a sense of official communication or prompt delivery. It's commonly used to indicate sent messages, email notifications, or the act of sending something out digitally on Apple devices."
