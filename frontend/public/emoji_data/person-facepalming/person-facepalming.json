  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the facepalming emoji depicts a stylized figure bringing their palm to their forehead with a pronounced sense of exasperation. The generous 3D shading and soft, rounded edges on Apple’s rendering emphasize the gesture’s universally understood meaning of disbelief or utter defeat. This emoji on Apple devices is perfect for conveying moments of embarrassment, frustration, or when something has gone hilariously wrong."
