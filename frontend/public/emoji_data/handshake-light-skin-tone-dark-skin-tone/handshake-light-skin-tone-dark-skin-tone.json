  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the handshake emoji showcases two hands, one with a light skin tone and the other with a dark skin tone, clasped in a firm, professional grip. Apple's meticulous attention to detail brings out the subtle textures of skin and the gleam of realistic lighting on the rounded knuckles, symbolizing agreement, partnership, or reconciliation. This emoji is a universally understood gesture of trust and cooperation, often used to seal a deal or acknowledge a mutual understanding."
