Apple's meticulous attention to detail brings out the subtle textures of skin and the gleam of realistic lighting on the rounded knuckles, symbolizing agreement, partnership, or reconciliation. This emoji is a universally understood gesture of trust and cooperation, often used to seal a deal or acknowledge a mutual understanding."
