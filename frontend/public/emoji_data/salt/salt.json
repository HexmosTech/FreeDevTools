  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the salt emoji is presented as a small, transparent shaker filled with fine, sparkling white grains.  Apple's typical attention to detail is evident in the realistic lighting that catches the crystals, making them glint, and the subtle gloss on the shaker’s glass.  Its smooth, rounded contours and clear depiction make it an easily recognizable symbol for seasoning, flavor, or sometimes, to suggest taking something with a grain of salt, offering a nuanced meaning in communication."
