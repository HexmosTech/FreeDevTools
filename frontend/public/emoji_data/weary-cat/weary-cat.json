  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the weary cat emoji embodies utter exhaustion with its languid posture and droopy eyelids, rendered with Apple's signature soft, rounded edges and gentle 3D shading. Its fur appears almost plush, with subtle highlights that convey a sense of comfort despite the evident fatigue.  The downturned mouth and half-closed eyes, animated with Apple's characteristic realistic lighting, communicate a feeling of being overwhelmed, tired, or in need of rest, making it a relatable expression for many on Apple devices."
