A single, elegantly shaped leaf, rendered with vibrant color and soft, realistic lighting, appears to be caught in a gentle breeze.  Apple's signature smooth gradients and subtle 3D shading give the leaf a lifelike quality, evoking feelings of change, autumn, or the ephemeral beauty of nature.  Its soft, rounded edges contribute to an overall sense of delicate movement, making it a beautiful visual metaphor for the passage of time or a shift in circumstances on your Apple device."
