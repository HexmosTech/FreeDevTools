Apple’s design emphasizes the iconic trefoil symbol with sharp, precise edges, often given a slightly raised, three-dimensional quality through subtle shading. This emoji clearly warns of hazardous materials, potential danger, or scientific experimentation, and is commonly used in contexts related to nuclear energy, science, or even to metaphorically represent something intensely powerful or dangerous."
