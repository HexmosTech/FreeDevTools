The realistic lighting accentuates its curve, giving it a tactile feel that speaks to its purpose in healthcare and well-being. This emoji, as rendered by Apple, is a clear symbol of medical care, listening, and concern, often used to convey support for someone undergoing treatment or to signify a doctor's appointment in digital conversations."
