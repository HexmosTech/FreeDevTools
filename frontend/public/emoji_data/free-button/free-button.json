  "apple_vendor_description": "The 'FREE' button on Apple devices presents a vibrant, slightly convex rectangle with a bright, almost luminous white background.  Bold, sans-serif lettering in a deep blue clearly spells out 'FREE', enhanced by Apple's signature soft, rounded edges and subtle 3D shading that suggests it's ready to be pressed.  This emoji is commonly used to signify a special offer, a complimentary item, or something available without cost in online shopping or promotional messages on Apple devices."
