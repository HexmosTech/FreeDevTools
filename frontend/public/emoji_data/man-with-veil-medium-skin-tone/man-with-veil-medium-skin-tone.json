The veil is depicted with soft, flowing lines and subtle gradients, while the realistic lighting adds a touch of intrigue to the visible features, all framed by smooth rounded edges. This emoji on Apple devices is often used to represent cultural traditions, religious ceremonies, or a sense of hidden beauty and elegance."
