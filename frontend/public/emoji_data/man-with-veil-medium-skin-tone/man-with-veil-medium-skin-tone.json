  "description": "A man with a medium skin tone, wearing a veil. This emoji can represent various cultural or religious practices, or a disguise.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the medium skin tone man with a veil emoji presents a figure shrouded in mystery and cultural significance, rendered with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading for depth. The veil is depicted with soft, flowing lines and subtle gradients, while the realistic lighting adds a touch of intrigue to the visible features, all framed by smooth rounded edges. This emoji on Apple devices is often used to represent cultural traditions, religious ceremonies, or a sense of hidden beauty and elegance."
