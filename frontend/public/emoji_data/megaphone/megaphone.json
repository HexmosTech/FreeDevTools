Its smooth, rounded shape and distinct handle give it a solid, impactful presence, while the subtle shading adds a realistic three-dimensional quality. This emoji, with its implied amplification, is perfect for signaling important news, rallying support, or simply drawing attention to a message on Apple devices."
