  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the flag of Wales emoji is a striking display of the Welsh dragon, Y Ddraig Goch, set against a clean white and green background. The dragon, rendered with Apple's signature bold lines and smooth shading, appears dynamic and proud, its red form standing out vibrantly. This emoji, presented with crisp detail and a touch of glossy finish on Apple devices, is a clear symbol of Welsh national pride, heritage, and identity."
