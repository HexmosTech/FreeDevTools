The hands are rendered with Apple's signature realistic lighting and subtle glossy shading, highlighting the distinct yet harmonious tones of each skin color. The smooth, rounded edges and gentle curvature of their joined hands evoke a sense of partnership, love, and unity, making it a beautiful symbol for relationships and shared experiences."
