  "description": "<p>A white paper receipt, as proof of payment, and shown flat or curled. May be used for other financial documents (e.g., invoice, tax form). May also be used for the slang <i>receipts</i>, or &quot;evidence&rdquo; or &ldquo;confirmation&rdquo; of some feat or controversy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some vendors feature easter eggs. Apple&rsquo;s design, for instance, displays the date of <a href=\"/calendar/\">July 17</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://worldemojiday.com\">World Emoji Day</a>);&nbsp;items referencing its 1997&ndash;2002 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different\"><i>Crazy Ones</i>/<i>Think Different</i></a> ad campaign (<i>misfits</i>, <i>square pegs</i>, <i>round holes</i>);&nbsp;and a balance $0.00.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The receipt emoji on Apple devices appears as a neatly folded slip of paper, complete with crisp, slightly creased edges that give it a tactile feel. Rendered with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and soft gradients, it subtly suggests a purchase, a transaction, or a record of expenses. The subtle shadow beneath it adds to its realistic presentation, making it a straightforward visual for managing finances or confirming a sale."
