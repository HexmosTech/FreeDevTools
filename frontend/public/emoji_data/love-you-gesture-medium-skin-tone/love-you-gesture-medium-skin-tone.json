  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the 'love you' gesture emoji with a medium skin tone displays a hand forming the sign with its thumb and index finger extended, and the little finger and middle finger raised, all rendered with Apple's signature smooth, rounded edges and realistic lighting. The glossy 3D shading gives it a polished, heartfelt appearance, making the gesture feel genuine and warm. This emoji is a universally understood way to express affection, love, and a heartfelt message of care."
