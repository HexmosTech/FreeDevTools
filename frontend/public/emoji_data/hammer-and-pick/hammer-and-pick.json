  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the hammer and pick emoji presents a robust, metallic hammer with a sturdy wooden handle, crossed diagonally with a sharp, pointed pickaxe, all rendered with Apple's signature realistic lighting and 3D glossy shading. The tools appear well-worn yet functional, conveying a sense of hard work, construction, or excavation with their solid form and subtle surface textures. This iconic pairing, as seen on Apple devices, is commonly used to symbolize labor, building projects, mining, or any endeavor requiring effort and determination."
