  "apple_vendor_description": "The folded hands emoji on Apple devices presents two hands pressed together in a gesture of prayer, gratitude, or deep respect, rendered with Apple's characteristic realistic lighting and soft shadows. Each hand is sculpted with smooth, rounded edges and a subtle pearlescent sheen, suggesting sincerity and humility. This emoji is frequently used on Apple devices to convey thanks, to ask for something, or to express hope and reverence in digital conversations."
