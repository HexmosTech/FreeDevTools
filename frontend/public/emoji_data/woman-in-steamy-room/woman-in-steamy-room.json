  "description": "<p>A woman in a sauna, usually with a towel or robe and sometimes holding a ladle for pouring water on hot stones to create the steamy environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple and Samsung&#39;s designs are also wearing a towel around their head.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman in a steamy room emoji embodies a moment of serene relaxation, her form subtly rendered with soft, rounded edges and realistic lighting.  The steam effect, depicted with delicate, translucent wisps, creates a gentle haze that emphasizes the warmth and comfort of the scene, a signature of Apple's tactile design.  Her expression, calm and content, suggests rejuvenation and self-care, making it perfect for conveying a desire for escape or a post-spa glow in digital conversations."
