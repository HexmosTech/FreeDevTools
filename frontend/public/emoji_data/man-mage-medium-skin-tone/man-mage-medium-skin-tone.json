  "description": "A man with a medium skin tone depicted as a mage or wizard, often holding a staff or wand and wearing a robe. It signifies magic, fantasy, wisdom, and arcane power.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man mage emoji with medium skin tone stands regally, adorned in flowing, deep violet robes that catch the light with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading. A subtle glow emanates from his outstretched hand, hinting at arcane power, all rendered with smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges. This magical figure, unique to Apple's design language, symbolizes wisdom, mystery, and the pursuit of knowledge, often used in contexts of fantasy, creativity, or the extraordinary."
