  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman running with a medium-dark skin tone is depicted in mid-stride, with dynamic motion lines and a determined expression.  Her athletic build is emphasized by Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting, highlighting the smooth musculature and the flow of her hair.  The soft, rounded edges of her form and clothing add to the natural, energetic feel of the emoji, which is ideal for representing fitness, movement, or a personal best in sports and health-related messages on Apple devices."
