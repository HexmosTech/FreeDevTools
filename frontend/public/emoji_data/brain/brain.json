  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the brain emoji is a vibrant and anatomically suggestive representation, rendered in a soft, organic pink with subtle variations in shading that highlight its complex folds and curves. Apple's characteristic realistic lighting and smooth gradients give it a palpable depth, appearing almost three-dimensional and full of potential. This emoji is often used to signify intelligence, deep thought, learning, or a moment of sudden understanding, embodying the power of cognition as portrayed on Apple devices."
