  "apple_vendor_description": "Rendered with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and soft rounded edges, the medium skin-tone palm-down hand emoji displays a relaxed, open gesture. The realistic lighting on Apple devices highlights the subtle contours of the palm and fingers, conveying a sense of calm, dismissal, or the act of placing something down gently. It's a versatile symbol for stopping, acceptance, or a polite decline."
