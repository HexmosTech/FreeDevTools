  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's foot emoji is a clean, simple representation rendered with smooth, rounded edges and subtle shading that gives it a soft, almost toy-like quality. The distinct shape, with a gentle curve and well-defined toes, appears polished and friendly. On Apple devices, this emoji can humorously signify walking, taking a step, or even a lighthearted gesture of putting one's foot down."
