  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the man swimming emoji features a man with a medium skin tone, depicted mid-stroke through shimmering, translucent water. The smooth, fluid motion is captured with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting, making the water appear refreshingly cool and dynamic. Its soft rounded edges and the focused, determined look on the swimmer's face, as seen on Apple devices, evoke a sense of athletic effort, freedom, and the exhilaration of aquatic activity."
