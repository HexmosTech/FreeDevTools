Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading gives it a subtle depth and a polished, tactile feel, suggesting effortless control. This emoji, instantly recognizable on Apple devices, is universally understood to signify advancing to the next song, video, or item in a sequence, embodying forward progression and seamless media navigation."
