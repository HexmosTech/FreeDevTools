  "description": "A mythical creature with wings, often depicted as small and magical. This version represents a medium-dark skin tone.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the medium-dark skin tone fairy emoji is a vision of enchantment, with a soft, luminous glow emanating from her form. Her delicate wings, rendered with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and subtle highlights, appear almost translucent, hinting at magical flight. The gentle smile and serene expression, combined with the flowing attire, evoke a sense of wonder, whimsy, and mystical presence, all brought to life with Apple's polished 3D design."
