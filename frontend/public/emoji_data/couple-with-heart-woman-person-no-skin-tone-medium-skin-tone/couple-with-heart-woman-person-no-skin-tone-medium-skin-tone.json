  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this couple emoji depicts a tender moment with a woman and a person, both rendered with Apple's signature smooth gradients and soft rounded edges, conveying inclusivity. The central heart, a vibrant red with a subtle glossy sheen, pulsates with affection between them, symbolizing love, partnership, and connection. The medium skin tone on one figure adds a touch of realistic diversity, making this representation on Apple devices feel warm and relatable."
