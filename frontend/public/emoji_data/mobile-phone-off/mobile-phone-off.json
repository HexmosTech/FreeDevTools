  "apple_vendor_description": "This iteration of the mobile phone emoji on Apple devices presents a sleek, dark rectangle, appearing completely powered down, with a soft, matte finish that suggests a premium feel. The screen is a deep, inky black, devoid of any interface elements, and the rounded edges are characteristic of Apple's refined hardware design. It subtly communicates a state of disconnection, quiet, or a deliberate break from digital engagement, offering a visual cue for 'do not disturb' or offline status."
