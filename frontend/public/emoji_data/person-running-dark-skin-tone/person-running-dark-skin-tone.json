  "description": "This version of the  Person Running emoji has the  Dark Skin Tone applied, which is displayed as a Black Skin Tone on supported platform",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s rendering of the person running emoji, with a dark skin tone, captures dynamic motion with fluid lines and energetic highlights.  The figure is depicted mid-stride, their clothing and body conveying a sense of speed and exertion, all enhanced by Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading.  The realistic lighting accentuates the form, suggesting a vigorous pursuit or active lifestyle, frequently used to communicate exercise, progress, or a hasty departure."
