  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man in a steamy room emoji depicts a figure enveloped in a warm, misty atmosphere, suggesting relaxation and rejuvenation. Apple's design language uses subtle gradients and soft lighting to evoke the steamy environment, with the man rendered with a peaceful expression and soft rounded edges. This emoji is perfect for conveying the feeling of a spa, sauna, or a moment of unwinding and self-care."
