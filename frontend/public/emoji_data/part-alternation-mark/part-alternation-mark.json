  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the part alternation mark emoji presents as a sophisticated, dark gray symbol with a subtle metallic sheen, clearly rendered with Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading. Its clean, geometric lines and smooth, rounded edges convey a sense of precision and logical structure, as seen in Apple's commitment to refined design. This emoji, distinctively appearing on Apple devices, is often used in technical contexts or to indicate a choice between two options."
