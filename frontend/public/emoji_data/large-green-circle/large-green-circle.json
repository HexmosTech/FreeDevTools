  "apple_vendor_description": "The large green circle emoji on Apple devices presents a perfect, unblemished orb with a rich, saturated emerald hue. Its smooth, glossy surface reflects light with a subtle sheen, highlighting the soft, rounded edges characteristic of Apple's design language. This simple yet bold symbol can represent wholeness, growth, nature, or a positive affirmation within your Apple device communications."
