The head of the baby is recommended to be hidden to avoid a situation where the skin tone of the baby would only correlate to the skin tone of the adult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Variants include <a href=\"/woman-feeding-baby/\">👩&zwj;🍼 Woman Feeding Baby</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"/man-feeding-baby/\">👨&zwj;🍼 Man Feeding Baby</a>.&nbsp;See also&nbsp;<a href=\"/breast-feeding/\">🤱&nbsp;Breast-Feeding</a>.</p>",
