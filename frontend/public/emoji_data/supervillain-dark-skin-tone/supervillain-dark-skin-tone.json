  "apple_vendor_description": "The supervillain emoji with a dark skin tone on Apple devices is depicted with dramatic flair and an imposing presence, complete with flowing cape and a hint of mischief. Apple's signature 3D shading and glossy textures give this character a dynamic, almost cinematic quality, making them stand out in any message. This emoji is commonly employed to playfully allude to mischievous plans, extreme actions, or a touch of theatrical villainy in digital communications on Apple devices."
