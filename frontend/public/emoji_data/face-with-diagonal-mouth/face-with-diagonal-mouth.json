  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this emoji portrays a face with a slightly tilted, lopsided grin, conveying a sense of wry amusement or playful awkwardness. Apple's signature smooth gradients and soft rounded edges give the expression a gentle, approachable feel, while subtle shading adds to its depth. It's perfect for situations where you want to acknowledge something with a hint of irony or a knowing, slightly mischievous undertone."
