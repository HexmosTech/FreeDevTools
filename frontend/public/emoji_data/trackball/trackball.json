  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the trackball emoji presents a polished, dark gray sphere with a subtle sheen, evoking a sense of smooth control and precision. Its soft, rounded edges and realistic 3D shading, characteristic of Apple's design, suggest effortless navigation. This emoji is often used to represent computer peripherals, data input, or tasks requiring careful manipulation within digital workflows."
