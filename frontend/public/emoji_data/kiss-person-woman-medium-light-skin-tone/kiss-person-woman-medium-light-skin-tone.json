  "description": "Depicts a kiss between two women, with one having a medium-light skin tone and the other a default skin tone. It conveys a sense of love, affection, and romantic connection.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the kiss emoji featuring a woman with medium-light skin tone radiates warmth and affection through its soft, luminous rendering. Her lips are slightly puckered, and a subtle blush emanates from her cheeks, enhanced by Apple’s characteristic glossy 3D shading and gentle highlights. This emoji elegantly communicates love, romance, or a sweet goodbye, embodying the tender sentiments often shared digitally with the refined touch of Apple's design."
