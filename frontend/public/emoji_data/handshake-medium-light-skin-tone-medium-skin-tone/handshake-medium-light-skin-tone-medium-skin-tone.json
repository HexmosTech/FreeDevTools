  "description": "Two hands meeting in a handshake, often symbolizing agreement, greeting, or a deal. The medium skin tone indicates a specific representation of the people involved.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the handshake emoji features two hands clasped together, rendered with a sophisticated blend of medium-light and medium skin tones. The realistic lighting and subtle 3D shading give the clasped hands a tactile feel, emphasizing trust and agreement. Apple's design language ensures the soft rounded edges of the fingers and the polished appearance communicate a strong sense of partnership, collaboration, and mutual respect in digital conversations."
