  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this emoji portrays a diverse couple, a woman and a man, with their hands clasped in a medium-dark skin tone, signifying unity and partnership. Apple’s signature 3D shading creates a subtle depth to their skin, while soft gradients and realistic lighting make the hands appear warm and inviting. This representation of connection, often used to symbolize relationships, love, or solidarity, feels exceptionally genuine on Apple devices."
