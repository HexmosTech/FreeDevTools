  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the up button emoji is designed as a clean, rounded square with a prominent, upward-pointing arrow rendered in a bright, solid color, enhanced by Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and subtle highlights. The smooth gradients and soft edges give it a tactile, modern feel, symbolizing ascent, progression, or moving forward. This emoji is commonly used on Apple devices to indicate approval, increase, or a desire to move to a higher level."
