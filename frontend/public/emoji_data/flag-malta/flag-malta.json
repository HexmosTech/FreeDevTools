  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the flag of Malta emoji is presented with crisp detail, its bold red and white fields rendered with a slight sheen that hints at a fabric texture. The sharp edges are subtly softened by Appleâ€™s signature rounded design, giving it a polished yet realistic appearance. This emoji serves as a direct representation of the nation of Malta, its culture, or its people, often used in discussions about travel, national pride, or international events related to the island nation."
