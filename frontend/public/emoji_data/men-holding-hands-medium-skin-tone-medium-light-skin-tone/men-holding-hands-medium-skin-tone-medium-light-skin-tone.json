  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this emoji depicts two men holding hands, rendered with a distinct medium skin tone and a slightly lighter medium skin tone, showcasing Apple's commitment to diverse representation. The smooth gradients and subtle 3D shading give their clasped hands a realistic, tactile feel, with soft rounded edges that convey a sense of closeness and connection. This emoji is a powerful symbol of partnership, love, and solidarity, beautifully illustrated with Apple's signature polished aesthetic."
