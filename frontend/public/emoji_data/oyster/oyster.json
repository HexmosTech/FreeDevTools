  "apple_vendor_description": "The oyster emoji on Apple devices presents a plump, alluring bivalve with a pearlescent sheen. Its shell is rendered with subtle gradients and realistic lighting, showcasing the smooth, curved contours that are a hallmark of Apple's 3D design language. This emoji, appearing refined and inviting on Apple devices, evokes a sense of luxury, delicacy, and perhaps a hint of indulgence, often used to signify fine dining or a special treat."
