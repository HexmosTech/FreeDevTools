  "apple_vendor_description": "The dark skin tone woman facepalming emoji on Apple devices presents a powerful visual of exasperation and disbelief, rendered with Apple's signature 3D glossy shading. Her hand, a deep ebony, is pressed firmly against her forehead, obscuring her eyes, with soft rounded edges and realistic lighting emphasizing the gesture's weight. This emoji on Apple devices perfectly captures moments of overwhelming frustration, embarrassment, or a desire to hide from a situation, conveying a universal feeling with a distinct Apple aesthetic."
