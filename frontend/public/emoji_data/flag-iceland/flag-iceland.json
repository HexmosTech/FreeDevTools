  "apple_vendor_description": "The flag of Iceland on Apple devices is rendered with crisp detail, featuring a bold blue field with a bright white Nordic cross extending to the edges, offset by a vibrant red cross within the white. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading gives the fabric a realistic texture and subtle sheen, as if gently waving in the wind. This emoji, distinctly presented on Apple devices, represents Iceland, its culture, and its people."
