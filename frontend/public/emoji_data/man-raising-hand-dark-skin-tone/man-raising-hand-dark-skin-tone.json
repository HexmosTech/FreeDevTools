  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the man raising hand emoji, in a rich dark skin tone, features a dynamic pose with an uplifted arm and an open palm, conveying enthusiasm and eagerness. The realistic lighting and subtle 3D shading on Apple devices give the figure a sense of presence and energy, while the smooth gradients of the skin tone are characteristic of Apple's polished aesthetic. This emoji, with its distinct rounded features, is commonly used on Apple devices to express a desire to participate, ask a question, or enthusiastically signal agreement."
