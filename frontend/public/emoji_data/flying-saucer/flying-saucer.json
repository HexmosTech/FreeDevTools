  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's flying saucer emoji is a sleek, metallic disc with a pronounced dome, imbued with the company's signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting that gives it an almost tangible presence. On Apple devices, the polished surface reflects ambient light, hinting at otherworldly technology and mystery. This emoji is often used to represent extraterrestrial encounters, science fiction themes, or a sense of the unknown and wondrous."
