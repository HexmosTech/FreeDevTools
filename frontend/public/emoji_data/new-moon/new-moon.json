  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the new moon emoji is a stark, inky black disc, devoid of any visible illumination, representing the celestial body at its darkest phase. Apple's smooth, matte finish and perfectly circular form give it a minimalist yet impactful presence. This emoji on Apple devices symbolizes beginnings, privacy, or the absence of light, often used to set a mysterious or introspective tone in digital communication."
