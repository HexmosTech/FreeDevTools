  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the dark skin tone man getting a haircut emoji presents a common, relatable moment with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and soft rounded edges. The man is shown with a focused expression, leaning slightly as a barber's tool, subtly rendered with realistic lighting, works on his hair. This emoji captures the essence of personal grooming, transformation, and self-care, often used to communicate about appointments, style changes, or simply a routine visit to the salon."
