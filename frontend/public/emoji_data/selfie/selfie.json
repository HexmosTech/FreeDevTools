It features a hand holding a smartphone, angled as if taking a picture of oneself, with a distinctively Apple-esque clean and glossy finish. The soft, rounded edges and realistic lighting give the device and hand a tangible quality, making this emoji a fun way to signify self-expression, social sharing, or a spontaneous photo opportunity."
