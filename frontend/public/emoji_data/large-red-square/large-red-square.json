  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's large red square emoji is a bold and vibrant block of pure crimson, rendered with a smooth, almost lacquered finish and subtle 3D depth. Its perfectly square form and the way light catches its surface are indicative of Apple's attention to detail in realistic lighting and glossy shading. On Apple devices, this striking emoji can signify importance, urgency, a warning, or simply be used as a strong visual element to draw attention within messages."
