The design on Apple devices features clear, distinct hand shapes and a gentle, understanding facial expression, all rendered with Apple's characteristic soft lighting and smooth, rounded forms. This emoji serves as a vital symbol of inclusivity, awareness, and the beautiful diversity of communication methods."
