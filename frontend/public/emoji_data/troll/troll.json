  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's troll emoji is a whimsical and slightly mischievous character, presented with a vibrant green complexion and prominent horns, all rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and playful lighting. The wide, knowing grin and slightly furrowed brow suggest a creature of folklore, often associated with trickery or playful disruption, but on Apple devices, it carries a lighthearted, fun-loving tone. Its rounded, smooth edges and detailed textures make it a visually engaging element in digital conversations."
