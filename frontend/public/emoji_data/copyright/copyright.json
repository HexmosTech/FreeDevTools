  "apple_vendor_description": "The copyright symbol on Apple devices is presented as a bold, perfectly circular 'C' enclosed within a striking ring, rendered with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D effect. Sharp, clean lines and subtle reflections highlight its metallic texture, suggesting authority and protection. This emoji is essential for marking original content, asserting intellectual property rights, and signifying ownership in digital contexts, all with the polished visual fidelity expected from Apple."
