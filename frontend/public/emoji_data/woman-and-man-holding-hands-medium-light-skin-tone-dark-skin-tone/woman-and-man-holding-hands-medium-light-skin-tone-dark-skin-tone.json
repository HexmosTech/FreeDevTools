Apple's characteristic glossy finish and realistic lighting make the skin tones appear natural and the connection feel intimate. The smooth, rounded rendering of their hands, a hallmark of Apple's emoji design, emphasizes unity and partnership. This emoji is commonly used on Apple devices to signify romantic relationships, close friendships, or a strong bond between two individuals."
