  "description": "A hand with the thumb and index finger pinched together, with a light skin tone. Often used to indicate a small amount, emphasis, or a gesture of 'just a little'.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the pinched fingers emoji with a light skin tone forms a delicate gesture, with the thumb and index finger brought close together. Apple's design language gives this emoji a soft, rounded quality and realistic lighting that emphasizes the subtle curves of the fingertips. It visually communicates a sense of 'just a little bit,' precision, or a gentle hint, all conveyed with the polished, tactile feel characteristic of Apple's emoji renderings."
