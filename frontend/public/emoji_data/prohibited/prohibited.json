  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the prohibited symbol is a bold, crimson circle with a diagonal red line across its center, a design that exudes authority and clear restriction. The smooth, glossy finish and subtle 3D rendering give it a distinct presence, emphasizing its universal meaning of 'do not' or 'forbidden.' This emoji is often used on Apple devices to convey warnings, restrictions, or to indicate that something is not allowed or available."
