Its polished surface catches the light with realistic reflections, highlighting Apple's commitment to tactile and detailed design.  The smooth, rounded dome of the pin head and the slender, pointed shaft convey a sense of precision and security, making it ideal for marking locations, pinning ideas, or indicating important notes in your Apple ecosystem."
