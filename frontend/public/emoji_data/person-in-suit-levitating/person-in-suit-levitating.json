  "apple_vendor_description": "The person in a suit levitating emoji on Apple devices presents a whimsical and slightly surreal scene, with a figure in smart business attire hovering gracefully mid-air. Apple's design language emphasizes the crisp lines of the suit and the smooth, almost weightless posture, enhanced by subtle lighting that gives the figure a distinct 3D presence. This emoji is often used to express feelings of elation, being overwhelmed with joy, or a sense of extraordinary accomplishment, all with a touch of playful sophistication."
