  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's ogre emoji presents a fearsome yet somewhat stylized creature, characterized by its green skin, prominent horns, and a stern, unyielding expression. The design on Apple devices employs rich, deep colors and subtle, realistic lighting to give the ogre a tangible, almost mythological presence. Its sharp, angular features are softened by Apple's characteristic rounded edges, making it less overtly terrifying and more of a symbolic representation of something monstrous, difficult, or perhaps even a humorous exaggeration of a challenge in digital communication across Apple devices."
