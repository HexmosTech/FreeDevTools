  "apple_vendor_description": "This captivating emoji on Apple devices presents a face with large, concentric spirals for eyes, rendered in a captivating electric blue hue that seems to hypnotize. The smooth gradients and gentle 3D effect give the face a slightly dazed or mesmerized expression, a hallmark of Apple's expressive character designs. It’s perfectly suited for conveying feelings of being spellbound, disoriented, overwhelmed, or utterly captivated by something."
