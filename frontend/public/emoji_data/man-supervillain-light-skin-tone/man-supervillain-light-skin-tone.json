  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's man supervillain emoji depicts a dramatic figure with an imposing presence, cloaked in dark, flowing attire and often sporting an expression of cunning or power. The glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting on Apple devices accentuate the contours of his mask or helmet, giving him a formidable, almost cinematic appearance. On Apple devices, this emoji is humorously used to represent mischief, a grand scheme, or to playfully adopt an antagonistic persona."
