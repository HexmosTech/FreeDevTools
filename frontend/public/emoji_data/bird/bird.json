  "apple_vendor_description": "The bird emoji on Apple devices is a charming, stylized representation with a smooth, plump body and bright, friendly eyes. Crafted with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting, it appears almost as if it could take flight. Its slightly tilted head and cheerful demeanor suggest a sense of freedom, nature, and cheerful tidings, making it a delightful addition to messages on any Apple device."
