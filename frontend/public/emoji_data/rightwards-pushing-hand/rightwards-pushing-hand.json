  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rightwards pushing hand emoji is designed with a clean, modern aesthetic, featuring smooth, rounded fingers and a palm presented with realistic lighting that gives it a tactile, three-dimensional quality. The skin tone is rendered with subtle gradients and a gentle gloss, conveying a sense of polite but firm action. On Apple devices, this emoji effectively symbolizes pushing forward, making progress, moving something aside, or offering a gentle but decisive 'stop' or 'go' signal."
