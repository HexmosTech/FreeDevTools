Its perfect circular form and smooth, unblemished surface are rendered with Apple's characteristic precision and subtle glossy highlights. This emoji is often used to draw attention to a specific point, signify an important notification, or represent a marker or target, conveying a sense of urgency or emphasis with its clean Apple design."
