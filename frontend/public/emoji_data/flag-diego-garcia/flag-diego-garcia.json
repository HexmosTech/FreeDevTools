  "apple_vendor_description": "The flag of Diego Garcia on Apple devices presents a crisp, vibrant rendition of its naval ensign, featuring a distinctive blue field.  On Apple devices, the flag's fabric appears to ripple slightly, enhanced by Apple's signature soft lighting and subtle 3D shading, giving it a realistic and dignified presence.  This emoji is typically used to represent the British Indian Ocean Territory, travel to the region, or as a specific geographical marker within digital communication."
