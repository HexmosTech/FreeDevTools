  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the face with a medical mask emoji presents a neutral expression peeking out from behind a crisp, clean blue mask. Apple's characteristic realistic lighting and subtle shading give the mask a tangible feel, while the visible eyes convey a sense of caution and concern. This emoji is widely used to represent health, illness, safety precautions, or a general sense of being unwell or needing to protect oneself."
