  "description": "A woman and a man with light skin tone kissing, symbolizing romance, love, and affection between a heterosexual couple.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the kiss between a woman (without explicit skin tone variation) and a man with light skin tone is beautifully rendered with warm hues and a tender, affectionate atmosphere. Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading and soft rounded edges give the couple a smooth, almost sculpted appearance, capturing a moment of intimacy with realistic lighting. This emoji on Apple devices is a clear and heartfelt symbol of romantic love, affection, and close relationships, often used to express passion or a loving sentiment."
