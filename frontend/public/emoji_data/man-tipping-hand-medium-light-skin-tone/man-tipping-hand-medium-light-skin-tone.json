His hand is slightly angled, with soft, rounded contours and a gentle sheen from Apple's realistic lighting, suggesting a nuanced offering or a polite inquiry. This rendering on Apple devices embodies a sense of polite deference, a thoughtful gesture, or a request for something in a subtle and friendly manner."
