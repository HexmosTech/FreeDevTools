Apple's design language brings a sense of smooth texture and realistic lighting to the wheelchair itself, emphasizing its functional form with subtle highlights. The person's posture appears upright and engaged, embodying independence and accessibility, a thoughtful representation of mobility and participation on Apple devices."
