  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the orange heart emoji radiates a warm, inviting hue, reminiscent of a sunset or a ripe citrus fruit, with a lustrous, almost translucent quality. Apple’s meticulous 3D shading and soft gradients give it a plump, rounded appearance and a delightful, tactile feel. This emoji, with its unique autumnal or energetic tone, is often used to express enthusiasm, friendship, or a more nuanced form of affection than the classic red heart."
