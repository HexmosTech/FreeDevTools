  "description": "<p>A wand with sparkles (✨<em>magic</em>✨) coming out of its end. Most platforms show a classic magician-style magic wand that&#39;s black with white tips. WhatsApp shows a golden magic wand tipped with a star, similar to the wand that Glenda the Good Witch uses in the 1939 film <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the magic wand emoji is rendered with a polished wooden handle and a gracefully curved tip, from which a cascade of golden sparkles emanates with a soft glow. Apple's signature 3D shading and realistic lighting lend a playful yet sophisticated touch to its design, suggesting the power of imagination and the creation of something wonderful. This emoji is commonly used to convey wishes, excitement, or the feeling of making something appear effortlessly through digital communication on Apple devices."
