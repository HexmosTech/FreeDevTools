  "description": "<p>A brown beaver with buckteeth and a wide paddle-like tail. Can be used in the context of actual beavers, or metaphorically to evoke qualities of beavers like working hard, as in the expression <em>beavering away</em>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commonly associated with Canada, as beavers are a national emblem of the country. May also be used in reference to the vagina, which is an informal sense of the word <em>beaver</em>.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The beaver emoji on Apple devices is a charming and industrious creature with a distinct, glossy sheen. Its fur is rendered with subtle shading, and its iconic flat tail is depicted with a realistic texture, all enhanced by Apple’s smooth gradients and soft rounded edges. This beaver embodies hard work, determination, and building, making it a fitting symbol for industrious projects, perseverance, or even a playful nod to someone being exceptionally busy."
