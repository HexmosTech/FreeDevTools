  "apple_vendor_description": "This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, features a man with a medium-light skin tone, his arm raised enthusiastically with his hand open, conveying eagerness and participation. Apple's design language imbues the figure with a friendly, approachable posture and smooth, rounded edges, while realistic lighting emphasizes the gentle curve of his arm and the clear outline of his hand. It's commonly used to express wanting to ask a question, volunteering for a task, or showing excitement in a group setting."
