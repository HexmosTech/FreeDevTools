  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s headstone emoji is presented with a somber, respectful reverence, featuring a clean, upright stone with a gently rounded top. Realistic lighting and soft gradients on Apple devices lend it a dignified, almost weathered appearance, evoking feelings of remembrance and reflection. This emoji is often used to acknowledge loss, pay tribute to someone who has passed, or mark a significant, often final, event."
