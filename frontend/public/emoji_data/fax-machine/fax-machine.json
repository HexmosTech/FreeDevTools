  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's fax machine emoji offers a retro yet functional representation of communication technology. It features a slightly aged, off-white casing with distinct buttons and a slot, all rendered with Apple's hallmark realistic lighting and subtle 3D depth. On Apple devices, it evokes nostalgia and the reliable transmission of documents, symbolizing official correspondence or a connection to older communication methods."
