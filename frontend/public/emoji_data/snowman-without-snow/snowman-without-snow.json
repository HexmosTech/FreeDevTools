  "apple_vendor_description": "The snowman without snow emoji on Apple devices offers a whimsical and slightly melancholic visual, characterized by Apple's smooth gradients and soft rounded edges. This solitary figure, lacking its snowy foundation, is depicted with a friendly, if slightly forlorn, expression, complete with button eyes and a carrot nose. On Apple devices, it’s a charming way to express a desire for winter, a longing for cold weather, or a playful nod to unusual circumstances."
