  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the computer disk emoji showcases a classic floppy disk with a meticulously rendered label area and a prominent metal hub. Its design is elevated with Apple's signature 3D shading and realistic lighting, giving it a slightly raised, substantial feel. This emoji evokes nostalgia for early computing or is used metaphorically to represent saving, data storage, or a backup, all rendered with the smooth, rounded aesthetic characteristic of Apple's interface."
