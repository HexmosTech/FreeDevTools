  "description": "A woman and a man with medium skin tones kissing, symbolizing romance, love, and affection between a heterosexual couple.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this romantic emoji depicts a tender kiss between two figures, rendered with Apple's signature smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges. The woman, with a pale complexion, leans in gently, her eyes closed in affection, while the man, presented with a medium skin tone, reciprocates the embrace with a warm, subtle expression.  This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, beautifully captures a moment of intimacy and connection, often used to convey love, romance, and deep affection in digital conversations."
