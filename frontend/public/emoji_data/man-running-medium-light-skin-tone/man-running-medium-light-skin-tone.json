His pose is athletic, with limbs captured in mid-stride, highlighted by Apple's expert use of glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting that emphasizes musculature.  The smooth gradients and soft rounded edges contribute to its energetic yet approachable appearance, often employed to represent exercise, speed, or a burst of activity in messages."
