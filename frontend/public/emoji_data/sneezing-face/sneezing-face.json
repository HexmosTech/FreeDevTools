A prominent, glistening droplet flies from the nose, a testament to Apple's commitment to realistic visual storytelling through its emoji.  The overall effect, enhanced by Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, suggests a strong bout of illness or an overwhelming burst of emotion, making it a vivid and relatable communication tool on Apple devices."
