The detailed uniform, complete with helmet and jacket, benefits from Apple's realistic lighting and smooth gradients, giving it a polished, three-dimensional appearance. On Apple devices, the soft rounded edges and subtle highlights contribute to its approachable yet heroic portrayal, making it a powerful symbol for bravery, rescue, and community service in messages."
