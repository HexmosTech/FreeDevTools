The woman without a skin tone modifier and the woman with a medium skin tone lean towards each other, their cheeks gently touching, symbolizing affection and romance. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting create a warm, intimate glow, emphasizing the connection and love shared between them, making it a beautiful representation of same-sex relationships and heartfelt sentiment."
