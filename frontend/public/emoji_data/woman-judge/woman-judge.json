  "apple_vendor_description": "The woman judge emoji on Apple devices embodies authority and fairness with a distinguished presence. She is depicted wearing a traditional robe, rendered with Apple’s characteristic glossy 3D shading that gives the fabric depth and texture, while realistic lighting highlights the stern yet impartial expression on her face. This emoji, with its smooth gradients and soft rounded edges, is commonly used to represent legal proceedings, justice, or the concept of judgment."
