  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the person pouting emoji captures a distinct expression of displeasure with a subtle downturned mouth and slightly furrowed brow, rendered in Apple's signature glossy 3D style. The realistic lighting emphasizes the soft, rounded edges of the face, conveying a sense of mild sulkiness or disappointment. This emoji is perfect for expressing minor frustrations or when feeling a bit miffed in digital conversations on Apple devices."
