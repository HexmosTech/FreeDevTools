The wheelchair itself is depicted with smooth, rounded details, and the person's posture is upright and engaged, reflecting independence and mobility. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is a powerful symbol of disability inclusion, accessibility, and personal empowerment, fostering understanding and representation in digital communication."
