  "description": "A hand pointing to the left, with a medium-light skin tone. Used to indicate direction, to draw attention to something on the left, or to express a negative or dismissive sentiment.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the leftwards hand emoji with medium-light skin tone is rendered with a naturalistic, soft-rounded form and subtle 3D shading.  Its surface boasts realistic lighting, casting gentle shadows that highlight its smooth contours and lifelike texture.  This gesture, distinctively presented on Apple devices, conveys direction, emphasis, or a polite signal to move left, often used to guide attention or indicate a choice in digital conversations."
