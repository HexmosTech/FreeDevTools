Its surface boasts realistic lighting, casting gentle shadows that highlight its smooth contours and lifelike texture.  This gesture, distinctively presented on Apple devices, conveys direction, emphasis, or a polite signal to move left, often used to guide attention or indicate a choice in digital conversations."
