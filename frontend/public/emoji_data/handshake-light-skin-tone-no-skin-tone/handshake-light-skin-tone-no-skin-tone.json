The hands, rendered with a light skin tone and devoid of explicit skin tone modifiers in this variation, are shown clasped firmly, with Apple's signature soft rounded edges and subtle highlights suggesting a warm and welcoming connection.  The overall impression is one of unity and partnership, making it a universally understood symbol for making deals, forging alliances, or confirming understanding in digital communications on Apple devices."
