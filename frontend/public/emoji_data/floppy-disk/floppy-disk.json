  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the floppy disk emoji presents a nostalgic yet functional icon, rendered with a classic beige casing and a dark gray or black insert. The 3D shading on Apple devices gives it a subtle depth, making it appear as a tangible object from a bygone era of data storage. Its clean lines and soft rounded edges are characteristic of Apple's design, evoking feelings of archiving, saving, or referring to older technologies in digital communication."
