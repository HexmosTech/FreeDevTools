  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman detective emoji is depicted with a keen and focused expression, exuding an aura of intelligence and determination. She wears a classic trench coat, rendered with Apple's signature soft, rounded edges and subtle 3D shading that suggests a realistic fabric texture. Her posture is poised and observant, often holding a magnifying glass, symbolizing investigation, mystery, and the pursuit of truth in digital conversations."
