  "apple_vendor_description": "The supervillain emoji on Apple devices, presented with a medium-dark skin tone, is a dramatically rendered character with a menacing yet captivating presence.  Its design features sharp, angular lines combined with Apple's signature soft rounded edges on elements like the mask or cape, creating a visually intriguing contrast.  Realistic lighting and deep, rich shading add a sense of power and mystery to this figure, often used humorously to represent a playful, over-the-top, or even slightly mischievous persona in online interactions."
