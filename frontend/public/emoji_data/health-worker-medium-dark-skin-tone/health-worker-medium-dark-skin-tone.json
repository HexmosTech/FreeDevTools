  "apple_vendor_description": "The health worker emoji on Apple devices, rendered with a medium-dark skin tone, stands with a professional and compassionate demeanor.  A subtle gloss and realistic lighting emphasize the crisp white of their scrubs and the reassuring blue of a stethoscope draped around their neck, showcasing Apple's signature 3D design.  Their gentle, almost imperceptible smile conveys empathy and dedication, making this emoji a perfect symbol of care, healing, and gratitude for medical professionals across Apple's ecosystem."
