  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the couple with heart emoji portrays two figures, one with medium-light skin tone and the other with medium skin tone, linked by a vibrant red heart that glows with Apple‚Äôs signature 3D glossiness. The gentle curvature of the figures and the soft, diffused lighting emphasize their connection and the warmth of their bond. This beautifully rendered emoji on Apple devices perfectly symbolizes love, partnership, and deep affection between two individuals."
