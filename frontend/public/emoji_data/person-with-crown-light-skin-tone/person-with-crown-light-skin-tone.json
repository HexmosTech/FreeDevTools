  "description": "A person wearing a golden crown, signifying royalty, authority, or a position of high status. It can also be used playfully to indicate feeling like a king or queen.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The Person with Crown emoji, in its light skin tone variant on Apple devices, presents an aura of authority and nobility.  Rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, the golden crown sits regally atop the head, catching the light with a polished gleam.  The emoji's smooth gradients and carefully sculpted features convey a sense of leadership, achievement, or a playful declaration of being the 'best,' frequently used to celebrate a success or acknowledge someone's impressive status."
