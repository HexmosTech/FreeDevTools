  "apple_vendor_description": "The anguished face emoji on Apple devices presents a deeply emotional expression, with wide, tear-filled eyes and a downturned, trembling mouth rendered with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and subtle shading. Its 3D design lends a tangible sense of distress, capturing the weight of sorrow or overwhelming sadness with realistic lighting that casts gentle shadows. This emoji, as depicted on Apple devices, is a powerful way to communicate intense emotional pain, despair, or profound upset."
