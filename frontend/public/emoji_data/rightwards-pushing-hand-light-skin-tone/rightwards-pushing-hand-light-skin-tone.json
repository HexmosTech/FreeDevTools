Its palm is slightly curved inward, showcasing Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and soft rounded edges, giving it a gentle yet firm appearance. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, effectively conveys a sense of stopping, holding back, or a polite 'halt' in digital conversations, often used to create a pause or signal disagreement."
