  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the breast-feeding emoji, depicted with medium-light skin tone, portrays a tender and nurturing moment with gentle realism. The mother figure is rendered with soft, rounded edges and subtle gradients that highlight her caring posture, while the baby is shown with a peaceful expression. Apple's characteristic realistic lighting imbues the scene with warmth and a sense of intimate connection, commonly used to celebrate motherhood, new life, or the bond between parent and child."
