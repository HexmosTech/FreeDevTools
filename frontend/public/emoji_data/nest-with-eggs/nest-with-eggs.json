  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's nest with eggs emoji is a charming depiction of nature's bounty, featuring a softly woven nest with realistically rendered eggs nestled within its comforting embrace. On Apple devices, the texture of the twigs and straw is subtly defined through detailed shading and smooth gradients, giving it a tactile feel. The eggs themselves possess a delicate sheen, hinting at new life and beginnings, making this emoji a symbol of family, hope, and nurturing on Apple devices."
