  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man tipping hand emoji with a medium skin tone is depicted with a graceful, open palm held upwards, conveying a sense of polite greeting or gentle offering. Apple's design language imbues this emoji with a subtle, realistic sheen and smooth, rounded edges, making the hand appear both friendly and approachable. Its relaxed posture and the subtle curvature of the fingers, typical of Apple's detailed character renderings, often symbolize a casual 'hello,' a welcoming gesture, or a humble request for attention within digital communication."
