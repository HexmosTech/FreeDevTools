  "description": "A couple composed of a man and a person (gender unspecified) kissing, with the man having medium-light skin tone. Represents romantic affection between a man and another person.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "This emoji on Apple devices showcases a man’s face with closed eyes and a soft, closed-mouth smile, embodying a tender and affectionate kiss. The medium-light skin tone is artfully shaded with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and subtle, lifelike lighting, lending it a warm and inviting appearance.  The perfectly rounded edges of the face and the delicate 3D effect create a gentle and loving sentiment, frequently used to send a kiss or express warm affection within messages on Apple devices."
