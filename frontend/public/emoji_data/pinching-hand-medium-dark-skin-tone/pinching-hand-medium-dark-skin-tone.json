  "description": "A hand with the thumb and index finger pinched together, often used to indicate a small amount, a precise measurement, or a subtle gesture. The medium-dark skin tone specifies the skin color.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The pinching hand emoji on Apple devices, rendered in a medium-dark skin tone, displays a precise and deliberate gesture with its thumb and index finger brought close together. Apple's characteristic soft rounded edges and realistic lighting make the skin texture appear natural and the hand‚Äôs form subtly three-dimensional. This emoji often conveys a sense of 'just a little bit,' a subtle emphasis, or even a sarcastic 'you don't say?' in Apple-centric digital communication."
