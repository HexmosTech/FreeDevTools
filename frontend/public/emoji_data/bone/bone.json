  "apple_vendor_description": "The bone emoji on Apple devices is rendered with a clean, white, and slightly curved form, showcasing Apple's signature realistic lighting that gives it a smooth, almost polished appearance. Its simple, rounded edges and subtle shading create a tactile feel, evoking concepts of health, nourishment, or even a playful 'digging in' to a topic. This emoji is often used humorously or in discussions related to pets, health, or satisfying a craving within Apple's intuitive interface."
