  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s rendering of women holding hands, depicted with medium-dark and light skin tones, conveys a strong sense of camaraderie and connection through its soft, rounded edges and naturalistic lighting. Their hands are shown clasped, with subtle shading that highlights the gentle texture and form, characteristic of Apple’s 3D design language. This emoji is a versatile symbol for friendship, support, solidarity, or shared journeys, presented with the approachable and inclusive visual style Apple is known for."
