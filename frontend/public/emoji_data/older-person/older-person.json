  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the older person emoji is rendered with gentle, warm tones, showcasing a friendly face with subtle wrinkles that convey wisdom and experience. The realistic lighting and soft, rounded edges on Apple’s depiction give this emoji a reassuring and approachable presence. It’s commonly used to represent grandparents, elders, or to signify a sense of maturity and respect in digital conversations."
