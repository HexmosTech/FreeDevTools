  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the supervillain emoji embodies pure, theatrical menace with a striking visual flair. Its design features a dramatic, dark costume often accented with bold, contrasting colors and a menacing mask or helmet, all rendered with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading that gives it a tangible, almost comic-book-like presence. The expression, if visible, is typically stern or sinister, conveying a sense of mischief, power, or perhaps a playful acknowledgment of overwhelming odds, making it a fun and evocative choice for expressing dramatic situations or a feeling of being unstoppable on Apple devices."
