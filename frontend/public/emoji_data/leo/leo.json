  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the Leo emoji is a majestic depiction of the lion, rendered with a rich, golden-brown mane that radiates strength and pride. Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting give the lion a powerful, almost regal presence. This emoji, with its soft rounded edges and dynamic posture, symbolizes courage, leadership, and the zodiac sign of Leo, often used to convey confidence or a bold spirit."
