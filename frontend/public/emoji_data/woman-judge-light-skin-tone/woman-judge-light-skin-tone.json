Her light skin tone is rendered with subtle highlights, and the subtle curve of her head implies thoughtful consideration, while the iconic gavel rests nearby, hinting at impartiality and justice.  This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is a powerful symbol of fairness, authority, and legal proceedings."
