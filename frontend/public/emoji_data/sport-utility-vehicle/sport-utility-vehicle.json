  "description": "<p>A blue or green Sport Utility Vehicle or station wagon, often with a spare tire on the back. Commonly used as a generic blue or green car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sport Utility Vehicle</em> or <em>SUV</em> is an emoji whose meaning was likely lost in translation as it moved from Japanese phone carriers to the Unicode Standard in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This emoji goes back to the late 1990s when it was <a href=\"/docomo/1999/sport-utility-vehicle/\">included in Docomo&#39;s emoji set</a>. In 2009, it appeared on a <a href=\"https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2009/09026r-emoji-proposed.pdf\">proposal</a> as one of many symbols available on Japanese phones recommended to be encoded into the Unicode Standard. In that proposal, the symbol was referred to as a &quot;recreational vehicle&quot; or RV. The original Japanese emojis look more like station wagons or SUVs than RVs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At various points, platforms including Google and Samsung showed this emoji as an RV, but ultimately the designs across platforms converged to a car that looks more like an SUV or station wagon. At a small scale this emoji is barely distinguishable from <a href=\"/automobile/\">🚗 Automobile</a> on some platforms.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The sport utility vehicle emoji on Apple devices is depicted as a modern, robust SUV with a sleek, glossy finish and bold, rounded lines. Realistic shadows and highlights give it a substantial, tangible presence, often used to represent travel, adventure, or a journey, suggesting readiness for any road ahead."
