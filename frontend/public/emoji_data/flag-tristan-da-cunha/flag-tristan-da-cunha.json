  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple renders the flag of Tristan da Cunha with crisp detail, featuring a deep blue ensign adorned with the Union Jack in the canton and the island's coat of arms.  The coat of arms, with its shield and seabirds, is depicted with Apple's signature realistic lighting and subtle glossy shading, giving it a sense of depth and importance.  This unique flag emoji, with its smooth, rounded edges, signifies origins, travel, or a connection to this remote South Atlantic island."
