  "apple_vendor_description": "The olive emoji on Apple devices presents a single, ripe olive, rendered with a deep, lustrous green color and a subtle sheen that highlights its smooth, plump shape. Apple's characteristic 3D shading and realistic lighting give it a tactile quality, suggesting its natural texture. This emoji, with its distinctively rendered appearance on Apple devices, is often used to represent Mediterranean cuisine, healthy eating, or as a symbol of peace and tranquility."
