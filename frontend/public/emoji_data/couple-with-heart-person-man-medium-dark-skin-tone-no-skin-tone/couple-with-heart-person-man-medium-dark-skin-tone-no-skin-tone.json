  "apple_vendor_description": "Represented on Apple devices with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and polished 3D shading, this emoji captures a connection between a man and a person, both presented with inclusive representation. The man is shown with a medium-dark skin tone, while the other figure is rendered without a specific skin tone, allowing for broader interpretation. A luminous, glossy red heart floats between them, signifying affection, romance, and the universal language of love, rendered with the distinctive warmth Apple is known for."
