  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this emoji depicts a tender kiss between a man and a woman with distinct skin tones, rendered with Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading and soft, rounded edges. The man’s face, presented without a specific skin tone, leans in towards the woman, whose medium-toned skin is subtly highlighted by realistic lighting, conveying a sense of affection and romantic connection. The smooth gradients and polished appearance on Apple devices make this emoji a warm and intimate representation of a romantic moment or a loving gesture shared between partners."
