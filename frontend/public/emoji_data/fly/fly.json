  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's fly emoji depicts a common housefly rendered with a metallic sheen and detailed wing texture, showcasing Apple's commitment to realistic lighting and glossy 3D shading. The small, dark body and transparent wings are meticulously crafted with soft, rounded edges, giving it a surprisingly detailed yet universally recognizable form. On Apple devices, this emoji often conveys annoyance, a sense of something being bothersome, or can be used humorously to represent something small and irritating."
