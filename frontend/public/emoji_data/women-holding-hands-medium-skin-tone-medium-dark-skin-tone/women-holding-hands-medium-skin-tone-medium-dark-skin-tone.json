  "description": "Two women with medium and medium-dark skin tones holding hands, symbolizing friendship, romance, or solidarity.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the two women holding hands, depicted with a medium skin tone and a medium-dark skin tone, beautifully represent connection, partnership, and diversity. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading gives their joined hands a lifelike texture and warmth, while the smooth gradients on their skin tones are rendered with subtle realism. This emoji, with its soft rounded edges and gentle lighting, is a powerful symbol of friendship, romance, solidarity, or shared experiences between women."
