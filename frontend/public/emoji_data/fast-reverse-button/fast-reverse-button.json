  "apple_vendor_description": "The fast reverse button emoji on Apple devices is a sleek, dark icon with a subtle 3D effect, appearing as if pressed into a glossy surface. Its sharp, clean lines and precise curves are characteristic of Apple's user interface design, providing a clear visual cue for rewinding content. On Apple devices, this emoji is instinctively understood to mean going back, reversing playback, or undoing an action in digital communication."
