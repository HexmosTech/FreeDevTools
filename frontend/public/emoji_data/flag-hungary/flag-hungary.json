  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the flag of Hungary is depicted with its bold horizontal tricolor of red, white, and green, each band exhibiting a smooth, matte finish with subtle depth. Apple's rendering employs realistic lighting to give the flag a sense of form and weight, without harsh shadows, and its soft rounded edges contribute to its dignified presentation. This emoji, representing Hungary with clarity and national pride, is a clear and recognizable symbol for communication."
