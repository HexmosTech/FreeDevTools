  "apple_vendor_description": "Appleâ€™s sewing needle emoji features a slender, sharp implement with a precisely defined eye, rendered with exquisite detail and a touch of metallic sheen. Realistic lighting and 3D shading on Apple devices highlight its fine point and the smooth curve of the thread passing through its eye, creating a sense of delicate craftsmanship. This emoji, representing sewing, mending, or creation, brings an artisan touch and a feeling of precision to messages on Apple devices."
