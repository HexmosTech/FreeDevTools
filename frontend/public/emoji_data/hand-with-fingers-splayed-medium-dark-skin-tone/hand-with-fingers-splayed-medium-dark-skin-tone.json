Appleâ€™s signature smooth shading and soft rounded edges give this gesture a welcoming and approachable feel, capturing the nuance of stopping or saying 'talk to the hand'. It's a versatile emoji for indicating a pause, disagreement, or simply holding up five, all rendered with Apple's characteristic tactile depth."
