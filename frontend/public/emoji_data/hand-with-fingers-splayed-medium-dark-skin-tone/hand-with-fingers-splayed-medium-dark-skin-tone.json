  "description": "A hand with all five fingers spread open, often used to indicate 'stop', 'talk to the hand', or a five-count. The medium-dark skin tone specifies the complexion.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The medium-dark skin tone hand with fingers splayed on Apple devices is depicted with a warm, rich complexion and a confident, open posture. Apple‚Äôs signature smooth shading and soft rounded edges give this gesture a welcoming and approachable feel, capturing the nuance of stopping or saying 'talk to the hand'. It's a versatile emoji for indicating a pause, disagreement, or simply holding up five, all rendered with Apple's characteristic tactile depth."
