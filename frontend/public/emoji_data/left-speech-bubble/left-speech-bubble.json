  "apple_vendor_description": "The left-pointing speech bubble on Apple devices is a crisp, clean design, rendered with subtle 3D depth and smooth gradients that make it appear almost tangible. Its soft, rounded corners and distinct tail point purposefully to the left, indicating a thought or statement originating from the left side of a conversation. This emoji, as seen on Apple’s screens, is perfect for signifying dialogue, ideas, or a response within digital exchanges."
