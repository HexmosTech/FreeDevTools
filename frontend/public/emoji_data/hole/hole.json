  "apple_vendor_description": "This hole emoji on Apple devices is a striking depiction of negative space, rendered with deep, shadowy depths that create a strong sense of three-dimensionality. Its edges are softly rounded with subtle highlights, giving it a smooth, almost polished appearance despite its emptiness. It visually communicates a void, a missing piece, or a point of entry, often used humorously to signify something has disappeared or to express a feeling of being lost or incomplete."
