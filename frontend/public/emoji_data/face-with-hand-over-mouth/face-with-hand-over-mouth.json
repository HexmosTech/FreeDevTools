  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the face-with-hand-over-mouth emoji displays a bright yellow face with wide, startled eyes and a hand gently covering its mouth, conveying a sense of shock, disbelief, or a suppressed gasp. The realistic lighting and soft, rounded edges on Apple devices enhance the emotional nuance, making the expression feel genuinely surprised or amused. This emoji is ideal for reacting to unexpected news, a funny mishap, or something so shocking it leaves you speechless."
