Apple‚Äôs signature 3D shading creates a subtle metallic sheen on the knuckles and fingers, giving it a polished and professional appearance. The smooth gradients and realistic lighting suggest trust and a successful partnership, making it ideal for confirming deals or expressing strong mutual respect in digital conversations."
