  "apple_vendor_description": "This romantic emoji, rendered with Apple's vibrant color palette and glossy 3D effect, depicts a man with a medium skin tone leaning in to kiss a woman with a dark skin tone, their lips nearly touching. On Apple devices, the soft curvature of their faces and the gentle blush tones communicate affection and intimacy with a touch of warmth. It's a beautiful representation of love and connection, uniquely detailed by Apple's design language for expressing tender moments."
