  "description": "An older person with a medium-light skin tone, commonly used to represent a grandmother, elder, or figure of wisdom.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendering of the older person with a medium-light skin tone features a kindly face, framed by soft, wispy white hair, all presented with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting. The gentle smile and relaxed posture, enhanced by smooth gradients on their clothing, evoke a feeling of wisdom, experience, and warmth, making them approachable and reassuring. On Apple devices, this emoji is often employed to represent grandparents, mentors, or anyone embodying seasoned knowledge and a caring spirit."
