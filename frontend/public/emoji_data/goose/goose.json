  "apple_vendor_description": "The goose emoji on Apple devices presents a stately and somewhat proud avian figure, rendered with smooth, white plumage that catches the light, showcasing Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting. Its distinctive S-shaped neck and alert posture, characterized by soft, rounded edges, give it a recognizable and slightly imposing presence. This charmingly detailed emoji on Apple’s platform often symbolizes nature, rural settings, or a feeling of being ruffled or slightly annoyed, conveying a distinct personality."
