On Apple devices, he wears a dark robe, subtly textured and highlighted with Apple's characteristic realistic lighting to convey depth and gravitas. The judge's face, rendered with smooth gradients and soft rounded edges, appears wise and authoritative, with furrowed brows and a firm set to his lips, suggesting fairness and impartiality. This emoji is ideal for discussions about justice, law, decisions, or when seeking a sense of authority and finality in digital communication."
