  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the canned food emoji presents a classic cylindrical can with a neatly pulled tab on top, finished with realistic metallic sheen and subtle highlights. Its smooth, rounded edges and clear labeling design, even if generic, evoke a sense of sustenance and preparedness. This emoji, often appearing in a muted silver or white, signifies provisions, emergency supplies, or a simple meal on Apple devices."
