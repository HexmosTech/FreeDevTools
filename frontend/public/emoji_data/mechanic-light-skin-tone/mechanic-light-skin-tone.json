The design features Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading, giving the tools and clothing a tactile, polished appearance with realistic lighting that emphasizes their form and texture. With soft rounded edges and a determined expression, this emoji on Apple devices is perfect for communicating about repairs, car maintenance, or the trades."
