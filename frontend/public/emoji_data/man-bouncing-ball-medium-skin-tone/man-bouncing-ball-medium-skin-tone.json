  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this emoji depicts a man with a warm, medium skin tone engaged in a dynamic action, his arm raised and poised to bounce a vibrant, glossy ball. Apple’s signature 3D shading imbues the figure with a sense of movement and realism, with smooth gradients highlighting his athletic build and the playful curve of his pose. The ball itself boasts a subtle sheen, hinting at its bouncy texture, and the overall impression on Apple devices is one of energetic fun and active recreation."
