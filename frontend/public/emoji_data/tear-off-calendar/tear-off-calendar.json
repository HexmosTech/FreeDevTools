  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the tear-off calendar emoji is depicted as a crisp, white page hanging precariously from a spiral binding, with a corner dramatically peeled back. Apple's realistic lighting and subtle shadows give it a sense of depth and tangibility, while its soft rounded edges ensure a smooth aesthetic. This emoji powerfully signifies the passage of time, deadlines, important dates, or the feeling of a day or event having just passed."
