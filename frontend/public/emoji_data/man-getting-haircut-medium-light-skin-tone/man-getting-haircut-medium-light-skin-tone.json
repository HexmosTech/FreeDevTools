  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man getting a haircut emoji depicts a figure with medium-light skin tone, rendered with Apple's signature smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges. A pair of scissors, artfully shaded with realistic lighting, hovers near his hair, suggesting a precise and gentle trim. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, conveys a sense of transformation, self-care, or a fresh start, often used in conversations about personal grooming or significant changes."
