Apple's signature realistic lighting creates a warm glow, highlighting the smooth, rounded edges that convey a sense of nurturing and anticipation. This inclusive emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is a modern representation of parenthood and family, used to express joy, empathy, or personal experiences related to pregnancy and new beginnings."
