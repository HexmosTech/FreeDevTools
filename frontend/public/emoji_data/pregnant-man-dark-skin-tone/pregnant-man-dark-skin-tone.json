  "description": "A man who is pregnant, represented with a dark skin tone. This emoji acknowledges gender diversity in pregnancy and can symbolize a journey into fatherhood or parenthood.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The pregnant man emoji, rendered in a rich, dark skin tone on Apple devices, showcases a subtly rounded belly with soft, three-dimensional shading that suggests gentle fullness. Apple's signature realistic lighting creates a warm glow, highlighting the smooth, rounded edges that convey a sense of nurturing and anticipation. This inclusive emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is a modern representation of parenthood and family, used to express joy, empathy, or personal experiences related to pregnancy and new beginnings."
