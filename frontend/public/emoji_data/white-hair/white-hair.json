  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the white hair emoji is rendered with delicate, flowing strands that capture the essence of wisdom and experience. Apple's signature smooth gradients and soft rounded edges create a gentle, luminous effect, suggesting silver or pure white tones with subtle shading for a realistic, touchable appearance. This emoji evokes a sense of age, seniority, and the passage of time, often used to represent elders or acknowledge someone's mature perspective."
