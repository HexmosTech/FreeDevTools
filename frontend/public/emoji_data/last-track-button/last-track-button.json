  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the last track button emoji is a sleek, minimalist icon rendered with a polished, metallic sheen and subtle 3D depth. Its form is clean and precise, featuring a distinct triangular arrow pointing left, enclosed within a vertical bar, all with softly rounded edges typical of Apple’s design language. This intuitive symbol clearly signifies a desire to rewind or return to the previous item in a playlist or sequence, offering a seamless user experience."
