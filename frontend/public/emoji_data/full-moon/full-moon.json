  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the full moon emoji is a mesmerizing celestial body, rendered with breathtaking realism and a soft, ethereal glow. Its surface is a tapestry of subtle craters and maria, sculpted by Apple's sophisticated 3D shading and realistic lighting techniques, creating a palpable sense of depth. The smooth gradients and gentle highlights evoke a sense of mystery, tranquility, and the vastness of the night sky, often used on Apple devices to convey nighttime, wonder, or a sense of completeness."
