  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's multiply emoji is a bold, geometric 'X' designed with a deep, solid black color and subtle, rounded edges that feel soft to the touch. The realistic lighting on Apple devices gives it a slight dimensionality, making it stand out clearly against any background. This emoji functions as a clear indicator of multiplication in mathematical contexts or can be used on Apple devices to signify 'no,' 'cancel,' or to cross out an item in a list, conveying a definitive negation."
