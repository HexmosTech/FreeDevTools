  "apple_vendor_description": "The person in a steamy room emoji on Apple devices depicts a figure with a light skin tone, partially obscured by a soft, diffused mist that suggests warmth and relaxation. Subtle highlights and shadows, achieved through Apple's realistic lighting and smooth gradients, create an intimate and serene atmosphere around the individual. This emoji, unique to Apple's design, is often used to convey a sense of unwinding, self-care, or a moment of tranquil escape."
