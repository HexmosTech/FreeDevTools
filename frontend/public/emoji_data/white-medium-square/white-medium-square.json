  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the white medium square emoji presents a clean, crisp geometric shape with a subtle, almost matte finish.  Its perfectly aligned sides and soft, rounded corners evoke a sense of order and clarity, a hallmark of Apple's minimalist aesthetic.  This versatile symbol, with its understated elegance on Apple devices, can be used to represent spaces, boundaries, or simply as a neutral visual element in digital compositions."
