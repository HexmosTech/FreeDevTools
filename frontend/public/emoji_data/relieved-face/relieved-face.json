  "apple_vendor_description": "The relieved face emoji on Apple devices radiates a gentle sense of ease and comfort, with soft, rounded eyes and a subtly smiling mouth that conveys a sigh of relief. Its smooth, pearlescent skin tone, enhanced by Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and soft highlights, makes the expression feel genuinely heartfelt. This emoji is perfect for communicating that a stressful situation has passed, a burden has been lifted, or simply to express a feeling of contentment and relaxation after a challenge."
