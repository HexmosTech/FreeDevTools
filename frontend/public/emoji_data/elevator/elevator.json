  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the elevator emoji is depicted as a sleek, modern cabin with its doors partially open, inviting entry or exit. Apple’s signature realistic lighting and glossy 3D shading give the metallic surfaces and subtle interior details a polished and almost tangible quality. This emoji often symbolizes transitions, movement between different levels or stages, and progress, frequently used in contexts related to career advancement, personal growth, or simply navigating the ups and downs of life."
