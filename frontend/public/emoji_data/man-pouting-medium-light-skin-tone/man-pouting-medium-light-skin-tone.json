  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man pouting emoji portrays a man with a medium-light skin tone, his lips turned down in a clear expression of displeasure or disappointment. Apple's design language imbues this emoji with soft, rounded edges and a gentle, yet distinct frown, making the emotion immediately recognizable without being overly harsh. The subtle shading and realistic lighting highlight the downturned corners of his mouth and the slight furrow in his brow, effectively conveying a mood of mild discontent or a playful sulk in messages exchanged on Apple devices."
