  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's large-brown-square emoji is a solid, richly colored block with a subtle glossy sheen that gives it a tactile, almost material quality, a hallmark of Apple's 3D design.  Its perfectly square form and even shading create a sense of stability and groundedness.  This emoji, as it appears on Apple devices, can represent earth, natural materials, or a foundational element, and is often used in contexts related to nature, stability, or when a simple, strong visual block is needed."
