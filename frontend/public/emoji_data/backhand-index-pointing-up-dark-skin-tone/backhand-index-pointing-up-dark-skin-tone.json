  "description": "This version of the  Backhand Index Pointing Up emoji has the  Dark Skin Tone applied, which is displayed as a Black Skin Tone on suppor",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the backhand index pointing up emoji, depicted in a deep, dark skin tone, features a meticulously rendered hand with naturalistic curves and a glossy finish. The index finger is sharply defined, pointing decisively upwards, with subtle highlights that give it a palpable dimensionality, a hallmark of Apple's design. This emoji on Apple devices is commonly used to draw attention to something above, indicate agreement, or offer a clear direction within a digital conversation."
