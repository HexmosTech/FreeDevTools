  "description": "This version of the  Backhand Index Pointing Right emoji has the  Medium-dark Skin Tone applied, which is displayed as a Dark Brown Skin",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the backhand index pointing right emoji, presented with a medium-dark skin tone, is a bold and clear directional indicator with Apple's signature polished finish. The finger is sharply defined with a smooth, rounded tip and subtle highlights, conveying a sense of assertive directionality enhanced by realistic lighting that gives it a tactile, almost three-dimensional presence. This emoji, with its precise rendering, is exceptionally useful for guiding attention, suggesting a next step, or emphasizing a particular item or piece of information on Apple devices."
