  "apple_vendor_description": "The last quarter moon face emoji on Apple devices presents a serene and introspective countenance, bathed in the soft glow of moonlight. Its surface is rendered with Apple's characteristic subtle 3D shading, creating a palpable sense of depth and texture. The gentle curve of the crescent moon is perfectly depicted, with a calm, almost knowing expression that evokes feelings of quiet reflection, mystery, or the winding down of a day."
