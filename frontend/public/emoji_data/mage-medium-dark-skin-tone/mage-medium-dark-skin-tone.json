He is depicted with flowing robes rendered in rich, deep colors, accentuated by Apple's signature glossy 3D shading that suggests texture and movement.  Holding a glowing staff or orb, the realistic lighting effects cast an ethereal glow, making this emoji a perfect representation of magic, fantasy, and the pursuit of knowledge or enchantment in messages."
