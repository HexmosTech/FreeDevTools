  "description": "<p>An icy-blue face with gritted teeth usually depicted with icicles clinging to its cheeks or jaw, as if frozen from extreme cold. May also represent unfriendliness (slang, <i>cold</i>) or excellence (slang, <i>cool</i> or <i>chill</i>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple&rsquo;s design features the same expression as its <a href=\"/grimacing-face/\">😬 Grimacing Face</a>. Huawei&#39;s design has a chipped <a href=\"/tooth\">🦷 Tooth</a>.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the cold face emoji vividly conveys a frosty chill with its pale blue complexion and chattering teeth. Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading adds a subtle sheen to the skin, while the soft rounded edges of the face and subtle wrinkles around the eyes enhance its expressive realism. This emoji is perfect for communicating feelings of being freezing, unwell, or experiencing a significant drop in temperature, all rendered with Apple's characteristic warmth and clarity."
