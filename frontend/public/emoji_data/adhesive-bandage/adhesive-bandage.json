  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the adhesive bandage emoji appears as a clean, white strip with a soft, rounded corner and a gentle, subtle curve, reflecting Apple's meticulous design for clarity and ease of recognition. Realistic lighting highlights its slightly raised texture, suggesting a comforting and healing presence. This emoji is commonly employed to indicate injury, recovery, or offering support and care."
