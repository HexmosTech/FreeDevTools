  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the mantelpiece clock emoji is a classic representation with a polished wooden casing and a prominent, ornate face.  Its detailed Roman numerals and elegant hands are rendered with realistic lighting and soft, rounded edges, projecting a sense of timelessness and tradition.  This emoji, with its gentle glow and sophisticated design on Apple devices, is frequently used to signify time passing, appointments, or the urgency of a deadline."
