  "apple_vendor_description": "This Apple emoji portrays a person with a deep, rich skin tone, rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and soft, rounded edges. Their eyebrows are noticeably furrowed, creating a distinct downward curve that conveys a palpable sense of displeasure or disappointment, a subtle yet effective expression in digital communication on Apple devices.  The realistic lighting accentuates the contours of their face, making the frown appear genuine and relatable."
