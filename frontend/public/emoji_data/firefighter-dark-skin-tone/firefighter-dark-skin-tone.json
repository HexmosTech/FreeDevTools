  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the firefighter emoji with a dark skin tone is depicted in a dynamic pose, wearing a sturdy helmet and uniform, rendered with Apple's detailed 3D shading and realistic textures. The uniform appears robust, and the overall design conveys strength and bravery through its confident posture and subtle highlights. This emoji is a powerful symbol of courage, heroism, and dedication to public service, especially when used in contexts honoring first responders on Apple devices."
