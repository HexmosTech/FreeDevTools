On Apple devices, it features a distinct, slightly raised appearance with precise, sharp edges and subtle shading that gives it a professional and authoritative feel. The smooth, polished surface, typical of Apple's design language, ensures it stands out clearly, signifying official registration and brand protection in digital correspondence."
