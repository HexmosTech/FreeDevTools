  "apple_vendor_description": "The kiss: woman, person emoji on Apple devices is beautifully rendered with a medium-dark skin tone, featuring a soft, rounded face with a gentle, closed-mouth kiss gesture. Apple's characteristic glossy shading gives the lips a plump, inviting appearance, and the subtle blush on the cheeks, enhanced by realistic lighting, adds a touch of tender affection. This emoji is commonly used to express love, romance, or a warm, affectionate greeting."
