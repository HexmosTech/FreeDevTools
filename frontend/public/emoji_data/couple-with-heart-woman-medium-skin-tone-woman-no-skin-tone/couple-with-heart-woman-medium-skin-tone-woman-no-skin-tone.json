The figures are rendered with Apple's signature soft rounded edges and a gentle 3D effect, creating a warm and inclusive visual. The glossy finish on the heart and the subtle lighting on the figures convey a strong sense of romance, partnership, and affection, making it a powerful symbol for LGBTQ+ relationships and love in all its forms on Apple devices."
