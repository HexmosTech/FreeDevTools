  "apple_vendor_description": "The wavy dash emoji on Apple devices appears as a fluid, dark gray line with a gentle, undulating curve, offering a distinctly organic feel. Its smooth gradient and subtle shading give it a tactile quality, suggesting a pause, a connection, or a transition in thought within digital text. This unique Apple rendering adds a nuanced visual element to convey subtle shifts in meaning."
