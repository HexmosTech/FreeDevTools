  "apple_vendor_description": "The person facepalming emoji on Apple devices features a medium-dark skin tone and is depicted with an exaggerated gesture of utter disbelief or exasperation, the hand pressed firmly against the forehead. Apple's signature glossy shading and subtle lighting create a sense of humorous despair, with soft, rounded facial features that convey a universal feeling of 'I can't believe this is happening.' It's a perfect way to express frustration, embarrassment, or a moment of overwhelming realization in digital conversations."
