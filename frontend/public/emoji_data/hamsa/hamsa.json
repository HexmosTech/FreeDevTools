  "description": "<p>A blue hand with an eye in the center of the palm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hamsa is an ancient symbol important to multiple religions including Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and Christianity. It represents luck, protection, guidance, feminine power, and faith, among other meanings.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The Hamsa emoji on Apple devices is elegantly designed as a stylized hand, often depicted in a serene blue or white hue, radiating a sense of protection and good fortune. Apple’s signature 3D shading and subtle gloss give it a polished, almost amulet-like appearance, with smooth, rounded edges that feel welcoming. On Apple devices, this emoji is commonly used to ward off negative energy, invoke blessings, or express a desire for safety and prosperity in digital communications."
