Their faces are gently curved with soft, rounded edges, and the subtle blush on their cheeks conveys a sense of affection and intimacy. This emoji, appearing with medium and light skin tones on Apple devices, is commonly used to add a romantic or affectionate closing to a message, signifying a close bond."
