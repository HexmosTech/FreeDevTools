The design on Apple devices often includes a hint of realistic lighting that makes the carton appear almost tangible, evoking a sense of thirst-quenching refreshment and convenience. This emoji is commonly used to represent drinks like juice, milk, or other beverages, perfect for discussions about snacks or hydration."
