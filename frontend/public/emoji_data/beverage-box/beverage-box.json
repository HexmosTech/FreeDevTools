It can also be used metaphorically to talk about power, energy, respect, or an elusive quality that makes someone special.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While intended to be used to represent a broad selection of juices and other liquids, most vendors&#39; designs feature a&nbsp;<a href=\"/red-apple\">🍎 Red Apple</a> symbol.&nbsp;<a href=\"/grapes\">🍇&nbsp;Grapes</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"/tangerine\">🍊Tangerine</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"/peach\">🍑 Peach</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"/cherries\">🍒&nbsp;Cherries</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"/pear\">🍐 Pear</a>, and a&nbsp;<a href=\"/sun-with-face\">🌞 Sun with Face</a> across other more distinct designs.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's beverage box emoji presents a familiar, stylized carton with a subtle gloss and soft, rounded corners, suggesting a refreshing drink inside. The design on Apple devices often includes a hint of realistic lighting that makes the carton appear almost tangible, evoking a sense of thirst-quenching refreshment and convenience. This emoji is commonly used to represent drinks like juice, milk, or other beverages, perfect for discussions about snacks or hydration."
