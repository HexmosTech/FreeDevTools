  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man standing emoji with a medium skin tone appears poised and ready, his form rendered with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and realistic lighting that gives him a subtle, three-dimensional presence. His posture is upright and confident, with soft rounded edges on his clothing and features, suggesting approachability and a neutral yet present stance. This versatile emoji, as seen on Apple devices, represents a person, an individual, or a general presence, often used to indicate someone is present, participating, or simply observing."
