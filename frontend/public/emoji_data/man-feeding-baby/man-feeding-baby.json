  "description": "<p>A man feeding a baby with a bottle, sometimes looking down to the infant and smiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This emoji supports skin tone modifiers, which apply to the adult. The head of the baby is recommended to be hidden to avoid a situation where the skin tone of the baby would only correlate to the skin tone of the adult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Variants include <a href=\"/person-feeding-baby/\">🧑&zwj;🍼 Person Feeding Baby</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"/woman-feeding-baby/\">👩&zwj;🍼 Woman Feeding Baby</a>.&nbsp;See also&nbsp;<a href=\"/breast-feeding/\">🤱&nbsp;Breast-Feeding</a>.</p>",

The father, rendered with Apple's signature smooth gradients and soft rounded edges, cradles a baby, offering a bottle with subtle, warm lighting that emphasizes the tender moment. This emoji on Apple devices conveys care, parenthood, and the act of nurturing, often used to express familial love or the joys of raising a child."
