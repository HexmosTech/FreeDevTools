The person, depicted with smooth, rounded features and soft gradients, sits calmly as a pair of scissors, rendered with realistic lighting and a metallic sheen, snip away at their hair. This emoji, with its subtle expression and clear action, represents transformation, self-care, or a fresh start, all brought to life with Apple's signature 3D design."
