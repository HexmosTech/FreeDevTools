Apple's signature glossy 3D shading adds a subtle sheen, making it appear almost tangible and inviting. Its understated design and soft, rounded edges convey a feeling of comfort and a nod to culinary traditions, often used to represent snacks, light meals, or Japanese cuisine in conversations on Apple devices."
