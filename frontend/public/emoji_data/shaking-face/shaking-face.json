  "apple_vendor_description": "The shaking face emoji on Apple devices captures a feeling of utter disbelief or overwhelming emotion with its vividly rendered, slightly distorted facial features. Its eyes are wide, its mouth agape, and a subtle, almost imperceptible tremor is conveyed through the smooth gradients and realistic lighting that suggest a body being shaken with intense feeling. This emoji, with its characteristic Apple polish, is ideal for expressing shock, surprise, or when something is so unbelievable it has to be seen to be processed."
