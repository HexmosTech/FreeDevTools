  "description": "<p>A face that appears to be shaking from side to side with its eyes and mouth open wide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This emoji finds its origins in the comic book and cartoon trope of a shaking face. It can be used to express shaking from external forces like earthquakes, loud noises, or dinosaurs walking nearby. It can also be used to express shaking caused by strong emotions such as shock, fear, confusion, disbelief, anticipation, and excitement. Additionally it can represent dizziness, double takes,&nbsp;or double vision.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The shaking face emoji on Apple devices captures a feeling of utter disbelief or overwhelming emotion with its vividly rendered, slightly distorted facial features. Its eyes are wide, its mouth agape, and a subtle, almost imperceptible tremor is conveyed through the smooth gradients and realistic lighting that suggest a body being shaken with intense feeling. This emoji, with its characteristic Apple polish, is ideal for expressing shock, surprise, or when something is so unbelievable it has to be seen to be processed."
