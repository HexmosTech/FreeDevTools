  "apple_vendor_description": "The kiss emoji on Apple devices features a woman’s face rendered with a soft, medium-dark skin tone and a gentle, closed-mouth smile, conveying a sense of tenderness.  Her cheeks are subtly flushed, highlighted by Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting, giving the impression of a warm, affectionate gesture.  The smooth gradients and rounded edges contribute to its approachable and endearing appearance, perfect for sending a sweet peck or a loving sentiment in a message."
