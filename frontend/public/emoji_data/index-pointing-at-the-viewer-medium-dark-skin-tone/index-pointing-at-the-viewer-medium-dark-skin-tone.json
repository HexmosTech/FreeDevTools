Apple's characteristic realistic lighting and subtle shading create a lifelike appearance, emphasizing the nail and the slight curves of the finger with soft rounded edges. It's a dynamic emoji used to draw attention, give direction, or make a direct address to the recipient in messages, embodying Apple's commitment to inclusive representation and clear visual cues."
