  "apple_vendor_description": "The Fast Down Button emoji on Apple devices is rendered as a sleek, dark gray downward-pointing arrow encased within a softly rounded square.  Its 3D design emphasizes a subtle gloss and realistic lighting, giving it a tangible feel as if ready to be pressed.  On Apple's platform, this emoji clearly conveys an action of accelerating descent or rapidly moving content downwards, perfect for indicating quick scrolling or downloads."
