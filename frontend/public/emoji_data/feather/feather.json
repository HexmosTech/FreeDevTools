Its wispy barbs are depicted with subtle gradients and smooth, rounded edges, capturing the lightness and natural beauty of a bird's plume. On Apple devices, this emoji evokes feelings of peace, freedom, gentleness, and inspiration, often used to convey a sense of lightness or a soft touch in digital conversations."
