  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the beaming face with smiling eyes emoji expresses pure, unadulterated joy, its cheeks flushed with a rosy glow and its eyes crinkled in a wide, genuine smile. Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading gives the face a plump, almost tactile appearance, with highlights that suggest a radiant inner happiness and soft, rounded edges that enhance its friendly demeanor. This emoji, with its overwhelmingly positive visual cues and warm, inviting expression, is the quintessential way to convey extreme delight, excitement, or profound satisfaction on Apple devices."
