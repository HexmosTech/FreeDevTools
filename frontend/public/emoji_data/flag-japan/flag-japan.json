  "apple_vendor_description": "The flag of Japan emoji on Apple devices displays a striking crimson circle representing the sun against a pristine white background. Apple's design renders this iconic emblem with a subtle sheen and perfectly smooth curves, giving the circle a luminous quality that appears to emanate light. The crispness of the white field and the vibrant red of the sun, enhanced by Apple's realistic lighting, make this emoji a clear and respectful representation. It's commonly used to signify Japan, Japanese culture, travel to the country, or to express national pride."
