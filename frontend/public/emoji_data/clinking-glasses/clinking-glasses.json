Each glass gleams with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, reflecting light with a sophisticated sparkle, and the effervescent bubbles within hint at festivity. The smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges of the glasses convey a sense of polished elegance and joyful connection, making it an ideal emoji for toasting successes, celebrating milestones, or sharing in moments of good cheer on Apple devices."
