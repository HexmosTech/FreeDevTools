  "description": "<p>An open&nbsp;right hand facing right, so as to show the back of the hand with the thumb on the top and the pinky on the bottom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This emoji was developed along with <a href=\"/leftwards-hand/\">🫲 Leftwards Hand</a> to allow for the creation of <a href=\"/zero-width-joiner/\">ZWJ Sequences</a> that depict <a href=\"/handshake/\">🤝 Handshake</a>&nbsp;with two different skin tone modifiers applied, one to each hand.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the rightwards hand emoji is rendered with a clean, open palm facing right, subtly shaded with Apple's hallmark glossy 3D effect and smooth gradients. The realistic lighting casts gentle shadows, giving the hand a tactile and inviting feel with softly rounded edges. This emoji, appearing on Apple devices, is a dynamic symbol for direction, progression, and moving forward, often used to indicate a path, agree with a statement, or point towards something to the right."
