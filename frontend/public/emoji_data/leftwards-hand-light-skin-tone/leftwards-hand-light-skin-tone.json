  "description": "A hand pointing to the left with a light skin tone. Used to indicate direction, draw attention to something on the left, or as a subtle gesture of disagreement or dismissal.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The leftwards pointing hand emoji in a light skin tone, as seen on Apple devices, is rendered with a clean, smooth design and subtle 3D shading that gives it a tactile quality. Its fingers are elegantly posed, indicating direction or a subtle nudge towards something to the left, all within Apple's signature style of soft rounded edges and realistic lighting. This emoji is frequently used to guide attention, suggest a leftward movement, or simply add a directional flourish to digital conversations on Apple products."
