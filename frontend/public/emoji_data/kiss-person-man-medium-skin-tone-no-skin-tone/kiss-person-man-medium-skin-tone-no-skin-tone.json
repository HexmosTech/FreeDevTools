  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the kiss person (man) emoji, with a medium skin tone, radiates tender affection with its characteristic glossy 3D shading and lifelike rendering. The man's face, viewed on Apple devices, is tilted slightly, with closed eyes and pursed lips, conveying a gentle, heartfelt kiss. The soft gradients and realistic lighting bring a sense of intimacy and warmth to the expression, making it a classic choice for expressing love, romance, or a sweet farewell."
