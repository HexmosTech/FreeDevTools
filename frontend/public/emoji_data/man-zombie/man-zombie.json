  "apple_vendor_description": "The Man Zombie emoji on Apple devices presents a somewhat unsettling yet stylized figure, with pale, greenish skin and vacant, dark eyes that possess Apple's signature soft lighting.  Its tattered clothing and slightly hunched posture are rendered with subtle gradients and rounded edges, hinting at a classic undead archetype without being overly graphic.  This emoji is commonly used to convey a feeling of being drained, overwhelmed, or utterly exhausted, often in a humorous or dramatic context within Apple communications."
