  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the gloves emoji presents a pair of cozy, knitted mittens rendered in a soft, warm beige color. Apple’s signature 3D shading gives them a plush, rounded appearance, with subtle highlights suggesting a soft texture and inviting warmth. These gloves on Apple devices are perfect for conveying a sense of comfort, protection from the cold, or a readiness for winter activities."
