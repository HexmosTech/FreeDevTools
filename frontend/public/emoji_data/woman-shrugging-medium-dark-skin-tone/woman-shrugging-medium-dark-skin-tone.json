  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman shrugging with a medium-dark skin tone conveys a sense of amiable uncertainty, rendered with Apple's signature soft rounded edges and gentle 3D shading. Her shoulders are raised in a classic gesture of \"I don't know,\" her palms facing upwards with subtle, realistic lighting that highlights the smooth gradients of her skin and clothing. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is perfect for expressing a lack of knowledge or a feeling of being unsure in a lighthearted, approachable manner."
