The figure is rendered with Apple‚Äôs characteristic 3D shading and soft, rounded edges, emphasizing the casual posture and open palms that convey a sense of 'I don't know' or 'what can you do?'. This versatile emoji is commonly used to express a lack of knowledge, a carefree attitude, or a shrug of resignation in digital conversations."
