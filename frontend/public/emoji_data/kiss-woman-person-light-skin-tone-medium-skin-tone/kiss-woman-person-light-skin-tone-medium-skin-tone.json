  "apple_vendor_description": "The kiss emoji on Apple devices showcases a woman leaning in with her eyes closed and lips puckered, her light to medium skin tone rendered with Apple’s characteristic smooth gradients and realistic lighting. The soft rounded edges of her face and hair, combined with a subtle blush, create an intimate and tender visual. This emoji on Apple devices is a sweet and affectionate way to convey love, romance, or a fond farewell, adding a personal touch to messages."
