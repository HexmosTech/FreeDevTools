  "apple_vendor_description": "The flag of South Korea on Apple devices is a vibrant and precisely rendered emblem, showcasing the iconic Taegeuk symbol in its bold red and blue against a clean white background. Apple's design language brings out the crispness of the flag's stripes and the smooth curvature of the Taegeuk, with realistic lighting that gives it a subtle, almost fluttering appearance. This emoji is a clear and proud representation of South Korean nationality and culture, often used to express national pride or connection."
