  "description": "This version of the  Middle Finger emoji has the  Medium-dark Skin Tone applied, which is displayed as a Dark Brown Skin Tone on support",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the middle finger emoji with a medium-dark skin tone is depicted with a bold, upward gesture, its form rendered with smooth, rounded contours and subtle shading that gives it a palpable presence. The fingernail is clearly defined, and the overall design possesses a distinct, slightly rebellious energy, typical of Apple's expressive character renderings. This emoji is often used to convey defiance, sarcasm, or a strong, albeit impolite, sentiment, delivered with a universally understood visual language on Apple devices."
