Apple's signature glossy 3D shading gives the lips a plump, inviting appearance, while realistic lighting adds a soft glow to the cheeks. The smooth gradients and soft rounded edges of their features convey a gentle, loving gesture, symbolizing romance, endearment, or a sweet farewell, perfect for adding a touch of intimacy to messages."
