Apple's design uses soft, diffused lighting and subtle gradients to capture the misty atmosphere, with smooth, rounded edges on the figure for a sense of relaxation and calm. This emoji is commonly used to evoke feelings of rejuvenation, spa experiences, self-care, or simply a moment of peaceful unwinding."
