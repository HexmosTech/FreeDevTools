  "apple_vendor_description": "The flag of Montserrat on Apple devices is depicted with vibrant colors and a crisp, detailed rendering that speaks to Apple’s commitment to visual accuracy. Its soft, slightly curved appearance, typical of Apple’s emoji design, gives it a tangible quality, as if gently waving in a breeze. The national emblem is clearly visible, making this emoji a distinct representation for discussions about travel, geography, or the Caribbean nation, all presented with the polished aesthetic of Apple’s interface."
