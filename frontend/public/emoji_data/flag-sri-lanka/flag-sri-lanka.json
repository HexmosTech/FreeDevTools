Apple's design elevates the flag with glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients, showcasing the rich maroon field, the golden lion, and the distinctive green and saffron stripes. Realistic lighting gives it a sense of depth and movement, as if it's gently waving, making it a clear and respectful symbol of Sri Lankan identity and heritage for use in communications."
