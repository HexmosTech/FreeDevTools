  "apple_vendor_description": "The sloth emoji on Apple devices embodies a state of serene leisure, its fuzzy, light brown fur meticulously detailed with soft shading and subtle highlights. Its large, dark eyes gaze out with a placid, almost dreamy expression, perfectly capturing the creature's famously unhurried nature. Hanging from a gentle, curved branch with its characteristic long claws, this emoji on Apple devices is ideal for conveying a desire for relaxation, a slow pace, or a need for a break."
