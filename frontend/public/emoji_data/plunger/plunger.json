  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s plunger emoji showcases a bold, bright red suction cup atop a sturdy, dark wooden handle, rendered with characteristic 3D gloss and depth. The smooth, rounded edges of the rubber cup and the realistic wood grain on the handle give it a tangible feel, synonymous with Apple's attention to detail. This emoji on Apple devices is commonly used to humorously signify a problem, a mess, or the need to 'unclog' a situation, adding a touch of lightheartedness to messages."
