  "description": "The Woman Shrugging, Type-4 emoji is a sequence of the  Shrug,  Emoji Modifier Fitzpatrick Type-4, ? Female Sign and ? Variation Selecto",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The woman shrugging emoji on Apple devices features a woman with a medium skin tone, her shoulders raised and palms turned upwards in a universally recognized gesture of uncertainty or indifference. Apple's signature smooth gradients and soft rounded edges contribute to a friendly and approachable depiction, while realistic lighting emphasizes the subtle tilt of her head and the slight frown of her mouth, conveying a sense of amiable bewilderment or a polite 'I don't know.' This emoji is perfect for expressing a lack of knowledge, a shrug of resignation, or a playful admission of not having the answer in digital conversations on Apple devices."
