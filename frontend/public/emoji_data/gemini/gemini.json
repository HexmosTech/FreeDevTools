  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the Gemini emoji is represented by two intertwined figures, a classic artistic depiction symbolizing the duality and versatility of the sign. Apple's design imbues these figures with a sense of harmonious balance, using soft rounded edges and subtle shading to highlight their connection. This emoji, rendered with the characteristic Apple sheen, is frequently used to represent people born under the Gemini zodiac sign, or to signify a dual nature, adaptability, and lively communication."
