Apple's signature glossy 3D shading lends a realistic texture and depth to the skin, with subtle highlights reflecting the light. The soft, rounded edges of the fingers convey a sense of connection and agreement, making it a perfect symbol for collaboration, partnership, and mutual respect in digital conversations."
