  "apple_vendor_description": "This handshake emoji on Apple devices showcases two hands, one with a medium-dark skin tone and the other with a dark skin tone, clasped firmly together. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading lends a realistic texture and depth to the skin, with subtle highlights reflecting the light. The soft, rounded edges of the fingers convey a sense of connection and agreement, making it a perfect symbol for collaboration, partnership, and mutual respect in digital conversations."
