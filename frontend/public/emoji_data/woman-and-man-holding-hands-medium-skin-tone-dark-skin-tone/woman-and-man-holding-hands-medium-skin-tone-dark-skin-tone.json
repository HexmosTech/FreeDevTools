Apple's design language emphasizes smooth gradients and realistic lighting on their clasped hands, creating a tactile sense of togetherness. The gentle curves and soft shading of their intertwined figures convey warmth, partnership, and shared affection, making it a powerful symbol of relationships and solidarity."
