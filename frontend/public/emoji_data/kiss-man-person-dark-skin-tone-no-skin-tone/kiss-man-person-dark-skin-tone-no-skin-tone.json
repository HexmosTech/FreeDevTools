  "description": "Represents a kiss between a man and a person with dark skin tone, conveying affection, love, and romance. It signifies intimacy and a close relationship.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "This emoji, as rendered on Apple devices, depicts a man with a rich, dark skin tone leaning in for a kiss, his eyes closed in a gesture of affection.  Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading imbues the figure with a soft, rounded appearance, making the lips slightly puckered and the overall form inviting.  The subtle, realistic lighting on Apple's design enhances the romantic and tender sentiment, commonly used to convey love, passion, or a sweet farewell in digital conversations."
