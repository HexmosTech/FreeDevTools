  "apple_vendor_description": "The page with curl emoji on Apple devices depicts a crisp, white document page elegantly curving at its upper right corner, a classic visual motif rendered with Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading. The smooth gradient and subtle shadow suggest depth and realism, evoking the feeling of important information, a filed record, or a significant announcement ready to be shared."
