  "description": "<p>A reddish-orange face with furrowed eyebrows, tongue stuck out, and beads of sweat, as if overheated from high temperatures. Number and position of sweat droplets vary by platforms. May also represent physical attractiveness (slang, <i>hot</i>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most platforms feature expressions that are variations on <a href=\"/anxious-face-with-sweat/\">😰 Anxious Face With Sweat</a> or <a href=\"/sad-but-relieved-face/\">😥 Sad but Relieved Face</a>. &nbsp;</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The hot face emoji on Apple devices presents a person with a flushed, red complexion and a bead of sweat trickling down their forehead, all rendered with Apple’s characteristic glossy 3D shading and expressive detail. Their eyes are slightly squinted, and their mouth is open in a gasp, conveying intense heat or discomfort with soft, rounded edges that enhance the visual drama. This emoji effectively communicates feeling overheated, exhausted, or dealing with a challenging, sweltering situation, all within Apple's clear and intuitive visual style."
