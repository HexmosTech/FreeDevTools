  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the deaf person emoji features a stylized figure with a light skin tone, depicted with a clear, forward-facing posture and a subtle, understanding expression. The emoji's clean lines and soft, realistic lighting emphasize inclusivity and the act of non-verbal communication, reflecting Apple's commitment to accessible design. It symbolizes understanding without spoken words, the ability to connect through other senses, or can be used to represent individuals within the deaf community."
