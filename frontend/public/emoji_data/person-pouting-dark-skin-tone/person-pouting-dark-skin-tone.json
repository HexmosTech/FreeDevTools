  "description": "This version of the  Person Pouting emoji has the  Dark Skin Tone applied, which is displayed as a Black Skin Tone on supported platform",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the person pouting emoji with a dark skin tone captures a moment of mild displeasure or disappointment with a distinct downturned mouth. The glossy 3D shading and soft rounded edges give the expression a relatable and slightly exaggerated quality, typical of Apple's expressive emoji set.  This emoji is commonly used to convey a feeling of being unimpressed, sulky, or playfully upset in digital conversations, all with Apple's characteristic visual charm."
