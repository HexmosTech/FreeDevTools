  "description": "<p>A zebra, a horse-like mammal with black-and-white stripes. Variously depicted in full profile on all fours facing left or as a&nbsp;zebra head facing left with a short mane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not to be confused with <a href=\"/horse/\">🐎 Horse</a>. Some vendors implement a similar face as their <a href=\"/horse-face/\">🐴 Horse Face</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple, Microsoft, WhatsApp, Samsung, and Facebook&rsquo;s designs feature the full animal; Google and Twitter&#39;s&nbsp;designs feature a head with a short mane and black muzzle. Facebook&rsquo;s design <a href=\"/facebook/2.1/zebra/\">previously</a> featured only a zebra head, as did <a href=\"/samsung/one-ui-1.0/zebra/\">Samsung&#39;s</a>.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the zebra emoji gallops with bold black and white stripes that pop against a clean background, all rendered with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D aesthetic. Its form is slightly rounded and smooth, reflecting realistic lighting to create a sense of playful movement. This majestic creature, depicted with a friendly yet wild spirit, often symbolizes uniqueness, nature, or a touch of the exotic in digital conversations on Apple devices."
