  "description": "<p>A woman feeding a baby with a bottle, sometimes looking down to the infant and smiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This emoji supports skin tone modifiers, which apply to the adult. The head of the baby is recommended to be hidden to avoid a situation where the skin tone of the baby would only correlate to the skin tone of the adult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Variants include <a href=\"/person-feeding-baby/\">🧑&zwj;🍼 Person Feeding Baby</a> and <a href=\"/man-feeding-baby/\">👨&zwj;🍼 Man Feeding Baby</a>.&nbsp;See also&nbsp;<a href=\"/breast-feeding/\">🤱&nbsp;Breast-Feeding</a>.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman feeding baby emoji portrays a tender moment with a warm, soft glow. The mother, rendered with Apple’s signature smooth gradients and rounded edges, gently cradles her infant, whose delicate features are softly illuminated. This emoji beautifully captures the nurturing bond and parental love, frequently used to express themes of family, caregiving, and new life in digital communication."
