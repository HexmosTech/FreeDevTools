  "apple_vendor_description": "The handshake emoji, featuring a medium-dark skin tone and a medium skin tone, appears on Apple devices with a warm, collaborative spirit. Apple's characteristic realistic lighting brings out the subtle textures of the hands, while the glossy 3D shading gives the clasp a reassuring, substantial feel. The clean lines and soft rounded edges of the fingers convey a genuine sense of agreement, trust, and partnership, making it an ideal symbol for sealing a deal or expressing mutual respect in digital communication."
