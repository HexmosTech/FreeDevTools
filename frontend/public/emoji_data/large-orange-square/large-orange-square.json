  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's large orange square emoji is a vibrant and uniformly colored geometric shape, presented with a subtle, almost imperceptible glossy sheen that catches the light. Its perfectly straight edges and smooth surface, characteristic of Apple's clean design language, give it a modern and digital feel.  On Apple devices, this emoji can be used to highlight important information, create visual dividers, or simply add a pop of bright, cheerful color to digital communications."
