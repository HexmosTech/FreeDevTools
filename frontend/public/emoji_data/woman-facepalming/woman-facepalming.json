  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman facepalming emoji captures a moment of exasperation with striking clarity, her hand gently covering her forehead and eyes. Apple's characteristic soft rounded edges and realistic lighting lend a palpable sense of her relatable frustration or disbelief. The subtle blush on her cheeks and the slight downturn of her mouth, all rendered with Apple's smooth gradients, convey a universal feeling of 'I can't believe this' or 'oh dear.'"
