  "description": "Represents a man with a beard and light skin tone. Often used to depict men, masculinity, or to add a specific detail to a man.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "This distinguished gentleman on Apple devices sports a warm, light skin tone and a meticulously rendered beard that adds a touch of gravitas.  Apple's signature 3D shading gives the beard texture and depth, while realistic lighting accentuates the subtle contours of his face.  His expression, often neutral or slightly thoughtful, conveys maturity and experience, making him ideal for representing men in various professional or personal contexts."
