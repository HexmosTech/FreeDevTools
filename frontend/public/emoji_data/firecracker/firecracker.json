Also applied to&nbsp;figurative senses of <a href=\"/fire/\"><em>fire</em></a>, e.g., slang <i>hot</i>, <i>on fire</i>&nbsp;(&ldquo;excellent&rdquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it may resemble a stick of dynamite on some platforms, several vendor designs, such as Google and Twitter&#39;s,&nbsp;suggest the emoji is modeled after traditional Chinese firecrackers, as are strung together and lit on such occasions as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year\">Chinese New Year</a>.</p>",
