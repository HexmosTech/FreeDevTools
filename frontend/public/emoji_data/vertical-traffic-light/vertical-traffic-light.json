  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the vertical traffic light emoji stands tall and sleek, showcasing its iconic red, yellow, and green lights rendered with a subtle, glossy 3D effect. The smooth gradients of the housing and the distinct glow of each illuminated signal are hallmarks of Apple’s attention to realistic lighting and detail. This emoji, with its crisp, rounded edges, is commonly used to signify waiting, caution, or the process of decision-making, mirroring the familiar sight of traffic signals on any Apple-powered journey."
