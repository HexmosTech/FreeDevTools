  "apple_vendor_description": "This emoji on Apple devices depicts a man with a calm, neutral expression, his head tilted slightly as if receiving a service. The rendering showcases Apple's signature attention to detail, with realistic hair strands and subtle shadows that give depth to the scene. The haircutting scissors are depicted with a polished silver finish, symbolizing transformation, rejuvenation, or a fresh start in personal style."
