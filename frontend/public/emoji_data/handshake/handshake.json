  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's handshake emoji presents two hands meeting in a firm, welcoming gesture, rendered with a warm, medium skin tone and Apple’s signature 3D shading that gives them a palpable sense of texture and depth. The realistic lighting and soft, rounded edges on the fingertips convey a feeling of trust, agreement, and successful collaboration. This iconic symbol of unity and positive resolution feels especially polished and approachable on Apple devices."
