  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the head shaking horizontally emoji depicts a face with its eyes closed and a subtle downturn of the mouth, conveying a clear negative response or disagreement. Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and soft rounded edges give the expression a nuanced and relatable quality. This emoji is a direct and universally understood way on Apple devices to communicate 'no,' disapproval, or disbelief, often used in digital conversations to signal a firm stance."
