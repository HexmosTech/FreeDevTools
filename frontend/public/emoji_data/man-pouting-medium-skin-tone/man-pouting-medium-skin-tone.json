  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's 'man pouting' emoji, rendered in a pleasant medium skin tone, captures a moment of mild discontent with characteristic charm.  His lips are subtly turned downwards, and his brow might be slightly furrowed, all conveyed with Apple's signature soft rounded edges and smooth, realistic shading that gives him a tactile feel.  This emoji, with its gentle 3D lighting, effectively communicates a feeling of being displeased, slightly sulky, or playfully disappointed in a way that is relatable and endearing on Apple devices."
