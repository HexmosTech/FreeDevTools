  "description": "This version of the  Index Pointing Up emoji has the  Dark Skin Tone applied, which is displayed as a Black Skin Tone on supported platf",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the index-pointing-up emoji with a dark skin tone is a strong, decisive gesture, its pointer finger extended upwards with a sharp, clear outline. Apple's characteristic realistic lighting and glossy finish give the hand a natural, polished look, conveying emphasis, direction, or a point of importance. This emoji is frequently used to draw attention to something above, highlight a key item, or signify agreement and affirmation."
