  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the palm-up hand emoji with a light skin tone is rendered with delicate detail, featuring soft, rounded fingers and a gently curved palm that appears open and welcoming. The realistic lighting and subtle glossy finish, characteristic of Apple's design, give this emoji a sense of generosity and receptiveness. It is frequently used to offer something, ask a question, express prayer or hope, or signify an open invitation, all with Apple's characteristic clarity and warmth."
