The realistic lighting and subtle glossy finish, characteristic of Apple's design, give this emoji a sense of generosity and receptiveness. It is frequently used to offer something, ask a question, express prayer or hope, or signify an open invitation, all with Apple's characteristic clarity and warmth."
