  "description": "A man is depicted kneeling on one knee, with a medium light skin tone. This emoji often signifies prayer, respect, apology, or a proposal.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The man kneeling emoji on Apple devices presents a figure in a medium-light skin tone, captured in a moment of thoughtful repose. His form is rendered with Apple's signature smooth gradients and soft rounded edges, emphasizing a gentle, natural posture. Realistic lighting subtly highlights the contours of his folded leg and upright torso, conveying a sense of humility, prayer, or deep contemplation."
