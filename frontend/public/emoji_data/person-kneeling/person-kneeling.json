  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s kneeling person emoji portrays an individual in a stable, grounded pose, with smooth, rounded limbs and realistic lighting that emphasizes their form. The kneeling posture can convey a range of emotions, from prayer and supplication to rest or preparation for action, all rendered with the polished aesthetic inherent in Apple’s emoji design. It offers a visual representation of humility, deep thought, or a moment of quiet contemplation."
