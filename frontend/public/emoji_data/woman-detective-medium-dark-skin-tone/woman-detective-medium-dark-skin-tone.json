  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman detective with a medium-dark skin tone is portrayed with an air of mystery and intelligence. She's often depicted in classic detective attire, perhaps with a trench coat or a magnifying glass, rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D effect and precise detail. The realistic lighting highlights her focused expression, while the soft rounded edges of her form make her approachable yet authoritative. This emoji is perfect for communicating about investigations, secrets, or a sharp, investigative mind."
