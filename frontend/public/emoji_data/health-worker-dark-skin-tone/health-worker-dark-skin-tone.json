The figure wears a crisp white coat, symbolizing professionalism, while subtle highlights on the fabric and a gentle sheen on the skin convey a sense of warmth and approachability. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is a powerful representation of frontline workers and those in the medical field, often used to express gratitude or support."
