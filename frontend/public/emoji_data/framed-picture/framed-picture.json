  "apple_vendor_description": "The framed picture emoji on Apple devices presents a classic rectangular frame with soft, rounded corners, giving it a polished and modern aesthetic. Within the frame, a subtle, abstract image is suggested through Apple's signature smooth gradients and realistic lighting, hinting at a memory, artwork, or a cherished moment. This versatile emoji, often used to share visual memories, art, or to refer to a specific photograph or illustration, adds a touch of personal significance to messages sent on Apple devices."
