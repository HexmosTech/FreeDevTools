Apple's signature glossy shading and soft, rounded edges create a sense of warmth and closeness, making the bond between them palpable.  The subtle highlights and realistic lighting emphasize the texture of their skin and the gentle pressure of their grip, symbolizing unity, support, and diverse relationships, making it a powerful tool for expressing love, alliance, or shared experiences."
