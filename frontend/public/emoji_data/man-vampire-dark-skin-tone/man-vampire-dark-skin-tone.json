  "description": "A man depicted as a vampire, typically with fangs, dark clothing, and an often pale complexion. It can represent the supernatural, the night, or a character with a mysterious or dangerous allure.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the dark skin tone vampire emoji cuts a striking figure with a dramatic, flowing cape and a piercing gaze, all rendered with Apple's distinctive glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting. The character's sharp features and the deep, rich tones of their attire are emphasized by the smooth gradients and soft rounded edges characteristic of Apple's design language. This emoji, embodying mystery, allure, and a touch of the supernatural, is perfect for conveying a playful spooky vibe or a sense of dark fascination in conversations."
