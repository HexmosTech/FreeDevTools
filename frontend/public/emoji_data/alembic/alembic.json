  "description": "<p>An apparatus for distilling, as used in medieval <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy\">alchemy</a>. Generally depicted as a round flask with a neck angled down to the right. Positioned on a short stand and containing a mysterious green, purple, or blue liquid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commonly used for various content concerning chemistry and science more generally. May represent various liquids, such as potions or&nbsp;medicines, as well as metaphorical laboratories and experiments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to the alembic&rsquo;s association with alchemy, this emoji may also convey a sense of magic. And, thanks to its resemblance to a glass pipe, some use the emoji&nbsp;to represent&nbsp;a bong or other drug paraphernalia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samsung&rsquo;s design <a href=\"/samsung/experience-9.0/alembic/\">previously featured</a>&nbsp;a copper still, as used for making <a href=\"/tumbler-glass/\">whiskey</a>.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the alembic emoji is a marvel of scientific artistry, featuring gleaming glass components with a lustrous sheen that catches the light. On Apple devices, the intricate curves and smooth gradients of the apparatus are rendered with exceptional clarity, showcasing Apple's dedication to detailed, realistic representation. The subtle reflections and depth created by the lighting emphasize the precision and complexity of this chemical tool, making it a sophisticated symbol for experimentation, distillation, or the pursuit of knowledge."
