  "description": "A person wearing a veil, often representing a bride on her wedding day. This version depicts a medium-dark skin tone.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the person with veil emoji, rendered in a medium-dark skin tone, presents a graceful and serene figure. The veil itself is depicted with subtle, soft folds and a gentle translucence, hinting at the contours of the face beneath through Apple’s signature realistic lighting. This emoji, with its dignified posture and smooth, rounded edges, conveys a sense of mystery, cultural tradition, or perhaps a quiet celebration, often used to represent weddings or important ceremonies in digital communication."
