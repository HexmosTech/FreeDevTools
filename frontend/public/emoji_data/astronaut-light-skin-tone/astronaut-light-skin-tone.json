  "description": "A person in a white astronaut suit with a helmet, representing space exploration, dreams, and ambition. The light skin tone variation is specified.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the astronaut emoji with light skin tone floats with a sense of wonder and adventure. Their white suit is rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, catching the light to emphasize its texture and protective qualities.  The visor, with its soft rounded edges, reflects a subtle, serene blue, hinting at the vastness of space and the brave exploration undertaken by humanity.  This emoji on Apple devices perfectly captures the spirit of discovery and reaching for the stars."
