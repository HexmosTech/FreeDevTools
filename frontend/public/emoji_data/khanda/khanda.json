The circular emblem and crossed swords are depicted with sharp, defined edges and subtle gradients, conveying a sense of strength and spiritual devotion. This symbol of Sikhism is presented with a dignified and respectful aesthetic, as seen across Apple’s emoji collection, embodying faith and unity."
