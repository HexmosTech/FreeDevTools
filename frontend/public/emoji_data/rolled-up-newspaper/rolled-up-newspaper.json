  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rolled-up newspaper emoji appears as a tightly bound scroll of newsprint, tied with a simple string and casting a subtle shadow that adds to its realistic 3D feel.  The texture of the paper is subtly suggested through soft gradients, making it a tactile representation of information and current events on Apple devices.  This emoji is ideal for signaling breaking news, discussions, or sharing articles and insights."
