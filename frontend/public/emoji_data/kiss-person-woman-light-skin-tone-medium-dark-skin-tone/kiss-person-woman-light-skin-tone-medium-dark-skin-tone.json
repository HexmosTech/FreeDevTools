This Apple-designed emoji features a woman with flowing hair and a gentle, closed-mouth expression, leaning in for a kiss, her skin tone gradient subtly shifting across the representation.  The characteristic glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients on Apple devices lend a feeling of warmth and intimacy, making it ideal for conveying affection, romance, or a fond farewell in digital communications."
