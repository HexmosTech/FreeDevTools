  "description": "Represents a romantic kiss between a woman with a lighter skin tone and a man with a medium skin tone. It conveys affection, love, and intimacy between a couple.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the kiss between a light-skinned woman and a medium-skinned person is depicted with tender affection, their faces softly angled towards each other with closed eyes. The glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients on their rounded cheeks, a hallmark of Apple's design, create a warm and intimate feeling. This emoji beautifully symbolizes romantic affection, a loving greeting, or a deep personal connection between two individuals."
