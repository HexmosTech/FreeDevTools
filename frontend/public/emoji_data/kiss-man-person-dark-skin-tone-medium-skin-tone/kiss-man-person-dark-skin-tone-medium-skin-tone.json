  "apple_vendor_description": "This iteration of the kiss emoji on Apple devices depicts a man with a medium-dark skin tone leaning in for a tender kiss, his lips pursed and a soft blush on his cheeks, all rendered with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading. The warm, realistic lighting accentuates the gentle curve of his head and the affectionate gesture. It conveys warmth, romance, and affectionate greetings, specifically representing a kiss from a man with this skin tone in the diverse emoji palette on Apple devices."
