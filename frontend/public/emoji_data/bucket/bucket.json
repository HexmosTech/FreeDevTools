  "apple_vendor_description": "The bucket emoji on Apple devices is depicted as a sturdy, classic container with a slightly weathered texture and a subtly glossy finish, reflecting Apple’s commitment to realistic object rendering. Its smooth, rounded edges and the way light gently plays off its surface give it a tangible feel, suggesting utility and readiness. Whether used to signify chores, gardening, or a need to 'kick the bucket' in a lighthearted way, this emoji on Apple devices is both functional and visually appealing."
