  "apple_vendor_description": "The kiss emoji between two men, rendered with dark skin tones on Apple devices, is a tender portrayal of intimacy and love. Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges give the figures a gentle, approachable appearance, while realistic lighting highlights their connection. The subtle, affectionate gesture between them, enveloped in the warm glow of Apple's design, powerfully communicates romance, partnership, and heartfelt devotion."
