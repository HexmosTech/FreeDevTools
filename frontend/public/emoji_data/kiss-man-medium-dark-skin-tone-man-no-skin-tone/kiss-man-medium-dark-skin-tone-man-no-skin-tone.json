  "description": "Represents a romantic kiss between two men, one with a medium-dark skin tone and the other with a default skin tone.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "This Apple emoji depicts two men in a tender kiss, rendered with Apple's signature 3D glossy shading and soft, rounded edges. The medium-dark skin tone is rich and nuanced, with subtle gradients that enhance the realism of their features, while the second man’s skin tone is absent, focusing the attention on their connected embrace on Apple devices. Their faces are gently pressed together, conveying affection and intimacy through expressive, closed eyes and softly pursed lips, embodying romantic connection in digital communication."
