His expression is neutral and approachable, with Apple's characteristic soft lighting and rounded edges lending a gentle realism to his features. The hand signal is clearly defined, symbolizing communication, understanding, and inclusivity, representing the deaf community with clarity and respect through Apple's thoughtful emoji design."
