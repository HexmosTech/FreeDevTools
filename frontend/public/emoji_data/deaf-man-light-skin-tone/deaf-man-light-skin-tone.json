  "description": "A man with a light skin tone, with his hand cupped to his ear and his thumb extended, indicating he is deaf or hard of hearing. This emoji signifies communication challenges or the deaf community.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The \"Deaf Man\" emoji with light skin tone, as seen on Apple devices, features a man's face with a distinct, understandable gesture of signing. His expression is neutral and approachable, with Apple's characteristic soft lighting and rounded edges lending a gentle realism to his features. The hand signal is clearly defined, symbolizing communication, understanding, and inclusivity, representing the deaf community with clarity and respect through Apple's thoughtful emoji design."
