  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the handshake emoji between a light skin tone and a medium-light skin tone hand appears as a symbol of agreement and collaboration, rendered with Apple's signature 3D realism.  The smooth gradients and gentle curves of the clasped hands convey a sense of trust and partnership, enhanced by subtle highlights that suggest polished surfaces. This emoji, with its warm, inviting presentation on Apple devices, is perfect for confirming deals, fostering camaraderie, or indicating mutual respect."
