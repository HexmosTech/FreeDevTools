  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the melting face emoji presents a surreal, almost liquid-like visage, with its features smoothly dissolving downwards. This Apple rendering captures a sense of overwhelming emotion, like extreme embarrassment, heat, or a feeling of being completely done, conveyed through subtle gradients and soft, rounded edges that suggest a fluid state. The overall effect is both humorous and relatable, perfectly embodying that moment when you wish you could just melt away, as seen on Apple’s vibrant displays."
