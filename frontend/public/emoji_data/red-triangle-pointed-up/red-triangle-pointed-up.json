  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the red triangle pointed up is a bold and striking geometric shape with a rich, saturated red color and a pronounced 3D appearance, thanks to Apple's masterful use of glossy shading and realistic lighting. Its sharp point and smooth surfaces communicate a sense of direction, caution, or an alert, often used to draw attention to important information or a warning."
