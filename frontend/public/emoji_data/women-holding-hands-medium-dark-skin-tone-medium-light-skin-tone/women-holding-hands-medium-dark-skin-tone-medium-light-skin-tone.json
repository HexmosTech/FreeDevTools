  "description": "Represents two women with different skin tones holding hands, symbolizing friendship, love, or partnership. This emoji specifically depicts a medium-dark skin tone and a medium-light skin tone.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendering of women holding hands, in this instance with medium-dark and medium-light skin tones, is a testament to inclusive design. Each hand is sculpted with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading, highlighting the subtle contours and realistic texture. The connection between the two hands is emphasized by soft light reflections and smooth transitions, conveying unity, friendship, or solidarity. This emoji on Apple devices is a powerful visual statement of support and companionship."
