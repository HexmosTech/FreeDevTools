  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's curling stone emoji is a testament to precision and sport, rendered with a polished, dark granite appearance that gleams under realistic lighting. The emoji exhibits Apple's hallmark smooth gradients and soft rounded edges, giving the stone a tangible, weighty feel. Its smooth, slightly worn surface speaks to the game's strategic nature, representing focus, skill, and the pursuit of a perfect slide in digital communication."
