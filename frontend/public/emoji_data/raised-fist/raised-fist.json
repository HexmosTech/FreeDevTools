  "apple_vendor_description": "The raised fist emoji on Apple devices is rendered with a strong, determined posture, its knuckles sharply defined yet softened by Apple's characteristic rounded edges. A dynamic interplay of realistic lighting and glossy 3D shading gives the fist a solid, powerful presence, often depicted in a vibrant, energetic hue. This emoji powerfully symbolizes solidarity, protest, support, or a declaration of strength and victory, conveying a message of unity and resolve."
