  "description": "This version of the  Person Juggling emoji has the  Medium Skin Tone applied, which is displayed as a Moderate Brown Skin Tone on suppor",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the person juggling emoji, presented in a medium skin tone, captures a dynamic sense of playful skill with its vibrant, rounded illustration style. The figures' limbs are fluid, and the tossed objects—often depicted with a slight glossy sheen—appear suspended in motion, a hallmark of Apple's 3D rendering. This emoji on Apple devices is perfect for expressing multitasking, excitement, or the challenge of handling multiple tasks with a lighthearted touch."
