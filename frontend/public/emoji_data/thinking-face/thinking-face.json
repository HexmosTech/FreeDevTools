  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the thinking face emoji presents a classic yellow face with a distinctly pensive expression, its left eyebrow subtly raised and its right hand gently resting on its chin. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading creates a soft, rounded form, with realistic lighting that emphasizes its thoughtful contemplation. This emoji beautifully captures a moment of deep thought, consideration, or gentle questioning in digital conversations."
