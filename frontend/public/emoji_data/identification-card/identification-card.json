  "apple_vendor_description": "The identification card emoji on Apple devices appears as a modern, rectangular card with a subtle glossy finish and soft, rounded corners, reflecting Apple’s commitment to clean and tactile design.  Its surface is clean, suggesting a space for a photo or important information, symbolizing identity, membership, or access.  This emoji is ideal for conveying concepts related to personal identification, security, or official documentation in a professional and stylized manner."
