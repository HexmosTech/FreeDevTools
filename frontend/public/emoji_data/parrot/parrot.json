  "apple_vendor_description": "The parrot emoji on Apple devices bursts with vibrant color, showcasing a tropical bird with emerald green plumage and bright blue accents, all brought to life with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading. Its cheerful, wide-eyed gaze and slightly tilted head give it an inquisitive and lively personality. This beautifully rendered emoji, with its realistic lighting and soft edges, is perfect for conveying a sense of exoticism, communication, or a bright, talkative mood."
