  "description": "<p>Depicted by major emoji vendors as blue square with a white letter &#39;P&#39; contained within it. Most often to represent a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_space\">parking space</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_lot\">parking lot</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of early 2022&nbsp;this emoji has frequently been used as a positive&nbsp;response on social media - &quot;that&#39;s 🅿️&quot;. This is due to an&nbsp;association with the song &#39;Pushing P&#39; by American rapper&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunna_(rapper)\">Gunna</a>.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The P button emoji on Apple devices presents a distinct, tactile representation of a physical button, rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading. Its smooth, rounded edges and subtle gradient suggest a satisfying press, often used to denote a 'play' function or a significant action within digital interfaces. On Apple devices, this emoji conveys a sense of control and immediate interactivity, a visual cue for starting or resuming an activity."
