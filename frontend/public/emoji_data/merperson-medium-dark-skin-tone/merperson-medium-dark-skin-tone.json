  "apple_vendor_description": "The merperson emoji with medium-dark skin tone on Apple devices features a beautifully rendered tail in shimmering scales, transitioning from a rich, deep hue to lighter tones with subtle, realistic lighting.  Its upper body is depicted with a gentle, poised posture, all brought to life with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and soft rounded edges for an almost mythical appearance.  This emoji represents enchantment, fantasy, and strength, adding a touch of the mystical to messages communicated on Apple devices."
