Its bright yellow facial orb is adorned with a prominent, glistening bead of sweat rolling down its forehead, rendered with Apple's signature realistic lighting and soft, rounded edges. The wide, toothy grin, combined with the sweat, suggests a near-miss or a strenuous task just completed, conveying a sense of relief, nervousness, or even exhilaration after a challenging situation."
