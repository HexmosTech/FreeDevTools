  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the black bird emoji is rendered with a sleek, obsidian finish, capturing the elegance of a raven or crow in flight. Its wings are softly curved with subtle gradients that suggest feathers, and a touch of Apple's signature glossy shading gives it a polished, almost jewel-like appearance. This emoji on Apple devices often symbolizes freedom, mystery, or a message delivered swiftly."
