  "apple_vendor_description": "The person with a skullcap emoji in a medium skin tone, as seen on Apple devices, presents a stylized individual with a relaxed posture and a distinctively designed skullcap. The cap is rendered with soft shading and rounded edges, characteristic of Apple's 3D aesthetic, creating a look that is both modern and approachable. On Apple devices, this emoji often conveys a sense of casual style, youthful energy, or a laid-back attitude, fitting perfectly into informal digital exchanges."
