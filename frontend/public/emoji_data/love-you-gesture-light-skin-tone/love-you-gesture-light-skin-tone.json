Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting give the hand a lifelike appearance, with smooth, rounded edges and subtle highlights that convey warmth and sincerity. This universally understood gesture, presented with Apple's characteristic tactile detail, is a heartfelt way to express affection and send love in digital messages."
