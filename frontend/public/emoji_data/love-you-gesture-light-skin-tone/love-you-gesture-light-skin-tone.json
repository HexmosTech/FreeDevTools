  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the 'Love You' gesture emoji is a beautifully articulated hand with a light skin tone, its fingers delicately forming the sign language for 'I love you.' Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting give the hand a lifelike appearance, with smooth, rounded edges and subtle highlights that convey warmth and sincerity. This universally understood gesture, presented with Apple's characteristic tactile detail, is a heartfelt way to express affection and send love in digital messages."
