  "apple_vendor_description": "This woman, depicted in a rich, dark skin tone on Apple devices, is presented in a moment of relaxation and rejuvenation within a steamy environment. Soft, diffused light catches the delicate water droplets and wisps of steam, creating a serene and luxurious atmosphere characteristic of Apple's attention to detail. The emoji's smooth gradients and subtle gloss evoke feelings of warmth, comfort, and self-care, often used to signify spa treatments, hot yoga, or a moment of blissful escape."
