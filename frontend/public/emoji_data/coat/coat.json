  "apple_vendor_description": "The coat emoji on Apple devices is a crisp, classic outerwear piece rendered with Apple's signature 3D depth and realistic fabric texture. Its smooth, rounded lapels and soft folds are highlighted by subtle gloss, giving it a tangible feel. Appearing in a neutral, versatile color, this emoji is perfect for indicating cold weather, preparing for an outing, or simply adding a touch of practical style to your messages."
