  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the hand with index finger and thumb crossed emoji in a medium skin tone is presented with a clean, clear gesture, symbolizing luck, hope, or a wish.  The polished surface of the hand, rendered with Apple's trademark glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting, makes the gesture feel tangible and encouraging.  This emoji on Apple devices is frequently used to convey best wishes or to express a strong desire for a positive outcome."
