Realistic lighting casts gentle highlights along its length, giving it a tactile feel, while the line extending from the tip is depicted with a delicate, almost invisible sheen. This emoji captures the essence of leisure, patience, and the pursuit of tranquility, often used to convey relaxation, outdoor activities, or the anticipation of a catch in messages shared on Apple devices."
