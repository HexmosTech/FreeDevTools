Its slightly rounded edges lend a touch of polish to the otherwise grim symbol, evoking a sense of danger, warning, or a playful, dramatic flair in digital communication. This iconic emblem, as seen on your iPhone or iPad, carries a universally understood message of peril or a lighthearted nod to something extreme."
