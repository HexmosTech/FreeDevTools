The face, rendered with smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges, features downturned lips and often narrowed eyes, creating a distinctly sulky expression. On Apple devices, the glossy 3D shading gives the face a life-like quality, making this emoji perfect for expressing mild annoyance, disappointment, or a playful sense of being grumpy."
