  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the white large square emoji is a minimalist yet impactful element, presented with Apple's signature smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges, creating a clean and modern aesthetic. Its pure white surface, subtly shaded to suggest depth and form, makes it a versatile building block for visual communication or a symbol of clarity and a fresh start. This emoji on Apple devices can be used to create visual patterns, represent a blank canvas, or signify a pause and reset in a conversation."
