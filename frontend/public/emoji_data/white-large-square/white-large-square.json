Its pure white surface, subtly shaded to suggest depth and form, makes it a versatile building block for visual communication or a symbol of clarity and a fresh start. This emoji on Apple devices can be used to create visual patterns, represent a blank canvas, or signify a pause and reset in a conversation."
