  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the large blue circle emoji presents a perfect, polished orb with a luminous, almost liquid quality.  Its deep cerulean shade is rendered with Apple\u2019s signature glossy 3D shading, featuring subtle highlights and soft gradients that suggest a perfectly smooth, rounded surface. This simple yet striking design conveys a sense of completeness, stability, or a bold, clear statement in digital conversations, often used to mark significant points or as a visual anchor.",
