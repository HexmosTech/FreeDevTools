  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the cow emoji is depicted with a friendly and gentle expression, its iconic black and white patches rendered with Apple’s characteristic glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting. The smooth, rounded form of its body and head, combined with soft gradients, gives it a charming and approachable appearance. This emoji is a delightful way to represent farm life, nature, or to add a touch of pastoral charm to digital conversations."
