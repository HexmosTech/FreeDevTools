  "apple_vendor_description": "The ice emoji on Apple devices presents a crystal-clear, multifaceted shard with sharp yet rounded edges, capturing the essence of frozen water. Apple's masterful use of realistic lighting and subtle reflections creates a sense of depth and translucency, making it appear cool and refreshing. The subtle glossy sheen and smooth gradients on its surface suggest its solid, pristine nature, commonly used to represent cold temperatures, chilly drinks, or a situation that is 'cool' or even frozen in time."
