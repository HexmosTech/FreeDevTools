  "description": "This version of the  Middle Finger emoji has the  Medium-light Skin Tone applied, which is displayed as a Cream White Skin Tone on suppo",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Rendered with Apple's signature smooth gradients and realistic lighting, the middle-finger emoji in a medium-light skin tone appears bold and defiant, yet retains a characteristic softness in its rounded edges.  The digit is clearly extended, with subtle shading that adds to its 3D depth and impact.  On Apple devices, this emoji is often used to express playful frustration, lighthearted rebellion, or a cheeky disagreement, conveying a strong, albeit often humorous, rejection."
