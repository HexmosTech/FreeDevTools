  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the polar bear emoji presents a majestic and serene creature, rendered with Apple's characteristic soft rounded edges and gentle 3D shading. Its thick, white fur is depicted with subtle highlights that suggest its natural habitat, while its calm, stoic expression evokes a sense of resilience and peacefulness. This emoji is often used to represent cold environments, the Arctic, or to convey a feeling of quiet strength and gentle solitude in digital communication."
