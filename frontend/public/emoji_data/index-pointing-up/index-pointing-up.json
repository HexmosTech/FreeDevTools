  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the index-pointing-up emoji is rendered with a smooth, rounded digit, bathed in the signature Apple realistic lighting that gives it a tangible, almost three-dimensional presence.  Its gently curved fingernail and subtle shading emphasize its upward direction, conveying emphasis, importance, or a clear indication of something above. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is a direct and friendly way to signal attention or highlight a specific point in digital conversations."
