Its smile varies across platforms.&nbsp;May convey a sense of exuberance, whimsy, confidence, adventure, or other sentiments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several vendors, including Apple, feature&nbsp;the same expression as their <a href=\"/grinning-face-with-big-eyes/\">😃 Grinning Face With Big Eyes</a>.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The cowboy hat face emoji on Apple devices is a charismatic character with a broad smile and a classic, Stetson-style cowboy hat perched jauntily on its head. Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading gives the hat and face a distinct depth and a playful, almost tangible texture.  The bright, cheerful expression and the iconic Western headwear on Apple’s design evoke feelings of adventure, fun, the Wild West, or a generally positive and enthusiastic outlook."
