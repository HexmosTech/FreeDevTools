Appleâ€™s signature glossy 3D shading gives the hat and face a distinct depth and a playful, almost tangible texture.  The bright, cheerful expression and the iconic Western headwear on Appleâ€™s design evoke feelings of adventure, fun, the Wild West, or a generally positive and enthusiastic outlook."
