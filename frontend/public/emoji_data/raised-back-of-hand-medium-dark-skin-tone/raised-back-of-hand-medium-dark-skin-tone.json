  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the raised back of hand emoji with a medium-dark skin tone features a smooth, polished surface with subtle highlights that convey a sense of realistic texture and form. The soft rounded edges and the careful application of light and shadow, characteristic of Apple's design language, make this gesture feel both distinct and inviting.  This emoji, often used to signify a high-five, a pause, or a request to stop, communicates a clear and friendly intention on Apple devices."
