Its vibrant, solid color, often a deep blue or red, is rendered with Apple's signature smooth gradients and realistic lighting, making it appear polished and clickable. This emoji is frequently used to indicate selection, choice, or a definitive option within forms or decision-making processes in digital communication on Apple devices."
