  "description": "<p>Two people hugging, shown as faceless blue forms on most platforms. Details of each person are not distinct and thus no options are available to customize the gender or skin tone of either individual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not to be confused with <a href=\"/hugging-face/\">🤗 Hugging Face</a>, which is less clearly a representation of hugging and sometimes used as jazz hands or to express excitement.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The people hugging emoji on Apple devices presents two figures embracing with a comforting and gentle posture, rendered in Apple's characteristic soft rounded edges and smooth gradients.  The realistic lighting and subtle shading give the impression of warmth and closeness, conveying a profound sense of support and affection.  This emoji, as it appears on Apple devices, is a powerful symbol of comfort, solidarity, and emotional connection, perfect for expressing care and understanding."
